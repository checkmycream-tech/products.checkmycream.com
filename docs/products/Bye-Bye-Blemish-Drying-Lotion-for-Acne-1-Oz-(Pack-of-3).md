<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of my most fave products to use!&lt;br /&gt;I use it when i have sever breakouts, and it clears them right up over night!&lt;br /&gt;But i still have issues with the red marks left. i love how it helps get rid of swollen acne, but the leftover red spot is annoying...</li>
    <li> This stuff is, hands down, the BEST for drying yup blemishes very quickly; I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for years, but as of late can not find it at any of the pharmacies in the area.  It&#x27;s undoubtedly the best product for its purpose on the market.  For spot treatment, oxy, clearasil, or whatever new gimmick solution is out there don&#x27;t hold a candle to it.</li>
    <li> wow! quick and easy! this really does work!</li>
    <li> Very effective drying solution.  Not nice to look at once applied, especially if you are of a darker skin tone. But it does work.  Of course, I don&#x27;t know anyone who is this weird, opaque pink shade, do you?</li>
    <li> Wish I had found this when my 25yo was a teen - or when I was!  My 16yo son and 12yo daughter use this and it works very well.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works on my teenage son&#x27;s acne, and it works extremely well and fast.  He is so happy that I discovered this product.</li>
    <li> So glad that I got the opportunity to test out this product. I love it so much! Highly recommended ! :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product for that occasional pimple - dryes out the redness overnight and makes it heal quickly!</li>
    <li> A perfect dupe for the Mario Basedcu drying cream or the Kate Somerville eradiKate. Works great. You look a little goofy wearing this stuff, so save it for nighttime or days when you&#x27;ll be home alone and without a visit from the UPS guy.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have extremely oily skin, &amp; this helped dry up my pimples a lot. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I used to order this product from Mario Badescu and would pay $17.00 for 1 bottle alone! The active ingredients are the same and for $10.00 more than Mario Badescu I now get 3 bottles instead of 1. The active ingredients of sulfur and zinc work great and are miracle workers for over night blemish reduction. I have used this product for a long time and rely only it. This is the best acne treatment ever!</li>
    <li> great deal for the money, works quickly</li>
    <li> My mom used this alot when I was younger and It&#x27;s my go to when I get a break out. Apply with a q-tip and go to bed, next day they pimples usually gone or small enough not to be as visible. I love this stuff .</li>
    <li> I really like it. It dries up the acne rapidly.  But for those who think this can cure the scar. No it does not function this way. But i would highly recommend this to those that fight against acne.</li>
    <li> really dries the blemish</li>
    <li> hard to find ~ works overnight many times</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be used with just a dab of the concentrate from the bottom. You can do that, but I find it isn&#x27;t overly drying as an all-over lotion. It feels nice. Of course, it&#x27;s very pink, but you can just put mineral powder on your face, over the dried pink solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After just 24 hours, there is considerable improvement in my slow-healing blemishes. The Bye Bye Blemish is killing the infection and letting my skin heal (finally). I apply it to broken skin, and it starts drying and healing the tiny wounds. It doesn&#x27;t come out very easily, but a warm shower will get it out, so I won&#x27;t be going out with pink spots on my face :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received the Clarisonic Mia facial brush, and I&#x27;m in love with that already. I use it with Grisi sulfur soap; then clean with hydrogen peroxide; then apply the Bye Bye Blemish as an all-over mask. Not everyone can take that full regimen; my skin is tough, so be careful if you try all of that! The Bye Bye Blemish is 10%, the strongest I&#x27;ve seen, and it&#x27;s like a miracle for me. Won&#x27;t always clear blemishes overnight, but it&#x27;s fast and powerful. Also contains \\&quot;maximum strength salicylic acid.\\&quot; For me, it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
    <li> Like I had said in a different review, these things work great but only buy them two at a time. By the time you get to your third bottle, it&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as the first two were. It loses its strength after sitting too long. Overall good product though.</li>
    <li> It works in drying my pimples overnight.</li>
    <li> Great product! For how much you pay you get 10x more and it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> It does leave calamine lotion looking pink blotches on your skin after application. These are often absorbed into your skin overnight.</li>
    <li> Great product. It really works.</li>
    <li> Awesome drying lotion. Just dab it on at night by the next morning the blemish is almost gone. I don&#x27;t have severe acne however I do get break outs here and there.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product.  I found it when I was looking for Mario Badescu lotions, and decided to give it a shot since it&#x27;s a much better price!  i&#x27;m only on my first bottle but I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Great overnight treatment for the occasional zit.  Wash your face as usual before bed then use a Q-Tip to dip inside the bottle and dab the solution on the zit.  Let it dry, then reapply.  Go to sleep and wake up with better skin.  Yeah, it&#x27;s really that simple.  Do NOT shake the bottle (you will want to, but trust me and resist the urge)....it will decrease the effectiveness of the drying lotion.  It is supposed to be pink on the bottom with clear liquid on top.</li>
    <li> Works excellent... Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> For years I tried numerous acne treatments, both high end and drugstore types. I even purchased expensive gadgets that promised to get rid of zits in record time. For me personally, I never saw noticeable results in a shorter amount of time than when I used this. When needed, I use this as a spot treatment before I go to bed and by morning there is a noticeable difference in the size of the blemish. The only negative is the sulfer smell but given the results, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving the Bye Bye blemish. I wanted so bad for it to work on my skin and it did nothing! I followed the directions and didn&#x27;t attempt to shake it, but I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s just not working, and on top of that I have 2 more unopened bottles that I don&#x27;t need.---</li>
    <li> I thought this was goin to be the greatest solution to pimples. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m really dissappointed. When I woke up in the morning it as though I didn&#x27;t do anything! They were still big and red as the night before. I don&#x27;t want others to waste their money, I don&#x27;t believe it works as they say it does :-(</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few days and I am already noticing my acne disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works! I love it and am very pleased. Thank you so much. Shipping was fast as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before in high school, and it&#x27;s still effective. You should try it if you haven&#x27;t and have struggled with other brands.</li>
    <li> i m really glad i found this!</li>
    <li> Came on time, exactly as described - this is an oldie but a goodie - much less expensive than the current &amp;#34;designer brand&amp;#34; sulfur drying lotions that do the same thing!  This takes care of oily shiny foreheads, and gives good spot control for localized acne blemishes. Great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome product at a great price! Best spot treatment I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My son uses this product, not me. It is actually the only product he uses for his blemishes. He had moderate acne is high school and we tried many things (dermatologist prescribed medicine, ProActiv, OTC) and this was the only product that really worked. Once we found it he stopped using everything else except this and his skin looked so good! This is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> the best still get blemishes here and there overnight there gone. Makes a good oil free base for make-up  This is the best and does not dry your skin out</li>
    <li> best stuff ever for your face</li>
    <li> It has 10 percent sulfur which is much higher than any other brand.  It is very effective sand cheaper than Mario badescu, the only negative is that the alcohol suspension agent dries out very quickly compared to other sulfur agents.</li>
    <li> This really works. Have a pimple put a dab of this on and the zit will be zapped in a day or two.</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews it was a no brainer, 3 bottles of By Bye for almost the cost of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand.  Looks, smells, and apply&#x27;s basically the same, but that is where the similarity ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The pink stuff is not very substantial - flakes off very easily, if I apply it well before bed, it may have all flaked off on it&#x27;s own - the name brand one stays put, and has to be scrubbed off the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Results for me were not very good with this product, I applied almost nightly for more than a week on one outbreak, in the past with the other brand, 2 applications were about all you needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My perspective, get the real thing and pass on Bye Bye - it just doesn&#x27;t work as efficiently.</li>
    <li> One of the best drying lotions out there over the counter. It will calm down &amp; dry pimples and leave a dry flat base to start healing back.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my son&#x27;s acne.  I was buying another brand that cost MORE for 1 bottle.  I started shopping around and found 3 for the price of one with the exact same ingredients.  This stuff really works.  He puts it on any blemishes and within a day or two they are dried up.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted - please with the order</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this years ago, as I recall she didn&#x27;t think it was anything special for breakouts. BUT, when I was desperately searching the medicine cabinet for anything to relieve the horrible horrible itching and ugly redness from a ton of gnat bites, I found her old bottle of this. I remember teasing her it was just super strong calamine lotion. It was completely dried to a lump. I just added water and shook it a while. I dabbed every last bite, and in the morning they were 90% dried up and the redness was about gone. I live in the South and will always keep this around for bites.</li>
    <li> Good stuff ! Quick shipping :) packaged good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer that skin care doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive. This lotion is a testament to that fact. This is the same product as Mari... uh, the other more expensive brand. It smells the same, feels the same, and even has the same active ingredients. If you use another drying lotion that costs a bundle, give this lotion a shot. You&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> This product helped me get rid of blemishes from my pregnancy. I highly recommend it. I use a Q-tip to dip into the solution and apply to the blemishes. It&#x27;s best to apply at night.</li>
    <li> Good  product and good seller.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes a great spot treatment for a great price. It came highly recommended on Reddit (r/skincareaddiction), but I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve been using the stuff since it came in the mail and haven&#x27;t been more pleased. Just make sure you have q-tips on hand!</li>
    <li> my kids swear by this stuff.  My daughter uses it weekly and loves the results she gets.  Definetly buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this,  it really works.</li>
    <li> One dab at night and the blemish is dried up in the morning. I used a bottle, gave one to my daughter, and one to my sister. They all agreed that it works to clear up blemishes. Goes on smelling like a calamine lotion, but smells a little sulfur like when dry. Will not bleach your pillow case like products with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
    <li> The real deal! Face has been acne free ever since.</li>
    <li> Great results love it</li>
    <li> My son uses this product all the time. Bought three bottles, better bang for my buck. Nice product, very pleased</li>
    <li> works fantastic1 we originally bought a more expensive brand. this one is just as good if not BETTER! love it, and will order it again! and AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Ok so my face was clearing up and i wanted something to help speed up the healing bad idea this crap gave me cystic zits bad i put it on healing pimples and the next day i woke up and they were no longer almost gone they were back 10 time biger than they were omg i dnt want to leave my house dont buy this</li>
    <li> I love this amazing product. It works wonders on drying out blemishes overnight.... I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over ten years and find it is helpful both for drying up zits as well as reducing their redness.  It has been disappointing however that, in recent years, the manufacturer has apparently been watering down the product.  The last half inch in the small bottle is almost unusable.  It used to be that I added a few drops of alcohol to use up the very dregs of the pink stuff but no more.  Still it is a useful component of your acne arsenal - helpful - but not a miracle cure by itself.      I do want to add that, when the potion is still wet, it can stain.  I got some on my bedspread and nothing seems to remove it.  When it is dry, it flakes and some will fall onto clothing etc. but that has not been a problem.  So my advice is to use a little care until it dries.    Another tip (unrelated to this particular product) is that, when the zit is dried up but still red looking, you can apply a dab of Manuka honey on it and leave on overnight.  Any honey should help but Manuka is especially healing.</li>
    <li> Nothing any other blemish drying lotion doesn&#x27;t do.  Plus you need to store it upright and you need Q-tips to use product.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this product. It works great each time I use it. I often have acne blemish on my face and each time I use this product, like magic, the black spots just disappears! I am so grateful that there is this product on the market. I love it so much and have recommended it to my friends. I can&#x27;t live without it for sure.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s made of the same solution my expensive brand was so I&#x27;m hoping it works the same.  I ordered it and it came right away.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for my adult acne and now I have my teenage son using it for his--it is remarkable how well it helps over just one night.</li>
    <li> Pimples took even longer to heal.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;ve had tiny breakouts for about 2 years and this quickly helped to dry out the pimples. I want to also recommend something that&#x27;s going to make the skin healthier once the breakouts are calmer. This is what I use:  http://amzn.to/1dy30OA  Many acne sufferers have used it and have seen faster and better results! It&#x27;s important to know how to use it  to achieve the maximum results. You can also try this sulfur soap  :  http://goo.gl/fg3ttb  to help calm the breakouts. make sure you&#x27;re not allergic to sulfur before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;When everything looks calmer, meaning less inflamed, less red, then you can use this:  http://amzn.to/1dy30OA  to help speed up the healing, to exfoliate the dead skin, and to clear up all the blemishes. Good luck and don&#x27;t lose hope! It will be better soon! :)</li>
    <li> A Hollywood makeup artist friend turned me on to this product a few years ago - apparently they use this on tons of movie/TV sets, photo shoots, etc. This is the best salicylic lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and the only one that&#x27;s been effective for me at reducing those deep-down cystic blemishes, almost overnight.</li>
    <li> This product is magic in a bottle.  I really gets rid of blemishes overnight.  I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product from a local store but no one carries it anymore. The price was better than what the store charged when the store use to stalk it.</li>
    <li> been using it for years.  works good</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and way cheaper than the alternative brand. I used it the first night I got it and the pimple was gone in the morning!</li>
    <li> Bottom line is that for me, this stuff works better than anything that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  At first, I didn&#x27;t believe the claim that there would be results overnight. But it&#x27;s true. When I use this product at night before I go to bed, I see noticeable improvement the next morning. With consistent use, a decent sized zit will be gone in a matter of a few days. Much faster than anything else.  My girlfriend also uses it and she has seen similar results. Neither one of us has bad acne, but we still like to have it at all times for the occasional breakout. It literally stops zits in their tracks and get rid of them fast. It&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been breaking out lately due to too much Cheetos, and these help. I already finished 3 bottles before but one was left open by accident and dried up. Had to get some more.  You know a product is good when you can buy it using FSA funds, and this is even FSARX.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! It clears pimples overnight. I can&#x27;t find anything else on the market that works this well for teen acne.</li>
    <li> Again my family has our occasional break out.  Dap this on before you go to  bed and it really helps.  I have to use this myself some times.  And It is a great product.  You can compare this to the television ad products.  It is really a great product.</li>
    <li> My kids have tried other products, but always come back to this. It is the most effective medicine we&#x27;ve found for quickly drying up zits!</li>
    <li> this stuff is great! It really will dry out a pimple. I tried another product which was double the price for just one bottle. It&#x27;s really the same ingredients. Not that complex stuff. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The product works well. It accelerate the acne cycle so your acne can goes away much faster than if it was left alone.</li>
    <li> I use this on spot acne and poison Ivy. I ordered my first bottle years ago and it last a long time. When the alcohol on top runs low, just pour in more then let it settle and it will last longer.</li>
    <li> Used a similar product that was double the money and this works just as good possibility better!</li>
    <li> Not working. It also makes my skin really dry.</li>
    <li> will cure your zit problem. upon first sign of a zit put some on and within a day or two&lt;br /&gt;it will be healed.  i shake mine even tho it says not to, im guesskng&lt;br /&gt;becauae of the pink color . my elderly mother likes it to heal up&lt;br /&gt;scrapes and bangs on her arms too.</li>
    <li> This product made my husband face burn and rash  I would lik to return it but we were on vacation and got back to day but I don&#x27;t think I should be penilized please giveme a answer thank you.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the original !!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for my kids.  It usually knocks down acne for them overnight.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than anything out on the market today</li>
    <li> This is a must have if you have any kind of acne. I just dab on a spot that starts to come up and if goes away in more than half the time it would normally take!</li>
    <li> Very good results after dew days</li>
    <li> Helpful as a part of skin care for acne, good drying and disinfecting effect, would not work alone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous drying lotions including Mario Badescu.  This one seems somewhat thinner, but does a better job.  Best of all, it comes in a three pack and is MUCH less expensive than the drying lotion I bought at Sephora.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have acne-prone skin, but when it&#x27;s &amp;#34;my special time of the month&amp;#34;, Mother Nature isn&#x27;t very kind.  She likes to send me surprises upon my face.  And not petite surprises, either, gigantic, &amp;#34;can&#x27;t-ignore-with-all-your-might&amp;#34; surprises. I had tried toothpaste, oatmeal, all the other remedies to reduce a blemish overnight.  Nothing worked--UNTIL THIS!!  I kid you not!!  This stuff works for me like a charm!!!!  If I even see a blemish starting to form, I dab this stuff on, and it disappears or reduces drastically overnight!  It does contain alcohol, and I KNOW you&#x27;re not supposed to put alcohol on your face, but it&#x27;s just a touch!  It TRULY dries up the blemish!  I have also put it on under my makeup during the day, and by the end of the day, the blemish has dried up.  This is honestly the BEST spot treatment I&#x27;ve ever used on my blemishes!</li>
    <li> Bought for my grandsons--both were disappointed with ProActive results but this seems to be working well--if only they would use it ALL the time!</li>
    <li> not that useful as I thought</li>
    <li> Great product!  Simply THE BEST for FAST acne clear up.  Also, FANSTASTIC to use on any open wound if not too too deep bcuz the contents are sulphur, a known bacterial killer.  As a microbiologist whom has used this product for years to treat besides acne on teenage sins and friends, a wide range of wounds from ingrown toenail infection, to burns to infected ingrown hairs, etc, there simply is NOTHING better on the market .... including most prescription topicals.</li>
    <li> Great for small flare-ups.  Just dip a q-tip in bottle and dab a little on the spot the night before, and the next day it would be almost gone.  For larger pimples, it does take a few days for it to be reduced.  Just remember to quickly close the bottle after dipping, so not to dry out the liquid.</li>
    <li> Great product for pimples!  I used daily and dried out cysts and pimples rather quickly. I always make sure to keep alot in stock.</li>
    <li> my friend gave me one 3 years ago.  It was good.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s good as my memory and I gave 2 to my friends. They love it as I do.</li>
    <li> Product is expensive at $7.33/oz, but it does help with Acne.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this drying lotion in my teenage years, now I am in my late 20&#x27;s and I still keep it on hand in case of a stubborn break out.&lt;br /&gt;Bye bye blemish is by far the best spot treatment for acne!&lt;br /&gt;I apply to stubborn pimples with a q-tip before bed and the pimple is magically dried up by the time I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;At times I have applied a thicker coat than I probably needed to and found that the lotion begins to flake when it is drying. This is generally not an issue if the break out is on the lower areas of the face but I have had experiences with applying it to my forehead area and waking up with burning eyes as particles had flaked into my eyes overnight. This is easily avoided by simply applying thinner layers.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing how quickly you will say goodbye to blemishes with this lotion!</li>
    <li> I will never be without this! Great for those unexpected break outs! It works and lasts so long! This is my second order. Love it!</li>
    <li> Does not work as great as advertised. People rave about this product and it&#x27;s ability to clear pimples overnight but I have not seen results as others claim. It&#x27;s easy to apply but dries surface skin and pimples are still there</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne my since I was 13 and occasionally still do... I&#x27;m now 33. I&#x27;ve tried everything out there and this is the only product that has worked for me.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this because its SOO much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have cystic acne, I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mario brand would make a zit go away over night, if anything get rid of all the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works maybe 1/3 as well. I think it would do wonders if you have very light acne but if it&#x27;s deep at all I don&#x27;t think it works well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it really didn&#x27;t change anything :(</li>
    <li> Very good at drying out potential breakouts without reddening.  Wear when sleeping as it is a true light pink, and I don&#x27;t know too many people with that skin shade.  Be careful with container...it is glass, with a good size opening...easy to knock over accidentally and spill completely.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this stuff! It dries up blemishes in 24-48 hours.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Starts clearing up my acne overnight!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Dries out pimples quickly.</li>
    <li> This drying lotion is comparable to the Mario Badescu drying lotion, but is way more effective on my skin. It dries out most of my pimples overnight. Amazing!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this stuff and I have even used it a couple times for a blemish that has popped up and the next day it is gone. We bought our first bottle about 8-9 months ago and it lasted for over 4 months before we had to get another bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like the Bye Bye Blemish product and have bought it a few other times.  If you have a pimple under the skin, this lotion will help dry it up before it surfaces, if the blemish is not too deep.  I use this a lot on my chin to dry up the sebum and keep pimples away.  It is very mild, and I have very sensitive skin, so it works great for me and doesn&#x27;t sting.  I will continue buying it for mild acne, but will continue to use benzoyl peroxide for my cystic acne.</li>
    <li> This is the only acne spot lotion that really works.  It is an overnight success story.  It makes a huge difference, but can never find in the stores.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders!! :)</li>
    <li> I have food allergies which often cause itchy breakouts.  This dries up the breakout and soothes the itching.  I have used hundreds of prescription products because of my extreme allergies and nothing soothes the itchiness better than this product.  It says do not shake, but I shake it up and it works best that way.</li>
    <li> this stuff is ok it doesnt work very well for me tho. I just gave my other bottles to my friends and hopefully itd work for one of them. But so far nothin...had it for at least a month...wont buy again</li>
    <li> This ish make muh face all clear n shiet</li>
</ol>
