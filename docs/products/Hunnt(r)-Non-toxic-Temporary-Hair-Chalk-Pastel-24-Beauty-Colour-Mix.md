      <li>I like it because it washes out easy!</li>
      <li>and it gives it more color to it.)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>I can say that I am a satisfied customer...</li>
      <li>When I run out, I&#x27;m sure I will buy more again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i was expecting better results</li>
      <li>:}</li>
      <li>and she was able to get more of it out</li>
      <li>and I love wearing it in my hair.</li>
      <li>Packaging needs to be better; more directions, etc.  </li>
      <li>(If you brush your hair before it dries most of the color will come out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great fun, easy to use and easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this item to any one who loves to have fun!!</li>
      <li>love the product, easy to use ......</li>
      <li>It is vary easy to use</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply even they can do it their selves.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and washes out just like the instructions says.  </li>
      <li>but they are quite cheap</li>
      <li>nothing special just regular pastels didn&#x27;t work that great in my daughters med brown hair</li>
      <li>I especially loved the teal, pink, and purples, they worked really well in my hair!</li>
      <li>I have not yet used this product, but quickly realized upon opening the package that these are artist&#x27;s pastels.</li>
      <li>I have been having a lot of fun</li>
      <li>trust me is worth it</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are nice and neat, they wash out, and they should last a while.</li>
      <li>so i could use it right away</li>
      <li>Be aware, this chalk doesn&#x27;t wash out all that easily so don&#x27;t get too wild with a weekend look if it will cause problems at the office on Monday.</li>
      <li>I will read more closer next time.</li>
      <li>at first they came cracked</li>
      <li>then I thought, but I think that worked better because it gave me more control to select small sections of hair.</li>
      <li>thank you also for the follow up email where i was able to get instructions personally from seller.</li>
      <li>They turned up really well in my hair!</li>
      <li>My son and daughter love all the different colors.</li>
      <li>Also, a lot of them arrived broken, and upon use, even more broke very easily.</li>
      <li>It applies easy and stays in longer then regular hair chalk bought at the store.</li>
      <li>I basically made my hair into a rainbow which was easy to do because I have blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>the pastels are only 2 1/2 inches long but other than that they are great!</li>
      <li>I really like how these pastels apply to my hair.</li>
      <li>Though the sticks ARE very slender and break quite easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>really like it</li>
      <li>I have light blonde hair</li>
      <li>My daughter saw a similar product at Urban Outfitters so I scanned Amazon for a better price and found this hair chalk.</li>
      <li>the next day i tried again and finally i see the difference ,it was better the the day before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it came early!</li>
      <li>However, they can also be used for the hair,but it is evident they were not manufactured with such purpose in mind.</li>
      <li>I think this is the first time I actually give a review...</li>
      <li>I would give them five stars, but noticed that upon first use, many of the \\&quot;chalks\\&quot; were broken</li>
      <li>but I am stuck with a little more that is left.  </li>
      <li>I decided I needed to go get this professionally fixed because I had a job interview.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is getting more and more products from out of the country:( I would have not ordered them.</li>
      <li>However it made my hair very crusty looking and was super hard to style.  </li>
      <li>I have Dark brown hair and tried the magenta (top, 5 to the left), blue (bottom, 3 to the right), turquoise (bottom, 4 to the left), periwinkle blue (bottom, 4 to the right), and lime green (bottom, 3 to the left).</li>
      <li>i can barely see it</li>
      <li>,it got all over my bathroom and my hair started getting knots in it.i can barely see the color in my hair.</li>

<li> ,it got all over my bathroom and my hair started getting knots in it.i can barely see the color in my hair.</li>
<li> but it comes off after you wash your hands 3-4 times, 3rd of all it is smaller than in the picture or what i expected it to be</li>
<li> I bought this not too long ago.</li>
<li> I went 2 weeks and the pink and blue colors would still not come out of my hair.  </li>
<li> Air dry it or you can blow dry it on low.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
<li> this is only an imitation!</li>
<li> If you want to dress up an outfit, or go a little different for a holiday, this hair chalk is for you.</li>
<li> I bought this item excited for so many choices in hair chalk color, but was very disappointed to see that the chalk is too hard and does not color the hair.</li>
<li> Wet the part of your hair you want to color.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
<li> wet my daughters hair with a spray bottle</li>
<li> /&gt;DO wet the section of hair that you wish to chalk-color</li>
<li> But i suggest getting your hair wet</li>
<li> Even with extreme friction, all I got was damaged hair.</li>
<li> Pick the color you want, go up and down with the pastel in your hair.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say that they are not formulated differently than &#x27;actual&#x27; hair-geared pastels, but I am a bit skeptical.</li>
<li> but then every time i try to use it, it left my hair so dry and difficult to handle</li>
<li> The hair stylist with hair dye could not get the pink out of my hair!!!</li>
<li> She likes colouring her hair, and sometimes it&#x27;s a messy endeavour when it involves Kool-Aid, etc.&lt;br</li>
<li> and i tried with small curl of hair .</li>
<li> it is very messy on your hands</li>
<li> the beginning i was so bumped about it  because the color does not show on my hair even if i rub it sooo hard</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t show up on my daughters hair, which is dirty blonde.</li>
<li> works well, difficult to show up in dark reddish hair.</li>
<li> This colored the hair but was messy and came off on the hands really bad.  </li>
<li> needless to say it&#x27;s like i have a bunch of chalk sitting around with not packaging for it to be stored in.</li>
<li> I was counting on this product, took a chance and it failed me.</li>
<li> she was disappointed to say the least</li>
<li> I am very disappointed with this product.when</li>
<li> I am afraid to use!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this chalk was very easy to use!!we wet my daughters hair with a spray bottle and it worked great!!!My daughter LOVES IT!!Fast shipping too!!</li>
    <li> I have been having a lot of fun this this hair chalk.  It is easy to apply and washes out just like the instructions says.  If you want to dress up an outfit, or go a little different for a holiday, this hair chalk is for you.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware, sellers passing regular drawing pastels for hair chalk, guess I will order a sketch pad since I bought 2 boxes yAy!</li>
    <li> Though the sticks ARE very slender and break quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;DO wet the section of hair that you wish to chalk-color PRIOR to rubbing the chalk thereupon - that is the ONLY way in which the color will truly adhere. Don&#x27;t drench, but have nice and damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived well packaged.</li>
    <li> will look great in my daughters hair and also her friends. she has always wanted to try this and we cant get in locally.</li>
    <li> This is not Catalina temporary hair chalk, this is the same $2.99 per box chalk you buy for your kids to play with, no directions for use - don&#x27;t be sucked into this.</li>
    <li> the shipping was amazing and the product even better. I can say that I am a satisfied customer... :} I think this is the first time I actually give a review... trust me is worth it</li>
    <li> I bought this not too long ago. I was hoping the package would come on time so i could use it right away and it came early! I have Dark brown hair and tried the magenta (top, 5 to the left), blue (bottom, 3 to the right), turquoise (bottom, 4 to the left), periwinkle blue (bottom, 4 to the right), and lime green (bottom, 3 to the left). They turned up really well in my hair! But i suggest getting your hair wet and then put it in. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because 1st of all it is just painters pastel but it still works for your hair, 2nd of all it is very messy on your hands but it comes off after you wash your hands 3-4 times, 3rd of all it is smaller than in the picture or what i expected it to be it is a 6 1/2 inch by 6 1/2 inch box and the pastels are only 2 1/2 inches long but other than that they are great! I would say follow these steps:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wet the part of your hair you want to color.&lt;br /&gt;2. Pick the color you want, go up and down with the pastel in your hair. (I know it will make it ratty but you can brush it and it gives it more color to it.)&lt;br /&gt;3. Air dry it or you can blow dry it on low.&lt;br /&gt;4. Then brush your hair. (If you brush your hair before it dries most of the color will come out.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it and i hope you do too!</li>
    <li> I ordered Catalina Chen Hair Chalk, and got Masters Pastel art chalk. Not what I wanted!!! I had ordered this for a friends daughter for her birthday because she wanted hair chalk, not art chalk.</li>
    <li> this is only an imitation! this is not the hair chalk that the publication says, its just mainstream pastels colors for painting! at first they came cracked but i didn&#x27;t complain, but then every time i try to use it, it left my hair so dry and difficult to handle, i don&#x27;t like it at all, i wont recommend this at all, and i wont buy again, in fact i would like my money back but they are quite cheap so it doesn&#x27;t have sense.</li>
    <li> I am afraid to use!!! I did not know they were from China. Amazon is getting more and more products from out of the country:( I would have not ordered them. I will read more closer next time. I was on my fire when I  ordered  and could not see the writing on the box. Bummer!!!!I would return, but don&#x27;t want to pay to ship these back!!!Soooo Disapointing!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item excited for so many choices in hair chalk color, but was very disappointed to see that the chalk is too hard and does not color the hair. I rubbed it on my hair and all it did was break the hair, did not leave any color. I need to get around to requesting a return!</li>
    <li> I ordered these as part of a birthday present for one of my kids. She likes colouring her hair, and sometimes it&#x27;s a messy endeavour when it involves Kool-Aid, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice and neat, they wash out, and they should last a while. I would give them five stars, but noticed that upon first use, many of the \\&quot;chalks\\&quot; were broken - maybe they need to be wider and shorter so that they are a bit tougher.</li>
    <li> love the product, easy to use ...... once you get instructions. Only suggestion is that you mail the instructions. i attempted using them before an think i may have ruined a couple not using proper procedures. so mail instuctions and i think you have wonderful product. thank you also for the follow up email where i was able to get instructions personally from seller. good luck with your business</li>
    <li> nothing special just regular pastels didn&#x27;t work that great in my daughters med brown hair she was disappointed to say the least</li>
    <li> So I put this in my hair for Halloween.  I basically made my hair into a rainbow which was easy to do because I have blonde hair.  However it made my hair very crusty looking and was super hard to style.  The biggest problem I had with it though was it washing out.  I went 2 weeks and the pink and blue colors would still not come out of my hair.  It was at this point I decided I needed to go get this professionally fixed because I had a job interview.  The hair stylist with hair dye could not get the pink out of my hair!!! We tried to get it out and it wouldn&#x27;t!! I went back to the hairstylist again the next day and she was able to get more of it out but I am stuck with a little more that is left.  So be weary when and how you use this product.  You may be stuck with colored hair for quite a bit with no way to remove it.</li>
    <li> I have not yet used this product, but quickly realized upon opening the package that these are artist&#x27;s pastels. I can&#x27;t say that they are not formulated differently than &#x27;actual&#x27; hair-geared pastels, but I am a bit skeptical. We&#x27;ll see how they do in hair! I am hoping the color will not transfer to clothing or sheets.</li>
    <li> Be aware, this chalk doesn&#x27;t wash out all that easily so don&#x27;t get too wild with a weekend look if it will cause problems at the office on Monday.</li>
    <li> works well, difficult to show up in dark reddish hair. and proccess kinda makes hair frizzy. but i like it</li>
    <li> i was worried when i saw the white box not a word written on it and this makes me think if this is a good quality or not .&lt;br /&gt;at the beginning i was so bumped about it  because the color does not show on my hair even if i rub it sooo hard i can barely see it and i tried with small curl of hair . the next day i tried again and finally i see the difference ,it was better the the day before.&lt;br /&gt;i was expecting better results</li>
    <li> I really like how these pastels apply to my hair. They were smaller then I thought, but I think that worked better because it gave me more control to select small sections of hair. I especially loved the teal, pink, and purples, they worked really well in my hair! When I run out, I&#x27;m sure I will buy more again.</li>
    <li> This hair chalk is awesome. It applies easy and stays in longer then regular hair chalk bought at the store.</li>
    <li> I was counting on this product, took a chance and it failed me. I have light blonde hair and I can&#x27;t get it to even work. Gets all over my hands but never my hair no matter what guides on the hair chalk I follow it never works.</li>
    <li> My son and daughter love all the different colors. It is easy to apply even they can do it their selves. I like it because it washes out easy!</li>
    <li> My daughter saw a similar product at Urban Outfitters so I scanned Amazon for a better price and found this hair chalk. It is excellent! Great fun, easy to use and easy to wash out. She and her friends (11-13 year olds) love it! One of her favorite Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> However, they can also be used for the hair,but it is evident they were not manufactured with such purpose in mind.</li>
    <li> Sent it back.  Didn&#x27;t show up on my daughters hair, which is dirty blonde. Also, a lot of them arrived broken, and upon use, even more broke very easily.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product.when it came it doesn&#x27;t even say masters pastel. It&#x27;s just. A white box.i also got something else in it and I thought it wasn&#x27;t even my order.when I tried to use it,it got all over my bathroom and my hair started getting knots in it.i can barely see the color in my hair. I would not recommend this product and I would like my money back. Does anyone know if I can? Thanks😕</li>
    <li> This colored the hair but was messy and came off on the hands really bad.  She had to put on plastic gloves to use..</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t arrive in the packaging pictured. needless to say it&#x27;s like i have a bunch of chalk sitting around with not packaging for it to be stored in.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work too well with hair.</li>
    <li> These are for art. Even with extreme friction, all I got was damaged hair. No color.</li>
    <li> Packaging needs to be better; more directions, etc.  Good variety in colors, though.</li>
    <li> It is vary easy to use and I love wearing it in my hair. I would recommend this item to any one who loves to have fun!!</li>
