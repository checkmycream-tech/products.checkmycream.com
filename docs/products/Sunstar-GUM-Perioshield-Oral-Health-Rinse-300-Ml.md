### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It will affect your taste for up to an hour after each rinse, so the best time to use it is after meals instead of</li>
      <li>/&gt;Granted it has its shortcomings, it&#x27;s not the greatest tasting rinse in the world</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great!</li>
      <li>I have seen excellent results in their cases and will continue to recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Wonderful, nothing else ever worked.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Great stuff !  </li>
      <li>She recommended this product to me, and it is the best product for plaque prevention I have used.  </li>
      <li>This product seemed like a great solution.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that my hygienist recommended for my gums.  </li>
      <li>product might be great for some people, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
      <li>Dentist encouraged me to keep using perioshield because it has greatly improved my gum health.</li>
      <li>and I always had great teeth</li>
      <li>Have noticed my tooth staining greatly diminished since using this product.</li>
      <li>My hygienist was thrilled, saying my teeth and gums looked the best they ever had.  </li>
      <li>think it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>According to the label it&#x27;s also good for bleeding gums, but I have not had an opportunity to verify that claim.</li>
      <li>good product I wish they will made toothpaste in the futur</li>
      <li>a found a good deal here.  </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll just keep on using my aloe vera mouthwash and peppermint oil for after brushing (with a sonicare which I love!)</li>
      <li>It does not kill the bacteria but prevents it from attaching to plaque and the tooth and gum surfaces... effectively stopping the bacteria from having a place to grow.  </li>
      <li>And to be honest, there is a chemical taste, so do not expect miracles.</li>
      <li>This is a really great product to keep your mouth clean and free of bacteria.  </li>
      <li>This worked best for me, much better than diluting it, and no other product has worked as well.</li>
      <li>In the trials if was found to be as or more effective than a chlorhexidine gluconate rinse which is a strong antibacterial mouth</li>
      <li>I love - aside from the plaque reduction</li>
      <li>and I may not be able to purchase it.</li>
      <li>I can attest that it actually prevents plaque build-up, and that makes this a great preventive tool for good hygiene and why I believe that it&#x27;s a five star product.</li>
      <li>Yes, there is a numbing sensation but more than that, it&#x27;s burning the heck out of my tongue.</li>
      <li>Sure, it numbed my tongue.  </li>
      <li>if you are bothered by those types of things but for bleeding gums and overall gum health it is a great product!!</li>
      <li>The mint flavor tends to be overwhelming at times but you get used to it.</li>
      <li>The taste takes some getting used to, and if you swish it for more than the recommended time, you&#x27;ll notice the effect on your tongue for a while.</li>
      <li>Minimal plaque, no bleeding gums anymore, yet no blisters or other nastiness, win, win, win!  </li>
      <li>but I have one of those mouths that easily grow a lot of plaque, so I have to get my teeth done often.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful product that works and because it works its worth the minor side effects.</li>
      <li>I have advanced periodontal disease and with 2 days my gums have stopped bleeding all together.</li>
      <li>and I was happy to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem: This product threw my salivary glands into massive overdrive.</li>
      <li>I returned to the dentist 3 weeks later and my gums were in great condition.</li>
      <li>I really won&#x27;t know how effective this product is until I have a dental check up.  </li>
      <li>I use it myself and my teeth feel smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>All in all well worth the money!</li>
      <li>but in a unique way.  </li>
      <li>- is it leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so clean when I use this every morning.</li>
      <li>and my mouth feels clean.  </li>
      <li>It is likely the most effective mouth rinse I have tried for fighting bacteria and plaque.  </li>
      <li>I am now experimenting with using Perioshield evenings only to see of the effect is nearly as good.  </li>
      <li>Since using it I have noticed a significant reduction in plaque - and to me that makes it worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I swished quickly and spit it out THEN rinsed it out of my mouth so the flavor was almost tolerable...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pregnant, so</li>
      <li>It does really work and it&#x27;s a strong stuff.</li>
      <li>I really wish this product, along with additional Gum products like Rincinol, were widely available in drug and grocery stores.</li>
      <li>Use it as for your own use as part of your daily mouthwash and gum protecion</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price of admission</li>
      <li>kind of the opposite of what you want a mouthwash to do for you).  </li>
      <li>kind of gross taste.  </li>
      <li>but it is supposed to be good for my oral health, the taste isn&#x27;t bad, and I got it quickly at a reasonable price, so that was great.</li>
      <li>just used it for the first time.</li>
      <li>It works very well and the bleeding has stopped!</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
      <li>After my last cleaning I decided to be a lot more proactive regarding dental hygiene, which led me to this rinse.</li>
      <li>I may try it again, but I have to get up the nerve first...</li>
      <li>Great product at least for me, works as described.</li>
      <li>but it is excellent for getting through the day with minimal fuzzy icky feeling... .  </li>
      <li>rinse only available by prescription...</li>
      <li>I was doing the swallowing motion so much that I had pain in my jaw and teeth (</li>
      <li>I imagine it&#x27;s not going to work very well</li>
      <li>This and the PerioBalance lozenges were recommended to me by my dental hygienist and really seem to work.</li>
      <li>No bleeding when flossing after using this once in the morning and once in the evening for two weeks straight.</li>
      <li>the REAL solution for your tartar control.</li>
      <li>Cleanings are much easier and quicker now.</li>
      <li>Didnt really bleed in the Morning...</li>
      <li>It really kills the germs and eliminates plaque....</li>
      <li>definitely* made a significant difference to my gums which don&#x27;t bleed nearly as much now.  </li>
      <li>would love to hear other reviews.  </li>
      <li>A thirty second swish making sure it thoroughly gets between all of your teeth is all it takes (at first the half minute seemed like forever, but you quickly get used to that.)</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised that while washing it didn&#x27;t really taste of much!  </li>
      <li>PerioShield... is a new product that really works well...</li>
      <li>This rinse has a fresh clean, dry taste, which I prefer over the sweet sticky taste of other rinses.</li>
      <li>I can live with that small downside considering just how effective this has been for me.</li>
      <li>I have asked my patients if they experienced any unpleasant affects after use and they stated no unpleasant issues.</li>
      <li>but I cannot find it for sale where I live.  </li>
      <li>So far, my only complaints are, I wish it came in a larger bottle and that I only seem to be able to obtain it on line.</li>
      <li>Hard to say I Love this</li>
      <li>/&gt;By the way, my mouth and tongue have gone completely numb and this also doesn&#x27;t make me a happy camper.</li>
      <li>It came out of the bottle clear.</li>
      <li>I will also add that I see no staining of the enamel, which is terrific since there are some products on the market targeted at this very issue that cause staining.</li>
      <li>So far, I like it.</li>
      <li>However, it could be that it&#x27;s a professional rinse</li>
      <li>It has a mild taste similar to very watered down Listerine maybe twenty to one.  </li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to rinse daily as my dentist recommended without losing small sheets of skin off the inside of my mouth and lips and getting blisters everywhere.  </li>
      <li>I am a registered dental hygienist and have recommended this rinse to several patients that build plaque easily and have trouble removing it mechanically.</li>
      <li>It should only last about two days if you&#x27;re using the product consistently according to our rep though we have varying results with the numbness ceasing as directed and also continuing daily.</li>
      <li>Most mouthwashes I have to have a watered down half dose</li>
      <li>Not more than five seconds after swallowing, my mouth was full of saliva again.</li>
      <li>A few days after stopping use of this product, I am more or less back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a problem with bleeding gums all my adult life;  this stopped after using this product for two days; it comes back if I stop using it, no matter that I floss daily.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have noticed my tooth staining greatly diminished since using this product. Kudos!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dental hygienist &amp; could only find it online!</li>
    <li> No bleeding when flossing after using this once in the morning and once in the evening for two weeks straight. I bought a second bottle and will continue using this product. Finally something that actually works for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I had a deep cleaning and after using Perio Shield for 2 months,  my dental pockets which wer 8 and 9 returned back to 4 and 5. Anyone with periodental problem shoud use this product . It saved me $10,000.00 in gum surgery.</li>
    <li> After ten years of recommending another product our office recently switched to suggesting Perioshield to our patients.&lt;br /&gt;So long as we have patient compliance the results have been outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;Granted it has its shortcomings, it&#x27;s not the greatest tasting rinse in the world then again if you can tolerate Listerine this should be no problem and the numbness concerning the tongue is an odd side effect. It should only last about two days if you&#x27;re using the product consistently according to our rep though we have varying results with the numbness ceasing as directed and also continuing daily. It&#x27;s a 50/50 split.&lt;br /&gt;That said what the product does is create a protective layer over the tooth and cervical area long enough to inhibit plaque formation. It&#x27;s worth the price of admission but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with gingival bleeding ( do your gums bleed when you brush or floss?) is a candidate.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely for adults only- kids and teens are going to hate the taste.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful product that works and because it works its worth the minor side effects. BTW no rinsing for 30 minutes afterwards!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and tastes as advertised.  Will hold final evaluation until I visit my periodontist next month.  Will use conscientiously between now and then!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by several people. Since my mouth is practically a tartar factory, I decided to give it a try. Over the years I&#x27;ve gravitated back and froth between various Crest and Listerine products and I was happy to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem: This product threw my salivary glands into massive overdrive. I was having to swallow all day long. Not more than five seconds after swallowing, my mouth was full of saliva again. I was doing the swallowing motion so much that I had pain in my jaw and teeth (kind of the opposite of what you want a mouthwash to do for you).  Also, my lips were chapped (I mean really chapped). This is the only thing that I could trace this phenomenon back to. A few days after stopping use of this product, I am more or less back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product might be great for some people, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Great stuff !  Im 46 and I always had great teeth (only 1 cavity),,,,past couple months gums were bleeding when I brushed at night..Didnt really bleed in the Morning...Anyway been using this 2x a day and the bleeding has essentially stopped!! Minor numbing feeling for about and hour afterwards if you are bothered by those types of things but for bleeding gums and overall gum health it is a great product!!</li>
    <li> It really kills the germs and eliminates plaque....it does make your tongue a bit numb, but not for long...similar to Listerene. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I really won&#x27;t know how effective this product is until I have a dental check up.  The taste is a bit bitter but not as bad as some rinses I have used. I use this in the morning and the perio-gum lozenges at night so hope one or both will make a difference in the health of my gums.</li>
    <li> While I haven&#x27;t been to my dentist yet for official results, I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;noticed a difference since I&#x27;ve used this perio rinse and plan&lt;br /&gt;to keep using it to help keep my gums healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews mention a bad taste as well as some temporary&lt;br /&gt;tongue numbness.  I don&#x27;t find the taste to be awful, and, while&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve felt a bit of temporary numbness, it is extremely minimal.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not Listerine, after all; it&#x27;s a specialized perio rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have had problems with periodontal disease, as I have&lt;br /&gt;for years (been through two scaling/root planings), I&#x27;d definitely&lt;br /&gt;recommend trying this rinse.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my dentist after I had some gum deterioration happening. I used it every morning and before bed for several weeks after undergoing laser therapy on my gums. I returned to the dentist 3 weeks later and my gums were in great condition. I have continued to use this product to insure no future problems. This only drawback is that it does cause a numbing sensation on the tongue but I rinse my tongue after each application and this appears to solve that.</li>
    <li> wake up with no smelly mouthi think it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> I have advanced periodontal disease and with 2 days my gums have stopped bleeding all together. It tastes like gold listerene. It does numb your mouth mildly for about 20-30 minutes which is a plus if you have a painful gum disease! All in all well worth the money!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product to me but I cannot find it for sale where I live.  So I checked online a found a good deal here.  The taste takes some getting used to, and if you swish it for more than the recommended time, you&#x27;ll notice the effect on your tongue for a while.</li>
    <li> After my last cleaning I decided to be a lot more proactive regarding dental hygiene, which led me to this rinse. Since using it I have noticed a significant reduction in plaque - and to me that makes it worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per directions I use it in the morning and evening after brushing. A thirty second swish making sure it thoroughly gets between all of your teeth is all it takes (at first the half minute seemed like forever, but you quickly get used to that.) It will affect your taste for up to an hour after each rinse, so the best time to use it is after meals instead of before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love - aside from the plaque reduction - is it leaves your mouth feeling clean. And to be honest, there is a chemical taste, so do not expect miracles. I can live with that small downside considering just how effective this has been for me. According to the label it&#x27;s also good for bleeding gums, but I have not had an opportunity to verify that claim. I can attest that it actually prevents plaque build-up, and that makes this a great preventive tool for good hygiene and why I believe that it&#x27;s a five star product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I recommend it. Use it as for your own use as part of your daily mouthwash and gum protecion</li>
    <li> I purchased this rinse because I was on an aspirin regimen before I had some surgery. I had to take a full-strength aspirin every day which soon enough caused my gums to start bleeding really badly. I&#x27;ve had trouble getting them back to normal. My orthodontist gave me a rinse that was supposed to help my gums heal. When I ran out, I ordered the Sunstar GUM Periodshield rinse. It looked like it was a blue color, the same that the orthodontist had given me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used it for the first time. It came out of the bottle clear. The box said there would be some numbing sensation that would go away after a few days. I WILL NOT be using this rinse again. Yes, there is a numbing sensation but more than that, it&#x27;s burning the heck out of my tongue. You&#x27;re not supposed to rinse with water after you use this stuff, but I&#x27;ve been putting water on my tongue for ten minutes and it&#x27;s still burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just going to call my orthodontist tomorrow and find out what they use. If I can purchase it from Amazon or somewhere else, I will do that. However, it could be that it&#x27;s a professional rinse and I may not be able to purchase it. Regardless, I will not buy this rinse again and I suggest NO ONE buy it. It&#x27;s awful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my mouth and tongue have gone completely numb and this also doesn&#x27;t make me a happy camper.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. I&#x27;ve had a problem with bleeding gums all my adult life;  this stopped after using this product for two days; it comes back if I stop using it, no matter that I floss daily.  Wonderful, nothing else ever worked.</li>
    <li> Most mouthwashes I have to have a watered down half dose and I still end up getting overwhelmed by the taste and have to spit it out half way through.  After a few days of trying I usually just give up and stop using them altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this one would be even worse from all the reviews about the mouth numbness, but my gums were bleeding something fierce so I gave it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised that while washing it didn&#x27;t really taste of much!  Only after you spit it out does the mintiness and numbness hit you, but at that point it&#x27;s rather nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day before bed, but it has *definitely* made a significant difference to my gums which don&#x27;t bleed nearly as much now.  They still do on occasion, but I have periodontitis (the one after gingivitis) and I&#x27;m pregnant, so it&#x27;s got its work cut out for it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that my hygienist recommended for my gums.  It works very well and the bleeding has stopped!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the results. The mint flavor tends to be overwhelming at times but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so clean when I use this every morning. I am anxious to see what my dental hygenist says about my teeth.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supossed to do.</li>
    <li> PerioShield... is a new product that really works well... but in a unique way.  It is likely the most effective mouth rinse I have tried for fighting bacteria and plaque.  It does not kill the bacteria but prevents it from attaching to plaque and the tooth and gum surfaces... effectively stopping the bacteria from having a place to grow.  I would suggest its use with an anti-bacterial rinse but it is excellent for getting through the day with minimal fuzzy icky feeling... .  It has a mild taste similar to very watered down Listerine maybe twenty to one.  It does numb the tongue and the lips slightly for a few minutes to 1/2 hour after use... this effect becomes less noticeable with continued use... but it does also make sensitive areas less so too.  In the trials if was found to be as or more effective than a chlorhexidine gluconate rinse which is a strong antibacterial mouth rinse only available by prescription... and it does not have the teeth staining effect that clorohexidine has when used after drinking coffee, tea or a cola product.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Has the equivalent of lye in it.</li>
    <li> the REAL solution for your tartar control. OUTSTADING! a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have terrible teeth and have to have the tartar scraped off every four months. After a few days of using period shield I already see a difference. My teeth have simply had very little tartar build up since rinsing with this product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who is dealing with periodontal disease.  This and the PerioBalance lozenges were recommended to me by my dental hygienist and really seem to work.</li>
    <li> I am a registered dental hygienist and have recommended this rinse to several patients that build plaque easily and have trouble removing it mechanically. A few of these patients are periodontal patients while some are not. I have seen excellent results in their cases and will continue to recommend this product. I have asked my patients if they experienced any unpleasant affects after use and they stated no unpleasant issues. I will also add that I see no staining of the enamel, which is terrific since there are some products on the market targeted at this very issue that cause staining. I really wish this product, along with additional Gum products like Rincinol, were widely available in drug and grocery stores. People do not like running around all over town to find recommended items.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes that I could avoid having to have my teeth cleaned every 3 or 4 months (insurance only covers twice a year).  I floss and do everything I&#x27;m supposed to...but I have one of those mouths that easily grow a lot of plaque, so I have to get my teeth done often.  This product seemed like a great solution.  I&#x27;ve only tried it once.  It numbed my tongue for hours...even after rinsing with water!!  I may try it again, but I have to get up the nerve first...didn&#x27;t like that numb tongue at all! It does have a dry, vaguely mint taste.  NOT very pleasant, actually...kind of gross taste.  But I swished quickly and spit it out THEN rinsed it out of my mouth so the flavor was almost tolerable...but I STILL got a numb tongue...even after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...there it sits on the bathroom counter waiting for me to get the nerve to try it a second time.  I may try dipping my toothbrush in it and just going over my teeth (so it doesn&#x27;t get on my tongue).  Or maybe a Q-tip.  I imagine it&#x27;s not going to work very well if I don&#x27;t use it:-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to hear other reviews.  There was only one review on Amazon when I bought it and he didn&#x27;t mention the numb tongue thing...which is a big surprise since it&#x27;s VERY obvious when you use the product!!</li>
    <li> Excessive plaque buildup runs in my family.  I see my dental hygienist a minimum of every four months.  She recommended this product to me, and it is the best product for plaque prevention I have used.  The directions say to use morning and evening, which I did until my next dental appointment.  My hygienist was thrilled, saying my teeth and gums looked the best they ever had.  I am now experimenting with using Perioshield evenings only to see of the effect is nearly as good.  I am trying this due to cost of product and it is very &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;, giving a numb feeling to the mouth for about a half hour after use.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product to keep your mouth clean and free of bacteria.  I won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to my by my dentist.  Have been using it daily for  the last couple of weeks and my mouth feels clean.  This product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I am allergic/sensitive to half the things on Earth so I wasn&#x27;t able to rinse daily as my dentist recommended without losing small sheets of skin off the inside of my mouth and lips and getting blisters everywhere.  Instead, I wet my toothbrush with it and brush as normal (using Tom&#x27;s of Maine paste) two or three times a week and thoroughly rinse afterwards.  Minimal plaque, no bleeding gums anymore, yet no blisters or other nastiness, win, win, win!  Yes, still have the tingly tongue but it&#x27;s gone in half an hour.  This worked best for me, much better than diluting it, and no other product has worked as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Recommend it to anyone trying to shore up oral protecton to the highest level.</li>
    <li> I can only purchase this now thru Amazon, none of my local stores carry this anymore. My dentist says my overall oral health has improved since I started using this. I won&#x27;t be without it, even though it is a bit pricey but it does save me from more expensive dental work down the road. Great product at least for me, works as described.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he noticed immediate improvement.  I use it myself and my teeth feel smooth and clean.  Use only a small amount as that is all that is necessary.  Don&#x27;t fill the measuring cup that comes with it.  Fill the cup only to the lowest line on the cup and the bottle will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a mouth wash.  It is a &amp;#34;swish and spit&amp;#34;.  Thirty seconds of swishing.</li>
    <li> good product I wish they will made toothpaste in the futur</li>
    <li> This is perhaps an unfair review because I only used this product two times.  Sure, it numbed my tongue.  I thought I would tough it out.  But after using it before bedtime, the next morning I woke with a small blister under my tongue.  Am I allergic or hypersensitive?  I don&#x27;t know, but I won&#x27;t use it again.  I think I&#x27;ll just keep on using my aloe vera mouthwash and peppermint oil for after brushing (with a sonicare which I love!)</li>
    <li> Dentist encouraged me to keep using perioshield because it has greatly improved my gum health. Everything is stable now. Cleanings are much easier and quicker now.</li>
    <li> I have battled bad gums for a while, within 30 days of using this product my mouth is doing so much better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away one star for how small the bottle is</li>
    <li> Hard to say I Love this but it is supposed to be good for my oral health, the taste isn&#x27;t bad, and I got it quickly at a reasonable price, so that was great.</li>
    <li> It does really work and it&#x27;s a strong stuff. No kidding. Use it as needed only.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on a number of reviews and a clinical study.So far, I like it. This rinse has a fresh clean, dry taste, which I prefer over the sweet sticky taste of other rinses. So far, my only complaints are, I wish it came in a larger bottle and that I only seem to be able to obtain it on line. Otherwise, I would recomend this product...we will see how I do at my next cleaning!</li>
