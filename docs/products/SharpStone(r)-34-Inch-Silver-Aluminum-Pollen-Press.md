### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Does the job perfectly.</li>
      <li>Awesome, awesome, awesome.</li>
      <li>works perfect every time</li>
      <li>Incredible buy at an incredible price.</li>
      <li>Real nice press.</li>
      <li>Great deal</li>
      <li>Threaded caps scoring has a good grip as well.</li>
      <li>Not because of the brand, sharpstones always done good by me.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice tool for compressing pollen .</li>
      <li>works ok.</li>
      <li>knurled portion could be better for tightening.</li>
      <li>Much better than the rubberized plastic press plate versions.</li>
      <li>For the price I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>Works fine, use no-stick cook spray for better results</li>
      <li>All and all fine tool .</li>
      <li>Works great,  remember to heat up after you put in the Kief melts into a nice little hash tablet.</li>
      <li>nicely made and works very well</li>
      <li>After letting the press sit under a heat source for two hours, while tightening every 15min or so, I ended up with a beautiful golden-brown end-product: a puck slightly thicker than the Smarties candies.</li>
      <li>The dowels are metal, not black like in the picture, which are actually better in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Comes with metal not rubber things that go inside which are super soft steel which bends easy n</li>
      <li>and it seems very strong and durable as long as care is taken when handling the equipment.</li>
      <li>After a little ingenuity with a thumbtack and a razorblade it was good to go, but in the process I managed to cut the palm of my hand on one of the press&#x27; threads.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Purely because 85% of these types of presses suck, including probably 75% of the t bar presses as well.</li>
      <li>I could see this working if I had not pressed it as much.</li>
      <li>I have not had a chance to really rate this yet</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>It is made very well, strong and heavy.</li>
      <li>Live and learn, though, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very lightweight and hard, but easy to scratch or create grooves on the surface</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s relatively small, though, I only felt comfortable putting 0.50g of &amp;#34;pollen&amp;#34; into it the first</li>
      <li>but so far it is what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>I was quite surprised at the quality of this press.</li>

    <li> Pressed kief and everything got stuck seized up. Had to beat the crap out of the ends and broke the unit. I did load a bunch in it and pressed it REALLY hard. I could see this working if I had not pressed it as much.</li>
    <li> works perfect every time</li>
    <li> Incredible buy at an incredible price. Does the job perfectly. Convenient size. Lightweight.</li>
    <li> Not sure about authenticity, although the construction of this seems solid.The dowels are metal, not black like in the picture, which are actually better in my opinion. For the price I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and it does everything promised. Ive had it for a couple months now and it&#x27;s never gotten stuck. Woukd definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I received my item and I was expecting the inside compressing parts to be plastic, but to my surprise they feel like solid aluminum cylinders.  Very lightweight and hard, but easy to scratch or create grooves on the surface which would make getting the cylinders in and out very difficult since there is no space for the cylinders to move when inserted and the cylinders are pristine.  Haven&#x27;t had enough pollen to press but I&#x27;ve been playing with it for over 2 weeks and it seems very strong and durable as long as care is taken when handling the equipment.</li>
    <li> Comes with metal not rubber things that go inside which are super soft steel which bends easy n gets stuck</li>
    <li> Works great,  remember to heat up after you put in the Kief melts into a nice little hash tablet. 😎</li>
    <li> This is a really nice tool for compressing pollen . It can get stuck after a few uses and the metal is soft and will bend if hammered destroying the press. So if u get one of these if it gets jammed dint use a hammer to try to break it apart or it destroys it. All and all fine tool . Just not to durable</li>
    <li> Awesome, awesome, awesome. Exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s relatively small, though, I only felt comfortable putting 0.50g of &amp;#34;pollen&amp;#34; into it the first go-&#x27;round. After letting the press sit under a heat source for two hours, while tightening every 15min or so, I ended up with a beautiful golden-brown end-product: a puck slightly thicker than the Smarties candies. The puck was difficult to remove from the press, however, and then it was difficult to separate from the metal dowels. After a little ingenuity with a thumbtack and a razorblade it was good to go, but in the process I managed to cut the palm of my hand on one of the press&#x27; threads. Live and learn, though, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5, would recommend</li>
    <li> nicely made and works very well</li>
    <li> works ok. knurled portion could be better for tightening.</li>
    <li> Real nice press. Great deal</li>
    <li> Used a variety of these style presses over the years but this sharpstone is the smoothest. Much better than the rubberized plastic press plate versions. Threaded caps scoring has a good grip as well. None the less from past experience do not use metal to tighten or try to force the press plates down. Any chips, gouges, or deep scrapes could keep the plates from ever functioning again and cause the press to seize. I was quite surprised at the quality of this press. Not because of the brand, sharpstones always done good by me. Purely because 85% of these types of presses suck, including probably 75% of the t bar presses as well. But for under 15$ it&#x27;s dank!</li>
    <li> Works fine, use no-stick cook spray for better results</li>
    <li> I have not had a chance to really rate this yet but so far it is what I wanted.  It is made very well, strong and heavy.</li>
    <li> Used this to create echinacea pills. It&#x27;s solid enough to not worry about stripping the threads and tight enough that it creates a solid pellet without  any slop.</li>
