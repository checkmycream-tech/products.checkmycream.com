      <li>I thought this was a good product for him.</li>
      <li>Perviously, no customer service rep could offer a good reason why I was having these problems</li>
      <li>It was about 10% effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The newer unit works much better, but the indicator still is not that good.</li>

      <li>I wish I could post a photo of the ad because there are more than one and</li>
      <li>Most people probably skip out because they just don&#x27;t have the time.</li>
      <li>may edit this review in 6 months to advise if there are even more hairs that have disappeared.</li>
      <li>I learned that a warm feeling means you&#x27;re doing it right.  </li>
      <li>I was very dissappointed in the fact I honestly was looking forward to a better way of hair removal, than shaving.</li>
      <li>I think it is overpriced and not as easy to use as advertised.</li>
      <li>The seller said &amp;#34;its easy, you&#x27;ll figure it out&amp;#34;..... well, if I&#x27;m using a product like this, I&#x27;d rather have instructions than go through &amp;#34;trial &amp; error&amp;#34; techniques.  </li>
      <li>The smell of burning hair is strong.  </li>
      <li>Plus, just for giggles, I tried it on fine hair and it didn&#x27;t even work....</li>

      <li>We returned it for full credit.</li>

      <li>First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing).</li>
      <li>VERY DECEPTIVE!!  </li>
      <li>Was it worth it?</li>
      <li>I originally was going too fast, and not holding the tool at a 90 degree angle.</li>
      <li>It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway.</li>
      <li>So far it is working just fine.  </li>
      <li>I anticipated an end to shaving the many new imperfections in my new face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One of the heads broke fast &amp; I am trying to get a hold of someone to replace it!</li>
      <li>but the first payment was $104.  </li>
      <li>VERY DISSAPOINTED!</li>
      <li>I am very dissatisfied with the No!No! 8800.</li>
      <li>Basically, the product is a hot wire (electrical wire) and trying to &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the hair off.</li>
      <li>he was the first one that identified that there was an issue with the unit itself.</li>
      <li>Ok, it works by hitting the hair with a red hot metal strip.</li>
      <li>The NoNo company refunded MOST of my money but not the total amount.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The first one I received malfunctioned and would use up the large thermicon tips within two weeks.</li>
      <li>It would remove (lightly burn off) very this, short, fine hair but only went over other hairs with no results.&lt;br /&gt;I would not reccomend this device to anyone seeking a good hair removal system.</li>
      <li>It is quite pricey, so I am sure that even with a significant number of returns, they still profit heavily from those who never get around to mailing it</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use the No No cream because I wanted to see how the unit works on its own with using a cream that slows down the hair growth, making you think it works.</li>
      <li>It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Does not seem to do much of anything.  </li>
      <li>Dosent really work, its a scam</li>
      <li>I purchased this product to see if it would really work.  </li>
      <li>I understand it is suppose to remove the hair over a period of time however, for the amount of money I spent on this device, it should have shown more results than it did.</li>
      <li>He knows what he wants and kept seeing the commercials, kept asking when I&#x27;d get it.  </li>
      <li>I shouldn&#x27;t be going through tips so fast.</li>
      <li>It removes hair in very small patches at best and other areas</li>
      <li>bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial.</li>
      <li>I even went over the area more than they said, with no success.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there is some type of \\&quot;restock\\&quot; fee, but it&#x27;s not worth the fight.  </li>
      <li>When I spoke to this particular customer service rep.</li>
      <li>When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming.</li>
      <li>They said perhaps mine was defective, and offered me a new one.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t even begin to live up to the hype.</li>
      <li>I called back exactly in 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial.</li>
      <li>I am not sure that this explanation is actually plausible (which is why I tried</li>
      <li>I believe mine might have been defective because it surely didn&#x27;t cut hair like advertised, it also would keep going off, and when it was on it hardly did anything</li>

      <li>This is NOT TRUE even though the photo looks like you get it all for a \\&quot;special offer\\&quot; of $100.  </li>
      <li>Item was exactly what I expected and was delivered timely.</li>
      <li>Unit seems to be working as the blue light comes on and a few hairs are removed but....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d really think if the instruction manual front page can be printed in English, the box printed in English, the instructions can be too.  </li>
      <li>and it grows back just as thick as it was originally!  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s not incompetent, just forgetful and so needs some help.  </li>
      <li>I use the No No on my chest, stomach, shoulders, back (as far as I can reach), under side of my arms and upper legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Apparently this is supposed to work by burning the hair repeatedly so it doesn&#x27;t grow back.  </li>
      <li>I am an adult male with considerable chest hair and was excited about having a device that would save me the time of shaving several times a week and remove my chest hair in a manner that would slow down its return.  </li>

<li> I am an adult male with considerable chest hair and was excited about having a device that would save me the time of shaving several times a week and remove my chest hair in a manner that would slow down its return.  </li>
<li> the one I saw has the device and all the accessories behind a card that says \\&quot;Special Offer $100\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I know I need to be patient to experience long lasting results.  </li>
<li> I bought this product factory direct, little did I know, you could have gotten these from various places.  </li>
<li> and I found they seemed to last much, much longer; at least two months.</li>
<li> And so, using it for 20 minutes at a time while watching tv about 3-4 times per week, I went over my shoulders and back where I could reach and low and behold, in a little over a week, I had bare skin where wirey hair had been growing.  </li>
<li> The &amp;#34;No no&amp;#34; not only wouldn&#x27;t remove a single hair, but wouldn&#x27;t even function, stalling upon every strand of hair it encountered.  </li>
<li> Hard to use, did no fire every time, needs to be use at a certain speed and angle&lt;</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve spent over a thousand on professional electrolysis for my shoulder and back region with less results than I have had with no</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on course body hair for men, it will work but takes a long time.</li>
<li> Next, since in the instructional DVD a woman was seen removing her arm hair, I attempted to test it on my arm; it removed NOT ONE SINGLE STRAND OF HAIR!!  </li>
<li> Also, I was disappointed that when I received the additional tips it was 2 SMALL ones and 2 LARGE ones and even though the first larger one I used didn&#x27;t wear out as fast as with the pervious unit, it still wore out in about a</li>
<li> I actually observed two other returns while I was waiting to have mine</li>
<li> My biggest complaint is that it arrived and while the boxes and the cover of the manual was in English, the entire manual was in Japanese as was the cd.  </li>
<li> Minimally effective; bought it to remove difficult to shave facial hair just below the chin and above the neck and it was utterly useless.</li>
<li> After 5 weeks of DAILY use, I so no significant difference between the 2 sides of my chest.&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews and was surprised.  </li>
<li> followed the instructions to the letter, and notice no real results.  </li>
<li> I was assured that after a few weeks of regular use, I would see some results.  </li>
<li> I did half of my chest daily with this product, the other half was shaved.  </li>
<li> I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result.</li>
<li> I used it daily over the two week period with very little results.</li>
<li> The video is no help, its not in other languages either.  </li>
<li> so now it sits at the bottom of a box, along with lots of other nick-nacks.&lt;br</li>
<li> I am disappointment, but not shocked either.</li>
<li> I attempted to remove a small portion of my chest hair that was between shavings and only 1/8&amp;#34; in length.  </li>
<li> I was given a &amp;#34;No no&amp;#34;8800 Hair Removal Device for Men for Christmas and after carefully reading the instructions and watching the accompanying instructional DVD, I followed the directions TO THE LETTER!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I say &amp;#34;NO NO&amp;#34; to this product. Did not work well at all. We returned it for full credit.</li>
    <li> It does not remove hair as advertised. Will wear you out trying to see results.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised!  I have been using it as recommended and all it does is singe the hair and it grows back just as thick as it was originally!  VERY DISSAPOINTED!</li>
    <li> Item was exactly what I expected and was delivered timely. I had research item and was looking for the best value. I think it is overpriced and not as easy to use as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product was an unsatisfactory purchase, doesn&#x27;t do what it is advertised to do.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this product, it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
    <li> Minimally effective; bought it to remove difficult to shave facial hair just below the chin and above the neck and it was utterly useless.</li>
    <li> This product did not perform at all as advertised. I would go over the hair on my chest and arms multiple times and then try to remove it with the pad supplied. It was about 10% effective. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I am sticking with the product but for now I am not really impressed with it, not sure that it works. But i will give it some time to see if there be results</li>
    <li> Does not seem to do much of anything.  No matter how many passes I make the hair remains.  Unit seems to be working as the blue light comes on and a few hairs are removed but....</li>
    <li> This item met all my expectations and then some. It does the job it was designed to do. Great item!</li>
    <li> No directions in English. I am using it without any instructions, Could use a link to get a better understanding</li>
    <li> I was given a &amp;#34;No no&amp;#34;8800 Hair Removal Device for Men for Christmas and after carefully reading the instructions and watching the accompanying instructional DVD, I followed the directions TO THE LETTER!  I am an adult male with considerable chest hair and was excited about having a device that would save me the time of shaving several times a week and remove my chest hair in a manner that would slow down its return.  I attempted to remove a small portion of my chest hair that was between shavings and only 1/8&amp;#34; in length.  The &amp;#34;No no&amp;#34; not only wouldn&#x27;t remove a single hair, but wouldn&#x27;t even function, stalling upon every strand of hair it encountered.  I tried again and again, rereading the instructions and even going online to their site for additional help, but nothing I did worked.  Next, since in the instructional DVD a woman was seen removing her arm hair, I attempted to test it on my arm; it removed NOT ONE SINGLE STRAND OF HAIR!!  The &amp;#34;No no&amp;#34; ranks as the single most egregious &amp;#34;rip-off&amp;#34; that I have ever encountered.  That they have the audacity to charge more than $300 for this worthless piece of junk ought to violate some criminal statute!</li>
    <li> I ordered a NoNo through a radio offer advertisment.  MISTAKE!!  The add talks about an EXCLUSIVE offer of $100 discount card.  The impression is that the radio deal was $100 for the price of the device.  This is NOT TRUE even though the photo looks like you get it all for a \\&quot;special offer\\&quot; of $100.  VERY DECEPTIVE!!  The radio station should be ashamed of themselves.  I wish I could post a photo of the ad because there are more than one and the one I saw has the device and all the accessories behind a card that says \\&quot;Special Offer $100\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately I called to cancel my order.  I was told to call back in an hour.  I called back and I was told to call back in 24 hours.  I called back exactly in 24 hours.  I was told SORRY ITS ALREADY ON THE WAY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m complaining to the Texas AG&#x27;s office about this company.  I suggest anyone else go to their states Consumer Protection agency to make their complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not usually do bad reviews...but in my opinion this business seems shady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-06-2013 UPDATE:  I received the NoNo yesterday.  The package arrived is *TERRIBLE* condition!!  It is an old worn box, not recently torn like in a bad shipment, but WORN OUT!  Then, it was taped up with scotch tape!!  I requested a return and they gave me a \\&quot;RMA\\&quot; number...we&#x27;ll see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01-24-2013 UPDATE:  I also called my credit card to ensure no more auto withdraws and there were none.  The NoNo company refunded MOST of my money but not the total amount.  I received back $89 but the first payment was $104.  I&#x27;m sure there is some type of \\&quot;restock\\&quot; fee, but it&#x27;s not worth the fight.  What I did when I got to the post office was just return the box to them as \\&quot;refused\\&quot;.  Even the postman said, \\&quot;but you already opened it.\\&quot;  I assured him that -I- did NOT open the box that and it arrived in this poor condition to my mailbox.</li>
    <li> So far it is working just fine.  I know I need to be patient to experience long lasting results.  My biggest complaint is that it arrived and while the boxes and the cover of the manual was in English, the entire manual was in Japanese as was the cd.  The information on amazon should have indicated that information was not in English - would have helped me with my purchasing decision.</li>
    <li> I ordered the No No around the end of May 2013. I had been using it since the beginning of June 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a guy&#x27;s prospective, I feel that the No No is doing its job. I was waxing my chest for years before using the No No, but I couldn&#x27;t take the in grown-hairs any longer and that is why I ordered it. I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews and I understand why it received them. It takes about 6 months to see good results and you have to use it as directed. At least, two to three times a week. Most people probably skip out because they just don&#x27;t have the time. I use the No No on my chest, stomach, shoulders, back (as far as I can reach), under side of my arms and upper legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I received malfunctioned and would use up the large thermicon tips within two weeks. I was very disappointed because  I would have to call to get replacements every few weeks and it would set be back on the treatments. Although, the tips were free during the trial period. When I reached the 45 day mark, I decided to return the product. Perviously, no customer service rep could offer a good reason why I was having these problems and I didn&#x27;t want to be stuck having to constantly order these tips. When I spoke to this particular customer service rep. he was the first one that identified that there was an issue with the unit itself. I shouldn&#x27;t be going through tips so fast. So he offered me a replacement and a restart to the 60 day return policy and I would get an additional four thermicon tips shipped separately. So I agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer unit works much better, but the indicator still is not that good. It must be a flaw in the design. Both indicators bounced from 3 bars to 1 bar for the tip status, then back to 3 again. I&#x27;ve never seen it go to 2 bars. It&#x27;s seems it can&#x27;t really get a proper reading of the tip until it is almost at the end of its life. Also, I was disappointed that when I received the additional tips it was 2 SMALL ones and 2 LARGE ones and even though the first larger one I used didn&#x27;t wear out as fast as with the pervious unit, it still wore out in about a month.&lt;br /&gt;So, what I started doing was I used the smaller thermicon tips instead and I found they seemed to last much, much longer; at least two months. It just takes a bit longer for a treatment because of the size and the area you have to cover. My opinion is Radiancy is doing this on purpose so that they can sell more large thermicon tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s January 2014 and I find that my chest hair is much more sparse and is becoming much finer. I still get some in-grown hairs since the finer hair gets stuck under the skin. But, they are not as bad as before. I&#x27;ll use the No No about twice a week and even when the hair grows out its not as noticeable as before. There were some shoulder hairs that have actually disappeared after continually treating them with the No No. I didn&#x27;t use the No No cream because I wanted to see how the unit works on its own with using a cream that slows down the hair growth, making you think it works. But, I find it does, if you have the time and patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may edit this review in 6 months to advise if there are even more hairs that have disappeared.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> No good at all it burn my husband...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised, results take over (12) twelve months &amp; after reviewing it on line. Your hair thickness varies and can take even longer if you have thick black hair as mine.</li>
    <li> Dad wanted this. As his POA I was not keen to get it given all the bad reviews.  He&#x27;s not incompetent, just forgetful and so needs some help.  He knows what he wants and kept seeing the commercials, kept asking when I&#x27;d get it.  I kept hoping he&#x27;d forget about it. Finally, I&#x27;d run out of excuses and ordered it for him to let him decided for himself.  His response is in his usual dry humor.  He says it&#x27;s aptly named.  Does it work? No.  Was it worth it? No.  That&#x27;s a &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34; for you.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t work wish to return it it does nothing like they said it would do  very disappointed in it</li>
    <li> does not work like advertised, instructions come in Chinese only, way overpriced.</li>
    <li> Garbage. Do not buy! Has nothing to do with seller but product is not as advertised. Just might as well catch all your hair on fire with a regular lighter. It balls up the same.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like it suppose to</li>
    <li> it hasn&#x27;t made any progress with my beard. Hope I can find something that works. I do not recommend this for 60+ people.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from the mall.  I was assured that after a few weeks of regular use, I would see some results.  I did half of my chest daily with this product, the other half was shaved.  After 5 weeks of DAILY use, I so no significant difference between the 2 sides of my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to use the same technology as a bug zapper.  It has what looks like an electrified cord that skims along just above your skin, burning hairs.  The smell of burning hair is strong.  The idea is that somehow the heat of the cord travels down the hair to the root and damages the follicle.  I am not sure that this explanation is actually plausible (which is why I tried it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the letter, and notice no real results.  I think the company relies on TV orders because they hope you just wont send it back for the refund.  It is quite pricey, so I am sure that even with a significant number of returns, they still profit heavily from those who never get around to mailing it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned mine to the mall.  They said perhaps mine was defective, and offered me a new one.  They said that it happens sometimes...  which makes me trust the product even less.  I actually observed two other returns while I was waiting to have mine processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short:  This product did not work for me, as advertised.  I am disappointment, but not shocked either.</li>
    <li> This clinical investigation of the hot-wire device demonstrated it to be a novel hair removal device that produces short-term surface hair removal comparable to that achieved using a standard razor. The hot-wire device did not induce long-term reduction in hair counts, slow or delay hair regrowth, alter the thickness or color of hairs that do regrow, or offer any long-term benefit relative to shaving. [See onlinelibrary[dot]wiley[dot]com/doi/10[dot]1002/lsm[dot]22144/full for the evaluation.  Since Amazon won&#x27;t allow a link to the study, I&#x27;ve inserted [dot] for the period in the link, so anyone can find it.]</li>
    <li> Product did not work as advertised.  Even after going over an area multiple times, there still was unwanted hair. This item is practically useless.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on course body hair for men, it will work but takes a long time.</li>
    <li> I am very dissatisfied with the No!No! 8800. I understand it is suppose to remove the hair over a period of time however, for the amount of money I spent on this device, it should have shown more results than it did. It hardly removed hair as advertised. I was very dissappointed in the fact I honestly was looking forward to a better way of hair removal, than shaving. It does not work. It would remove (lightly burn off) very this, short, fine hair but only went over other hairs with no results.&lt;br /&gt;I would not reccomend this device to anyone seeking a good hair removal system. Matter of fact, I should attempt to get a refund as I only used it for about 2 weeks. I used it daily over the two week period with very little results.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even begin to live up to the hype. It is slow and would not stay on. I believe mine might have been defective because it surely didn&#x27;t cut hair like advertised, it also would keep going off, and when it was on it hardly did anything</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent over a thousand on professional electrolysis for my shoulder and back region with less results than I have had with no no.  I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews and was surprised.  I will say that it takes a while to master the operation.  I originally was going too fast, and not holding the tool at a 90 degree angle. I learned that a warm feeling means you&#x27;re doing it right.  And so too does the smell of burnt hair.  Ok, it works by hitting the hair with a red hot metal strip. Some of my hairs are tough buggers and just didn&#x27;t seem to want to go down with a pass or three.  I just figured that they&#x27;d get hit next time.  And so, using it for 20 minutes at a time while watching tv about 3-4 times per week, I went over my shoulders and back where I could reach and low and behold, in a little over a week, I had bare skin where wirey hair had been growing.  This is not like shaving.  It doesn&#x27;t come back in a day or two, but it isn&#x27;t permanent either.  Just requires maintenance (and patience).</li>
    <li> My husband bought this product both he and i tried to use it.  We did smell the hair burning, but no visible results.  This is so disappointing.</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASES. PIECE OF CRAP. Basically, the product is a hot wire (electrical wire) and trying to &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the hair off.</li>
    <li> I got this as a last minute gift for my dad. He has been looking fro a way to remove some excess hair and since watching all the infomercials on TV I thought this was a good product for him. He seems to like it and uses it a little every day.</li>
    <li> The NoNo doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. Doesn&#x27;t get the hair to the skin and leaves burnt hair stubs in the process.</li>
    <li> This item does not work. It singes your hair but it gets the same results as a pair of hair clippers.</li>
    <li> Save your money! You can get the same results by burning the hair off your body with a lighter. It stinks too because it simply is burning the unwanted hair and it barely removes the hair even on the highest setting.</li>
    <li> Having had facial surgery I anticipated an end to shaving the many new imperfections in my new face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that was not the case.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial. It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product is nothing like it claims. First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing). When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming. I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result. To treat an area sized 2-3 inches I needed to spend several hours. It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway. The product claims that it will not grow back over time, but the hair does grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial. I was worried about getting my money back given how false the other claims were. It took some aggressive screaming over the phone to get them to give me a refund, but they never refunded the cost of shipping the No!no! unit back even though in their advertising they promise it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hard to use, did no fire every time, needs to be use at a certain speed and angle&lt;br /&gt;2) Treating a small area took hours&lt;br /&gt;3) Did not work on all hair&lt;br /&gt;4) Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;5) Hair grew back&lt;br /&gt;6) Return process was difficult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Commercial (Sigh....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No! NO! NO! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> if you used no no\\&quot; before,as i have, you&#x27;ll notice a big difference in 2 to 3 weeks.very fant sting at beginning.I&#x27;ve used one for 7mos. it was working well till family borrowed mine.if trying for the first time,be sure and look for 30 or 60 day unconditional return warranty.</li>
    <li> Apparently this is supposed to work by burning the hair repeatedly so it doesn&#x27;t grow back.  It removes hair in very small patches at best and other areas it just doesn&#x27;t effect at all.  It did manage to make the house smell like hair on fire.  We hate it! I was truly looking forward to not shaving this summer and he felt the same about having to constantly shave his face.  Oh well, back to my reliable razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to see if it would really work.  I have course hair, so was told to purchase the men&#x27;s version.  It would not even &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my hair like it is supposed to.  I even went over the area more than they said, with no success.  Plus, just for giggles, I tried it on fine hair and it didn&#x27;t even work....even on the strongest level!  After continually trying to remove the hair for 3 weeks, I give up!  I would not suggest you purchase it.  It is a lot of money for a 50/50 guarantee!  I am going to try to return it today and I hope they stick to their money back guarantee and refund all of my purchase price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product factory direct, little did I know, you could have gotten these from various places.  I too followed the instructions to the letter.  After about a week with no results, the switched the setting to MAX and used it at the max since then.  About 6 months later, I still hadn&#x27;t seen any results.  At that point, I couldn&#x27;t return it anymore so now it sits at the bottom of a box, along with lots of other nick-nacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I thought about the hand-held laser hair removal product here at Amazon, but at about the same price as the no!no! and no results, I&#x27;m skeptical about any of these products.</li>
    <li> One of the heads broke fast &amp; I am trying to get a hold of someone to replace it! Please help me with the informations &amp; a phone number to do so.</li>
    <li> This takes WAY longer than shaving. And I am not seeing any of the results mentioned. finer lighter hair... ha try darker thicker hair.</li>
    <li> The NoNo device instructions are poorly displayed.  The device does not function at all.  It is dead!</li>
    <li> Just dont do its job!&lt;br /&gt;I use it only on my face cause that is the only hair it removes but still have to use the buffer to make it feel smother. Dont work on upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;Pls don&#x27;t waist your hard earned money.&lt;br /&gt;Lady L</li>
    <li> Dosent really work, its a scam</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews and still bought as a gift. Sorry to say it didn&#x27;t work after multiple attempts and returned it.</li>
    <li> the thing is a peace of crap charged it powered it up but it did nothing im thing of getting a lawyer and seu&lt;br /&gt;ing for false advertising</li>
    <li> This does work you won&#x27;t see results in a few weeks it takes a couple of months.</li>
    <li> The instruction manual is NOT in English.  Its in Japanese.  I contacted the seller and got very little cooperation.  I&#x27;d really think if the instruction manual front page can be printed in English, the box printed in English, the instructions can be too.  The video is no help, its not in other languages either.  I thought we lived in a global world, guess not.  The seller said &amp;#34;its easy, you&#x27;ll figure it out&amp;#34;..... well, if I&#x27;m using a product like this, I&#x27;d rather have instructions than go through &amp;#34;trial &amp; error&amp;#34; techniques.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product OR the Seller.</li>
