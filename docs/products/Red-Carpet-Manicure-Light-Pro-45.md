      <li>works great with gelish brand polish, very quick curing times.</li>

      <li>, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between my own and one of my friends</li>

      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty awesome :)</li>
      <li>My daughter loves it; she reports that it fries nails very quickly!</li>
      <li>So far so good, this works great.</li>
      <li>The timer worked perfectly and it is positioned on the top of the lamp so that all you have to do is give it a quick tap place your hands under the light and wait for the light to turn off.</li>
      <li>IT worked great when first purchased and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier.  </li>
      <li>it works so quickly!!</li>
      <li>I will probably get a full sized LED light at some point, but this was a good way to try doing my own gel nails.  </li>
      <li>(like I&#x27;m gripping a tennis ball).  </li>
      <li>I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just received this lamp from Amazon (much better price) and used it this weekend with my Gelish manicure.  </li>
      <li>I have used it so many times</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
      <li>My wife has cooked her fingers many times on this, and she says it&#x27;s quite lovely.</li>
      <li>so I was able to cure all of my fingers on one hand, to include the thumbs, at one time.</li>
      <li>Much better than the battery operated models.  </li>
      <li>and when I wipe off my top coat, the color would come off with it letting me know that the color wasn&#x27;t fully cured.  </li>
      <li>Save your money and buy something more legitimate.  </li>
      <li>i am sure they could have lasted longer).</li>
      <li>and I did not have to cure them for more than 45 seconds - the light turns off after 45 seconds which is really nice</li>
      <li>I travel infrequently these days, but when I do, it is often for a week or more...</li>
      <li>Love this LED Llight.</li>
      <li>and I get a better set on my gel when I use it for 90 seconds versus 45 as it recommends.  </li>
      <li>love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I switched products.</li>
      <li>Perfect for gellish nail polish or red carpet polish.  </li>
      <li>I was using a UV light to do my gel manicures and it was taking forever!</li>
      <li>I love using the gel</li>
      <li>More for home use.</li>
      <li>The light works like a charm for curing each polish coat!</li>
      <li>Save me so much money doing my nails at home and the price was great.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that the lights dont hurt the skin like UV lights do.</li>
      <li>and my husband asked me to continue doing my nails while watching our favorite show.</li>
      <li>I still feel the battery powered LED lamp cures better</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Sets fast and works great with the gelish line.</li>
      <li>Im amazed at how many people are saying they use this every two weeks or have had it for months.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far so good, this works great. The button on top starts the timer for 45 seconds of light. The product is lightweight and easy to use. I have gone through 5 round of gel polish with no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this from ulta, I followed the directions by applying a thin layer of each and never touching nails w/fingers, i wiped with lint free wipe from ibd and there was no polish color coming off not sure what others are doing wrong. I&#x27;m on week two and my polish is still glossy and intact. Great buy...:)</li>
    <li> Worked perfect. No problems great price.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic if you read the directions and follow them. I had great luck and my nails looked great. Lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves hers</li>
    <li> This product does work well my only complaint is that it would be nice if it was a little wider so you don&#x27;t accidentally hit your hand</li>
    <li> Works great with CND shellac polish! I have to press the button 3 times for each layer, but it does its job for a great price.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this at Ulta Beauty, I was really excited to see that it was really affordable since I was used to seeing LED nail lamps for a lot more expensive.  I now realize that you get what you pay for.  This tiny LED nail lamp only has 3 small led bulbs inside.  I had a very hard time getting my gels to cure evenly. Time and time again, I would cure my gels for 45 seconds to 1 minute and when I wipe off my top coat, the color would come off with it letting me know that the color wasn&#x27;t fully cured.  Keep in mind, this was even after 1 minute of curing!  It advertises 45 seconds, but that&#x27;s hardly the truth.  Especially with darker colors, I would leave my fingers in there for over a minute and I just can&#x27;t get an even cure.  Save your money and buy something more legitimate.  Why spend the money on gels only to waste it on improper cures?  I returned this lamp promptly at Ulta.  Thank goodness for their return policy.  I can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend this lamp.</li>
    <li> I felt the need to write this review because I almost returned it without trying it based on the first review. I bought the gel polish-uv light kit at ulta. The first time I used it, I followed the directions very carefully and it turned out perfectly. I&#x27;ve used it weekly now for about six weeks and each time it turns out beautifully! I do them weekly because I&#x27;m a \\&quot;picker\\&quot;...as soon as they grow out a bit I start picking at them. I&#x27;m sure if you can leave the space between the grown out nail and the cuticle alone, they would last longer. FYI I have never had a gel mani done at home or in a salon...I admired a friend&#x27;s and she told me she did it herself. She recommended that I  \\&quot;you tube\\&quot; it for tips on doing the manicure as well as removing it.</li>
    <li> Find it a little too small, wish it was slightly bigger. Have to get another one as it is too small for commercial use. More for home use.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Save me so much money doing my nails at home and the price was great. Couldn&#x27;t find one cheaper any where else.</li>
    <li> i love it is really 45 sec</li>
    <li> So far so good after about 10 uses.  My mother has a similar light from another brand that wasn&#x27;t working for me, but was fine for her.  After a few tries, I discovered I wasn&#x27;t really buffing all around the edges of the nail and thus the polish peeled after a few days.  Now that I do it correctly, even her light works for me.  It&#x27;s all in the prep!</li>
    <li> After using several other lamps, this, hands down is the BEST! Buy it. Works great and it&#x27;s easy on the pocket.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and this is great :) Gel nail polish definitely lasts longer than regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> I bought the unit during the time I was on holiday in the usa. I made a bad choice because it does not cure, do not worry, not working properly. I live in Brazil and I have no way to return product. Total disappointment.</li>
    <li> Not that great of a product. My daughter much prefers going to the salon for nail gels, save your money.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this LED nail lamp and love it. Not only does it work great for regular nail polish but gel nails at home as well. Way quicker than letting nails air dry on its own! Bring the salon to your home with this great, mini nail lamp. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Received everything with no problems in reasonable time. Works like a charm and came with all the chems needed :) Pleasant surprise!</li>
    <li> This light is great!  I had a UV - 36W before where you have to use 4 bulbs.  It&#x27;s huge and lights need to be replaced.  This is amazing.  I don&#x27;t mind that entire hand doesn&#x27;t fit, because i typically do big finger nails separate anyway.</li>
    <li> I purchased the professional LED light and it stopped working.  Contacted Red Carpet and they are sending out a new one (I do have to send back the old one).  Awesome customer service!  Way to go Red Carpet!</li>
    <li> It is small, very light, packs well --- I LOVE IT and I love my new nails. It is large enough for a child&#x27;s hand or 4 fingers of an adult - JUST AS STATED! IT REALLY DOES CURE THE POLISH IN 45 SECONDS. I only wish I had purchased earlier:)</li>
    <li> My wife had the portable, battery powered version of this light from RCM so I wanted to get her the Pro light as a sort of upgrade.  It definitely did the job!  She has such an easier time with her nails now as they get done much quicker!  She loves it!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I just received this lamp from Amazon (much better price) and used it this weekend with my Gelish manicure.  Worked perfect.  I&#x27;m not sure why some reviewers had problems with it curing properly, I had no issues at all and I used the preset 45 second timer on the lamp for each layer.  I would not let this discourage you from purchasing this lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also, would not let the issue about not being able to get all 4 fingers and your thumb in there at one time discourage you either because you can do that.  Just lay the thumb of your opposite hand on top of the other hand curing and Voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were like me and using a UV lamp to do your Gelish manicures and waiting 2-3 minutes per layer, you will wonder like me why you didn&#x27;t get an LED light sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this lamp is small but it is plenty big enough to get the job done and I like the fact that it is small.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much room.  It is light and would be very easy to travel with.  I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very fast curing.  Much better than the battery operated models.  I hate the burning sensation but it is brief and the results are wonderful</li>
    <li> Worked for finishing my gel nail polish as I had expected.  This is a very simple product.  The &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button leaves the light on for 30 seconds.  Per the instructions with the light, finishing the top coat requires 45 seconds so there is some estimation for 45 seconds.  The outcome of my gel nail manicure was very good with a hard shiny finish.</li>
    <li> when my UV light died and came to amazon to find a replacement and ended up with this little guy instead. it&#x27;s literally 1/5th the size of my old light (if not even less) so it&#x27;s SUCH a space saver. love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: i did think it was going to work with my CND polishes, but it did NOT. however, works like a charm with my gelish brand polishes and it&#x27;s worth it to me to have the extra shelf space rather than go back tot he UV light which worked with both brands.</li>
    <li> I was using a UV light to do my gel manicures and it was taking forever! Probably took me an hour do do both hands. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try since the curing times were so much quicker. I was skeptical until I tried it. Works perfect. Cures in 45 seconds. Yes, you do have to do your thumbs separate, but I was already doing that with the other light. Now it only takes about 30 minutes to do both hands. It&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where these bad reviews come from. I have had this lamp for over a year and use it to do my nails every 2 weeks since I purchased it. I have never had a problem curing the polish I use. I have used Gelish, OPI, Nail Paints and almost every kind of gel polish there is out there with all ranges from light to dark colors and never had a problem curing. I have also bought this same lamp for a friend of mine and my mother and it works fine for them as well. I definitely recommend this over any expensive lamp you can buy in stores! A+ for sure.</li>
    <li> I have used this light 6-7 times now. it cures the gel nail lacquer perfectly. It&#x27;s compact enough to pack in a suitcase, yet large enough to place all 4 fingers in at once. Great product so far.</li>
    <li> Good product:  works well, compact, has a built-in timer.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife, she loves it.  She does her nails all the time.  Dries her nails pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This item is great for anyone who hates constantly touching up and removing chipped nail polish.  The LED light dries quickly.  Doing your own manicures will save you money.  This product sells for $49.99 at Ulta, and I found it less expensive on Amazon.  If you consider that the manicure will last at least a week, you save time.  If you consider it costs $25+ for a gel manicure at a salon, it only takes a few at home manicures to save you tons of cash.  I had the battery operated light before, and it took forever to dry all the layers.  With this pro light, it sped up the drying time immensely.  A gel manicure makes a person look more put together, and \\&quot;polished.\\&quot;  :p</li>
    <li> WOW, I love this product. I can carry it anywhere!! I had to get ready for my girlfriends wedding and need to do my nails ASAP.  I carried this in my purse and after I got my hair and makeup done I busted this out and did my nails really quick.  So, far I had this product for awhile now and it works very well and has lasted me till now. Overall, great product</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over an hour. The LED light is a joke. My nail polish will NOT cure. Im amazed at how many people are saying they use this every two weeks or have had it for months. This is horrible. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I thougth that It could dry more fast but at least it works for me. It´s cheap but if I had to buy another, I would buy another one</li>
    <li> Great buy. I love the fact that the lights dont hurt the skin like UV lights do. So easy to do your feet to. I would highly recommend this produce!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it states. It really does take only 45 seconds to cure each layer. This is my second one and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the red carpet manicure light. I love using the gel and it sets it very nicely. With this I can do y own nails at my leisure. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> Saves me a lot of money going to the salon. Lasts about a week and a half and very easy to use! Nails were a little damaged after first use but my nails are usually very thin and they break, split and peel after any exposure to water so this definitely keeps them long and looking great! Fun to change up the colors and designs!</li>
    <li> I like this machine.  It&#x27;s too small for all 5 fingers and I get a better set on my gel when I use it for 90 seconds versus 45 as it recommends.  It&#x27;s lasting well so far and I would probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this at Ulta along with the starter kit.  I followed the directions with the base coat, 2 coats of color and one coat of clear.  Then I wiped my nails with the solution provided (which just smells like rubbing alcohol) and they looked exactly like I had gone to a salon!  I had no problems with them curing evenly and I did not have to cure them for more than 45 seconds - the light turns off after 45 seconds which is really nice so you don&#x27;t have to time it.  I&#x27;ve used it since then on my nails and on my toes and every time has been perfect.  For $50 for the light and $30 for the starter kit, I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> This lamp works great!  It&#x27;s the same shape as the one in the picture, except that it is white and Gelish brand (not Red Carpet).  I&#x27;m happy, I bought it to go with Gelish polishes anyway.  It&#x27;s compact, which is perfect for me, doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of room on my desk or with my stash.  I can fit all four fingers in it, then I cure my thumbs together separately.  Goes so fast since the LED only takes 45 seconds to cure at the max, and the auto timer is awesome.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This thing has been a fantastic addition to my life!! Until a few months ago, I had never tried gel polishes. I didn&#x27;t want the UV light, as I had tried that and it wasn&#x27;t my favorite. I ended up sending it back. It heated up the nails so much it felt like they were on fire - Plus - UV rays &#x3D; Cancer. SO... no thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Than I stumbled upon this little gem. It&#x27;s so small, light, portable and it works so quickly!! I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to complain about anything at all, it is that it is too small to accomodate a full hand... you have to do your fingers and thumbs separately - it is very small. You also have to be very careful not to hit the back of it with your fingertips, as it is fairly shallow. Who needs depth though... you&#x27;re only trying to dry the polish on your nails - as long as you&#x27;re careful, and don&#x27;t mind doing your thumbs separately - then I would say go for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty awesome :)</li>
    <li> I have used this lamp for just about a year now. I have had no problems up until my last two manicures. I noticed my polish wasn&#x27;t as hard as it should be. ( I could put a dent in it with another fingernail, and it would slowly pop back out. ) When this first happened I thought maybe I was to blame, maybe I had applied the polish too thick. But after I had the same problem a second time, I knew better. Plus, after applying my Gelish TIO, I wiped off the tacky layer with alcohol and some  of my color came off.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed this lamp did not last longer than one year.</li>
    <li> I will probably get a full sized LED light at some point, but this was a good way to try doing my own gel nails.  It&#x27;s been working well with my Gelish Mini Starter Kit with both Sensational and Gelish gel polishes. I&#x27;ve done 6 sets of finger nails and one set of toe nails.  This is really tough to use on toes due to its mini size, but I could balance the light on my foot, and as long as I did the big toe separately, it worked correctly.  Dark colors really need to have an extra time under the light - especially if you&#x27;re just learning, like me, and tend to get the color on a little too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2013-01-05 - Got a full sized one, gave this one to my (adult) daughter... and now I am scheduled for an extended business trip and am thinking - I need to buy another one!  My full sized one has more LEDs in it and does cure the nails faster (and I can put all of my fingers and thumb in it at the same time, so that also cuts down on the cure time), but it will take up wayyy too much space for traveling.  I travel infrequently these days, but when I do, it is often for a week or more... so if I want to change my nails during that time... Yes, I think I will be buying another one prior to my trip.</li>
    <li> Love this LED Llight. It&#x27;s affordable and does a really really good job. It cures and drys them really fast.</li>
    <li> Perfect for gellish nail polish or red carpet polish.  It&#x27;s a compact light too so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space, yet still able to fit four fingers at a time in the light.</li>
    <li> The RC Manicure Light Pro 45 works well and the auto timer is a nice feature but the product stopped working short of one year.  So be prepared to purchase a new one every year!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Amazon but the product I received was the Gelish (brand) Pro 45.  I used it with the Red Carpet Manicure starter set and Red Carpet Manicure nail polish.  It worked great.  It turns off in 45 seconds and did an excellent job curing my gel manicure.  First manicure was done tonight in less than 15 minutes and it looks great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this light at Ulta approx 9-12 months ago using it approx 1-2 times per month.  IT worked great when first purchased and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier.  But now, the light bulbs are starting to die and the polish wipes off at the last step leaving your manicure looking terrible.  This lamp cost $50.  Not sure if it is going to save me money doing my manicure at home if I have to purchase a $50 product every year!  I am really disappointed that the bulbs can&#x27;t be changed on the light.</li>
    <li> I love this led light!!! I usually use a UV light to cure my gelish manicures, but I decided to buy an led one so I don&#x27;t get the harmful uv rays. This light is so much faster than using a uv light. It took me about 30 minutes to do a manicure, compared to over an hour when I used the uv light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people in the other reviews have complained about this light being too small and having to cure your thumbs separately.  I don&#x27;t find this to be a big deal at all since each time you cure, it takes only 45 seconds. Also, when you get your nails done at a salon, they usually cure your thumbs separately too so it&#x27;s not a big deal having to do that at home. Overall, I love this light and I definitely recommend it especially for the low price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care to write reviews about products but i absolutely love this this manicure set!!! I usually paint my own nails from time to time and i have to re-due them every two days but now my polish last so long, I take it off just bc I want to change the color. Also It really has the salon quality, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between my own and one of my friends gel mani&#x27;s from a nail salon. All in all I would highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s dosent want to spend $80-100 a month on nails you can do at home with the same quality. As long as you follow every step you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
    <li> I love this light so much more than my regular LED one. This one only takes 45 seconds versus 2-3 minutes on my old one. I use it with Gelish products, and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I use this lamp with a combination of Gelish polishes, store brand gel polishes, etc, and it has done well with all varieties. I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> RCM and Gelish are apparently the same brand so I was confident prior to buying this that it would work for my Gelish system and my RCM colors equally well.  It did.  In fact, this is SO superior to my regular UV light that I won&#x27;t ever go back.  It clearly cures faster but harder as well.  I guess maybe my bulbs were weakened in my regular UV light.  It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a gauge or anything, so really, how would I have known?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do an entire hand at once, I just pick up the light with my other hand and curl my \\&quot;to cure\\&quot; nails in (like I&#x27;m gripping a tennis ball).  Works just fine.  In fact, I like that I don&#x27;t have to maneuver wet nails into a small box because my nails always seemed to hit something or find dog fur somehow.  Also, it&#x27;s kinda cool to watch.  The Gelish Top It Off glows under the light so I can see if I&#x27;ve missed an area, like the tips.  Just don&#x27;t be an idiot like me and do touch ups with the top coat while the light is still on.  You will ruin the brush.  On the plus side, it was cool to watch it cure...less cool that it cured to my nail.  Yes I know.  Very dumb moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is my understanding that an LED light is still a type of UV light, so clear folks like me should be aware.  Luckily it&#x27;s only 45 seconds per layer (unlike the 5 minutes for my old UV!) so it&#x27;s still no where near as dangerous.</li>
    <li> Works great! But would be better if you could fit all 5 fingers and maybe a timer option. Other than that she really liked it.</li>
    <li> after buying a cheap nail light on amazon before this one, I was losing hope for cheap nail lights to work, I decided to give this one a try after reading reviews on this one from Ulta store. I love it, it works great I use it with my Gelish nail polish, cure each coat 45 secs and make sure after curing your last coat (top coat) you wipe your nails with alcohol this cures the nails and removes the stickiness from the nail polish.</li>
    <li> I thought I would like how small and sleek this lamp is compared to my roommates huge UV lamp and now I regret buying the small lamp. You have to do one hand at a time and only 4 nails at a time then your thumb and repeat the process on the other hand it takes forever. You are basically doing each curing process 4 times. I may cave and buy the large 2 hand lamp so I only have to do the process once.</li>
    <li> have used this several years. never a problem</li>
    <li> I really like the Red Carpet&lt;br /&gt;Manicure Light Pro 45 product.  It works very well and fast drying.  Compact too.</li>
    <li> This lamp may cost more than most but it is completely  it. Other brands have you cure your nails for a minute or longer. With the red carpet manicure light pro, it only takes 45 seconds. I love it. Not only that but their gel polishes work the best. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:197227213cbd5b7e69842c20ca6fe83d]]I write this having just spent THREE HOURS attempting to complete a basic gel manicure.  And just my luck, sometimes, the Amazon reviews don&#x27;t accurately reflect the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the box, it takes only 45 seconds to cure one layer of polish.  This should&#x27;ve been the first red flag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one THIN LAYER of Gelish polish, it took...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not two...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not three...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not four...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But FIVE curing treatments for the already THIN layer of Gelish polish to MOSTLY dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The math:  45 seconds x 5 treatments &#x3D; 225 seconds or...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost four minutes to almost dry ONE THIN layer of Gelish polish.  It takes at least 4-5 layers of polish to complete one gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too add insult to injury, they&#x27;re still not dry.  They&#x27;re tacky and sticky after the alcohol rubdown.  I&#x27;m going to remove the polish and just use regular polish until a new actual UV lamp with UV bulbs comes in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box didn&#x27;t give much description of the actual bulbs used to cure the polish, which should&#x27;ve been red flag #2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I opened the box and removed curing lamp, I didn&#x27;t find actual UV bulbs, but three itsy, bitsy, teeny, tiny little pinpricks of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a video to show what the box doesn&#x27;t show, that there aren&#x27;t any actual UV bulbs in the lamp.  Just those little teeny lights.  Which, when turned on appear powerfully bright, but in practice are nothing more than \\&quot;bright.\\&quot;  They don&#x27;t dry or cure anything worth a darn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, these teeny, tiny little bulbs can&#x27;t be replaced in the future, as they are permanently attached to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time bargain shopping pays off.  This isn&#x27;t one of those times. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m returning this product.  I wish I could shared the glowing reviews with the rest of the shoppers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion isto not skimp on quality this time around. Actually buy something with more power in its punch, or else you will have to pencil in DIY gel manicure on your calendar, because it will take you all night long just to finish a manicure... let alone a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Godspeed, fellow Gellers.  Avoid, Avoid, Avoid this \\&quot;lamp.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2-12-15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a different, more powerful UV lamp with actual UV bulbs and it works wonderfully.  I&#x27;m glad I switched products.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been doing her own nails since she was in elementary school and has become quite the nail artist over the last 15 or so years.  She received this lamp as a gift in September 2013 and when she first used it, she loved it.  (I should also mention that it used to sell for $35 on Amazon!) Her only negative comment about it was the size, but for the price she couldn&#x27;t complain.  It worked wonderfully for the first two or three months she had it, then it slowly began to decline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The lights are much dimmer than they were when it was brand new and they don&#x27;t cure the nails as evenly as they once did.  The very first manicure she did with this lamp last for three weeks and she only took it off because it was grown out. She did my nails the same day and mine lasted four weeks.  I removed mine for the same reason: nail growth.  Neither of us had any lifting or chipping AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, she and I started noticing that the manicures began to lift after about a week.  We generally did not remove them because it wasn&#x27;t noticeable to anyone but us.  It was still annoying because if weren&#x27;t careful with our hands, the lifted polish often snagged on something.  My daughter was able to remedy this by re-sealing the free edge, but that only helped the manicure last for another week and it did not look as nice as it did when it was fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been using the same polishes (RCM, Gelish, Ink, and others) throughout the months and they all seem to have the same issue.  We attributed the lifting to the light because she preps the nail properly (doesn&#x27;t get polish on skin, uses ultra thin layers...in short she does it the same way (if not better) than a salon would) and it doesn&#x27;t seem likely that every brand of polish would have the same problem.  She did research to determine what was causing the lifting, and the only issue that seemed to fit was the fact that the lamp is losing strength.  We still weren&#x27;t sure the lamp was theissue, not until the last few manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last three manicures she&#x27;s done (two on my nails and one on hers) the lamp failed to cure the nails evenly.  Both of our left pinkies and her left index finger failed to cure on the outer edge. When she cleaned off the tacky residue with alcohol, part of the polish came with it.  She was able to fix it by roughing up the polish and filling in the gaps, but I have a feeling that it is only going to get worse.  We now cure our nails for double the amount of time, which is also irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the lamp lasted and performed as it did when it was new, this review would surely be FIVE STARS! The small size doesn&#x27;t bother me. I expected it to be small based on the picture and the size does not affect curing; it just takes extra time to do thumbs. it&#x27;s also a challenge to do pedicures because all 5 toes don&#x27;t fit under the lamp WITH toe separators on.  Neither my daughter nor I do gel pedicures, so again, this isn&#x27;t much of an issue.  If you are expecting to be able to cure your entire hand at once or if you want to use it for pedicure and need to use toe separators to prevent wreckage, you might want to consider going for a larger lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another con about this lamp is that the bulbs are not replaceable.  If it dies, you have to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I wanted to just throw it out there that we may have gotten a faulty product.  There seem to be very few reviews with issues similar to mine (though they&#x27;re out there), so I conclude that to mean that 1. we received a semi-faulty lamp 2. the other lamps aren&#x27;t used as often and therefore haven&#x27;t died yet or 3. expectations shouldn&#x27;t be so high for a lamp of this size and price and reviewers expected some faults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone asked if I recommended this lamp, I would tell them my experience and let them weigh it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful, even though it was extremely long!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to gel nails but decided to do my own to save money.  I had a uv lamp but the gels took to long to dry.  This lamp works great and cuts the time down tremendously.</li>
    <li> I purchased this light a few weeks ago and it works great. It has a 45 sec timer but that&#x27;s all it takes to set the gel.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really cure or dry</li>
    <li> I purchased this from drugstore.com because of a 10 dollar off coupon so I got mine for 40. I wanted an LED because UV lights give off UV rays and take triple the time to cure. This LED light only takes 45 seconds max, thats perfect. I searched high and low for an affordable LED which I found were ridiculously expensive at around 100 bucks.  Only thing is that you can&#x27;t cure your thumb at the same time but I found a trick that works for me, fold over your four fingers next to your thumb (not covering your thumb) and put the light over all your fingers. Works like a charm. My ac adaptor was defective, it was making a wierd noise turns out if was not normal, drugstore.com sent me a return label and shipped me a new lamp and no more noise.  They were great about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind, some gel products will NOT work with both LED and UV you NEED to find out if a certain brand will work with your LED or UV light, Gelish works with my LED and UV light but eco/star brand ONLY works with UV light. If you use the wrong product for your light your gel will start peeling and cracking by the end of the day, it&#x27;s not the products fault, each line of gel has its own chemical composition that will only work with either/or sometimes both like gelish does. Because of this I may purchase a small UV light, as I don&#x27;t like to be bogged down to only one brand. I know that they are making UV/LED in one but at very high prices, until then I will stick with my little 40 dollar lamp happily...</li>
    <li> I found that if you need to use it to cure longer than recommended. It has paid off itself already.I bought this after reading other reviews and am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It works great.  I travel with the light, so it helps that it is compact.  I use it with Daisy or Harmony product.  My days of going to nail salon is over.  I do my own and friend&#x27;s nails.  I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I saw some people had bad reviews on this product. Don&#x27;t worry too much because it does work.  I have used it so many times and I have no problems curing my colors. If you wipe the topcoat with alcohol And color comes off, You may not have covered the color with the top coat well enough. (Watch the edges.) I can&#x27;t even describe to you how much I love this light. My nails always look awesome now.  You can accomplish this result with other LED lights, but this one certainly works.</li>
    <li> I bought this light for around $33 during Amazon&#x27;s Black Friday sales. There is no need to buy the $80 Pro 45 starter kit because if you watch for sales, you can build the kit for around $40 yourself. You just need the light, the structure base coat &amp; brilliance top coat from Red Carpet Manicure (or any base and top gel polish), and a bottle of rubbing alcohol. That&#x27;s it. The &amp;#34;Erase&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Purify&amp;#34; from the kits are basically glorified, over-priced bottles of rubbing alcohol. Just apply rubbing alcohol to fingernails, then base coat, then your polish coats, then the top and wipe the sticky residue away with rubbing alcohol. The light works like a charm for curing each polish coat!</li>
    <li> It just looks cool, but It took too long to dry the nail. I don&#x27;t use it anymore. It&#x27;s not good.</li>
    <li> This works in half the time as my non-LED nail light. I&#x27;ve done a manicure a week without the bulbs burning out. So much cheaper and convenient to do your own gels at home. I use this with Shellac polish. Have also used Gellish. Great results, never any problems.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cute and small. This is such a good equipment to get for color gel and everyone can afford it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you want but for cheaper.uaed this with the gelish system and it cured perfectly.  Just remember the tips of your fingernails to fully seal in the polish..</li>
    <li> I was finding the light was not curing the color sufficiently no matter how thin I made my coats. Every time I would apply my clear top coat it would smear into the clear brush. I was very upset about this and my husband asked me to continue doing my nails while watching our favorite show. I unplugged it from the surge protector and took it with me to the living room. It seems the light, when plugged into the other outlet with less of a power struggle, is curing more efficiently. I am not sure whether this is a fluke or not so I am only rating it 3 stars for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if your light doesn&#x27;t seem to be curing as well as everyone else&#x27;s, try moving to a different outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be continued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I still am having good luck with using it in an otherwise empty outlet. 4 stars! I still feel the battery powered LED lamp cures better BUT I just can&#x27;t stand taking the extra time to cure so the time outweighs the curing for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quick small and amazing I love it!! thumbs don&#x27;t fit my only stress but still awesome !! Would recommend</li>
    <li> I tried multiple replacements after being assured of the efficacy of this product at Ulta and still doesn&#x27;t cure any gel polish.</li>
    <li> works great with gelish brand polish, very quick curing times. You have to follow the instructions for the gel products to work properly and cure properly, do each step as described by the polish brand, and apply thin coats of each product. It will dry/cure in this light!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this light for over a year now, It works like a charm. I was a little put off when i first received this, taking it out of the box it just felt like a toy, very light weight, it didn&#x27;t feel like heavy duty salon style equipment, but it works just as well. The only real issue is that you can&#x27;t do all of one hand at a time, but that&#x27;s honestly not that big a deal, I paint four fingers from one hand and the thumb from the other hand and cure those all together then switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve saved so much money by doing my own gel manicures at home, use this machine twice and it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Not too expensive and really does the trick. My wife uses this about every other week and her gel coats hold up perfectly in between.</li>
    <li> This little LED manicure light has been good to be so far. I have had it since January and have had no issues. I save a ton of money doing my nails myself!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews and the price, and am not unhappy with my purchase. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I only wish I could fit my thumb in with the rest of my fingers. Oh well! An extra 2 minutes isn&#x27;t such a terrible burden to bear.</li>
    <li> great! love the product - easy to use and very easy to store. compact, simple,efficient , and travels very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this lamp and all of my RCM products. I recomend this lamp to all of my gel nail DIY friends.</li>
    <li> I bought another product before I purchase this one. But I ended up changing for this product. I love the fact that it automatically cure in 45 sec and turns off afterwards. Plus the fact of its portability .</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would work well and it does, cuts a ton of time off the manicure from the UV.  I use Gelish products and it works Great!</li>
    <li> This light works great! Used it about 10 times already in the past month. Sets fast and works great with the gelish line.</li>
    <li> This small UV led lamp is just the perfection when you want to start doing Gel Polish yourself at home.&lt;br /&gt;His small size allowed you to take it everywhere with you (it&#x27;s ultra light).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This UV leds work perfectly for curing the my Gelish Harmony colors. The 45sec set timing is so easy to use and it&#x27;s so quick !&lt;br /&gt;So far I have done 20 manicures and none of them last less than 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always do my thombs first and then the other fingers. I didn&#x27;t try yet on my feet but I&#x27;m sure you can easily use it for.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of gel manicures since they came out. I used to pay a lot of money at the salon (35 + tip) to get a french gel manicure. My salon get manicures always lasted about 5-7 days, so I expected this product to do the same. I am hard on my nails- regular manicures maybe last a day with out chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually lasted longer than the gel manicures I recieved at the salon. I have done about 4 different manicures since having the kit- each lasted longer than 5-7 days. (8-10 days generally- with touch ups i am sure they could have lasted longer). I have saved a lot of money and time (with practice I can definitely do it faster than the salon pros) using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they had more color options!</li>
    <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t beat this little light. It is small so you can only cure 4 fingers at once and it&#x27;s a little tight for all 5 toes but it does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do and it cut my manicure time significantly. I love the built-in 45 second timer - no more timing with my iphone!  I use it with both OPI and Gelish brands.</li>
    <li> works good but small, better than paying a bunch of money the larger ones though</li>
    <li> After a few trips to the salon for a gel manicure, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try at home. I first purchased a less expensive UV lamp, which was probably 5 times bigger in size than this one. I love the small size of this lamp as it barely takes up any space with my nail supplies. The Red Carpet Manicure Light Pro is a tiny-sized LED lamp that cures  faster and more efficiently than the bigger UV I had purchased. I have small hands so I was able to cure all of my fingers on one hand, to include the thumbs, at one time. The timer worked perfectly and it is positioned on the top of the lamp so that all you have to do is give it a quick tap place your hands under the light and wait for the light to turn off. I found a keeper and would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Way too small. Invest in a larger one.</li>
    <li> My wife has cooked her fingers many times on this, and she says it&#x27;s quite lovely. So 5 stars! Plus it hasn&#x27;t broken, which would mean I would need to buy more expensive.  I think we&#x27;ve owned this for quite some time and my wife has used this more than enough times to justify this review.</li>
    <li> Hey guys ... I&#x27;ve heard that the bulbs for these new LED lamps are NOT replaceable ... that the whole lamp must be replaced when the bulb(s) die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1.  Does anyone know what is the case for THIS particular lamp?  Must the whole lamp be replaced?&lt;br /&gt;  2.  How long do the LED bulb(s) typically last?&lt;br /&gt;  3.  If replaceable, what is the replacement cost for a new bulb?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for any and all info you can provide.</li>
    <li> Update:  It&#x27;s BROKEN!!!  I pulled it out of the box to do my THIRD manicure and the light doesn&#x27;t turn on!!  I only got to use it twice before it crapped out on me.  I am not at all surprised that this product failed, it&#x27;s made VERY cheaply.  I even had it stored it in a plastic tupperware to try to prolong it&#x27;s crappy little life.  I&#x27;m bummed I wasted my money (after only two uses, I didn&#x27;t even break even if I had gone to a salon!).  The only good thing about it breaking is that I get to get a nicer one. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box I was disappointed on how tiny it was and how flimsy it felt.  You can only do your fingers OR your tumb at one time, not both.  Also if you keep your nails any longer that \\&quot;short and active\\&quot; length you will need a bigger light, I keep my nails pretty short and keep hitting the back of the lamp. :(  It does the job but really makes you feel like you should have gotten a little more for your  money.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it; she reports that it fries nails very quickly!</li>
    <li> A friend requested this as a gift.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> This light works perfect for doing your own gel manicure at home. You just plug it in and press the button and it turns off after 45 seconds so you don&#x27;t have to watch the clock.</li>
    <li> Worked twice but then broke. was bey disappointed but two manicures would cost more than this lamp so I got my usage out of it. Ended up going to Walmart and getting a long lasting Sensational lamp.</li>
    <li> I bought the Thermal Spa UV light from Amazon, which does what it is supposed to do, but I definitely prefer the speed of using the Red Carpet LED light.  For those of you who wish you could fit a whole hand in it and not have to cure your thumbs separately, I polish 4 fingers of one hand and the thumb of the other hand and cure them.  It takes a little getting used to and you have to make sure you flatten the thumb, but it does save time.</li>
    <li> ****Written by my wife****&lt;br /&gt;Super bright and cures the polish very well. Pretty expensive, but does a good job and if it lasts the price is worth it.</li>
