      <li>Due to being old and rickety, I can&#x27;t reach my left foot so this tool solves the hygiene problem very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Came with broken tip where between toe brush goes</li>
    <li> What I received was not at all as described. There was one handlebar a large sponge head already attached. The sponge head was sort of triangular shaped. Only one rounded &amp;#34;corner&amp;#34; could even remotely fit between any toes, and that would only be between the big toe and second toe. WAY too big to fit between any others. This was a huge disappointment and waste of money! If I could no stars, I would.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> My Mom has severe arthritis in her hips, so she can&#x27;t bend over to reach/clean her feet anymore.  I bought the Foot Cleaning Brush for her and she LOVES it.  Not only can she scrub her feet well, but she can even get in between her toes.  This is a godsend for those who can&#x27;t reach their feet to clean them.</li>
    <li> Husband need hip replacement. Helps him clean between toes</li>
    <li> This long handled foot cleaning brush is useful for the elderly, diabetics, &amp; the large. Just be gentle as the plastic looks like it might snap if too much pressure is applied. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> None of these products are for me, so therefore hard to review.  I believe my mom likes it.</li>
    <li> At 68 years young my body does not have the same abilities as before but thanks to someone&#x27;s idea I can now function better.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is pretty much a standard foot brush, like hospitals here in NC give patients of hip replacement.  It works well.</li>
    <li> This product is a rip-off -- just cheap plastic crap.</li>
    <li> I would not call it a brush--it&#x27;s a sponge on a plastic stick. How good it is depends on your feet. There is little room between my smallest toes and the next one.  Therefore it is a challenge to get the sponge between them.  But I do get it done by pushing and twisting the sponge. Over all I use it.</li>
    <li> This has come in handy for me after hip surgery to help clean my feet.</li>
    <li> A big help stronger built then I expected</li>
    <li> Foam fell off after one wash between toes, it sticks, don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
    <li> This is a flimsy waste of plastic. Fist time I used the brush to wash between my toes the sponge slipped off the brush handle. The sponge is only attached to the brush handle by pushing a plastic tab into a slit cut into it. Any slight pull on it while washing causes the sponge to fall off. Totally worthless.</li>
    <li> This foot brush is very good.  It is light weight and comes with two toe sponges and one round sponge about 5\\&quot; in diameter.  It performs its function. The sponges are on a clip-in-place lock and not what is pictured above.  I&#x27;m disappointed because my original foot brush was broken and I have four toe sponge refills which screw into the bruch handle.  My refills are the same as pictured in the product page.  So I have a new foot bruch which does the job and 4 extra sponges which I can not use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 5 stars for the foot brush, take away 1 star for the wrong picture &#x3D; 4.</li>

    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS. I AM DISABLED AND DOING MY FEET IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE BUT WITH THIS I CAN GET IN BETWEEN MY TOES WITH EASE AND IT IS GREAT TO APPLY LOTION.</li>
    <li> Great to clean between byour toes when you are disabled</li>
    <li> Best gift for Dad this Xmas! Love it. With diabetes you need to take great care of your feet. This helps keep the between the toes fresh.</li>
    <li> This is a good tool.  You can scrub between your toes while standing up in the shower.  Due to being old and rickety, I can&#x27;t reach my left foot so this tool solves the hygiene problem very well.</li>
    <li> great, works well and very easy to use</li>
