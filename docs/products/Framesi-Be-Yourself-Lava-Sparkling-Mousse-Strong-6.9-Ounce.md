    <li> My hairdresser has used this for years &amp; I could not find it anywhere in town. Excellent product. I highly recommend it!,</li>
    <li> Use a small amount and you will have a light hold power along with a soft sparkle under lights.  The fragrance is heavenly.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this mousse on my hair in her shop and I liked the way it held my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t look or feel sticky or stiff. She picked up a bottle for me but when I searched for it, found it at a much better price here. If you&#x27;ve used this product, this is a good price. If you haven&#x27;t and use mousse or gel, give it a try.</li>

    <li> Purchased three cans of the Framesi Mousse and I was please with the product.  It has just the right amount of hold.  Very pleased with the vendor.  The item arrived earlier than expected and packaging was good.&lt;br /&gt;Good experience!</li>
    <li> I love this product-- better prices on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mousse. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have fine hair, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but actually keeps it buoyant for a few days. I do add other products, but when I only use the mousse my hair has a soft look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was when it was shipped, the cap was cracked a little bit. It had a piece of tape to keep it stuck to the can, but in the end I just used the tape to repair the crack. Considering I received free shipping at the time, it didn&#x27;t matter to me too much! The product is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is the only mousse I use, and it&#x27;s totally worth the money.  It keeps hair from frizzing and holds gorgeous curls all day!</li>
    <li> Perfect for fine hair but company needs to make a travel size.  What am I going to do when I need to board a plane?</li>
    <li> Broken! Could not dispense. Mousse</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever. Smells great and works great.</li>
    <li> very good mousse,  long lasting,  you just need a small amount to get the effect you want and need.</li>
