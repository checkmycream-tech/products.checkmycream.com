      <li>have used this cream for many years.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy at all and has a nice light, clean scent.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice much scent, but it goes on easily, quickly, feels great</li>
      <li>I can see a difference in hydration and helping the fine lines or wrinkles fade.  </li>
      <li>It is light and absorbs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Liked the old formula better.</li>
      <li>My face has a lovely glow and resilience to it since first using this product.</li>
      <li>I originally received a container as part of a door prize at some event.  </li>
      <li>Rejuvenating is right!</li>
      <li>This Arbonne cream smells light and pretty and does not cause me to break out.  </li>
      <li>Love how gentle it is for my sensitive skin.  </li>

      <li>Very sad because this was the first time I experienced this with buying from Amazon.</li>
      <li>It kept my skin from blistering, kept it soft</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is still thick, but a much smaller amount gives nice coverage, so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re skimping.  </li>
      <li>Since the choices are limited when going through radiation, this product came highly recommended for sensitive skin (the Oncology Pharmacy stocks it).  </li>
      <li>I have now switched to Arbonne for my face, because not only do I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have fairly middle of the road skin, so can&#x27;t comment on how it would do with other skin types, but I can only imagine that it would be fabulous for dry skin.  </li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t actually try it for a year as I&#x27;m not really a &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; person, but once I did I was hooked.  </li>
<li> I have eczema/ atopic dermatitis and generally cannot use face creams without irritating my very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> , it is also very dry.  </li>
<li> It is a day or night cream, not too heavy.</li>
<li> It is wonderfully thick and moisturizing without leaving heavy or greasy feel.  </li>
<li> I did not have a reaction to the cream but not sure yet, how emollient it will be in the long-run.</li>
<li> Even my lips have been great this year and it has been a terrible cold year in the midwest.  </li>
<li> Last time I got the R9 nighttime moisturizer, which was too expensive, and because of the thick texture, I went through it too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I was a little reluctant to continue buying this product because of the cost but every time I have tried another product I was unhappy.  </li>

    <li> Love this product. However the last time I bought this product it was not the same product as mentioned. Very sad because this was the first time I experienced this with buying from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for very sensitive skin,great moisturizer and never caused blimishes. The biggest selling point for me is that animals are never used for testing products.</li>

I also use it on the back of my hands and having just turned 40 feel that it has helped them to age more gracefully ;-).  I believe it is intended to be used as a night cream, but I have started putting it on in the morning, wait for it to sink in, and then putting on my make-up.  It has made a great base.</li>
    <li> This is the only review that I have ever done for a product.  I started using this cream when my Oncologist recommended it when I was in radiation therapy for breast cancer.  It was fantastic!  It kept my skin from blistering, kept it soft and I really think it helped heal after radiation was completed.  Since the choices are limited when going through radiation, this product came highly recommended for sensitive skin (the Oncology Pharmacy stocks it).  I have now switched to Arbonne for my face, because not only do I have sensitive skin, it is also very dry.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Liked the old formula better.</li>
    <li> After I began using this cream for about six months, people started complimenting me on my complexion. I love this cream. It is a day or night cream, not too heavy. Makes your skin feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this cream for many years.</li>
    <li> I have eczema/ atopic dermatitis and generally cannot use face creams without irritating my very dry, sensitive skin.  This Arbonne cream smells light and pretty and does not cause me to break out.  It&#x27;s very hydrating and soothing.</li>
    <li> I love Arbonne products.  I have been using for the last 10 years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  The only product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  Even my lips have been great this year and it has been a terrible cold year in the midwest.  Highly recommend any of their products!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Use it 1- 2 times a day.  My face isndry so this is a great product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the way this moisturizer makes my skin feel.  It is not greasy at all and has a nice light, clean scent.  I was a little reluctant to continue buying this product because of the cost but every time I have tried another product I was unhappy.  I am sticking with Arbonne cream!</li>
    <li> Huge fan!  Love how gentle it is for my sensitive skin.  I can see a difference in hydration and helping the fine lines or wrinkles fade.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Love it has used og for many years</li>
    <li> The Arbonne Intelligence line has never failed me. This cream is awesome, I use this once a day after cleansing on my face and neck. Rejuvenating is right! My face has a lovely glow and resilience to it since first using this product. It is light and absorbs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth every Arbonne product I&#x27;ve ever tried has given me excellent results.</li>
    <li> it heals sores. It makes my face feel wonderful and if I burn myself with - say a curling iron it takes the pain and scar away !!!</li>
    <li> Quite nice moisturizing cream.  Works well during the day, or at bedtime.  Recommended it to my daughter and friend.</li>
    <li> Have just used the cream once.  I did not have a reaction to the cream but not sure yet, how emollient it will be in the long-run.</li>
    <li> It is the best skin mois7urizer and wrinkle preventer that I have found.  So many products say they do what this moisturizer does. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this daily moisturizer for all seasons.</li>
