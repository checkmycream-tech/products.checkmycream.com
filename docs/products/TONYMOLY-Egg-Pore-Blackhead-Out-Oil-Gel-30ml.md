      <li>It smells amazing</li>
      <li>Love it super cute have two would buy more!!!</li>
      <li>I love Tony Moly products, including their beautiful packaging, but the egg series in particular has one issue.</li>
      <li>By the way, I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything, and I&#x27;m always ok with Tony Moly products.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this oil gel.</li>
      <li>The product itself is cute, but I don&#x27;t see any result on blackhead out.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to use it.</li>
      <li>The package is cute.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>try some famous brand which I should do</li>
      <li>The bottle is cute, but no any result i can see from this product.</li>
      <li>Smells really good, doesn&#x27;t do much else.</li>
      <li>really cheap stuff turns out.  </li>
      <li>Used right after the shower, wondered if after use exfoliating or more prep would&#x27;ve helped it work.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this c:</li>
      <li>No matter what, I never saw significant results like the photos, it just gave me a softer nose for a day probably from massaging it with an oil.</li>
      <li>love this so much!</li>
      <li>On a clean face, I use it to help re-hydrate my skin at night before applying moisturizer.</li>
      <li>With clean hands, I dip a finger into it and dab a pea sized amount on my forehead, chin.</li>
      <li>The container is cute, but unnecessarily large.</li>
      <li>Make sure to really &amp;#34;get</li>
      <li>This is a surprisingly cool product  </li>
      <li>My pores were smaller and my skin felt good.</li>
      <li>very well i feel like it just makes my nose more oily still see blackheads</li>
      <li>This product is amazing and not only removed my blackheads but seemed to minimize my pore.</li>
      <li>I saw this and thought it&#x27;d be worth a try; however, I didn&#x27;t see any results after using this.</li>
      <li>Nothing special about the gel--It does have a (good) peculiar smell, and it does leave my face slightly oily afterwards.</li>
      <li>Wait 5-7 minutes and wash it with luke warm water as you massage it and dab it dry.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to try again, you don&#x27;t get very much for the price</li>
      <li>My favorite was that I thoroughly clean my nose and leave it wet (not soaking).</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t quite work for you, try to use it after hot tub, and you will see the effect ;)</li>
      <li>Actually Garnier blackhead scrub works better than this one.</li>
      <li>It does EXACTLY as it says.  </li>
      <li>My first day using it</li>
      <li>The only reason this is getting 3 stars is because the packaging is uber cute, it has a fantastic sweet-citrus scent, and it left my skin feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a reduction in my pores at all.</li>
      <li>It seems that I have very stubborn blackheads on my nose.</li>
      <li>The gel is only filled in the bottom compartment, 1/4 of the container.</li>
      <li>My daughter wants me to give her the egg when I finished using it.</li>
      <li>It wiped out my blackhead and whitehead completely the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>I bought this mainly for the mini blackheads on my nose</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more when I go back in October</li>
      <li>no significant better than others.</li>
      <li>When you unscrew the egg  and lift up the removable divider lying on top of the product (which I put back on after each use) you see a clear pudding material with tiny beads incorporated within.</li>
      <li>But east to use and made my skin very soft</li>
      <li>It clearly states in the instructions that its s face wash...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been having clear skin.  </li>
      <li>It leaves you skin feeling soft afterwards but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my blackheads.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it completely gets rid of blackheads</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any difference on my nose so far</li>
      <li>I really love TonyMoly products, but when I opened it I was expecting it to be a thick goo.</li>
      <li>, it feels super refreshing and the packaging is adorable; but aside from that, what I like about this product is - even though it doesn&#x27;t stop the appearance of black heads (unfortunately) - it slow down the reproduction of black heads, so I no longer have as much as before.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s genuine or not.</li>
      <li>as far as just put it on, massage, then rinse- its not a miracle instant</li>
      <li>I got it much faster than I expected.</li>
      <li>Maybe using the real egg white helps way more than this lame product.</li>
      <li>This one is not worth that much.</li>
      <li>I bought a few TONYMOLY products and although I think the packaging is absolutely adorable, the results are not very effective.</li>

<li> I bought a few TONYMOLY products and although I think the packaging is absolutely adorable, the results are not very effective.</li>
<li> I use it after bath/shower when the pores are soft and open, and the gel cleans out all the black heads and also exfoliates my skin, basically it works like chemical exfoliation.</li>
<li> This gel didn&#x27;t turn white when it reacted with the sebum on my face as promised; it turned white when it came into contact with wet skin.</li>
<li> After a few seconds of massaging it into my skin, it would turn clear again.</li>
<li> I was so excited to recieve this gel, since I get clogged pores pretty badly in my T zone, but I have to say it was a bit of a let down.</li>
<li> This little egg actually save my skin</li>
<li> and I tried to use this product a few ways to make it work (i.e. dry skin the wash, wet skin then wash, switch the timing).</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to the fact that I was using it 3 times day for 1 week, but yes it dries out my skin and that caused it to break out....</li>
<li> While I did notice a difference in the amount of blackheads I had around my nose area it caused breakouts on every other part of my face.</li>
<li> It works just like other blackhead out oil.</li>
<li> Only TOO SLOW in Logistics.</li>
<li> I use it twice a week on my nose and my pores are less noticeable.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
<li> One of the few products that I will purchase again.</li>
<li> what a waste of money.</li>
<li> Egg containers are hard to close and it makes you spill and waste the product and create mess.</li>
<li> After, I wash it off and apply a moisturizer as usual.</li>
<li> Just shipping is slow.</li>
<li> I had a serious ploblem with blackheads around my lips and</li>
<li> when its arrived the pack is broken somehow.</li>
<li> I thought that maybe I got &amp;#34;a bad one&amp;#34;, but then saw other reviewers complaining about their eggs as well.</li>
<li> Pore strips do not work for me either :(</li>
<li> - It dries out my skin. :(</li>

    <li> I really love TonyMoly products, but when I opened it I was expecting it to be a thick goo. I had the gold Egg and it was a solid cream, but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this c:</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference on my nose so far</li>
    <li> Stuff works. I use it twice a week on my nose and my pores are less noticeable. I wouldn&#x27;t say it completely gets rid of blackheads but it does help.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and not only removed my blackheads but seemed to minimize my pore.</li>
    <li> I use it after bath/shower when the pores are soft and open, and the gel cleans out all the black heads and also exfoliates my skin, basically it works like chemical exfoliation. The price is good, and the product is amazing! I use it 1-3 times per week, and one package lasts for about 7-8 months.&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t quite work for you, try to use it after hot tub, and you will see the effect ;)</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think this works very well i feel like it just makes my nose more oily still see blackheads</li>
    <li> what a waste of money. Maybe using the real egg white helps way more than this lame product. I did not see any changes.</li>

    <li> Worked for my guy, he said &amp;#34;a little&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference with me. Used right after the shower, wondered if after use exfoliating or more prep would&#x27;ve helped it work.&lt;br /&gt;But as far as just put it on, massage, then rinse- its not a miracle instant cure.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try again, you don&#x27;t get very much for the price but hopefully I&#x27;ll see some results.</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t help. It did not help me or anyone in my family, and we followed the instructions perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a surprisingly cool product  It works.  Check it out.</li>
    <li> really cheap stuff turns out.  not working at all. when its arrived the pack is broken somehow. don&#x27;t waste your money on it. try some famous brand which I should do</li>
    <li> The bottle is cute, but no any result i can see from this product.</li>
    <li> love this so much! its been 2 days and already my pores are noticebly smaller!</li>
    <li> My first day using it I felt a difference. My pores were smaller and my skin felt good. Overall I may buy this again after I&#x27;ve used it all up.</li>
    <li> The seller is good. I got it much faster than I expected. The product itself is cute, but I don&#x27;t see any result on blackhead out.</li>
    <li> I use this about 4-5 times a week and I&#x27;ve been having clear skin.  This product works well with my oily complexion.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil gel. On a clean face, I use it to help re-hydrate my skin at night before applying moisturizer. When you unscrew the egg  and lift up the removable divider lying on top of the product (which I put back on after each use) you see a clear pudding material with tiny beads incorporated within. With clean hands, I dip a finger into it and dab a pea sized amount on my forehead, chin. and cheek areas. Then, I massage it all over my face for 3 minutes and then let it sit for an additional 5-10 minutes. After, I wash it off and apply a moisturizer as usual. It smells amazing and I definitely notice the improvement it has made on my combination skin. The beads help remove the blackheads while the oil gel helps replenish goodness into the crevices! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it super cute have two would buy more!!!</li>
    <li> The product is good. Just shipping is slow.</li>
    <li> I saw this and thought it&#x27;d be worth a try; however, I didn&#x27;t see any results after using this.</li>
    <li> never worked when I  use  it all!</li>
    <li> Not as big as it looks. The gel is only filled in the bottom compartment, 1/4 of the container.</li>
    <li> Smells really good, doesn&#x27;t do much else.</li>
    <li> This little egg actually save my skin some how. Only TOO SLOW in Logistics.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders.  I had a serious ploblem with blackheads around my lips and o my nose. They are all gone using this product twice a week.  My skin also feels great</li>
    <li> The package is cute. My daughter wants me to give her the egg when I finished using it. It works just like other blackhead out oil. no significant better than others. Actually Garnier blackhead scrub works better than this one. It sold at the price $7.50 in walmart, and it is 5OZ which is 5 times compare to this egg. This one is not worth that much.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this did anything at all. I got it to work on the blackheads on my nose. The container is cute, but unnecessarily large.</li>
    <li> Pros - I&#x27;d tried using this product by itself for 1 week (routinely) and yes, it smells great, it feels super refreshing and the packaging is adorable; but aside from that, what I like about this product is - even though it doesn&#x27;t stop the appearance of black heads (unfortunately) - it slow down the reproduction of black heads, so I no longer have as much as before. Another thing that I notice when I use this product is my nose doesn&#x27;t get as oily throughout the day, like it used to be when I used the 3 Steps Proactiv system (2 years and going strong!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - It dries out my skin. :( I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to the fact that I was using it 3 times day for 1 week, but yes it dries out my skin and that caused it to break out....*sigh*. But! I have Proactiv to back me up. So, I&#x27;ve been using this product along side with Proactiv diligently for 2 weeks now, and surprise! Surprise! It balances everything out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: One of the few products that I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> While I did notice a difference in the amount of blackheads I had around my nose area it caused breakouts on every other part of my face. I will use this only occasionally on my nose.</li>
    <li> This works GREAT.  It does EXACTLY as it says.  I bought this in Korea (not Amazon) from Tony Moly.  Massage it (don&#x27;t just let it sit) the entire time (about 3-5 mins).  Wash off and you will see a great difference.  I also use the cooling tightening pack after. Will definitely buy more when I go back in October (it&#x27;s cheaper there).</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. It wiped out my blackhead and whitehead completely the first time I used it. I will definitely recommend this product to people who has problem with blackhead and/or whitehead around their nose area.</li>
    <li> I cannot understand why all the reviews say its a primer when its not. It clearly states in the instructions that its s face wash...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. It doesn&#x27;t work great as they say. But east to use and made my skin very soft</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. It seems that I have very stubborn blackheads on my nose. Pore strips do not work for me either :(</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Not sure if it&#x27;s genuine or not.</li>
    <li> It leaves you skin feeling soft afterwards but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my blackheads.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about the gel--It does have a (good) peculiar smell, and it does leave my face slightly oily afterwards.</li>
    <li> The product came open and leaked all over the inside of the box. I wasn&#x27;t even able to use it.</li>
    <li> Not see the difference</li>
    <li> I bought a few TONYMOLY products and although I think the packaging is absolutely adorable, the results are not very effective. I bought this mainly for the mini blackheads on my nose and I tried to use this product a few ways to make it work (i.e. dry skin the wash, wet skin then wash, switch the timing). My favorite was that I thoroughly clean my nose and leave it wet (not soaking). Then, I take this product and keep massaging it for about 2 minutes. Make sure to really &amp;#34;get it in there&amp;#34;. Get in all the pores and massage under the nose as well. Wait 5-7 minutes and wash it with luke warm water as you massage it and dab it dry. No matter what, I never saw significant results like the photos, it just gave me a softer nose for a day probably from massaging it with an oil. I will not be repurchasing.</li>
