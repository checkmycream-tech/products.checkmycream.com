      <li>Love this spicy and powdery perfume!</li>
      <li>Amazing scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s spicy, but there are floral and vanilla undertones which balance out the scent nicely.</li>
      <li>This is the best frangrance of my whole 68 years of life......</li>

      <li>Got a sample of this from Ulta and was so excited because I loved the notes.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I get many complements when I wear it.</li>
      <li>MORE AN MORE...</li>
      <li>I LOVE the scent of this one</li>
      <li>they said that they would not be able to resell it, because i had used it, but they would be able to reduce the fee to just 20% restocking fee.  </li>
      <li>WHAT I LOVE ABOUT</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Love, love, love, love!&amp;#34;  Please make &amp; carry accompanying &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>EVERY time I wear it people stop me and ask what I am wearing and say how they really love it..</li>
      <li>imperial world insisted that i had used the product, and they would no longer be able to sell it.  </li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Shipping available in Canada!</li>
      <li>This fragrance also lasts longer on my skin than most perfumes, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I was happy to be able to find it on Amazon still and bought the big bottle!</li>
      <li>It is not overbearing, but present - and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>they told me they compared the perfume to others they had in stock and deemed it to be perfectly fine and that i was required to pay the 20%.  </li>
      <li>first experienced it via the sample in Oprah&#x27;s magazine....and from the get go, I was really surprised at how it captured my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
      <li>When it was first introduced on a shopping Network I purchased it and now my favorite retailer in the World Sells it AMAZON.</li>
      <li>quick shipping and item as described</li>
      <li>also i wrote a quick response to amazon on their satisfaction survey</li>
      <li>but i didn&#x27;t mind because, to me, it would be worth it.</li>
      <li>THIS SMELL IS THAT IT VERY Easily SMELLS DIFF ON THE NEXT PERSON....</li>
      <li>Very, very animalic.</li>
      <li>VERY REASONABLE PRICE ALSO...</li>
      <li>perhaps a different &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; would have been better.  </li>
      <li>I am just about out of my last bottle and wish I had purchased more.</li>
      <li>I have a difficult time finding a fragrance that I can wear and this is awesome.</li>
      <li>AT FIRST</li>
      <li>I had originally purchased the small bottle and loved it so much that I came back for the large one!</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for Boyfriend (there&#x27;s a metaphor in there, somewhere)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend purchasing this.</li>
      <li>I loved the concept of this perfume, but it was just musky &amp; dusty with no interest.</li>
      <li>MY NEW SIGNATURE SMELL...</li>
      <li>Purchased 3 bottles so far!</li>
      <li>i paid much more than i usually do for this fragrance</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not at all as masculine as I&#x27;d feared.</li>
      <li>It is soft and feminine without being overly floral-y.</li>
      <li>so that was an $85 lesson as far as i can tell.  </li>
      <li>It reminds me of reading a book by the fire with a soft blanket in the winter and of summer picnics on sunny days.</li>
      <li>This matches my body chemistry like no other.</li>
      <li>Definitely something that can be worn everyday or just for special occasions.</li>

<li> imperial world immediately emailed me asking me if they refunded the last $25 would i take back my negative review.  </li>
<li> the whole experience was frustrating.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately this stuff was pure funk to me.</li>
<li> but I think it smells like the worst kind of drugstore perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because if you&#x27;re looking for an all day fragrance, you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
<li> but alas it (he) let me down...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find.</li>
<li> I am almost reluctant to write this review, I almost want to keep it as my little secret.</li>
<li> we all know how perfume can turn bad when it is heated or kept too long.  </li>
<li> so sorry</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it lasts a loong time.  </li>
<li> So sad they aren&#x27;t making it anymore :</li>
<li> and i told them i was unhappy.  </li>
<li> i sent them a scathing email pointing out the fact that if i use one squirt of the perfume it is considered used and unsellable, but they are comparing it to others they have in stock and those somehow are sellable.</li>
<li> So sad it&#x27;s been discontinued. :-(</li>
<li> So disappointed she decided to stop making it.</li>

    <li> first experienced it via the sample in Oprah&#x27;s magazine....and from the get go, I was really surprised at how it captured my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Soft alluring and lots of compliments! Wished I had purchased two bottle before the price went up 50%!  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. I have a difficult time finding a fragrance that I can wear and this is awesome. I get many complements when I wear it.</li>
    <li> wonderful item. This was a big hit with my wife for christmas.</li>
    <li> I liked this fragrance more than I thought I would. It&#x27;s not at all as masculine as I&#x27;d feared. It&#x27;s spicy, but there are floral and vanilla undertones which balance out the scent nicely. This fragrance also lasts longer on my skin than most perfumes, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It is soft and feminine without being overly floral-y. It reminds me of reading a book by the fire with a soft blanket in the winter and of summer picnics on sunny days. Each and every time I have worn it someone has commented on how good I smell. I had originally purchased the small bottle and loved it so much that I came back for the large one! I am almost reluctant to write this review, I almost want to keep it as my little secret.</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume scent ever!  It&#x27;s getting hard to find.</li>
    <li> My very favorite but found they are discontinuing it................so sorry</li>
    <li> The loveliest, sexiest perfume I have ever worn.  It is not overbearing, but present - and beautiful.  So sad it&#x27;s been discontinued. :-(</li>
    <li> This is the best frangrance of my whole 68 years of life......EVERY time I wear it people stop me and ask what I am wearing and say how they really love it..I am a spicy perfume person and this is beyond perfect....Just think Ladies, I am 68 and men still stop and sniff and rave about it...Thank you Kate Walsh...</li>
    <li> I SMELLED THIS AT FIRST ON MY WRIST, SMELLED LIKE PATCHOULI TO ME, OR ON ME ANYWAY...AS TIME WENT ON, I LOVED IT MORE AN MORE...VERY REASONABLE PRICE ALSO...MY NEW SIGNATURE SMELL...WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS SMELL IS THAT IT VERY Easily SMELLS DIFF ON THE NEXT PERSON....SO NO ONE WILL SMELL THE SAME, NOT EVEN YOUR TWIN SISTER...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. So sad they aren&#x27;t making it anymore : (</li>
    <li> Amazing scent. Shipping available in Canada! Will re-purchase when done.</li>
    <li> Love this spicy and powdery perfume! I wear it every day and never tire of it.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love, love, love, love!&amp;#34;  Please make &amp; carry accompanying &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; pieces to this fragrance. I don&#x27;t even want to smell the newest scent called &amp;#34;Billionaire&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the scent of this one however, the fragrance dissipates within 2-3 hours.  A bit pricey to not last longer in my opinion at $89.  Eau de Parfum was the only option I had so perhaps a different &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; would have been better.  Someone mentioned the scent was being discontinued so maybe that&#x27;s why.  All that being said it still smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> i have purchased this product before and loved it.  i paid much more than i usually do for this fragrance but i didn&#x27;t mind because, to me, it would be worth it. when i received it, the smell and colour where way off.  we all know how perfume can turn bad when it is heated or kept too long.  imperial world insisted that i had used the product, and they would no longer be able to sell it.  but they would honor a return based on their return policy, which stated that i was required to pay a 20% restocking fee as well as a 20% international fee.  i asked them to reconsider that, because i would have loved to have kept the perfume but it was unusable.  they said that they would not be able to resell it, because i had used it, but they would be able to reduce the fee to just 20% restocking fee.  i again asked them to reconsider that and they told me that they would let me know when they received the item.  i had tracked the item and it had been returned to them for almost two weeks when i finally emailed them to see what was happening.  they told me they compared the perfume to others they had in stock and deemed it to be perfectly fine and that i was required to pay the 20%.  so altogether i paid $160 (including exchange and shipping both ways) and i got a $75 refund. so that was an $85 lesson as far as i can tell.  also i wrote a quick response to amazon on their satisfaction survey and i told them i was unhappy.  imperial world immediately emailed me asking me if they refunded the last $25 would i take back my negative review.  i sent them a scathing email pointing out the fact that if i use one squirt of the perfume it is considered used and unsellable, but they are comparing it to others they have in stock and those somehow are sellable. the whole experience was frustrating.  i have found myself a new scent - donna karan, cashmere mist - its delicious..</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn. I&#x27;ve never had so many complements on how wonderful I smell! Not overpowering and very sexy. Definitely something that can be worn everyday or just for special occasions. I highly recommend purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!  I have used it since Kate Walsh introduced it. So disappointed she decided to stop making it.</li>
    <li> I am just about out of my last bottle and wish I had purchased more. This matches my body chemistry like no other. Everywhere I go I&#x27;m asked &amp;#34;What is that you&#x27;re wearing? Or my word you smell great and my friend gave me a greeting by hugs and said boy you always smell sooo- goood!!! It&#x27;s the only Parfum I wear now. When it was first introduced on a shopping Network I purchased it and now my favorite retailer in the World Sells it AMAZON. I have one question though, I have the 50 ML / 1.7 FL oz bottle and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. Did she drop an ounce from this? Because I can only find the 1.6 oz size now for the same price as the 1.7 oz size? Does anyone know what happened to the 50 ML Size 1.7 FL oz??</li>
    <li> Love it! Purchased 3 bottles so far!</li>
    <li> quick shipping and item as described</li>
    <li> This has been my go-to fragrance for a year or so, but it has been discontinued. I was happy to be able to find it on Amazon still and bought the big bottle!</li>
    <li> A perfect mix of masculine and feminine in a bottle. Perfection.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for Boyfriend (there&#x27;s a metaphor in there, somewhere) but alas it (he) let me down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me, the vanilla is underwhelming, and there&#x27;s an unpleasant aftershavey spicy fragrance on top.  Unfortunately, it lasts a loong time.  YMMV, but I think it smells like the worst kind of drugstore perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because if you&#x27;re looking for an all day fragrance, you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this from Ulta and was so excited because I loved the notes. Unfortunately this stuff was pure funk to me. Very, very animalic. I loved the concept of this perfume, but it was just musky &amp; dusty with no interest.</li>
