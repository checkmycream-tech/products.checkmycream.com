      <li>This perfume is absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>:) Sporty and fresh</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too loud and kind of sporty</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m normally very picky with my scents and am much more a fan of fruity than I am floral.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fresh scent, and of course it takes on the body chemistry of the person wearing it too.</li>
      <li>This one combines grapefruit and white lotus, and it smells lovely.</li>

      <li>last pretty ok, like morning till night, 8 hours i think.</li>
      <li>and top is on in such a way you can&#x27;t transfer to different sprayer.</li>
      <li>I love it when an eau de toilette isn&#x27;t entirely floral or entirely fruity but a combination of both.</li>
      <li>Also long lasting and cute bottle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet and fresh and it is very long lasting.</li>
      <li>The bottle was larger than I expected, I got a lot more perfume for the money.  </li>
      <li>Love this smell, very fresh and uplifting, smells expensive.</li>
