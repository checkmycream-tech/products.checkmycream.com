<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Expensive for the amount you get. The conditioner smells nice though but nothing special.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner with the shampoo for over a week now and love it.  Makes my hair very soft and shiny.  It does not leave any kind of residue. I love that is 100% organic too.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is incredible and the best I have ever used.  My hair hasn&#x27;t been in this good of shape/condition  since I can&#x27;t remember when. I use both the shampoo and conditioner and so far I can&#x27;t believe the results!!  Thank you Christina!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner!  I have oily hair and can use this as a leave in conditioner on the ends of my hair where its a little drier. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and have searched endlessly for a good conditioner that actually makes my hair feel soft after I rinse it out.  This did just that!  It felt so silky after I rinsed it out and smells lovely.  I had a feeling this would work for me based on reading the reviews, and I was correct.  Also, just a little is needed -- a little goes a long way.  I am very happy!  Beautiful bottle too.  Definitely a quality product.</li>
    <li> FINALLY! I was looking for a natural/organic conditioner that works and this guys is amazing. I have fine, dry and frizzy hair. It does magic. You need to use just a tiny amount for a huge results. Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> Smells good, works okay. It&#x27;s a pretty small bottle for the price though.</li>
    <li> I like it and love it!  This is the best conditioner I have used and I am very satisfied with the product, I highly recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I am more than satisfied with the Christina Moss Naturals Conditioner.  I have used this product for over a month and it has more than exceeded my expectations for a conditioner.  I live in Arizona, a very dry and windy environment.  I am outside most of the time.  I have waist length hair that ends up with a lot of static electricity.  Your recommendation to use the conditioner as a leave-on product  worked well.  I rinse the conditioner out of my hair, then take a small amount before I get out of the shower, rub it between my hands, then apply to the ends of my hair.  It has worked great and I enjoy the light fragrance.  Best of all, it is Organic!  I appreciate the follow-up.  I also purchased the shampoo which has turned out to be a great product.  I will order both again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Great follow up to the shampoo. Very rich and creamy. A little goes a long way! I have short hair so I don&#x27;t use it for tangles, but for conditioning of my scalp and keep my hair healthy. It does a great job!</li>
    <li> I had ordered a previous version from the seller.  I was alright; nothing to write home about.  The seller responded to my review and offered to send out their current product (that at the time was new) and what an improvement!  Conditioner has a very mild scent and conditions my hair.  It&#x27;s organic and healthy, helps alleviate the dry scalp I used to have.  Very happy with product AND seller.  Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Awesome conditioner! Bought for my boy with autism, after look for a gluten free-casein free- all natural conditioner for a long, long time. He absolutely loves it! It smells very subtle but awesome. Leaves his hair so soft and rinse easily, which is great when your kid doesn&#x27;t like to be touched too much while showering &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought both shampoo and conditioner, and after seeing the results, I´m now a loyal customer! Also, the customer service is just amazing.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product! Natural ingredients make a world of difference when using on your hair, body, etc. Buy this--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner along with their shampoo...  I am amazed at how little I have to use for my extremely baby fine hair that tangles when it gets wet. This conditioner leaves my hair combably soft. I also have color treated hair, this product does not fade my color either.  I am on my fourth bottle and have no plans of ever stopping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over the last few months now.  I love them.  The subtle organic smell of Lavender and Licorice, which are both Organic preservatives.  I like that it is concentrated, and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot. Most of the high-end lines are that way and this is no exception.  I feel my hair doesn&#x27;t shed as much in using this shampoo and conditioner and the conditioner works great!  And the soap bar is moisturizing!  I&#x27;ll be continuing to use these products daily.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. Smells great also but  I wish it were cheaper and had a larger size. Although a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 2 year old and love it.  I love that it smooths like a conditioner should and it&#x27;s organic.  It helps take out her tangles, which make both her and I happy.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this conditioner and shampoo. THe shampoo left my hair squeaky clean but extremely tangled. I did not think this condition was going to be able to help me. I put about a tablespoon in my hand (I have short hair) and went to work on the knots. To my surprise, it took the tangles right out and I realized I did an overkill on the amount of conditioner I used. I did it again tonight and used about a dime size of conditioner and it handled my tangles without any effort from me. My hair is soft and silky. I am in love with this product and company!</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!!!  I have been searching for over a year for a natural, organic shampoo and conditioner that work -- leaving my coarse, color-treated, caucasian hair looking and feeling good -- Christina Moss Naturals is it!  I have tried so many organic shampoos and conditioners that didn&#x27;t work for me -- they were either too heavy, didn&#x27;t lather, were overly fragranced, irritated my sensitive scalp, left my hair feeling and looking dried out, etc).  I am so happy I decided to try this product -- my search is over.  I also am beyond thrilled that since using these Christina Moss products, I have no scalp itch -- something I have battled and which had been driving me crazy for over a year.  Thank you for a fantastic conditioner -- and shampoo.  Should&#x27;ve come to this brand first since I love the Christina Moss facial moisturizer as well.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Love it and a little goes a long way.  I have fine hair but never leaves it looking or feeling greasy. I use it daily and would highly recommend.  I have tried a lot of products on the market this is far superior.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.  I use the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> just ok, nothing special for the price. I find as long as I don&#x27;t wash my hair any conditioner is good.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this conditioner.  Covers well with just a bit.  It feels like it&#x27;s not rinsing out and I was concerned it would feel heavy and look oily but that hasn&#x27;t been the case.  My hair is soft, healthy, shiny.  Very happy with the performance of this product.</li>
    <li> I am 62 years old, and have been experimenting for quite some time with different hair products, to make my long, dark hair look like it used to when I was in my 20&#x27;s. I have avoided products with sulfates in them, and dimethicone, or other ingredients that are not good for one&#x27;s hair. I also stopped using any shampoo on my hair - just conditioners. Since I stopped using shampoo - and by the way, I will NOT use baking soda on my hair, it is too damaging - I have noticed that my hair is a lot darker, and I have a lot fewer gray hairs sprouting. In the course of my quest for a great hair product, I have tried the Moroccan Argan oil conditioners, co-wash conditioners, biotin conditioners, coconut oil conditioners, etc., etc., etc. This could be a long, long list, so I have just given you a few of the conditioners I have tried.  Today, I used JUST water, and the Christina Moss Naturals Conditioner. My scalp felt clean, and my hair is shiny, bouncy, and manageable. Mind you, I just used it for the first time, today - a few hours ago. My first impression is - WOW! After I have used it for awhile, I shall come back and update my review, but for now - I simply love it!  UPDATE: JANUARY 27, 2015 - Two days ago, I shampooed my hair with the original Miracle II soap and water, used NO conditioner, and when my hair was dry, simply put a nickel-sized drop of this conditioner on the palm of my hand, rubbed my hands together, and ran them through the ends of my hair. My hair is shiny, and silky - very pleased!   UPDATE: APRIL 4, 2015 - I now, wash my hair, dry it, and THEN use the conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> I bought the conditioner with the shampoo.  As soon as I put it on my hair, I knew it would be a good product for my hair type, which is curly and dry.  It left it feeling very soft, not greasy or heavy. It has a nice, natural smell and rinses well and leaves very little odor.</li>
    <li> Very nice conditioner, although leaves a film on the hair that lifts out on the next day or so.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner for my daughter, she has long hair. I was hoping that would be much easier to comb, but the miracle did not happen. Perhaps a little more used, try on.</li>
    <li> Pro: seems to work well for my fine, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Con: quite expensive for the amount. So surprised by size of bottle when arrived. My own fault not seeing only 8oz for  $18.99.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Instantly put moisture back in hair after shampooing, a little goes a long way. Even added a little afte getting out it the shower. Love that this is truly organic and handmade. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> Love it. Such a good smell and works so well. My previous experience with natyral products was that these would not untangle my long hair and leave it smooth but this one did. Also my kids love it too.</li>
    <li> As I said with the Shampoo, I am quite picky as my hair can be difficult at times (combo oily/dry) I like this conditioner as it works, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and leaves my hair manageable</li>
    <li> Best conditioner we&#x27;ve ever tried for smooth silky de-tangled hair!  And it doesn&#x27;t contain all the nasty toxins either. Super.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a 2 year quest to remove toxic products from my life.  Gone are all polishes perfumes make up brands I used for 20 years.  This product is fantastic!  I use the conditioner in the shower and when I let my hair dry naturally, I use a little as a leave in product.  The shampoo is the only one I&#x27;ll use bc it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural oils.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo with no sulfa and also organic. Initially I was skeptical about this product but i must say that I like it. The only recommendation I have is that the conditioner smells really good but the shampoo is a bit blank.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the shower and after as a leave-in and it has felt good on my scalp.</li>
    <li> This was my first bottle of organic conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It&#x27;s definitely not a large bottle but a little bit goes a long way. I loved the directions that I got from the company saying that I could even keep some of the conditioner in my hair! The only thing that I would like to see improved is the price.</li>
    <li> This conditioner didn&#x27;t make my hair feel any softer. It just made it greasy and weighed down. It is not worth the price. Small bottle with garbage results.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural (none of the bad stuff) shampoo &amp; conditioner that I found that actually makes your hair feel wonderful and silky!  Its on the pricey side, but you don&#x27;t need a lot when your using it.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. Sold!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money! I am never satisfied with the organic shampoo and conditioner products I buy, this is the first time (and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT). This is my new shampoo/conditioner from now until they stop making it :)</li>
    <li> I left a review for the shampoo, so I figured I&#x27;d do another for the conditioner. I don&#x27;t mind the 4 oz bottle because it&#x27;s concentrated. This is not an unscented conditioner, but I like the smell, and for me, that&#x27;s saying a lot because I have a low tolerance for scents and perfumes. But that isn&#x27;t enough for me, a conditioner has to really do a good job or I&#x27;ll return it. I won&#x27;t be returning this one, in fact I will order it again because my hair feels nice and thick after I use it.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner.  It smells nice but not overpowering and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This smells and works great.  You don&#x27;t need a lot either so it is a good value and will last quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Perfectly balanced conditioner - not too heavy, not too light. It complements the shampoo well and together they result in really shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the subtle fruity smell but it doesn&#x27;t stick around after you rinse it off. And so far, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be bothering my eczema, but I was surprised that it had a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small, so no bargain here.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. My hair has never looked so healthy, however the bottle is too small. I feel like I need a lot for my long, thick hair. Wish I could buy this in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Finally something which doesn&#x27;t mess up my super sensitive skin and my hair looks great! I love the smell as well</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner!  I love the texture and slip of it.  I tried your suggestion of putting a very small amount on my towel dried hair, and it works like a charm.  Will definitely reuse this product.</li>
    <li> My fiancée has very curly hair, but it was being to thin out. He started using this conditioner and now his hair is healthy again, it looks the best it ever has.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my wife. Driving while in the shower left my hair soft. Even used it on my face before shaving to prep my beard</li>
    <li> The quality of the conditioner degraded significantly with the size of bottles been doubled from 4 to 8oz.  And the same happened to moisturizer &amp; shampoo.  Basically, the products are a lot more watery compared with the earlier ones.  The conditioner used to stick to the bottle, but now it is very runny.  I have to use double amount to get the same effect.  Have used their earlier products, the current ones are very disappointing.  I understand they considered customers&#x27; feedbacks saying the products are small and pricy.  Pricing is only one factor to retain customer, but quality &amp; consistency are what really matter to me.  I could live with paying a little more to get quality products, and that was the reason that I kept going back.  But after tried out their new ones in bigger bottles, I was very hesitated to purchase them again.  Very sad.  I wish I could stay with their products, but I will have to move on.  Hope they could revert back to the original formula.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, just too thick to come out of the squeeze bottle. Had to take the cap off to get the conditioner out, and finally added water so I could keep the cap on!! Also wish the conditioner came in a larger size. Only need to use a little bit of the shampoo (it is thinner), so I use up the conditioner faster than the shampoo!! I like the shampoo and conditioner, but I am still having problems with scalp sores.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I&#x27;ve tried almost every shampoo and conditioner for dry scalp and hair and nothing ever seemed to help. I have only been using it for one week and already I see a big difference! My hair feels and looks so much healthier! Never using anything else from now on.</li>
    <li> My hair has been changing - as often happens later in life - it has become more course and yet is very fine.  I was looking for a product that would not irritate my skin but would make my hair feel and look silky again. Also with fine hair - sometimes by the end of the day you hair can be limp and look like it needs to be washed again - that doesn&#x27;t happen with Christina Moss Conditioner.  In fact there appears to be no residue - and my hair feels clean all day, retains it&#x27;s body and style, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Very happy!  And the larger sized bottle was a bonus.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural shampoo &amp; conditioner for about 2 years now with no success.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff leaves my hair too dry. I tried using more, leaving it on longer, applying more as a leave-in, all with no luck. It left my hair frizzy &amp; oddly curly.&lt;br /&gt;I think people with less course hair would have more success than I did.</li>
    <li> This is the first organic conditioner I&#x27;ve found that leaves my hair manageable and I have super tangly hair.</li>
    <li> Made my hair extra soft. great conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to trying this conditioner. Unfortunately, it does not work on my hair. My son&#x27;s hair, however, is beautiful, soft and so clean. I wish it had worked for me, but I am very happy it works for my son.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair. Unlike some conditioners I&#x27;ve used that leave my hair feeling unnaturally heavily coated, this doesn&#x27;t. Works great in combination with the Christina Moss Naturals shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and leaves my daughters very curly hair very soft and manageable. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I like this hair conditioner a lot. It leaves my hair smooth with a pleasant clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat order for me. I love this shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the first shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had that didn&#x27;t make my scalp break out. I was constantly having to get a medicated shampoo to clear up the rash only to have it return within a few days of stopping the medicated shampoo and returning to my regular shampoo. I was using one I thought was more natural and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different shampoos over the years. This is the only one that has not caused a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the way the shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel and behave. It&#x27;s a win-win for me. Thank you so much for your wonderful products.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. A small amount does a great job. A very superior product.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for my coarse dry hair, but I love the shampoo. Love the fragrance. Works well for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair, moisturizing but not heavy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and it&#x27;s made sucha change in my dry brittle hair. I wash my hair every other day and the night before I wash my hair I just put a tiny bit on the tips of my hair. (That or argan oil). Will be buying more for sure. Only thing I would suggest is larger quantities. I have really long hair and will be running out soon.</li>
    <li> Dried out my hair terribly!</li>
    <li> I used this as a leave in conditioner and it works great.</li>
    <li> its okay have used better natural conditioner that isnt so pricey.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this product gave some body without dulling.  I intend to continue using this conditioner (which I can&#x27;t say for the closet full of shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ll be giving away!).</li>
    <li> For the last couple of years I have struggled to find a product that works, mainly because of all of my skin allergies AND food allergies, so I must say... this is a great product and line!  Finally something I can use without worry!  I&#x27;m very happy I found this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or make it oily like many products do. And I know it is healthy for my hair as well!</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say.......love it</li>
    <li> I applaud the company for its mission and integrity regarding the high quality of its ingredients. But, $20 for 8 oz.? Not worth it. I thought the heading implied that one was getting &amp;#34;twice the amount,&amp;#34; or. 16 oz. I was wrong. Again, $20 for 8 oz? It&#x27;s conditioner, after all...</li>
    <li> but for my long hair too expensive because I need too much of it. Using it for the kids now:-)</li>
    <li> Finally a minimal ingredient hairproduct that actually works like it should and feels like a normal conditioner! Thank you!  But have to lose one star for price of such a small bottle!</li>
    <li> Excellent all natural conditioner for your hair!!  Christina Moss Naturals has produced a wonderful conditioner which leaves hair soft, shiny, healthy and manageable.  You don&#x27;t need much, so a little goes a long way.  I use the Christina Moss organic hair shampoo-a perfect combination!  My hair is soft, clean and nicely conditioned.  I highly recommend both these products for a healthier head of hair with no harmful chemicals.  The company is awesome providing all the information you need to use these products properly.  Wonderful products!</li>
    <li> Small amount works - hair manageable without additional products - when using flat iron, I still use a heat protective shine.&lt;br /&gt;No intense smell, no fragrance, clean minimal components.  Christina Moss, love your product, love your philosophy.  Great customer service, with free download informational book, and nice your tube videos.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks since I have been using this conditioner and it&#x27;s really good.  I just feel better knowing that am putting something good in my head as suppose to chemicals.</li>
    <li> Seriously some of the best conditioner i have ever used.  It applies thicker and easier than most conditioners.  My hair is softer and shinier than it has ever been.  I can tell this is a well thought out product.</li>
    <li> I have very curly long hair and this conditioner does a good job of conditioning and detangling.  I feel good about the ingredients, though there seems to be something in it that makes the scalp near my neck itch a few hours after drying.  I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s a sensitivity I have or if anyone else has had that issue.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are ok k. Not really worth for money</li>
    <li> I used to soak my hair in conditioners. I used Aveda products and now I&#x27;ve changed my ways to the completely natural line of skin &amp; hair care from Christina Moss Naturals. I put a small amount of conditioner in my hair while using her silky glycerin soap and then a smaller amount out of the shower as a leave in for my ends - great idea for longer hair. My new favorite conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, leaves my little ones hair shiny and easy to manage. Smells ok</li>
    <li> Very pricey but it goes a long way.  Washes out easily yet leaves my hair quite manageable.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing!  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get fabulous results!  I can&#x27;t remember my hair ever feeling this soft and healthy.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I have tried so many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products that just left my hair crispy and fly away. This conditioner has a lovely, light, fresh scent. Conditions very nicely and a little goes a long way! I can&#x27;t wait to try the shampoo :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! This is the best conditioner I have ever used, and man have I tried a few. I love that it conditions well, but rinses out easily and does not feel greasy. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used AND it&#x27;s organic.  you literally only need a tiny bit and it goes a long way.  my hair feels smooth and silky.  it gets the tangles out.  works great!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! I use it mainly as a lay in conditioner.  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t grease up your hair like other conditioners do.  I like that it is organic and doesn&#x27;t have the drying or damaging chemicals that other conditioners may contain.  My hair is smooth and shiny and you can definitely feel the difference.  Needless to say, my hair is loving this stuff!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a little pricy but a little goes a long way so it lasts a very long time. I love that it is organic and natural. It makes my hair feel so nice afterwards. It helps detangle so its much easier to comb when I get out of the shower. I would defiantly recommend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my sensitive skin, but when I use this conditioner I always end up having dandruff.  The shampoo from the same company is fine - works great.  Wish this worked as well..</li>
    <li> This conditioner and the shampoo are just amazing!!!! I have been using them for 2 months and my hair feels and looks much better! Highly recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> My hair is fuller and thicker and oh so soft!  You can&#x27;t go wrong! Never could find a shampoo / conditioner that worked on my very fine hair. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> BYER BE AWARE OF THE AMOUNT IN THE BOTTLE!! MAKE SURE YOU ARE LOOKING ON A DEVICE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AT THE OUNCES.&lt;br /&gt;MY MISTAKE, BECAUSE NORMALLY I WOULD NEVER EVER PAY THIS PRICE!! I KNOW THERE ARE LIKE PRODUCTS OUT THERE FOR A MORE AFORDABLE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;AGAIN, MY OUWN FAULT!!</li>
    <li> Really great product!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a light natural cinnamon-orange smell that makes my hair smell pleasant all day. You only need a tiny bit and it glides across your hair. It&#x27;s easy to rinse out, but I like to leave a little bit in to help my hair feel soft all day. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference from using this stuff. I bought the shampoo also and it&#x27;s perfect paired with this. All natural really does make a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for nigh on 3 weeks now, and I&#x27;m in love with it!  I have tried many other &amp;#34;all-natural/organic&amp;#34; products, and none of them work as well as this one.  Other conditioners make my hair feel so smooth and silky that it almost seems unnatural; many also take out what little body my hair has and causes it to lie limp on my shoulders.  This conditioner does neither.  It does make my hair very soft, but not unnaturally so.  It also removes tangles, which is a huge plus for me!  I had problems in the past with &amp;#34;all-natural/organic&amp;#34; products making my already thin hair fall out; not a problem with this conditioner.  Something that I especially like about these two products (shampoo and conditioner) is that they have little to no scent.  This means that I can add my essential oils occasionally without ending up with conflicting smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is the only negative aspect for me.  Organic ingredients have been getting more expensive over the last couple years, and it has hit this company some, but they do their best to &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; the cost increases themselves and not pass them on to the customers.  Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than some other hair products.  While I do always consider price when I decide to (or not to) buy a product, I also know that sometimes better quality is simply more expensive.  In this case, I believe it is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love the conditioner, I love the company even more.  I have e-mailed back and forth with Kenny (the company&#x27;s CEO) quite a few times now, and I am incredibly impressed with his customer service.  E-mails are always answered promptly (some over the weekend!), questions/concerns always addressed, he asked how my experience with the products had gone, he asked how the products/service could be better, and I even received a special discount for my next order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great products!  Excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> I was sceptic at first but decided to purchase the combi package (face cream, face wash, shampoo, conditioner) trying it out. My hair tends to be oily on the roots but dry on the lengths due to highlights. I meanwhile figured that you really do not need much of this product at all. Simply use the size of a dime, distribute it in your hands and then massage it into the lengths. The feeling will be different from what you are used to but just try it out and you will see that it does the job (even better). Yesterday I found out what works is giving it a very quick rinse afterwards and keeping the product partially in the hair as a kind of leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I came from the gym - as always I just quickly blow dryed the hair without any shaping (blowing over a round brush or the likes). Once dry I could not believe how beautiful, shiny and healthy it looked (like my hair without coloring and highlighting). But then I brushed that thought away thinking that my perception is probably completely flawed given how much I spent. Of course I will tend to see a difference if I paid this much money lol. Then I went to lunch (no smile, no asking for compliments face, actually thinking about work) and colleague says &amp;#34;omg, you have such beautiful hair today. Your should really show it off more and carry it open like this more often. Mind you, it was  female colleague. Only then I realized that it is was not only my flawed perception. I t is real!</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review!&lt;br /&gt;Yay for natural hair care that doesn&#x27;t have ARGAN OIL! This is extremely refreshing since it seriously breaks me out! I mean everywhere!!! Also, I recently dyed my hair red so I was skeptical to use anything without red dyes in it but I&#x27;ve actually noticed that it works perfectly fine and doesn&#x27;t make my hair bleed anymore than my color shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Gets my hair clean without over cleaning it and drying it out.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to overdo this conditioner. If I use too much it takes away all the volume in my hair. With the just a dab, it makes my hair feel and smell great! Not sure if I will buy again because of size/price ratio, but I may if I can&#x27;t find something as legit as this.</li>
    <li> Been using this conditioner for a couple weeks.  Great product!  Not too heavy and not too light for my hair.  I have thin hair, but very dry hair.  This conditioner is just right.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s none greasy and do not irritate my scalp like other conditioner. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Alright - I did not like this so much as a conditioner, but as a leave-in this is a very nice product. Light weight and softly scented. A little bit really goes a long way! Good job guys. Very nice product :)</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing! I have just begun my journey in using naturally made products and this hair product is setting my standards high! I am pleasantly surprised that my hair can look so smooth and silky with all natural ingredients. It makes sense I guess... No more harsh chemicals to strip my hair of all that is it meant to be... Natural. My hair is long, quite thin ... And I only need to use about the size of a dime. The conditioner smells amazing! My long thin hair barely tangles now... As it did when I used other conditioners. The customer service is also amazing. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> love it  makes my thin hair feel healthier and thicker</li>
    <li> Stripped my hair, made it unmanageable even with conditioner,  had to get deep conditioner so my hair would be back to normal, it took the shine out of my hair also, I have thin hair, I tried it for two days</li>
    <li> I used the Christina Moss Shampoo and this Conditioner together, and just like the shampoo, I was skeptical as other organic products have either not worked well or had chemical preservatives in them.  This one works very well and has no chemicals at all. I have long hair for a guy and most organic conditioners are a weak substitute for the toxic brands but this organic conditioner does the job. and leaves my hair feeling really nice, full and easy to maintain through-out the day. I also use a tiny amount as a leave in conditioner and that works really well for me. I have very dry hair and after using several of the other products from this line I had high hopes for this conditioner and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but after finishing one bottle of this I figured hey I&#x27;ll get something cheaper my hair is awesome... NOPE my hair went right back to being frizzy and dry with the other conditioner. I miss this conditioner! and I&#x27;m getting another bottle, a bit pricey but works great leaving my curly hair silky soft and bouncy. I recommend using a little as a leave in conditioner after showering.</li>
    <li> The producer might have designed this product for kids. I dislike its candy like sweet smell. To me the sweetness doesn&#x27;t works for ultimate cleanliness. There are too many overly sweet processed foods in US. My favorite bar soap has absolutely no sent of sweetness and is enjoyable during shower. [[ASIN:B00FNXAOCS Defense Soap Bar - 5 Pack]]  I am going to find haircare products without sweetness.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! I wish I could buy it in gallon sizes!! My two daughters and I have dry curly hair. I&#x27;ve been looking for an organic leave in conditioner for years...especially for now for my youngest daughter who doesn&#x27;t like getting her hair town so she&#x27;s usually rockin a fro lol. This conditioner tames her hair and helps bring out the beauty in her little curls. Sadly I can&#x27;t afford to use it on my desperately dry hair because I have A LOT of hair and would go through a bottle in less than a month if I used it regularly or on my older daughters hair because it reaches her lower back...I just use it on our hair when we go out. But for my youngest who has short hair one bottle lasts about 6 months. I will be purchasing more for her soon since she is running low!</li>
    <li> I actually love this. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner. I accidentally bought two bottles of conditioner in the first shipment, instead of a shampoo and conditioner, but that&#x27;s ok because I definitely plan on buying it again, both the shampoo and the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a tiny, tiny little bit to leave my hair silky soft. It says that it can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, which I haven&#x27;t yet tried because I still have left most of a huge bottle of the product that I already use for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course I love that it&#x27;s organic, it&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to find organic hair products.</li>
    <li> This product has lived up to its claims as an effective conditioner that really lasts because not much is needed for each usage.  If you follow the instructions and tips, the same should be true for you.</li>
    <li> Great. I use just a tiny amount as leave-in conditioner since my hair sometimes dries really thick looking.</li>
    <li> Excellent Conditioner ..Hair feels like silk with only a bit of this product..You will love it ..Fast S&amp;H ....Great customer service too..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t give up on natural shampoo (and conditioner) until you try this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying everything out there, including natural, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; (by that I mean it says natural but has hidden chemicals) baking soda, Castile, shampoo bars etc I wanted to give up on my frizzy greasy limp ugly hair. I gave it one more shot and bought this stuff. Purely awesome! It saved my hair which was totally damaged from a &amp;#34;conditioning rinse&amp;#34; I purchased (and trashed) and it kept my hair smooth on a very humid day. No dry ends, no limp hair, non oily, no bad scents, no chemicals. Thank you Christina moss. Very happy. I use this the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is perfect for me--a chemically sensitive individual.  It has a light, pleasant smell and really makes my hair feel soft!  I think it is helping my hair get somewhat thicker as well!  At first I was worried it would run out too fast, but a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> A little goes a surprisingly long way. I have really thick shoulder length hair and I use a lot less of this than chemical laden conditioner, which I was not expecting. It makes my hair very soft without residue and has a very light pleasant smell</li>
    <li> Amazing costumer service. But he product didn&#x27;t work well, the bottles were small. But i needed a ton of the product. And i have short hair.</li>
    <li> This might be a good product but is a crazy small size for the price.  This will last me only a few uses.  I appreciate organic but need to have a good value in products that I buy.  I should&#x27;ve been more careful reading the description when I ordered.</li>
    <li> First--I love the shampoo, Leaves hair and scalp squeaky clean (no other shampoo has ever done this) and shiny. I use the conditioner only about every third shampoo:  it definitely does the job--shiny, moisturized strands and ends--but my very fine, pixie cut  hair is somewhat flatter than if I had not used it.  Incidentally:  the packaging for both is great--really securely sealed bottles and you can read the labels--&amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Conditioner&amp;#34; even in a relatively dark walk-in shower. Also:  thank you!--No scent!(except clean).  You CM people are doing everything right--keep it up!</li>
    <li> I really liked it bot don&#x27;t  like leaving it in as suggested to be an option. Will try their other products</li>
    <li> I wish I could have liked this product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have longer hair (to my bra strap), and this conditioner ALWAYS left my hair in knots. It hurt to brush it, and it was so tangled that I had pieces of my brush flying off. I even tried to use a lot more to see if it was just the amount I was putting in, but that didn&#x27;t matter. It always felt like I had just put shampoo in, not also conditioner. It also smelled great out of the bottle, but never left my hair smelling like anything. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair texture either. I used the entire (small) bottle, because for $20 I didn&#x27;t want it to go to waste, but I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m done using it. I love the idea of using organic products, and like I said, I really wanted this to work for me, but it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is a very good facial soap. It cleans your skin very well without a &amp;#34;soap residue&amp;#34; after rinsing. My first bottle lasted quite awhile.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is awesome.  It&#x27;s natural and left my hair feeling great!!</li>
    <li> Nourishes without chemicals, clean &amp; refreshing! Best organic/natural product that really works!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Has a slight fragrance that is fantastic! I have salon highlights. My colorist couldn&#x27;t believe how well my color held up. She only did minor touch ups to my roots after 5 weeks.. My hair feels wonderful! I will buy again! I recommend the companion shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> I saw this reviewed in Urbanette Magazine as a great natural product. It&#x27;s also on their Pinterest board @urbanette under Organic Beauty Products We Love. It&#x27;s healthy/natural and smells AMAZING. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Not every conditioner works for me.  I do the no-poo shampo, and this conditioner has been great.  It has a nice light fragrance, and it did the job.  I don&#x27;t use commercial products on my hair, just coconut oil, sunflower lecithin and essential oils, which are all easy to rinse out of my hair with this conditioner.  I would recommend Christina Moss Naturals, I&#x27;m sure their shampoo is great too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Nothing special</li>
    <li> Its SO hard to find a conditioner without any harmful ingredients. Hundreds of companies advertise their products as containing none of this or that, or being all natural, but when i read through the ingredient list i find a ton of ingredients that aren&#x27;t safe to be used on our skin, even in the minimal doses used in cosmetics and hair/skin products. Take for example cocomide MEA or DEA or cocmidopropyl betaine. One of these is in almost  every shampoo on the market, 2 are known carcinogens and one is a severe skin irritant when used regularly ( which shampoos generally are, hopefully.)&lt;br /&gt;Its also hard to find a conditioner without harmful ingredients that works, aka doesn&#x27;t leave residue, untangles hair easily, etc.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels absolutely amazing since using this conditioner, It has been about a month of using it daily. I was having a really hard time using other natural brands because my hair would be left feeling sticky or oily, but with this conditioner my hair feels soft and light and clean, and has NO residue build up. My hair untangles easily with this and the smell is so so pleasant. I only wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> Fabulous conditioner...safe for my scalp and leaves my hair softer and shinier than any conditioner I have ever used. You use a very tiny bit of it so this bottle lasts a long time. Excellent procduct. Try it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> All in the family have started this conditioner, after shampoo and leave in.  Feels great.</li>
    <li> This is great.  My hair is very fine and curly.  It is soft and not heavy.  Only a very small amount is needed.  Try it.  You will like it.</li>
    <li> Bought this conditioner/shampoo combo due to chemical interaction issue, they work well for me, no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. I also use Christina Moss Naturals shampoo and my hair is so gorgeous and soft--happier than it&#x27;s ever been.  I am extremely conscious about the products I put on my body and I was so happy to discover this line of products--highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I had decided to do the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; thing on my long, fine, extensively highlighted hair recently and have discovered that I needed something on my ends or that my hair was going to resemble a brillo pad.  Also to note, I was a hairdresser for years, which compounds this craziness of using no shampoo on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a leave in conditioner just for that purpose, which is why I bought this, noting it had so many reviews with exclamation points extolling the wonders of this little bottle.  Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Its not a leave in conditioner (the headline just says &amp;#34;use as a leave in!&amp;#34;).  However, its so light I couldn&#x27;t see how you would really use it any other way.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like much unless you get your nose right up in that bottle (which is a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;3. If you&#x27;re using it as a leave in, a little drop will do you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I won&#x27;t say that this is a miracle product and I think it was miscategorized here as I looked for &amp;#34;leave in conditioner&amp;#34; specifically here, but its not bad.  Would not recommend it for thick or coarse hair though.</li>
