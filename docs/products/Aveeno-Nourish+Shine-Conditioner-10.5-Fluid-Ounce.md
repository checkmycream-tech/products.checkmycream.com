      <li>I would recommend this conditioner to anyone who wants beautiful hair!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve a curly hair and this product makes it shine and healthy 100%.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Rinses clean, smells nice.  </li>
      <li>I will stick with my Aveda product as it works best for my shoulder length, fine blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>This product has a nice light, clean, femine, scent to it.</li>
      <li>The conditioner works great, easy to comb through and it leaves soft, shiny hair.  </li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it and it has an amazing lather.</li>
      <li>and I really enjoy this product</li>
      <li>/&gt;- makes hair feel smooth and silky&lt;</li>
      <li>if you are looking for a light conditioner this is it.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I buy shampoos and conditioners,  and one is better than the other,  but here the conditioner pairs very nicely with the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Hair feels very clean, soft, manageable, shiny, and full of volume.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, clean and shiny with a light clean scent.</li>
      <li>Please see our previous review of the Aveeno Revitalize Shampoo; using the two together has given my wife&#x27;s hair much more volume and made it much more manageable and clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced,  good product,  I would definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>I spend more on my hair products than I do on my makeup since my hair is long and tends to get damaged easily.</li>
      <li>I have found that this product does a pretty good job with the brazilian keratin treatment and does not wash out the treatment or ruin it like other shampoos and conditioners that have a lot of sulfates.</li>
      <li>good, didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
      <li>Great stuff but hard to get sometimes.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner really made all the difference!</li>
      <li>I tried this first when we went on vacation</li>
      <li>I love the smell, less hair fall and it feels clean after shapooing</li>
      <li>Nice, smooth, and very moisturizing conditioner for my thick, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>My regular shampoo and conditioner were washing it out fast and although my hair was straight, it wasn&#x27;t very shiny or healthy looking.</li>
      <li>However, one of the bloggers I follow, Tina from Myhighestselfblog.com, had tried the Aveeno Pure Renewal Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the smell while I am washing my hair but don&#x27;t notice it too much after my hair is dry.</li>
      <li>It works very well for twist outs and for shaping curls after combing.  </li>
      <li>I definitely noticed more shine in my hair and it is consistently soft each time I wash it.</li>
      <li>Once I got used to the fact that I didn&#x27;t need to squeeze the bottle too much to get the conditioner out of it, I was actually really pleased how little conditioner I needed to use to cover all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I forgot conditioner, and our only option for buying more was at the local grocery store.</li>
      <li>I will use Aveeno during the high humidity days of summer.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner smells so good I constantly get compliments and for someone who had extremely damaged dry and frizzy hair before, I now have the softest hair ever that really shines!</li>
      <li>I actually poured way too much the first time I used it because it is so runny.</li>
      <li>But right now I have the shiniest, healthiest, and softest hair of my life and a big part of the reason is this product.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I ditched our expensive salon conditioner and now use the Aveeno Nourish+Shine shampoo and conditioner all the time.</li>
      <li>I recommend using it with the nourish and shine shampoo because at first I was only using the conditioner and a different brand shampoo, my hair looked great, but after using the shampoo that goes with it the difference was obvious, the health and shine was clear, and it now seems obvious that other less-natural shampoos were drying out my hair.</li>
      <li>bottles are 10.5 Fl Ounces, not terribly small</li>
      <li>It does not make hair limp, instead it&#x27;s light</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just so soft and shiny with these products.  </li>
      <li>Both work to give my shortish,  frequently dyed hair shine and movement.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-doesn&#x27;t feel like it rinses completely out</li>
      <li>completely agree with Aveeno&#x27;s claims.</li>
      <li>The scent is a little strong for me, and reminiscent of pantene.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling nourished and soft, it was still very tangled and dry after washing and conditioning.</li>
      <li>Which, for good shampoo and conditioner, isn&#x27;t really all that bad.</li>
      <li>I was actually very pleasantly surprised that they did last me quite a while.</li>
      <li>The conditioner on the other hand, was much thinner than I am used to.</li>
      <li>I suppose I expected aveeno to have a tastier more subtle earthy scent.</li>

    <li> It worked well, but not exceptionally well.  It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling nourished and soft, it was still very tangled and dry after washing and conditioning.</li>
    <li> good, didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth, and very moisturizing conditioner for my thick, curly hair.  It works very well for twist outs and for shaping curls after combing.  I like it a lot.  The scent is a little strong for me, and reminiscent of pantene.  I suppose I expected aveeno to have a tastier more subtle earthy scent.</li>
    <li> Great stuff but hard to get sometimes.  Works well on both thick and thin hair.  It has taken over my family by storm.</li>
    <li> I have had fine, frizzy, curly and horrible hair forever. But right now I have the shiniest, healthiest, and softest hair of my life and a big part of the reason is this product. I have found that this product does a pretty good job with the brazilian keratin treatment and does not wash out the treatment or ruin it like other shampoos and conditioners that have a lot of sulfates. Before starting this product I had gotten the keratin treatment done about 2 months before. My regular shampoo and conditioner were washing it out fast and although my hair was straight, it wasn&#x27;t very shiny or healthy looking. This conditioner really made all the difference! The conditioner smells so good I constantly get compliments and for someone who had extremely damaged dry and frizzy hair before, I now have the softest hair ever that really shines! I recommend using it with the nourish and shine shampoo because at first I was only using the conditioner and a different brand shampoo, my hair looked great, but after using the shampoo that goes with it the difference was obvious, the health and shine was clear, and it now seems obvious that other less-natural shampoos were drying out my hair. I hope they never stop making this product!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something different and less expensive than my stand-by product, \\&quot;Aveda Rosemary Mint after shampoo hair conditioner.\\&quot;  I like the Aveeno, unscented body wash products and have been using them for years.  So, I thought I would try their hair conditioner. I will stick with my Aveda product as it works best for my shoulder length, fine blonde hair.  I will use Aveeno during the high humidity days of summer.  For me personally, I don&#x27;t like my hair wrapping around and clinging to my face because of excess static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros and Cons for this Aveeno conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- smells great&lt;br /&gt;- makes hair feel smooth and silky&lt;br /&gt;- adds a little volume&lt;br /&gt;- great detangler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-creates bad fly-aways or basically just a lot of static&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t feel like it rinses completely out</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it with the Aveeno Active Naturals Nourish and Shine shampoo and leave in treatment conditioner. This product has a nice light, clean, femine, scent to it. Hair feels very clean, soft, manageable, shiny, and full of volume. I let my hair air dry and it&#x27;s just so soft and shiny with these products.  I no longer have any frizzies. It does not make hair limp, instead it&#x27;s light so you still have lots of volume. Works as good as salon products but at a fraction of price. Great moisterizer for hair but won&#x27;t make oily at all. Has a very pleasant smell that reminds me of fresh lilacs.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I tried this first when we went on vacation and I forgot conditioner, and our only option for buying more was at the local grocery store. I loved it so much I ditched our expensive salon conditioner and now use the Aveeno Nourish+Shine shampoo and conditioner all the time. It costs about 1/3 of the typical salon shampoo bottle too!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing conditioner and my hair looks better than ever! I would recommend this conditioner to anyone who wants beautiful hair!</li>
    <li> Amazon always ship my items on time and I really enjoy this product so I ordered a second one, however this time my product exploded in the box that it came in, the conditioner leaked everywhere... but I DO LIKE the product itself, just not the way it was packaged.</li>
    <li> The conditioner works great, easy to comb through and it leaves soft, shiny hair.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Please see our previous review of the Aveeno Revitalize Shampoo; using the two together has given my wife&#x27;s hair much more volume and made it much more manageable and clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I had heard about Aveeno hair care products but just assumed they would be too expensive for my taste. However, one of the bloggers I follow, Tina from Myhighestselfblog.com, had tried the Aveeno Pure Renewal Shampoo and Conditioner. She had awesome things to say about it so the next time I was in the market for hair products, I decided to give Aveeno a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting the Aveeno Nourish and Shine shampoo and conditioner from Amazon. They are a little cheaper on Amazon if you can buy in bulk but in the store, these will cost you around $7-$8 a bottle. Which, for good shampoo and conditioner, isn&#x27;t really all that bad. I spend more on my hair products than I do on my makeup since my hair is long and tends to get damaged easily. This shampoo and conditioner pair is said to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring back dull hair to a shiny state&lt;br /&gt;Helps repair damage in just 3 washes&lt;br /&gt;Gives hair strength, softness and shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are 10.5 Fl Ounces, not terribly small but I definitely didn&#x27;t see them lasting very long because of the length of my hair. I was actually very pleasantly surprised that they did last me quite a while. The shampoo is very thick so you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it and it has an amazing lather. The conditioner on the other hand, was much thinner than I am used to. I actually poured way too much the first time I used it because it is so runny. I was concerned about that because having a lot of hair, I am used to heavy cream consistency in my conditioners. Once I got used to the fact that I didn&#x27;t need to squeeze the bottle too much to get the conditioner out of it, I was actually really pleased how little conditioner I needed to use to cover all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely agree with Aveeno&#x27;s claims. I definitely noticed more shine in my hair and it is consistently soft each time I wash it. I love the smell while I am washing my hair but don&#x27;t notice it too much after my hair is dry. I am used to spraying a littleperfume in my hair before I leave the house anyways. I have since bought a second type of Aveeno Shampoo and Conditioner that I will post about later on. I definitely think I am hooked!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0037LEGZ4 Aveeno Nourish+Shine Conditioner, 10.5 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> conditions and revitalizes hair without being heavy - my thick hair was very dry from too much washing and sun- feels and looks great after use- have used it for several weeks .</li>
    <li> Sometimes I buy shampoos and conditioners,  and one is better than the other,  but here the conditioner pairs very nicely with the shampoo. Both work to give my shortish,  frequently dyed hair shine and movement.  Reasonably priced,  good product,  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, less hair fall and it feels clean after shapooing</li>
    <li> All Aveeno products I have used have been quality items. This is no exception to the rule. It leaves my hair soft, clean and shiny with a light clean scent.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. I&#x27;ve a curly hair and this product makes it shine and healthy 100%. My hair is softer than before by 70%. Also, the scent is beautiful.</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a light conditioner this is it. Rinses clean, smells nice.  I prefer the nourish and moisturize.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo but do not see any difference in the shine department.</li>
    <li> Still have this product be will not and cannot use it  this sucks does everything have fragrance in it boo</li>
