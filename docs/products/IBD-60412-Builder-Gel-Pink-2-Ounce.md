    <li> Great price, delivery was fast and my clients love it</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I was expecting and came in a timely manor. I am a manicurist and will continue to order.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all falls off very easy wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and as described. Cures in 3 minutes in a 36 watt UV lamp. I have used IBD gels for years, and this was a great price.</li>
    <li> I have a home based business where I do nails out of, sometimes I need products quickly and I used this company to try it out.  I was inpressed with the product in the timely matter that it was delivered.  I would recommend this company to anyone.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Thanks A+</li>
    <li> Good product, I had used it for a while but wish it had been a little more pink, and therefore would cover the line from a tip better. great product if you are planning on using polish over it</li>
    <li> I was hoping I could save $30 every two weeks, but no such luck.  I&#x27;ve tried and tried and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is not a clear pink, rather a translucent pink or more whitish pink. Other than that, its a great product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;IBD is a great  product!!</li>

    <li> Original and high quality item recieved, item was in good condition, I like it, and i will by more in future.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, the pink isnt super pigmented so it takes a couple of layers if you want it to look that way but this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Great, easy-to-use gel! I wasn&#x27;t aware it needed to be cured with a UV light (I saw postings saying LED would work), but once I used the UV it cured smooth, shiny, and very quickly! Saves me a lot of money and trips to the salon</li>
    <li> wish the pink was a little more pink but still a great deal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first-time user and I just bought what my nail person used to use.  I think I&#x27;ll buy it again when the time comes</li>
    <li> I love this gel builder. I have very poor nails from having celiac disease. I would never have any length if I did not have this to build the nail. I also love the IBD gel nail forms to give the extender nail the perfect shape and desired length. I get about a week  out of them, but I am a nurse and my hands are always very hard working. Most people can get 2-3 weeks out of an extender set.</li>
    <li> Great works as expected</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 15 yrs. I have yet not found a better product than IBD gel! I recommend this product highly!</li>

    <li> Bought this for at home manicures, this is great. Same product that the nail techs use at the salon, takes time to figure out how they use it. Practice makes perfect.</li>
