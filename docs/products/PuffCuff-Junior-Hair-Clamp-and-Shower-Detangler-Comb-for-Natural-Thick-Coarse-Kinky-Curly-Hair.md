      <li>I was so excited to get a detangling comb with the PuffCuff!</li>
      <li>Without a doubt this comb is the best comb when it comes to detangling wet hair.</li>
      <li>I have hair that tangles easily</li>
      <li>but I would have tried it regardless as my hair is a huge pain in the butt.</li>
      <li>It actually exceeded my expectations and I was happy to see that it isn&#x27;t at all flimsy.</li>
      <li>The PuffCuff Hair Clamp is great - a bit of nostalgia to another similar product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sturdy but light weight</li>
      <li>I have to practice more to get the wrapping action correct so that the PuffCuff has a tighter, more sleek bun versus it not being as secure going around.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think the PuffCuff is a great idea and love the fact that it is made for really dense hair.</li>
      <li>It works GREAT and is much gentler on your head and scalp then the traditional elastic hair tie.</li>

      <li>I plan to order more for my friends that have went natural.</li>

      <li>Also, the detangling comb is better than a single row comb.</li>
      <li>I really like the Puff Cuff Hair Clamp.</li>

      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I got a perm about a year ago and this brush makes it so much easier to brush through my hair after showering and shampoo/ conditioning my hair.</li>
      <li>It has never broken and it is flexible and sturdy.</li>
      <li>The comb works really well and its even easy to use on my daughters hair with little fuss.</li>
      <li>Luckily when this comb arrived I inspected it and each tooth is actually smooth without any seams, lifts in hard plastic.</li>
      <li>The teeth are nice and long so that I can get down to my scalp when detangling and not just detangle the surface hair.  </li>
      <li>I was nervous I would break the comb, so I made sure to detangle in small sections.</li>
      <li>This particular size is more geared towards someone with thick curly hair or very high density as it is larger.</li>
      <li>I do not wear a natural style; however, I wear wigs.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this comb!  I have hair that tangles easily and this comb just glides through my hair.  I am contemplating ordering a second one so that I can keep one in the shower and keep one in my bedroom.  My hair isn&#x27;t quite thick enough for the Puff Cuff Clamp, but I do like the style of it.</li>
    <li> Great buy! I purchased this combo because I needed another why tooth come. I actually was hoping that this comb didn&#x27;t have seems as they tend to damage and split hair strands. Luckily when this comb arrived I inspected it and each tooth is actually smooth without any seams, lifts in hard plastic. This comb is comparable to the larger black wide tooth combs however this one is even better. Detangling my hair was really simple and the puff cuff is equally amazing. It actually exceeded my expectations and I was happy to see that it isn&#x27;t at all flimsy. Both items are quality products and I will have to purchase another for my daughter. She loves the look of the puff cuff as well.&lt;br /&gt;This comb is perfect for washing my hair and detangling while in the shower so the hook comes in handy for easy hanging on my shower caddy hook.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be any more happy with this purchase and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! I have been using it for a few weeks now on my very thick long hair. The comb does wonders in the shower and takes out all the knots. I use it after I add my conditioner to my hair and then come through all of my hair before rinsing it out. It makes my hair so soft and smooth and it really takes out quite a bit of time coming out the knots that I get easily. As for the PuffCuff Hair Clamp, it is more recommended for those who have the type of hair that poofs out on its own and I would recommend it for those with shorter thicker hair. However it does work in my hair as well if it is dry. I tend to use the clamp to help keep shape to my messy bun and to keep it all up without falling down (My hair is almost down to my bottom so its quite long and thick). I recommend this product to anyone who has thick or curly hair!</li>
    <li> This hair brush is definitely made by a woman with thick curly hair.... THANK YOU!.. I got a perm about a year ago and this brush makes it so much easier to brush through my hair after showering and shampoo/ conditioning my hair. My hair is extremely long and curly when not blow dried out. I love this comb as it makes it thru my hair with out pulling or breaking it. The Clamp is really big and wide so it a nice mix up from just hair ties that I pop and snap all the time.  I did receive this product for a review.. but I would have tried it regardless as my hair is a huge pain in the butt.</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:72f16b3c6ad88ecf77190b081fd01cd6]]I ordered this puff cuff and detangling comb because I have very curly, kinky hair and a traditional scrunchie messes up my curls and I wanted something that would help me put my hair up into a puff ball without messing up my curls. This is like a banana clip but circular in shape. It worked well but I need something about half the size of this one.  The detangling comb worked great in my hair. The teeth are nice and long so that I can get down to my scalp when detangling and not just detangle the surface hair.  I liked both products and I will reuse both of them.

    <li> [[VIDEOID:6e0574aaf6d1e06f83d37144c313380]]PuffCuff Hair Clamp and Shower Detangler Comb for Natural Thick Coarse Kinky Curly Hair is a great starter package for anyone with thick curly hair. This package contains two different items. One is the actual PuffCuff Hair Clamp and the other is a Diane Shower Comb. The shower comb is a great shower comb and one of my favorite types. It works great to start the detangling process when hair is pliable with conditioner or a prepoo (conditioning agent before shampooing). The way that it works is great for getting out tangles. One tip is to change the direction of the comb when you meet an area that isn&#x27;t gliding through (flip it over so that the teeth of the comb go in a different direction).    As far as the PuffCuff Hair Clamp is concerned, I like it for securing a bun or messy ponytail updo. This particular size is more geared towards someone with thick curly hair or very high density as it is larger. I like that the teeth of the PuffCuff are not jagged so that my hair is not ripped. They are made to sink down into the hair, wrap around similar to a banana clip and secure with a hook type clamp. I have to practice more to get the wrapping action correct so that the PuffCuff has a tighter, more sleek bun versus it not being as secure going around. I am sure practice will make perfect. Overall, I think the PuffCuff is a great idea and love the fact that it is made for really dense hair. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This review is my own opinion and what I truly thought of this item.</li>
    <li> The puff does make your hair look fuller, the comb was not good for me , I&#x27; be used better !!</li>
    <li> I love the comb.  It has never broken and it is flexible and sturdy. I have thick natural hair that is very curly kinky nappy whatever you want to say. This comb gets through my naps with ease. I have to comb my hair while it is wet soaking in conditioner but this comb is still the only one that doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt. The rounded tips are soft on my scalp. I use it on my daughters hair too to detangle and her hair is thin with a looser curl but this comb still does great with doing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the hair clamp. Two things I like: (1) it doesn&#x27;t pull tight on your hair so you won&#x27;t get the head pain that we often get when doing a puff and (2) the shape allows it to hold even the thickest of hair. It&#x27;s sturdy but light weight so it holds your hair in place and isn&#x27;t tight... Definitely can&#x27;t go wrong there.</li>
    <li> I love this puff clamp and Comb.  The comb works really well and its even easy to use on my daughters hair with little fuss.</li>
    <li> The PuffCuff Hair Clamp is great - a bit of nostalgia to another similar product but this one is the best. My hair is thick and wavy the PuffCuff hair clamp holds all of my hair in and out of the shower. My hair does not get caught in the combs of the PuffCuff hair clamp. I can use the PuffCuff as a ponytail at the top of my head or the nape. The Shower Detangler Comb is made by a Diane who is now part of Frome company. Diane hair combs have always been a professional hair care products. The Shower Detangler Comb works well in the shower and out the shower. I like the opening on the comb where it can be used on a hook in the shower so that it is never displaced. I love both products and recommend them to everyone. I received this product in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> I lLove this PuffCuff! Since I went natural I&#x27;ve been looking for something to hold all of my think hair in one ponytail puff. All my hair ties kept popping and breaking. This is perfect for my hair! I plan to order more for my friends that have went natural.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Puff Cuff. Totally been a lifesaver for me. It works GREAT and is much gentler on your head and scalp then the traditional elastic hair tie. Without a doubt this comb is the best comb when it comes to detangling wet hair.</li>
    <li> It really did comb through my long, tangled mass of hair after shampooing. What seemingly took a long time of spraying on de-tangler and combing, was handled with just a few brush strokes. You can believe what you&#x27;ve read about it. works great to get rid of my knots and tangles after the shower. The brush looks like a normal brush but it has been a great investment and has cut down on the time required to brush my hair. I have recommended this product to others. I no longer dread brushing my hair after a shower.. I love using this on my kid&#x27;s wet hair, much faster and much less painful then using a comb. If your hair is dryI&#x27;ve been on a long search to find what products will work best for my hair. After trying many things I&#x27;ve settled on this brush combined with Johnson&#x27;s Detangler Spray. I&#x27;m so happy to have found a solution to put an end to the long frustrating process I used to go thru to get my hair brushed thru after I showered. For those of you who know how frustrating tangling hair can be I highly recommend this product &amp; hope you also find the combination of brush &amp; detangler that works for you! I&#x27;m so relieved that i now only have to spend a few minutes brushing my hair after I shower to have it smooth &amp; tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;( I got this product at a discount to give my honest review)</li>
    <li> This set is absolutely amazing. I do not wear a natural style; however, I wear wigs.  I relax my hair every 8-12 weeks - so my hair is VERY thick and coarse.  From the root to the end -  this comb detangled my kinks with ease.  Not to mention I had very little shedding. I love, love. love this comb. The hair clamp is an added bonus.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Bought the comb and clamp for my daughter-in-law,  she has thick and curly hair, comes off looking frizzy.  So thought she would love this, to help her out.  She says she likes the clamp to keep her hair away from her face and the comb works beautifully.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> For the last three years, I&#x27;ve stopped using relaxers and let my natural hair grow. It&#x27;s pretty thick and long and takes over 45 minutes to detangle.  I was so excited to get a detangling comb with the PuffCuff! The comb has two rows of alternating teeth, which helps speed up the detangling process. I was able to detangle my hair within 25 minutes!  One thing about the comb is the material from which it is made. The plastic is a little flimsy. I was nervous I would break the comb, so I made sure to detangle in small sections. The comb held up!  As for the PuffCuff, plan to use it on wet or damp hair. It is difficult to get all of your hair into the clamp if the hair is dry. Also, I would recommend this for longer haired Naturals who can get their hair into a ponytail. Given the size of the clamp, it&#x27;d be difficult to get shorter hair into the accessory.  Overall, the PuffCuff is better quality than a banana clip. Also, the detangling comb is better than a single row comb. I would recommend this product to longer-haired Naturals and anyone who is looking for a way to tame their natural hair!

    <li> my mom and I love this comb and clamp. Clamp stays in place without a lot of tension on edges.</li>
    <li> I really like the Puff Cuff Hair Clamp. I actually use it on my 4-year old daughter. While it&#x27;s a little big for her head, it does grip very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the bananas that I was using.</li>
