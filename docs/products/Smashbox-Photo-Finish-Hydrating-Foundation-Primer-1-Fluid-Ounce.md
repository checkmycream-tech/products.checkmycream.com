<ol>
      <li>I have used all of the photo finish products, but like this one the best because it moisturizes too.</li>
      <li>It is wonderful</li>
      <li>All in all, a great product!</li>
      <li>This product helps makeup application, the foundation appears flawless.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job at keeping my makeup from getting into my pores.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Works great on my skin.</li>
      <li>A great product would buy again.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>This product is great for helping to look good in all light.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Love the product!  </li>
      <li>Love all Smashbox products!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Makeup just glides on the skin leaving  a nice finish.  </li>
      <li>love it-use it every day and will continue to use it every day - make up goes on very smooth</li>
      <li>It feels more like lotion going on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be searching for a better moisturizing primer.</li>
      <li>Make up lasts all day while keeping skin healthy.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and keeps my makeup set all day!</li>
      <li>Enjoy the look!</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten the PHOTO FINISH primer with SPF 20 (it&#x27;s a pink/peach colored one), which is probably my favorite one.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m really glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>May be it can do more</li>
      <li>The other one I am referring to leaves my face looking flawless.</li>
      <li>But, the most important thing is how it reflects light in photos.  </li>
      <li>No color to this ... just smooths your skin and makes concealer (or any make up) easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Makeup goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Photofinish original.</li>
      <li>and I do like the original Smashbox primer, too.  </li>
      <li>I have dry skin and this primer works great.</li>
      <li>Many reviews stated that this was very moisturizing</li>
      <li>I did not find this to be true</li>
      <li>I love this product and highly recommend it</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much; it spreads easily and well.</li>
      <li>Like my 37 year old face  :  )</li>
      <li>My younger nieces ( early 20&#x27;s) don&#x27;t like it as much as the regular primer, so maybe its for &#x27;more experienced&#x27; skin.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, it is probably a good product for younger people but for a 50 year old woman, too much of the product is needed for coverage.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it does exactly what it says it will: it provides a better surface for your foundation.</li>
      <li>I had some of the regular smashbox primer, but this one is so much better.</li>
      <li>Digital photos (most photos are) in certain lighting will lose pixels and cause you to look really decrepit.  </li>
      <li>Have used other Smashbox primers in the past but this one works the best for me.  </li>
      <li>While I love my moisturizer, I find this little extra step also keeps my face more evenly moisturized.</li>
      <li>One bottle lasted me approxaimtely four months, using it 4-5 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;- Very lightweight.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a &amp;#34;photo finish&amp;#34; difference because it didn&#x27;t really stop my face from getting oily throughout the day or anything</li>
      <li>my foundation looks even without as much effort; and (3)</li>
      <li>I really like this primer for keeping my makeup in place.  </li>
      <li>I really notice this when I wash my face at night.  </li>
      <li>This primer is more liquid-y than their other primers.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t feel like this is particularly hydrating</li>
      <li>Even though the foundation I use is long-lasting, the primer does several things that I am able to notice: (1) my foundation goes on more easily; (2)</li>
      <li>I bought my first one at Sephora and this is my second tube.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, moisturizes, and last long.</li>
      <li>In terms of a primer, I&#x27;m not sure that it does as good of a job as the other two.</li>
      <li>I use a small amount after my moisturizer and it allows my foundation to blend easily and stay put all day.  </li>
      <li>I personally prefer the clear one.</li>
      <li>I also really like the under eye primer, if anyone&#x27;s curious about that one.</li>
      <li>I still like the product, but just not as much as the other primers they offer.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is not nearly thick enough to help with truly dry skin.</li>
      <li>I have pretty easy to deal with skin, but my face gets dry between the air conidtioning/ heat and the cold weather outside.</li>

<li> I have really dry skin so trying to find a primer that works well is hard.</li>
<li> Would recommend it for those you would like a smooth base before applying foundation or powder.</li>
<li> I touch a lot, such my nose and the side of my face where I put my hair behind my ears.</li>
<li> I also tried the green one and that seemed to help with reddish blemishes.</li>
<li> I still use my regular Neutrogena moisturizer in the evenings, and reserve this for use in the mornings just prior to applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;- Very expensive.</li>
<li> but bangkok heat is ridiculous.</li>
<li> This one leaves a weird texture.</li>
<li> I think this is too expensive for make up</li>
<li> i purchased this product thinking that because of its price it would be amazing.i was wrong!</li>

    <li> I have dry skin and this primer works great. I bought my first one at Sephora and this is my second tube. Love it!</li>
    <li> No color to this ... just smooths your skin and makes concealer (or any make up) easy to apply.  I have used all of the photo finish products, but like this one the best because it moisturizes too.</li>
    <li> This primer is more liquid-y than their other primers. I have gotten the PHOTO FINISH primer with SPF 20 (it&#x27;s a pink/peach colored one), which is probably my favorite one. I also tried the green one and that seemed to help with reddish blemishes. This one is just different. It feels more like lotion going on.

    <li> Love the product!  Love all Smashbox products!</li>
    <li> I love this product and highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Have used other Smashbox primers in the past but this one works the best for me.  Goes on smoothly and keeps my makeup set all day!</li>
    <li> This one is alright. I personally prefer the clear one. Photofinish original. This one leaves a weird texture. The other one I am referring to leaves my face looking flawless.</li>
    <li> Love it! Would recommend it for those you would like a smooth base before applying foundation or powder. Enjoy the look!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Whether I use a foundation or just powder it stays on. A great product would buy again.</li>
    <li> I think this is too expensive for make up but I bought it because of a wedding coming up and I love it! I don&#x27;t really notice a &amp;#34;photo finish&amp;#34; difference because it didn&#x27;t really stop my face from getting oily throughout the day or anything but it definitely will hold my foundation and bronzer on for the entire day and night so I&#x27;m really glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my make up on all day but my face is still dry even with moisturizer and this hydrating primer.</li>
    <li> This product helps makeup application, the foundation appears flawless.  But, the most important thing is how it reflects light in photos.  Digital photos (most photos are) in certain lighting will lose pixels and cause you to look really decrepit.  This product is great for helping to look good in all light.</li>
    <li> I really like this primer for keeping my makeup in place.  I use a small amount after my moisturizer and it allows my foundation to blend easily and stay put all day.  I really notice this when I wash my face at night.  Without the primer, my face skin feels oily and my makeup is half gone, but with the primer...I can feel it&#x27;s still there when I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like this is particularly hydrating and I do like the original Smashbox primer, too.  All in all, a great product!</li>
    <li> Has helped controling sweat on my face 80%.  May be it can do more but bangkok heat is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is wonderful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this really did anything for my skin, because I couldn&#x27;t tell that it made any difference. I did notice after using it a couple of weeks that a dry patch developed in one spot and stayed there as long as I was using the product.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product thinking that because of its price it would be amazing.i was wrong! it gave me dry skin and made me break out...i would not recomend it at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the third one i&#x27;ve gone thru. I had some of the regular smashbox primer, but this one is so much better. I can tell such a difference in foundation application after putting this on.  And I don&#x27;t notice my make up ever looking dry or flakey, no matter which foundation I use ( and I have several I go back n forth between!  Like we all probably do )&lt;br /&gt; My younger nieces ( early 20&#x27;s) don&#x27;t like it as much as the regular primer, so maybe its for &#x27;more experienced&#x27; skin.  Like my 37 year old face  :  ) I also really like the under eye primer, if anyone&#x27;s curious about that one. I actually put that one of AFTER foundation to take away that dried out under eye look.</li>
    <li> love it-use it every day and will continue to use it every day - make up goes on very smooth</li>
    <li> Many reviews stated that this was very moisturizing so I tried it.  I did not find this to be true (dimethicone is going to make anything feel lubricated).  Additionally, it is probably a good product for younger people but for a 50 year old woman, too much of the product is needed for coverage.  I&#x27;ll be searching for a better moisturizing primer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Makeup just glides on the skin leaving  a nice finish.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The box was a little crushed</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way. One bottle lasted me approxaimtely four months, using it 4-5 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;- Very lightweight. I like to wear this under makeup because it provides just enough moisture to keep the makeup from settling into creases, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing multiple layers of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- This moisturizer is not nearly thick enough to help with truly dry skin. I still use my regular Neutrogena moisturizer in the evenings, and reserve this for use in the mornings just prior to applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;- Very expensive. While I really like the product, I will also be evaluating some less expensive alternatives.</li>
    <li> Makeup goes on smooth. Works great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 5 months ago (and it took me that long to finish that bottle wearing it at least 5 days a week, FWIW). I use [[ASIN:B005EQONBW Smashbox Studio Skin 15 Hour Wear Foundation]] as well as  [[ASIN:B0030X8RTU Smashbox Halo Hydrating Perfecting Powder]]. I start by washing my face and applying toner and moisturizer. I then apply a pea-sized amount of the Photo Finish Foundation Primer (Hydrating). You don&#x27;t need much; it spreads easily and well. A lot of people would say skip this step, but I disagree. Even though the foundation I use is long-lasting, the primer does several things that I am able to notice: (1) my foundation goes on more easily; (2) my foundation looks even without as much effort; and (3) my foundation stays in the place even in areas of my face I touch a lot, such my nose and the side of my face where I put my hair behind my ears. I have pretty easy to deal with skin, but my face gets dry between the air conidtioning/ heat and the cold weather outside. While I love my moisturizer, I find this little extra step also keeps my face more evenly moisturized. Overall, it does exactly what it says it will: it provides a better surface for your foundation.</li>
    <li> Great product. Make up lasts all day while keeping skin healthy. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin so trying to find a primer that works well is hard. This one does it all in my opinion. It goes on smooth, moisturizes, and last long. It does a great job at keeping my makeup from getting into my pores. I don&#x27;t believe this alone will keep your makeup lasting longer but it is a start. I recommend one of Urban Decay&#x27;s finishing sprays for a lasting look, Chill is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the price was easier to digest though.</li>
