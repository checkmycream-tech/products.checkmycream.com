<li> hard to pick right color, not your fault.  </li>
<li> I made the hole larger cutting with top with scissors, mistake.</li>
<li> [[ASIN:B006ECU3Q4 Tickled Pink Airbrush Kit with Dark Shades Makeup]]I have fair skin and not knowing what anything about the colors of the blushes, I was afraid I&#x27;d end up looking like Bozo the clown.</li>
<li> I used just 4 drops to do my cheeks, lips, and a little soft color to my eyes.  </li>
<li> dont start heavy</li>
<li> My issue was the mixing ball kept getting stuck in the nipple making it near impossible to get the makeup to dispense.  </li>
<li> Though I am not impressed with their foundations, I like their blush line.  </li>
<li> I am addicted to the airbrush makeup now!</li>
<li> Not too bad</li>

    <li> I must need more practice</li>
    <li> works great in the air brush</li>
    <li> Initially I thought this product was ineffective, but it was because of my ignorance in how to apply.  After learning the proper technique, the product is amazing.  The customer service rep was so helpful and profeessional.  I appreciate the make-up tips and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It was ok pretty and pinkish. Start of light then build up when needed dont start heavy wont look right just take your time with it. Set with a powder of your choice if you dont want nothing you can just dust on some light translucent powder it will help cause if not it will get shiny on you unless you like that dewy look.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color and goes on smooth.  I do a light coat when I have fair skin and little bit heavier when I have a tan.  Looks great either way!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B006ECU3Q4 Tickled Pink Airbrush Kit with Dark Shades Makeup]]I have fair skin and not knowing what anything about the colors of the blushes, I was afraid I&#x27;d end up looking like Bozo the clown. But this color was perfect for my skin color. So I won&#x27;t be joining the circus anytime soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use with your airbrush but be sure to practice lots before passing judgment as it takes a few strokes to get it that just right color or pink and the right location on the face.</li>
    <li> I only need two drops and my cheeks are roooooosy. :)  It lasts alllll day and it looks natural.  Don&#x27;t overuse or you&#x27;ll look clownish.</li>
    <li> ok I ordered this rose pink thinking it would be like luminess (SOFT ROSE)  its very close I will use it I like it however, if anyone out these would like to match lumpiness here are some tips on matching ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUMINESS SOFT ROSE--GET GLAM AIR B6 PEACHY BEIDGE&lt;br /&gt;FOUNDATION IF YOU WEAR THE WARM SET FROM LUMINESS NUMBER 5--GLAM AIR M7 ALSO LUMINESSES NUMBER 6 --GO WITH GLAM AIR M8.</li>
    <li> enjoyed this product.  worked great. hard to pick right color, not your fault.  Got my color right and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color!  This went on smooth and lasts forever!  I used just 4 drops to do my cheeks, lips, and a little soft color to my eyes.  I am addicted to the airbrush makeup now!</li>
    <li> Not too bad but I do like the Luminess Air Products better.  Jill Lehr</li>
    <li> Very nice for light colored skin. I use it in my tickled pink airbrush system and its very nice and smooth. I recommend this brand of blush.</li>
    <li> The  color was nice.  My issue was the mixing ball kept getting stuck in the nipple making it near impossible to get the makeup to dispense.  I made the hole larger cutting with top with scissors, mistake.</li>
    <li> Nice color.  Arrived promptly. Happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Though I am not impressed with their foundations, I like their blush line.  They are accurate to color shown and go on nicely</li>
    <li> Pretty shade of airbrush blush.  It does have a bit of shimmer to it and works best when applied underneath the foundation.  I think this shade would work well with lots of different skin tones.  Good quality!</li>
    <li> It clogs the machine,  dosen&#x27;t go on as flowing as the others</li>
