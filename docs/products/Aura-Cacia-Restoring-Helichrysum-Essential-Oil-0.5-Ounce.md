      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>Be sure to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and flush out toxins.</li>
      <li>This may be okay for people who are trying to reduce scars and would dilute with a carrier anyway</li>
      <li>Also, my skin appeared clearer and more toned, and of course, moisturized.</li>
      <li>this and frankencense together are pretty durn good.</li>
      <li>and you may notice that you sweat more easily.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s ready to use, but can you please be HONEST in the product description?</li>
      <li>Thanks for making this great product available.</li>
      <li>Love this smell, it is a light earthy smell and claims to repel fleas and insects.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for many purposes and the oil has not disappointed me once.</li>
      <li>A great essential oil from a reputable supplier and delivered in a timely manner by Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Considering those draw-backs the oil itself seems just fine.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how quickly this stuff works!</li>
      <li>Nice scent, reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the itching stopped!!</li>
      <li>have never had any product work this quickly and with such great results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Yesterday, I received my shipment of the Helichrysum EO, (the first of many, for I will never be without it) and could not wait to use it.  </li>
      <li>A friend recently told me how good my skin looks and basically wrinkle free.</li>
      <li>Good enough smell</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and as discribed</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t read the &amp;#34;fine print&amp;#34;, went through quickly and ordered this as 100% pure essential oil which it&#x27;s not... mostly jojoba oil which I like fine but not for this price!  </li>
      <li>It is made in Greece and you can smell the helichrysum is fresh in it.  </li>
      <li>The title should be More clear that this is a blend and not 100%</li>
      <li>so I could use it right out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I seem to be finding the right potency in my mixes.</li>
      <li>Very well packaged, natural, potent and worth every cent.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Unless you are making your own tinctures and cosmetics or absolutely NEED a certain percentage of the essential oil to carrier oil than you don&#x27;t need to worry that the helichrysum is cut with jojoba.</li>
      <li>Always wash any cut or scrape with an antibacterial soap first, but (if the cut is not too deep) this is a great second act that helps it heal fast.</li>
      <li>Should have read better- not 100%- mixed with jojoba oil</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I have no idea how much helichrysum is in each drop!</li>
      <li>Thanks Aura!</li>
      <li>Love Aura Cacia essential oils!</li>
      <li>I use it on &amp;#34;bo-bos&amp;#34; and an itchy spot on the top of my scalp that&#x27;s been there for years, is finally finally going away.</li>
      <li>LOL!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks and the scar IS starting to look better but is still very noticeable.</li>
      <li>I thought it was pure.</li>
      <li>it does certainly help.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping as well was a plus</li>
      <li>I can use straight from bottle.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well either.</li>
      <li>By adding jojoba oil to this makes it very affordable.</li>
      <li>It really helps with circles and bags under my eyes.</li>
      <li>This really works to shorten the time in which bruising takes to dissipate.</li>
      <li>Can use straight from the bottle because it is already missed with a carrier oil.</li>
      <li>I really seems to be working.</li>
      <li>I really like Telia Naturale from Etsy.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>This bottle is very user unfriendly as well.  </li>
      <li>Their quality control is a standard I feel comfortable with.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have celiac disease and when I am inadvertently &amp;#34;glutened&amp;#34; I exhibit symptoms, one of which is dermatitis herpetiformis or celiac rash.  It is very painful; and I develop red welps that look like insect bites, the itch constantly.  I have tried anti-histamine tablets, creams and lotions and sometimes have had to use anti-biotics to keep down infection because my skin would break open because of the constant scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I received my shipment of the Helichrysum EO, (the first of many, for I will never be without it) and could not wait to use it.  I was glad that the product is pre-diluted so I could use it right out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rubbed some of the EO on the most recent break-outs,  on the some that were partially healed and on the scars of old lesions.  The first thing I noticed was the itching stopped!! Not lessened but immediately stopped.  Next the redness of the new partially healed break-outs went away and the new break-outs got lighter in color. I put on more before bed and this morning, the new lesions were flat,  with no itching, the old lesions were almost invisible except for the scabs, which are also lighter in color and the old scars are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a bruise on my knee, that looked like it would be there forever.  It was a dark, thick  horizontal line across the top of my kneecap.  I rubbed the Helichrysum EO on that as well, last night and this morning and the line is lighter in color and not as solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I have always had a problem with my heels, and in the winter I spend a fortune on products to keep them from cracking and to soften skin.  Just a little Helichrysum EO after my shower and this morning I had pink heels, not gray from dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any product work this quickly and with such great results.  Thanks for making this great product available.</li>
    <li> I use it on &amp;#34;bo-bos&amp;#34; and an itchy spot on the top of my scalp that&#x27;s been there for years, is finally finally going away.</li>
    <li> Very well packaged, natural, potent and worth every cent.  Highly recommend these for those into alternative medicines/healing/wellness.  Aura Cacia makes a great product.  Their quality control is a standard I feel comfortable with.</li>
    <li> Terrible smell.  Probably the least liked helichrysum I&#x27;ve bought.  I really like Telia Naturale from Etsy.  It is made in Greece and you can smell the helichrysum is fresh in it.  This bottle is very user unfriendly as well.  You have to shake the crap out of it to get a few drops.  Not worth the money.  Don&#x27;t get this.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well either.</li>
    <li> I used this product along with essential oils of lavender and frankincense mixed into coconut oil for a hemorrhoid remedy.  It works.  Just mix 2 drops of each oil (helichrysum,  lavender and frankincense into a tablespoon of coconut oil.  Apply to hemorrhoid 2 to 3 times daily.  I know that this oil has other uses. But this is what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Not too crazy about the shape of the bottle. No big deal. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!  I have lupus and use the oil on the skin lesions.  After a few days of use they just fall off!</li>
    <li> Helped lighten my acne scars and dark spots in a week. Great results fast!</li>
    <li> Aura Cacia does it again! If you have any experience with quality EO&#x27;s then you know this one is what you paid for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for many purposes and the oil has not disappointed me once. Great job Aura Cacia!</li>
    <li> This is a blend, NOT 100% essential oil!!! I feel ripped off, I didn&#x27;t read the &amp;#34;fine print&amp;#34;, went through quickly and ordered this as 100% pure essential oil which it&#x27;s not... mostly jojoba oil which I like fine but not for this price!  I dilute my own oils. I have no idea how much helichrysum is in each drop!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought from this company for awhile and they are the best quality and best priced oils on the market right now. This is good for your skin and feels good.</li>
    <li> This is not a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; essential oil. It is diluted in jojoba oil. Still a good deal, but I should have read more about it. ;)</li>
    <li> i use this to put a drop behind eash ear and rub in to help with vertigo.  it does certainly help.  this and frankencense together are pretty durn good.</li>
    <li> good oil works as said</li>
    <li> What a terrific price for this oil.  Arrived quickly and as discribed</li>
    <li> I am very happy w this produce. helichrysum kick starts about any essential oil I use. Love it. Fast shipping as well was a plus</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t explain it but this formula literally is like a SECRET WEAPON.</li>
    <li> Quality as usual with Aura Casia. Always great.</li>
    <li> Didnt know it is a blend. I thought it was pure. Didn&#x27;t feel the need to deal with a return so i kept it. I can put it in my body lotion. There is nothing wrong with the product I rated low because its not what I really wanted</li>
    <li> waiting for opportunity to use....just arrived  today.</li>
    <li> Should have read better- not 100%- mixed with jojoba oil</li>
    <li> Came in 2 days. Not really what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Love this smell, it is a light earthy smell and claims to repel fleas and insects.</li>
    <li> Smells great and love I can use straight from bottle. Much more affordable since it is already diluted with a carrier oil! Thanks Aura!</li>
    <li> Amazing oil for scars I had Achilles&#x27; tendon surgery which left me with an ugly scar : so please after a few weeks of using this oil the scar is lighting up , I must add is a 9 week old scar , every night I rub the oil and wrap it with a gauze so it can absorb into skin . I must add with any new scar contact Dr for clearance when you can apply oils . I postred my picture and you shall see the difference it made . Delivered on time very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  I am using for a specifc purpose, tinnitus, I heard it takes weeks for it to totally work.</li>
    <li> I use the product in my face serum that I use at night. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Good healing oil to have around the house.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Can use straight from the bottle because it is already missed with a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Love Aura Cacia essential oils! This is an expensive oil so I was hesitant to buy it, but it has so many benefits I had to try it. I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin, so I&#x27;m using it in all of my skin products and within a month I saw a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I initially bought the oil for a different purpose, but I ended up putting it on my face at night. It really helps with circles and bags under my eyes. I think the smell is soothing. There&#x27;s so much in the bottle--a real deal.</li>
    <li> I did not know this was cut with a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> This is what I have been looking for. It is already in a carrier oil so you don&#x27;t have to cut it when you receive. I use it twice daily to help with ankle pain for past 2 weeks and it has helped alot. It smells if that is a concern.</li>
    <li> It is the best for lifting spirits. it also helps a lot with anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it isgreat for lifting spirit.&lt;br /&gt;helps with stress and anxiety.</li>
    <li> I use this for the arthritis in my big toes (from running, my big toe joints lock.) I was skeptical at first but now I have significantly less pain! I used to feel it around mile 3 and then it&#x27;d go away around mile 5. I&#x27;d also feel it the next day walking around. Now I feel almost nothing! My toe joint still snaps and pops, and feels a bit stiffer than other toe joints, but the pain is gone. SOLD!</li>
    <li> The title should be More clear that this is a blend and not 100% Helichrysum instead off a brief mention buried in the product info. The first line of the product info even says &amp;#34;pure essential oil&amp;#34; when jojoba is not an essential oil I am relatively new to essential oils trying to build up my stock andI wasn&#x27;t even aware that some of the sellers dilute EOs with a carrier oil. They don&#x27;t even provide you with a ratio so it could be as little as 1:100 for all we know. This may be okay for people who are trying to reduce scars and would dilute with a carrier anyway but my intention for it was to create my own blends. Will think twice before ordering this brand and this seller now.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed to find out this was not 100% helichrysum oil. I should have known by the price that it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> One of the best essential oils for healing. Used it on cuts from yardwork...no pain, no major scars, healed quickly. Always wash any cut or scrape with an antibacterial soap first, but (if the cut is not too deep) this is a great second act that helps it heal fast.</li>
    <li> Pleased with this oil.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I add some to my facial oil I use everyday. This is a wonderful healing oil. Mix with a carrier oil, such as jojoba.</li>
    <li> By adding jojoba oil to this makes it very affordable.</li>
    <li> Great price love the oil!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this oil blend.  Nice scent, reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve used it for relaxation, for skin irritation, for headaches, and ear ringing.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> Very happy with all Aura  Cacia products!</li>
    <li> I use this daily prior to moisturizing. A friend recently told me how good my skin looks and basically wrinkle free. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product on my face and to remove makeup and it makes my face my skin in noticeably softer, I use in the morning and evening.  I was not misled to thin,k this was 100% Helichrysum, the label and site are clearly marked.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had read about this essential oil for a long time and had it on my wish list for a while, but did not want to spend the money on it. Finally my knee started acting up really badly so I gave in and bought it. This relieves my pain in just a few minutes and only takes a couple of drops. I have also tried it on bruises. The pictures are two different bruises that I got at the same time. I put the oil on the bottom bruise and two days later it was lighter and less painful to the touch while the top bruise took much longer to heal.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this oil, bought to mix to help with nerve pain. I really seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Good product,fast shipping!</li>
    <li> perfect pain and itch relief. I use to heal cuts, calm bites, as prep for painful beauty procedures, and it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Smells like it&#x27;s about a 3% solution just like the Camomile I tried.  Once it&#x27;s out of the bottle you can&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how quickly this stuff works! After just one day, I could see and feel the difference. My tired, sore, achey legs were soothed and I felt no pain. Also, my skin appeared clearer and more toned, and of course, moisturized. I also used this oil on a burn scar, which helped to fade and heal it faster than Neosporin. I will say though, Helichrysum is a warming plant--when you rub it into your skin it will make you feel warm and you may notice that you sweat more easily. Do not be alarmed; this is the body detoxifying. That is why it makes a great massage oil. Be sure to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and flush out toxins.</li>
    <li> This is very similar to chamomile which I&#x27;ve just been adding a few drops to lotions as I apply them to hands, face and body.  The fragrance is very subtle and pleasant and mixes well with any lotion or cream to enrich them and absorbs into the skin.</li>
    <li> even though it isnt Young Living oil, It  definitely does its job! and half the price as well!</li>
    <li> Aura Caria always has great products, and this oil was recommended for healing of wounds and scar tissue.  Massaging it in, it helped break up scar tissue on my foot which was left over from hammertoe surgery on 4 toes last Oct.  A great essential oil from a reputable supplier and delivered in a timely manner by Amazon.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> I have been using the heck out of this and although I can&#x27;t swear it makes bruises and cuts go away faster, it sure does smell nice!</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> This really works to shorten the time in which bruising takes to dissipate.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read close enough this is in a jojoba base so can&#x27;t be used for diffusing</li>
    <li> Seems to be working, though it is NOT the miracle that others have claimed! LOL!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks and the scar IS starting to look better but is still very noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Can be used in many concoctions. Good for just about anything inflammatory. Will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great product! Needed this oil and am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Nice feel. Use on face.</li>
    <li> Yes this is mixed with jojoba oil but you have to understand that all essential oils with the exception of maybe lavender must be mixed with a carrier oil in order for them to be used safely and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are making your own tinctures and cosmetics or absolutely NEED a certain percentage of the essential oil to carrier oil than you don&#x27;t need to worry that the helichrysum is cut with jojoba. It&#x27;s ready to use right out of the bottle whereas a pure helichrysum oil wouldn&#x27;t be and would have to be mixed with carrier oil before use. This option saves you money and a step so I don&#x27;t get why people vote these products down for not being 100% just the oil when it would cost you an arm and a leg to get it at 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said this oil helped immensely with nerve pain in my back. I brought it to work and massaged it into the problem area and after a few months my problem was gone. I usually use this oil for back and leg pain and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy to find this! It&#x27;s helps a lot wit my health conditions! Defiantly will buy again!</li>
    <li> I gave 3 stars because it is not a pure oil but already diluted in jojoba oil. It was in the product description but I didn&#x27;t notice it. Too bad. The mixture is nice though. Just be aware of this little detail and enjoy!</li>
    <li> Good oil, great price and fast service.</li>
    <li> You can tell which Aura Cacia oils come pre-diluted by the yellow on the label. I use this to make oil blends anyway, but I which I knew what the percent dilution is. I am pregnant and about to have a new baby, and also use essential oils for my children so I don&#x27;t like guessing at levels. Considering those draw-backs the oil itself seems just fine. Good enough smell and I seem to be finding the right potency in my mixes.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to use on painful wounds and sores for both pain relief and to promote healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used it on fissures, and it provided moderate numbing within 20 minutes, and has helped them to heal. (When literally nothing else was working.) Good for any skin problem where pain relief is desired. Even better pain relief when combined with 2% Roman Chamomile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was highly disappointed that this is sold as \\&quot;pure\\&quot; when by \\&quot;pure\\&quot; they mean diluted in jojoba and ready to use on the skin. Yes, it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s ready to use, but can you please be HONEST in the product description? Also, NOWHERE does it say what % it is diluted to! It&#x27;s safe directly on skin, so I&#x27;d imagine 2% or less, but that&#x27;s just a GUESS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, Aura Casia, be honest in your labeling and tell your customers what % this is!</li>
