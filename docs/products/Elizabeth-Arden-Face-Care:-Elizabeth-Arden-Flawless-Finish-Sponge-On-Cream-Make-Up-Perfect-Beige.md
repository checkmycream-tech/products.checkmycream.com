      <li>Great makeup, comes sealed, brand new</li>
      <li>I have found buying thru amazon is easy and satisfying.  </li>
      <li>and the coverage is good but not as much as I prefer.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, I have been using Elizabeth Arden products for quite a few years, I was delighted to find this at a reasonable price...</li>

      <li>This is a high quality make up.</li>
      <li>Order early.</li>
      <li>- I apply early each morning and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Arden is currently packaging this makeup in a smaller container--new and improved is really just smaller packaging.</li>
      <li>I found this on here and it is like half the price for the exact same thing.</li>

<li> Received packaging just like purchases at high end department stores for $15+ less.  </li>
<li> I gave 4 stars not because of the mkup,  because it took so long to get to me.</li>
<li> Will be going back to my other brands.</li>
<li> I use Bareminerals or Merle Norman and this brand seems a little thick and hard to smooth on!</li>
<li> Half the price that I pay in my local dept store.  </li>
<li> You can put it on with a wet sponge for a lighter coverage.  </li>
<li> but it became pretty expensive.</li>
<li> I usually use a different sponge than what is provided because I find the sponge that comes in the compact very small.  </li>
<li> , I was a make up artist, it covers but doesn&#x27;t look heavy.  </li>
<li> This was purchased for a friend and she loves this hard to find makeup.</li>
<li> Stinks like vaseline all day long.  </li>
<li> Very unpleasant aroma.</li>

    <li> This is a high quality make up. It becomes more expensive with smaller make up area every year though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this brand before now.. I use Bareminerals or Merle Norman and this brand seems a little thick and hard to smooth on! It does not blend easily! Will be going back to my other brands.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used Elizabeth Arden Flawless Finish for over 30 years.  It works for me!  I was very pleased to find a more affordable source to purchase it from.</li>
    <li> My elderly aunt will only use this make-up and requests for me to purchase every 3 months. So much easier and cheaper than going to the mall. Delivery is always on time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this make-up for anyone who likes a heavier coverage and a truly &amp;#34;flawless finish&amp;#34;.  I have used this brand for several years and I love it.

    <li> I love this make up I&#x27;ve used it for years. I&#x27;ve even worked for Elizabeth Arden yrs ago, I was a make up artist, it covers but doesn&#x27;t look heavy.  You can put it on with a wet sponge for a lighter coverage.  I gave 4 stars not because of the mkup,  because it took so long to get to me. But in all honesty the place I bought it from was very nice &amp; returned my emails promptly. .UT was probably the postal system but maybe not. It took mote than 10 says to get, but I&#x27;d still buy from them again, giving them the benefit of the dought. Make up is great though &amp; 20$ less than the stores. Plus you get more! The company reduced the amount you get but raised the price! So buy amazon it&#x27;ll save you $...thanks, gail</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Elizabeth Arden products . I always get compliments on my makeup.</li>
