### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Its awesome for curly hair</li>
      <li>It is perfect.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great for &amp;#34;normal hair.&amp;#34; TRY IT!!!!</li>
      <li>I take very good care of it.</li>
      <li>this helps - good luck with your hair product of choice!</li>
      <li>My hair looks great after using this product.</li>
      <li>This is a great conditioner, but may be mislabeled.</li>
      <li>AND if I&#x27;m having a good hair day.  </li>
      <li>Maybe its my hair type, but it just wasn&#x27;t good</li>
      <li>So my hair is very healthy &amp; moisturized</li>
      <li>I recommend it and I am happy to have it in my hair care regimen :)</li>
      <li>It smells nice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to give you a honest review ..</li>
      <li>I love this way more than DevaCurl and EO essentials!</li>
      <li>It is not the absolute best for defining curls (some of my hair is harder to define), but it is the BEST drugstore conditioner I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>and I am allergic to most of the &#x27;natural&amp;#34; products because they are often plant or flower based.</li>
      <li>And it was cheap!</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m buying some more.  </li>
      <li>Because it tangles, I need to brush, but as as soon as I brush, my hairs stand up because of the static.  </li>
      <li>For me the Pure Clean conditioner worked great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also frizz free, I love this and can&#x27;t rave anymore about this product.</li>
      <li>I do not like the strong perfum smell of this product but the smell gets lighter once you rinse it out.</li>
      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is fine.  </li>
      <li>My hair is super hydrated after just one use!  </li>
      <li>: This thing is huge, 28 ounces of conditioner is a lot of conditioner.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was cheap and available at my Bx.  </li>
      <li>With that shampoo it smelled fantastic.</li>
      <li>So if you are looking for something really light, this might not be the product for you - although you can control the amount you use &amp;</li>
      <li>and I enjoy it a lot.</li>
      <li>Not a typical conditioner that makes my hair feels good</li>
      <li>this product is environmentally friendly - that&#x27;s always a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re purchasing this because it&#x27;s CG method friendly, don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>The fragrance, while fresh, is a bit too strong.</li>
      <li>My hair type is known to be dry &amp; require a lot of moisture, but due to me taking great care of it, its in wonderful condition that&#x27;s why this Pure Clean conditioner works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Specially if you have curly hair(:</li>
      <li>It behaves itself, smells nice, and feels wonderfully soft, but it looks greasy, so I either have to hide it by pulling it up</li>
      <li>I can use this--just this--for a quick wash and wear style and my hair will feel and look moisturized after AIR DRYING</li>
      <li>I know this product isn&#x27;t organic like my other staple products but its silicone &amp; pariben free and has 3 or 4 different oils in it which is wonderful for my 4b/4c hair</li>
      <li>; conditioner and my hair is super soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft and my coils are so well defined that I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!!!!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more natural cleaner for my hair</li>
      <li>The scent smells really fresh</li>
      <li>I literally can&#x27;t remember another brand of conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever used, and at this point I&#x27;m just using Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Conditioner out of habit.</li>
      <li>Will I buy Pure Clean again ?</li>
      <li>so sometimes when I run out I need a cheaper priced item like this Pure Clean to help get me by.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any waxy build up like some of the other reviewers, my hair is nice and clean and healthy without being stripped of its natural oils when I use this conditioner as a co-wash.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this line of products and do not be roped into the environmentally friendly bit like I was, there are plenty of environmentally responsible shampoos/conditioners out there that work</li>
      <li>but this one went right in my trash tonight.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good price but not worth it.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty finicky and it takes some searching to get a product that works.  </li>
      <li>So my hair is overall extremely healthy and not picky with shampoos/conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first tried this when I showered at a friend&#x27;s place.  </li>
      <li>Garnier must LOVE making all their conditioners greasy, grimey, and residue-filled, because if they had tested this conditioner prior to putting it on the shelves, they wouldn&#x27;t have made it in the first place.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is definitely not a Garnier Fructis issue, as I have used other products and liked them a lot (I think my favorite has been the Triple Nutrition shampoo/conditioner)</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t oily, but more like wax, which was very strange.</li>
      <li>Believe it or not, I have found that it works much better than the Garnier products for dry hair.  </li>
      <li>, secondly I need my conditioner to be easy to squeeze out of a bottle.</li>
      <li>First day without it was fine, but since then my hair has been flat, tangled, and gets very static-y.  </li>
      <li>So, shampoo first, rinse clean, massage in conditioner, continue with the rest of your shower and rinse this out last.  </li>
      <li>No matter how much product I use, I cannot get it to coat my hair and add the slickness I expect from conditioner.</li>
      <li>Really like the smell</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I liked that it had very little</li>
      <li>You will get less frizz and more moisture.</li>
      <li>Total waste of money and a good shower.</li>
      <li>I can do a decent finger</li>
      <li>Once again, if you&#x27;re here because of the CG method, you&#x27;re better off buying something a tad bit more expensive to avoid all that hair pulling.</li>
      <li>Because I must use a lot of conditioner, lingering fragrances that are strong can give me a headache or compete with my other products.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I will admit that if it hydrates my hair, it will be too heavy for most.  </li>
      <li>and I hate that strong floral fresh note in so many brands!</li>
      <li>I put a good amount of this stuff on my head and massage it into my scalp, then I use my regular conditioner (organix coconut milk) on only the bottom half of my hair.</li>
      <li>Not to mention I let my hair air dry to avoid undo damage, and this took by no exaggeration about 4 times longer to dry than if I had used a more normal shampoo.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only giving this 2 stars because when first using this product I used it with another brand of shampoo I had to use up.</li>
      <li>I need my conditioner to first and foremost be present at the time of my shower</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the clarifying Pure Clean shampoo and one of the anti-dandruff Pure Clean shampoos, and they simply do what they say they will, with a bit less perfume than some other shampoos in the same price range.  </li>
      <li>This, along with the shampoo, does the complete opposite of making your hair \\&quot;pure clean\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I can only use it on my very ends.  </li>
      <li>B0002JNRCC Redken All Soft Conditioner Unisex Conditioner, 8.5 Ounce]]</li>
      <li>detangle with this product because it&#x27;s slippery enough to coat all of the hair relatively fast</li>
      <li>I have a sensitive nose</li>
      <li>This conditioner completely satisfies my hair-conditioning needs.</li>
      <li>So I decided to go ahead &amp; complete the duo &amp; get the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Pure Clean conditioner was heavy on my hair when I applied it while in the shower, but after rinsing it out my coils &amp; curls went back light weight, soft, &amp; moisturized as usual.</li>
      <li>I generally have silky soft hair and have never had this problem with any shampoo or conditioner before.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really not anywhere near as much work as it appears written.  </li>
      <li>I have 4b/4c natural hair, and I only use organic products.</li>
      <li>The last time my hair was this soft, I was using [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I have normal, if somewhat dry caucasian hair, and after I was done using this</li>
      <li>And so hard to rinse clean.</li>
      <li>If I choose, I can add gel afterward and it will still dry clear</li>

<li> This usually means an every-other-day wash, but there are weeks where I can go up to four days without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days, with this product, my hair REALLY needs a wash.  </li>
<li> There is no other word to describe it other than “sticky.”</li>
<li> If you have really dry, 4B/4C hair, definitely give this product a try!  </li>
<li> My rule is not to wash it if I haven&#x27;t worked out or spent time outside</li>
<li> I use this as a co-wash (I try avoiding shampoo as much as possible), I have Asian hair, it&#x27;s thick, dark, straight, and I have a ton of it.</li>
<li> It makes it pure weighed down, flat, stringy, greasy, and overall hard to manage.</li>
<li> I let my hair air dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to give you a honest review .. I have 4b/4c natural hair, and I only use organic products. Everyday I apply organic coconut oil to my hair, and at night I use shea butter on my hair before putting my satin cap before bed. My hair is not colored treated or chemically treated at all, and I do not use any type of heat after styling &amp; washing my hair. So my hair is very healthy &amp; moisturized cause I take very good care of it. I said all that so you reading the review will have a understanding why my hair does well with product. My hair type is known to be dry &amp; require a lot of moisture, but due to me taking great care of it, its in wonderful condition that&#x27;s why this Pure Clean conditioner works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organic products I use like cleansing conditioners, leave in&#x27;s, hair mask, &amp; styling products get a bit expensive so sometimes when I run out I need a cheaper priced item like this Pure Clean to help get me by. I know this product isn&#x27;t organic like my other staple products but its silicone &amp; pariben free and has 3 or 4 different oils in it which is wonderful for my 4b/4c hair texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pure Clean conditioner was heavy on my hair when I applied it while in the shower, but after rinsing it out my coils &amp; curls went back light weight, soft, &amp; moisturized as usual. For me the Pure Clean conditioner worked great. I do not like the strong perfum smell of this product but the smell gets lighter once you rinse it out. My hair looks great after using this product. Will I use this product everyday, no I will not cause I prefer organic products. But this product will be my go to product when I run out of my regular ones and need a temporary replacement. Will I buy Pure Clean again ? YES I WILL, cause my hair is not damaged, dry, or bad so adding this product sometime will not make my hair worse. I recommend it and I am happy to have it in my hair care regimen :)</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used(the shampoo is crap too), and I&#x27;ve used a ton of them. I have normal, if somewhat dry caucasian hair, and after I was done using this my hair felt so disgusting. It left what feels like a waxy buildup over each and every strand of hair, it was awful. It wasn&#x27;t oily, but more like wax, which was very strange. My hair looked dirty and awful, the color was dulled and you could see no highlights. Not to mention I let my hair air dry to avoid undo damage, and this took by no exaggeration about 4 times longer to dry than if I had used a more normal shampoo.   Do not buy this line of products and do not be roped into the environmentally friendly bit like I was, there are plenty of environmentally responsible shampoos/conditioners out there that work just fine, this however is awful and I don&#x27;t know how it even got on the market. Did they even freaking test this stuff before putting it out there?! I don&#x27;t think so!! I want my money back Garnier, these products suck.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this product got such a bad review.  My hair is pretty finicky and it takes some searching to get a product that works.  I found this product a year ago and I&#x27;ve stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, it takes some getting used to. Unlike other conditioners that I&#x27;ve just massaged in and then rinsed out right away, this one needs to stay in for a few minutes before you rinse it out.  So, shampoo first, rinse clean, massage in conditioner, continue with the rest of your shower and rinse this out last.  It&#x27;s really not anywhere near as much work as it appears written.  ^^;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I KNOW this stuff works because I ran out of this conditioner a week ago.  First day without it was fine, but since then my hair has been flat, tangled, and gets very static-y.  Because it tangles, I need to brush, but as as soon as I brush, my hairs stand up because of the static.  That has NEVER happened while I used this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this product is environmentally friendly - that&#x27;s always a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m buying some more.  Just saw the 1-star review and was shocked, so I thought I&#x27;d add another perspective while I here making my purchase.  I just wish I hadn&#x27;t waited a week.  I detest having to try brushing out tangles in my hair.  &gt;\\&quot;&amp;lt;</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural cleaner for my hair and I&#x27;m really sad to say (If I don&#x27;t like something I won&#x27;t rate it) it was bad enough that I need to let others know.  Maybe its my hair type, but it just wasn&#x27;t good, my hair felt grimy.</li>
    <li> I a military guy in my 30&#x27;s.  I bought this because it was cheap and available at my Bx.  I would never have thought in a million years I would be doing a review about a hair product...ever, but this stuff is simply awful.  I am not a picky person when it comes to conditioner by any means whatsoever.  But this crap is useless.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> Garnier must LOVE making all their conditioners greasy, grimey, and residue-filled, because if they had tested this conditioner prior to putting it on the shelves, they wouldn&#x27;t have made it in the first place. This, along with the shampoo, does the complete opposite of making your hair \\&quot;pure clean\\&quot;. It makes it pure weighed down, flat, stringy, greasy, and overall hard to manage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 2 stars because when first using this product I used it with another brand of shampoo I had to use up. With that shampoo it smelled fantastic. I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling my hair. And it was cheap! So I decided to go ahead &amp; complete the duo &amp; get the shampoo. Dum dum dum! Not the same. After only using for a few days my hair was oily. It felt strange when I blow dried it, so I stopped. Then came the funky ass smell! By the time a few days came &amp; went I had an oily scalp, dry ends &amp; a FISH HEAD smell coming from my hair!! Holy crap. I hope I can fix this. I usually don&#x27;t even give reviews but I had to do it for this product. Usually when I get tired of a shampoo or don&#x27;t like it enough I give it to someone else to try but this one went right in my trash tonight.</li>
    <li> Package arrived damaged and the conditioner is rather drying on my hair. Not a typical conditioner that makes my hair feels good</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re purchasing this because it&#x27;s CG method friendly, don&#x27;t. It smells nice, it&#x27;s cheap, and friendly towards the environment, but as conditioner it is horrible because it&#x27;s so hard to untangle your hair with it. You can still use it but you&#x27;ll have to use a quarter of the bottle if you intend on untangling your hair. This is coming from a person with thick curly hair though, so if you have a different hair type, perhaps this is for you. Once again, if you&#x27;re here because of the CG method, you&#x27;re better off buying something a tad bit more expensive to avoid all that hair pulling.</li>
    <li> This conditioner completely satisfies my hair-conditioning needs. I need my conditioner to first and foremost be present at the time of my shower, secondly I need my conditioner to be easy to squeeze out of a bottle. I literally can&#x27;t remember another brand of conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever used, and at this point I&#x27;m just using Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Conditioner out of habit. BUT I&#x27;ve never been dis-satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This thing is huge, 28 ounces of conditioner is a lot of conditioner. I&#x27;m talking a year + supply.</li>
    <li> I like Garnier Fructis shampoo/conditioner products, but this one was awful. I have very long, very thick hair that is generally easy to manage. I don’t use product in the my hair, I don’t use any type of heat (hair dryer, curling iron, etc.) on my hair. So my hair is overall extremely healthy and not picky with shampoos/conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, after just one use, my hair feels sticky, like there is something in it. Not oily, but some waxy building up or something. There is no other word to describe it other than “sticky.” And it actually feels like it’s drying out my hair. My hair also feels stringy. I generally have silky soft hair and have never had this problem with any shampoo or conditioner before. The conditioner did not “condition” or untangle my hair at all, so it was incredibly hard to comb through after my shower and difficult to manage. I haven’t ever had a conditioner perform that poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely not a Garnier Fructis issue, as I have used other products and liked them a lot (I think my favorite has been the Triple Nutrition shampoo/conditioner) so don’t read this as an indictment on the company, but this product was the worst I have ever had. I usually wash my hair every 2-3 days and had to wash it after work the same day because my hair felt so disgusting.</li>
    <li> I use this as a co-wash (I try avoiding shampoo as much as possible), I have Asian hair, it&#x27;s thick, dark, straight, and I have a ton of it. I put a good amount of this stuff on my head and massage it into my scalp, then I use my regular conditioner (organix coconut milk) on only the bottom half of my hair. I continue with my shower (wash body) and when I&#x27;m finished I will rinse my hair well. Then I wash my face and I&#x27;m done! The scent smells really fresh and I enjoy it a lot. I let my hair air dry. I don&#x27;t have any waxy build up like some of the other reviewers, my hair is nice and clean and healthy without being stripped of its natural oils when I use this conditioner as a co-wash. I only wish they had this in a coconut scent haha.</li>
    <li> Really like the smell and it helped my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I would give this zero stars if I could. No matter how much product I use, I cannot get it to coat my hair and add the slickness I expect from conditioner.</li>
    <li> Possibly the worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  No conditioning properties what so ever.  Total waste of money and a good shower.</li>
    <li> I have short African American hair (TWA) and my hair loves this stuff!!! I am using it for the maxhydration method even though it is not a recommended product.  I believe it is recommended for the curlygirl method.  My hair is super hydrated after just one use!  I have 4B/4C hair that is prone to knots &amp; will not retain length and I am allergic to most of the &#x27;natural&amp;#34; products because they are often plant or flower based. This conditioner is heavy......it has to be to work so well on my hair. So if you are looking for something really light, this might not be the product for you - although you can control the amount you use &amp; the amount of time you leave it in your hair.  Less conditioner and less time left on the hair may do the trick for you.  I took a chance and bought this product because of the price &amp; the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  If you have really dry, 4B/4C hair, definitely give this product a try!  My hair feels so soft and my coils are so well defined that I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I may be crazy but this conditioner makes our hair smell like rotten fish or something.  Three times we&#x27;ve used this.....same fish head smell results. Anyone else agree or am I crazy?  Chad</li>
    <li> I have been hunting for a conditioner that I can use and always know that my hair will be well hydrated. I have kinky curly hair--the majority of them are coils that around the size of ballpoint pen springs (some call this Type 4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- I can do a decent finger detangle with this product because it&#x27;s slippery enough to coat all of the hair relatively fast&lt;br /&gt;- I can use this--just this--for a quick wash and wear style and my hair will feel and look moisturized after AIR DRYING&lt;br /&gt;- If I choose, I can add gel afterward and it will still dry clear (I use Kinky Curly Curling Custard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- The fragrance, while fresh, is a bit too strong. I have a sensitive nose and I hate that strong floral fresh note in so many brands! Because I must use a lot of conditioner, lingering fragrances that are strong can give me a headache or compete with my other products.&lt;br /&gt;- It is not the absolute best for defining curls (some of my hair is harder to define), but it is the BEST drugstore conditioner I&#x27;ve used and so I will repurchase it.&lt;br /&gt;- Ingredients technically aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; like the name suggests, but I don&#x27;t mind this.</li>
    <li> If I would give this a zero if I could.  Horrible product.  Smelled disgusting (it does have smell and it smells bad), weird waxy feel, and made my hair look dull, lifeless, and sorta sticky feeling.  Disgusting.</li>
    <li> I first tried this when I showered at a friend&#x27;s place.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I liked that it had very little scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later I switched to some low-scent products, including this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is fine.  I&#x27;ve used the clarifying Pure Clean shampoo and one of the anti-dandruff Pure Clean shampoos, and they simply do what they say they will, with a bit less perfume than some other shampoos in the same price range.  Nothing earth-shattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the conditioner.  Holy Moses!  My hair loves it.  LOVES it.  The last time my hair was this soft, I was using [[ASIN:B0002JNRCC Redken All Soft Conditioner Unisex Conditioner, 8.5 Ounce]] for some absurd sum of money spent at a local salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see other reviewers complain it makes their hair look dirty or dark.  I have long, thick, mostly straight, unprocessed auburn hair that trends toward dry and/or frizzy, and I do notice that I have to wash my hair a little more often when I use this conditioner.  My rule is not to wash it if I haven&#x27;t worked out or spent time outside AND if I&#x27;m having a good hair day.  This usually means an every-other-day wash, but there are weeks where I can go up to four days without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days, with this product, my hair REALLY needs a wash.  It behaves itself, smells nice, and feels wonderfully soft, but it looks greasy, so I either have to hide it by pulling it up or I have to wash it earlier than I would otherwise.  I don&#x27;t know why that is so.  It&#x27;s still frizzy, but I have used every product on the face of this earth, and there will *always* be flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps - good luck with your hair product of choice!</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner, but may be mislabeled. I have a ton of corkscrew curls and use this everyday for well hydrated and shiny hair.  It is perfect. I will admit that if it hydrates my hair, it will be too heavy for most.  I recommend this for thick, dry and coarse hair.  Believe it or not, I have found that it works much better than the Garnier products for dry hair.  I think it is because there is no silicone or wax in the product which put a coating on the hair.  Moisture cannot penetrate a silicone barrier. It takes about 30 days to rinse the silicone out of your hair. It will make a big difference in the way a product will work going forward.  You will get less frizz and more moisture.</li>
    <li> I have type 3b curly hair and my hair works so well with this product. It compares to DevaCurl and surpassed my expectations! I love this way more than DevaCurl and EO essentials! The price can not be beat! Also, I use this in the shower then I apply the &amp;#34;Kinky Curly Knot Today&amp;#34; conditioner and my hair is super soft and smooth! It&#x27;s also frizz free, I love this and can&#x27;t rave anymore about this product. Although, they should tell curly hair curls to use this because it contains no silicones or parabens so the advertisement it wrong. Its awesome for curly hair I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great for &amp;#34;normal hair.&amp;#34; TRY IT!!!! Specially if you have curly hair(:</li>
    <li> I would not reccomend this product. I am African American and usually I say that has nothing to do with a lot of things, but it applies because of the difference in the texture of the hair. Usually we need a shampoo with some moisture because our hair can sometimes become very dry, and oils help that. This conditioner left my hair sticky and it felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in weeks, I ended up using the shampoo after the conditioner to get rid of the awful mess. Trust me it&#x27;s a good price but not worth it. It&#x27;s just taking up shelf space now, about to throw it away!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the conditioner only method.  Did not work. It is soooo greasy. And so hard to rinse clean. I can only use it on my very ends.  I would not purchase again.</li>
