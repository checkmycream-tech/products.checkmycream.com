      <li>I have been using it for years, and my stylist cannot believe how healthy my dyed hair is.</li>
      <li>It costs more than the product value.</li>
      <li>The conditioner you get with the haircolor is much more concentrated almost \\&quot;butter\\&quot; like.  </li>
      <li>glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>my favorite ever conditioner.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair smooth and silky!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s hands down the best conditioner I have come across-</li>
      <li>and I went on a quest for SOMETHING that would make my fine color-treated hair look like it once</li>
      <li>I was buying this at my hairdresser and the cost difference is quite huge.  </li>
      <li>This product is fabulous.  </li>

      <li>It made my coloured hair smooth and moisturised.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as good as that Japanese conditioner that I loved so much,</li>
      <li>I always thought the conditioner you get in the little package when you buy diy haircolor was the best and wondered why nobody thought to sell full sized versions.</li>
      <li>And it doesn&#x27;t really have a strong scent, but it smells just fine!</li>
      <li>I originally used this Feria Color Moisturizing Treatment which came with a hair color product.</li>
      <li>First used with boxed hair color and wanted more</li>
      <li>i was so excited to get the product</li>
      <li>Excellent product, I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, I love it, I highly recommend it...will buy again very soon,&lt;br /&gt;However,  when I placed the second order,  </li>

      <li>It leaves my hair so soft and looks amazing.</li>
      <li>My love affair with WEN ended a couple of years ago when the build up and expense got to be too much</li>
      <li>This conditioner, while good, is not the same.  </li>
      <li>The best hair condition for my thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this conditioner so much, I want to marry it.</li>
      <li>And it’s amazing how few of them out there can do that effectively.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product for anyone who has colored hair and is looking for something that really conditions your hair without that flat over conditioned look.</li>
      <li>I use this product regularly and love it!  </li>
      <li>I used to pay over $30.00 for a teeny weeny tube of this stuff from my hair dresser, but just a little made my hair look great</li>
      <li>It leaves it soft and manageable, shiny, and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>I have not found a better conditioner for keeping my hair feeling natural and minimizing split ends.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So happy to find this! It isn&#x27;t the exact same product as what comes in the dye box. But it is still really great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used the Feria hair color, so I&#x27;ve never tried the conditioner in the kit  My HG was a conditioner made by a Japanese company that was discontinued in about 2005.  I used to pay over $30.00 for a teeny weeny tube of this stuff from my hair dresser, but just a little made my hair look great no matter what shampoo I used.  If only I had known about this conditioner.  I&#x27;m sure it was available in 2005, but alas.  I went through a WEN phase as it seemed to be the only thing that took the tangles out of my hair and made it look decent.  Well...My love affair with WEN ended a couple of years ago when the build up and expense got to be too much and I went on a quest for SOMETHING that would make my fine color-treated hair look like it once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Feria at a beauty supplies store, and have been in \\&quot;Hair Heaven\\&quot; since. When I recently saw the price on Amazon, thought I would give it a try.  For those of you who may think it&#x27;s a little thick...try massaging it in working it from the ends on wet just shampooed and rinsed hair. You can also use it alone right after coloring, but have never tried it that way.  This stuff never leaves any build-up, smells great, and saves my fine hair from breakage.  It&#x27;s as good as that Japanese conditioner that I loved so much, it&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to find.  I also look like a hair model. Woo Hoo!  This stuff is great.  I plan to try the Feria Shimmering highlights set (I color AND highlight my own hair), so I can compare this conditioner with that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HTH&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Rumor has it that this product is discontinued. My hair is going to be so *&amp;#@&#x27;d with out it.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner 2-5 times a week for the past 3 years. It&#x27;s hands down the best conditioner I have come across- and I have tried many. I highlight my hair, so I need something that protects the color as well makes my hair managable and soft without weighing it down. This product fits the bill. It keeps my hair in great shape- expecially since I can&#x27;t get to the salon as often as I like. Highly recommended conditioner.</li>
    <li> I always thought the conditioner you get in the little package when you buy diy haircolor was the best and wondered why nobody thought to sell full sized versions. FINALLY Loreal did. This is the wonderful conditioner that come with the Feria hair color and it detangles and make my hair feel lovely</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this conditioner after using the Feria hair coloring.  It came packaged with it.  Just a tiny bit does the job for short hair and also works wonders for long!  Try it...you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I have ever used! I have been using it for years, and my stylist cannot believe how healthy my dyed hair is.</li>
    <li> shipping came quite fast.  i was so excited to get the product but when i tried it.......I didn&#x27;t get the same sense I felt when I used the Feria shimmering conditioner that comes in the Feria color treatment product.  It&#x27;s definitely not the same product.  A little disappointed with the quality.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the best hair conditioner for colored hair. This formulation is better now than what ships with Feria Hair Color.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizing treatment for years. Over processed once and found this product. Now whenever I need deep moisturizing this is the product I use, even my husband uses it. Hope they never discontinue this one.</li>
    <li> I buy it over and over. It is a great conditioner. I have blood hair and this treatment activates highlights and moisturizers great. I use it as a conditioner. A little secret you can use it as a washing conditioner better than Wen</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous.  My hair was so dry and flyaway, this was the answer!</li>
    <li> my favorite ever conditioner. i only wish they sold a larger size! Leaves hair smooth and silky! Even with my repeated heat damage!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for years.  I used to be able to buy it locally, but since I moved to the outer reaches of the earth, I must have it sent to me.  I think that says alot for the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, I have used it twice, didn&#x27;t quite notice the moisture or the shine.  I did notice my hair feels stronger though.</li>
    <li> I am so glad they sell this in a tube. I have been squeezing the last drops out of the tiny tubes that come with my hair color and thus I wanted to have more. This helps keep my hair conditioned and soft.  I totally recommend this to anyone with any type of hair</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, makes my hair feel great. Have never been able to find it in stores, so was really pleased to find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Not quite as thick as the ones that come in the hair dye box.  Still good but was expecting a thicker formula.</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  I color my hair a lot which sometimes dries it out.  Feria leaves my hair shiny,smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000A3ZN8G Loreal Feria Color Treatment 6 oz. Tube]]&lt;br /&gt;I started to like Loreal&#x27;s Feria color treatment because I have been using the one comes with the color Dye. It works so well and leaves your hair organized and the color stay shine and real. And it doesn&#x27;t really have a strong scent, but it smells just fine! I really love this product.</li>
    <li> I used to use a treament which really worked for my hair before moving to USA. Then I could not find the same product and tried many treatments of around $10-20 in the so-called \\&quot;professional\\&quot; range. But none of them worked on my damaged hair. I originally used this Feria Color Moisturizing Treatment which came with a hair color product. I liked it and searched it online to see if I could buy it separately. Then my search&#x27;s over. This makes my hair moist, smooth, soft and easy to handle whereas most of others I tried were just greesy and hard to rinse off and made my hair hard like wire. I love this product!</li>
    <li> This is so far the best conditioner I have used. It is a littler bit pricy. But unlike other ones you can find in supermarket, this one is very thick. So the price per use is not expensive at all. Also, I bought twice form this seller (cos.. solution). The product was carefully packed and fast deliver.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! Have to say this is the best conditioner I have ever used!</li>
    <li> One of the best product hands down on the market for my long colored dry hair, especially considering the price.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly and love it!  it&#x27;s the same conditioner that comes with the Feria hair color except this is a much larger tube that will last for a while, it only takes a small amount for your hair.</li>
    <li> As a professional hairdresser I really like product. It&#x27;s a great detangler, smells good, and makes your hair smooth and shiny. Nice at defrizzing if you let air dry after conditioning. Great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is not the same as what you receive with Feria haircolor.  The conditioner you get with the haircolor is much more concentrated almost \\&quot;butter\\&quot; like.  This conditioner, while good, is not the same.  It is a lighter feeling conditioner and the fragrance is different.  It is not a bad conditioner; it works fairly well. It is just not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I am a Swimmer and this is the only product I have found that helps my hair recover from the damage - I use it daily and it does not build up on your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the best conditioner out there. Leaves my hair soft with never any build up. I really love it.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing hair but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s same formula as conditioner that comes in the kit.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product and I have given it as a gift on several occasions ! It makes my hair shine like no other product</li>
    <li> well it stripped my hair off all the red dye i put in. messed up the color. The highlights it promised did not happen. Just an absence of color that i worked hard to put in. It doesn&#x27;t even moisturize that well! ya did not help my damaged hair. This was so expensive too! ugh useless</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, I love it, I highly recommend it...will buy again very soon,&lt;br /&gt;However,  when I placed the second order,  I was very disappointed,  the item that I purchased went up by 100%, the have the same item listed under 2 different prices,  very misleading,  and even thou I told them,  they did not change it,  becareful with this co,  make sure that if you buy something from them,  that the price is correct... .</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Orea&#x27;ls  Feria is the only moisturizer i will use on my hair.  It is the best of all  conditioners!!!</li>
    <li> found this hair moisturizer when using Feria hair color. l Loved it ! then discovered that it could be bought separately in a much, much larger size tube. I have been using this product for a few years. Unfortunately Feria seems to be disappearing from the market, as does this separate excellent creme hair moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone might recommend another product that you have recently discovered...I would appreciate learning about it.</li>
    <li> An excellent product I have used for years that was ordered and delivered promptly. Mahalo</li>
    <li> very nice, but it is different from the moisturizer you get in the actual Feria 3D hair colour boxes - these are a little runny and thinner and definitely not the same quality or ingredients as what is in the hair colour box unfortunately.  But still better than regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is an Excellent product! I have coarse color treated hair and it makes it smooth. My hairdresser approved too</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, and dye it every six to eight weeks.  I have not found a better conditioner for keeping my hair feeling natural and minimizing split ends.  Using this conditioner 3x in a week re-mosturizes my hair and repairs the damage that is inevitable from coloring.  I have naturally very oily hair, so I don&#x27;t use so much by my scalp, but concentrate on the ends and rinse well.  It&#x27;s a shame that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make this in a larger size, but still, with hair down to my waist, a bottle lasts me about a month at 3x per week.</li>
    <li> Premium conditioner, leaves hair smooth, silky and shiny</li>
    <li> Great product line! Instantly detangles my chemically treated hair!</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner for years!  I color my hair quite often and it&#x27;s the only conditioner that even comes close to working...It&#x27;s almost, but not quite, the same conditioner you find in the Loreal Hair color...</li>
    <li> This conditioner is exactly what my hair needed.  I color my hair and this works exactly like the little tube you get in the Feria at-home coloring kit.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love love love love this stuff!!!! I have tried everything on my hair and my hair was always like horse hay always dry brittle I hated it. I came across this stuff on here and decided heck why not I&#x27;ve tried everything else. I wanted a conditioner like the ones that come in the hair color kits they are the only thing that ever made my hair somewhat manageable... I got this stuff and have been using it for the last month and wow what a change for the first time in forever I actually can wear my hair down because I&#x27;m not embarrassed by it. It leaves my hair so soft and looks amazing. It does not weigh your hair down and leave it greasy looking. Amazing just amazing I love it. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase I&#x27;m actually heads to buy more as we speak</li>
    <li> It smells nice, and keeps my hair smooth and shiny. Works better than the conditioner that I was buying before discovering this product.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner I have found that actually performs the same as the conditioners in the color boxes. Leaves my hair super soft and shiny with no fly aways or tangle problems.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous conditioner.  It does not leave your hair greasy but it leaves it smooth and shiny. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> This is the only condition I can use. I have pretty damaged hair and after using Thus daily... my hair finally feels so healthy again.</li>
    <li> Great product. It made my coloured hair smooth and moisturised. The only problem is the shipping value. It costs more than the product value.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable product. I used to buy the hair color just for the conditioner. I have fine, damaged hair and it looks fantastic now!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good, leaves your hair smooth and silky but I doubt it does much long term real conditioning. Just kinda coats the hair to make it appear smother.</li>
    <li> Felt good on hair at first, then began to make hair feel dryer and straw like. My hairs curly and frizzy&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t recommend for thick hair</li>
    <li> Best 3 min conditioner out there but hard to get at beautiful places&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner so much, I want to marry it. My hair is pretty heavily highlighted, and as a result, it&#x27;s becoming straw-like and fried-looking and generally unattractive. I ordered this stuff based on reviews on Makeup Alley, and holy cow, it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s pretty heavy, so maybe not best use for every day. That said, I have very thin, fine hair, and I use it every day with no problems. Just use a clarifying shampoo every once in awhile to avoid build-up. This stuff is the bomb-diggity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used some of the most expensive salon conditioners and honestly nothing compares to this.  This stuff is truly the best!</li>
    <li> clairol conditioner much better...high in price...did nothing for hair rather thick to put on and rinse..wld not buy again..hard to rinse out of hair</li>
    <li> This is an incredible find.  I was buying this at my hairdresser and the cost difference is quite huge.  This is a great product for anyone who has colored hair and is looking for something that really conditions your hair without that flat over conditioned look.</li>
    <li> A little goes a LONG way.  I have thin, straight.hair.  It does the job without weighing the hair down.  Great price also. Smart buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a large version of the conditioner that comes with Feria hair color. Reviews I read indicated this was it. This is good conditioner, but is definitely not the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this for years.  Very happy with the product.  I just use a light amount of product every other day and never have a problem with it weighing down my hair.  First used with boxed hair color and wanted more so I got this from a small chain beauty store.  Found this on amazon for the same price.  Very pleased with my purchase and will continue using for years to come...  Especially great for my daughter with thin, baby fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
    <li> The best hair condition for my thick hair.  Amazon sells it much cheaper than the beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> There is a good chance that L’Oreal is going to discontinue this, and it’s one of the best hair conditioners that I’ve ever used. But I recently discovered L’Oreal’s new product called Total Repair 5 restoring conditioner with ceramide.  It’s even better than the Feria Professional and costs a lot less.  I was very unsure at first, because you buy the Total Repair 5 at a drugstore or supermarket, and long ago, I gave up buying conditioners at these places because they don’t do anything except go down the drain.  The Total Repair 5 is impressive, though.  I also tried Total Repair Extreme reconstructing conditioner but it had mineral oil in it, which stuck to my hair like glue and I felt like I needed to wash it out as soon as I put it on. Honestly, I thought mineral oil was “old school” and nobody would ever put that into a hair conditioner anymore because of the mess it will make in your hair.  Clearly, that conditioner is not for everyone.  However, the Total Repair 5 is smoother and creamier and does a better job of detangling than the Feria Professional. With hair conditioners, it’s always a delicate balance of having to wash out enough from your hair, and yet some of it has to stay on your hair in order to properly “condition.”  And it’s amazing how few of them out there can do that effectively.  L’Oreal seems to know something that other manufacturers don’t in that regard.  If you use a coupon and get the Total Repair 5 conditioner when it’s on sale, it won’t cost very much at all just to try it.</li>
    <li> The Best! No build up I use everyday mixed with a cheaper product.  Love it Sally&#x27;s quit carrying glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great, moisturizes well, and leaves my hair incredibly shiny.  This is the only conditioner that works to detangle my long hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve found for my hair.  It leaves it soft and manageable, shiny, and healthy looking.</li>
