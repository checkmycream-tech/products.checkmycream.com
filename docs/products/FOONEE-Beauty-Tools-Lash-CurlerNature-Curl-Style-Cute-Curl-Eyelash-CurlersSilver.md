      <li>It isn&#x27;t the greatest in the world, it tends to pinch my eyelashes a lot</li>
      <li>but after that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>

      <li>so it came like 2 weeks before it was suppose to so thats a great plus.</li>
      <li>This eyelash curler is great.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be amazing at that price!</li>
      <li>and yet it does its job perfectly! :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the best of its kind, but for the price, it works amazingly well</li>
      <li>I feel like this curler is really good quality.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend buying a good, branded one from the store</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with this purchase</li>

      <li>Very happy with my order and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>it is really nice</li>
      <li>This was very nice but didn&#x27;t fit my eye.</li>
      <li>Very cheap</li>
      <li>Cheap and it works!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a great product with a reasonable price</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll love it as soon as I get the hang of it</li>
      <li>It was supposed to come at latest June 29</li>
      <li>so I was really happy about that as far as the curler itself</li>
      <li>It curls easily too so you don&#x27;t have to do it over and over like with some curlers.</li>
      <li>Works fine just what I needed</li>
      <li>I got 2 for such a great price</li>
      <li>but so far the lash curler isnt good .</li>
      <li>just little to be send, if it can be more fast will be better, it is useful, best choose for girl</li>
      <li>It took a long time to arrive but it is a great lash curler.</li>
      <li>For the cheap price, definitely a good basic eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Overall, I would say it is a good product for the price.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be so lucky to get them out still attached to your lid.  </li>
      <li>If you need an eyelash curler, this is a fine and reasonably priced purchase.</li>
      <li>A great little curler for the money.</li>
      <li>it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>the other hand, the company did send me a free cable tie, which, incidentally, I do use &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>To be so inexpensive these work pretty we.</li>
      <li>I will most likely not use this product.</li>
      <li>This just came in, and I just used it for the first time.</li>
      <li>It has no extra refill like most curlers.  </li>
      <li>works exactly like they should</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to buy a couple more to stash away</li>
      <li>Junk broke on first day</li>
      <li>The price is good and reasonable, the wait was not worth it.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>absolutely terrible.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received it pretty early</li>
      <li>I expected it to be like my friend&#x27;s cheap curler who doesn&#x27;t work very well, but it wasn&#x27;t like that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, when you put something this close to your eye, just spend a little bit more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since it was coming from a different country and since free shipping was offered, I thought that this was going to take a pretty long time to be delivered.</li>
      <li>I have monolids and most eyelash curlers pinch my eyes due their too big.</li>
      <li>This curler works just as good as my older sister&#x27;s expensive one.</li>
      <li>Not the best at all pretty bad material would try other products from niceeshop</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll edit this when I find out I heard other people&#x27;s curlers broke easily and came in a package with Spanish in permanent marker but mine</li>
      <li>(oh well, those are commonly replaced), there are too many wide-open or unfinished edges.  </li>
      <li>i ended up just using the rubber insert in an old eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>It will not give you this extreme curl look, but it does it the right amount for me.</li>
      <li>Not super fantastic, but definitely gets the job done.</li>
      <li>same old, same old.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that annoying lip at the top that so many have that bend long lashes forward.</li>
      <li>Nothing too special to report here, but there&#x27;s certainly nothing wrong with it, either.</li>

<li> takes a long time to get.</li>
<li> It actually came in about a week and a half.</li>
<li> i just dont like that it dosent come with a replacement of the little white thing</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it gets the job done</li>
<li> The Thing Is really hard to use i barely get any lashes on 5 tries, but you get what you pay for!</li>
<li> The metal part that comes down against the lashes is... sharp.</li>
<li> Other than that, it came two weeks before the estimated delivery date!</li>
<li> Seriously, I tried using this several times just being stubborn thinking</li>
<li> Grabbed my eyelashes slightly, but it curled well.</li>
<li> It takes a little bit of &amp;#34;warming up&amp;#34; and getting used to (a little less than a week)</li>
<li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
<li> so I use them everyday!</li>
<li> I feel like I got not control and definitely no more pinching.</li>
<li> This means that almost every time you release your lashes from curling, at least a few lashes will get caught in between two metal pieces</li>
<li> I learned the hard way to go ahead and splurge a bit on a lash curler.  </li>
<li> The black plastic tend to fall apart!!!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also a bit difficult to get all my lashes and takes 2-3 times to curl.</li>
<li> Besides the pads being very thin and tearing almost immediately</li>
<li> I guess I should have known the quality would be bad judging by the price, it came broken</li>
<li> I got so mad</li>

    <li> This just came in, and I just used it for the first time. Grabbed my eyelashes slightly, but it curled well. It&#x27;s also a bit difficult to get all my lashes and takes 2-3 times to curl. Other than that, it came two weeks before the estimated delivery date! Seems like a steal for the price.</li>

    <li> same old, same old.  takes a long time to get.</li>
    <li> I have monolids and most eyelash curlers pinch my eyes due their too big. This is gest if you have asian eyes. I feel like I got not control and definitely no more pinching.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. The price is good and reasonable, the wait was not worth it. I&#x27;d recommend buying a good, branded one from the store</li>

    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve been searching for a great product with a reasonable price and I found that at niceEshop. Very happy with my order and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works just like you&#x27;d expect an eyelash curler to work. Nothing too special to report here, but there&#x27;s certainly nothing wrong with it, either. If you need an eyelash curler, this is a fine and reasonably priced purchase.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have known the quality would be bad judging by the price, it came broken I didn&#x27;t even have the chance to use it once...</li>
    <li> I feel like this curler is really good quality. I expected it to be like my friend&#x27;s cheap curler who doesn&#x27;t work very well, but it wasn&#x27;t like that. It works!</li>
    <li> The black plastic tend to fall apart!!!! I got so mad</li>
    <li> where in the world is this curler? don&#x27;t buy from this buyer just go to walmart or taget and forget this buyer who will only steal your money and never sends the product out!</li>
    <li> I learned the hard way to go ahead and splurge a bit on a lash curler.  Besides the pads being very thin and tearing almost immediately (oh well, those are commonly replaced), there are too many wide-open or unfinished edges.  This means that almost every time you release your lashes from curling, at least a few lashes will get caught in between two metal pieces and you&#x27;ll be so lucky to get them out still attached to your lid.  Seriously, I tried using this several times just being stubborn thinking I could work around it, and now I am waiting for my eyelashes to grow back....absolutely terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, when you put something this close to your eye, just spend a little bit more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the company did send me a free cable tie, which, incidentally, I do use &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Cheap and it works! I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it gets the job done</li>
    <li> Junk broke on first day</li>
    <li> I received it pretty early I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good yet but I&#x27;ll edit this when I find out I heard other people&#x27;s curlers broke easily and came in a package with Spanish in permanent marker but mine came in Japanese it looks like it could be flimsy but I can&#x27;t judge a book by its cover yet until I&#x27;ve opened it and tried it  it also came with a blue Velcro band I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s for though</li>
    <li> The metal part that comes down against the lashes is... sharp. I fear it will chop them off- LOL! I will most likely not use this product.</li>
    <li> just little to be send, if it can be more fast will be better, it is useful, best choose for girl</li>
    <li> This curler works just as good as my older sister&#x27;s expensive one. Very cheap and yet it does its job perfectly! :)</li>
    <li> works exactly like they should</li>
    <li> It took a long time to arrive but it is a great lash curler. It doesn&#x27;t have that annoying lip at the top that so many have that bend long lashes forward. I got 2 for such a great price it was worth the wait. It curls easily too so you don&#x27;t have to do it over and over like with some curlers.</li>
    <li> i ended up just using the rubber insert in an old eyelash curler. you get what you pay for, i guess.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money.  It has no extra refill like most curlers.  And the pad ripped after only a week.</li>
    <li> This was very nice but didn&#x27;t fit my eye. It was to big and I couldn&#x27;t get it angled to my eye.</li>
    <li> Love this! Had it almost a year and it&#x27;s still held together and keeps my lashes curled all day</li>
    <li> A great little curler for the money. Not super fantastic, but definitely gets the job done.</li>
    <li> For the cheap price, definitely a good basic eyelash curler. It isn&#x27;t the greatest in the world, it tends to pinch my eyelashes a lot but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be amazing at that price!</li>
    <li> Since it was coming from a different country and since free shipping was offered, I thought that this was going to take a pretty long time to be delivered. It actually came in about a week and a half. As for the product, it curls my eyelashes enough. It will not give you this extreme curl look, but it does it the right amount for me. Overall, I would say it is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Took forever and it broke like a week later...so don&#x27;t buy it wast of time and money.</li>
    <li> Not the best at all pretty bad material would try other products from niceeshop but so far the lash curler isnt good .</li>
    <li> Works fine just what I needed</li>
