<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Extremely thin, very shiny, would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I needed a Halloween wig this year, but Wal-Mart wigs are ugh. I&#x27;ve gotten a wig from Cool2Day before so I knew I&#x27;d get some sort of quality. The back of the wig cap is very noticeable when putting my fingers on it. It&#x27;s extremely shiny. But it&#x27;s much better then Wal-Mart, and I&#x27;m going to get it cut and fitted properly soon. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be perfect and it&#x27;s for Halloween so the rating is for that.</li>
    <li> I like this wig because it&#x27;s very lightweight, despite the nice length of hair it doesn&#x27;t slip off because of it&#x27;s weight, my other long wigs never stay on securely no matter how I tighten them because of their weight. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the hairs are shiny and plastic looking in some lights, and they don&#x27;t cut like normal hair or my nicer quality wigs. Still, it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s lightweight, and I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig! It&#x27;s my first one and I was a bit skeptical on the whole matter, but I&#x27;ve been wearing it around my house to get used to the feel and I&#x27;m almost ready to go out in public with it! I love the fact that it came a whole two weeks ahead of the given arrival date. It came in good condition, the price was a steal, and the experience is exceptional overall!</li>
    <li> I love this wig like it feels good it looks great people always asking me what are you mixt with i love it the hair is like human hair i will be buying more wigs :)</li>
    <li> This wig is worth your money. I paid &#x27;bout 7 dollars for it and it looks better than some of my more pricier wigs. It is a bit shiny, but nothing too bad. It is soft and sheds a tad, but not so much where it is a problem. It&#x27;s light and thin, so you can wear during summer time. One problem I have is that it does not have combs, other than that, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> So this is my first wig I ever bought. It&#x27;s a wig just for laughs, so I don&#x27;t expect much from it in regard to quality or realism. The wig arrived with the hair completely straight, but it gets tangled very easily. I don&#x27;t know much about wig care, but after a few uses, it looks like you woke up with terrible bed hair! (I have no idea how the person in the picture wears the wig so flawlessly!) The wig also came with a hair net and the wig has an elastic strap inside for fitting and stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, because of the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it for those who want to use it for a costume party or cosplay: shiny, light weight, and adjustable.</li>
    <li> I just received this wig in the mail a whole week and a half before the estimated arrival, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problems that I&#x27;ve experienced were...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty big and feels loose. (I have a pretty small head though!)&lt;br /&gt;It sheds. (I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s because of the length, but a lot of strands fall out. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, It&#x27;s a great wig! It looks really natural, and doesn&#x27;t feel plasticy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDL;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Really nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy again and recommend! :D</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t all that great. It was way too long and after two weeks the ends of the wig got really nappy. I had to cut it several times because it got so bad. Also the wig cap that came with it was really itchy. The wig itself was kinda itchy too but not as bad as the wig cap.</li>
    <li> This is such a cute wig, for a great price. It&#x27;s good quality, good color, and a good fit. Will do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> To start, this is my very first wig...EVER. So I can&#x27;t really compare it to much else except for what I see in stores. In stores, I see a lot of wigs that look very \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot; for about triple the cost, but I was sooooo surprised when I got this wig that it was so soft and the style and cut are so natural looking!!! As well, the hair is SUPER soft and glides right through the fingers. So far, I have worn the wig twice (all day) and it is very comfortable and feels secure (after figuring out how to tighten with the straps). The only worry I have is that I&#x27;m not sure how long the hair will last/stay nice,(it has tangled some already so I worry a bit) but I will see. I love the price and the quality and the price is well beneath the quality so that&#x27;s always a plus!!! Overall, I LOVE the wig so far, just waiting to see how it lasts.</li>
    <li> The quality of the wig was a pleasant surprise for such a great price. I was half expecting a messy wig to arrive, but it looks absolutely great! Very soft, easy to brush and manage, looks and feels natural. Love it!</li>
    <li> When I got the wig I was disappointed, I pulled it out of the bag and it already was tangled and knotted. When I went to brush it hair started to come off of it, and I had a handful of hairs before I had even done half of it. Material is very shiny and felt like plastic. Tried to wear it and it got all tangled again just in the process of putting it on so I took it off.&lt;br /&gt;Quality seems similar to the kind of wig you would get out of a cheap superstore Halloween costume.</li>
    <li> The color and style is similar to the picture, but the netting is very uneven and has odd lumps in the back.&lt;br /&gt;Only looks good when wearing a hood or hat- very obvious that it&#x27;s a wig otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Still soft and silky texture, with nice color. Just too shiny.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> The wig was very pretty but it didn&#x27;t last very long. The first night that I wore it, it started to tangle within 5 mins of me wearing it.</li>
    <li> So I got this wig mainly because I like the 3-5 day shipping. What I didnt realize was that it took THEM 3-5 days to ship the item... not YOULL get it in 3-5 days. Tons of their wigs say 4-5 weeks before shipping which was what detoured me from getting some of the OTHER wigs that I fell in love with, but thats not the review for THIS WIG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is amazing. It feels amazing, it glides through my fingers well, I love the length. I normally wear hair extensions so this was a much more affordable cost to go buying hair extensions which cost anywhere from $60-120.00 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it on the 23rd, and it got shipped out on the 30th... but was recieved today. I love it. It took me a minute to part the bangs properly (I didnt like them flat straight) but it was easy to push them to the side and make them look amazing, like in the photograph. I really REALLY like these! I assure you, I will be purchasing more wigs from them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend and 2 of my girlfriends have already seen me in them and agree they look super natural, and I have thin hair, so this really adds some life and length to my hair! THANK YOU SO MUCH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also, when this item ships...it says shipping thru EMS shipping. I tried putting in the confirmation number and it didnt go through for some reason, so I got super concerned that something had gone wrong, but they were SUPER quick to respond back to me, sent me quite a few emails asking me if I had gotten it and sure enough it came a few days earlier than the EXPECTED DATE... so dont worry if it doesnt pop up on EMS shipping. Itll come to you :)</li>
    <li> Nice and cheap. Great for a halloween costume, but this wig is like Doll hair and tangles just as easily. Didn&#x27;t even get one wear out of it. Just trying it on had it so tangled, I gave up and threw it away.</li>
    <li> It came on time, and it was in perfect condition, but the wig shads and there was some waviness in the hair, but over all it was great, Thank you!</li>
    <li> Pros:  Arrived quickly, low price---no problem with the sellers, just the actual wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Frizzed really bad the first day! Will have to cut quite a bit off of it and I&#x27;m sure it will continue to frizz.  Guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t purchase this type of wig again.</li>
    <li> Last year, I bought this wig for personal use, like cosplay and Gothic Lolita. It took about two-three weeks to get to my place, which isn&#x27;t so bad when you buy something from Asia. It&#x27;s one of my preferred wigs for a natural look! It is on the thin side, and at times, I have to un-clip it from the back because the wig cap is a bit smaller than my head, so just keep that in mind. However, the good thing about it being so thin is that I used it for our summer con (Nan Desu Kan) and it bothered me less than a thicker wig. The only drawback is, yes, it tangles easily. I do straighten it when I can and I have to use a really big tooth comb or brush to keep it smooth. I will carry a brush in my bag whenever I wear this to keep it thin. It is a bit long, so I did trim it. But nonetheless, I love it, it&#x27;s a good wig. The fibers are super smooth like my natural hair -- but then again, mine is very thin.</li>
    <li> So I bought this wig really just wanting a black wig that I could wear for cosplay and just for fun in general. I have to say I was REALLY concerned when I looked at the reviews but when it came in the mail I was very pleased. It is a bit longer than the picture (which I thought was nice) and it felt like my other nice quality wigs. It is definitely small but it works for me. It does tangle but I mean what long wig doesn&#x27;t get a few tangles after a day of wear. Just condition it and it should be good. Overall this wig was really great and I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Very soft, softer then my other wigs of the same material. Everyone thinks its my normal hair, the bangs are kind of odd 70&#x27;s style but they are left long so I will just have them cut.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! It fit very well and came with its own hair net</li>
    <li> Dont get it, its a waste of time and money&lt;br /&gt;for one thing its too small to fit someone with a big head&lt;br /&gt;it sheds alot, and I mean it ALOT&lt;br /&gt;it shed right when I opened it, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving it to my younger cousin to play with because I just couldnt stand it anymore.</li>
    <li> I really like this wig. It looks very natural. I bought another wig from Cool2day and i absolutely loved it. I would have given 5 stars for this one if it wasn&#x27;t so loose(even with the adjustable straps). When i first got it i had to put booby pins to keep it in place but still didn&#x27;t feel very confident that it wouldn&#x27;t fall off. I had to criss-cross the adjustable straps to make it fit better. Other than the looseness this wig is amazing!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Took about a month to get here, but overall good quality. The fibers are soft and not TOO shiny. The bangs come parted down the middle not to the side like in the picture, but with a little maneuvering you can fix that.</li>
    <li> Looks natural...Though a little difficult to handle because of the length, fits fine and looks great! Delivered promptly within stated time frame.</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely fantastic if you know what you&#x27;re doing when it comes to wigs. The fibers are very soft and aren&#x27;t as shiny as your typical cheap wigs. The fibers have only tangled mildly despite me having have worn it to hell and back since I got it. It&#x27;s a very nice fit to my head, and is very easy to maintain. Must I need another long black wig I will return here!</li>
    <li> long and easy to comb. not tangly at all like some wigs are.  just a little too thin for my tastes.</li>
    <li> Crazy thin and not well made. Good for one time wear only!!!</li>
    <li> not as long as I was hoping, but one of the best quality wigs i&#x27;ve won for cheap</li>
    <li> This wig took a little while to show up, but it did arrive prior to the estimate. (I think it was roughly 3 weeks or so.) The hair feels very soft, and it&#x27;s actually pretty thick. I bought it for a Halloween costume that didn&#x27;t work out, but I&#x27;ll definitely be wearing it in the future!</li>
    <li> This wig was amazing when I got it. It still is, but it has shed some hair, not that much though. The fringe was really wierd looking so I cut it to a straight fringe instead because it looked better. Oh and if you didn&#x27;t get that the title of this review is a quote from the movie Mean Girls, I hate you. But yeah it&#x27;s a nice wig.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great for what you are paying for. It sheds a lot but its no problem for me. I totally revamped the wig and it my own. It curled well damp and at about 145°-150°F. Also added some colorful braiding hair to it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look real. I don&#x27;t like it. Doesn&#x27;t stay on my head either. I look very funny when I try it on.</li>
    <li> I really love this wig it feels amazing so soft and sliky and real it look cheap but After I out it on I luved it, I don&#x27;t like that the cap is kinda small.</li>
    <li> This wig is really soft and looks like real hair. I did not give it 5 stars because a lock of hair from the bangs fell off and  when I move the bangs to the side it would show little short hairs underneath the bangs and just makes it look ugly, but if the bangs are left unpin then the short hairs underneath the bangs will not show. Other than that the wig is itself is great and I just love how soft and real it looks!</li>
    <li> It is thin and too obvious it&#x27;s fake</li>
    <li> It was a cute little fun wig just to wear sometimes it&#x27;s not an everyday wig but it was really cute!</li>
    <li> It came to my home early and was everything i hoped for and more i was glad i was able to receive it</li>
    <li> I bought this wig once and I liked it until on the 3rd day of me wearing it the straps both fell off, i thought it would be ok. So it wont be as snug as i want it.... that night went to take it off and the front and back fell apart!!!! I messaged them and told them they offered me a refund or to ship out another one... So i opted for another one. November 20 it was shipped, here it is Dec 21st and still NO WIG!!! Don&#x27;t do it! Go somewhere else to get your product if you want to receive you product and a quality product! I did receive a refund, that&#x27;s the only thing good that came out of this!</li>
    <li> i am a wig collector who has to say this feels ultra realistic go swap your gender or identity with confidence</li>
    <li> surprisingly, this is one of the cheapest but overall the best wig I have ordered from Cool2day. The bangs are PERFECT and need ZERO styling. The hair is silky, soft, but not fake looking. The wig cap isnt super tight, and the seller included a wig cap also. would definitely buy another</li>
    <li> Wig looks great! It&#x27;s a bit knotted and I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but two thumbs up!:)</li>
    <li> For the price was very smooth and glossy and almost looked real! I bought this for a witch costume I am planing for October. I wanted a victorian/romantic look and this wig was perfect. It goes down to the middle of my back and fits my head well. (Female, 21, 189 lbs) also shipping was fast and it came well packaged. It brushes well with very few hairs falling out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good wig. It looks like a expensive nice one, bt it&#x27;s price is good and low. The bangs look different on every person. Some people they&#x27;re too short and some they&#x27;re too long but a little adjusting can fix it. It comes with a bald cap. I&#x27;m over all happy with the wig.</li>
    <li> Its a nice wig, comes long and you have to cut it to your liking. It sheds a little as all wigs.</li>
    <li> This is a great wig, but it has no string adjustments to fit your head, a couple of hair pins can fix that. Overall it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> It took over 3 months to be delievered to my house when it said it would be there in one. When I did receive the wig, I was very exited to style it and wear it. However, when I did put it on to style it, the bangs were parted. But of course, it was going to be no big deal after I styled it. Although, I worked on the bangs the most, they wouldn&#x27;t do a thing. Besides the bangs and the long shipping, it&#x27;s a nice, long wig. It&#x27;s also very easy to untangle.&lt;br /&gt;  ~Ginger</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations, but it was good enough that I had no complaints. The wig&#x27;s fullness was not the best, and many times I had to fix the hair in order to hide lumps or other imperfections such as seeing the base of the wig. After only the second time I wore it, the wig was getting terribly knotted and it was a bother to fix. Though, it wasn&#x27;t all bad. The hair looks very realistic, but not to the touch, and gives a very cute look when worn. The bangs are long, which may need to be cut depending on who you are, and they cover as much of the base of the wig as possible. The style is very simple, so many people thought it was actually my hair. All in all, this products deserves its four-star rating, and is a very quality purchase.</li>
    <li> It have&#x27;t worn this out yet, but as far as trying it on, it&#x27;s okay. The hair is super fine and soft, but it is heat resistant -with my flat iron on the lowest sitting-. It&#x27;s not a very full wig either, but that&#x27;s fine. Unfortunately it does tangle, which seems to be the thing with either curly or long straight wigs, but my loop brush takes care of that okay. It doesn&#x27;t shed badly, and I&#x27;m looking forward to wearing it out, not on a windy day though.</li>
    <li> This wig feels so real and is a good price!  You can&#x27;t beat it for the money and I love the length.</li>
    <li> Nice wig. Luxurious. Very long. Bangs are too long. Need to be cut. Gets tangled but that&#x27;s expected. Well buy again.</li>
    <li> For the money, this wig is amazing.  I somehow didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from China however.  Needed it for Halloween and had it for Thanksgiving but that&#x27;s probably my fault for not reading delivery dates carefully.  It actually arrived before the estimated delivery.</li>
    <li> It looked great the best option however is that you braid your hair down and try and put on a wig cap that way it will lay down a lot better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a cosplay wig, and it&#x27;s actually much better quality than I was expecting for the price. It&#x27;s not as brushable as, say, an Arda wig, but much lighter and more realistic. Plus I didn&#x27;t have to sew it to the right size; it was just right for my head.</li>
    <li> THIS WIG CAME 2 WEEKS EARLY!!!!! I was pleasantly surprised, I have had this wig for bout six months now, wearing it everyday but only 5 days a week for about 8-10 hours a day. This wig is great and has done the one thing I wanted it to do; change my look and give something versitale to work with(you can curl it,braid it, bun it, and more!), I wasn&#x27;t aiming for a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look and very few people could tell it was a wig (even on its raggity and tangled days) I do have a few complaints about this wig though. First of it&#x27;s rather small. The cap will not cover your entire head and this causes it to be very loose fitting (the adjustable straps don&#x27;t work) if you don&#x27;t pin it to your wig cap it will be able to fall off VERY easily. Second the hair is very thin, this poses no problem when you wear it down but it really does when you wanna do something new for example if I ever tried to do a half updo my edges and half of my head would be exposed and that was very dissapointing. (Although if you pin the bangs to that side it&#x27;s covered) Other than that the wig was great! It did lose it&#x27;s soft shine and tangle and fray but all wigs do and it looked great in side braids !overall I got more than what I paid for and this wig did me good but I only recommend it if you don&#x27;t have 20$ to buy a high quality wig or you don&#x27;t mind the \\&quot;wiginess\\&quot; that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Despite being fake fibers, the wig looks real and feels real as well. It tangles a bit easily but its easy to mange and style.</li>
    <li> This wig is pretty ok. Not quite what I expected but it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
    <li> I will admitt, the product came not even a week later. However...the quality is poor. Great for kids play. not Adult play...came with a wig cap though....Meh</li>
    <li> A good, high quality wig for the price. I have bought much more expensive wigs that weren&#x27;t as high quality. Kanekalon is a great synthetic wig fiber, and typically is much more expensive. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was the long wait for shipping. I probably shouldn&#x27;t gripe, seeing as it was free, but it did take a little over a month to get to me. Overall a very nice quality wig. Would definitely recommend for cosplay! It looks and feels real, not too shiny or brittle.</li>
    <li> 5 stars because this wig is soft, silky and very long. I&#x27;m 4&#x27;11 so it goes down to my butt. It looks very natural and cute. Not itchy and had perfect straps! Very very minimal shedding. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The wig came in almost a week before it was expected!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;the side bangs are a bit long, but its always easy to trim a little.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an okay quality for the price!&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself was a little bit thinner than I was expecting, but then I realized that I liked it better thinner because I have a thick long wig that was hot and kind of heavy and got on my nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tangle, as do all long wigs, so that&#x27;s not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning on using this for multiple cosplay costumes haha~&lt;br /&gt;I really like it and would definitely buy another wig from them in the future!</li>
    <li> Tangles very easily, doesnt last long. Its itchy and just looks obvious its a wig in the light. . .</li>
    <li> Im in love with this wig. I wear it every single day and the bangs on them are so perfect. I may have to buy another one so I can keep my look fresh(:</li>
    <li> This is great. I was really skeptical about buying this as I am with all cheap wigs online but I&#x27;m really happy. It looks really nice and is super soft and looks so real on me. It just needs a bit of styling but it&#x27;s is perfect and good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this wig, it was perfect for my costume. Looked very natural too. It is not very full but for the price it is perfect!</li>
    <li> absolutely gorgeous wig! it is incredibly soft and durable, and comes 100% tangle-free. :) would buy again!</li>
    <li> It was everything that I expected it to be and it came in a timely fashion.  I enjoy wearing Cool2Day Hair, especially after getting many compliments.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t no why I even bothered with this rite after u put it on it tangles. Rite up its annoying and I already have to cut it</li>
    <li> This wig is really great for the price. Outstanding. Eight bucks usually can&#x27;t even buy you a cheap Halloween wig, let alone a decent quality, realistic looking one! The hair is a bit thin, yes, and it tangles easily, but it actually looks quite real and is very comfortable. You just gotta mess with the bangs a bit to get them to look right, but overall I am very satisfied and didn&#x27;t expect anything near this quality for such a low price. I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear it out as an every day wig, but for casual events/photoshoots/etc, this works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this wig for many different characters. The bangs come at a stationary side bang, but i may cut them into regular bangs. No idea yet though.</li>
    <li> A very thick high quality wig. Perfect for cosplay and regular use.&lt;br /&gt;strongly recommend it for all uses and styles.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy , it&#x27;s fake, it doesn&#x27;t stay on your head it also sheds &amp; pieces of hair comes out .</li>
    <li> I brushed it with my fingers and a few chunks of hair fell off :( its kinda shiny but you could use baby powder to hide it. Another thing was that it got to my house a whole month after I bought it but that&#x27;s ok since I didn&#x27;t need it in a rush. Other than that, it looks pretty real~ and its soft too~ so I think it&#x27;s good for its price.</li>
    <li> Love the hair but tangles rly bad......gotra keep it greased</li>
    <li> The wig was in poor condition when I received it and I have never been able to get it to work. The cap was too small and didn&#x27;t hug right.</li>
    <li> It definitely sheds but i still like it. it fits nicely and is easy to work with</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for Tifa Lockhart cosplay, but unfortunately it won&#x27;t&#x27; work for that... hell it won&#x27;t work for anything! It&#x27;s not long enough for Tifa it&#x27;s all different lengths, uneven, hard to style or even brush (even with a proper wig brush) and it has crimps all through it, which really make me hate it. I gave up, and will be looking for a different wig for my needs. Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s thin, shoddily made, and will just frustrate you :(</li>
    <li> Good for the price.wigs like this that are fully synthetic just aren&#x27;t made to last.dont expect perfect quality if you don&#x27;t want to pay that price.yhis is a good wig if you aren&#x27;t planning on wearing it literally every day.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice wig. It looks great, the feel is so so smooth. Very nice for cosplay! its very thick too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, its rather heavy, also it TANGLES IF YOU JUST TOUCH IT THE WRONG WAY. It will require a lot of care or it will fray badly.&lt;br /&gt;All the same, I would recommend it for any cosplayer. I used it for both Ling Yao from FMA (looks great in a ponytail, snarls something awful though), and for Leah of Hel.</li>
    <li> Love it super cute and while a little shiny its easy to get rid of. Otherwise super cute wig totally natural</li>
    <li> This is the only wig I own. I bought it to imagine what I would look like with black hair. Surprise bonus... my boyfriend is super into it, too. It feels like real hair, although smoother and thicker than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a wig cap. Even as a novice, I found it easy to put on and style. The bangs are awkwardly long, but I plan to cut them to fit my face.</li>
    <li> although it&#x27;s a little bit shiny it feels really soft. i was surprised it was a fiber wig, but i like how it looks, it gives me the appearance i just went to the beauty salon. i really love it, i think i am gonna go outside and wear it. thanks.</li>
    <li> Quality is awful. Wig tangles. Even for synthetic hair it should not have been as cheaply constructed. Should have returned</li>
    <li> Great material, very smooth and easy to style. It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice wig for the price.  The hair feels very soft and it&#x27;s very shiny.  The only thing that I do not care for is that the bangs are very long.  You can fix that though by pinning it back or cutting the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig to use for a costume, and it ended up being a great choice.  I had to trim the wig a bit to get it to the length I wanted to, as I wanted it to be a bit shorter than pictured, and the styling and cutting was a snap, which I was happy about.  The wig is a little thinner than I expected, which was okay, but it doesn&#x27;t have any parts where the netting is exposed, so it didn&#x27;t create any problems.  The wig fibers feel a little plasticky but style well, and they don&#x27;t look shiny in photos.  This wig would be a good choice if you&#x27;re not looking for a lot of body in the wig!</li>
    <li> Severe electrostatic effect. Tangled as soon as your pick then up.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t like this wig, it might be great for a costume wig but that&#x27;s about it. The wig cap doesn&#x27;t fit, and the actual make of the wig is off from the pictures to me.</li>
    <li> Very diss appointed all was a waste of money and time such that other people complain my face was looking different</li>
    <li> So the expected arrival date for this was actually in mid-February, and I got it on New Year&#x27;s eve!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself is just like in the picture. It&#x27;s really long, really soft, and looks super natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Until you get some natural sunlight on it :/ then it&#x27;s very obvious that it is a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing about it is it sheds a teeny but and smells horrible! I think it&#x27;s the skin top doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bangs are too long for me, but that can be fixed with styling/cutting, not that I&#x27;d dare do it myself.</li>
    <li> Received the wig on time so the shipping is really fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is very smooth and thin. My only problem is that it sheds REALLY easily! I only glided my hand through the wig a few times and many of the strands of hair fell out. Also compare to my other wigs, this one is probably the most uncomfortable to wear because the cap size was too small and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for only $20 it is a very decent quality wig and looks very natural. You do get what you pay for so if you&#x27;re looking for a more higher quality and longer lasting wig I would not recommend this one.</li>
    <li> The wig is very smooth and brushes out well! The bangs have a lot of hair and will most likely be trimmed. The netting does not show in the wig and the length feels natural. The shine looks natural and the wig fits nicely. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig. However it does look just like a wig. Nit really natural. Very long,  don&#x27;t have option for length. Density is low. Thin. But cute.</li>
    <li> Too shines... doesn&#x27;t look real</li>
    <li> If not, I must have a big head because it does not fit. Besides that the quality is very low. Pieces of hair started to fall out as soon as I got it out of the packaging. My friend told me to return it, but I just didn&#x27;t have the time so for 7 dollars I threw it out. It&#x27;s really not worth it. Perhaps this would be alright for a child, but I would be wary of buying this wig because it is very small and would not stay on my head.</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this wig! The quality is amazing, and the style is really great! Totally a great wig for cosplayers like me!</li>
    <li> After it arrived we are happy with the purchase however the company continues to call which has now become annoying. If you are stating you are refunding me $2 US dollars, just do it and stop calling.</li>
    <li> Came pretty tangled but worth it for the price. A little brushing and its perfect.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping - it came a full week before the estimate&lt;br /&gt;Good material - it won&#x27;t pass for real hair, but it&#x27;s higher in quality than, for example, your typical costume wig&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Tangles constantly. Be prepared to spend quite a bit of time brushing it out. I&#x27;m going to try conditioning it to help, but out of the bag, it tangles with the slightest movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I let conditioner sit in the wig for a few minutes before rinsing it and let it dry overnight. It made a huge difference - it was much easier to comb out and laid a bit more naturally. However it does seem as if I&#x27;ll have to do it multiple times as the effect wore off throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap wig, but it&#x27;s full coverage, comes not tangled, looks normal, and is fine. I didn&#x27;t end up using it for what I got it for because it is so long!</li>
    <li> I just got it on friday, and I love it. It is soft, and it looks just like the picture. My only problem is that it tangles really easily. I was sceptical about people saying that it tangled, but it is actually true. I am constantly brushing it. But oh well, it still is very nice.</li>
    <li> WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT TAKE CARE OF YOUR WIGS IT WILL FRAY. But that is not the wigs fault, It&#x27;s yours. I learned this the hard way. Mine is currently frayed baddd. But that was my fault for a first time wig owner. I cut it with a straight razor. And didn&#x27;t use a wig brush. But this wig is very amazing. Looks real enough to wear every day. Fits well. And is over all amazing. WILL BUY AGAIN! :)</li>
    <li> I got this hair and I had to wait 2 months to get it and there is no tracking it that&#x27;s the down fualt of this I am not happy with that the hair is really long  you have to cut it  I like the hair but shipping it just too long to wait for it to come</li>
    <li> We bought this for a Halloween custom for my husband, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much. But boy does it stink. It smells like it was dipped in a vat of trumpet valve oil. And yes, that is a wildly specific statement, but take my word for it. And it looks like it is super oily also. I tried to wash it, so we will see, but it is for one night, so I am not that upset over it. I am just glad I am not wearing it.</li>
    <li> There is no way any positive reviews on here can be real. Received my wig today and it is garbage. But check this out, my expectations was not even that high and it still did not meet that. This wig is a tangled mess.</li>
    <li> This wig is very well done. It also looks very very natural, like the real hair.</li>
    <li> it looks like a costume wig.....it sheds a lot...and the hair looks soo fake..so disappointed....wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone....I&#x27;ll put this on my two year old for Halloween this year</li>
    <li> This wig is really pretty and soft, and it looks so natural that people didn&#x27;t believe me when I said it was a wig until they inspected the top of it thoroughly. lol. I bought this because I wanted to prove to my mom I look good with black hair and she didn&#x27;t believe me until I finally wore this. I am very happy I bought this since I always wanted this color hair :) the only problem was the cap was a little too small but it worked out okay so I&#x27;m overall very happy ^^</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got it in the mail today! then I tried it on nd was loving it, then it went down hill! Great price and all but it gets too tangly , thanks :)</li>
    <li> This was the first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but overall I thought the wig was very nice. It has good thickness and didn&#x27;t shed at all. It was a bit longer than I had expected it to be but that wasn&#x27;t very much of a problem and didn&#x27;t change the quality of the wig overall.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t tangle immediately but after some time it became very tangled. If you buy this wig, expect to brush constantly if you&#x27;re going to be wearing it a lot.</li>
    <li> I really got what i was hoping for :D The length was great and great quality. Highly recomended for all people</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for my niece to go with a costume she is wearing to a party,and she says auntie it is better than what she needed and I agree.The wig is just beautiful..Now she wants some more.Great product.</li>
    <li> I love trying on wigs, but I don&#x27;t get the chance and normally you find only bad and horribly styled wigs for the price I got this wig. I Love wearing it, friends have commented on how real it looks, both in picture and in person! :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy more wings like this one when I want another.</li>
    <li> The hair is good quality and easy to care for, but the wig-cap is a little small. It fits securely and enhances the costume experience.</li>
    <li> Luv it thank u its really cool I got it for  really gud deal to I will always get my  stuff from here</li>
    <li> For the price is a decent wig. Better than a Halloween store, but by far my least nice wig. It&#x27;s rats easily, it&#x27;s not as soft as my others, but it worked for my costume and I&#x27;ve worn it a couple other times.</li>
    <li> I recieved the wig WAY sooner than expected! When I wore it, I was estatic (and still are!). It&#x27;s so realistic and gorgeous. What I didn&#x27;t realize was that that it came with two gifts, a fishnet cap and socks. I&#x27;m so thankful for those! Lol. Also, in my e-mail box the Sellers were super helpful and nice. I wish I could give it more than just five stars.</li>
    <li> Used this for a &amp;#34;Marceline, the Vampire Queen&amp;#34; costume for a child. As this is an adult size, the wig itself needed to be pinned to real hair to keep it in place, but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing great, nothing terrible about this item, so 3 stars.</li>
    <li> NOTHING like the photo ........ very very very fake and the material is so &amp;#34; plastic &amp;#34; looking ...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s far from the worst</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this wig for a yeat now and absolutely love the hair. You really get your money worth!</li>
    <li> The material and quality was a lot better than I expected so I&#x27;m very happy! Of course,it doesn&#x27;t look very very realistic to where I&#x27;d feel comfortable wearing it without a hat, but it&#x27;s awesome for fun and costumes!</li>
    <li> When I received this, I immediately put it on. The bangs were cut choppily, REALLY choppily. I had to re-trim them myself even to wear them as side bangs. Straight bangs with this wig is completely out of the question. It looks like a blind person cut them. Other than the horrible bangs, the wig is pretty thick and stood up well for an entire weekend of wear with no brushing.</li>
    <li> I brushed it the same day I got it and had most of the hair in my brush, Horrible shedding</li>
    <li> Okay so if your looking for a natural wig I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one. It&#x27;s very thick and shiny. I got a lot of tangling but I&#x27;m going to see if a wash and detangler will help. It&#x27;s very soft and thinner at the top so you might be able to see the wig construction. I put a beret on and it covers that so hats a must with this. I braided the wig to the front and it looks very cute and natural. Definitely requires styling and the bangs are hard to work with. Will post a picture.</li>
    <li> the other reviews don&#x27;t seem as bad, so maybe it was just the wig i got, but it was tangled and matted  the hair is so frizzy and just looks like an insane mess! ive gotten many wigs that were very cheap, and those were not this bad!</li>
    <li> The wig, and a wig stand I bought from the same seller, ship all the way from Asia, and took about six weeks before it ended up in my mailbox. The wig had a bit of a rat&#x27;s nest in the back, but I&#x27;m sure with some conditioning and plenty of gentle brushing, I can get it out. Over all, it&#x27;s a nice length, and the fibers feel nice and soft and look shiny like natural, healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this was a pretty sweet buy.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not super quality, but it IS really adorable and well-made for the price. Sometimes the hair falls out when I&#x27;m brushing it, though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for a couple of uses and it looks great (if a little shiny), but it DOES tangle easily and it DOES shed easily.</li>
    <li> I Got It Early. So Happy its prettty long it sheds alot it tangles alot to it looks natural they bangs are long also . I Didnt Put any heatt to the whole thing but i did to the bangs. its perfect. Ive been working with wigs alot so it a good wig but they shedding is my only problem.</li>
    <li> This wig was actually longer than I expected but was still nice, it came with a wig cap and a beautiful box with a ribbon attached to it! I had decided to get a refund no longer wanting the wig just because I had second thoughts about it (seller was super responsible about it) but after actually receiving it, I fell in love with it! Thank you for the great wig for a great price!</li>
    <li> I was actually very please with this wig! I am always hesitant with getting wigs from sellers i&#x27;ve never heard of before, but this wig is perfect for the costume i need it for and i am VERY satisfied.</li>
    <li> Too shiny, and don&#x27;t understand how this product could remain on the market, especially here on amazon.com considering their good reputation?!? Whatever CHEAP product they made this wig with Tangles on it&#x27;s own, tangles by the touch of a hand, tangles WHILE you&#x27;re brushing it, and even tangles when the wind blows?!? Ridiculous!  If I wasn&#x27;t out of the country, I&#x27;d take the time to return it.  Take my advice and pass this one!</li>
    <li> The color was black and the hair is silky and str8 i really love the length to.  I was very pleased with the product it was also similar to the picture.</li>
    <li> This is the first wig I have ever purchased. I work in a hair salon and I love changing my look but my hair is currently too short for extensions so I decided on going for a wig. I chose this one mainly because of the cute pictures and low prices. After much debating I decided to purchase this specific wig and figured if I didn&#x27;t like it I didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I love it. It fits nicely on my head and looks pretty natural. It is a bit shiny but for a wig that is not made up of human hair and for the price you pay it definitely met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Loved it, just got it late. But there&#x27;s always next year.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised when I got this in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;I have never worn wigs and was a little apprehensive about it but for the price I thought what the heck I&#x27;ll try it out&lt;br /&gt;It is super soft and shiny but not so much that it seems fake or artificial I was really happy to see that it also doesn&#x27;t look fake when you&#x27;re wearing it. I haven&#x27;t had anyone say anything bad about it and my friends say it looks really normal, they can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was too! My only wish would be that it was a bit thicker, but other than that I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> tangled way too easily. First time i tried it on and it was tangled instantly. Now it is just a mock wig. Friends like to call it the Lil Jon wig because that&#x27;s how it looks now :/</li>
    <li> The second I pulled it out of the box, it got incredibly tangled. For the price I paid, I&#x27;ve bought better quality wigs. The texture is terrible and the ends were tangled together and frizzy. No matter how hard I tried to fix it, it only got worse. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice long straight black wig, you might as well put the money in it and buy a wig from a more qualified store. Definitely would not recommend</li>
    <li> Rather poorly put together and runs smaller than similar wigs that I&#x27;ve had. Tangles easily and hair falls out. You definitely pay for what you get.</li>
    <li> The wig is horrible I just got the wig and I am very disappointed in the tangled shiny synthetic mess. Never again</li>
    <li> very nice wig. very soft and very long. cute for any costume. It did take some time to ship, i will remember to order more ahead of time</li>
    <li> I guess for the prize I paid it was okay. It got all tangly by the third day and the hairs keep coming off! It&#x27;s kind of hard to style too. The length was too long but I guess I can always cut it or something.</li>
    <li> My daughter has blonde scraggly hair and when she put on this wig for her presentation at Denver Jewish Day School, she really knocked &#x27;em dead!! She looked just like Frida Kahlo!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this wig and I wear it alot, especially when I&#x27;m having bad hair days or waiting on my salon appointmemts. It isn&#x27;t as black as it says it is, more of an off black color that leans to a dark brown. Thats the only flaw I have, but it do get tangled alot, but it just needs a good brushing and oiling. Overall I personally like it and think about it, for the price? You can&#x27;t beat that. Also it came earlier then the shipment date so thats always a big plus.</li>
    <li> Got this when it was on sale and figurered it would be pretty mediocre. I was wrong, this wig is so pretty. This is my first wig and I couldnt be happier. The bangs are really long so I did have to trim them. Love it!!</li>
    <li> we had a hard time keeping it on</li>
    <li> The hair quality is not as good as i expected</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy ewww! Such a ugly wig, tangles really quick! The first day I opened it the wig strap ripped &amp; tangled a lot , the bangs are all tangled,&amp; look nothing like they do in the picture. I wish I could rate it 0! Waste of money! Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> This is a child&#x27;s wig. Wish I would have know before I bought it.</li>
    <li> It frizzes up really easily, and the cap is a little tight. It&#x27;s black, not dark brown as it seemed in the pictures, which was excellent! Recommend this? Maybe. It&#x27;s good to work with if you cut it or know how to style it and such.</li>
    <li> I do professional costuming, so quality is super important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is *perfect.* It&#x27;s the best wig I&#x27;ve bought, hands down. It&#x27;s silky smooth, doesn&#x27;t tangle and is super thick. Not a single person could tell that it wasn&#x27;t my real hair-- and they also included a wig cap!</li>
    <li> This just does not suit me.</li>
    <li> the product was not what i expected it sheds the same day i got it and its thin so that mean theres barely any hair left on the wig.&lt;br /&gt;please do better</li>
    <li> I had read some reviews before I got this project, so I was not too concerned about how long it took to ship. It&#x27;s also coming from China, so although it took a while, the delay was understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several wigs of a more unnatural variety- bright blue and green. This was my first natural looking wig and I was unsure of what to expect because the price seemed too cheap to produce anything very natural looking. However, after receiving the product in the mail and trying it on, I was extremely pleased with how natural it looked. It was a bit longer than I expected, though that may just be because I am short. Overall, I am very happy with how this turned out, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WIG. It&#x27;s amazing, and was EXACTLY what I was looking for! Gorgeous wig that came so much faster than I thought it would, and I&#x27;m so pleased with it. I will most defiantly be ordering from this seller again. XD</li>
    <li> The wig is good quality, even though it&#x27;s not real hair, and looks amazing. The sizing is adjustable and it was easy to trim to the length I wanted it. Amazing deal-- the best deal I&#x27;ve found for a black wig on Amazon-- many other, shorter wigs are much more expensive. I had to wait a while for it, but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t be happier with this wig! its absolutely beautiful, soooooo soft, looks better than my 50 dollar wigs feels amazing on , though it does shed but a good wash should take care of that, will most certainly be ordering more wigs from these guys even is it takes forever to ship from china, it is super long longer than it looks on the girl in the pics but thats what i wanted. LOVE LOVE LOVE this wig!</li>
    <li> very long very real looking, very cute, though i trimmed mine up... bad part is it is synthetic.... oh well looks good none the less</li>
    <li> Great for the price, I was truly surprised at the quality.  It was a teeny bit large, but I was able to adjust and work with it fairly easily.  It looks nice and thick, not think and stringy like some I&#x27;ve seen.  It does tangle pretty badly, though, the only downside.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to a &amp;#34;bad hair cut&amp;#34; and needed something cheap until it grows out some. This looked like my real hair pretty much and the quality is great! I suggest wearing a hat over it for an even more natural look, no one can tell the difference. The only thing I took away a star for is the fact it does seem to shed a bit, but for the price, you would expect that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but does look fake, with shiny shiny strands. It stays on good, and is easy to take care of.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made well I can brush it and hair doesn&#x27;t fall out. The length is nice too but it is really shiny. I have washed it to try to get rid of some of shine but it didn&#x27;t help much. Over all it&#x27;s a nice wig but you can&#x27;t make someone think  it&#x27;s your real hair.</li>
    <li> This wig tangled to easily to be worn a lot. But it worked well for a costume. I trimmed the wig with hair scissors to get it the length I needed. I would not get this wig to wear every day, but it is great for a costume!</li>
    <li> Got my wig maybe 2 weeks ago and although it was very soft, straight, and silky I just couldn&#x27;t get it to look right on me. It definitely had that  \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot; look. It&#x27;s a cute wig, just not on me. Oh and it does TANGLE TANGLE TANGLE! So you might wanna have a paddle brush handy but other than that put a cute floppy hat on like I did and your good to go.</li>
    <li> I am very dissapointed to say that I have no idea where this wig is at. It was supposed to be here 2 days ago and is not. I think 2 months is plenty of time to get this here. Very dissapointed in Cool2day.</li>
    <li> The wig quality was so awful and hair was constantly falling off in chunks. The only way id wear this is if I were attending a halloween party in a cheap costume. I had to throw it away after only using twice. Pretty disappointing in this wig!</li>
    <li> I love this wig, it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve gotten from this seller&lt;br /&gt;All their wigs are great,I have many but this one is my all time favorite&lt;br /&gt;It came early and looks so natural. I just bought another one.</li>
    <li> Was cutter when I cut it shorter other wise doesn&#x27;t look natural or feel natural.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a basic, sexy, long,straight wig with a bang, this is the one for you. This wig is very sexy. It has beautiful bangs that you can either wear in the front, or swoop them to whichever side you feel most comfortable with.This wig comes with adjustable straps. It fits pretty snug on your head. I love the length. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7 and it comes down to my lower back. I have already purchased a lot of these wigs.  If I ever feel the need to purchase more, I will.</li>
    <li> Its soft, but its extremely shiny, a bit plasticy and the bangs must constantly be fixed in the right position. It also gets tangled easily. I was able to get some good pictures with it on, but in person, it looks different and it doesnt look natural.</li>
    <li> purchased for my daughter to wear at cosplay in miami.  she is pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a Halloween Costume (Jade from Mortal Kombat) and I couldn&#x27;t wear it because I couldn&#x27;t get the bangs and side part to cooperate.  The super long bangs just wanted to stay in my eyes and covering my face unless I pinned it back.  Also, the part wasn&#x27;t smooth it was awkward so I just abandoned the wig altogether.  I assume wigs aren&#x27;t something you can return, so I didn&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the hair did feel pretty good and could be brushed out.  Wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad if I could get the part to line up and stay smooth down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry. The reviews are misleading. This wig is terrible. It sheds. It tangles like no other wig I&#x27;ve ever seen or worked with  (I&#x27;m a performing artist) and forget about brushing it or even run your fingers thru the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used it once and it&#x27;s already half the thickness it was. It was thin to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY dissappinted. No wonder the price dropped. What a waste of money :/</li>
    <li> I bought this wig and was really excited for it, but I ended up throwing it in the garbage 3 days after it arrived. It claims this wig is made out of kanekalon, but I have another wig that I spent a very large amount of money on that is also kanekalon and it has never had any of the problems that this one did. Kanekalon is a very high quality Japanese synthetic fiber and whatever this is made out of is not it. It became so tangled and knotted that I trashed it after washing it properly and brushing it for over 3 hours with no luck of getting a single knot out. It became unwearable after just 3 days. I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
