      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>this is a phenomenal product.  </li>
      <li>packs a punch and have shown to be the best ingredients when used regularly.</li>
      <li>The two most potent peptides, Argireline and Matrixyl 3000 are not in this.</li>
      <li>(a tactic used by many companies selling Vitamin C products).      </li>
      <li>It gives you visible improvments and a lovely glow.</li>

      <li>(a tactic used by many companies selling Vitamin C products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line:  </li>
      <li>I adore Wheat Germ Oil, as it is very rich in both Lecithin and Vitamin E.</li>
      <li>Improved texture/feel of the skin and diminished fine lines.</li>
      <li>Jojoba Oil is fabulous.</li>
      <li>They can create a smooth surface but have no anti-aging properties.</li>
      <li>I bought it from Amazon when I discovered they were selling at a significant discount.  </li>
      <li>You also don&#x27;t have to pay full price for it.</li>
      <li>Could it be true?</li>
      <li>When used consistently this product reduced the fine wrinkles in my face.</li>
      <li>What I am most suprised about is the fact that the three most proven ingredients in the skin care arena are not present in this \\&quot;miracle product.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>While it can give your skin a healthy glow and help to fight against free radical damage, studies have shown this to be much more effective when it is taken internally as a pill, as opposed to topical application.</li>
      <li>What I am most suprised about is the fact that the three most proven ingredients in the skin care arena are not present in this \\&quot;miracle product.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>This can cause cancer, and became something people became more aware of a couple years back when it was found in many baby products.</li>
      <li>It really does feel (and look) like a mini facelift!!  </li>
      <li>It is highly nourishing, yet it is light and absorbs right into the skin.</li>
      <li>This was the \\&quot;latest\\&quot; and greatest skin care miracle a few years back.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Tribehenin: This simply helps the product penetrate more easilyinto the skin and is a mixture of behenic acid &amp; glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will most likely be purchasing this again for her when she runs out.</li>
      <li>They are frequently used, though, because they feel nice on the skin and people are more likely to regularly use the product based on that alone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most people think when i&#x27;m walking with my 25 year old son and my 5 year old grandson...</li>
      <li>You may be more familiar with the first ingredient, as it is the key ingredient in dry oil sprays.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing these barrier agents do in terms of anti-aging.</li>
      <li>this product really works well and it made my skin super soft.</li>
      <li>This product change my opinion about skin treatment, my skin is soft fresh and with lest wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Since I can get 2 whole face treatments per capsule, this works out well for my budget.    </li>
      <li>really, really works on wrinkles</li>
      <li>and she really like the price of it.</li>
      <li>Red hair average fair skin.</li>
      <li>This a a highly nourishing oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, some do present side effects in certain individuals with certain health issues and medications.</li>
      <li>: This is plant-derived, to add a slight orange scent to the product, most likely so customers using it will smell the orange and falsely believe that it is so packed with vitamin C that it is doing something good for the skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;Citrus Bark Extract: This is plant-derived, to add a slight orange scent to the product, most likely so customers using it will smell the orange and falsely believe that it is so packed with vitamin C that it is doing something good for the skin</li>
      <li>You will probably run a greater risk of cancer from excessive diet soda or living in the city.    </li>
      <li>If you are realistic and not expecting major changes you will like Tripetinon capsules.</li>
      <li>that i&#x27;m the wife or mama of the 5 year old.  </li>
      <li>When they learn that the 25 year old is my son...</li>
      <li>I was looking for \\&quot;some improvement\\&quot; and did not expect dermatologist/skin peel or professional quality improvement.</li>
      <li>Safflower can be used well by nearly everyone.</li>
      <li>Keeps me looking young.  </li>
      <li>I have been using tripep \\&quot;face-lift\\&quot; capsules at night faithfully for 2-3 years now (along with Olay complete).</li>
      <li>In other words, 4 extra molecules have been added to the original Vitamin C molecule.</li>
      <li>When you put it on at first it feels oily but it sinks in within minutes.</li>
      <li>I have gluten and lactose intolerance with strong reaction on chemicals and have hard time to find a product for my skin.</li>
      <li>I live in California and am outside quite a bit riding horses.    </li>
      <li>The newly designed capsules create a mess on both hands because upon removing the &#x27;top&#x27; the product oozes onto both of your hands.  </li>
      <li>I will probably have to seek a dermatologist to do major improvements if I want to look like a 35-year-old again.</li>
      <li>I use daily Olay complete moisturizer with spf 15.</li>
      <li>I am a 46 year old female.</li>
      <li>It is a potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic, but can also be irritating to some skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a good product for the price (don&#x27;t pay $70, that&#x27;s silly!).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product, i think it makes my skin better. when i apply it, my skin absorbs it quickly.thanks</li>
    <li> this is a phenomenal product.  Works wonderfully.  This is my second order of it.  I&#x27;m disappointed that the capsules have been slightly redesigned.  My initial shipment&#x27;s capsule design was simple and worked with a slight twist of the wrist.  The newly designed capsules create a mess on both hands because upon removing the &#x27;top&#x27; the product oozes onto both of your hands.  Please change it back.</li>
    <li> I have a bad case of rosacea and I love tripeptinon.</li>
    <li> I see a difference when using this consistantly.</li>
    <li> I am 59.My skin is in very good shape for my age. Wish I could say that about the rest of me. I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin,so I was delighted to discover this product. The instructions indicate that it is a night product,but I have dry Irish skin so I use it in the morning. When you put it on at first it feels oily but it sinks in within minutes.My skin craves it. It feels so lucious.Spend the money and buy it. You will be glad you did. Especially if you are over 40.</li>
    <li> I have tried many skin smoothing products and this is my favorite. It does not sting the eyes and leaves a very smooth feeling to the face and neck in the morning.</li>
    <li> My skin look great with this product, at 60, and I&#x27;ve always taken care of my skin.  You also don&#x27;t have to pay full price for it.</li>
    <li> The advertisement indicated the jar would contain 40 capsules, there were only 31 capsules in the jar.  Very misleading and disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great product, I love it. I have gluten and lactose intolerance with strong reaction on chemicals and have hard time to find a product for my skin. This product change my opinion about skin treatment, my skin is soft fresh and with lest wrinkles. I purchase several already and give as birthday gift to my friends.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product keeps popping up on MSN by way of annoying pop-ups to proclaim that this is the holy grail anti-aging product of the millenium. Could it be true? All one needs to do is thoroughly evaluate the ingredients to see it is not worth $79.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the two most abundant ingredients in this \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product: Cyclimethicone and Dimethiconol. These are silicones. You may be more familiar with the first ingredient, as it is the key ingredient in dry oil sprays.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing these barrier agents do in terms of anti-aging. They can create a smooth surface but have no anti-aging properties. They are frequently used, though, because they feel nice on the skin and people are more likely to regularly use the product based on that alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caprylic/Capric Trigylcerides is simply another term for Fractionated Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simmondsia Chinesis is the name for Jojoba Oil. Jojoba Oil is fabulous. I love the fact that this is so close to our own sebum and it is waxy is just truly wonderful for nearly everyone. Will the use of Jojoba Oil warrant an almost $80 price tag and create \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; results? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ceramide Complex 2: These are lipids and will help plump the skin. There are different forms. For example, the company that revolutionized the ceramide capsule idea years ago, Elizabeth Arden, uses Ceramide 1, 3 and 6 in their capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ubiquinone: This is another name for the compound found in all living cells called Co-Enzyme Q10. This was the \\&quot;latest\\&quot; and greatest skin care miracle a few years back. While it can give your skin a healthy glow and help to fight against free radical damage, studies have shown this to be much more effective when it is taken internally as a pill, as opposed to topical application. I am not saying this isn&#x27;t a good ingredient: it is good for your health, but it will not produce \\&quot;face lifting\\&quot; or miracle results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amino Multi-tides: This is very vague. The company will not disclose WHAT these amino acids are. Their amino multi-tides are supposedly the company&#x27;s blend of amino acids. There are 20 standard amino acids. While amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, some do present side effects in certain individuals with certain health issues and medications. By being so vague, I wouldn&#x27;t try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate: This is Vitamin C-ester. In other words, 4 extra molecules have been added to the original Vitamin C molecule. Vitamin C is wonderful for the skin--in appropriate concentrations. This is not going to lift, tone and tighten the skin, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEG10 Rapeseed Sterol: I would absolutely not use this product based on this alone. PEG is used to thicken products, however, it has repeatedly been shown to be contaminated with something called 1,4-dioxane. This can cause cancer, and became something people became more aware of a couple years back when it was found in many baby products. Research shows that 1,4-dioxane does penetrate the skin, and since it causes cancer, you would obvously not want to touch this one with a 10-foot pole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triticum Vulgare: This is simply Wheat Germ Oil. I adore Wheat Germ Oil, as it is very rich in both Lecithin and Vitamin E. This a a highly nourishing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycyrrhiza Glabra: This is Licorice. Licorice can be effective at calming acne-prone skin, soothing and it when the acne causes discomfort to the skin. It also helps to control the production of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carthamus Tinctorius: This is simply Safflower Oil.Safflower can be used well by nearly everyone. It is highly nourishing, yet it is light and absorbs right into the skin. Some believe it can help maintain the skin&#x27;s structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angelica Archangelica Extract: Comes from the root of the Angelica plant. It is a potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic, but can also be irritating to some skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tribehenin: This simply helps the product penetrate more easilyinto the skin and is a mixture of behenic acid &amp; glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate: This is an emollient and thickening agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Bark Extract: This is plant-derived, to add a slight orange scent to the product, most likely so customers using it will smell the orange and falsely believe that it is so packed with vitamin C that it is doing something good for the skin (a tactic used by many companies selling Vitamin C products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line:  I would never spend $79 on this product. There is nothing in this, based solely on the ingredients list, that will do what it claims. What I am most suprised about is the fact that the three most proven ingredients in the skin care arena are not present in this \\&quot;miracle product.\\&quot; The two most potent peptides, Argireline and Matrixyl 3000 are not in this. Hyaluronic Acid combined with one or both of those 2 ingredients packs a punch and have shown to be the best ingredients when used regularly. To overlook those 3 ingredients--to not even add in ONE--speaks volumes about how unlikely it is that this product will deliver on any of its claims.and thickening agent.

    <li> I gave this a five star rating because I previously used this product and could only purchase with a license. I was so happy to find all their products on Amazon. Very soft and silky feeling, a little greasy but it soaks in after a couple minutes. Its not a miracle worker but I use daily and I am happy with the results. Will definitely buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the BEST products I&#x27;ve ever used!!  It really does feel (and look) like a mini facelift!!  Pair it with AminoGenesis Perfect Reflection and you&#x27;ll have wonderful anti-aging products that really work!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used tripep for a while now. I have decided to start using it again. When I use it my face is like silk .my pores seem to be a bit smaller and if I get it for a good price like the 39 that Is suggested here with free shipping it&#x27;s perfect one dollar per capsule .. Great!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love the way it goes on and my face and it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily at all.  Keeps me looking young.  Most people think when i&#x27;m walking with my 25 year old son and my 5 year old grandson...that i&#x27;m the wife or mama of the 5 year old.  When they learn that the 25 year old is my son...they freak out and don&#x27;t believe me.  I don&#x27;t know if this product is helping me wth that but i&#x27;m not going to stop using this product to test out that theory.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and saw a very big difference in my skin almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I love Amino Genesis products. I have been using the product line for a month and have seen great improvements in my skin.  My skin is brighter and firmer.  I find that there is enough serum in each capsule for 2 applications.  So I have been applying half in the morning and half at night.  I look younger since using this line.</li>
    <li> This product have very nice smell！I hope it will work well on my dryness skin, one bottle can use 40 times.</li>
    <li> I am a 46 year old female. Red hair average fair skin. I tend to burn but will tan. I use daily Olay complete moisturizer with spf 15. For summer sun activity I put on spf 60 and hats. I live in California and am outside quite a bit riding horses.    Several years ago my facial skin started taking a dive in appearance. Liver spots and wrinkles so I researched anti-aging products. I was looking for \\&quot;some improvement\\&quot; and did not expect dermatologist/skin peel or professional quality improvement. I tried a few products including tripeptinon. I stuck with the tripeptinon because I like the feeling of it and it is a good value. I stab the capsule with a needle and get two nights of applications from it. I have been using tripep \\&quot;face-lift\\&quot; capsules at night faithfully for 2-3 years now (along with Olay complete). I do remember when I started using it I had dramatic results in two days. I even took before and after pictures to make sure I was not imagining the changes.    The improvements are subtle, but there. Improved texture/feel of the skin and diminished fine lines. A glow that suggests health. I&#x27;d say it took about 5-7 years off my sun damaged face. Last year when I hit some temporary financial skids I had to stop the \\&quot;extras\\&quot; we enjoyed, and that included tripeptinon. I REALLY saw my face lose it&#x27;s glow and within two months the subtle changes (basically, I looked haggerd) made me a bit desperate to get my tripeptinon back.     I am back and using my Tripep. I found a seller on eBay who sells 40 capsules for under $30 plus $4 to ship it. Since I can get 2 whole face treatments per capsule, this works out well for my budget.    Is is a miracle? No. If you are realistic and not expecting major changes you will like Tripetinon capsules. It gives you visible improvments and a lovely glow. It is a good product for the price (don&#x27;t pay $70, that&#x27;s silly!). My doctor said that this amount of PEG10 Rapeseed Sterol (purified for human use) will not give me cancer so I suggest you look at that other review with a cautious eye. You will probably run a greater risk of cancer from excessive diet soda or living in the city.    In the end, I still look 40. I still have about a dozen liver spots (they faded slightly). I will probably have to seek a dermatologist to do major improvements if I want to look like a 35-year-old again. Considering the amount of sun I have gotten over the years I say my Tripep is doing a damned good job FOR NOW in keeping my face looking appealing. I do get compliments on my appearance so that is testimony enough for me.   You mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> When used consistently this product reduced the fine wrinkles in my face. Very easy to apply...feels great on.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I apply over my moisturizer at night.  Feels great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 52.  Everyone thinks I&#x27;m at least 10 years you get.</li>
    <li> really, really works on wrinkles</li>
    <li> I tried Tripeptinon about two years ago and loved the way it made my skin feel, but I didn&#x27;t love the price.  I bought it from Amazon when I discovered they were selling at a significant discount.  I still love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff  takes years off my face</li>
    <li> this product really works well and it made my skin super soft. i would definately purchase it again. you cant beat the price either.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it. I knew she would like it since she has bought it before. She mentioned it was getting harder to find. I found it on amazon and she really like the price of it. I will most likely be purchasing this again for her when she runs out.</li>
    <li> I have use it for 4 months, i observed that my skin become soft and less wrinkles. I recomended for my friends.</li>
