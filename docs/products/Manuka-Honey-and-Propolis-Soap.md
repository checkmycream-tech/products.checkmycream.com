      <li>Somewhat expensive but makes an excellent lather, smells good and has been great for keeping my face clear of blemishes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This soap combines great sudsing with a wonderful pure honey fragrance. It is so easy to handle in the shower because of the shape and lasts a long time. I love it! I think it is only slightly more expensive than most specialty bar soaps, but the fragrance alone is worth it, especially if you absolutely love honey.</li>
    <li> 1-the bar of soap is pretty big.  2-one side of the bar is honey, the other side is propolis.  3-it doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey, and it smells sorta organicy...like REAL honey.    4-finally, it does what it is supposed to achieve, it works fantastically as an  antiseptic soap, and that is what matters most.    if you want a bar of soap that has a very perfumy smell of honey, but not much antiseptic powers, get another brand....  if you want a good honey based antiseptic natural soap, get this one.</li>
    <li> This soap was just ok..I expected alot more because of all the good reviews it got but was disapointed..This soap left my skin very dry and left white patches on my face and a wierd tight feeling...The only good thing about it was the smell, the packaging, and it lasts for a long time..It didnt really help with my acne like other people said it would but then again everyone is different..overall, i wouldnt purchase this soap again..Do not purchase if you have dry skin because this will make it worst....</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  I have skin rash problems, particularly in winter.  Showering with it helps moisturize my skin and minimize the itching.  Pleasant scent.  Plenty of lather.  Big, almost 5 Oz.  Quick delivery.  Will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I began using this honey soap while deployed to Afhganistan. It is the one product that I found that didn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and yet still offered a deep clean and a solution to the heat spots and chafing that came from wearing the same type of clothing every day for a year in a severe environment. The moisturizing effects did not leave my skin oily. I use the manuka propolis bars exclusively as my body soap now. The smell is wonderful to me, honey with a trace of tea-tree like scent, no artificial scent. As well as being a great cleanser, I found it a comforting product to use while away from home, and still find it so. Shipping is fast, and there is a slight discount for purchasing in bulk. I have always used a separate cleanser for my face, simply because that is my preference. If for some reason I have no facial cleanser on hand, I am still able to use this honey soap on my face with great results.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! I tried it when I had read how good propolis is for your skin and health.  I have bought several bars since and give it to my Mom, who also loves it.  The smell is wonderful.  It does wonders for normal, sensitive, and problem skin.  I use it primarily for my face, but use it all over in the winter.  I hope this product stays around forever!</li>
    <li> I use this soap daily in combination with [[ASIN:B001R7VT7S East Cape New Zealand Manuka Honey Active UMF 20+]] and [[ASIN:B0011DI8K4 Manuka Oil 100% Pure East Cape 10ml/0.34oz]] to treat adult acne (see my other reviews). The hexagon/honeycomb shape of the soap is not only a nice touch in keeping with the honey theme but it actually makes this soap super-easy to grip. Regular bar soaps slip out of my hand constantly in the shower but not this one! It has a pleasantly mild, natural smell. Of course, you&#x27;re not going to spend $8 for one piece of soap no matter how cute the packaging or shape, or how pleasing the scent, or how ergonomic the design. What you are really looking to pay for is a super-high quality, natural antibacterial soap. The fact that this one not only delivers on that but provides all the other fun features as well, is what makes this great soap a real winner. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, not dried out like regular soap. Just one of these bars has lasted six months of daily use (1-2 showers per day) so it&#x27;s a great value. I just bought my second bar and plan on buying this stuff for as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  It feels and smells so wonderful!  And by smells wonderful, it&#x27;s just a soft scent, clean scent..... nothing loud or fruity or anything....I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband and I after reading the reviews...smells good to some people, but if you have any allergies....watch out!!!! it is LOADED with Fragrance and made me sneeze my head off without even unwrapping the product. I returned it and going to try something else as soon as I can get it out of the house..aaaaachhhhoooo!</li>
    <li> I truly love this soap. I have trouble with adult acne and this soap has helped tremendously. I love the large octagonal shaped bars that last a long time. I only use it on my face. I recommend this soap to anyone over 40 with skin issues. Koru Naturals ships very quickly and the bars are packaged very nicely.</li>
    <li> Not for the Manly-Man as the perfume scent is very strong!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap on my face and body for 6 weeks now and I like it. It does not smell like a lot of honey or anything like that but its fine. This soap does not give me the extra dry feeling on my skin as other soap do. I will purchase more of this soap. I do wish the shape was a regular soap shape because it&#x27;s difficult finding a dish that shape (as I still have not).</li>
    <li> I found this soap while looking for anything to treat a horrible staph infection. I was given several antibiotics that made me very ill and did nothing to stop the infectious and painful sores that kept appearing all over my body. I figured I had nothing to lose by trying the manuka/propolis soap. To my utter shock, within a week the sores stopped appearing and the ones I had were healing! Within three weeks they were gone! I have not had an outbreak of the staph sores since. I cannot express the utter hopelessness of having this infection. It takes over your entire world; oozing and painful sores, bandages, prescriptions and medical costs. Then to find this simple little bar of soap and have your life back is a miracle. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough it is slowly healing the scars from the infection, but also old acne scars and other scarring. AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> this soap is really a miracle in a bar, my daughter and I started getting these horrible boils and there didn\\&quot;t seem to be anything to help. My daughter researched to find us some relief and came across the manuka honey items. they are the best I have not had one boil since I started using the soap and the lotion. I can\\&quot;t begin to say enough about this product and besides its benefits for skin problems it also leaves your skin feeling very soft and you never feel dry and itchy, It also has the most pleasant aroma, I look forward to my showers everyday. I have just puchased the shampoo and conditioner I\\&quot;m sure they will be just as good,I\\&quot;ll let you know. Believe me when I say modern day miracle, it was for me. Soap is fantastic and so is the body cream.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to read the ingredients when I received the soap. I assumed it would be more pure.  Had I known about the list, I would not have purchased the soap. Here is the list of ingredients in order from the package: Sodium, Palmitate, Sodium Cocate, Water, Glycerin, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Propolis Extract, Honey, Tetrasodium, EDTA, Pigment Yellow 1, 11680, 2512-29-0,EXT D&amp;C Yellow 5, Food Red 1, 14700, 4548-53-2, FD&amp;C Red #4, Pigment Yellow 42, FEOOH, 77492, 20344-49-4.  I don&#x27;t know what half of these are...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep the soap rather than go through the hassle of returning it. I will say I like the creamy feel of the soap. However, the soap has a very strong smell, for those of you who are sensitive to strong odors.</li>
    <li> This stuff is no doubt an amazing product. I do wonder, however, why the octagon? The hive is constructed based on the Hexagon.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis, and my skin has not felt this good in years. I use it on my face too, and it is wonderful.  I love it so much, I look forward to taking a shower.  I love this soap, it makes my skin feel wonderful.  It is true that it has a strong fragrance.  I am allergic to some smells, and some strong perfumes, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me, actually I like it, although it is strong enough that it would interfere with a perfume.  I have used it in the morning, applied no other fragrance and have had people ask me what perfume I was wearing, and said it smelled good.</li>
    <li> Love the way it lathers up and smells. Has a nice mellow scent. Been using the soap for a few weeks, can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working for my acne. It does however clean really well, without leaving my skin feeling dry and tight. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the company that sells these items, and I HATE the smell of this soap. Honey? No, more like black licorice and must. Not good.</li>
    <li> First off I bought this for my kids dry skin.  It smells nice but that&#x27;s all I can say it does.  But I didn&#x27;t use it every day b/c I didn&#x27;t want the fragrance to break them out!  So I would give it a 21/2 if I could! 50/50    One LOVE...</li>
    <li> Best soap in the world.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this soap for a couple of years and it has helped my wife&#x27;s acne tremendously. I have problems with dry skin in the winter and this soap does a great job of cleaning my face without drying the skin out.</li>
    <li> The soap was nicely packaged. Once you open it up, it has a pleasant scent of Honey. One side of the soap is the honey and the other is Propolis, each side is a different color. I used this and love it. It makes your skin soft and a nice scent. I&#x27;m sure it has other properties that help your skin. So I decided to try it on my dog (who has  skin allergy). And I must say its great.She didn&#x27;t mind it one bit. I&#x27;m going to continue washing her with this soap as I noticed she&#x27;s not itching as much as she did prior to me using this soap. So I do believe this soap is helping.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I have ordered Manuka Honey Propolis soap. I had great service both times I dealt with this family owned company. My wife and daughter, they both have very delicate skin, and they have tried many different kinds and brands of soap, with more less the same result: itchy and dry skin. After they tried the Manuka soap they won&#x27;t use any other soap, they loved the smell and the way their skin feels. So, I know that I will be ordering frequently from this outstanding vendor.</li>
    <li> This Manuka \\&quot;Honey &amp; Propolis\\&quot; soap lasts for months, fights bacteria and acne, is non-drying and leaves my skin soft!  I typically dislike using products with fragrances, but... Have I mentioned that this soap smells absolutely delicious?  Well-worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Likely more favorable with women. I personally prefer the plain Manuka Soap.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin but no worries with this soap.I love this soap it has a really nice scent. If you looking for a great soap this is the one. I highly recommend this product. Really fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This soap has a delicate and delicious fragrance, produces lots of lather and rinses clean. It doesn&#x27;t take much to produce the lather, which makes me believe it will last quite a while, and the shape of the bar makes it easy to hold onto, ulike the rounded bars.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry afterwards, so I don&#x27;t have to rub down with lots of lotion.  The cost of this bar is more than I&#x27;d like to pay on a regular basis, so I probably won&#x27;t buy it that often; it would make a nice gift item, or a once-in-a-while indulgence.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I love the combination and how it leaves my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It is gentle and soothing on my acne prone skin. Does not make my skin dry.  It smells really good. Use it, it&#x27;s great ;)</li>
    <li> I use it for my face only and it is very calming, soothing to the skin. Cleanses well and makes it feel and look better.</li>
    <li> I adore this soap! It is very cleansing and moisturizing, and using this in conjunction with other Manuka Honey products has cleared up my skin greatly over the past two weeks. I am extremely satisfied and will repurchase.  Also, when I first received it, it had a very strong (honey and herbal) smell. However, after having it in the shower for the past couple of weeks, the smell is not so strong, and instead, is a very pleasant and light one.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading an article that recommended Manuka Honey. Manuka Honey is supposedly great at fighting staph infections as a natural antibiotic. It is also suppose to help with scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter caught a staph infection on her leg last year and she had another one this year that wasn&#x27;t as bad. I then had my first staph infection this year on the side of my cheek. It started out as a pimple and ended up being a staph infection. It left a purplish scar on my cheek. It was horrible. I tried all sorts of things to make the scar go away - Vitamin E oil, creams etc... This product was the only one that has helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lessened the scar on my face (not completely gone but it&#x27;s a dramatic difference). It left my skin feeling soft. My complexion is amazing. It&#x27;s even reduced my sun spots. I wash with it every night. Love it! I bought extra soap for my kids and husband. I think this will help us in fighting staph in the future.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this product.  Works great on my sensitive skin.  Even helped heal  a rash I had.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried honey soap, and I absolutely love it.  Coupled with NZ Fusion Botanicals Skin Clear Cream, my skin has not looked this good in years!</li>
    <li> Very natural, smells delicious, gentle on my hands. I keep mine at the kitchen sink. And it is large in size.</li>
    <li> Manuka honey is healing my ulcer so I decided to try the other products made from manuka honey.  Love this soap, it smells wonderful and leaves my skin clean and fresh.  Love it.</li>
    <li> LARGE bar of soap, so if it seems pricey, it&#x27;s worth it.  It has lasted me a long time.  It smells really nice but a natural smell, not a chemical perfumey smell which I cannot tolerate.  It also leaves my skin soft.  Honey and propolis -- good stuff.  Natural antibacterial ingredients.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased the manuka honey soap because of my winter dry skin.  I&#x27;ve heard of the benefits of the products.  It&#x27;s an amazing soap with thick, rich lather which doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  It has a gentle scent that is not overwhelming. I will purchase more in the future.  I can&#x27;t imagine being without it.</li>
    <li> The smell is so strong and unnatural. I won&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what I can use it for. Maybe wash my cloths with it.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, this soap is perfect for you!  Not only does it smell good, it leave your hands feeling smooth and moisturized.  I love this soap! Regarding delivery, very fast and efficient.  It came before the date!</li>
    <li> Very nice for a commercial soap. It leaves my skin feeling clean without drying!</li>
    <li> This soap smells so wonderful and makes a great&lt;br /&gt;lather.  It makes skin soft and silky and I plan to&lt;br /&gt;put it on my autoship so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this soap would help my acne and seb derm; however, no such luck. Although it didn&#x27;t help, it didn&#x27;t make things worse either. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin at all, and makes the skin soft right after its use. I used the soap for a good 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is a good size bar soap that has a nice honey scent. I bought it to use as a facial cleanser for my acne, but found that it was a little too drying for my aging skin. It cleaned my face very well...perhaps too well. I was squeeky clean after rinsing, and my skin was a little tight. I&#x27;m using it now as a hand soap in the downstairs bath. It works well and leaves the room with a lovely fragrance after using it. I think that this would be a good bar for a younger, more oily skin type.</li>
    <li> For the past 4 years, during the warm weather (June through October) I get a rash where the underwire of my bra rests.  I politely like to refer to it as a heat rash. However, my Doctor advises that it is a fungal infection rash.  I have tried several creams and powders.  Both over the counter and Doctor prescribed and none of them worked.  Most of them did not even help.     After reading the reviews for Manuka Honey &amp; Propolis Soap, I thought is was worth a try.  I used the soap twice a day, for 9 days and the rash was gone.  Completely gone!  Now I&#x27;m using it once a day and even on the hottest days, there is no sign of its return.  This soap lathers well.  Just roll it in wet hands for a few seconds.  The soap smells nice and it leaves the skin felling clean, but not dried-out.  I love this soap!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this soap from this same seller multiple times.  I have severely dry, itchy skin and most soaps dry me out horribly, but this soap smells and feels amazing.  And it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on the children.  My youngest had dry patches on her legs and this soap made a huge difference with that.  The honey smell that comes off this soap is very strong.  Delicious-smelling, one might say ;)  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I live in a humid climate and my skin gets very oily sometimes even with only a light moisturizer. I bought this soap for its purported acne-clearing abilities, and wanted something that would not be over-drying. My face is not broken out right now but after several days of extreme humidity it does feel uncomfortably oily. I&#x27;ve used it for three days now instead of my regular cleanser and what a relief! My face feels soft and oil-free yet not tight and dry as other soaps have left it. It smells good and does not bother my sensitive skin. I may be using it every day now that summer is almost upon us. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, just some bare minerals blush and lipstick and this removes it very well; there seems to be no residue left on my skin. I still always use a toner after cleansing just to make sure all the make-up and grime from the day is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this highly for mature skin like mine (48 - that is considered \\&quot;mature\\&quot;, right?!) that is sensitive and needs a little balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another great product from Koru Naturals!</li>
    <li> Loved the soap. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve bought it. Somewhat expensive but makes an excellent lather, smells good and has been great for keeping my face clear of blemishes.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed showering with it so much that I&#x27;m getting some more as presents for my family.  Not the cheapest way to keep clean but certainly a most enjoyable experience.</li>
    <li> ordered for Christmas gift, nice soap, I will order this for my family now, lovely shipping and great gift, try all the soaps and shamppo&#x27;s</li>
    <li> but I got this for my sensitive skin.  It seems like the ingredients might be separated.  for the first half / on the outside half it seemed like it was really very rich in honey and my skin liked it but half thru it lost its honey smell and smelled more like a harsh soap and my skin started to get really sensitive - it&#x27;s taken about a week of using a different product to get my skin to calm down.  It could be just me or as suggested - I&#x27;m not sure.  I&#x27;d recommend this for hand soap especially in a guest bath as mentioned the outside half smells and looks really nice but not for bathing sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I do like this Manuka Honey and Propolis soap. It&#x27;s soothing for sensitive skin. Manuka honey has excellent healing properties. This soap also smells good enough to eat; it smells of real Manuka honey.</li>
    <li> What a nice soap for your skin. It rejuvenates and refreshes so my skin glowed.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughters like to use this soap to wash their face,</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap for the health benefits of the honey.  I have very sensitive skin, as well as a sensitivity to fragrances.  I love this soap and the way it makes my skin feel!  I have been using high-end shower gels for years, but I will now continue to use the Manuka Honey and Propolis Soap.  My skin feels soft and does not itch (as it does when I use most soaps).  I even feel comfortable using it on my face.  The soap is lasting a long time.  I would feel comfortable purchasing this product as a gift for someone who likes  luxury personal care items.</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong with honey. I love products made from honey and this is not exception. love the packaging too.</li>
    <li> As I stated before, Manuka honey is my salvation, and I use it all the time!!!!!!!!  I would recommend these items to all my friends.</li>
    <li> makes my body feel great</li>
    <li> This soap is a pleasure to use.  It is so gentle, doesn&#x27;t make a lot of lather, and leaves your skin feeling really smooth.  It seems to invigorate the skin.  This is my second order. I really enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> To fragrant for the migrainers, severe headaches. Lathers up well. Fragrant free, less smell would be great. why is it asking for more words?</li>
    <li> Great soap. Beautiful lather, clean rinsing, feels soft as you wash and when you rinse your skin feels wonderful, soft and smooth. I also think it helps calm blemishes if you&#x27;re prone to them, but i would use this for any type of skin.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this soap as it does, indeed, smell like honey. It is a bit pricey but I wouldn&#x27;t be against buying more later on. I am not using this for any condition so I can&#x27;t testify as to its efficacy in treating any maladies. I just like to try different soaps out.</li>
    <li> Whenever I have a bad breakout, this soap helps to dry them up and heal fast. I even use it after a really hard workout or when my face is more oily than usual. I&#x27;ve noticed that some reviews say that it&#x27;s hydrating? For me, it has a more drying effect, but not too drying.</li>
    <li> This product smells good and makes the skin soft. I have noticed a slight reduction in my cystic acne breakouts, but that could just be wishful thinking. Definitely a good purchase for the money, as I have used the bar almost twice a day for several weeks now and I still have a lot left.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It definitely doesn&#x27;t help with my acne as much as some other reviews made it seem like it would.  I&#x27;m not sure it really helped at all, to be honest. When I first started using the soap, the smell was pretty powerful..kinda bad.  Using actual manuka honey has helped my skin a million times more than this soap.  Plus, this stuff really dries my skin out.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but I really liked this soap.  I felt clean without being dried out like other soap brands.  This stuff is really nice on your face too.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this soap yet. But if it performs anything like the other Manuka products I have purchased, it ought to be wonderful. I suffer from very dry skin in the winter, especially. so this soap should handle those dry skin patches with ease.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using this instead of regular soap in my showers. I&#x27;ll just have to keep everybody else&#x27;s hands off of it !!</li>
    <li> Smell is lovely, hoping to help clear acne for my daughter, just started using the bar, and with luck will have positive things to report.</li>
    <li> Got this but thought it would be all natural without fragrance.  But it has other ingredients and I couldn&#x27;t tell that from the site so I&#x27;ll now give it as a gift as I don&#x27;t use synthetic fragrances.  Would probably be perfect without the fragrance added.</li>
    <li> Average ok. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and goes a loooong way</li>
    <li> You can instantly feel your skin so moist and gentle, I prefer this product better than any other expensive name brand cleansers, like Shiseido, lancom  etc....</li>
    <li> love this soap, it works great on my skin, helping to clear it up.</li>
    <li> This was a neat soap, but probably not worth the price. This is a good product that was as described in the Amazon description. It arrived on time, was well packaged, and had no damage.</li>
    <li> When there is more perfume than honey how good can it be. And red #4....BOO</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s interesting and so forth, although I probably would not order it again.  But very interested in the Manuka honey products and in their healing properties so will order other products.  Shipping on this was way too much!</li>
    <li> Thank goodness Koru Naturals. I had purchased this soap in 2001 during a trip to New Zealand. It is wonderful for feeling clean but doesn&#x27;t make you skin tight. I have been looking for some since the NZ store in Los Angeles left the internet. Koru Naturals had the product to me in 3 days from ordering. They are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> I bought this to give as a Christmas present &amp; ended up keeping it for myself.  The soap is wonderful.  My skin is so soft.</li>
