<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are amazing brushes they are so soft the don&#x27;t shed after you&#x27;ve washed them and they pick up product like a dream!</li>
    <li> The bigger brushes are good, soft and dense but the smaller ones not that great too stiff for my liking. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these brushes.  They aren&#x27;t Sigma but they do the job</li>
    <li> Nice quality brushes! worth the money! I use them more than my mac ones.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a hit and miss. I maybe kept 5-7 of these brushes, the rest were just useless. Thought it could be a dupe for the sigma brush set but not at all. Good alternative if you&#x27;re on a budget, or a beginner, and just need the basics.</li>
    <li> The brushes were a lot better than I had expected.  They&#x27;re really soft but with the right amount of density. They aren&#x27;t Sigma for sure but close to comparable. These are perfect for someone that is pretty new to make up applications and just need something to experiment with. I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes a lot. I don&#x27;t use all of the but the ones that I do use I enjoy using and they are super soft.</li>
    <li> Ok, idk where to start....I ordered these brushes based on the reviews people left...i figured id try them out since they wouldn&#x27;t break the bank...they are not good quality at all... the hairs on the brush aren&#x27;t even, the fluffy brushes aren&#x27;t fluffy and good for blending..they&#x27;re just very poor quality. For anyone who uses MAC, SIGMA or any professional brushes.. you will NOT like these.. at all.  These brushes are good for a young girl, who is just starting out with makeup.</li>
    <li> For the price these are these are amazing! Around 15 dollars for 15 brushes. The synthetic hair is soft and so smooth! My expectation was met and exceeded. No were else can you get this quality for this price. This is a good addition to an brush collection has all the brushes that are not readily available at a normal store you go to looking for brushes. I washed them as soon as them came and almost no shedding, like maybe one hair off of the large powder brush &#x27;</li>
    <li> I actually love each and every brush in the set. I am a makeup artist and people think you need sigma or morpe brushes to get a flawless look, ut that is not the case. I love these brushes and use it on my clients. When I first got them there was no shedding. After washing them twice the cleaned off well and went back t their original softness. love them.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the quality. I sent them back.</li>
    <li> What can i say about these brushes? They are soooooooooooo beautiful. I fell in love with them, they are so soft &amp; work wonders. They do a great job. I use them every day! The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the blending brush, it is not as fluffy as i thought it was. It doesn&#x27;t really help blend out my eyeshadow. But since all of the rest are phenomenal i worked my way around it. If you are looking for a brush set this one is the one. It has everything you need.</li>
    <li> Amazing starter kit for the price. I got this for my younger sisternecause she wanted to start using more brushes. When they arrived on time we were truly impressed. We even compared them to my Mac and bdellium brushes. The quality is steady and we&#x27;ll crafted for the price. I would recommend to anyone starting a freelance kit or a beginner in makeup</li>
    <li> I had bought this brand BESTOPE brushes before and loved it, these brushes are super soft and the quality is great, but the brushes that I received this time are not the same as described by the seller as you can see in my pictures, I&#x27;m disappointed but I&#x27;m keeping the brushes because of quality, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying these brushes. Some are nicer than others, but for the ones that are really nice, makes it worth every penny.</li>
    <li> These brushes awesome. Soft, persise and sturdy. Work great for a full face of make up. These brushes will not act like what you pay for them. They are high end brushes with out the high end price.</li>
