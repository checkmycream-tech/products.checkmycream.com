      <li>after using several of those, I noticed they are not leak-proof (if you put it in your purse) and are fragile (cracks appeared right after I started using a few for travel).</li>

    <li> These are a nice size.  They look prety.  I just like the round containers better.  They take up a little bit more space when I send them out.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for giving out little samples for any product. I also love the style of the sample containers. The square is different compared to the usual rounded ones...</li>
    <li> Price great and perfect for my Younique samples. Will wish for purple lids?! Price also not to rise but like .50cents! Like the mix up for those of us rely on small sample containers it&#x27;s nice to have a mix of colors. 3 to 5 grams perfect size as well. Happy with the 3grams myself. If anyone locates purple in a larger set then 12 please contact me at elmore_trish@yahoo.com Thanks</li>
    <li> These containers were for a wedding shower favor. I filled them with organic Shea butter and labeled them with printed Avery labels. Good quality container, holds the right amount. Very cute and useful favors. Whew!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and received it very quickly. The design of the containers fit very well for storage and I am personally using them to store glitter but purchased them thinking they would be big enough to make my acrylic mixes. But that was my mistake I miscalculated the size I ordered. That was the only downfall and thus the answer for the less than perfect score. I would reccomend to anyone looking to maybe make their own eyeshadow or lip gloss or something like that!</li>
    <li> I went through many different ads till I found what I wanted. These are exactly what I needed. Exactly as described. Arrived in record time. Even though I ordered several items from different sellers I was able to check out one time, make one total payment and my order arrived correctly, even though different vendors were involved. Makes for an easy transaction for me, the consumer. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> perfect for what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Great for lipstick depoting, stands the heat to melt the lipstick and cream shadows, looks great after done. Very good quality, worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are PERFECT for traveling and keeping my quart bag within the guidelines for TSA. They actually hold quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I like this, is for my first proyect, I don&#x27;t do it yet, but I think is perfect for lip scrubs, and the price is right, I stared collecting all stuff for quinciañera gives aways,  I believe I going need Moore,</li>
    <li> These are really nice cosmetic containers. They are quite small and crystal clear, more appropriate for lip gloss, eye cream, or eye shadow, but would work well for travel. I actually bought them for use in crafting.</li>
    <li> These are my second favorite sample size pots. They hold a good amount of loose powder cosmetics. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for what I needed.  I had a hard time finding jars this small.  Worth the money, and came quickly.  I make my own lip gloss and this was just the right size for a small purse.  Great item.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> these are perfect for my homemade pigments.They are cute and don&#x27;r scream cheap even though they were very very affordable. my customers will love them! thanks</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my daughter to conjure up some solid perfume and she said they were very nice &amp; just perfect for her application...</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Perfect for my DIY lip gloss and eye shadows.</li>
    <li> Decent product, does the job.  Update: after using several of those, I noticed they are not leak-proof (if you put it in your purse) and are fragile (cracks appeared right after I started using a few for travel). They are just the right size for eye shadow if you keep them at home.</li>
    <li> They are very nice for samples and smaller amount of products although it seems like the cap does not stay on too well so I wouldn&#x27;t trust taking it along on travels or in a bag. Also, I suggest getting the sifter ones.</li>
    <li> Wish these were a bit larger, but as is, will hold my DIY glosses just fine.</li>
    <li> I love these little containers. The tops fit tight and they do not untwist themselves easily loose in my purse. They make good containers to give samples to friends or to make your own crayon lipstick! All of the lids fit and they came shipped quickly! I will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> These are great for lipstick or lip quenchers, when I get to the bottom all I do is scoop the remaining lipstick, etc. into these little containers so I don&#x27;t have to throw my lipsticks out when there is still some left in the tube.</li>
    <li> very nice.  I use for skin treatments (I use cortisone lotion every day) and other creams and liquids that I travel with, and also samples of stuff I want my daughter to try.  GREAT quality!</li>
    <li> Perfectly shaped for what I was intending them for.  Arrival took a little longer than I anticipated, but pleased with the packaging!</li>
    <li> perfect for my essential oil chapsticks that i made.</li>
    <li> Great little containers! Good quality, exactly as described and perfect for sampling! Good value!</li>
    <li> Great product, nice size, Great for body cream. Used them for gifts for a women&#x27;s retreat. Easy screw on and screw off!</li>
    <li> Love these containers! Perfect for giving samples of my mineral makeup. I will be a regular customer.</li>
    <li> Perfect little containers!  I use them for sample serums!</li>
