    <li> Wonderful when you are ill and cannot shampoo hair.  Cleans without water.</li>
    <li> These were incredible! I used these for my boyfriend when he was in the hospital for three months. I cannot believe how well these worked. I could not tell the difference between using these and really washing his hair with soap and water. I don&#x27;t think I would be great for someone with long hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great, easy to use and works well to clean hair. My grandmother is 95 and we purchase them for her use, she can use them easily and they work very well. Great product for anyone who cannot wash hair under sink or get into shower.</li>
    <li> the best thing there is for washing your hair when you have health problems</li>

    <li> It works great for my mom who is bedridden. Her hair never looked this good or clean before we started using No Rinse Shampoo Caps! Thanks for making this product!</li>
    <li> Not satisfied...hair still feels greasy. Not worth the money! Would return product if postage was prepaid. Would give no star if possible!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent prive</li>
    <li> easy to use and does a good job</li>
    <li> These caps are very helpful to assist elderly people to care for their hair.  Often the thought of washing their hair is a daunting task.  With these it is a breeze.</li>
    <li> These work really well. For the caregiver, they are easy to use. For the patient, non invasive and a feeling of fresh and clean upon completion of use.</li>
    <li> This product is great for those persons that are bed-bound. It&#x27;s a real miracle for people unable to get up to wash their hair.</li>
    <li> Unlike the shampoo cap I was given in the hospital, four years ago, this one was too large for really short hair, with way too much shampoo in it. Even after combing through my hair (taking a ton of shampoo with each stroke), it lay so heavy in my hair that I absolutely had to rinse it. I&#x27;ll be returning the whole box, as I used one that I had bought in a pharmacy. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The worked very well and we are very pleased with them.  Enough so, that we will probably be getting more soon.&lt;br /&gt;We have a son with cerebral palsy who had major surgery (spinal straightening) and washing him can be a bit uncomfortable for both he and I and trying to wash his hair in the sink is impossible and in the shower and tub is an ordeal, SO, yes we rate this a 5</li>
    <li> Worked well but some residue left in hair.</li>
    <li> works well just don&#x27;t forget to towel dry</li>
