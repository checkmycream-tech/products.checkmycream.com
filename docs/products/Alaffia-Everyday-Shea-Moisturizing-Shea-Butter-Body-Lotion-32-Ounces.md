### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It smells awesome and is not sticky.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent moisturizer!</li>
      <li>Very good lotion with no garbage and quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>Be patient with this lotion and give it a chance, it is a great product.</li>
      <li>Nice stuff!  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also not that pleasant either.</li>
      <li>Good value for the money as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good quality lotion.</li>
      <li>I love the way this smells!</li>
      <li>excellent product - works great - lasts a long time - great for your skin and has a very lite fragrance and feel to it.</li>
      <li>Great price, big bottle, great moisturizing.</li>
      <li>My favorite lotion- the lavender is a refreshing</li>
      <li>I love vanilla.</li>
      <li>The process and good intentions of this company is just an added bonus to a great product at a low price.</li>
      <li>I had tried many, many lotions and had even slept in moisture barrier gloves overnight, which is a royal PITA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using these lotions for over a year and am OK with it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible smell</li>
      <li>This is my all-time favorite body lotion.</li>
      <li>The scent is DELICIOUS, not too sweet, and it makes your skin really soft.</li>
      <li>I LOVED being able to buy from a company where the money goes to such a great group of women, however the quality seems to have changed dramatically since I first started buying it.</li>
      <li>If you like strong vanilla, this will be 5 stars for you.  </li>
      <li>I like this because it is light.</li>
      <li>Like a light vanilla custard at the patisserie.</li>
      <li>This is a petroleum free line that uses hand crafted, unrefined Shea butter.</li>
      <li>I use it on my hands after I wash them or do light dishes.  </li>
      <li>Great for use after very drying work like pouring concrete or using mortor.</li>
      <li>It rubs in quickly, and I happen to like the vanilla scent, which is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Imgredients have changed from their original formulation.</li>
      <li>It fades somewhat quickly since it&#x27;s light.</li>
      <li>Next time, I am going for the unscented and then I will have The Greatest Natural Lotion Ever.</li>
      <li>Fair Trade makes this even better by supporting proper prices.</li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t let that distract from this being such a good lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light texture, hydrates right in and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
      <li>This lotion is moisturizing, protective, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>they went back to the better quality product they used to produce!</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin super soft, I love the consistency of this lotion.  </li>
      <li>and the lotion somehow watery and hydrating goes on in the most natural way.</li>
      <li>Also, the smell goes away pretty quickly after rubbing it in, seemingly also to do with the lower concentration of butters they seem to be using.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend using entirely fragrance free products b/c</li>
      <li>I first bought Everyday Shea unscented lotion, liked it so much I went to buy more, couldn&#x27;t find it, and therefore bought the vanilla.</li>
      <li>The lotion works good but the vanilla smell is a bit odd.</li>
      <li>This has a chemical like scent and does not make my skin feel smooth as the old formula did.</li>
      <li>It smells more bitter than it does sweet.</li>
      <li>I always dampen my hands first before rubbing in a small amount, and then I add even more and massage into my cuticles and fingertips where I have the most problem.  </li>
      <li>Even if I wear gloves to wash a lot of dishes, I put this lotion on first.  </li>
      <li>I have really dry skin, and I am so happy with how my arms and legs feel after I put this stuff on, deeply moisturized, and not oily.</li>
      <li>The price was always amazing for a natural lotion because the quantity would last you, even when buying it at Whole Foods Market.</li>
      <li>It is not creamy like the chemical laden lotions I am used to, but it is not greasy like the straight almond oil I was using as an alternative to them.</li>
      <li>Soaks up fast and quenches my thirsty skin.</li>
      <li>With this product, you get the benefits of Shea butter without having to melt it onto your skin and without having to deal with the greasiness of straight Shea.</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s responsibly made and the price is decent for the size of the bottle.</li>
      <li>The greasy stuff only does good when I use it OVER the Everyday Shea.</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the overpowering vanilla smell (caused by an actual extract, not a lab-created fragrance).  </li>
      <li>I have normal skin</li>
      <li>I use the Everyday Shea shampoo and bodywash and love them</li>
      <li>When my hands are really bad from chemicals or handy projects, I add a coat of greasy medical-grade lotion on top.  </li>
      <li>It does seem a little thin and runny, but it does a wonderful job moisturizing and I will continue to use Everyday Shea.</li>
      <li>Now it is much thinner and, therefore, does not last as long.</li>
      <li>This lotion is light enough to use everyday and you will smell yummy!</li>
      <li>so I highly doubt that this would work for dry skin.</li>
      <li>But what I really love about this lotion is that it keeps my hands from becoming the disaster that usually results from cold, dry winters.  </li>

<li> I have plenty of other heavier creams.  </li>
<li> If I&#x27;ve been in the sun a little too long, I add a little witch hazel and it helps a ton.</li>
<li> It used to be thick and definitely smell of the divine shea and/or cocoa butters used.</li>
<li> In addition, I have tried the shampoo and conditioners and they now have a very odd smell after breaking down in your hair...</li>
<li> I use Everyday Shea (vanilla) all over after a shower.  </li>
<li> Been using Everyday Shea for over 3 years now.  </li>
<li> I have never had luck with expensive medical-grade greasy lotions for my severely cracked skin in the winter.  </li>
<li> they could be dangerous and cause allergic reactions for some people.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves my skin super soft, I love the consistency of this lotion.  Next time I will get the unscented one!!</li>
    <li> I use the Everyday Shea shampoo and bodywash and love them so I decided to get some of their lotion. The lotion works good but the vanilla smell is a bit odd. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell but it&#x27;s also not that pleasant either. It smells more bitter than it does sweet.</li>
    <li> Imgredients have changed from their original formulation. This has a chemical like scent and does not make my skin feel smooth as the old formula did. Instead it disappears as soon as I apply it and my skin is still thirsty. I have normal skin so I highly doubt that this would work for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I use Everyday Shea (vanilla) all over after a shower.  It rubs in quickly, and I happen to like the vanilla scent, which is not too strong.  But what I really love about this lotion is that it keeps my hands from becoming the disaster that usually results from cold, dry winters.  I use it on my hands after I wash them or do light dishes.  Even if I wear gloves to wash a lot of dishes, I put this lotion on first.  I have never had luck with expensive medical-grade greasy lotions for my severely cracked skin in the winter.  I had tried many, many lotions and had even slept in moisture barrier gloves overnight, which is a royal PITA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyday Shea is NOT greasy.  It forms sort of a waxy barrier on my hands, remaining there longer than other lotions--and other Shea lotions.  I know this because I can still feel it on my hands the next time they&#x27;re under water.  I always dampen my hands first before rubbing in a small amount, and then I add even more and massage into my cuticles and fingertips where I have the most problem.  Before bed, I add a third coat and don&#x27;t quite rub it in all the way, letting it settle around my fingernails.  I like that I can still open doors, use my phone, and handle bed linens, unlike with greasy lotion.  When my hands are really bad from chemicals or handy projects, I add a coat of greasy medical-grade lotion on top.  The greasy stuff only does good when I use it OVER the Everyday Shea.</li>
    <li> I first bought Everyday Shea unscented lotion, liked it so much I went to buy more, couldn&#x27;t find it, and therefore bought the vanilla.

    <li> I have no idea how people can give this stuff a low review.  The process and good intentions of this company is just an added bonus to a great product at a low price.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer! Soaks up fast and quenches my thirsty skin. If I&#x27;ve been in the sun a little too long, I add a little witch hazel and it helps a ton.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good quality lotion. Not greasy, absorbs well. The vanilla scent is minimal so if you really like a heavy scent, this might disappoint you. But don&#x27;t let that distract from this being such a good lotion.</li>

    <li> excellent product - works great - lasts a long time - great for your skin and has a very lite fragrance and feel to it.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion- the lavender is a refreshing aroma- and the lotion somehow watery and hydrating goes on in the most natural way. This lotion is one of the few out there that doesn&#x27;t have glycerin, so the feel is real.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite body lotion. The scent is DELICIOUS, not too sweet, and it makes your skin really soft. I always have a bottle of this in my house.</li>
    <li> The search is over!  After years of dry winter skin relieved only by paraben-laden synthetic lotions I finally found this gem!  All the natural lotions I had tried were either oily or stung my sensitive skin with excessive alcohol.  This lotion is moisturizing, protective, and absorbs quickly.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the overpowering vanilla smell (caused by an actual extract, not a lab-created fragrance).  If you like strong vanilla, this will be 5 stars for you.

    <li> Great price, big bottle, great moisturizing. This lotion is very different from the commercial stuff, in that it is watery and goes on drippy, like oil. It is not creamy like the chemical laden lotions I am used to, but it is not greasy like the straight almond oil I was using as an alternative to them. I have really dry skin, and I am so happy with how my arms and legs feel after I put this stuff on, deeply moisturized, and not oily. With this product, you get the benefits of Shea butter without having to melt it onto your skin and without having to deal with the greasiness of straight Shea. Be patient with this lotion and give it a chance, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love vanilla. This lotion is light enough to use everyday and you will smell yummy!</li>
