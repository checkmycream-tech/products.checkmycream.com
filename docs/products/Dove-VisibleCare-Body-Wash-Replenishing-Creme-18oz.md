      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I just love Dove products.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this body wash, but after using it for about a year I noticed my skin was a lot drier than before.</li>
      <li>I love this dove replenishing.</li>
      <li>Okay so...</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more:)</li>
      <li>so I tried it and boy was I ever glad I did.</li>
      <li>I have been using DOVE body wash for many many years and no other body wash smells as good as DOVE products and feel so good on the skin.</li>
      <li>not overpowering, but a nice clean</li>
      <li>I was never into body wash because I always liked the squeaky clean feeling of soap.</li>
      <li>Go Dove, you guys really created an amazing product!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m really excited!</li>
      <li>It came out at a perfect time being that my skin is so dry during the winter.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and I feel fresh and clean after stepping out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Helps you shower and moisturiz all in one step which I love to lather up and shower off to feel smooth; also great for baby&#x27;s skin and sensitive areas of the body!!</li>
      <li>It smells great, and it leaves you feeling soft like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>It got it fast and it was in really good conditions.</li>
      <li>Rinses away easily.</li>
      <li>It smells good and makes my skin alot softer, and  I have sensitive skin, but i havnt had any problems : )</li>
      <li>This is a very good body wash for dry skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is fine even though I&#x27;m allergic to fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
      <li>My skin was MUCH softer and generally in better condition after just one use!</li>
      <li>The texture of the body wash is so smooth and creamy, my skin literally absorbs it.</li>
      <li>And the skin feels smooth after the wash.</li>
      <li>The Body wash great, but expect a third to a quarter of the product to be stuck in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>However, I figured I already was getting free shipping, so I added it to my order for convenience.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not as diligent as most of my girlfriends, who moisturize right after they shower.</li>
      <li>This creamy, smooth body wash smells classically &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; and makes a great lather, leaves my skin a good balance between &amp;#34;clean feeling&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;moisturized&amp;#34; - not overly greasy on areas like my neck or back.</li>
      <li>Better than the most expensive, best rated shower products out there.  </li>
      <li>This body wash is worth the price!</li>
      <li>a big fan of dove have used the whole line since it came out very good product to use o</li>
      <li>It turned very lathery and smooth once under the shower though and has a strong clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>I will say that I have noticed an overall improvement in my skin&#x27;s moisture level after a good 5 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this one is not too fruity sweet smelling.</li>
      <li>Yes, for once in the history of advertising, what they say on the bottle is true.</li>
      <li>, creme based body wash has a clean fresh fragrance that goes with my more expensive parfume perfectly.</li>
      <li>It smells clean and fresh and it&lt;</li>
      <li>Dove VisibleCare is a wonderful bodywash, where only a bit is necessary for lots of moisturizing suds.  </li>
      <li>I think this one was better than everything else I have tried as far as cleaning the skin and making it smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I have also noticed this body wash tends to go a long way and is good for shaving, too.</li>
      <li>but really didn&#x27;t like the strong scent.</li>
      <li>It concerned me at first because I thought I had mistakenly bought a lotion!</li>
      <li>The sent is soft and clean, not too strong.</li>
      <li>It is worth it.</li>
      <li>This Dove body wash is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin so soft and smooth, but clean at the same time!The lather is great and keeps going strong, even when you&#x27;ve reached the last part of your body.</li>
      <li>I like the texture though and how much it lathers up, makes it much easier to apply than the more liquidy body wash I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>Dove has always been a good product, that is why I tries it</li>
      <li>I usually choose something very moisturizing, and this does a very good job.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Absolutely rinses clean off.  </li>

    <li> This creamy, smooth body wash smells classically &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; and makes a great lather, leaves my skin a good balance between &amp;#34;clean feeling&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;moisturized&amp;#34; - not overly greasy on areas like my neck or back. I have also noticed this body wash tends to go a long way and is good for shaving, too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally care about what soap I use. In fact, I nearly always buy what is on sale. Last week the Dove VisibleCare was on sale - and now I am hooked. Best body wash I have ever used. I won&#x27;t be going back. It smells good and makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> This was recommended for a family member by their dermatologist so I tried it.  At first, I was skeptical, but the stuff works well as this has been the first winter without dry skin that I can remember. The scent (reminds me of my second grade teacher) is not overwhelming. I am re-ordering.  I now understand why it is a little more expensive than the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Dove.It is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash ! I think it helps and i think i noticed a difference. It smells good and makes my skin alot softer, and  I have sensitive skin, but i havnt had any problems : ) so i am low on this right now , but i am trying out the new \\&quot;toning\\&quot; dove wash, il see how that one works too lol ; D</li>
    <li> Just got this body wash a few days ago and it is *ABSOLUTELY* amazing! I have very sensitive and dry skin and this body wash really locks in moisture and I have noticed just in the past few days that my skin is already so much softer and smoother. This Dove product also has a really nice texture to it. I have used dozens of different body washes (all sorts of different brands) and this one is definitely my favorite!! Go Dove, you guys really created an amazing product!</li>
    <li> This product is better than i expected. I have dark skin and suffer from very dry skin. I noticed the difference in the feel and texture of my skin within 5 days (of daily use). After one week as advertised, your skin is baby soft &amp; smooth. It does also help if your lotion contains shea butter and/or olive oil.</li>
    <li> Dove is always excellent product, no complain, good to get at better than discount club store.</li>
    <li> This soap leaves your skin like you had used the best body oil after your shower. Super soft skin. The feeling last all day long! Better than the most expensive, best rated shower products out there.  You need to try this!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally a big fan of Dove products, e.g. shampoo/conditioner, lotions, and bodywash but the renewing cream body wash takes the blue-ribbon prize. It came out at a perfect time being that my skin is so dry during the winter. Like the previous reviewer, I really like the texture and it has just the perfect amount of scent, AND it really does feel like my skin is softer and definitely less dry after only a few days of use!</li>
    <li> Dove VisibleCare is a wonderful bodywash, where only a bit is necessary for lots of moisturizing suds.  Absolutely rinses clean off.  My only real issue is with the intense fragrance (reminds me of a cross between Irish Spring and Axe body spray).  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or any problems with fragrance in general, but nothing on this product warns about fragrance to those who DO have these sensitivities - you can&#x27;t even smell the product until you squeeze a bit out onto your washcloth or loofa.  Unfortunately I have yet to find a &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; or &#x27;fragrance free&#x27; version of Dove VisibleCare, which is VERY odd considering Dove is always one of the recommended soaps for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great bodywash for moisturizing, but subtracting one star here for fragrance over-kill.</li>
    <li> Okay so...WOW! I&#x27;m not usually amazed with any beauty products I use - they are all advertised as \\&quot;the miracle\\&quot; this or that, and (for me, anyway) they all tend to work about the same. However, this stuff is amazing! (Again, for me, anyway... Everyone&#x27;s skin is different.) My skin was MUCH softer and generally in better condition after just one use! The sent is soft and clean, not too strong. I&#x27;ve used many different body washes of varying prices and never have they worked so well. In addition, I have tried other Dove products in the past (hair care, mainly) and they didn&#x27;t work so well, but after reading some of the earlier reviews here I decided to try this. So glad I did! I&#x27;m 35 and pretty much live at the beach in the summer so my skin needs all the help it can get. ;) We&#x27;ll see if this stuff can tackle my super-dry winter skin soon enough...</li>
    <li> I totally love DOVE products especially body care products. I have been using DOVE body wash for many many years and no other body wash smells as good as DOVE products and feel so good on the skin. This particular body wash is sold for $7 in target and it&#x27;s a STEAL on Amazon if you subscribe. The texture of the body wash is so smooth and creamy, my skin literally absorbs it. And the smell is just ahhhhh.... I have tried the other colors as well but I always keep coming back to the blue one for the scent.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Dove Visible care renewing\\&quot;, creme based body wash has a clean fresh fragrance that goes with my more expensive parfume perfectly. You know how some body conditioners have complex cheap smells; that you can&#x27;t wash with, &amp; then put on your perfume of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one in particular works very well if you wash first, then use it like a rinse. Rub it on as a conditioner, just like after washing your hair; then rinse. You can wash with it too, but I just like it this way best. There is a softer look, to my arms legs, and feet; that was noticable within 3 days. Don&#x27;t forget to add a little body lotion to your routine. Yes this stuff works, but it doesn&#x27;t work miracles. Please no more cracked heels, ashy ankles and ashy elbows!</li>
    <li> This body wash is worth the price! I was hesitant, but I used Dove body wash while visiting a family member and loved it. This body wash leaves my skin looking and feeling soft and clean! It is so gentle (I am very sensitive and react to many lotions and soaps) and, I feel, visibly improves how my skin looks.  It also has a light scent that I think is very nice! I would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a body wash that I can continue to use and this is it!  It has a great fresh \\&quot;soap\\&quot; smell vs. all of the fruity stuff that is out there.  It also lathers really great and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.  You can even use it to shave and it works great.  Very mosturizing as well. The best!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first ever review I&#x27;ve ever written. I just had to write since this has been a daily game changer for me. I&#x27;m not as diligent as most of my girlfriends, who moisturize right after they shower. So unfortunately, in the winter months, I typically have scaly, dry skin on my legs (I know gross...poor hubby). BUT NOW, with this Dove bodywash, without even putting on additional moisturizer, I NO LONGER HAVE SCALY DRY SKIN! Can&#x27;t tell you happy (and hubby) are with this product. You must try it yourself!</li>
    <li> This is really thick, so you can use less than you normally would for shower soap. It also smells really nice and is great for softening skin.</li>
    <li> I expected more when I bought this item. At first I felt some difference (in the first days). Now, it&#x27;s been a week, and I think it&#x27;s just an ordinary body wash.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fine even though I&#x27;m allergic to fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather use what the skin Dr presdribes like BABE for example.</li>
    <li> Dove VisibleCare Body Wash has a nice texture and pleasant scent.  I think it moisturizes better than Dove Moisturizing Body Wash, which I used to use.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin, so have to use products carefully. This one works very nicely on my dry skin. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use dove soap, this is a great compliment to bath time.  The replenishing cream live skin feeling soft and moist for a long time after the shower.  Really s,mooth and creamy will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this had &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; of some sort for scrubbing skin.  I probably won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash.  It gets you clean and smelling great.  Makes you feel clean, and does not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> This Dove body wash is by far my favorite. I did not expect to see results within a week. I only bought it as I change my body wash often, but this body wash produced amazing results; I don&#x27;t even have bad skin! Since it was so effective, my husband started using it too! It smells great, and it leaves you feeling soft like a baby&#x27;s bottom. High five!</li>
    <li> Helps you shower and moisturiz all in one step which I love to lather up and shower off to feel smooth; also great for baby&#x27;s skin and sensitive areas of the body!!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to everything! My doctor recommended this and it has done wonders for my skin. I absolutely love this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few varieties of body washes and soaps (Ivory, Equate Sensitive Skin from Wallyworld, Olay, just to name a few), and this is by far the best. They call it \\&quot;visible care\\&quot; for a reason, at least in my case. I have very sensitive skin, and once I started using this, over time I could actually see my skin improve...in only about five days. I like the smell too...not overpowering, but a nice clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative, at least at first, was the size. You get 18 ounces, and with some other choices, you can get 24 ounces for about the same price. However, one point to note with this one is that you don&#x27;t need much at all. Just put a few drops of this Dove body wash on a bath sponge and it will give you plenty of lather. Once I get down to a small amount left in the container, I pop off the top and add water to it, and that makes it last even longer (yes, I&#x27;m a bit of a tightwad...I also get every bit out of a toothpaste tube before I discard it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend not only this product, but all of the Dove Visible Care choices. This is all I want to use now....my only worry is they might stop producing it!</li>
    <li> I have tried many body washes, but none that ACTUALLY IMPROVED MY SKIN! Yes, for once in the history of advertising, what they say on the bottle is true. It really did improve the look and feel of my skin in two weeks! My skin is softer, smoother, and has less little bumps to the texture I didn&#x27;t know I could have skin like this from a body wash! It seriously is a god send, it&#x27;s the only thing I use now. I buy it by the bulk. Dove, please don&#x27;t change your formula!</li>
    <li> Since adidas stopped making their body wash, I gave Old Spice a try but really didn&#x27;t like the strong scent. Dove is nice and subtle, so I definitely enjoy this more than the Old Spice. It&#x27;s not as good as what Adidas used to make, but the best alternative I could find.</li>
    <li> I use this product when do not have Village products to use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this bodywash to death! I&#x27;m pretty sure all of the visible care bodywashes are great, this is just the one I happened to pick out. I have been on a search for the perfect staple bodywash for years and I have finally found it. It has a very thick consistency and I tend to use alot of it so I go through the bottle fast. It leaves my skin so soft and smooth, but clean at the same time!The lather is great and keeps going strong, even when you&#x27;ve reached the last part of your body. I use this every time I shower. I like the scent, smells a bit perfumey, but does not linger. I&#x27;ve always ha a problem with dry skin on my lower back, but this bodywash keeps it under control. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more:)</li>
    <li> As a person who suffers from dry skin, I was immediately drawn to this product that contains Dove&#x27;s greatest concentration of &#x27;Nutrium-moisture&#x27;. I previously used Dove&#x27;s &#x27;Deep Moisture&#x27; with fairly good results as well. Glycerin, a powerful natural moisturizer, is listed as the second ingredient making it the main moisturizing agent in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, even though this product is commercially targeted at women, the fragrance used is very unisex and either male or female can use it. The smell is pleasant and I feel fresh and clean after stepping out of the shower. My sensitive skin has taken to this body wash and did not feel dry or irritated. The bottle claims that you will have smoother skin after 1 week and noticeable change after 3 weeks of continued use. I will say that I have noticed an overall improvement in my skin&#x27;s moisture level after a good 5 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the amount of chemical agents in this product. For those of us with very sensitive skin, sticking to more natural ingredients in body washes is a safer bet (via Aveeno, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove VisibleCare Renewing is on the slightly pricier side, but keep an eye out for coupons since this Dove line is new. I bought my bottle at Walmart for $4.74 after using a $1 off coupon printed off from Dove.com. Overall a good product, but the non-natural ingredients aren&#x27;t fully to my liking and not much sticks out about it otherwise.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading some reviews because I saw some people had luck with this body wash helping them get rid of their body acne (bacne...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey for what I&#x27;m used to, but I think I have been noticing a bit of a difference on my back. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks now so we&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s actually getting any better or just my wishful thinking. I like the texture though and how much it lathers up, makes it much easier to apply than the more liquidy body wash I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for a year now for 5 to 7 dollars but suddenly the price is skyrocketing.  Frankly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than the other Dove shower cream gels.  I&#x27;ve bought about 5 different scents and types and they&#x27;re all okay but this one is not too fruity sweet smelling.Other than that it&#x27;s okay,nothing special.</li>
    <li> This is a very good body wash for dry skin. It&#x27;s thick and creamy. Rinses away easily. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bottom line: If you have sensitive skin stay away from this body wash. I never get breakouts on my body and I mean never! This wash introduced me to my first body breakout (back and legs...weird) and both me and my skin were very irritated by the outcome. I took a look through the ingredients (after it was too late unfortunately)...no parabens, but I believe the fragrance is the culprit. I don&#x27;t know that someone with sensitive skin can claim this is a smart buy (as other reviewers here do, unless you have *really* dry skin). The &#x27;creme&#x27; label is a dead give away for oily skin types to steer clear of course, but for a company that consistently touts their products &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin accomodations, why include such a notorious irritant (aka fragrance)?</li>
    <li> I love this dove replenishing. It leaves my skin so soft and smooth. As long as Dove keeps making this, I&#x27;m going to keep buying it! Love it!</li>
    <li> It actually did what it said it would do and kept me moisturized.  I really did have to use LESS lotion.  Great smell too.  A bit expensive though.</li>
    <li> And that&#x27;s what matters. I got it for her to try, when I had some kind of coupon or discount, and she really liked the way it smelled. She didn&#x27;t notice and &amp;#34;visible&amp;#34; change in her skin appearance in the two or three months it lasted, but, I don&#x27;t think anyone really expects it to do that. I&#x27;m not sure why companies claim things like that.</li>
    <li> The Body wash great, but expect a third to a quarter of the product to be stuck in the bottle.  I don&#x27;t know if they designed it this way on purpose, but I had to stick my finger up into the bottle for over a week to get the rest of it out.  The bottom is not squeezable, and the body lotion gets stuck in the sides the way they designed it.  I finally got tired of eking small amounts out and threw the rest away.  I WILL NOT buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. I have dry skin. This body wash really cleans skin. And the skin feels smooth after the wash. Does not leave a greasy film like some other body washes. I have tried different Nivea, Olay and Clean &amp; Clear. I think this one was better than everything else I have tried as far as cleaning the skin and making it smooth and hydrated. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this, it leaves my skin soft and comfortable.  The price was good so I bought 2.  Dove has always been a good product, that is why I tries it and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;m 61 and need the help.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> This comes in a nice large size and I was surprised by how thick the soap was. It concerned me at first because I thought I had mistakenly bought a lotion! It turned very lathery and smooth once under the shower though and has a strong clean fragrance. I do not have sensitive skin so I am not sure whether this would affect sensitive types so use caution if fragrant soaps make you itch or hive up. Altogether a lovely product!</li>
    <li> I just love Dove products. They leave my skin feeling soft and clean. They smell amazing. They&#x27;re a 10 in my book.</li>
    <li> This one of the best body washes I have ever used. It smells clean and fresh and it&lt;br /&gt;suds up like whipped cream and leaves your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this body wash, but after using it for about a year I noticed my skin was a lot drier than before. I have since switched to the Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was never into body wash because I always liked the squeaky clean feeling of soap. But I slept over my friend&#x27;s apt over the weekend and she had a sample of this body wash so I tried it and boy was I ever glad I did. The moment i squeezed the cream out of the tube, it was like heavenly indulgent whipped cream for my body. It was one of the best showers I&#x27;ve ever had. I went straight to CVS to buy this product after I left her apartment and now, after using it for only 3 days, my skin, which I constantly have to put lotion on usually because its very dry and tends to get scaly during winter, is really soft (and after only 3 days!!). I can&#x27;t imagine what my skin will feel like at the end of the week but I&#x27;m really excited! I&#x27;m sure my husband will notice and appreciate this product when he feels my skin!! Even just after using it once I already felt the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!! I&#x27;m now a believer in Dove Body wash!! Well particularly this line!</li>
    <li> I have eczema, so I&#x27;m pretty picky about my body wash (I don&#x27;t want to dry out my skin even more). I usually choose something very moisturizing, and this does a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a college student, so I&#x27;m pretty young. But the scent of this body wash is definitely something you&#x27;d expect to smell on an older woman. But if you&#x27;re okay with that, then this is a very good product to order.</li>
    <li> My step daughter has not complained about her dry skin since she start using this body wash Thank you</li>
    <li> There is a visible difference. Everything about this product is wonderful. Can be used all over. Pamper yourself. I use with an ultra soft sponge .</li>
    <li> The body wash was great. I loved it. It got it fast and it was in really good conditions. Like I said, I loved it</li>
    <li> I usually use body wash when showering because it is convenient, fast, and not messy if you use a nylon shower &amp;#34;ruffle&amp;#34; that easily hangs in your shower.  It lasts a long time. I can feel it work in my skin when I use it.</li>
    <li> My skin feel dry since winter, and usually I apply layers of body butter/lotion after showering.  But this one help relieve the dry feeling and sometimes I even can skip the body butter step and stay moisturized and fresh. Nice buy!</li>
    <li> This bottle is actually bigger than I can get at any of my local stores (discount stores, grocery stores, and pharmacies included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I hesitated buying it because it was the same price i could buy it for locally.  However, I figured I already was getting free shipping, so I added it to my order for convenience.  To my surprise, it is definitely larger than the largest size available in my area stores (suburb of Kansas City, MO).</li>
    <li> a big fan of dove have used the whole line since it came out very good product to use o</li>
    <li> Great body wash leaves ur skin fresh</li>
    <li> My skin is dry and owing to the windy weather in the new city, it gets drier.&lt;br /&gt;this body wash is kind of saving me. it is really moist.</li>
