      <li>nice starter to try product</li>
      <li>but I use a nice smelling mousse, so nobody else notices the product smell.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly luxurious, rich shampoo, like a nice salon shampoo, smells good, so it&#x27;s kind of invigorating.</li>
      <li>Am I ever so happy that I made the right decision!</li>
      <li>But, my hair gets really frizzy and curly when it starts to grow, and the Bosley does a good job of controlling frizz and making my hair shiny, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>, I was expecting it to be pleasant like so many salon products but this has a strong odor.</li>
      <li>and this is the best so far.</li>
      <li>So far the best of all the products I have tried.</li>
      <li>w. hich is very fine from taking medication, so i decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and has been thinning over the years.  </li>
      <li>Does a great job -- just remember not to use too much and don&#x27;t over condition your hair!  </li>
      <li>My hair has increased growth tremendously since I have started this!!</li>
      <li>But Bosley honestly gave me hope that someday we will see more products like this with a more intensive and comprehensive treatments that will work better for people with greater levels of need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked the smell of each as well; nothing overwhelmingly strong or offensive.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to use and is a nice size for travel.</li>
      <li>I repurchased these in the large size after being happy with the starter pack.</li>
      <li>BUT I am no longer losing huge amounts of hair!</li>
      <li>I took pictures to document that just to make sure and saw no difference.</li>
      <li>And, have seen noticeable results with my hair feeling and looking more healthy.</li>
      <li>Try Nioxin its better.</li>
      <li>ok I have been using Aveda and Prive&#x27; for years... and never had any luck..</li>
      <li>I think it could possibly be more for Caucasian people.</li>
      <li>I think is better) and the leave-in spray.</li>

      <li>I could buy again but that would just put more money in their pocket and not get what I bought this product for.</li>
      <li>but it makes me feel better</li>
      <li>Love the conditioner and the tingling sensation you get to your scalp.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair is short and fine and this is really helping.</li>
    <li> HAven&#x27;t finished using said product yet...so far so good.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is wonderful.  have been using it for a while and my hairdresser has noticed a difference in my hair</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to try in hopes of more hair. Shampoo and conditioner very nice. What hair I have Looks better. I don&#x27;t see any new hair.</li>
    <li> the product did not improve my situation at all.  It made my hair courser. Not really worth it at all.</li>
    <li> I was losing a noticable amount of hair after every shampoo, frankly it was getting scarey.  I have been using all three products daily for over a month now and for the last three days there is almost nothing in my comb!  Maybe two or three hairs at best!  I am thrilled to also report some regrowth that is verified by my licensed beautician daughter!  I will continue buying this!  Just give it some time...</li>
    <li> Very effective hair loss treatment, which I highly recommend from longterm experience. It is easy to apply and has no side effects. Great product!</li>
    <li> from the first week, I saw my hair was less dry, more manageable, and full of body. I have done this for two weeks and I can&#x27;t say I see less hair in my sink, but less in my brush, and my color is holding well, ordered more.</li>
    <li> Works for me . So far the best of all the products I have tried. Less expensive too than other treatment.</li>
    <li> I love the Shampoo and conditioner that felt great on my scalp. However the thickening foam tangled my hair and made it get stuck together on the ends and break off instead of softening. I have considerable breakage from the volumising foam. They need to improve the foam, it feels like buildup on the hair. It does add body but makes it frizzy not soft body. Dissappointed!</li>
    <li> DId not work for my hair at all, in fact my hair came out even more to the point where I have no hair in the front at all now.</li>
    <li> Last summer my hair really started falling out. Between the hormones and heridity, I stood little chance...or so I thought. My daughter told me about the Bosley products and I thought \\&quot;Why not!\\&quot;  Am I ever so happy that I made the right decision! Wow!!! After 4 weeks of use, I went to my hairdresser who immediately told me I had lots of 1\\&quot; hair all over my head. I was so excited! I had felt \\&quot;whiskers\\&quot; earlier in the month but my hairdresser confirmed it...real hair GROWTH! I have been a faithful user ever since.</li>
    <li> While I do not buy my product from Amazon but get it from my stylist I thought I would comment. This product is highly concentrated and one does not need much to shampoo, condition and use the thickener mousse (I call it mousse). When one buys from a salon you are instructed on how much and how to use. I have short hair, not much above my ears. When using one should wet the hair, apply a small amount to the palm of your hand (I use a dime-nickle sized amount), rub your hands together and then apply to your hair and lather it for 1 minute. Rinse well and use the same amount of conditioner and let stay in on your wet hair for 5 minutes while you finish the rest of your shower, rinse thoroughly. After towel drying your hair then you apply the mousse. I use 2 pumps of the product, rub my palms together and then apply to my hair. I air dry my hair. I have never felt a tacky, limp, icky sensation to my dry hair. I have very dry hair and skin and have not noticed any additional drying of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that some might be using too much product, might not be rinsing well etc. All salon products are highly concentrated and one does not need much to clean and condition the hair. The products that you buy in the general stores to wash your hair are mostly water so that is why you need so much to clean your hair.  I (as did others and my stylist) saw results with Bosley in a month&#x27;s time. The hair does not grow instantly and one needs to be patient. Watch right at the front of the scalp as that is where you will notice the new growth. Hang in there and give it time and you should see results. GOOD LUCK!</li>
    <li> Big waste of money.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money does not work. Try Nioxin its better.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and is a nice size for travel. Not sure if it is helping with thinning, but I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
    <li> I only wash my hair twice weekly. Was thinning badly at the forehead and I was very self conscious. In two months I have enough hair growing to cover the hairless areas and the new hair is over an inch long. I am thrilled; feeling a young 66 again!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I received this product on 10/13 and have used every other day without fail. I have not noticed anymore hair than I already had. I could buy again but that would just put more money in their pocket and not get what I bought this product for. I will move on to another product that might do what it says.  I would not recommend this product to buy for re-growing hair or even the appearance of being thicker as neither happened....</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it claims. I love this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and it does thicken your hair.  I was also pleased that it left my hair silky and soft - it did not have any harsh impact (did not make it dry, unmanagement or with any residue).  My hair is medium length and I only needed a very small amount (maybe dime size) of the shampoo and conditioner.  Normally - I shampoo - leave it on while I shave - then rinse - add the conditioner and leave that on while I wash.  This gives about 2-3 minutes for each step before rinsing.  I use the mouse on wet hair and massage it into my scalp.  I didn&#x27;t really feel the cooling/tingling that others have described - but that could be based on your type of skin.  I have been a &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; user for several years and love the product - so going back to washing my hair with shampoo regularly was a bit scary.  I still use WEN - but use it as a leave in conditioner - applying to wet hair - avoiding the scalp.  I also see new hair growth - but can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s just normal growth.  I have not tried the serum yet - may do that next.  My hair is very fine and has been thinning over the years.  The women on my father&#x27;s side tend to lose hair the older they get - many wore wigs - so I&#x27;m trying to start early and hopefully avoid that problem.  So far - I like the product and would recommend it.  The price is very reasonable compared to other similar products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel like straw. It does not help with the growth or thickness, it just changes the texture of my hair to give off a thicker texture which is hard to manage and hard to style.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the advice of my hairdresser as an alternative to the Nioxin system that I&#x27;m using.  I HATE THIS!!!  My hair is thinning on the top by my bangs and was much more noticeable after using this.  The conditioner dried my hair out and made it extremely difficult to brush (I have short hair).  And the foam leaves a film residue on my head that is very noticeable if I go out of the house.  I&#x27;m not sure about growing hair back because after 2 weeks of using it I threw the rest in the trash.  For me, I&#x27;m going back to Nioxin.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this product since may 30th 2015...and im not really sure if I like it. I think it could possibly be more for Caucasian people. It dried my hair. I did see a little tiny bit of &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; hairs coming in in the front of my hair. But I couldn&#x27;t use it as directed due to black people don&#x27;t wash there hair every single day like Caucasian or other races. So every week I used it and it smelled like ment or something. I had to use my other moisturizing shampoo and conditioner with it. So for me it was a waste of money. But at lease I got to try it out :-) hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair that has started to thin.  With this set my hair has become thicker.  I am unsure at this point if it is actually filling in again.  The conditioner has a tingly feeling that grows stronger the longer that is is left on.  A cool tingle.  The downside is that to me it smells like spearmint gum.  My hair is breaking off less and holds a style much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since March 2015 - not one bit of difference.  It tingles, makes you feel like it&#x27;s working, but. . . . . not so much.</li>
    <li> makes my hair greasy and limb. not a fan....my solution is hair fiber, that powder stuff that attaches to your hair, comes in different colors. that does the trick for me... its just an illusion but it makes me feel better</li>
    <li> I tried this set of products for three weeks without seeing any result. The products did not leave my hair as fluffy and full of body as my regular shampoo so I stoppped using it. My sister, however, has had good results with finding new growth. I gave my pack to her. The instruction booklet indicated that this orange pack is for people who have experience definite hair loss and I did not. I was using it in hopes of having thicker hair. The booklet said there is a different pack for that. Try to get more information before ordering.</li>
    <li> Some time ago I have experienced some hair loss. I managed to stop it but did not achieve any regrowth since by using other products. I use Topikk. I only used Bosley product for a week but from the first time I felt that my hair got twice fuller and livelier and I could leave home without Topikk. First time the conditioner gave me a fairly strong but not unpleasant tingling, now the sensation is a bit weaker. I also bought hair regrowth treatment and I hope to report on more results in 3-4 months. For now I am a believer because I can&#x27;t remember such positive change in response to any other products, and I wasted enough money on the expensive ones. Even with the worst case scenario such as no regrowth at all I&#x27;d certainly be upset but I won&#x27;t regret using this product. I have to use some shampoo:-) anyway and this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair thinning and for a woman that is bad.  I got this to see how it would work and so far it seems to be doing fine</li>
    <li> Great product have used it for two years now, and love it.  Even my husband sees the difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair looks thicker and feels healthy. Smells great.</li>
    <li> very good item good does work</li>
    <li> Hated product made my hair fall out worse, and dried it out</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look thinner anymore takes time to see the difference but my hair looks a bit thinker and u bearly see though my hair</li>
    <li> A friend suggested this product as she has used it for a year and had great  results withn it. I have just  used it a little over a month and  like what I see. Hope to see more good results in months to come.</li>
    <li> This product does seem to do what it advertises- I had to use about three weeks before I really noticed a great difference in texture and volume of hair -- I will buy it again and recommend for women with thinning hair to give it a try .</li>
    <li> The product is great to fatten thinning hair but, will not block or help with shedding of the hair. The scalp may get sensative to sun exposure or irritate your skin so,  be careful if you are sensative to irritants of if you have eczema and using this product. I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> So u purchased this not too long ago and the very first time i washed my hair there was no hair fall out when my hair was still wet. After my hair dried i had some hair fall out but not as much. The only thing is it does leave my hair kinda dry but i dye my hair blonde so my hair is always dry. I would repurchase this again&amp;#62; NExt time i would just buy shampoo alone in the bigger bottle. I hope it stops my hair fall all the way</li>
    <li> These products do really help grow back the hair that you have lost.  I&#x27;ve used it many times.  And every time I&#x27;ve used it, my hair has grown back.</li>
    <li> This was the best shampoo for my hair. I had lost a ton due to an illness. My dermotologist told me to use the shampoo along with Men&#x27;s Rogaine Foam.  I used the foam twice daily and the shampoo  when I needed to shampoo.  What a difference in three months.  I thought I noticed a bunch of 1/2 inch or longer strands popping up throughout my scalp.  It was confirmed at my hairdresser.  The two together are incredible.  So yes this shampoo works.  I had been using scalp treatment for women regularly but had not had the same results.  I would totally recomment this .</li>
    <li> I have purchased more of this product. I&#x27;m not sure it is really doing any thing about my thinning hair. I will continue to use it as I believe time is required to really test a product. I also do a lot of head massage and brushing in conjunction.</li>
    <li> Hoping to see results</li>
    <li> I think I like the shampoo and conditioner, but found the thickening treatment left my hair clumped  together in bunches and kind of gummy.</li>
    <li> This was the first item I tried and loved all the products...Just ordered them in the larger sizes!</li>
    <li> Only used it two days now but definitely improves condition, texture and thickness. I ordered two months worth so we will see if it continues to work so well. I will update.</li>
    <li> After using these products I developed sores all over my scalp and my scalp is now extremely sensitive to the touch.</li>
    <li> Great product! I am a 24 year old male athlete and my hair started thinning on the top recently. This pack noticeably thicken my hair in just a week of using it!</li>
    <li> It seems to be drying out my hair but I do see some new growth, which is nice. Just wish my hair did not look dried out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get results but it&#x27;s a decent shampoo. Not great for results though.</li>
    <li> Great works new hair growing</li>
    <li> So far I have been using and my hair definetly looks longer and fuller I like it a lot.Will buy again</li>
    <li> Love it. The smell is not bad, easy to use, and makes hair veal cleaner and healthier. It has slowed down the hair fall out.</li>
    <li> I HAVE THINNING HAIR AND I HAVE BEEN TO THE DOCTOR AND THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  I READ THE REVIEWS FOR THIS PRODUCT, MOST OF IT VERY GOOD.  I SAW A REVIEW THAT SAID IT MADE HER HAIR A LITTLE ON THE DRY SIDE, BUT DECIDED TO TRY ANYWAY.  THIS STUFF IS AWFUL!  IT SMELLS AWFUL, AND LEFT MY HAIR LIKE STRAW (LITERALLY!).  I LOST MORE HAIR WITH JUST ONE WASH AND CONDITION USING THIS PRODUCT (I COULDN&#x27;T GET MY WIDE TOOTH COMB THROUGH MY HAIR FOR NOTHING) THAN I HAD IN A MONTHS TIME.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I am 20 years old and was developing a bald spot! I had terrible dandruff, itchy scalp, frizzy hair, and entire chunks of my scalp became scabs. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;This product did nothing for my bald spot, but it did clean and heal my scalp. As for my hair, it stopped being frizzy and unmanageable and has gained much of its natural curl back.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use the shampoo and conditioner. The foam made the first 2 inches of my hair look oily, and when it dried, it flaked. So ignoble use that once a week when I don&#x27;t plan on seeing anyone till my next shower.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to COMPLETELY rinse both the shampoo and conditioner out of your hair. It will tingle(kinda like mint). Also, if you have long hair, use a pick to comb through it the first time and then a brush. It decreases the normal Brushing hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t itch your head! It does feel itchy and tingles for up to 30 min after you shower, but it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use heavy gel products and hair spray for the first few shampoos until the old product build up is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to my friends for removal of product buildup from crappy, cheap products. I would suggest it for guy friends losing hair, but not girl friends.</li>
    <li> Bosley sucks, get Pura D&#x27;or -  a much better product, your hair will be soft and you will see a difference in growth as well. I do not recommend to have a hair transplant by Bosley either, they ripped me off, they do not mention, you have to have several procedures done in a row, not to mention it puts too much trauma on the scalp, which causes some of your existing hair to fall out and not come back.</li>
    <li> I noticed such an improvement. Your product was recommended by my hair stylist, and was I happy. I hate wigs, and hats.</li>
    <li> On a whim I thought I would check if Amazon offered these products since they are so expensive at the beauty supply.&lt;br /&gt;I was about to resign my self to wearing a wig because my hair had gotten so thin.  From the first use I was amazed at how much body and volume I had.  I have been able to put off wearing a wig for a while longer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for four months and while I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helped me grow more hair it definitely made what I have look like so much more. I will be ordering this again!&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this to a friend and she loved it too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Bosley product for almost a year and it really works, even my hairdresser claims my hair is thicker. My hair is also in great condition. I have recommended this to friends with the same results and one friends hairdresser has even ordered it for his salon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for nearly a year and it is wonderful. It does work... I went on the net to find another source besides the beauty shop.  I found this seller and he offered just what I was looking for. Great price and fast shipping....</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to actually help with my psoriasis but it did!  I will only use this from now on!</li>
    <li> My hair has increased growth tremendously since I have started this!!</li>
    <li> Just started to use and feel it&#x27;s promising  All the ingredients are ones that are good for hair and scalp and I like the way my hair feels and looks</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and was recommended this by my salon. I tried it for a few months and really didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I suppose it may take a few months but I thought I should&#x27;ve noticed some improvement in that time.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much. Your sale arrived just as promised. A+</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month (Per instructions) and I do not see a difference in the growth of my hair.</li>
    <li> Bosley is a very good product.  The Revive Starter Pack consists of three main sections of the hair treatment; and it is easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> A hairdresser recommended this product because it was working for her friend. In desperation, I tried it but after one month use I can&#x27;t see any new growth at all. It seems to frizz my hair and does not detangle it at all. I also don&#x27;t like the scent, I was expecting it to be pleasant like so many salon products but this has a strong odor. The conditioner smells like peppermint and tingles my scalp which isn&#x27;t unpleasant. It&#x27;s disappointing that it doesn&#x27;t even detangle or make my hair silky or hold its natural curl, just makes it fuzzy. I guess that&#x27;s how it gives volume. I thought with the name Bosley it would work for me. I&#x27;m very thin on top and desperate to find a solution. I&#x27;ll have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> I got this because my hair started to appear thinner. The reviews were pretty good so I figured it was a good buy. After a month I not only hated the texture and smell of my hair but I noticed clumps of hair falling out each time I used it. After realizing it could be from the product I stopped, my hair loss stopped also. I went to a stylist and she gave me a good shampoo and conditioner product to try and now I can see hair growing back.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week. Although it is too early for new growth the volume/ body has increased by 2x. Smells good feels good not drying...</li>
    <li> gave as a gift to my daughter, she said it really helped her hair</li>
    <li> Great seller, shipped fast, product just as expected. Perfect shape. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was experiencing hair loss due to the birth control method I was using (20-30% of my hair according to my hair dresser). I no longer use that method and needed something to stop the hair loss quickly. I tried Nioxin in the past and didn&#x27;t like the chemical smell. I have been pleasantly surprised with Bosley. I&#x27;m happy to report that it wasn&#x27;t long before I began to see lots of new hair growth. I recommend this product and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  I had major post-partum hair loss after having my boys and these products have helped slow it down significantly.  I love the color-treated products, too because they keep my hair moisturized and soft.  I was so excited to find this on Amazon (I used to buy it at my salon for much more).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair loss sufferer with a receding hairline, the classic widows peak. I&#x27;ve been losing hair for a few years, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many hair care products designed to help nourish and restore your hair. I&#x27;ve met with either weak results or just decent results only to switch and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I came across Bosley products, just within a week or so of using this comprehensive treatment system. For the first time, people are beginning to notice an actual physical difference in my hair, and I&#x27;m noticing my hair is getting much thicker, and the thinning isn&#x27;t so obvious. I&#x27;m even beginning to see little buds of hair. Yes, I&#x27;m serious. I even spoke with some people I worked with who have used Bosley products and agree they are probably one of the best out there on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted im using this in combination with other Bosley products like the Hair Vitality supplement and the volumizing thickening &amp; nourishing leave-in spray, as well as Rogain foam. But, this hair system is working, and continuing to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However. You must use this product every day, if not at least once every other day. And you have to follow the instructions to let the system work its magic. I&#x27;ll break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Conditioner; It has to be lathered and left to sit on your scalp in the thinning area for at least one minute and you can go a little over if you want to be safe. But massage gently into your scalp for at least that minute to get the full benefit of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Shampoo; Once you rinse your hair of the conditioner, you have to let the shampoo soak into your thinning areas for at least 5 minutes. I suggest a timer, it really needs to soak in, this is how you begin to block the DHT, just let it work its magic and gently massage for a minute, then let the rest of the time pass so it can soak in. Then rinse completely after your timer goes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Thickening Foam; Dry your hair off after your shower and pump just one palm size helping of foam, don&#x27;t overdo this. Just apply to your thin areas as you did the conditioner and shampoo and massage it into your scalp, and let your hair dry naturally, don&#x27;t use a hair dryer or you might evaporate the foam away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be a daily or every other day process, you can&#x27;t let up on it. If you have weak hair and thin hair, I think Bosley is the way to go. I&#x27;ve used other hair products before for thinning hair, there&#x27;s nothing quite like Bosley that I&#x27;ve come across before. It&#x27;s just got the strength and oomph that I was missing. I really suggest combining this hair system with the dietary supplement, either Rogain foam or the Bosley version of Rogain(which I think is better) and the leave-in spray. You have to treat both the inside and the outside of your body and scalp to block off or reduce the formation of DHT, which is the primary cause of hair loss and thinning. As I&#x27;ve learned, just one treatment isn&#x27;t enough on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have no doubt that using this for at least 30 days, you will begin to see results. Granted, every person is different and no results are typical, and everybody reacts differently to different products. But just a little over a week and a half, I&#x27;m seeing results already, and I can&#x27;t wait to see where I&#x27;m at in 30 days and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say give it a try, if nothing else has worked, I recommend this or Nioxin. Other commercial hair products that claim to be DHT blockers or help nourish fine or thin hair just aren&#x27;t specialized enough to really make a dent against the formation of DHT and prevention, hence why think a lot of people with hair loss get discouraged, I know I have. But Bosley honestly gave me hope that someday we will see more products like this with a more intensive and comprehensive treatments that will work better for people with greater levels of need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I highly suggest it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to learn you had to use this product EVERYDAY.  I am going to do exactly like it says and will report back then.  I have used it 2 weeks with NO DIFFERENCE,  but --I was not using it everyday.  I like the shampoo and conditioner, but the thickening agent leaves my hair looking and feeling gummy and oily.  Will check back in after using everyday.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS and my hair loss is at the crown, around the bangs area. I can&#x27;t part my hair in the middle because of this and have tried to cover it up with my existing hair which is thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the products the 30-days it requires per packaging. At first I thought it was possibly working by adding volume but did NOT grow any new hair. I took pictures to document that just to make sure and saw no difference. Eventually it just made my hair dry and knotted. When I went back to my old products I immediately saw the difference, the knots went away, my roots felt less limp, and even though I wasn&#x27;t growing hair at least it wasn&#x27;t make it look worst like the Bosley products did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone&#x27;s curious about what I use, I start with the John Frieda full repair full body shampoo (I dye my hair and use heating products so this helps with that without making my hair limp), I use the Pantene Color Volume conditioner (this helped with the knots), and then I use either Big Sex Hair root boost and/or Bamboo volume moouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to grow back the hair I lost but this product didn&#x27;t do it for me. It didn&#x27;t make things worst and I am thankful for that, but I won&#x27;t be spending the money to try again.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few months now.  There has been a little improvement, but not like some of the other reviewers.</li>
    <li> I recently starting using this and saw thickening immediately!  By immediately, I mean after the first shampoo. On the first shampoo, I noticed my scalp felt like it burned..like a cold burn, so I rinsed and rinsed, used the conditioner but not the treatment since it&#x27;s a leave in I was worried about the burning. I saw immediately after drying that you could barely see any scalp shining through. After the second shampoo I decided to try the treatment too and am glad I did.  This total package is just amazing. Today is the 3rd day of using and even my husband has asked me how I thickened my hair! My hair isn&#x27;t separating or showing scalp and I am so excited when I look in the mirror!  I&#x27;ve finally found a miracle!  BTW, this doesn&#x27;t burn anymore...I think it may have been the menthol in the product. Try this, you will love it!</li>
    <li> It did seem to keep the hair l still have from falling out but I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth.</li>
    <li> nice starter to try product</li>
    <li> I was recommended to these products by my hairdresser.  So far I have found them excellent, hair is shiny and full and I have noticed less hair fall..it seems to be doing what it says on the tin!!</li>
    <li> Tremendous improve in my hair growth and thickness also texture. Thank you</li>
    <li> It works great.  My hair has improved a lot since I started using it!  I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Just tried these - the product was recommended by my acupuncturist for hair loss (due to stress).  All three products produce a tingling sensation, sort of like putting Ben-gay on your head.  Make sure you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  The sensation gets more intense the longer you leave it on.  (It is similar in feeling to the Nioxin products if you&#x27;ve tried those).  I&#x27;ve only used it twice, so I don&#x27;t know if it works yet, so only 4 stars for now.  But, my hair gets really frizzy and curly when it starts to grow, and the Bosley does a good job of controlling frizz and making my hair shiny, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised that this works. I don&#x27;t see new growth after a month but I notice a lot less hair loss . It does make my hair dry but it feels fuller. I&#x27;d definitely buy again. Only issue is that I have very long hair &amp; used up the shampoo &amp; conditioner fast. Bottles are too small</li>
    <li> After using it for 6 mo., I hair was in shape. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all, It has a really strong antiseptic smell, like vicks nasal spray. I could cope with that If I saw an Improvement, but I&#x27;ve used It all and... nothing. I suppose you may have to use It for ever to see any thing different, but It&#x27;s just not for me. Pricey too.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> It works.  I can see new hair growth.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> Had to watch where I put the foam cause some of it dripped and I did not wipe it off quickly enough from my forehead and a couple of days later I had a couple of dark hairs growing on my forehead......it tends to make my hair very dry and brittle after extended use.....so I just use it once a week.....but I do think it works.....especially the foam.....</li>
    <li> Tried this product for the 30 days allowed and it did NOTHING to help with my thinning hair. I really had high hopes based on the advertising and the customer reviews but was extremely disappointed.  I am a female over 50 and have within the last year noticed my hair thinning.  So, in an attempt to stop this I purchased this product.  I returned it per the money back guarantee and of course received my money less the return postage.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if my hair is longer because of it but definitely thinker/more volume at the roots after using whole kit. Surprisingly luxurious, rich shampoo, like a nice salon shampoo, smells good, so it&#x27;s kind of invigorating. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Did not add any hair or make fuller</li>
    <li> I brought product for my husband but trying to get him to use it is the hard part. The few times he did, it made his hair feel healthy and styling it was much easier.  I would recommend it if you have uncontrollable hair because it is good for that. I am still waiting to see a change in the thinning part.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for your hair and the price was fair.  I will get it again when I need it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping. I like the tingle feeling the conditioner produces.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews on this product.  It only works well on oily hair.  It gives my hair fullness, body, stays great for days which no other shampoo was ever able to do.  Definitely not meant for dry hair...</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. I have thicker, fuller hair now.</li>
    <li> The starter kit has the shampoo and conditioner which is what I have been using.  I like the BOS Revive, it really helps keep my hair in place.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and mousse definitely made my hair look fuller and thicker,  better than any other hair thickening product I have tried.  Some of the things i have tried are thickening mousse, root lifters, powders, even dry shampoos. So much money wasted!! I also like that the mousse does not leave a white film in my hair. Since my hair is dark brown this is a big plus for me!! I use the shampoo about 2 to 3 times a week, the shampoo does kinda dry out your hair so you can go longer between shampoos. I also like to use a more moisturizing shampoo on some days since it does this. I don&#x27;t think this product has helped me to regrow my hair, it may be too soon to tell. So far vitamins are the only thing I have had success with regrowing hair. Plain old prenatal vitamins and Nuhair dht blocker vits work the best for me. Since im not always consistent with vitamins this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> Had to stop using, my hair got so dried out couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. Might work for others but not for me.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell of this product!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help!! Didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Waste of money</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. My hair thickened up in 2-3 weeks. Very impressive. This is my second time purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Very good seller and received promptly. I really like the products....will continue to use every day!  Thanks....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a year now.  Not really all that sure it&#x27;s helping regenerate any new hair but I continue to use the product just because I like how it makes my hair feel really clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great price</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t grown any hair yet.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair more body and seems to fill in the thinning places.  I use the foam just in the front where my hair is badly thinning and I use it only at bedtime.  The shampoo and conditioner makes my hair healthier and lasts a long time because I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day.  I am 73.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing shampoo and products...I liked the smell of each as well; nothing overwhelmingly strong or offensive. Used for several months at my stylist&#x27;s suggestion. ? if any significant results, however.</li>
    <li> I used this three step program with &amp;#34;Guaranteed Results&amp;#34; and pretty much a month later - nothing. Going to try Nioxen.</li>
    <li> My hair has grown 2 1/2 inches in 2 months! And my color looks great! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It made my scalp itch and break out in some places, so I quit using it.  Not for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> i saw improvements after the first week of use. i would recommend this product to everyone i know that has a hair loss problem</li>
    <li> This does add a lot of volume. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it does not leave my hair feeling soft. While rinsing, it feels a lot like brillo pad - not a good feeling. I solved this by using Marrakesh Oil Hair Styling Elixer before combing out, and before putting on the Volumizing treatment. Hair feels super soft and is so full now. Gave it a 4 instead of 5 because of way my hair feels without additional products (the oil). Really happy with the volume though.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I have not used the serum yet.  I have very thin hair and when I use the shampoo I feel like the volume has doubled.</li>
    <li> This product line has stopped my hair from being stringy with fly aways and changed it to look voluminous and flowing.  Chlorininated water, perming, and coloring have damaged my hair to point where I was forced to cut several inches off.  This product line has repaired further damage and my hair has grown back to its longest length possible.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by a beauty operator friend of mine for hair loss and thinning.  I can get a much better price through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product makes my scalp feel.  And, have seen noticeable results with my hair feeling and looking more healthy.</li>
    <li> Good but dries out my scalp.</li>
    <li> Okay, didn&#x27;t work as I expected and dried the rest of my hair out.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel sticky!</li>
    <li> Review by Tom&#x27;s wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this starter kit for about 6 weeks. Some other reviewers had said they seem to have new hair growth. At the moment I can not say I have any new hair growth. However, I must say the hair fallout seems LESS which is of course, a good thing!! At first, I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the volumizing &amp; thickening mousse. The key is to use very little. When I finish the starter kit, I will purchase the full sizes of the shampoo &amp; conditioner. Not sure about the mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are concerned about hair loss...I highly suggest giving this product a try!! What do you have to lose? No pun intended...ha!ha!</li>
    <li> I get these kits for my hair clients with thinning hair for their home use and it definitely has helped their hair to feel and look thicker!</li>
    <li> this product has saved my hair quite a few times over the last several years, due to hormones my hair has fallen out at times, I never know when it will happen but thank goodness for this product. stops the falling out and gets it growing again</li>
    <li> Years of medication makes my hair/scalp go through periods where it feels especially lifeless and and heavy with chemicals. This helped snap it back to a healthier state. I like the shampoo and conditioner, but found there is no way I can use the Thickening Treatment during the day. It weights my hair down with iciness, leaving it limp and straw-like. I put it on only at night.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 1 week now and I don&#x27;t feel any difference. Actually, if anything, my hair may be a little coarser. I will give it a few more days and if nothing I will go back to Pantene shampoo etc. My hair is thinning on top due to heredity and age. I guess nothing can really help that, just thought I would give it a try.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed. All it did was really dry out my hair. It didn&#x27;t make it any fuller ,definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> So far the product seems to be working well.  My hair looks very nice and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was thinning somewhat on top.  Feels fuller.  I have been using Bosley not quite a month.</li>
    <li> Nothing!!!!  I was expecting it to at least stop some of the hair I was losing but nothing. Waste of money for me hope it works for someone else.</li>
    <li> One day I took a picture of my back head after I curled my hair and I noticed some bald spots on my head. I knew I was losing hair but I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad until I saw the picture. I started to notice it more at work on the sides of my head. So I knew I had to do something because I was starting to feel embarassed that people were noticing it. I remember I used Nioxin a few years back. But I found out that they changed their ingredients. Then I came across Bosley. I&#x27;ve never tried it before so I thought I give it a try before I go back to Nioxon. So far I&#x27;ve been using Bosley for almost a month now and it&#x27;s not too bad. I like how it gives my scalp that clean and tingly feeling. It feels like my head is able to breathe after all of that oil has been washed off. I still lose some hair strands in the shower so thats why I only give it a 4 star. But when I&#x27;m brushing my hair, not alot of hair comes out like before, so it&#x27;s a start. Like I said it&#x27;s only been almost a month so I will give it some time to work it&#x27;s magic. So far I like how it makes my scalp feels and how it really cleans my hair. Some reviews say that it dries out there hair and doesn&#x27;t give it that soft feeling. But I&#x27;m okay with it. I understand why the shampoo/conditioner would be a bit dry to the hair. Just my theory, but if the shampoo/conditioner made the hair soft, then it&#x27;s more likely to make the hair greasier faster and lose it&#x27;s volume. The trick to keeping your hair soft and shiny without using other products - in the last minute of your shower run your hair through some cold water. It will help lock in the moisture and keep your hair shiny naturally. Its worked for me. I will have to order me another set once I&#x27;m done with the first one. I recommend it for anyone who has oily and thin hair.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! I had really thin to almost no edges prior to using this product. After using this product, my edges have almost completely grown back in. My hair is thicker and fuller. This product is priceless!</li>
    <li> The product makes my hair feel and look fuller.</li>
    <li> I needed something to grow back my hair w. hich is very fine from taking medication, so i decided to give this a try. IT really works very well, makes my hair shine, which was so very dull and straw like. Will certainly continue on using this product, and i can feel fuzz growing from the scalp. Very good indeed.</li>
    <li> The Bosley product I started using seems to already be working. I love the mint smell and it feels invigorating. I notice that my hair appears thicker and new hair growing in front already. . .</li>
    <li> I used this for 2-3 months, no difference in my hair and not really worth the cost, no shampoo will&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; hair.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, and a lot of it... but it&#x27;s thin.  I was hoping this product would help thicken my hair but... nothing changed.  I followed all the directions and did it for about 2 months... nothin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner made my hair fuller and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The scalp leave in is nice since it isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure but there may be some visible new growth. It will take a few months to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;Even if there is no considerable new growth I like the shampoo and conditioner enough to buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it.. It made my hair feel weighed down. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference so I asked for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry. I am trying something else..</li>
    <li> I feel that my hair looks and feels fuller.  Like the product very much.</li>
    <li> My thinning areas are beginning to show signs of improvement after six months of using the products. My hairdresser recommended this product and she noted some improvement.</li>
    <li> ok I have been using Aveda and Prive&#x27; for years... and never had any luck.. I have thin hair... and a lot of it... and was feeling as though it were all falling out.. I even considered getting the Wen products.. but i tried this after my hair stylist told me it would work... and it does! My hair no longer is thin, but feels thick and sometimes WAY TOO THICK.. I could have NJ BIG HAIR with this product. If you dont like it, send it back.. but you won&#x27;t.. I promise.. I am hooed on it!</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping with my thinning hair, but it is very drying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner about a year and LOVE it - it definitely makes my thin hair thick and shiny.  I realized there was shampoo and a leave-in treatment, so I thought I&#x27;d try them too.  The shampoo&#x27;s OK -- I don&#x27;t notice a difference from other shampoos I use in conjunction with the conditioner.  BEWARE THE LEAVE IN TREATMENT, MY DYED-HAIRED FRIENDS -- I used this concoction ONCE, just at the front where my hair is thinnest and it COMPLETELY STRIPPED THE DYE OFF MY ROOTS (please note that this set is meant to be specifically formulated for color-treated hair).  I&#x27;m throwing that bottle away, as I don&#x27;t really want to return the whole set, and this was just an experiment anyway.  Lesson:  If you don&#x27;t want to go have your roots touched up right away, leave off the leave in treatment.</li>
    <li> I used this several times but it made my hair dull and limp.  Decided not to use it anymore.  I don&#x27;t reommend it.</li>
    <li> Really worked  I had to be careful  began to grow further down my forehead  I was so surprised it worked!</li>
    <li> These products work well to help my thinning hear look and feel fuller. I find them helpful  in slowing hair loss.  n</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times now and it seems to give my fine, thin hair some body.</li>
    <li> Waiting to see if it actually works.  It does make your hair soft, shampoo and treatment both smell suprisingly pleasant, the conditioner smells strongly eucalyptus-ish.</li>
    <li> I saw no change and it also seemed like the bottles weren&#x27;t filled to capacity with shampoo and conditioner. I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I am always a bit of a skeptic, but I figured for the price this product was worth trying, so I gave it a shot.  First off it was larger than I thought, and I have been using it for about a week and already notice my hair being thicker.  I am also seeing MUCH less on the brush.  I think if you have been considering this product, give it a chance, you might just be pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since my hairdresser recommended it about a month ago.  I won&#x27;t say I have a mop of thick hair, but it is definitely looking better.  I will know more in another month or two, but this has definitely stopped the loss and may even be restoring some hair growth.</li>
    <li> Didnt work for me.... but may work for others.</li>
    <li> I like the products and the combo pack was a good way to try out all 3 products.</li>
    <li> Received order as promised</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I&#x27;m not sure that it helps regrow hair, but I have not lost anymore, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Used this once and it left my hair a mess. My hair was tangled. My hair was flat. Greasy. And it was just not to my liking at all. It left my hair dull. went back to my other shampoo. And my hair is fuller. And shines now. This stuff will ruin your hair.</li>
    <li> Think this would def work in the long run but I couldn&#x27;t get past the rough straw feeling it gave my hair , also made it full looking. I like a natural soft and shiny feel to my hair.</li>
    <li> Does a great job -- just remember not to use too much and don&#x27;t over condition your hair!  Texturizer really works too.</li>
    <li> I have seen great results after a few uses.  I was skeptical when I read the some other positive results but I can attest I have had good luck.  I have had thinning hair due to thyroid cancer for years.  When I use this shampoo my hair looks fuller by the scalp.  I am not saying you will have Beyonce hair but it will help those in need! good luck!</li>
    <li> this set leaves your hair feeling silky, smooth, and light. I don&#x27;t know how I would compare it to other products yet, as I have only used it once. If you&#x27;re going for more volume, the volumizer is awesome</li>
    <li> love the shampoo I think I see results but to soon to say.  Love the conditioner and the tingling sensation you get to your scalp.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed regrowth of any hair BUT I am no longer losing huge amounts of hair! Prior to using this, I had to clear the shower drain after each shower, and use a hand vac in the bathroom after blow drying my hair due to all the hair on the floor. Loss of hair has DEFINITELY slowed down! Not crazy about the scent (not a fan of anything menthol or herbal), but I use a nice smelling mousse, so nobody else notices the product smell. I repurchased these in the large size after being happy with the starter pack.</li>
    <li> I have had very thinning hair (and loss!!) since being diagnosed with hyper thyroidism/Graves Disease.  Every shower resulted in a drain full of hair.  A friend recommended Bosley to me. (Her hair thinned after chemo) It takes about 8 weeks before you see noticeable change, but there was less hair in the drain after about 4 weeks.  I now see new hair growth (as does my hair stylist.)  I am hoping to see it continue, with my hair getting thicker as time goes on. Definitely need to be patient!</li>
    <li> I was deeply disappointed in this product. It is from Bosley, famous for hair products and restoration. But, frankly, I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this and any other cheaper shampoo I&#x27;ve used. There is zero difference in my hair and no noticeable difference in my hair thinning after I use the product. Frankly, I hope you listen to me so you don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I notice less hair loss using the Bosley shampoo and conditioner. I will buy it again. My hair is somewhat limp with its use</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  It works as well as advertised.  My hair is visibly thicker in just a month.  I have color-treated hair and it&#x27;s red; which is the most difficult color to maintain.  It does not strip the color at all.  I&#x27;ve tried other products for thinning hair and they&#x27;ve all stripped or dulled the red in my hair.  This one does not at all.</li>
    <li> it does give you a fuller look .. did not use long enough to see if it regrows</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look anf feel fuller. Hair feels good.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any results yet.</li>
    <li> made my hair fall out every time&lt;br /&gt; I used it. made it dry and matted. I stopped using it . waste of money.  Made my hair worse. stopped using it and it stopped comming out.</li>
    <li> I been using it for a month, I do notice my hair is a bit fuller and cleaner or maybe it&#x27;s just growing faster. What ever it is, it&#x27;s better than the regular shampoo and conditioner. I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle or a full set of Fabio hair, but it gets my hair clean. The shampoo gets it clean and just wait until you try the conditioner, it tingles and gives you that fresh feeling! I&#x27;m going to stick with it for a while.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money, time, and hopes.</li>
    <li> My daughter was losing her hair due to stress we bought this hoping it would help.  She developed HORRIBLE sensitivity and worse dandruff due to it.  They REFUSED to refund me the money I spent as we had used it.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  If you use any product and you develop an issue you can return it (makeup etc) wether or not you have used it.  HORRIBLE customer service</li>
    <li> This product really dried out my hair. No shine!</li>
    <li> My dermatoligist recommended that I use a product that contained Saw Palmetto; Bosley seems to fit that requirement.  I liked it well enough to purchase the 1 liter size when I finished up the starter pack.  Not sure the improvement in my hair can be attributed to Bosley since I started taking vitaman supplements at the same time as I started Bosley.  The conditioner does not seem to detangle like other conditioners do, but it also does not leave my hair limp like other conditioners do.  Also product seems to be friendly to color as my color does NOT seem to be fading; however, I am also using another product that prevents fading, so, again, am not sure that I can attribute &#x27;not fading&#x27; to the Bosley product alone.  All in all, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
