      <li>happy shopping everyone</li>
      <li>I loved the packaging but that&#x27;s where my enthusiasm stopped.</li>
      <li>They are extremely easy to use and provide you with a beautifully arched brow every time.</li>
      <li>They should have better quality control!</li>
      <li>Easy to use, try their amazing Dip Brow with these stencils!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them for anyone who would like to have perfect eye brows.</li>
      <li>These work magic to solve this problem.</li>
      <li>These are nice but sadly fit none of my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>The result I got was pretty good</li>
      <li>greatly packaged, highly recommend, easy to use</li>
      <li>it allows you to adjust it to fit your face much better.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the $$, they are super easy to use and seem to be made of good quality material.</li>
      <li>If you like you can watch Anastasia of Beverly Hills on YouTube, there she provides an extremely informative tutorial on how to get the best results using this product.</li>
      <li>Great Product.. love the different sizes</li>
      <li>Never could get that perfect shape down.  </li>
      <li>You should totally get these if you are trying to find a great shape for your eyebrows.</li>
      <li>The stencil works for me, keeps the process simple, looks great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried and tried again to use these, because they weren&#x27;t cheap but to no avail.</li>
      <li>None of the stencils fit my brow.  </li>
      <li>Still worth it though!</li>
      <li>(I read a bazillion Amazon reviews on all of the different stencils available) trying to find a good eyebrow stencil.</li>
      <li>Quick ship, product as specified.  </li>
      <li>The petite arch is really the best everyday one for me--the others are all pretty huge in comparison.</li>
      <li>The nice thing about this stencil is that it is not a single stencil for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line.</li>
      <li>worth $20, though.</li>
      <li>great quality thick plastic too.</li>
      <li>I use the Anastasia brow dual powder and the light and darker color especially help with use of lighter color at beginning of brow and darker color needed for very sparse end of my brows.</li>
      <li>I have no idea who these are supposed to fit - they are so big!</li>
      <li>Very helpful in detailing the arch of the eyebrow.</li>
      <li>u don&#x27;t need to fill in the whole stencil .</li>
      <li>I did SO much research</li>
      <li>The quality of the stencils is decent; the plastic is sturdy enough for re-use and easy to wipe clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My biggest concern after reading most of the reviews was that they would be to big to look natural, BUT there was ONE in this pack that works PREFECT for me.</li>
      <li>I would advise using a dark eyeliner pencil or even a bright eyeshadow and coloring in both brows prior to plucking.  </li>
      <li>As someone with totally blonde eye brows i need a full stencil to help keep them even.</li>
      <li>so many options and with the break in the bow in half</li>
      <li>If you can deal with stencils these actually do a decent job.</li>
      <li>I suggest you read the product description for the various factors involved in selecting the right brow line.</li>
      <li>so I am not a small woman.  </li>
      <li>But I really wish I could just select the size I needed not buy the entire gamut.</li>
      <li>These help immensely in gving my brows a salon look; but can be very tricky to use.  </li>
      <li>They come in enough types/choices to help someone come up with a realistic eyebrow that will work and look natural.</li>
      <li>Hope other have as much success with this product as I do.</li>
      <li>they r way to big for normal eyebrows to be shaped with</li>
      <li>these r ok if u have very big and thick eyebrows.otherways</li>
      <li>The stencils were way too big to even look some what natural.</li>
      <li>The price is good, but still disappointing if none of the stencil shapes work.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll look a little like Burt on Sesame Street but at least you can make sure you&#x27;ll have even brows.  </li>

<li> I had tried one other brand that was so cheaply made they couldn&#x27;t even be used, but I&#x27;ve since seen other brands that would probably work just as well as Anastasia for half the price.</li>
<li> I have what have become very thin and mostly blond eyebrows over last 10 years</li>
<li> Too long.</li>
<li> I am pretty terrible at filling in my own eyebrows, and this takes the guesswork out of it.</li>
<li> They are also made big as other reviewers have commented on.  </li>
<li> too thick and high price</li>
<li> The other stencils are to big for my small facial frame.</li>
<li> A waste of $20.00 for me, personally.</li>
<li> As I have aged, my eyesight has declined.</li>
<li> and I can be so hard sometimes to get them to look the same.</li>
<li> and I feel that $20 was a little overpriced for one stencil.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had slightly uneven, lackluster brows.  </li>
<li> The brow shapes are all too round.</li>
<li> A little disappointed, they are all same shape different widths.</li>
<li> Even the smallest stencil is a little too thick for me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 5 footish and small framed.  </li>
<li> but for me these are a little difficult to use.</li>
<li> Was so disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> Either I was trying to use these wrong, or these are horrible.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <li> These are nice but sadly fit none of my eyebrows. Too long. A waste of $20.00 for me, personally.</li>
    <li> these r ok if u have very big and thick eyebrows.otherways they r way to big for normal eyebrows to be shaped with</li>
    <li> I like the stencils themselves, however, I do wish they came in just the one that you needed. I have no need for 4 out of the 5 that came in the kit and I feel that $20 was a little overpriced for one stencil.</li>
    <li> greatly packaged, highly recommend, easy to use</li>
    <li> I did SO much research (I read a bazillion Amazon reviews on all of the different stencils available) trying to find a good eyebrow stencil. I have what have become very thin and mostly blond eyebrows over last 10 years and I have to shade them in EVERY morning and I can be so hard sometimes to get them to look the same. My biggest concern after reading most of the reviews was that they would be to big to look natural, BUT there was ONE in this pack that works PREFECT for me. Totally worth the $$, they are super easy to use and seem to be made of good quality material. SO HAPPY with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The brow shapes are all too round. Too cookie cutter. None of the five stencils were usable for me. The price is good, but still disappointing if none of the stencil shapes work.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mothers eyebrows which were out of control and they work like a charm! Just color in their part you want to keep &amp; plunk the rest away. You should totally get these if you are trying to find a great shape for your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> too thick and high price</li>
    <li> Only four stars because I only needed one size to replace my damaged one. The stencil works for me, keeps the process simple, looks great. But I really wish I could just select the size I needed not buy the entire gamut.</li>
    <li> The Anastasia Stencils are awesome. I would highly recommend them for anyone who would like to have perfect eye brows.</li>
    <li> If you can deal with stencils these actually do a decent job. They come in enough types/choices to help someone come up with a realistic eyebrow that will work and look natural. I suggest you read the product description for the various factors involved in selecting the right brow line. The result I got was pretty good and I am not an artist. My only advice is to fill in the brow line with short feathery strokes in a color that compliments your brow color. The nice thing about this stencil is that it is not a single stencil for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line. This stencil set costs $ but works.</li>
    <li> Great for determining which shape best flatters your face. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Eyebrows shape your face and can change your appearance in a second, these stencils definitely help you create that frame that you want to achieve. Easy to use, try their amazing Dip Brow with these stencils!</li>
    <li> I do like this product but, I like my brows on the thinner side. Even the smallest stencil is a little too thick for me.</li>
    <li> I am pretty terrible at filling in my own eyebrows, and this takes the guesswork out of it. The petite arch is really the best everyday one for me--the others are all pretty huge in comparison. Still worth it though!</li>
    <li> Purchased this online a couple weeks ago. The quality of the stencils is decent; the plastic is sturdy enough for re-use and easy to wipe clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth $20, though. I had tried one other brand that was so cheaply made they couldn&#x27;t even be used, but I&#x27;ve since seen other brands that would probably work just as well as Anastasia for half the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had slightly uneven, lackluster brows.  Never could get that perfect shape down.  These help immensely in gving my brows a salon look; but can be very tricky to use.  They are also made big as other reviewers have commented on.  I&#x27;m 5 footish and small framed.  The only one that I could even possibly use is the petite.  I would advise using a dark eyeliner pencil or even a bright eyeshadow and coloring in both brows prior to plucking.  You&#x27;ll look a little like Burt on Sesame Street but at least you can make sure you&#x27;ll have even brows.  It&#x27;ll also give you an idea if the shape will work for you.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed, they are all same shape different widths.</li>
    <li> Great idea but for me these are a little difficult to use.</li>
    <li> As someone with totally blonde eye brows i need a full stencil to help keep them even. These are GREAT! so many options and with the break in the bow in half it allows you to adjust it to fit your face much better. great quality thick plastic too.</li>
    <li> Quick ship, product as specified.  Used as a gift, and recipient is happy with product.  Would purchase again from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of women I have overplucked... These work magic to solve this problem. I only needed the smallest one and gave the rest to my friend!</li>
    <li> As I have aged, my eyesight has declined. The petite stencil is perfect in helping me to do a nice even brow. The other stencils are to big for my small facial frame. I use the Anastasia brow dual powder and the light and darker color especially help with use of lighter color at beginning of brow and darker color needed for very sparse end of my brows. Hope other have as much success with this product as I do.</li>
    <li> None of the stencils fit my brow.  Had to try to turn or piece two together.  Did not help me.</li>
    <li> Either I was trying to use these wrong, or these are horrible. I have no idea who these are supposed to fit - they are so big! You would have to have eyebrows like Cara Delevigne to use these.</li>
    <li> Was so disappointed with this product.  Part of the stencil was cut out.  Plus I ordered two, one for a gift and only one was sent!  Not too happy with Anastasia!!  They should have better quality control!</li>
    <li> LOVE these stencils!!!! and all anastasia products!!</li>
    <li> I loved the packaging but that&#x27;s where my enthusiasm stopped. The stencils were way too big to even look some what natural. I&#x27;ve tried and tried again to use these, because they weren&#x27;t cheap but to no avail.</li>
    <li> If you need help creating the perfect brow shape then these stencils are for you. They are extremely easy to use and provide you with a beautifully arched brow every time. If you like you can watch Anastasia of Beverly Hills on YouTube, there she provides an extremely informative tutorial on how to get the best results using this product. Cheers and happy brow shaping!</li>
    <li> These come in a pack of five and I, really, only needed one...I gave the others to friends.  Very helpful in detailing the arch of the eyebrow.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I always use mine . u don&#x27;t need to fill in the whole stencil . just use it as a guide</li>
    <li> Great Product.. love the different sizes&lt;br /&gt;had to practice to make perfect&lt;br /&gt;does the job&lt;br /&gt;would recommend... happy shopping everyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; woman who wears a size 12 so I am not a small woman.  These stencils are just too big.  Even the smallest one.  I was very disappointed.</li>
