<ol>
    <li> It came out too dark...</li>
    <li> I left it on a little too long my first time so it was a bit too dark. The color is perfect now that I leave it on for less than a minute. I use light brown and my hair is blonde.</li>
    <li> This product is much easier to use than other brow color I&#x27;ve used before. You just brush it on and let it sit. It is only one step, not like others I have used that are two steps and much messier. The color seems to last much longer than the other brand.</li>
    <li> I applied this in one minute increments until I got the light brown color I wanted. Had to do approximately 3, one-minute applications to get the shade I wanted, but I have some gray and it&#x27;s harder to dye.  Washed off in between applications. No dying of the skin around which is nice. Lasted about 3 weeks before needing to re-do. Follow other reviewers suggestion that you only use a little bit out of the capsule and save the rest for another time. It only takes a wee bit to do the trick, otherwise you would be wasting the product.</li>
    <li> Works great and is long lasting.  I leave it on about a minute longer than the instructions provide though, otherwise it would be too light.  Much cheaper than having this done in a salon and lasts much longer.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the only true eyebrow tint I&#x27;ve used; overall, I&#x27;m satisfied. In the past when I colored My hair, I always used a bit of the hair dye to tint my eyebrows. However, I no longer color my hair and was only looking for something to help make my light brown/blonde eyebrows more visible. The individual use capsules are very convenient! This is the LIGHT brown in the picture, taken immediately after processing. For more noticeable results I leave it on longer than the indicated time.</li>
    <li> Works great, you dont have to leave on long and it lasts awhile. Plus, its super easy to mix and apply.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for several years and really like it. As we age our eyebrows take on a lighter look and I prefer to keep mine a shade darker. One application lasts a good 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would be easier to use than the regular Godefroy eyebrow tint.  It&#x27;s exactly the same item with less developer and tint capsules, with the inclusion of some wooden sticks,  NOT easier!</li>
    <li> this is the only product i&#x27;ve used on my eyebrows (very lilght blonde) and i like it a lot</li>
    <li> Be careful to not exceed recommended time on brows, as it acts quickly.  White hairs will take some extra time.</li>
    <li> Love this dye! It&#x27;s fast and easy to use. I have to re-dye my eyebrows about every 2-3 weeks, but I have redish hair, so my hair doesn&#x27;t hold color as long as it probably should. Also one capsule can last me about 3 times, so this is a SUPER great value compared to getting them professionally done!</li>
    <li> Works  well and easy to use; it is a bit darker than shade indicated.</li>
    <li> Love it...first time using and applies easy, easy to mix, great results!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not light brown... It&#x27;s actually too dark... It&#x27;s blackish...</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are really light so I apply this onto them and it makes them look fuller and thicker. It lasts probably a week and then wears off. beecareful to only line it with your natural eyebrow or you will look like you sharpied your eyebrows on. If the color is too dark just use more of the developer than powder and it will be a lighter color. Ive used this stuff for years! one box usually lasts me a year</li>
    <li> Works well but way darker, guess I need blonde! Covered gray well. Have been using other well known brands that didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> last about month.  did seem darker than effected</li>
    <li> I love not having to pay $40 to have it done professionally.  I try to do it before going to my &amp;#34;eyebrow lady&amp;#34; so the strays are easily found.  I wish I didn&#x27;t have to apply the medium brown darker to make it last. Don&#x27;t you have a blond color? Otherwise now that my eyebrows are getting &amp;#34;grey&amp;#34;. It a looks more natural and it&#x27;s easier than pencil every day.</li>
    <li> I will not recommend this product to no one, my eye brows are black so I order this product to lighten the the black color to a light brown and it did not color, it made them darker for this price it should have did the job. and this outer box description with 2 women on there when i received it there is 1face on the box this product must be for certain people. good luck not again</li>
    <li> This works great on my blonde eyebrows.  It&#x27;s not too dark but noticeably darker than my blonde eyebrows.  Perfect.</li>
