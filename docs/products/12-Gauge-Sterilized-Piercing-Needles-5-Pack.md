<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very sharp and worked great to repierce my ears. Went threw scare tissue with no problem. Very good product.</li>
    <li> These needles are great. They were all very sharp &amp; perfect.</li>
    <li> The product came exactly as advertised, the only thing that bothered me was the packaging. Some of the needles poked through the little plastic tip they put on it (most likely through shipping), but other than that, I was pleased.</li>
    <li> Got what i ordered , It was fast ,and i got exactly what i wanted . If you are questioning ordering,you will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;It just takes the one time ordering ,and you will be a return customer .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I got my needles 3 days early! :) I bought these so my boyfriend could pierce my belly button, it slid right thru, no problems.</li>
    <li> I have not used them yet, but I just wanted to comment on how fast I got them. It literally took them two days to get here. Extremely happy because I HATE waiting for something that I already spent my money on.</li>
    <li> PLEASE NOTE: I do not advocate or condone self piercing. Please see a professional before piercing yourself. On that note, I have experience and know what I am doing. It has been 2 weeks since I gauged my ears with these needles. Can&#x27;t wait to use the other 3.</li>
    <li> Perfectly sterilized needles. Pierced my belly button with them &amp; have pierced a lip for a friend of mine. Almost pain free cuz they&#x27;re so sharp. Great buy &amp; a steal for this price!</li>
    <li> I received these needles 1 day before the estimate4d arrival time.    They are pretty sharp, i could pierce my bellybutton really easy :]</li>
    <li> They came a lot faster than they were supposed too &amp; they are wonderful quality. Packed seperately &amp; have saftey tube nubs on the tip so I don&#x27;t stab myself while opening them, hah. I definantly reccomend these.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about these. They pierce well, didn&#x27;t contribute to an infected piercing, and were a good price.</li>
    <li> Came in early but very dull. I was very painful trying to get the needle through. They are a good length. But just can&#x27;t get over how dull they were.</li>
    <li> The needles seem to be in fine shape. We were planning to use them for a non-tattoo purpose which required an actual 12 gauge needle (that complied with standard needle gauging sizes). Instead of having an outer diameter of 0.109&amp;#34;, this needle has an outer diameter of 0.079&amp;#34;! So, if you&#x27;re looking for an actual 12 gauge needle, you won&#x27;t find it here.</li>
    <li> Some needles were super sharp and penetrated very easily and others seemed like I was trying to pierce with a McDonald&#x27;s straw.</li>
    <li> It took a bit longer than it was suppose to to get from Florida to California but im still give it 5starts because the needles are really great quality, were very smooth, and hardly felt a it. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I pierced my bottom belly button, top belly button and industrial with these. I love them so much. Go through painlessly, (for it being a piercing). I would definitely recommend these to anyone and a few of my friends who I told them about got them, said nothing but great things. Thank you guys. (:</li>
    <li> sharp needles in sterile package. i used one to lance and drain a Sebaceous cyst and the piercing act was practically painless</li>
    <li> So impressed with how fast they shipped out! I ordered and seriously an hour later they were already on the way and they came in very quickly! They were very good sterile needles and worked exactly what I needed them for and were the correct size. After reading some reviews on here I made sure to see if the needle was sharp and it was! So not bad for the price!</li>
    <li> Worked great for all my needs</li>
    <li> Professional looking and packaged neatly. Seals were properly intact and were sturdy.</li>
    <li> These are really as sharp as was said. Made my septum, tongue, nipple, inverse navel and medusa easier than other needles I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest needles I have used, they do not come any better. If your looking for a good quality product this is it.

    <li> Pierced my lower lip center labret with these (: Worked great. My least painful piercing (and all my other piercings were done by professionals). I was a little concerned because the faom tip came off a couple of the needles and they punctured the autoclave bags.. so they could now be contaminated. But since I got so many for a low price it&#x27;s no big deal and I just wont use those ones. The needles are super super super sharp! I barely touched them to the skin on my lip and it started to bleed a tiny bit.. this makes for an easy and pain free piercing. I&#x27;m very happy (:</li>
    <li> THEY ARE TOP QUALITY BODY PIERCING NEEDLES AND THEY WERE SENT FAST!!</li>

Thanks for the fast shipping I really appreciate it.  Product looks great and it is just like what it looks like in the picture. I know that sometimes things appear bigger in the picture. It was the right gauge and everything too. They got my order right on, no foul ups or anything I will be going to this site again if I have any more need for piercing stuff.</li>

    <li> They did their job perfectly. If you do the piercing fast enough,you can hardly even feel it because these are so sharp. Perfect for home piercings. They come in individually sterilized wrappings and the shipping was very fast. I didn&#x27;t get any infections from using these, but of course you always have to was the piercing after you do it. I also got the 18 and 20 gauge needles and those were great too. The jewelry fits perfectly into the hollow of the needle, which goes all the way through.</li>
    <li> great set and works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Excellent value, product worked perfectly. I performed multiple piercings and all went very well considering the large gauge, and there were no issues afterwards so I believe the quality of the sterilization and packaging was well done. I would definitely buy from this seller again if I have further need.</li>
    <li> came earlier then expected&lt;br /&gt;good quality&lt;br /&gt;i used them for my septum piercing and it was really easy to get it through&lt;br /&gt;pain free.</li>
    <li> The package of the needles which are put separately in small bag is good. The needles are so sharp! Perfect!</li>
