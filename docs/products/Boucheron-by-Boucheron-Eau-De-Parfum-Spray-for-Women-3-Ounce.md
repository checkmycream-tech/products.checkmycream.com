    <li> A friend introduced me to this scent years ago and I fell in love instantly. This has become my evening signature scent. Every year as a treat to myself, I buy a bottle...that&#x27;s to tell you how I consider it.... a treat. Love love love this fragrance. 6 stars!</li>
    <li> Yes the perfume is exactly what I expected and in a reasonable time frame. Will order again when the time comes</li>
    <li> I have had many compliments on this perfume and have used it for several years.  It is a favorite of mine.</li>
    <li> i have used this for 10 years. love you only needuse a little stays on all day . i woukd givr it a 10 if i could.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is a bit too overpowering for my taste. However, there are women who love this scent that is strong, assertive, elegant and classy, but not for me.</li>
    <li> This scent is no longer made by Boucheron so get it now! This is a classic scent that many women love! Men too! Recommend highly!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Meets my expectations. Cannot get it at Macy&#x27;s store have to order it. Price less at Anazon</li>
    <li> I love this perfume I wish they had not stop making it. Bought for my sister in low that also loves it.</li>
    <li> My husband originally purchased this fragrance for me several years ago, and although I have tried others, I keep coming back!  It is very pleasant, not over-powering.  My husband is very sensitive to strong perfumes, and this is one I can wear without making him start sneezing!  I will remain a customer!</li>
    <li> Been wearing this for 22 years! (got it as a gift and fell in love).  I prefer the kind that dabs on, oppose to the spray, but I&#x27;ll take what I can get. Sweet, expensive smell. Unique.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not liking it. The original (this one) is the best.  I don&#x27;t care for the newer off-shoots under the same name, beware of those.</li>
    <li> I received it as a gift and loved it ever since.  That was 3 years ago.  It&#x27;s still my favorite and the only one I wear.  On me it smells good.  Other perfumes don&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell, gives a passionate feeling, I recommend it 100%; besides that lasts a long time perfect smell for special occasions</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years, when I can afford it. Even in a warm climate, it smells wonderful and is  my signature scent. I&#x27;ve tried so many others, but my chemistry makes many smell stinky. This is a rare exception. I&#x27;ve received compliments on it over and over.</li>
    <li> Nothing but compliments (for the merchant AND for me, when wearing it :-).  Arrived promptly and exactly as advertised/pictured.  This is a classic perfume that never goes out of style; one of my top three favorites!</li>
    <li> I read the many reviews about this perfume.  When I received it it smelled for approx 2-3 minutes and then the scent is gone. I applied some more just to be sure and the same thing happened.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a great price! Arrived in a timely manor as I bought it as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> First time trying this...had always heard about it. This was a good purchase and I would recommend this fragrance to everyone.</li>
    <li> I expected it to smell similar to the men&amp;#34;s Boucheron but it does not.  It is extremely strong and too, too sweet.  But in hindsight, some reviews from others do mention how sweet it is.  It smells very close to Estee Lauder&#x27;s Beautiful.</li>
    <li> it arrived as an old, expired perfurme. i know how the perfume is supposed to small. i resolved this issue w your customr service agent by getting a credit</li>
    <li> Very pleased that this came much faster that I had expected. The top doesn&#x27;t fit very well, but the smell is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for over 25 years when my husband brought it back from Europe.  I switch out every now and then but I always come back to Boucheron.  I read somewhere (maybe in a review) that the original scent is being discontinued so I bought one for me and my mother and plan on ordering more.  A classic light scent that never fails to bring compliments.</li>
    <li> Happy with product.  Shipping took a little longer than I had expected but still arrived within the time frame given to me.</li>
    <li> It has a soft aroma and has an excellent fragrance. A perfume for every ocassion. It leaves a lasting impression.</li>
    <li> Fantastic price.. And, I felt comfortable buying it that it was &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34; since it came from Amazon and not a 3rd party selliing thru them.</li>
    <li> I bought a perfume for women 3 oz and gave me a perfume for Men. I do order from Colombia for a virtual box that has restriction costs of perfumes and I came this day, this makes it difficult to make the change. You may like to solve?</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for meeting the quality if a good perfume not found in regular stores.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for over 30 years and love it. It&#x27;s not easy to find everywhere, and this one was a great price and perfect.</li>

    <li> is not the same perfume as in a previous package ,i would no buy it again. seems not as original from boucheron</li>
    <li> Really loved this essence. Packaged beautifully. Priced sensibly. Bought to give as Christmas gift, but desided to keep for myself.</li>
    <li> Wore this for years and then stopped becuase I could not smell it anymore.  Hear it was not going to be produced anymore and wanted it for ole time sake.  This is the original product.  Wonderful scent.  Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I found this scent about 7 years ago and fell in love with it. I can&#x27;t live without it I receive multiple compliments every time I wear it. Can&#x27;t say enough about it I love it!</li>
