      <li>The price seemed too good to be true....</li>
      <li>And the dropper top and the screw on top both leak.</li>
      <li>Love them and they have a safety seal</li>
      <li>You have to poke a hole in the top to get drops....</li>
      <li>More like &amp;#34;oh</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be too confident about the integrity of the lid or</li>
      <li>The dropper top pops off even when it is vertical.</li>
      <li>Overall very happy</li>

      <li>I use castor oil in my eyes and this bottle drops one little drop at a time perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>Just a cheap plastic bottle with a cap.</li>
      <li>We use it to ffed our golden retriever pups and they work perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>Thanks again, Amazon!!</li>
      <li>These were exactly what I was looking for, and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
      <li>Takes forever to arrive and the drip tips don&#x27;t fit anywhere near secure.  </li>
      <li>Exactly the right size I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Mine work fine so far, though I haven&#x27;t used all of them.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re little plastic dropper bottles, good for eye medicine or contact lens re-wetting.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I needed to do.</li>
      <li>Absolute junk!  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Sooo smart for travel.</li>
      <li>Nice little droppers.  </li>
      <li>Nice little bottle.  </li>
      <li>It is more effective than spraying the plant and less harmful to other foliage in the area.</li>
      <li>But the inner drip tip pops halfway off  as soon as you try to fit it over the bottle opening.  </li>
      <li>, here&#x27;s the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>This would also work great for many other random liquids that need to be dispensed 1 drop at a time, but not as large as a medicine dropper.  </li>
      <li>My true review would be nothing short of -5.</li>
      <li>The plastic is very flimsy, which I could live with.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Unless there is a lot of inconsistency in the product from one order to the next (which in itself is a red flag), I suggest avoiding this product and finding something better elsewhere.</li>
      <li>There is no way you could put any pressure to squeeze contents without the tip popping completely off.  </li>
      <li>The tops don&#x27;t screw on right, plus it&#x27;s not really a dropper where you can get individual droplets.</li>
      <li>The lid barely screws on &amp; stays on.</li>
      <li>I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised given the extremely low price.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes after seeing a four star average, but these are garbage.</li>

<li> Shipping very slow too.</li>
<li> I was hoping to use these for tiny glue bottles, but they are worthless for any application.  </li>
<li> Disappointed.  </li>
<li> Awful!</li>
<li> An awful purchase.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The tops don&#x27;t screw on right, plus it&#x27;s not really a dropper where you can get individual droplets. More like &amp;#34;oh, here&#x27;s the whole bottle. Hope you needed it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for, and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Granted these are not the highest quality thing ever made. They do the trick, though. They&#x27;re little plastic dropper bottles, good for eye medicine or contact lens re-wetting. Mine work fine so far, though I haven&#x27;t used all of them. They seem to dispense fine and the caps screw on well.</li>
    <li> Absolute junk!  Takes forever to arrive and the drip tips don&#x27;t fit anywhere near secure.  If something in them I would not bet it will stay in if you turn upside down.  I wish Amazon would have some standards on quality before letting this junk be listed at all.  DO NOT BUY THESE!  Only reason I gave it a star is because it&#x27;s required.  My true review would be nothing short of -5.</li>
    <li> An awful purchase.  The price seemed too good to be true....and it was.  The plastic is very flimsy, which I could live with.  But the inner drip tip pops halfway off  as soon as you try to fit it over the bottle opening.  And it fits over, it is not inserted into the bottle.  Poorly designed and  will not seat securely.  There is no way you could put any pressure to squeeze contents without the tip popping completely off.  I was hoping to use these for tiny glue bottles, but they are worthless for any application.  And not worth of hassle of trying to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation... keep looking.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I take medicine in drops and wanted to have something portable. Unfortunately, there is only a lid and the bottom &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34; portion. You have to poke a hole in the top to get drops....except then there&#x27;s nothing to keep the liquid from escaping. Also, they took forever to arrive. Can&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> It took over a month to get.  It does exactly what I needed to do.</li>
    <li> I use this for cutice removers. I usually buy the big bottles so I transfer it here for easier application. It doesn&#x27;t leak. Good quality!</li>
    <li> Awful! The bottles do not have a hole to squeeze out liquid. Just a cheap plastic bottle with a cap.</li>
    <li> Nice little droppers.  I have not had any problems with them, but, do carry them in a ziplock snack size bag in case they leak….</li>
    <li> These are perfect for travel size makeup that you don&#x27;t want to carry a lot of.</li>
    <li> very good product! I love it!! :-)</li>
    <li> Sooo smart for travel.</li>
    <li> I needed a dropper to distribute some hair dye color corrector and this works great.  This would also work great for many other random liquids that need to be dispensed 1 drop at a time, but not as large as a medicine dropper.  Not only did I get 1, I now have a life supply of 10!  I would consider this a hard to find item that I&#x27;ve never seen in stores, and once again, Amazon does not disappoint and I can always find the most random things on this site.  Thanks again, Amazon!!</li>
    <li> perfect size, leak proof, easy to squeeze, controlled drops and locking mechanism before first use.  Except, one of the 10 caps/covers had a hole in it.  Overall very happy, also quicker shipping than expected.</li>
    <li> Of the 10 bottles in the order, only 8 had a dropper and a cap. The other two are not usable as dropper bottles.    I was contacted by the EF-Cloud and they rectified the error.    We carry the bottle when we garden. When we come upon a wisteria vine or other impossible to uproot plant, we put a drop of RoundUp (glycophosphate) on a newly cut section. It is more effective than spraying the plant and less harmful to other foliage in the area.</li>
    <li> We use it to ffed our golden retriever pups and they work perfectly fine. They&#x27;re so cheap!!!</li>
    <li> Junk.  Would not buy again.  The lid barely screws on &amp; stays on. Disappointed.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. Seem to be just fine and I could find these anywhere else. They are china style made but work fine. Not sure I would fill one up with acid and put it in my front pocket. Not that kind of five stars. Value per dollar.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. The dropper caps were a little hard to find in the bag, but they are there. Works perfectly for eye drops and I use them carry jojoba oil to apply to my nails as my hands are pretty bad since I work in landscaping.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my e-liquids.  I could just never find bottles for my e-liquids that I was happy with (for my travel case).  The few I found at e-liquid supply sites were either pricey, defective, hard to squeeze or too big.  These are perfect!  Everything fits together well and they fill easily.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> They go together just fine but the slightest pressure makes them leak. There is no way to get the cap off without applying some pressure.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Shipping very slow too.</li>
    <li> Love them and they have a safety seal</li>
    <li> Good for testing flavors of ejuice.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes after seeing a four star average, but these are garbage. The screw cap does not adequately seal the contents. Even slight pressure on the closed bottled will cause the contents to leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless there is a lot of inconsistency in the product from one order to the next (which in itself is a red flag), I suggest avoiding this product and finding something better elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Nice little bottle.  Three separate parts for each bottle.  Exactly the right size I was looking for.  I use castor oil in my eyes and this bottle drops one little drop at a time perfectly.  Good price for 10 bottles.  Packaged well and delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Perfect for putting liquid soap in for the first aid kits.</li>
    <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised given the extremely low price.  There is no hole at the top to use as a dropper.  Once you put a hole in it, it will spill any time.  I wouldn&#x27;t be too confident about the integrity of the lid or it not leaking even without a hole.  No deception in the ad.  Just a cheep tiny plastic bottle.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> The dropper top pops off even when it is vertical. And the dropper top and the screw on top both leak.</li>
    <li> great for sample diy e juice mixing superb quality</li>
    <li> The dropper caps are not secure.  Cheaply made.  I tossed these in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, but works perfectly for what I needed.</li>
