      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
      <li>i know, it says oil free</li>
      <li>The product says its oil free</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing special about this product, it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only good thing about the product.</li>
      <li>My eye makeup comes off easily and pretty quickly using this.</li>
      <li>and I am not even halfway through my first 5.5 Fl Oz bottle!</li>
      <li>While this product is very effective and doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes at all, it is extremely oily!</li>
      <li>Left a residue and didn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job actually taking off mascara.</li>
      <li>the only thing i would have liked to know about this product and</li>
      <li>It dries pretty quickly</li>
      <li>I was first concerned about this product when it arrived NOT factory sealed.  </li>

      <li>I have been an avid eye makeup remover user for 10+ years.</li>
      <li>What i do is first</li>
      <li>On the positive side, this product is pretty inexpensive for an eye makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s product does not cause my eyes</li>
      <li>I have used this product purchased at a store as a sample with Clean and Clear oil control cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Clean &amp; Clear Soothing Eye Makeup Remover doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
      <li>dab it on my makeup &amp; it literally leaves such a nice clear face.</li>
      <li>The eye makeup remover I use before, Loreal, is not working good, hard to clean completely.  </li>
      <li>I returned it easily and received my money back but will NEVER buy this online again.  </li>
      <li>It works really efficiently.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this makeup remover!</li>
      <li>haha)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and removes almost all of my eye makeup even the waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>The remover may come very close to my eyes but it doesn&#x27;t sting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for all ages.</li>
      <li>I found Wet and Wow eye makeup remover for a fraction of the cost at a local store and it works well like my original purchase of the Clean and Clear version.</li>
      <li>My eyes and skin are very sensitive</li>
      <li>If you do not have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Th remover is slightly oily though it claims to be oil free, however the texture does help with the makeup removal</li>
      <li>I like other Clean and Clear products but not this one.</li>
      <li>and once you wash your face and dry off with a towel your skin actually feels good rather than dried up with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>that thing removes everything from my face, easily cleans my eyelashes, even they are thick covered with mascara.</li>
      <li>All of the other brands I have tried for oil-free eye makeup remover made my eyes sting so much when I used them.</li>
      <li>It does not leave behind any makeup or residue, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It removes makeup right away - you don&#x27;t have to wipe and wipe and wipe for a minute until your eyes are raw, 2)</li>
      <li>I did feel a little warmth coming from the remover when it went near my eyes, but it was much better compared to the previous stinging I felt when using the other brand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this stuff everyday and you need so little that this bottle will most likely last me another 5 years!</li>
      <li>I have purchased numerous make up removers from different brands such as Almay, Maybelline, Rimmel, and L&#x27;oreal within the past few weeks and none of them are comparable to the Clean and Clear Soothing Eye Makeup Remover!!!</li>

    <li> While this product is very effective and doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes at all, it is extremely oily!</li>
    <li> I use eyeliner gel. The eye makeup remover I use before, Loreal, is not working good, hard to clean completely.  But I bought this product after reading a couple of reviews.  It works really efficiently. It feels like Johnson baby skin oil that I used to use for removing eye makeup before. But this product marks oil-free, and it&#x27;s solely for eye.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover, only wished it carried in stores.</li>
    <li> I have a very hard time finding an eye makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and make them red. Clean &amp; Clear Soothing Eye Makeup Remover doesn&#x27;t at all. Also, it&#x27;s not greasy. You don&#x27;t even have to wash it off after taking the makeup off and it feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing the skin around your eyes. Someone gave me a sample and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the retail stores. I was afraid it was an older product that wasn&#x27;t being made anymore. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This makeup remover had good reviews.  It&#x27;a Ok but not sure if it&#x27;s any better than others I&#x27;ve used.  It feels oily even though it doesn&#x27;t have oil in it.  Could be better I guess.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 6 years and I am not even halfway through my first 5.5 Fl Oz bottle! I use this stuff everyday and you need so little that this bottle will most likely last me another 5 years! Yes, it feels a bit oily but it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and it actually makes your skin feel softer. You don&#x27;t have to scrub at all. Just put a dab on your finger and swipe across your eyes/face and it&#x27;s gone. I highly recommend this product for all ages. It&#x27;s inexpensive and lasts forever!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best makeup removers I&#x27;ve ever used. Works perfectly and does not irritate.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, fully removes my makeup, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The product says its oil free but when I received the item HALF the bottle was this oil substance. It looks so bad that I can&#x27;t even bring myself to even apply it to my face. The smell is nice. It&#x27;s not strong. That&#x27;s the only good thing about the product. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defected bottle or that&#x27;s the way this product is suppose to be. I will not buy this product again. If there was an option to rate this product with no stars that&#x27;s the rate I would give it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased numerous make up removers from different brands such as Almay, Maybelline, Rimmel, and L&#x27;oreal within the past few weeks and none of them are comparable to the Clean and Clear Soothing Eye Makeup Remover!!! I wear black gel liner and kohl waterproof eye liner along my waterline everyday. With the other products, they can&#x27;t take the makeup off completely. There&#x27;s still remnants of my mascara and eye liner left. With the C&amp;C, couple swipes and it&#x27;s all gone! I love this product! ;)</li>
    <li> it removes my makeup but eyes will get oily after using (and have to rinse off with warm water). with the price i got the product i think its a good buy.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing special about this product, it gets the job done. It&#x27;s gentle and removes almost all of my eye makeup even the waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid eye makeup remover user for 10+ years. I&#x27;ve tried all the products, everywhere from $25 to $2 per bottle. I&#x27;ve been using the Mary Kay remover for 3 years or so but recently ran out and didn&#x27;t want to wait for my Mary Kay lady to get it to me. I picked this up at the grocery store last week and cannot believe how it stacks up to its competitors. 1) It removes makeup right away - you don&#x27;t have to wipe and wipe and wipe for a minute until your eyes are raw, 2) It doesn&#x27;t sting - so many products sting the crap out of your face, 3) It&#x27;s not greasy - no residue left behind, 4) THE PRICE - you can&#x27;t beat it for this size bottle!</li>
    <li> All of the other brands I have tried for oil-free eye makeup remover made my eyes sting so much when I used them. Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s product does not cause my eyes any pain- I absolutely love it! My eye makeup comes off easily and pretty quickly using this. It does not leave behind any makeup or residue, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth. Thank goodness for Amazon, because I cannot find this item at stores anymore!</li>
    <li> On the positive side, this product is pretty inexpensive for an eye makeup remover.  It also removed my eye makeup easily without rubbing.  On the negative side, I have very sensitive skin and the area around my eyes stung and remained irritated for a few days.  I tried this product because I had been using Lancome Effacil and hoped to find something less expensive.  If you do not have very sensitive skin this product will probably work for you - it does what it is supposed to do.  I am sticking with Effacil.</li>
    <li> I like other Clean and Clear products but not this one. Left a residue and didn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job actually taking off mascara.</li>
    <li> Okay to take of most makeup, but waterproof mascara is not so easy. I use other stuff now. Avon stuff works pretty good</li>
    <li> I was first concerned about this product when it arrived NOT factory sealed.  It was labeled Oil-free but seemed to have a big glob of oil in it.  I tested a small amount and it did leave an oily residue on my skin which was hard to clean off even with soap.  The instructions were to shake it well which I did.  It turmed cloudy and still oily. I have used this product purchased at a store as a sample with Clean and Clear oil control cleanser.  I loved the sample but cannot find it sold in stores seperately.  This is why I searched online and purchased at Amazon. I returned it easily and received my money back but will NEVER buy this online again.  I found Wet and Wow eye makeup remover for a fraction of the cost at a local store and it works well like my original purchase of the Clean and Clear version.</li>
    <li> This works great but my only issue would be that it feels oily.  Which it may be oil free but whatever substance it has in it, looks like oil and feels like oil.  It dries pretty quickly but I just don&#x27;t like the oily feeling at all and it may just be a moisturizer. But I have lotion for that.  I gave it 4 stars because it works good, I just don&#x27;t like the oily feeling at all.</li>
    <li> This makeup and mascara remover works well.  Does not sting or leave any redness.  Goes on and rinses off very easily.</li>
    <li> This make-up remover is so wonderful! i put it on a cotton swab &amp; walla dab it on my makeup &amp; it literally leaves such a nice clear face. the only thing i would have liked to know about this product and what i dont partcularily like about it, is that it is oily! yes i know, it says oil free but after you use it your skin is definitally oily. What i do is first, you have to shake the bottle because otherwise i dont know it just doesnt work, so ya shake the bottle and then after you are done applying it your skin will feel oily (i already said that haha) so just take a warm wash cloth and wipe it over your face. i do recomend this product to anyone who wears eye makeup because it literally takes it all off! :)</li>
    <li> THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for removing eyeliner, eye shadow and mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use cotton rounds and it takes off every bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in October. It is June and I am just now reordering a bottle, so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE TRICKY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it says it doesn&#x27;t have oil in it, it still feels a little oily.  I think it might just be the aloe though.</li>
    <li> So far, the best make up remover ever :) little pricey but it&#x27;s worth it :) that thing removes everything from my face, easily cleans my eyelashes, even they are thick covered with mascara.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new eye makeup remover because the one I previously used had a sting to it. I looked at the reviews for this product and decided to give it a go since many people claimed that it did not sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for myself. The remover did not cause any sot of sting at all! I did feel a little warmth coming from the remover when it went near my eyes, but it was much better compared to the previous stinging I felt when using the other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid in the bottle will separate into two layers if you let it sit, so be sure to shake it up good. Th remover is slightly oily though it claims to be oil free, however the texture does help with the makeup removal and once you wash your face and dry off with a towel your skin actually feels good rather than dried up with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to remove my eyeliner very easily and if I missed a spot with cotton pads I can even go back to those spots with a Q-tip dipped in the remover and remove it with that. The remover may come very close to my eyes but it doesn&#x27;t sting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this makeup remover!</li>
    <li> My eyes and skin are very sensitive and I&#x27;d been looking for a product like this for a long time.  I will be ordering more soon as I have almost run out.</li>
