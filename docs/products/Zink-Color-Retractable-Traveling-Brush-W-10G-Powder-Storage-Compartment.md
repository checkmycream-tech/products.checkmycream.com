      <li>I ended up splurging on a good one.</li>
      <li>I filled mine with baby powder and it dispenses perfectly.</li>
      <li>Good for travel</li>
      <li>Good price</li>
      <li>I had one of these years ago, and haven&#x27;t been able to find one since it broke!</li>
      <li>Glitter and setting powder come out nicely.</li>
      <li>The retractable bristle cover makes the brush stay nice.</li>
      <li>and they both came already cracked in more than one place despite good packaging in the mail.</li>
      <li>The brush itself is not the greatest for makeup but is good backup for loose powder touch-up.</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I think it would be best used for powder sunscreen, which is what I bought it for initially.</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>Would love suggestions.</li>
      <li>It is the fastest, cleanest, most convenient way I&#x27;ve found to apply corn starch to all the nooks and crannies of a wiggly baby!&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so simple to throw in my bag an touch up any time of day, great for bronzer, mineral foundation or whatever your favorite powder is!</li>
      <li>For the price, this is a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>It came quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>This brush is refillable, and easy to transport, which I love.</li>
      <li>I made my own mineral sunscreen (cheap and easy folks) and want to have it in these for easy use.</li>
      <li>Took this product (filled with zinc powdered (not micronized) sunscreen) with me to the beach to use on my very light skinned toddler.</li>
      <li>it would just crack somewhere else very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I could try to tape it up, but, the plastic cracks so easily</li>
      <li>Easy to refill, store, and travel with.</li>
      <li>It is easy to load.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, and easy to re-apply after a bit of swimming.</li>
      <li>The plastic is so cheap that the brush had cracks in it when I got it.  </li>
      <li>But hell, it is cheap, so maybe I should have given five stars.</li>
      <li>I am taking off .4 points because it feels ever so slightly cheap.</li>
      <li>Cap didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The cheap plastic was cracked, they fell apart right away.</li>
      <li>exactly want I was looking for!</li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;d highly recommend spending twice as much and purchasing something more durable and with a fuller brush.</li>
      <li>The concept is right, I just want a higher quality version.</li>
      <li>The brush is soft and the lid is secure.</li>
      <li>brush is a quite a bit looser than say, a quality kabuki brush, but that&#x27;s necessary for the powder to be able to make its way up the brush.</li>
      <li>by the time I noticed, then waited for a response and then a return label and finally was able to get someone to bring it to the post (I can not drive)</li>
      <li>I am looking for a better product, but it&#x27;s hard to tell through photos which one may be better?</li>
      <li>Some still makes it way into the air, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s unavoidable when applying dry powder with a brush.</li>
      <li>Fits great in my small purse; clear lets you know when it&#x27;s time to refill .</li>
      <li>a quick after-beach shower removes the zinc completely.</li>
      <li>Great idea, poor product.</li>
      <li>Very brittle plastic.  </li>
      <li>You have to really tap it agains your skin for the product to power to come out.  </li>
      <li>Very sturdy...</li>
      <li>but I expect them to fall apart really soon.</li>
      <li>The product came cracked and it doesn&#x27;t really work very well.  </li>
      <li>The brush is really flimsy and doesn&#x27;t spread powder well.</li>
      <li>It holds a lot of powder---I am using fine, loose Aveda face powder in it.</li>
      <li>The bristles are a little longer than I would prefer (I like more of a kabuki-style brush), but this isn&#x27;t a criticism--merely an observation.</li>
      <li>no mess or having to open different containers pop the top off and brush, how efficient is that</li>
      <li>I have to wait until the compartment is empty to clean the brush or the powder clumps from the moisture.</li>
      <li>so I could keep a small amount in my purse, it worked well, wish the lid stayed on better, but it served the purpose.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that, despite that, the brush lays down a nice, even coat of corn starch on my son&#x27;s skin, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it did well for other types of powder as well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but I felt like the bristles were scratching me.</li>
      <li>The air pressure pushes into the storage compartment and powder comes out where the lid screws on.&lt;br /&gt;The brush shield (used to get the cover on without bending bristles) can also be completely pulled out if handled a bit</li>
      <li>but so far it&#x27;s holding well.</li>
      <li>wish the bristles were light color, not black and the cap keeps popping off too easily - practically impossible to keep it the a bag.</li>
      <li>Not worth the $7.99 I spent, even with free shipping.</li>
      <li>I ended up putting my bare minerals in there.</li>
      <li>Arrived Cracked &amp; did not really dispense much powder</li>
      <li>I filled it with my Bare Minerals foundation and added a touch of warmth in with it ( if you use this makeup you&#x27;ll know what I mean)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably ok for things like shimmer or glitter, but not great for loose powder.  </li>

    <li> Totally awesome! Very sturdy...exactly want I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I saw this brush and I was looking for something with powder that I could take with me on my purse.&lt;br /&gt;I found this brush and it does the job terrific.</li>
    <li> I should have followed the advice of the other comments.  The product came cracked and it doesn&#x27;t really work very well.  You have to really tap it agains your skin for the product to power to come out.  The bristles are not as soft and the retractor tends to cover the bristles  When I am tapping it down against my face.</li>
    <li> I had one of these years ago, and haven&#x27;t been able to find one since it broke! It came quickly and nicely packaged. I heard some people say it didn&#x27;t work but this one works great! I filled it with my Bare Minerals foundation and added a touch of warmth in with it ( if you use this makeup you&#x27;ll know what I mean)...it&#x27;s so simple to throw in my bag an touch up any time of day, great for bronzer, mineral foundation or whatever your favorite powder is! It&#x27;s a little difficult to fill, but you get just the right amount of powder on your face, so In the end, less mess!!</li>
    <li> Not worth the $7.99 I spent, even with free shipping. The plastic is flimsy and the brush is way too long and thin, it simply bends when trying to use it. All in all, I&#x27;d highly recommend spending twice as much and purchasing something more durable and with a fuller brush.</li>
    <li> Easy to refill, store, and travel with. I filled mine with baby powder and it dispenses perfectly. The size is convenient and stows away great in a purse.</li>
    <li> The plastic is so cheap that the brush had cracks in it when I got it.  Very brittle plastic.  Nothing should be made of this.  I will never even get to use it.  I could try to tape it up, but, the plastic cracks so easily it would just crack somewhere else very quickly.  I don&#x27;t qualify for a refund because I didn&#x27;t get to open the package until now.  Money wasted.  Never again.</li>
    <li> Took this product (filled with zinc powdered (not micronized) sunscreen) with me to the beach to use on my very light skinned toddler. Her hair is so sparse, and she refuses to keep a hat on, - so this seemed the perfect solution. It&#x27;s easy to apply, and easy to re-apply after a bit of swimming. This is a good alternative to chemical sunscreens, there is no worry of hormone disruption, of toxicity and a quick after-beach shower removes the zinc completely.</li>
    <li> I used this to actually put some powdered sunscreen so I could keep a small amount in my purse, it worked well, wish the lid stayed on better, but it served the purpose.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. Thin brittle plastic. I ordered two and they both came already cracked in more than one place despite good packaging in the mail. I taped them together and am using them- they do work- but I expect them to fall apart really soon. I am looking for a better product, but it&#x27;s hard to tell through photos which one may be better? Would love suggestions. I made my own mineral sunscreen (cheap and easy folks) and want to have it in these for easy use. The concept is right, I just want a higher quality version.</li>
    <li> Spews powder everywhere. Returned!</li>
    <li> Construction is pretty flimsy and the cap falls off, making it useless for carrying outside the house unless you want powder all over your bag.</li>
    <li> I recently started using baking soda as deodorant due to an allergy to commercial deodorant.  I fill the end with the baking soda and apply.  It needs a few taps to get going, but works well otherwise.  It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because of the difficulty in cleaning.  I have to wait until the compartment is empty to clean the brush or the powder clumps from the moisture.</li>
    <li> was broken when it got to me...had to superglue the side coz it cracked...not even worth the money i paid for...just dont.</li>
    <li> I find this little brush almost useless. Can&#x27;t decide if it is &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; somewhere or if it just doesn&#x27;t work well. I felt like it was too inexpensive to send back....now it&#x27;s something to stick in my bag for the thrift store. Maybe I&#x27;m experiencing operator error and someone else can make it work.</li>
    <li> Arrived Cracked &amp; did not really dispense much powder</li>
    <li> It was just....ok. The brush itself was too long and not very soft. It&#x27;s probably ok for things like shimmer or glitter, but not great for loose powder.  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but I felt like the bristles were scratching me.</li>
    <li> I had one similar to this from Lancome, but sadly they don&#x27;t make it any longer.  I was looking for a replacement, but this isn&#x27;t that great.  I think the bristles are way too long and way too flimsy.  While powder does come out, it takes quite a bit of effort to do so.  Would not buy this item again.</li>
    <li> The brush is really flimsy and doesn&#x27;t spread powder well. The powder also doesn&#x27;t come out well. I ended up splurging on a good one.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a pretty good product. Unlike the other reviewer, I had no problems getting this to work--the powder comes out as expected. I am taking off .4 points because it feels ever so slightly cheap. But hell, it is cheap, so maybe I should have given five stars. The brush is soft and the lid is secure. It holds a lot of powder---I am using fine, loose Aveda face powder in it. The bristles are a little longer than I would prefer (I like more of a kabuki-style brush), but this isn&#x27;t a criticism--merely an observation.</li>
    <li> the quality of the product is poor.  cap came broke, bristles fall out when using. I dont recommend this product</li>
    <li> hard to operate, powder does not fit well inside. i thought it had a storage area within the handle, but it does not have one that works. wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> mine came broken. by the time I noticed, then waited for a response and then a return label and finally was able to get someone to bring it to the post (I can not drive) Just a few days later, I GOT it BACK in the mail, stating I had just missed the return date so I had to keep it!&lt;br /&gt;I asume it probably cost almost the same for shipping to and from and the time to repackage it and send it to me TWICE and all because it was just late enough getting back seems silly to me.&lt;br /&gt;And I can&#x27;t think it was made well when it came broken the way it did.</li>
    <li> the idea is awesome. wish the bristles were light color, not black and the cap keeps popping off too easily - practically impossible to keep it the a bag. but the idea and concept of it is totaly awesome.</li>
    <li> end falls off so the powder escapes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to apply corn starch (talcum powder is now considered bad because there&#x27;s no way to avoid baby breathing it in) to my son&#x27;s neck since our pediatrician recommended it for his drool rash. It is the fastest, cleanest, most convenient way I&#x27;ve found to apply corn starch to all the nooks and crannies of a wiggly baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The barrier between the compartment and the brush is reticulated foam, so those who have had trouble getting powder to go through could probably stab at it a bit with a needle to help (though I&#x27;m usually annoyed with brand new items that need modifications).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking off one star because the powder does get out a bit when putting on the cover. The air pressure pushes into the storage compartment and powder comes out where the lid screws on.&lt;br /&gt;The brush shield (used to get the cover on without bending bristles) can also be completely pulled out if handled a bit recklessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a quite a bit looser than say, a quality kabuki brush, but that&#x27;s necessary for the powder to be able to make its way up the brush. I&#x27;ve found that, despite that, the brush lays down a nice, even coat of corn starch on my son&#x27;s skin, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it did well for other types of powder as well. Some still makes it way into the air, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s unavoidable when applying dry powder with a brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is refillable, and easy to transport, which I love. The brush itself is not the greatest for makeup but is good backup for loose powder touch-up. it&#x27;s not the sturdiest design. I think it would be best used for powder sunscreen, which is what I bought it for initially. I ended up putting my bare minerals in there. I only use it every once in a while.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of ordering two.&lt;br /&gt;The cheap plastic was cracked, they fell apart right away. I won&#x27;t even try to get powder in there, I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;ll just be a waste.</li>
    <li> The cap is too loose and dies not stay on so I did not put any powder in it. Great idea, poor product.</li>
    <li> Cap didn&#x27;t fit. It&#x27;s unusable.</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks before rating to check the seal but so far it&#x27;s holding well. Fits great in my small purse; clear lets you know when it&#x27;s time to refill . Good price</li>
    <li> Good for travel no mess or having to open different containers pop the top off and brush, how efficient is that</li>
    <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t stay on well</li>
    <li> The retractable bristle cover makes the brush stay nice. It is easy to load. Glitter and setting powder come out nicely.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time applying Zinc powder with this brish, too much comes out and I find it tough to control.</li>
    <li> This brush was extremely stiff. The bristles were hard and black. Similar to the texture of a mascara wands bristles. Was not impressed with the application of powder as the bristles all matted and the texture was rough.</li>
