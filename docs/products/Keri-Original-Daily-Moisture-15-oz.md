      <li>The best for very dry skin.</li>
      <li>and this really feels good on my face and gives it a shiny glow for quite a while.  </li>
      <li>Many, many years ago, we first came upon this Keri Lotion, as it was the preferred Lotion utilized by our then local hospital when one of our family members had a hospital stay, and we tried this lotion for ourselves and were very pleased with its performance to help healing skin and provide efficient moisturization, and along the ways, we became disconnected from this Lotion but with no purposeful intention, so when we found this available on Amazon, we immediately ordered it, and we are still over the top pleased with its performance, and this is an old, well-known product which has been proven, supposedly, through the tests of time, and it is still here, so great, and thank you to our favorite Amazon for making it available.</li>
      <li>Original body lotion is an ideal daily skin moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite body lotion because it smells clean (perfect for anyone) and most importantly penetrates my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Best stuff around...hands down!</li>
      <li>I use it in my lotion heater and enjoy a mini spa treatment each time.</li>
      <li>It is a great moisturizer but is no greasy and it last all day.</li>
      <li>lotion has kept my feet crack free</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly but does not require a lot to get the job done.</li>
      <li>It softens and smooth your skin.  </li>

      <li>Thanks Amazon, I just ordered 10 bottles!!!</li>
      <li>LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR THIS ORIGINAL, HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS.  </li>
      <li>THE ORIGINAL.</li>
      <li>IT GOES ON SMOOTHLY AND IS EASILY ABSORBED AND KEEPS MY SKIN SMOOTH AND COMFORTABLE IN EVERY SEASON.  </li>
      <li>Very rich product and good for dry skin...has oils in it.</li>
      <li>Great for my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Great for dry skin!</li>
      <li>This is greasy but it works great for itchy dry skin!</li>
      <li>it was absorbed almost immediately and my skin became so smooth.</li>
      <li>IT ALSO HAS A DELIGHTFUL LOW KEY SCENT.  </li>
      <li>Loyal consumer since 1981.  </li>
      <li>Keri lotion has been around for a long time for good reason.  </li>
      <li>A quick dollop on my hands stops the broken, flaky cuticles and keeps my hands looking great and feeling comfortable!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without Keri original!  </li>
      <li>Love this lotion, keeps my skin nice and moist through the harsh winter months.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried numerous lotions and this is the BEST one and is the ONLY one that really works.  </li>
      <li>There are so many other choices out there, many under my counter, but this is the one I grab every day in the end.</li>
      <li>It has a subtle baby lotion scent and is incredibly moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>PLEASE BRING BACK OLD ORIGINAL KERI!!!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t recommend riding a motorcycle right after applying ;)</li>
      <li>Great reviews about Keri lotion before 2010 no longer hold true to new Keri because new Keri formula is no longer same as old one.</li>
      <li>I had been a big fan of Keri and used for many years.</li>
      <li>Only gave this 2 starts based on my ordering my favorite lotion...</li>
      <li>It was recommended to me by a doctor when I told him that my skin was not adapting to the dryness of the southern Californian climate after moving here from a place that is humid most of the year.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of body butters, creams and moisturizers to keep my skin hydrated in the winter.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this body lotion for more than ten years, its almost a family tradition</li>
      <li>Good lotion, although it leaves my hands somewhat greasy after using it and not as soft as I would like since I have dry skin.</li>
      <li>We are delighted to have this lotion back again on our personal shelves.</li>
      <li>I do know is that the lotion is simple, lightly fragranced, smooth, and completely moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price because it takes care of my ashy skin better than any other lotion.  </li>
      <li>Most beneficial in treating dry skin.</li>
      <li>It is somewhat greasy when first applied, perhaps because mineral oil in suspension is one of the main ingredients.</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and have been using keri for years and love it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes except for the packaging.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Took care of my skin needs!</li>
    <li> Awful smell NOT THE ORIGINAL. Keri no longer makes the lotion I have bought for 40 years</li>
    <li> My mom is in love this cream. I ended buying 5+. Going to be buying more since it&#x27;s not available in stores</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a lover of Keri for years. Love the autoship.</li>
    <li> Best stuff around...hands down!</li>
    <li> I have been using Keri for years.  I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like it after they changed the formula, but once I tried it I have kept using it.  It truly helps my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Keri for over 20 years. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes except for the packaging. Some reviewers say the formula has changed but I don&#x27;t have the old ingredient list to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do know is that the lotion is simple, lightly fragranced, smooth, and completely moisturizing. It was recommended to me by a doctor when I told him that my skin was not adapting to the dryness of the southern Californian climate after moving here from a place that is humid most of the year. This lotion healed all the painful cracks in my skin and after 20 years, my skin is always smooth and soft, so long as I use this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keri lotion is the thickest and most moisturizing lotion I have used. It adheres to the skin very well and the slowly absorbs in. When initially smoothed on, it does leave a sheen and is a little tacky to the touch. I typically give it a few minutes to absorb and work its magic before I put on my clothes. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and Eucerin Intensive Repair lotion is close but Keri still works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really sad when Costco stopped carrying Keri in the economy sized bottles several of years ago. Keri is hard to find in stores and is usually one of the more expensive bottles of lotion on store shelves. I can&#x27;t believe I found it on Amazon. The price is amazing and it&#x27;s even available for subscribe and save!!! I&#x27;ve been paying almost double at the local stores all these years. Thanks Amazon, I just ordered 10 bottles!!!</li>
    <li> Keri is great except for that greasy feeling after you&#x27;ve rubbed it in. I prefer the Nivea extended moisture.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this at Costco.  They no longer carry it.  I live in Utah with 11% humidity.  Keri Lotion is the ONLY one that works.  Amazon is the solution.  I&#x27;m happy again!</li>
    <li> For some reason it is really hard to find this lotion in the stores.  Glad I found it here and for a good price.  I have really dry skin and this is the only lotion that does dry up in 1 minute.  I love it.  Good old faithful.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by Keri lotion.  She&#x27;s been using it for years.  She couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores nearby. She asked me to see if I could find it on the internet.  I found it.  Bought 5 bottles.  They sent it.  She&#x27;s happy.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I keep on on my desk, on my nightstand, and several other locations.  A quick dollop on my hands stops the broken, flaky cuticles and keeps my hands looking great and feeling comfortable!</li>
    <li> My best friend introduced me to the Keri Original lotion, after I noticed how shiny her skin appeared.  This lotion provides all-day moisture and leaves a shiny appearance (which I like).  The Nivea original moisture lotion has a similar sheen but is noticeably thicker than Keri.  I give the Keri lotion 4 stars instead of 5 because of the fragrance.  It isn&#x27;t a horrible scent but it definitely could be improved upon.  Our husbands complain about the scent (so we cover it up with some other body fragrance).  I preferred the black bottle and was disappointed that it was discontinued.  Up until September 2011 I easily found this lotion in most grocery stores.  Since that time it has been out of stock at every store I have checked (Target, Safeway, Fred Meyer, etc.).  I normally paid under $8/bottle in stores, which was less expensive than the Online price.</li>
    <li> As advertised and shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> I have used Keri Lotion for years; it is a great product, and nothing compares with it.  I wish Amazon carried a larger size like 40 ounces.</li>
    <li> WE love the product. It really helps dry skin. Love it, would recommend it to anyone .My husband thinks it is great</li>
    <li> Best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used it for 40 years.</li>
    <li> YOU SENT ME THE WRONG BOTTLE I ORDERED THE ORIGINAL IN A BLACK BOTTLE BUT YOU SENT ME LOTION IN A WHITE BOTTLE. I DID NOT SEND IT BACK BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF IT AND COULD NOT FIND IT HERE. I WOULD HAVE  RATED IT 5 STAR BECAUSE I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS,</li>
    <li> Years ago when I worked in a pharmacy, the Pharmacist recommended this lotion to all who inquired.  I recommended it to a friend suffering cancer and side effects of treatment.  It was the only lotion that worked for her.  Since I moved to the arid Arizona climate, my husband and I use it exclusively.  Nothing, not even Curel, works as well as Keri to relieve dry/itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without Keri original!  Loyal consumer since 1981.  My son had eczema, the pediatrician recommended Keri.  Now the four generations use it daily!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried numerous lotions and this is the BEST one and is the ONLY one that really works.  i&#x27;ve been using it for 20 years every day without fail and people are always commenting on how well moisturized my skin is.  my entire family uses it, we&#x27;ve tried others, and nothing works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont know why retail stores like costco have stopped carrying it, but now with amazon and their subscription service, it makes it cost effective and super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love keri.  the original one is the best.  i dont feel the others work nearly as good.</li>
    <li> I have been A DEVOTED USER OF kERI lOTION FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS.  IT GOES ON SMOOTHLY AND IS EASILY ABSORBED AND KEEPS MY SKIN SMOOTH AND COMFORTABLE IN EVERY SEASON.  IT ALSO HAS A DELIGHTFUL LOW KEY SCENT.  IT HAS BEEN HARD TO FIND THE PAST FEW YEARS SO I AM PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO ORDER IT FROM AMAZON.</li>
    <li> this product never disappoints. Leaves the skin looking nice almost all day, not sticky at all. I&#x27;ve been using this body lotion for more than ten years, its almost a family tradition</li>
    <li> Best lotion to use right before I go to bed, otherwise its too greasy for anything else (for the floor or the hands)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has kept my feet crack free</li>
    <li> Have used it for over 30 years. Love it! My skin shows that I have used the best lotion in the world. Keri!!!</li>
    <li> Only gave this 2 starts based on my ordering my favorite lotion... yet every time it arrives, it has lotion all over it.  My last purchase, (1-2 wks ago), it at least came in a sealed clear bag so all the lotion was inside of it.  It&#x27;s really not that hard for company and packers to ensure that screw top is on good and tight eliminating the mess as well as not wasting money on lotion that&#x27;s all over the place before arriving.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. I have used this product for forty years starting with my first born straight from the hospital. I have used&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno, which I like also and some off brand I can&#x27;t remember the names, but I always go back to Keri.</li>
    <li> I am 63 years old and have used Keri lotion ever since I was in my teens.  It is great.  Keeps your skin soft and moisturized ALL year long.</li>
    <li> I have eczema so this lotion has always worked for me.  I can never find it in stores so thank goodness it&#x27;s on here and I can get in on subscription!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Original Keri for years for his dry senistive skin.  He&#x27;s tried countless others and the other Keri folmulas he always goes back to this one because it just works the best for him.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended it for my skin in our dry, arid location.  It works great!</li>
    <li> My favorite; great for dry skin, pleasant scent</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It is an essential part of my morning routine.  It goes on smoothly but does not require a lot to get the job done.</li>
    <li> This is greasy but it works great for itchy dry skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and have used Keri for 40 years. Most beneficial in treating dry skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect lotion for dry skin</li>
    <li> I was in the hospital few years ago and they gave small (travel size) to use.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it and been using it since.&lt;br /&gt;Keri Original body lotion is an ideal daily skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years, dermatologist recommended because of really dry skin. It is the only thing that works for me but it is sometimes hard to find. glad i was able to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, really hard to find in local stores.  If you don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling of lotion, I would avoid this.  I think this has no (or little?) alcohol in it which means it isn&#x27;t just evaporating the moment you put it on.  I have really dry skin and this really feels good on my face and gives it a shiny glow for quite a while.  Don&#x27;t recommend riding a motorcycle right after applying ;)</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I haven&#x27;t found this on the shelves in my stores.  Will be ordering again soon.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have been using keri for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion and have used it for very dry skin for years. Please keep making it! I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Good lotion, although it leaves my hands somewhat greasy after using it and not as soft as I would like since I have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Liked the deal, love the lotion</li>
    <li> Have been using Keri lotion for over 15 years and this is the only one that works for me.  Wish Costco still carried it.</li>
    <li> My kids Dr. noticed my 2 year old with dry skin.  He recommended Keri Lotion.  It&#x27;s awesome and I haven&#x27;t used anything else since.  It&#x27;s not greasy and a nice light weight lotion and relives the itchy feeling.</li>
    <li> I have been a Keri user from many, many years! In fact, this was my mom&#x27;s choice of body lotion, so I grew up using it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other body lotions and my skin loves nothing else. Of late, I mix my Keri with a few drops of all natural coconut oil, after my evening shower and my skin has a glow that I have never seen before.... Will be a Keri user for as long as it is made!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of body butters, creams and moisturizers to keep my skin hydrated in the winter.  It can get so dry here in NYC in the winters.  My husband was the one who turned me on to this lotion.  He told me his mother used to use it on him and his siblings when they were kids.  I absolutely love it. It has a subtle baby lotion scent and is incredibly moisturizing.  I can&#x27;t believe a product like this is actually affordable.</li>
    <li> I find it very effective for preventing chapped hands in cold and dry weather. It is somewhat greasy when first applied, perhaps because mineral oil in suspension is one of the main ingredients. Amazon price is a couple of dollars less than the price in drugstores in Southern California.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it is hard to find in the stores.  Winter is very hard on my skin and I swim year round.  It is a great moisturizer but is no greasy and it last all day.</li>
    <li> best lotion in the world!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I grew up using it, but it is so hard to find in stores these days. Great for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Been using Keri for thirty years now and my 64 year old skin looks like I&#x27;m in my thirties.  Keeps my skin soft without any oily feeling and lasts so long I only have to use in the am and pm.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It moisturizes my skin without leaving my skin feeling greasy. I also like that it lacks an over powering fragrance.  I have been using this lotion for well over 10 years. I always buy from Amazon. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Keeps my dry skin lubricated!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greasy but it works!</li>
    <li> Great for my dry skin.  One application last all day.  Best for me in the winter when my skin is driest.  It softens and smooth your skin.  It&#x27;s worth the price because it takes care of my ashy skin better than any other lotion.  It&#x27;s not thick and hard to smooth on.</li>
    <li> The package says \\&quot;Original\\&quot;, but don&#x27;t be fooled by that. When I first used Keri in early 2000s, I thought this was exactly I had been looking for - it was absorbed almost immediately and my skin became so smooth. I had been a big fan of Keri and used for many years. However, after Novartis bought Keri brand from Bristol-Myers, this lotion had completely changed from package to ingredients. First, Novartis changed the package to ugly \\&quot;BLACK\\&quot; bottle with the pink and gold label. I hated the black bottle, which was really awful. Fortunately, Novartis realized how awful it was and renewed the package again which is very similar to the original white bottle. But then Novartis changed the formula around 2010 (? if I remember well). One day I noticed that Keri became very greasy. So I checked ingredients and found that it contained mineral oil. The original Keri didn&#x27;t use bad ingredients such as Mineral oil (I still keep an old \\&quot;original\\&quot; bottle. Mineral oil was not used before). New Keri lotion is not absorbed in my skin smoothly. It is so greasy that I have to sweep off excess oil with tissue paper. Now my skin hates this lotion. Be careful with this product. Great reviews about Keri lotion before 2010 no longer hold true to new Keri because new Keri formula is no longer same as old one. This review is nothing to do with the seller (sorry!) but I can&#x27;t stand what Novartis is doing. Novartis completely ruined the wonderful Keri lotion. PLEASE BRING BACK OLD ORIGINAL KERI!!!</li>
    <li> Love Keri Lotion.  I have use the lotion for many years.  I have very dry skin and this is the only lotion that helps my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since I was a pre-teen, and its benefits to the suppleness of my skin now that i am significantly older, was mentioned by Doc who had to give me a couple of stitches in a small wound.  I am a Keri girl for life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Keri Lotion since I was in college 32 years ago and I have a hard time finding it in the stores. Glad that it is on Amazon.com because my skin was in need of moisture. About 2 weeks ago, I got a 1st degree burn on my harm and I used the Keri lotion daily so now the scar is barely visible. My husband even uses it because it took away his dry skin. We took it on a cruise with us and to the beach and we use it year round! When we run out I will order more!</li>
    <li> i have dry skin, this works well for me</li>
    <li> LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR THIS ORIGINAL, HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS.  I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT</li>
    <li> I use this lotion every day including face. Can&#x27;t live without it. Creamy but not greasy. Goes a long way</li>
    <li> I have loved Keri lotion for many years.  Started having trouble finding it locally here in Michigan.  Glad I&#x27;m able to get through Amazon.  Very rich product and good for dry skin...has oils in it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, keeps my skin nice and moist through the harsh winter months. Great deal on Amazon too!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a great smell and is very moisturizing. I used to use this years ago and then Target stopped carrying it.  I switched to Jergens which smells great but doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I would like although it&#x27;s great too.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite body lotion because it smells clean (perfect for anyone) and most importantly penetrates my dry skin. There are so many other choices out there, many under my counter, but this is the one I grab every day in the end.</li>
    <li> Many, many years ago, we first came upon this Keri Lotion, as it was the preferred Lotion utilized by our then local hospital when one of our family members had a hospital stay, and we tried this lotion for ourselves and were very pleased with its performance to help healing skin and provide efficient moisturization, and along the ways, we became disconnected from this Lotion but with no purposeful intention, so when we found this available on Amazon, we immediately ordered it, and we are still over the top pleased with its performance, and this is an old, well-known product which has been proven, supposedly, through the tests of time, and it is still here, so great, and thank you to our favorite Amazon for making it available. We are delighted to have this lotion back again on our personal shelves. Blessings.</li>
    <li> We have used Alpha Keri for 40 years! We did not know that this lotion contains parabens and other chemicals that are cancer producing and just plain dangerous! I DO NOT WANT IT!~!!</li>
    <li> Keri lotion has been around for a long time for good reason.  It is a superb moisturizer.  I use it in my lotion heater and enjoy a mini spa treatment each time.</li>
    <li> The best for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Always takes care of my winter dryness!</li>
