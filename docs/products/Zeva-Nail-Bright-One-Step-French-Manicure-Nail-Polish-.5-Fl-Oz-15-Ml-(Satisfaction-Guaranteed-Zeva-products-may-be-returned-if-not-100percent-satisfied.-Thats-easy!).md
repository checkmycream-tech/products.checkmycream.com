<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife loves this nail&lt;br /&gt;stuff.. she wished it came in a bigger bottle .like it use to be ..A++.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34; even after reading both positive and negative reviews.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I don&#x27;t have the money for manicures and pedicures, or the patience to give myself a French manicure.  With one coat of Zeva, I get pinker nail beds, which make my nail tips look whiter.  This does not MAKE the tips whiter - that would take white polish.  But the tips are accented by the pinky nail beds, and look whiter.  This works great on the toes as well.  The accompanying literature says that the general health of one&#x27;s nails affect how the brightener will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product (and I very rarely bother to review anything)!</li>
    <li> I am extremely impressed by this product.  The nail polish is very long lasting.  When I apply 2 coats to a french manicure, the manicure lasts up to 7 days with only tiny chips appearing on the 6th or 7th day (which can easily be touched up).  I have also applied it over a clear \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; basecoat and have had the same long lasting results.  As described, the nail polish does make your nail bed pinker but I did not notice the tips of my nails looking any whiter.  Although it is a clear nail polish, there is a beautiful cast to the polish in the bright light giving the nail a noticeable clean and finished appearance.   Although I don&#x27;t think it looks like an actual French Manicure, when used alone, the results are very pretty.  I liked the product so much that I bought two additional bottles for gifts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does; makes my nail beds pink and the tips whiter.  Fast and easy to apply.  No foul smell.  Makes my nails look so healthy.  The customer service is awesome; they had to ship it by boat due to shipping restrictions overseas and emailed me immediately to apologize that it would take so long. It was worth the wait and I will be a faithful customer.</li>
    <li> I was searching for another product I had bought years before.  All it had on the label was NBN French Nails, and needless to say after googleing and what ever else I could not find it.  Decided to try Zeva Nail Bright one-step french manicure, It works just as well and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this would work for me but it really was not the best. It was more like a clear coat for me, as it just made my nails a little more transluscent and not so much white. I did notice a \\&quot;pinking\\&quot; of the nail bed, but it wasn&#x27;t a very definite change. I will give it another try and see how it works, but to me, it doesn&#x27;t justify the price tag. Given the chance, I most likely would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I really love the look of a French manicure, but I have no way of doing one for myself. I&#x27;m not that talented. This polish doesn&#x27;t give you a real French manicure look, but it does make your nails look beautiful. They look very shiny and in the sunlight they look even whiter. If you are not looking for a miracle, this is a great clear coat.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over ten years. I bought four bottles about 8 yrs ago, and my last one I am on right now. Its just like the first bottle was. Perfect!!!!    Will be buying more as I now know the product last For a very Long Time!!  Now getting to how it wears and looks. It looks so fresh and clean. It wears forever!!!  Nothing like it. Please never stop making Zeva</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I found the zeva nail polish here. Like the other reviewer, I used to order this from QVC.  It&#x27;s the best clear nail polish EVER.  It gives a very clear look. So glad it&#x27;s still available.</li>
    <li> This polish looks amazing, especially in fluorescent light. It&#x27;s even better than clear polish for a tidy, professional home mani. However, as soon as you go outside, it turns this queer purplish color. The white part of your nail still looks super white, the bed just looks purplish, like you&#x27;re suffering from hypoxia or something. I&#x27;m way too lazy to get regular manis, so for now, this is still my go to polish unless I go crazy and colorful with my beloved EssieMadamoiselle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years after purchasing it from QVC. It does what it says. It makes the tips of your fingernails whiter and your nailbeds pinker. Only a real French Manicure makes your nail tips whiter. I love the fact that it lasts and lasts and lasts and makes my nails shine and always look like I have a fresh manicure. The first product that I purchased from QVC is several years old and has not thickened and become unusable. It has not yellowed either. Try this product if you like your nails to shine and you are not a great fan of chipping color on your nails. It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on manicures. TRY IT!!!!!! YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this nail polish.  I was looking for an easy way to have natural looking nails but would also whiten my tips.  The nail polish does brighten the nail but looks nothing like a french manicure.  It&#x27;s basically a clear polish with some neon blue color which can look a bit weird in some lighting.  I found it to be a good undercoat for brightening my nails when I apply a light pink nail color.  When worn alone, I find that the polish yellow after just a couple of days and looks terrible.</li>
    <li> I had this years ago from QVC.  I do not like color polish on my fingers, so I like how this looks like a simple french manicure with no effort.  It appears to last longer too!</li>
    <li> Tired of the expense and time of the nail salon, I dug through my box of nail polishes and files packed away years ago when I started wearing  acrylics. Most of my polishes were gooey and dried up but there was the Zeva Nail Bright, still liquid. I had forgotten all about it. I brushed it on and WOW, I had an instant French manicure. I&#x27;m back for more - just love this stuff.  Tip - use an electric toothbrush and brush your clean nails (without polish) with super-whitening toothpaste to make the tips of your nails even whiter, then use the Zeva.[[ASIN:B0011DTFEW Colgate Total Whitening Paste Toothpaste: Super Size 7.8 OZ]]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fast drying polish.  I was hoping that my tips would whiten up just a bit and the rest of the nail would pink up a bit, too.  Just a fast drying clear polish that seems to have an ingredient that prevents yellowing, which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 72 and in all my years have never found anything as quick and easy as Zeva Nail Bright to instantly make my nails appear to have just walked out of a salon.  If you like the French Manicure look, you will be satisfied with this product and it is so easy on your wallet.&lt;br /&gt;You haven&#x27;t got much to loose by trying it, but you have a lot to loose if you get a professional French manicure instead. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the positive reviews on this site and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.  I didn&#x27;t expect this polish to turn my nails an entirely different color or look exactly like a French manicure with the stark white tips. What I like about the polish is that it goes on very easily, dries quickly and does definitely brighten up the look of the nails. Under indoor lighting it is a very subtle brightening but when you go out into the daylight - the nails almost look a purple looking white. Not obtrusively so but definitely noticeable when outside. Even better than the brightening is how this polish will last. It has been the best I&#x27;ve seen when compared to non shellac polishes.  I can put this on at the beginning of the week and it still looks great at the end of the week with no chipping. I spend a few minutes once a week doing my own manicure and I&#x27;m set for the week with natural, well kept looking nails.   If you like a natural looking nail but better - this polish is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought hundreds of products on Amazon but this is my first review, I think! I&#x27;m writing a review not just because this polish really DOES what is described (and I&#x27;ve tried them *all*) - but it is also motivated by the customer service I received by Zeva Nails.     I had a question about the polish &amp; called the phone number on my receipt and WOW, if you want to be impressed - just call the company&#x27;s phone number. They are so helpful, are incredibly knowledgeable about their products, and want you to be 100% happy with your purchase - and I was! Thank you! I will be a long-term customer.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a relative, but she said it worked great and really liked it. It made the tips of your fingernails look whiter and the nail beds look pinker. I really want a bottle now!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and I absolutely love it. I found it after I decided to ditch the acrylics because of the damage, cost and upkeep. You just brush it on, it dries quickly and off you go.</li>
    <li> Perfect, as described!</li>
    <li> I like the Zena Nail Bright. It is a pretty soft, glossy, pink color. I have a hard time keeping nail polish on, this one seems to stay on longer than others I have tried. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to spend less money at the nail salon and be able to do my nails at home....I could have went to the drug store, paid less money, and gotten the same results.  This product chips very easily (I followed all the directions) and it did brighten my nails but its certainly not a \\&quot;french manicure\\&quot;.  It also didn&#x27;t pinken my nails but rather turned them cloudy.  Not worh the money IMO and I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do what it says.  I was looking for a product that would brighten my discolored nails, which this did not do.  It looks ok on my nails...pretty much like any clear nail polish would, but nothing special.  I gave this 3 stars because it came really quickly, great packaging and they even included a free sample of one their products that I had been wanting to try (the whitening nail bubbles).  I was really happy to receive the sample...although that didn&#x27;t brighten my nails either :/    I really wanted to like this product, but it just didn&#x27;t do much for me.    Updated: 9/28/14    I don&#x27;t think I gave this product enough of a chance.  I previously gave it 3 stars, but I&#x27;ve used it many times since and I actually really like this polish.  First, the seller has GREAT customer service.  Secondly, I does look different than plain old clear nail polish.  It&#x27;s difficult to describe, but it gives sort of a glow-in-the-dark, bright effect.  Sounds weird, but it looks really pretty.  I&#x27;m updating my review now because I plan to re-purchase, and it&#x27;s only right to be honest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands &amp; types of optical nail brighteners over the years, &amp; this has proved to be my favorite of them all. I&#x27;ve tried cheap &amp; intermediate versions (like drugstore Yello-Out) which have the sad side effect of peeling off soon after immersing hands in water, and also tried the expensive high-end brands like Dior Nail Glow &amp; Perfect Formula Pink Gel Coat, both of which work great &amp; don&#x27;t peel off but cost a lot &amp; provide a pink optical hue. I love the blue-lavender glow effect of Zeva, it appeals to me the most. Price of Zeva is up there too, but it&#x27;s worth the cost &amp; lasts a long time, as this product clings to the nail &amp; doesn&#x27;t peel off after showering or washing. I love the durability of wear. I wear Zeva either by itself for that glowy clean nail look as well as a base under color nailpolish. I find it to be very versatile. It&#x27;s easy to apply, wears long, removes cleanly, &amp; the packaging is simple but nice - love the rubbery-grip handle &amp; basic cylinder bottle. I hope this product never gets discontinued. Love Zeva&#x27;s free shipping offer on $25+ orders.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, clean natural nails are so easy to achieve with Nail Bright. I have used this product for years and have found the pretty clean look better than any other similar product.  It lasts much longer then other brands I have tried even when washing dishes everyday.</li>
    <li> I really love, love, love this product.  I use it all the time and people actually think that I have paid for a \\&quot;French Manicure\\&quot;.  Would recommend for anyone, even tweens.</li>
    <li> I used to order this FABULOUS product from QVC. I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I was to find it again. (ordered 2 bottles!) Makes your nails look so clean and cared for..just lovely! I&#x27;m not much for colored nail polish so this is perfect for me. Worth every penny! I&#x27;ve never been so satisfied with a nail product ever! Simply superb!CONGRATULATIONS ZEVA!!</li>
    <li> I do not take care of my nails in general, but recently let them grow &amp; amazingly, several people commented how nice they looked (didn&#x27;t think it made much difference).  As you can imagine, I am not good with polish &amp; don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to do several coats.  I love the french manicure look, but since I wanted no steps, 1 coat easy, I googled &amp; found this product.  Just applied it &amp; *WOW* - I don&#x27;t understand how this looks so great, but it does - in 1 coat!!!  I also ordered their nail bubbles (did that first, once weekly whitening soak) &amp; I can&#x27;t wait for everyone to notice my manicure :)  Do yourself a huge, time saving favor, grab this - it is amazing! :)</li>
    <li> Works great - I struggle with having a yellowish tint to my nails from always having polish on, and this stuff makes my natural nails look nice again! Have tried many others to brighten my nails, this is worth the price - nothing else comes close.</li>
    <li> ZEVA is absolutely the BEST nail product on the market~I have been using it for at least twenty years and hope it will be around for twenty more years! It helps me grow my nails out and it is the only whitener (I&#x27;ve tried all the less expensive brands) that truely works, so it really is worth the extra $.  One coat does it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this years ago on qvc.  It gives a lovely french manicure look on your nails, I love this product.</li>
    <li> Goes on nails smoothly, nails are pink and dries fast. Good for someone that likes natural look. Also it was wrapped and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Years ago I purchased a 3 file system, a tea tree oil cuticle oil pen and a bottle of &#x27;french manicure in a bottle&#x27; polish at a southern womens show.  I was hoping this was the same stuff, it was awesome! however, this is not even close to that stuff.  It seems to have a much better appearance in the sunlight so I think it has something to do with the UV light.  The polish I was looking for had similar properties (looked better in the sun), but this stuff isnt what I wanted :(&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping it because it seems to last a long time on my nails, and it dries fast but its just not worth the $15! I wont be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I have been buying a similar product for years and it would peel off, so I thought I would try something else to see how it works. I absolutely love Zeva Nail Bright! The name says it all, my nails look bright and look like I have a french manicure with no peeling. I am a permanant customer now!</li>
    <li> Good polish that lasts quite awhile.  I didn&#x27;t get a really noticeable pink/white contrast, so I put on a second coat.  That gave me a purply pink which is more noticeable in the sun.  Still, I do love the polish and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 years and love it! Frequently I&#x27;m doing demonstrations with my hands and like my nails to look &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; but not flashy. This product gives a professional look very quickly and is SO easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to give this 4.5 stars because the &amp;#34;French manicure&amp;#34; claim is a bit much.  Still, it does deepen the pink tone of your nail bed and it does lighten the white part of your nails.  It makes them look healthy and pretty, which I love, but it doesn&#x27;t look like a French manicure.  In direct sunlight there&#x27;s a strange bluish tone to it, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much as it&#x27;s not very noticeable.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.  I really love it.</li>
    <li> Love this polish. Have been using it and gifting it to others who end up loving it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 3 yrs ago on a whim after reading the reviews. I used to use the Yellow Stopper you get at Sally&#x27;s but I think they changed the formula and it didn&#x27;t seem to work as it used to. My bottle of Zeva nail brightener is now finished... I am getting another one because I will be wedding soon and considering the simple clean healthy look of Zeva on my long natural nails. I&#x27;m also considering giving a bottles of Zeva nail brightener as a gift to my bridesmaids. I think they&#x27;ll find it very useful. I hope they continue to make this product for the rest of my life it makes my nails sooo beautiful especially in natural light. I will also get my mom a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;I love nail polish soo much, love the colors but they discolor and disfigure my beautiful nails! Zeva is the only nail polish that I love that loves me back and therefore has a special spot in my purse!</li>
    <li> Perfect polish for natural nails! It truly does what it says! It whitens the tips of your nails and pinks up the nail bed! I get compliments on my nails all the time. I had a hard time finding this polish but am so glad that I found it on Amazon! It looks like a beautiful natural French manicure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a quick fix that makes my nails look like a million bucks! Every couple of days I give a quick buff and reapply.</li>
    <li> I chose five stars because it is easy to apply, it has a slight pinking of my nail beds and seems to really brightens my tips... a few friends have asked who &amp;#34;does my nails&amp;#34; as it appears to have a nice salon look.  The price is much more than the standard $2.00 bottle at a drug store, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  It works just as well with one coat as two, and I usually do not need two coats unless I want to refresh it quickly before going out.  It is easy to remove, and I have recommended it to several family members and friends.</li>
    <li> This Nail product is ABSOULETY THE BEST!!!!  I use most of their nail products but this is absolutely my favorite.  I work with a keyboard and regular nail polish just comes off the tips and I don&#x27;t like to pay to have my fingernails done but this clear is a deep crystal clear almost &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look.  I have been using this for about 12 years now and will continue... don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, the first time was on a home shopping network when they carried it. All it takes is one or two coats and your nails are transformed into something neat and manicured like. I get compliments on my nails whenever I wear this and the natural light really intensifies the color.I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive and prone to stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;If you like the look of a french manicure but don&#x27;t like wearing acrylics then use this.</li>
    <li> Excellent nail polish very natural</li>
    <li> I bought this and tried it expecting the best but it&#x27;s just expensive clear coat. Don&#x27;t expect to be amazed. The company I got it from charged 6 bucks to ship it and it took over 2 weeks to arrive. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I could only give it two stars because it starts chipping 2 days after applying it.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if I put one , two, or three coats on my nails.  It chips very badly.</li>
    <li> I would give this 10 stars if I could!  This is the BEST polish I have Ever used!  I do my own nails and have never been to a nail saloon before but this polish looks like I did.  And it last forever!  Delivery was fast too!</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes your nails look so shiny, clean, bright and healthy.  However, I do find that it chips of VERY easily.  I wish it lasted longer than a couple of days.  Other than that it is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> its the same idea as bluing that our grandparents (or great grandparents) did to get their whites white... blue tint makes white look whiter.  This is a clear coat with a slightly blue tinge which makes the white part of your nails look a bit whiter.  Nothing too special.  I like it, it wasn&#x27;t too expensive. Something a bit different than a regular clear coat....</li>
    <li> Makes my nails look healthy and well kept. I would not say it looks like a French manicure but it does make the pinks pinker and the whites whiter.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this product is amazing.  It does pink your nails up and brighten the look of your tips.  Makes my nails look clean and healthy!  I love it.</li>
    <li> This did not provide a French manicure look.  Kind of looks like glowing creamy color.  Afraid of what&#x27;s in it since it dried out my nails pretty badly.  It did make them look somewhat neat, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Really like this polish.  It is natural without containing toxic formaldehyde.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  Seems to be very long wearing.  Also, my nails are healthy and happy since I&#x27;ve been using Zeva Nail Bright.  I like the subtle pinky color on my nail beds and the subtle white color on my nail tips.  Been using it for several years and have given several bottles away as gifts.  Communication was very prompt and positive with the company.  What more could I ask for?  Thank you, Zeva Nails!!</li>
    <li> this is not your ordinary nail polish.  The look is really beautiful.  It is a good, high quality polish.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to find on A.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish  Highly recommend  Gives nails a clean healthy look. I will be getting more as needed. Buy!!!</li>
    <li> Together with the cleaning bubbles product, this polish will make your nails look lovely. It has just a slight hint of blue that complements the whiteness of the nails achieved by the cleaning bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Minnesota company with an awesome product.</li>
    <li> Far better than ordinary clear polish.  It stays on for a long time.  It even feels different than regular polish. I just use one coat. It really makes my nails look heathy.  It is expensive, but definitely worth it. It will last a long time since you only need one coat for a perfect look.</li>
    <li> I expected more from this polish. Yes it makes your nails brighter for about 2 days &amp; then it starts to turn yellow.</li>
    <li> The polish seemed like any other clear coat, until a couple days after application when it turned yellow. My nails were still stained after I removed the polish.</li>
    <li> does not seem to create a french tip if that was the intention, but as a cover it is excellent</li>
    <li> Every nail tech in the world needs this product,just saying!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago from TV and it is by far the BEST thing I have ever gotten. It does exactly what it says. I keep my nails very short and this stuff makes them look professionally done without the cost. Great product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. It&#x27;s expensive, right? But it is totally worth it. It doesn&#x27;t look like a French manicure when you put it on, because come on. If you expect a French manicure with a bottle of clear polish you are naive. What it does is put on a very clean looking clear coat that doesn&#x27;t look yellow and brightens up the white part of your nail. It is perfect for when you need your nails to look well-groomed but you don&#x27;t have time for the nail salon. I have bought this for several of my friends as gifts. They also include some nail cleaning accessories as a bonus. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s much different than other topcoats.</li>
    <li> French, not so much, but nice polish to the color.  Glad I did it.</li>
    <li> Awesome nail polish.  Makes your nails look so neat and clean and also gives that illusion of a French manicure.  I use it weekly on my fingernails and every 2 weeks on my toes.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Received it fast.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product and it did as stated.</li>
    <li> I have used Zeva&#x27;s Nail Bright since 1995. It is the best, longest lasting, most natural looking polish I have ever used.  The &amp;#34;one-step&amp;#34; application is super easy and the polish does not contain any harmful ingredients.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I work in Healthcare and I have a thyroid condition, both of which mean I have NEVER had nice looking natural nails. I can&#x27;t wear colored polish or acrylics due to my work and I wash my hands a million times a day and regularly slather on alcohol based hand sanitizer and conventional polish begins to chip within 24 hours. I decided to try Zeva nails after reading the reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I did! This stuff is a miracle! It covers ridges nicely and has a beautiful buffed shine finish. On me, it adds a tiny bit of a bluish tint so my pinks look more pink and distinctively different than before, the natural &amp;#34;french manicure&amp;#34; look that is discussed. I really like it! In the direct sunlight, it&#x27;s even brighter and looks so cool! It wears like IRON! I have used it once a week since I got it but recently went 3 weeks between redoing my manicure and it still looked pretty dang good. I strongly recommend this to others who want professional, well manicured looking hands without the fuss or expense of traditional manicures. Along with the cuticle oil pen and the nail bright soak, my nails have never looked better! Thanks, Zeva Nails!</li>
    <li> I have been using this polish for years.  Ever since it was on QVC, then sadly they stopped carrying it.  What I of love about this clear polish is that it pink-ens up your nails and whitens your tips, almost making the appearance of a French manicure.  Its really just a nice look and even though it looks clear, in the sun outside its totally different.  This is my go to polish when I just want quick and easy and out the door and my nails to look clean and nice without having to use a color that takes way too long to dry.  I literally slap the stuff on and in minutes it is dry..I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> Zeva Nail Bright is OK, but you can only tell its on in the sunshine.  Then your nails look kind of bluish pink.  Indoors, it just looks clear.  Not nearly like a French manicure.</li>
    <li> Bought this years ago through mail. Was glad to see they still made this. Leaves nails very natural pink and brings out the whiteness of the tips. Don&#x27;t know how this happens, but it does. I love soft looking natural nails, and this does it.  My hands and nails need some help. This makes them look attractive.  My husband even commented.</li>
    <li> I read reviews before buying this product and decided to take a risk but unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t impressed.&lt;br /&gt;As some girls said here , it does look shiny and noticeable outside during the daylight but you can&#x27;t see the transformation at home, it looks just like a transparent polish. And also, as for me, didn&#x27;t work at all the white moment , nails look the same transparent white as before.&lt;br /&gt;Good moment that it doesn&#x27;t have bad ingredients as usual nails.</li>
    <li> Was as described.  Will order gain</li>
    <li> I bought this nail polish because it had great reviews, I&#x27;m so glad that I did, I absolutely love it. It makes your nail bed pink and the tips look whiter and definitely brighter. Plus it doesn&#x27;t have all those bad chemicals like most of the other nail polishes out on the market. It&#x27;s not exactly a French manicure but it comes very very close to that, I love it. If you like the look of natural nails, this will take your natural look to the next level, in other words your nails will look very natural yet more beautiful than natural. Again, it make makes  your nail bed pinker and it whitens and brightens your nail tips and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed my Zeva Nail Bright.  It does as it says and my nails always look finished.  Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> To the best of knowledge I don&#x27;t remember how many bottles I have purchased.  Due to the fact that it works so well that I keep giving mine away to friends and have to order more for myself.  It goes on clear so it is error proof.  It makes the white look whiter and the pink look pinker.  It even looks great on your toes.  Not mentioning the fact the it has made my nails strong! Most people think my nails are fake, but they are Zeva made possible nails.  I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love this. exactly as described by the seller</li>
    <li> 1. Makes an unpolished nail look great fast!&lt;br /&gt;2. Applied over a professional gel polish french manicure, nail maintain&#x27;s its brilliance and hardness for several months.  YES! I apply Zeva Nail Bright every 7-10 days and my $55.00 manicure remains undamaged and looking great.  If I do use a color polish, I bring my own polish for the professional manicure so that I can cover the outgrow prior to applying Zeva Nail Bright as it is long lasting and  &amp;#34;finishes&amp;#34; any nail beautifully.</li>
    <li> Liked the polish. Arrived in a timely basis &amp; with free Ziva cleaning bubbles.  Used &amp; liked.  Usually cannot wear clear because my nails have a yellowish tone.  After this polish, that wasn&#x27;t the problem.  Had a clear lavender like color.  Wouldn&#x27;t say it was french manicure but no longer had the yellowish tone to my nails.  Dried quicker than I anticipated.  Really liked the polish &amp; would have given 5 stars if it was more like french manicure.</li>
    <li> Like the way the polish gives a clean look to my nails.  Does nothing to help them grow or strengthen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since I first saw it on QVC years ago.  They stopped carrying it so I started ordering it elsewhere.  It doesn&#x27;t look like a french manicure with bright white tips but it does make your natural nails look very nice.  It makes the nail bed a slight pink and the tips whiter.  I love it and will continue using it as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> First I used this on my natural nails and I was amazed at the beautiful French manicure that resulted.  Then I used it on acrylic nails and they came out looking like natural nails!  A curiously useful &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34;  for the gal on the go or a quick date. Removes easily with regular non-acetone polish remover.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product through QVC, and unfortunately&lt;br /&gt;they stopped selling, it really works, and makes your nails&lt;br /&gt;look like a french manicure.</li>
    <li> It works like a clear nail polish. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, I mean really a 1-Step French for $15? My observation is that my nails look fantastic.  It totally &amp;#34;pinked&amp;#34; my nailbeds, but not in a weird way and also made my tips brighter. It is not a dramatic change, but enough that I would totally repurchase. It looks like something is on, but not exactly sure what. Great.</li>
    <li> Have ordered this twice now.  I like it, it does brighten up your nails.</li>
    <li> I love this nail brightener, but it only \\&quot;lasts\\&quot;1-2 days tops. Having to remove the old so often, it&#x27;s drying out my cuticles. Maybe it&#x27;s just my nails(?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************************additional note to my review:&lt;br /&gt;This company truly cares about customers being happy with their product.  I&#x27;m sure that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but they attempt to make everyone happy, no matter what.  I appreciate that level of customer service.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.....there&#x27;s no way to lose with the care the company gives if it doesn&#x27;t work \\&quot;just right\\&quot; for your nails.  Kudos to company!&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************************</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but after reading other reviews and the 100 percent satisfaction guarantee I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Product does exactly what it claims to do. It produces an instant French manicure. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years, and I am only on my second bottle.  It is an office staple as we can quickly get a well groomed look in about 30 seconds by applying this product.  It dries in a flash and makes your nails look soooooooo healthy and clean and brite.  The name is appropriate for the product. It lasts forever and does not go bad like regular nail polish.  Highly recommended for healthy nails in a flash.</li>
    <li> This polish looks really great for a couple of days. After wearing it for two days it starts turning a yellow-ish color.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail brightener I have ever used. I purchased two bottles. I have tried many of the brighteners on the market today, and this beats all of them. It wears superbly and does not chip or peel. I will purchase this again and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using zeva nail bright for many years, first seeing it on QVC.  It is the only polish that keeps my nail looking good and keeps them from breaking.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> This product is very good.  It goes on smooth, and last. I put two thin layers on not one thick one.  I have been wearing since I recieved almost 1 week and no chips, peeling ect.  It is a little pricy but seems to wear a long time. It is a quality nail polish.  They did send me a free sample of nail bubbles for cleaning nails with purchase which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Do no expect your nail tips to be bright white like it would be if you have an actual French Manicure.  I have used similar product before and knew what to expect so I was completly satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product gives your nails a mirror like shine which lasts over a week without chipping. The sheen makes your nails look longer than they really are.  Speedy shipping too!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It really makes your nail beds look healthy!</li>
    <li> Definitely makes your nails whiter, but i wish it made them stronger too.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and packed very well. However, my hopes were high after reading these reviews. I see absolutely no difference between this polish and standard clear nail polish -- except the price.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; polish is not simply clear:  it has the effect of making your nails look somewhat pink in a very natural way.  So if your nails are discolored from wearing other polish, it will help make them look healthy again and attractive.  There are other brands that make this type of polish but they have phthalates or parabens in them and have a very heavy odor that takes at least 24 hours to dissipate whereas this polish has none of that.  I really like it and wear it most of the time as my first choice for my own home manicures.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product the 1st time on a popular television shopping channel. It lasted forever. It was in a brown bottle at the time. When I went back to purchase more, they no longer had it and I was so disappointed. It took me a while, but I finally thought to look on line for it and found it at Amazon.com. The ladies that say they can&#x27;t tell any difference must not have looked at thier hands like in a mall store (Flourescent Lights) or outside in the natural sunlight. I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference in my home, but when I go to the stores, the hospital, even out to talk to a neighbor, I get compliments all the time and am asked what do I use. I only use one coat and I am all about some low maintenance. This is as low a maintenance as you can get. I love the product. I hope they never stop making it. You just have to check it out outside or in flourescent lights. For fun, look at it under tanning lights.... It does work!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zeva nails religiously for many years, and I always get compliments on how beautiful my nails look.  The product makes my nails stronger.  The product is very fast drying and can be done quicly before walking out the door. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Nail Bright. They guarantee it because it works. I love how it looks, the nail beds are more pink and the tips more white. Being a Holistic Nurse, I especially like that there&#x27;s no formeldahyde in it.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Zeva Nail Bright!!!!!  I cannot imagine using anything else now that I have been using Zeva Nail Bright!!  I have been polishing my nails for a LOT of years and have tried just about every product and this is hands down the BEST.  My nails are fairly long and have always looked a little yellow in color, which is why I was using colored nail polish to disguise the ugly yellow, but now, they look healthy and a whole lot whiter  : )  It IS certainly worth every penny!!!  LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the natural finish of this product. Looks like clean, healthy nails that have been buffed to perfection. Great undone look.</li>
    <li> This Zeva Nail Bright give the closest to a  french manicure that I can imagine.  I start by completely brush cleaning my nails with whitening toothpaste to get the tips as clean as possible  I apply one coat each of Quimica Alemana and Essie Mademoiselle, then one coat of the Zeva .  The big tip is to allow one day of drying between coats.  (A complete pain, I know, but my manicures really do last one full week and more).  That&#x27;s it, except be sure you are frequently apply some sort of oil to your cuticles a couple of times daily.  Using this regimen, my nails look professionally done and are almost as striking as a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; french mani!</li>
    <li> Delighted to rediscover this product. I used it regularly many years ago and loved it.....and I still do! If you like your nails to look natural, yet manicured, but haven&#x27;t the time or the money to spend at a nail salon -- or simply don&#x27;t care to risk nail infections at a salon -- then this is a product you should try.  It&#x27;s quick and effective!</li>
    <li> I have been using Zeva since it was sold on QVC.  Don&#x27;t expect it to look like the french manicure from the salon.  It pinks up your nail beds and makes the tips look whiter. If you put on more than one coat, the effect is more noticeable.  Although it is pricey, it lasts a long time.  The polish doesn&#x27;t dry out or get all gunky in the bottle.  It gives your nails nice shine and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zeva Nail Bright for several years, found it first on QVC, but the Q quit carrying the product, so I searched the internet and finally found their company and location and called them directly to order more.  Now I found them on Amazon.com....the product is awesome, absolutely love it, get lots of compliments on my nails, but most important to me, it&#x27;s Formaldehyde free, I have an allergy to anything with Formaldehyde (which, by the way is used in embalming fluid when we die) just thought you&#x27;d like to know, it&#x27;s a preservative, and totally unnecessary in all the products it&#x27;s being put in today.  I hope the company who makes Zeva never quits offering the product, but would like the bottle to be bigger.  Really happy to find it, will continue to order.</li>
    <li> that exactly what I was looking for a long time</li>
    <li> It does not make much of a difference.  After a while, I decided to apply two coats.  It seemed the same.  This make a nice clear polish, though.  I am going to buy their file next, it has great reviews.  (There is another product called TRIND that I want to try by a different company.)sfaction.)</li>
    <li> How they come about marketing this as a &amp;#34;one step french manicure&amp;#34; is beyond me.  I&#x27;m not even sure how they ever got the idea. This stuff is a peculiar lavender color after it dries that if anything makes one&#x27;s nails look as though they&#x27;re experiencing oxygen deprivation. There&#x27;s certainly nothing &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; about it, other than that it has a weird, unnatural iridescent quality. Wish I could return it, so am trashing it instead.</li>
    <li> This is the only clear polish I use on my nails.  I get compliments all the time.  It makes my natural nails look better especially when I am outside in the sun.</li>
    <li> I tried Pink Armor and LOVED the look.  But then my nails started peeling and coming apart and I found that it contains formaldehyde.  I found Zeva Nail Bright and decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s a winner.  Easy to apply.  Dries fairly quickly.  Nice healthy look.  No formaldehyde!</li>
    <li> Yes - it made my nails brighter after 2 applications (I wear dark polish a lot).....but, I tried Yello-Out for about a third of the price and it worked just as good if not better.  I used to buy it awhile ago at Ulta &amp; Walgreens but haven&#x27;t seen it so I tried this.  Eh...not so much.  Going back to Yello-Out at $4.50 a bottle.  Also, I don&#x27;t agree with the french mani comparisons at all - kinda leaves an allover bluish cast, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this polish! My nails look healthy and neat. I most definitely will be a repeat customer. My tips whitened and the nail beds pinked.</li>
    <li> it is the best i have used on my nails and they are getting even better as i use it. will not go without it.</li>
    <li> I just don t seem to have the Time to let this fully dry.  If you do buy it.  If you are going to use it alone. Buy it</li>
    <li> it does what it says.</li>
