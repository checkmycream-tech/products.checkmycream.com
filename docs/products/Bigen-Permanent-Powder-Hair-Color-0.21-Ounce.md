### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>Best wishes!</li>
      <li>Bigen permanent powder is the perfect solution!  </li>
      <li>I used it just for my roots in between dye jobs and it worked great.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering this great hair dye from now on.</li>
      <li>with great hair.  </li>
      <li>I like it because it&#x27;s inexpensive, smells great</li>
      <li>this is a great product.</li>
      <li>All the colors are great.</li>
      <li>lol - It makes your hair a \\&quot;soft\\</li>
      <li>Use at your own risk!</li>
      <li>Good Luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That would be more ideal.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Bigen for a dozen years and have never had any skin irritation or allergic reaction of any kind.  </li>
      <li>Excellent for a busy lifestyle and living on a budget.</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s my favorite hair color, with no smelly ammonia.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.</li>
      <li>&quot; and many alternative Healthcare practitioners would tell you to avoid products with this ingredient.  </li>
      <li>But I think you&#x27;ll love the shine, rich color, and healthy texture if you use the lighter colors and dilute them!  </li>
      <li>Plus your porous damaged hair will probably soak up more color than you&#x27;re aiming for.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, I just put it on my hair, wait 15 minutes, and rinse it out.</li>
      <li>48 hours before you color - the easy instructions tell you what to do.  </li>
      <li>I have heard that this product does not fade easily when washed</li>
      <li>After 5-6 washings the colour relaxes into a rich, warm, very lovely and natural brown...</li>
      <li>read the fine print, its not really that natural, but it its better then most.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen great results and happy people who use it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It uses mild, safe ingredients to give you what I consider a semi-permanent color.</li>
      <li>so there is no need to use special shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, be prepared for dark, intense color (beautiful but probably a shock to you and your friends)!  </li>
      <li>For me the quality colour, healthy effect on my hair, ease of use and price outweigh a week or two of intense colour.</li>
      <li>I been using Bigen Oriental Black for more then ten years (I am hispanic with curly hair) and the product has been the best to work with.</li>
      <li>Bigen reviews\\&quot; the very first one have pages of allergic reactions.)</li>
      <li>What I love most about this product is the vibrant, natural colour it gives without damaging my hair.</li>
      <li>It is more natural and doesn&#x27;t damage.</li>
      <li>For the first time, I went to ER.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not against this product, I just think you should be aware of what your getting yourself into if you choose to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>One caution:  Please use only the lightest Bigen colors (chocolate or light chestnut) - unless you want a gothic look!  </li>
      <li>(You&#x27;ll have more powder left in the bottle, so you can always color your hair again if you want to go darker!)</li>
      <li>Basically you are pretty stuck.&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; and I am not sure how good that is for you.  </li>
      <li>bottle wouldn&#x27;t cover my whole head</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Instructions say you can use it on your whole head.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen very upset girls after they tried putting dye, bleach, color remover etc, and realized that the&#x27;re stuck, either grow it out or cut it off.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>It turned out to be my favorite dye job in the end because my naturally brown hair wasn&#x27;t red or copper colored as it faded over time.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to put vaseline on top of your ears, and behind your ears before you color.</li>
      <li>The results are so glossy with rich color that no one would guess how damaged or brassy your hair was 20 minutes earlier!  </li>
      <li>Also, I don&#x27;t do anything special like use shampoo to make my dye last longer.</li>
      <li>And even the lightest Bigen colors are pretty dark (darker than what you&#x27;d normally consider light brown).</li>
      <li>It covers my grey easily and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  Months later I must admit that this hair color faded really naturally and left me with my favorite look of all hair colors.  </li>
      <li>It is much more convenient to buy this online since the local stores seem to be perpetually out of stock with this color.</li>
      <li>It is the first and ONLY hair color that didn&#x27;t go reddish with time</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve read the reviews where some people did have intense reactions, so please do the simple patch test</li>
      <li>have colored my hair for years and it seems to fade out naturally</li>
      <li>I like this product so far and have noticed that it did cover my gray peppered hair.</li>
      <li>so your natural color is not bleached out and dyed over, the natural color is still below.  </li>
      <li>sure you want to be dark, for a long while</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, only 30 minutes to set without a lot of mess and only requires a plastic bowl and water to activate.</li>
      <li>To dilute the strong color, I added about two tablespoons (yes!) of thick white conditioner.</li>
      <li>, will NOT dry my hair, and the color last quite a few months and touch ups are easy as well.</li>
      <li>Second, it isn&#x27;t natural as people seem to believe.</li>
      <li>Want to go back to your natural brown color after lightening or damaging your hair?  </li>
      <li>I constantly get compliments on my hair now and the colour is so natural no one even realised I was colouring my hair.</li>
      <li>in general dark brown hair dye has been linked to certain cancers in some articles I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
      <li>average haircolor, nothing special, I didn&#x27;t see any different in this product than what is typical on the store&#x27;s shelf.</li>
      <li>For my thick chin-length hair, I used only 1/4 or 1/3 of the powder from the Bigen bottle plus a little more water than the instructions suggested.  </li>

<li> For my thick chin-length hair, I used only 1/4 or 1/3 of the powder from the Bigen bottle plus a little more water than the instructions suggested.  </li>
<li> I use it to dye a small part of my grey hairs, it&#x27;s a quick and simple way though it won&#x27;t stay long.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like yours where it&#x27;s pretty much black but in the sun it looks dark brown with red highlights.</li>
<li> Yes bigen has long lasting results and is resistant to fading, but it comes at a cost.</li>
<li> I use this product often to cover grey spots here and there in my hair, especially around my temples.</li>
<li> &quot; black that looks natural.</li>
<li> Only one note of caution - the entire line runs dark.</li>
<li> This dye just stays in by itself with no worries for a long time; doesn&#x27;t fade just grows out.</li>
<li> , both were long time users who ignored the warning signs.</li>
<li> if you have long hair.&lt;br</li>
<li> All the grey is gone!</li>
<li> My mom found that she was hyperallergic to the substance used in Bigen &amp; switched to other hair dyes - made her break out into rashes &amp; had massive hair fall.</li>
<li> not that harsh black you see most people have - like when you picture a stereotypical white girl goth</li>
<li> I&#x27;m half Asian</li>
<li> my face and neck started hiving, then I lost my peripheral vision, my eye started to swollen and my eye was starting to shut tight as my scalp burned and itch.</li>
<li> So if it says leave on for 20 minutes, and you decide to leave it on for 45 minutes, your hair will get darker than you expected.  </li>
<li> i will always use this instead of store bought dye that stinks and is full of chemicals.</li>
<li> /&gt;Do not leave on too long and pick a color a few shades lighter than you think you need.  </li>
<li> And this product doesn&#x27;t have any peroxide or other lighteners, so you won&#x27;t continue damaging your hair as you would with typical permanent color.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Because the color was so dark I tried to lighten with all the home remedies I could find online.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re middle-aged like me, color that dark probably won&#x27;t be flattering.  </li>
<li> I have never had a product go so dark on my hair before.  </li>
<li> I use medium chestnut brown on my dark brown hair and it turns it close to chocolate black.</li>
<li> I will just process for a shorter time and use one step down in color to avoid the black look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> If any I get compliments on my deepest black curly hair.</li>
<li> This oriental black will make it all black, but</li>
<li> Medium Brown is almost Gothic Black.  </li>
<li> but I have to suffer a little darkness to get there.</li>
<li> Sometimes you can get a little skin reaction from the dye.  </li>
<li> Copper can be considered a \\&quot;Heavy</li>
<li> I have fairly short and thin hair so be warned.&lt;br</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it will even work.  </li>
<li> (Just stir thick conditioner into the powder/water mixture.)  </li>
<li> So far I have not experienced a bad side effect.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Speedy delivery. Product as advertised.</li>
    <li> Yes bigen has long lasting results and is resistant to fading, but it comes at a cost. It is a metallic hair dye. That means even bleach won&#x27;t lighten it. Your stuck with the color til it grows out. Second, it isn&#x27;t natural as people seem to believe. It has peroxide. If you read th box it says no mixing required, well that&#x27;s because the peroxide is in the mix, so that&#x27;s not much different then your boxed dye. And yes, there have been severe allergic reactions associated with this dye. I&#x27;m not against this product, I just think you should be aware of what your getting yourself into if you choose to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you want to be dark, for a long while if you have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Do an allergy test.&lt;br /&gt;And read the fine print, its not really that natural, but it its better then most.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen great results and happy people who use it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen very upset girls after they tried putting dye, bleach, color remover etc, and realized that the&#x27;re stuck, either grow it out or cut it off.&lt;br /&gt;And twice I&#x27;ve seen really gross blisters on the scalp and face, both were long time users who ignored the warning signs. Itching scalp, dry patchy scalp after use, but since they used it for years, maybe decades, they kept using it , til they had a VERY BAD reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Just be informed (:</li>
    <li> BEAWARE! I have been dying my hair for decades and never had a problem. I decided to switch to bigen because the thought of \\&quot;chemical free\\&quot; appealed to me. I had relied on amazon reviews so I decided to go with it. (PLEASE google \\&quot; Bigen reviews\\&quot; the very first one have pages of allergic reactions.) 1 day after- my face and neck started hiving, then I lost my peripheral vision, my eye started to swollen and my eye was starting to shut tight as my scalp burned and itch. For the first time, I went to ER. Im now on Prednisone, pepcid and benadryl with an eye patch.</li>
    <li> What I love most about this product is the vibrant, natural colour it gives without damaging my hair. It covers my grey easily and leaves my hair soft and shiny. It&#x27;s very easy to use, only 30 minutes to set without a lot of mess and only requires a plastic bowl and water to activate. Excellent for a busy lifestyle and living on a budget. Only one note of caution - the entire line runs dark. I use medium chestnut brown on my dark brown hair and it turns it close to chocolate black. After 5-6 washings the colour relaxes into a rich, warm, very lovely and natural brown...but I have to suffer a little darkness to get there. For me the quality colour, healthy effect on my hair, ease of use and price outweigh a week or two of intense colour. I constantly get compliments on my hair now and the colour is so natural no one even realised I was colouring my hair.</li>
    <li> Want to go back to your natural brown color after lightening or damaging your hair?  Bigen permanent powder is the perfect solution!  The results are so glossy with rich color that no one would guess how damaged or brassy your hair was 20 minutes earlier!  And this product doesn&#x27;t have any peroxide or other lighteners, so you won&#x27;t continue damaging your hair as you would with typical permanent color.  One caution:  Please use only the lightest Bigen colors (chocolate or light chestnut) - unless you want a gothic look!  And even the lightest Bigen colors are pretty dark (darker than what you&#x27;d normally consider light brown). Plus your porous damaged hair will probably soak up more color than you&#x27;re aiming for.  To dilute the strong color, I added about two tablespoons (yes!) of thick white conditioner. (Just stir thick conditioner into the powder/water mixture.)  For my thick chin-length hair, I used only 1/4 or 1/3 of the powder from the Bigen bottle plus a little more water than the instructions suggested.  Otherwise, be prepared for dark, intense color (beautiful but probably a shock to you and your friends)!  If you&#x27;re middle-aged like me, color that dark probably won&#x27;t be flattering.  But I think you&#x27;ll love the shine, rich color, and healthy texture if you use the lighter colors and dilute them!  (You&#x27;ll have more powder left in the bottle, so you can always color your hair again if you want to go darker!) I&#x27;ve used Bigen for a dozen years and have never had any skin irritation or allergic reaction of any kind.  However, I&#x27;ve read the reviews where some people did have intense reactions, so please do the simple patch test 48 hours before you color - the easy instructions tell you what to do.  Best wishes!</li>
    <li> It is more natural and doesn&#x27;t damage. I&#x27;m half Asian and I have Asianish hair. It&#x27;s like yours where it&#x27;s pretty much black but in the sun it looks dark brown with red highlights. This oriental black will make it all black, but not that harsh black you see most people have - like when you picture a stereotypical white girl goth lol - It makes your hair a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; black that looks natural. Also, I don&#x27;t do anything special like use shampoo to make my dye last longer. This dye just stays in by itself with no worries for a long time; doesn&#x27;t fade just grows out.</li>
    <li> I been using Bigen Oriental Black for more then ten years (I am hispanic with curly hair) and the product has been the best to work with. I like it because it&#x27;s inexpensive, smells great, will NOT dry my hair, and the color last quite a few months and touch ups are easy as well. So far I have not experienced a bad side effect. If any I get compliments on my deepest black curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast delivery. I will be ordering this great hair dye from now on. Thank you. All the grey is gone!</li>
    <li> I used it just for my roots in between dye jobs and it worked great.</li>
    <li> I like this product so far and have noticed that it did cover my gray peppered hair.</li>
    <li> I use it to dye a small part of my grey hairs, it&#x27;s a quick and simple way though it won&#x27;t stay long.</li>
    <li> I remember Bigen from what my parents used in the 80&#x27;s. My mom found that she was hyperallergic to the substance used in Bigen &amp; switched to other hair dyes - made her break out into rashes &amp; had massive hair fall. Use at your own risk!</li>
    <li> I use this product often to cover grey spots here and there in my hair, especially around my temples. It uses mild, safe ingredients to give you what I consider a semi-permanent color. I only have to redo it every month or two. Easy to use, I just put it on my hair, wait 15 minutes, and rinse it out. I can actually do it at the last minute, and be on my way out the door within 30 min. with great hair.  Instructions say you can use it on your whole head.  Never have.  But I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. i will always use this instead of store bought dye that stinks and is full of chemicals. pro hairstylists suggest this to avoid damaging your hair.</li>
    <li> average haircolor, nothing special, I didn&#x27;t see any different in this product than what is typical on the store&#x27;s shelf.</li>
    <li> I have never had a product go so dark on my hair before.  Medium Brown is almost Gothic Black.  I have since read that you need to go with a lighter color because they tend to go black.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle wouldn&#x27;t cover my whole head so I had to redye the next day to finish the job.  I have fairly short and thin hair so be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the color was so dark I tried to lighten with all the home remedies I could find online. The color would not budge.  I have heard that this product does not fade easily when washed so there is no need to use special shampoo.  I have also read that it is not affected by things like \\&quot;Color Oops\\&quot; that will take your hair dye out.  Basically you are pretty stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have colored my hair for years and it seems to fade out naturally and my roots don&#x27;t show too badly.  I am afraid I am stuck since I have med brown hair that is now dyed black.  I will probably have to go in and get highlights but I&#x27;m not sure if it will even work.  Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not leave on too long and pick a color a few shades lighter than you think you need.  Good Luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Months later I must admit that this hair color faded really naturally and left me with my favorite look of all hair colors.  I think it is because there is no Ammonia so your natural color is not bleached out and dyed over, the natural color is still below.  It turned out to be my favorite dye job in the end because my naturally brown hair wasn&#x27;t red or copper colored as it faded over time.  It is the first and ONLY hair color that didn&#x27;t go reddish with time and I may just use it again.  I will just process for a shorter time and use one step down in color to avoid the black look.&lt;br /&gt;I believe this product is a \\&quot;Cooper Salt\\&quot; and I am not sure how good that is for you.  Copper can be considered a \\&quot;Heavy Metal\\&quot; and many alternative Healthcare practitioners would tell you to avoid products with this ingredient.  I can&#x27;t find enough information about \\&quot;Metallic Salts\\&quot; and their health implications but in general dark brown hair dye has been linked to certain cancers in some articles I&#x27;ve read.  Just something to check into.  I wish there was a way to get it on without it sitting on the scalp.  That would be more ideal.</li>
    <li> It is much more convenient to buy this online since the local stores seem to be perpetually out of stock with this color.</li>
    <li> All the colors are great. The longer you leave it on, the darker it gets.  So if it says leave on for 20 minutes, and you decide to leave it on for 45 minutes, your hair will get darker than you expected.  Just know that.  Be sure to put vaseline on top of your ears, and behind your ears before you color. Sometimes you can get a little skin reaction from the dye.  All in all, it&#x27;s my favorite hair color, with no smelly ammonia.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that keeps my stubborn gray hairs colored for any length of time. Great product!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
