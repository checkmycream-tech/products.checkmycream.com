      <li>Smell is not overbearing, so you can use your favorite moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It has the most silky, creamy  feel of any skin lotion I&#x27;ve used -- and</li>
      <li>This is a favorite of my granddaughter&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Sadly, most of them just aren&#x27;t as appealing.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s a bubblebath that will have you screaming for more....</li>
      <li>what more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Egg Nog, which I like better.  </li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>I love how it treats my skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been in love with the cinnamon buns shower gel by Philosophy for about a decade now, and every time there is a new scent added to the line I try it with the hopes that it will be as good.</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>Treat yourself to a fine experience.</li>
      <li>It smells like the cheap vanilla-scented body wash you can buy at the dollar store.</li>
      <li>Anyone would enjoy this vanilla treat.</li>
      <li>Especially for men, kids these scents are a welcome start to any day.</li>
      <li>But I have no problems with the rich lather.  </li>
      <li>and you feel clean after using.</li>
      <li>I like the rich lather of this product, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Plus, they advertise exactly how to make it on the bottle!</li>
      <li>After showing, I felt super clean and refreshed; my skin felt very hydrated too.</li>
      <li>after I shower, so fresh and rejuvenated, is worth the price.</li>
      <li>Is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>This shower gel has a yummy, fresh scent but is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Love that you still have the same formula from Philosophy.</li>
      <li>As with all the Philosophy gels I&#x27;ve tried it makes my skin feel clean and soft.</li>
      <li>This is my first time writing a review, but I felt compelled due to my love for this Philosophy product.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>so I say yes because as a shower gel it lathers very well</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this scent, but I just didn&#x27;t, and I find myself not really wanting to use it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ok with a soft scent as long as it lingers awhile</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>definitely worth the extra cost -- compared to any drugstore skin lotions.</li>
      <li>This is one skin product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>I cannot live without this, I swear.</li>
      <li>When it finally ran out, I splurged on a large bottle of it.</li>
      <li>Will buy again and use frequently.</li>

    <li> i smell like cake mix haha i love it, i dont give the product five stars because it began to cloy me a little bit</li>
    <li> I like the rich lather of this product, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.  I&#x27;ve used the Egg Nog, which I like better.  Next time I&#x27;ll either buy that one again or try something different.  But I have no problems with the rich lather.  I use this in the shower as shampoo and shower gel.</li>
    <li> This shower gel has a yummy, fresh scent but is not overpowering. As with all the Philosophy gels I&#x27;ve tried it makes my skin feel clean and soft. It arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and the scent remains on your skin for a long time.  The soap lathers quite well so this will last for awhile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with the cinnamon buns shower gel by Philosophy for about a decade now, and every time there is a new scent added to the line I try it with the hopes that it will be as good. Sadly, most of them just aren&#x27;t as appealing. I really wanted to love this scent, but I just didn&#x27;t, and I find myself not really wanting to use it.

    <li> item smells great and lathers well.not my favorite but liked the frosted cookie better.&lt;br /&gt;tried many others this one is good but like the cookie scents the best</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Delightful scent and wonderful creamy texture! Anyone would enjoy this vanilla treat. Thank You, Vivian</li>
    <li> Love that you still have the same formula from Philosophy. Will be ordering more soon. The newer formula from Coty is terrible.</li>
    <li> Great smell and easy for my kid to use as it&#x27;s shampoo and body wash!</li>
    <li> This is a favorite of my granddaughter&#x27;s.  She asked for it for Christmas and I couldn&#x27;t find it locally so instead of running around everywhere hunting for it, I order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have you smelled this stuff?! Best smelling body wash ever! Plus, they advertise exactly how to make it on the bottle! All that writing below the name is the ingredients and the instructions how to make it. Totally awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the way this smells and makes me feel after I shower, so fresh and rejuvenated, is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love the Philosophy shower gels!</li>
    <li> Yes and no.  I have only used as a shower gel so I say yes because as a shower gel it lathers very well and you feel clean after using. I say no because I personally like a lot of scent.  I&#x27;m ok with a soft scent as long as it lingers awhile and I&#x27;ve noticed that no sooner than 10 minutes after use the scent is gone.</li>
    <li> I  liked  just  a  little  to  pricey !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this. It smells so nice, so yummy. It&#x27;s a little expensive but it&#x27;s okay. I cannot live without this, I swear.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers a shower wash for that all-over cleaning head to toe.  The 3-in-1 is perfect for him.  Vanilla is the only fragrance he won&#x27;t complain about........this being one of 3 vanilla fragrances we have used.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a bubblebath that will have you screaming for more....we all scream for vanilla bean ice-cream!! Delicious aroma, but no calories to worry about! Treat yourself to a fine experience.</li>
    <li> Excellent for travel.  Shampoo and body wash.  Skin feels great and smells delicious.  Will buy again and use frequently. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with French Vanilla!!  She loves it too as she has had it before.</li>
    <li> Philosophy has the best product for head to toe in the shower and bath! Get any flavor you like and use it in place of any shampoo you currently use. Especially for men, kids these scents are a welcome start to any day. A little goes a long way. Use half vanilla and half any berry or baked flavor for another scent twist.</li>
    <li> It smells great and feels silky, love it! Is worth every penny. AND It smells like vanilla bean ice cream</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It has a wonderful vanilla scent. I use only Philosophy body wash and although I don&#x27;t use it as a shampoo on a regular basis, I have used it as a shampoo when I travel so I only have to carry one item. I recommend this product all the time.</li>
    <li> I frickin love this stuff! I bought for a shampoo alternative but you can bathe with it too! Don&#x27;t use it often though, it&#x27;ll irritate your skin; just like it states on the bottle. Smell is not overbearing, so you can use your favorite moisturizer. Just makes for a devine bathing experience! So try it!</li>
    <li> This is my first time writing a review, but I felt compelled due to my love for this Philosophy product. The smell, the texture, the freshness and more are all outstanding. I used the product as a body wash and found the &#x27;bubble&#x27; effect to be great. After showing, I felt super clean and refreshed; my skin felt very hydrated too. The smell is probably the best part. It&#x27;s like vanilla birthday cake in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I never would have thought of buying a Philosophy product if I didn&#x27;t receive a small bottle as a gift. It has the most silky, creamy  feel of any skin lotion I&#x27;ve used -- and definitely worth the extra cost -- compared to any drugstore skin lotions. Because I wanted it to last as long as possible I only used that small bottle to shave my legs. When it finally ran out, I splurged on a large bottle of it. Now I can use it to wash all over and have even found it to be an excellent shampoo. I wish it was also a moisturizer so I didn&#x27;t have to wash it off. This is one skin product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> come on....the name alone says it all.....its fresh and clean.....and yummy!!!  what more can you ask for?</li>
