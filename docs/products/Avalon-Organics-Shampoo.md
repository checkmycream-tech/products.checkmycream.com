      <li>It leave my hair squeaky clean and super shiny.</li>
      <li>so I was pleased when this product really did how it was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>i never use conditioner, and my hair came out smelling lemoney fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>The smell is great and it does not burn your scalp or face if it runs down.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for my oily hair, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh new packaging, too.</li>
      <li>In search of a more natural clarifying shampoo and conditioner, I came across this product.</li>
      <li>Smells like fresh squeezed lemons.  </li>
      <li>Preferring a more natural remedy, I tried a soapnut shampoo and an apple cider vinegar rinse for weeks.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel so soft and manageable</li>
      <li>The lemon scent is fresh, just like the old &#x27;Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon&#x27; cologne from the 70s.</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo to try as a natural alternative to the more chemical-laden brands.</li>
      <li>after the first wash, there is the squeaky clean sound, but after the 2nd washing it was very clean and smelled so fresh.  </li>
      <li>It still does dry out a bit, but better than than an oily scalp full of product!</li>
      <li>The scent is barely noticeable, which is okay,</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shampoo two days in a row, and on the second day, my hair looks and feels even better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shampoo two days in a row, and on the second day, my hair looks and feels even better.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells good, cleans well &amp; isn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
      <li>My new order hasn&#x27;t arrived yet but as this is the only shampoo I use I expect it to be as great as the last time I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I would have given 5 stars but it is a bit drying, the first time I used too much</li>
      <li>It is a bit more expensive than some shampoo but &#x27;cleanly&#x27; works better than anything I have used before.</li>
      <li>After the birth of my second child, my fine hair was oilier than when I was a teenager.  </li>
      <li>I had used Avalon Organics Lemon Shampoo in the past and I loved the way it left my hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>I am very fussy about shampoo</li>
      <li>It cleans really well and does not leave my hair greasy afterwards.</li>
      <li>and it really gets your scalp and hair</li>
      <li>After losing three whole bottles--and cleaning up the resulting mess--I gave up and canceled.</li>
      <li>I really wish they could solve this problem.</li>
      <li>i really like this shampoo because i have oily hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;It had been such a long time since I used the Lemon shampoo, that I&#x27;d forgotten how nice the smell</li>
      <li>Sure you see many of the same ingredients but they are distributed in different locations on the bottle which I assume means the amount of each has changed as well as all the other added/removed ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recently purchased my next set and noticed the shampoo wasn&#x27;t lathering like I&#x27;m used to, and the conditioner felt more chalky than normal.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair but found I only need about 2 quarter coins worth to get it to work.</li>
      <li>Within a couple of days of ceasing use of the product, my scalp returned to normal.</li>
      <li>I tend to shampoo 2-3 times a week as we live in a low-water area.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and scalp</li>
      <li>All Natural, too!</li>
      <li>I found myself having to shampoo my hair two or three times to make it feel and look as clean as with my previous natural shampoo (Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s)after one wash.</li>
      <li>My old shampoo was reformulated and no longer cleaning my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>My husband asked for a suggestion at our local Whole Foods and ended up buying me this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Before finding it, I had trouble finding a shampoo that will make my curly hear clean without creating build ups.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product especially if you can&#x27;t get the Pantene Clarifying.</li>
      <li>Smells just like lemons- hair does feel much cleaner than washing it with standard commercial shampoos.</li>
      <li>unlike other reviews, i found this to be gentle on my hair and did not dry it out.  </li>
      <li>Something changed about this shampoo, it used to be a better, thicker white substance, now it&#x27;s thin &amp; opaque.  </li>
      <li>I use the same shampoo and conditioner five days a week (I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because I have a super dry scalp and it gets tight and itchy).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this one. It&#x27;s good for my oily hair, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out. The scent is barely noticeable, which is okay, I guess. I prefer the rosemary scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to try as a natural alternative to the more chemical-laden brands. I have waist-length, thick, wavy hair. I found myself having to shampoo my hair two or three times to make it feel and look as clean as with my previous natural shampoo (Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s)after one wash. I tend to shampoo 2-3 times a week as we live in a low-water area. I do not have coarse hair or greasy scalp. The shampoo also started to develop a strange odor after about six weeks. However, the lemon helped to brighten my naturally blond locks and until it went bad, has a wonderfully fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It leave my hair squeaky clean and super shiny.</li>
    <li> unlike other reviews, i found this to be gentle on my hair and did not dry it out.  i never use conditioner, and my hair came out smelling lemoney fresh and clean.  i really like this shampoo because i have oily hair and it really helps to keep it nice and clean.  if your hair is oily, i would recommend this product and this is the best price i have found for it.</li>
    <li> I use the same shampoo and conditioner five days a week (I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because I have a super dry scalp and it gets tight and itchy).  But after a few weeks of this, my hair starts to look dull.  Not even a generous dollop of conditioner can make the shine come back.  A&lt;br /&gt;fter five weeks, the bounce was gone and my hair was looking noticeably thinner, why did I wait five weeks?  Because I&#x27;m lazy and once I get into the shower, the hot water is so relaxing, it&#x27;s a stretch to remember to wash my hair, much less, use an alternate shampoo.  Plus, this yukking of my hair is a gradual process, so it wasn&#x27;t until three months had passed that I was trying to style my hair and threw my hands up in annoyance, my hair looked awful and was limp as a used tissue, worse, I wasn&#x27;t sure what I could do to fix it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I realized I probably had shampoo buildup, so I rushed out to buy a bottle of Avalon Organics Lemon Shampoo (someone had used all the shampoo, refilled the bottle with water and left it on the shower shelf, the nasty little such and such!) anyways, my usual store was out, all they had was Avalon Lavender Shampoo, I loathe the smell of lavender, plus it gives me a nasty headache/itchy throat/ watery eyes, so I came online to buy it on Amazon.  Oh the waiting was terrible, but not too long, just a couple of days, Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had been such a long time since I used the Lemon shampoo, that I&#x27;d forgotten how nice the smell was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t buy this for the natural lemon scent, although I do have a problem with perfumes, so I usually buy unscented everything, even trash bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy this shampoo because with just one wash it made my  hair shiny and swingy again.  My hair is dark, almost black and when it got shampoo buildup, the color started to turn kind of ash-y and stringy.  But after one wash it looked normal again and it felt nice too, smooth, shiny and running my fingers through it wasn&#x27;t a snagworthy event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shampoo two days in a row, and on the second day, my hair looks and feels even better.  I didn&#x27;t even style it or dry it, I gathered it into a ponytail because I was running late (like usual) and stuffed it under a bicycle helmet and three hours later it wasn&#x27;t even frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not planning on using this shampoo every day, probably just once every six or seven washes to keep my hair from getting so manky and unmanageable.ent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shampoo two days in a row, and on the second day, my hair looks and feels even better.

    <li> favorite. you do need extra to lather</li>
    <li> This shampoo is especially great if you tend to sweat and have oily or greasey hair.  Use once or at most twice a week and it really gets your scalp and hair squeaky clean.  The smell is great and it does not burn your scalp or face if it runs down.  I have very sensitive skin and scalp and this is just wonderful for a super clean feeling without stripping your hair.  Since I also color my hair this is important.  It does not seem to strip out the color but does clean.  I highly recommend this product especially if you can&#x27;t get the Pantene Clarifying.</li>
    <li> Used to be the absolute best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I recently purchased my next set and noticed the shampoo wasn&#x27;t lathering like I&#x27;m used to, and the conditioner felt more chalky than normal. Whatever, I must be tripping - I thought. But over the last two weeks my hair has become brittle, dry and frizzy. I&#x27;ve never had that happen with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared my previous bottles (2009 date) with my current ones (2012 date) - low and behold the formula has drastically changed. Sure you see many of the same ingredients but they are distributed in different locations on the bottle which I assume means the amount of each has changed as well as all the other added/removed ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad. I&#x27;m done. Guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board for another non-animal testing, somewhat organic hair line. Ugh 😖</li>
    <li> In search of a more natural clarifying shampoo and conditioner, I came across this product. Because of the many positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent and its performance. It helps get rid of any buildup and leaves my hair clean! Works even better when paired with the conditioner. The scent dissipates so it won&#x27;t conflict with your scented lotions or perfumes. I gave it a 4 because it&#x27;s a bit heavy but that&#x27;s tolerable, so I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Degreasing effect is good, suitable for summer use, please the delivery time can screw the bottle cap tight.</li>
    <li> I buy this shampoo on Amazon and other places frequently.  The Lemon has an amazing smell and my hair always feels super clean after use.  I recommend using this shampoo once or twice a week in the place of regular shampoo.  It is an amazing cleanser.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer stated, the formula for this shampoo changed (maybe a year ago?).  I also wrote the company (complaining) and was told that they had to change the formula in order to call it organic.  I don&#x27;t know if the requirements changed or they were not compliant to start with, but they should have changed the label rather than the shampoo!  It used to be great- now it&#x27;s horrible.  Same thing for their grapefruit shower gel and their Vitamin C facial cream.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful shampoo. Great for kids bubble bath, too. Smells wonderful and suds up great. All Natural, too! No chemical in this shampoo. Leaves my hair silky soft and smells WONDERFUL, like lemongrass! I will never use another shampoo. I have been purchasing this shampoo for years! Love the fresh new packaging, too. A+</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Before finding it, I had trouble finding a shampoo that will make my curly hear clean without creating build ups. This product is just great for that. I pair it with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo just as it is. I heard that they are changing the formula and adding more oil. I hope you don&#x27;t change it because this is my absolute favorite shampoo ever!! Please keep it the same.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner set. It feels good on my hair and smells good too! The conditioner is nice as well.</li>
    <li> Very deep cleaning shampoo.  That&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> My new order hasn&#x27;t arrived yet but as this is the only shampoo I use I expect it to be as great as the last time I ordered it. I would recommend it to everyone who loves a &amp;#34;Lemon&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
    <li> Shampoos from amazon usually arrive with leakage &amp; loose caps.  I really wish they could solve this problem. This shampoo smells good, cleans well &amp; isn&#x27;t harsh. There&#x27;s always the risk that leakage will eliminate cost savings.</li>
    <li> Have used and love this lemon shampoo for years.  The price was excellent and it arrived in short time.  I am wondering why the lemon body lotion is not available in the 32 oz. size.  Thank you for your good service.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful.  Smells like fresh squeezed lemons.  Great for oily hair.</li>
    <li> I recently replaced all of my personal care items with organic versions, and tried this shampoo for my long hair. I do not recommend. It is very drying, and the essential oils in the shampoo left my scalp terribly itchy. Within a couple of days of ceasing use of the product, my scalp returned to normal. Acure Organics are much more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I am very fussy about shampoo so I was pleased when this product really did how it was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Even after the first wash, there is the squeaky clean sound, but after the 2nd washing it was very clean and smelled so fresh.  It is a bit more expensive than some shampoo but &#x27;cleanly&#x27; works better than anything I have used before.</li>

    <li> Not good for people who have oily hair. Well not in my case because everybody&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
    <li> My old shampoo was reformulated and no longer cleaning my hair and scalp. I had used Avalon Organics Lemon Shampoo in the past and I loved the way it left my hair feeling clean. Decided to give it a try again, works great!!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that cleared up all the build up (from other shampoos) in my hair, after having a baby my body and hair was out of whack. This helped immensely. The smell is fresh and clean, and it&#x27;s a great price for two bottles. I would have given 5 stars but it is a bit drying, the first time I used too much and it made my scalp so dry I was constantly itching. I have a lot of hair but found I only need about 2 quarter coins worth to get it to work. It still does dry out a bit, but better than than an oily scalp full of product!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered as described without any damage or anything. It&#x27;s organic and this is the 2nd bottle that I bought. Refreshing lemon smell is not too much and very nice.</li>
    <li> Something changed about this shampoo, it used to be a better, thicker white substance, now it&#x27;s thin &amp; opaque.  I prefer the previous recipe, and don&#x27;t plan on continuing to use the new one.</li>
    <li> After the birth of my second child, my fine hair was oilier than when I was a teenager.  Preferring a more natural remedy, I tried a soapnut shampoo and an apple cider vinegar rinse for weeks.  It still looked awful.  My husband asked for a suggestion at our local Whole Foods and ended up buying me this shampoo.  It brought my hair back to \\&quot;normal.\\&quot;  It may not be as natural of a solution as I would have liked, but it worked!</li>
    <li> Love the product, had it on subscription. But the bottles kept coming open in transit. After losing three whole bottles--and cleaning up the resulting mess--I gave up and canceled. :/</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I use it as a body wash also. The lemon scent is fresh, just like the old &#x27;Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon&#x27; cologne from the 70s.</li>
