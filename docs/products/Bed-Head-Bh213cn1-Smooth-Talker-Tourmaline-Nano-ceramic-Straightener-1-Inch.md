      <li>LOVE it, so affordable and works just as well.  </li>
      <li>I love this straightener.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love this straightener.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get really hot , doesn&#x27;t bump good either.</li>
      <li>My own iron heats to 450 and does my hair in 1/4 the time and looks amazing, shiny, and stays stick straight without having to load up on product.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, but helps it style easily and keep the style all day.</li>
      <li>and I find it easy to use.</li>
      <li>if you have fine hair, then maybe this will work for you, but if you are like me and have wavy hair that isnt that easy to manage, try something else.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will last another 5-10 years since it is now just me using it as opposed to all the women in my family, so I know I&#x27;ll take good care of it.</li>
      <li>I used my first one until it died and loved it so much that I bought another one.</li>
      <li>I thought for sure that bedhead would be a great straightener for my unpredictable curly/wavy hair</li>
      <li>I could NOT believe I had found this exact one in my favorite color.</li>
      <li>after reading a bunch of reviews i was set and excited to finally own a new iron.</li>
      <li>I purchased this to tide me over until I could replace my GHD that my dear, sweet child broke.</li>
      <li>It gets hot very quickly.</li>
      <li>Team this up with their Large Round Brush and you wont need anything else to achieve the perfect hair style.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather wear my hair in a quick bun than go out with my hair looking like this.</li>
      <li>I own the pink version of this straigtener, I LOVE that it lights up to tell you the temperature.</li>
      <li>Heats fast and the settings are accurate.  </li>
      <li>It always made my hair smooth and straight</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite and works very well.</li>
      <li>On top of that, my hair goes right back to being curly</li>
      <li>it takes a while to be as hot as i need it to be</li>
      <li>This one, even after spending more than an hour working on my hair and 3 different products is frizzy and has become wavy</li>
      <li>As long as I let my thick wavy/curly frizzy hair towel dry for a couple hrs then used it, I was set for the day with beautiful smooth straight hair that shined!!!!</li>
      <li>So when mine was getting old, about 5 years or more old, i decided it was time for a new one.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love it, considering how much I love my other BH tool, but I advise against buying this particular flat iron.</li>
      <li>This straight iron not only straighten&#x27;s my hair but leaves it silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>Really like this straightener.  </li>
      <li>This is my second Bed Head Smooth Talker.</li>
      <li>Because I liked the flat iron I would just go out and buy the same model when that happened.</li>
      <li>This straighter does not get hot enough or stay hot for that matter.</li>
      <li>as it got older the irons did turn brown, but i also used to color my hair alot too.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull and snap my long, fine hair, like other cheap straighteners do.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting the plates to be smooth like the wand, but they are rough.</li>
      <li>I started out with this same straightener YEARS ago, when it first came out...</li>
      <li>This is the second one I have purchased after wearing the first one out after 5 years of use.  </li>
      <li>It felt a tiny bit bulky at first, but I think that was mostly because I was comparing it to my previous flat iron.</li>
      <li>The plates were old, and it had been dropped many times, and the button to turn it on and off was hard to turn off clogged by hair product</li>
      <li>/wavy when I am done (which, it didn&#x27;t do with my old straightener).  </li>
      <li>My 19 year old grandaughter asked for one just like it for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>and it takes multiple runs before the strand is completely straight.</li>
      <li>Regular straight iron&#x27;s can&#x27;t straighten my hair.  </li>
      <li>purchased the Smooth Talker a few months ago</li>
      <li>It seems to help infuse the coconut oil in and my hair is soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I own a Bed Head curling wand and absolutely love it, but this flat iron is atrocious.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally pretty straight with just a few waves.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it, I can hardly find a straightener that will actually work like it is supposed to</li>
      <li>My old straightener (that I had for about 4 years) finally broke so I decided to upgrade.  </li>
      <li>My first one lasted over 6 years, hopefully the second one will last as long.</li>
      <li>After my third flat iron quit on me I decided it was time to try a new brand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I figured being a Bed Head product, it would be a great straightener, but I was disappointed.  </li>
      <li>I am out of town visiting friends and family and intentionally left my flat iron at home (a Wet 2 Straight by Revlon</li>

<li> I got this flat iron years ago.  </li>
<li> it lasted me a very long time longest lasting straightener ive ever owned.</li>
<li> I always used mine on 400degrees and it still lasted this long.</li>
<li> So, I caved and thought I would try this one again, since I never really had any complaints about it anyway.  </li>
<li> I have curly/wavy hair that is partial to frizzing.  </li>
<li> I always used it almost everyday on my short layered hair.</li>
<li> i have naturally wavy and thick hair</li>
<li> so if you have long thick hair you might want to stick with a 2in and if you have short hair stick with this one.</li>
<li> The lights were always green and it didnt take long at all to heat up maybe about 2mins.</li>
<li> i plan on getting the pink 2in straightener from bed head soon!</li>
<li> It works okay, but I am slightly disappointed.</li>
<li> It is impossible to run it smoothly through each section of hair.</li>
<li> (before, it took half that).  </li>
<li> If it is a humid day, I add a little hair gel to keep the style longer, but if it is not raining, it lasts for 2 days till I wash my hair again.  </li>
<li> After one use of this, the ends of my hair were dried and frayed.</li>
<li> That one fell on the floor and broke in half, too!  </li>
<li> The Paul Mitchell broke in half at the hinge, so I ended up buying ANOTHER Paul Mitchell (not sure why!).  </li>
<li> This straightener really sucks...</li>
<li> I have thick curly stubborn hair.  </li>
<li> The dial to turn the heat up and down is in a bad place because when I used the straightener, my hand would touch and move the temperature up and down.  </li>
<li> somehow, I got sucked into the hype of the expensive Paul Mitchell straighteners, and bought one of those to replace it.  </li>
<li> but I was wrong.  </li>
<li> so I was disappointed when my clients hair would not bump and they broke after while so it&#x27;s whatever.</li>
<li> I am extremely disappointed this this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love love love love my straightner I works really well and makes my hair look good very pleased with this</li>
    <li> great price and product just as described. it works great and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair too frizzy. I bought it for my stepdaughter who has curly hair. She is only 12 and needs to practice but it does work great!</li>
    <li> Preface: My hair is naturally pretty straight with just a few waves. I&#x27;ve been using straighteners for 5+ years as part of my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the same cheap-ish flat iron for years. I would go through this cycle of using it happily for 1-2 years and then one day it would just stop heating. Because I liked the flat iron I would just go out and buy the same model when that happened. After my third flat iron quit on me I decided it was time to try a new brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Smooth Talker a few months ago and I have been very pleased with it. It gets hot very quickly. It felt a tiny bit bulky at first, but I think that was mostly because I was comparing it to my previous flat iron. I am very happy with the results of this straightener and I find it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly stubborn hair.  I got this flat iron years ago.  it has been my best friend.  I use leave in spray conditioner, just a spritz, then add coconut oil, and strengthen.  It seems to help infuse the coconut oil in and my hair is soft and silky. If it is a humid day, I add a little hair gel to keep the style longer, but if it is not raining, it lasts for 2 days till I wash my hair again.  it has not damaged my hair, I have used it for about 3 years, about once a week. I also should mention I use Bedhead reconstructive shampoo and conditioner which may help.  I had always been terrified of flat irons.  This one is awesome!</li>
    <li> My old straightener (that I had for about 4 years) finally broke so I decided to upgrade.  I thought for sure that bedhead would be a great straightener for my unpredictable curly/wavy hair but I was wrong.  It works okay but it takes me about an hour now to straighten my hair (before, it took half that).  On top of that, my hair goes right back to being curly/wavy when I am done (which, it didn&#x27;t do with my old straightener).  I tried using hairspray, hair protector, and whatnot to no avail.  It works okay, but I am slightly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am out of town visiting friends and family and intentionally left my flat iron at home (a Wet 2 Straight by Revlon I think, $20 at Walmart) because my friend had this one here for me to use. I HATE this! My own iron heats to 450 and does my hair in 1/4 the time and looks amazing, shiny, and stays stick straight without having to load up on product. This one, even after spending more than an hour working on my hair and 3 different products is frizzy and has become wavy/curly again within 2 hours of finishing. I would never in a million years recommend this product. I&#x27;d rather wear my hair in a quick bun than go out with my hair looking like this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to tide me over until I could replace my GHD that my dear, sweet child broke. I own a Bed Head curling wand and absolutely love it, but this flat iron is atrocious. I was expecting the plates to be smooth like the wand, but they are rough. It is impossible to run it smoothly through each section of hair. It catches and I could actually hear hair snapping. After one use of this, the ends of my hair were dried and frayed. I wanted to love it, considering how much I love my other BH tool, but I advise against buying this particular flat iron.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, I can hardly find a straightener that will actually work like it is supposed to but this one does a wonderful job. Thinking about getting a couple more as Christmas gifts!!!</li>
    <li> Had no problems with the seller or item arriving on time.  I do not like the straightener.  I figured being a Bed Head product, it would be a great straightener, but I was disappointed.  The dial to turn the heat up and down is in a bad place because when I used the straightener, my hand would touch and move the temperature up and down.  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener.  This is the second one I have purchased after wearing the first one out after 5 years of use.  My 19 year old grandaughter asked for one just like it for Christmas.  Heats fast and the settings are accurate.  Doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, but helps it style easily and keep the style all day.</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy hair that is partial to frizzing.  Regular straight iron&#x27;s can&#x27;t straighten my hair.  This straight iron not only straighten&#x27;s my hair but leaves it silky smooth.  I used my first one until it died and loved it so much that I bought another one.</li>
    <li> This is my second Bed Head Smooth Talker. My first one lasted over 6 years, hopefully the second one will last as long. Went through 3 or 4 others that never matched the way this works.</li>
    <li> When i came across this straightener i assumed it would be great considering the brand. after reading a bunch of reviews i was set and excited to finally own a new iron. i have naturally wavy and thick hair and i figured a 1 inch iron would be perfect. however, this iron doesnt measure up to what i had hoped. it takes a while to be as hot as i need it to be and it takes multiple runs before the strand is completely straight. even after im done, it doesnt take too long before my hair resorts back to its wavy-ness. if you have fine hair, then maybe this will work for you, but if you are like me and have wavy hair that isnt that easy to manage, try something else.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It makes my frizzy and unruly hair sleek and manageable. Team this up with their Large Round Brush and you wont need anything else to achieve the perfect hair style.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener at target when i was in the 11th grade back in 2007-2008 I just had to throw it out this yr 2013! it lasted me a very long time longest lasting straightener ive ever owned. I always used it almost everyday on my short layered hair. It always made my hair smooth and straight and I never had to use any products in my hair. As long as I let my thick wavy/curly frizzy hair towel dry for a couple hrs then used it, I was set for the day with beautiful smooth straight hair that shined!!!! I would recommend this one to anyone! now that im growing my hair out i plan on getting the pink 2in straightener from bed head soon! Remember that This blue straightener is a 1in so if you have long thick hair you might want to stick with a 2in and if you have short hair stick with this one. I always used mine on 400degrees and it still lasted this long. as it got older the irons did turn brown, but i also used to color my hair alot too. The lights were always green and it didnt take long at all to heat up maybe about 2mins.</li>
    <li> I own the pink version of this straigtener, I LOVE that it lights up to tell you the temperature. So when mine was getting old, about 5 years or more old, i decided it was time for a new one. The plates were old, and it had been dropped many times, and the button to turn it on and off was hard to turn off clogged by hair product im sure. I could NOT believe I had found this exact one in my favorite color. I love this straightener. It&#x27;s by far my favorite and works very well. I have rather unruley hair. It does the job perfectly! I&#x27;m sure it will last another 5-10 years since it is now just me using it as opposed to all the women in my family, so I know I&#x27;ll take good care of it.</li>
    <li> Really like this straightener.  I started out with this same straightener YEARS ago, when it first came out...somehow, I got sucked into the hype of the expensive Paul Mitchell straighteners, and bought one of those to replace it.  The Paul Mitchell broke in half at the hinge, so I ended up buying ANOTHER Paul Mitchell (not sure why!).  That one fell on the floor and broke in half, too!  So, I caved and thought I would try this one again, since I never really had any complaints about it anyway.  LOVE it, so affordable and works just as well.  Doesn&#x27;t pull and snap my long, fine hair, like other cheap straighteners do.  Pulls really smoothly, leaves it looking just as good as a Paul Mitchell!</li>
    <li> This straighter does not get hot enough or stay hot for that matter. I am extremely disappointed this this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t straighten ur hair very good! This straightener really sucks...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get really hot , doesn&#x27;t bump good either. And I do hair so I was disappointed when my clients hair would not bump and they broke after while so it&#x27;s whatever.</li>
