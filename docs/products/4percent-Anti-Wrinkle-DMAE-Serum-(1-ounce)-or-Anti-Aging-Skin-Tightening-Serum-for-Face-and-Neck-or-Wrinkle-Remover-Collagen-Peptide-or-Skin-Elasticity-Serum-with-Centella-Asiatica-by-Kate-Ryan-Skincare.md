      <li>It has worked wonderfully, I have been recommending this to my clients.</li>
      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>I ordered this wonderful serum and lo and behold</li>
      <li>It is amazing!!!</li>
      <li>Whether it is or isn&#x27;t, I am very happy with what I am seeing in the mirror!</li>
      <li>I would be proud to carry Kate Ryan in my MED SPA.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to report I see a difference.</li>
      <li>It is a great blend, a great price</li>
      <li>I sport,  is noticibly firmer, and the wrinkles on my neck and clavicle are remarkably deminished.  </li>
      <li>Loving this product!</li>
      <li>but I believe it is a good product.</li>
      <li>When I look in the mirror now I feel There is still more life in me!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>the combo is amazing for my skin.</li>
      <li>I have replaced my Dr. Perricone serum with this one, and I&#x27;m loving the results.  </li>
      <li>It really is the best DMAE product you can find.</li>
      <li>and so went immediately to amazon.com to review and order my own to see if it works.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very easy on my skin so it doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation.</li>
      <li>So far the best DMAE serum I have tried.</li>
      <li>but what I love the most is that it is not greasy and my skin feels amazing as soon as it is applied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is full of really good stuff for your skin and it absorbs rapidly without being greasy or sticky.  </li>
      <li>Love kate Ryan products.</li>
      <li>Besides the solvents used in some fragrant products can be contradicting the helpful effects of products and harmful to skin, so I&#x27;m glad the makers of this product don&#x27;t seem to be concerned with &amp;#34;perfuming&amp;#34; their products.</li>
      <li>I really love this serum.</li>
      <li>I might as well give myself one more chance at a beauty product.  </li>
      <li>I will continue using this product and will review it again after more time has passed.</li>
      <li>I started to fix myself up more and it gave me so much more confidence.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>My skin has a glow that I&#x27;ve received many compliments on.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It took about 3-4 weeks for me to be able to say that I can see a  distinct difference  </li>
      <li>I like this product, it makes my skin smooth</li>
      <li>I am the snooty Spa owner who rarely gives my recommendation on a product unless I fall in love with it.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a significant change in my wrinkles but also my skin tone.</li>
      <li>It is powerful, yet very light; it feels like water, it soaks right in.</li>
      <li>I start with clean skin, apply Kate Ryan Vitamin C Day Time Serum, then DMAE followed by moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over a month and out of the KR Skincare line this product is my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>Its not oily, absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
      <li>My jawline is more pronounced and my skin feels smoother and more firm.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says, it firms the skin.</li>
      <li>DMAE Serums were recommended in my most recent GQ magazine.</li>
      <li>I love this product and this whole skincare line in general.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Kate  Ryan!</li>
      <li>I feel overall brighter and more even</li>
      <li>I was interested</li>
      <li>So perhaps it is the combo of these two products that has yielded these positive results.  </li>
      <li>I use it along with the Kate Ryan Vitamin C Serum in the morning and you can really see results upon first application.</li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>Really like this serum.</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t care about fragrance.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really tell a difference after using this product.</li>
      <li>and I have very problem skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough as not to cause any clogging of my pores.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s been doing pretty well with the acne products I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
      <li>This particular product I use twice a day</li>
      <li>BUY THIS for tightening the delicate under eye area and be sure to look at the whole line!.</li>
      <li>I was reluctant at first, to use this product with the acne product line I&#x27;m currently using, because there is so much going on in this product.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how well the product works.  </li>
      <li>I am 40 years old and have brown lines, and of course crows feet.</li>
      <li>; I am delighted to be proved wrong.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a cosmetic product to try to improve my appearance due to aging.</li>
      <li>In a panic I ordered this product because it was the only one I found with such a high percentage of the DMAE.</li>
      <li>It has DMAE, CoQ10 and Hyalurnic Acid, and frankly, I was worried there would be a bad reaction, but there hasn&#x27;t been, I&#x27;m happy to say.</li>
      <li>the modest double chin</li>
      <li>I own a MedSpa, I am 58 with creases under my eyes, after having Fraxel laser treatment to reduce them away they were still there and looked worse!</li>

<li> I own a MedSpa, I am 58 with creases under my eyes, after having Fraxel laser treatment to reduce them away they were still there and looked worse!</li>
<li> They are highly concentrated so you only need a little</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it is helpful or not.</li>
<li> and they last a long time.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say anything negative or positive about this product yet.  </li>
<li> But so far, I can definitely recommend it to others for improvements to small areas of baggy skin..</li>
<li> The overall appearance of my skin seems to have improved since using this product and my breaks outs seem to happen with less frequency and intensity.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and a half, not as long as I like to use a product before writing a review for it.</li>
<li> I will continue to buy it and try other products in the line as the budget permits.  </li>
<li> Not sure of how long-lasting the effects will be as I have only used it for about 4 - 5 weeks.</li>
<li> The DMAE serum soaks in and produces a slight firming feel.  </li>
<li> Brighter, less noticeable wrinkles.  </li>
<li> A little of this product goes a long way as it is a true serum; not a lotion base.  </li>
<li> I have been using it for just under two weeks with hopes that it could improve the looks of my neck and jaw line, and despite a little voice inside telling me &amp;#34;This is probably not going to work, &amp;#34</li>
<li> It helps keep my skin firm and reduces the signs of aging.</li>
<li> also use both cleansers and a few of the hydration products at night.</li>
<li> There is a lot of damage to my skin from acne and the past use of acne products that have made my acne worse, so it&#x27;s a little hard to tell if this product has reversed that damage with the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
<li> I have applied small amounts both in the morning and at night and rubbed into the skin.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve now used it for the past two days and have already seen results.</li>
<li> I usually like to wait at least 2 months before reviewing it to give the product time to manifest any reactions with my skin.</li>
<li> The reason why is because I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s</li>
<li> Not a pleasant fragrance either</li>
<li> The scent of this product isn&#x27;t bad</li>
<li> I was so sick with depression and Anxiety.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> DMAE Serums were recommended in my most recent GQ magazine. I was interested and so went immediately to amazon.com to review and order my own to see if it works. I found Kate Ryan&#x27;s 4% DMAE Serums and decided to give it a try based on the reviews. I&#x27;ve now used it for the past two days and have already seen results. My jawline is more pronounced and my skin feels smoother and more firm. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I use the C serum with DMAE and the combo is amazing for my skin. Love kate Ryan products. I also use collagen booster. Her skin line is tops.</li>
    <li> I love this product and this whole skincare line in general.  It helps keep my skin firm and reduces the signs of aging.</li>
    <li> I am stunned at how well this product works!  I have been using it for just under two weeks with hopes that it could improve the looks of my neck and jaw line, and despite a little voice inside telling me &amp;#34;This is probably not going to work, &amp;#34; I am delighted to be proved wrong.  The skin and (sigh) the modest double chin I sport,  is noticibly firmer, and the wrinkles on my neck and clavicle are remarkably deminished.  The overall tone and taughtness of my face is just terrific!  I must admit that several months ago I began using C Serum 22, a vitamin serum, twice a day, and now I am using it in conjunction with 4% Dmae....So perhaps it is the combo of these two products that has yielded these positive results.  Whether it is or isn&#x27;t, I am very happy with what I am seeing in the mirror!</li>
    <li> Loving this product! Can already see a difference especially around my eyes. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The DMAE serum soaks in and produces a slight firming feel.  I start with clean skin, apply Kate Ryan Vitamin C Day Time Serum, then DMAE followed by moisturizer.  A little of this product goes a long way as it is a true serum; not a lotion base.  I use the DMAE morning &amp; evening.  My skin has a glow that I&#x27;ve received many compliments on. Very happy to have found Kate Ryan skin care!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a cosmetic product to try to improve my appearance due to aging. I specifically wanted something to help with sagging wrinkled skin under my eyes. It took about 3-4 weeks for me to be able to say that I can see a  distinct difference  but I can now say without hesitation that in the areas below my eyes, the skin has tightened up and appears much younger and healthier. I have applied small amounts both in the morning and at night and rubbed into the skin.  Not sure of how long-lasting the effects will be as I have only used it for about 4 - 5 weeks. But so far, I can definitely recommend it to others for improvements to small areas of baggy skin..</li>
    <li> I really love this serum. I am now in my 60&#x27;s and thought I would have to have a face lift. Because I started to look like a bulldog. So I thought if I am going to go through the pain of surgery I might as well give myself one more chance at a beauty product.  I ordered this wonderful serum and lo and behold I looked so much younger. I started to fix myself up more and it gave me so much more confidence. I was so sick with depression and Anxiety. When I look in the mirror now I feel There is still more life in me! Thank you so much Kate Ryan you are a life saver!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference after using this product. Not a pleasant fragrance either</li>
    <li> I like this product, it makes my skin smooth and I can see a difference in the tightness of my skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything negative or positive about this product yet.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it is helpful or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and a half, not as long as I like to use a product before writing a review for it. I usually like to wait at least 2 months before reviewing it to give the product time to manifest any reactions with my skin. The reason why is because I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and I have very problem skin. I have been experimenting with different acne products to use with anti-aging products to test compatibility, so I decided to try this product. So far, it&#x27;s been doing pretty well with the acne products I&#x27;ve been using. I was reluctant at first, to use this product with the acne product line I&#x27;m currently using, because there is so much going on in this product. It has DMAE, CoQ10 and Hyalurnic Acid, and frankly, I was worried there would be a bad reaction, but there hasn&#x27;t been, I&#x27;m happy to say. It&#x27;s light enough as not to cause any clogging of my pores. It&#x27;s also very easy on my skin so it doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation. There is a lot of damage to my skin from acne and the past use of acne products that have made my acne worse, so it&#x27;s a little hard to tell if this product has reversed that damage with the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using this. The overall appearance of my skin seems to have improved since using this product and my breaks outs seem to happen with less frequency and intensity. The scent of this product isn&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;s also not fragrant either, but I really don&#x27;t care about fragrance. It&#x27;s the results I&#x27;m looking for which this product seems to be delivering. Besides the solvents used in some fragrant products can be contradicting the helpful effects of products and harmful to skin, so I&#x27;m glad the makers of this product don&#x27;t seem to be concerned with &amp;#34;perfuming&amp;#34; their products. I will continue using this product and will review it again after more time has passed.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is full of really good stuff for your skin and it absorbs rapidly without being greasy or sticky.  I have replaced my Dr. Perricone serum with this one, and I&#x27;m loving the results.  Thanks Kate  Ryan!</li>
    <li> I like this serum a lot.  Makes my skin firmer and it is non greasy.</li>
    <li> Have only been using for two weeks, but I swear I see a difference in my skin. My biggest issue is my neck and starting to see some sagging around my jowls and this has made a difference.  Will continue to keep this in my line up!</li>
    <li> It really is the best DMAE product you can find. I use it along with the Kate Ryan Vitamin C Serum in the morning and you can really see results upon first application. It does exactly what it says, it firms the skin. It is powerful, yet very light; it feels like water, it soaks right in. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month and out of the KR Skincare line this product is my absolute favorite. I am 40 years old and have brown lines, and of course crows feet. I have noticed a significant change in my wrinkles but also my skin tone. I feel overall brighter and more even but what I love the most is that it is not greasy and my skin feels amazing as soon as it is applied.&lt;br /&gt;I also use both cleansers and a few of the hydration products at night. This particular product I use twice a day and I can&#x27;t get over what a difference it makes! I will continue to buy it and try other products in the line as the budget permits.

It is a great blend, a great price and it really works. I am the snooty Spa owner who rarely gives my recommendation on a product unless I fall in love with it. BUY THIS for tightening the delicate under eye area and be sure to look at the whole line!. I would be proud to carry Kate Ryan in my MED SPA.</li>
    <li> Really like this serum.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected but I believe it is a good product.</li>
    <li> It works! I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 1 month and I&#x27;m happy to report I see a difference.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how well the product works.  No redness, stinging, or burning.  My skin continued to improve overall.  Brighter, less noticeable wrinkles.  I am 59.  Ran for 38 years outdoors.  My skin is holding up with the use of Perricone, this product and olive oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now. It is amazing!!! Its not oily, absorbs quickly into the skin. Will definitely buy it again. So far the best DMAE serum I have tried.</li>
