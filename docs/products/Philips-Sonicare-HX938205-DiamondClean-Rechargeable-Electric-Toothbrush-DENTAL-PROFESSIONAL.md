      <li>Reviewers&#x27; opinions, I have found are much more reliable than Experts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another beneficial aspect is that gum growth starts taking place between the capped teeth, much more than you get with manual cap teeth flossing material and the rubber &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I gave it as a gift because I love the one I have.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this tooth brush.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush and feel that calling it a toothbrush is belittling it because it so much better than any toothbrush Imhave used before.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the gums and easy to use.</li>
      <li>it even has a ramp up program for gum care when you first start using it!</li>
      <li>you go to the quality of a good electric toothbrush, it hard to be satisfied with a manual one.</li>
      <li>A LOT OF FUN,</li>
      <li>My only suggestion is to make the setting light better readable.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s 100% worth it.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel as clean as if the dentist had just polished them and the brush seems to do a better job than I can manually at getting a couple of crevices way back in the back.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The travel case and USB rechargability are huge pluses for anyone that travels frequently.</li>
      <li>Love the various cleaning options and the.</li>
      <li>and I began to see results by first 3-4 days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We each charged our brand new brushes a full 24 hours</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really</li>
      <li>VERY MUCH！IT HAD GIVEN Me</li>
      <li>High powered tooth brush gets the job done in all those crevices!</li>
      <li>If you really care about your dental health you will have one of these.  </li>
      <li>this is our second generation and it leaves my teeth feeling so clean.</li>
      <li>and we are going on our third week of a full charge, with 2-3 x / brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Much more usable compared to previous models we have used.</li>
      <li>My previous Sonic brush was purchased from a dentist, top of the line and held up for 12-13 years before it bit</li>
      <li>THIS CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY MY DENTAL HYGENIST.</li>
      <li>DO NOT buy the Dental Professional Model!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cosmetic value alone is worth the big bucks.</li>
      <li>For the money, this unit was well worth the extra $$$&#x27;s to whiten and polish capped teeth.</li>
      <li>It is strange in the beginnign, tickling big time, but once you get past that the cleaning is great.</li>
      <li>Also, it seems like the motor is loud, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a buzz but sounds loud in your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>review applies to the Dental Professional Model which I purchased here from URUSH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They said because I bought the Dental Professional</li>
      <li>It goes far beyond what I thought it could do</li>
      <li>The unit&#x27;s battery life is also very good (not sure how long it lasts, but at least a week-1.5 weeks), in fact, you may not even need the charger for shorter trips.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s barely working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first use was odd, because the I could feel the vibrations throughout my face and mouth, but the tickling sensation was barely noticeable in just a couple days.  </li>

<li> Replacement heads are expensive too</li>

    <li> I bought this model in June of 2012. It&#x27;s been turning on and off by itself lately. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s possessed. Now it&#x27;s barely working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even fully charged it&#x27;s just awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was excellent in the beginning. I will have to check the warranty but it&#x27;s really disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 7/23/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review applies to the Dental Professional Model which I purchased here from URUSH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Phillips because I was still under the two year warranty. They said because I bought the Dental Professional Model- the warranty won&#x27;t cover it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO BUYER BEWARE. DO NOT buy the Dental Professional Model!! The sellers buy them CHEAP and triple the price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the one sold by Amazon themselves if you are going to purchase one: Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE has been fantastic! Because my model was defective they reimbursed my entire purchase amount back to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still want to try the Diamond Clean again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure where to purchase it though - here or at Phillips. You just have to be REALLY careful who you purchase it from here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> amazing product at a really good price. Should have bought one years ago. Best price I could find on Internet!</li>
    <li> Worked for a few months - died in nine months - NO WARRANTY - no support - try a different brand - a different manufacturer</li>
    <li> Needed a new Sonicaire and this one is the top model.  Much more usable compared to previous models we have used.</li>
    <li> GOOD ，I LIKE It VERY MUCH！IT HAD GIVEN Me A LOT OF FUN,I&#x27;LL RECOMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS!NICE NICE GREAT</li>
    <li> I have noticeably whiter teeth after using this for a few months. It works very well at cleaning your teeth without being harsh on your gums- it even has a ramp up program for gum care when you first start using it! The travel case and USB rechargability are huge pluses for anyone that travels frequently. The unit&#x27;s battery life is also very good (not sure how long it lasts, but at least a week-1.5 weeks), in fact, you may not even need the charger for shorter trips. If you do need to recharge the unit, you don&#x27;t need a proprietary charger- any USB and laptop/desktop/etc. will work. Admittedly, it is a lot of money for a tooth brush and the heads aren&#x27;t exactly cheap, but if you are on the go and need to look your best, accept no substitutes!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is incredible! If you take the time to run the full cycle..maybe even twice, it&#x27;ll leave you teeth feeling like you just got them cleaned at the dentist. My teeth have gotten a couple shades whiter from switching to this toothbrush from a manual. It&#x27;s gentle on the gums and easy to use. It&#x27;s waterproof and can be used in the shower, the battery lasts a long time. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this tooth brush and wish that I bought it years before. It gets all the hard to reach spots and does all the work for you. Get this toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I wouldn&#x27;t get a charging glass in the package.</li>
    <li> This brush charge lasts about two weeks.  It cleans well and has a built in timer.  Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> If you really care about your dental health you will have one of these.  packaging is great and the new brush head is the best they have made.  This is my third sonicare toothbrush in over a decade.  Batteries don&#x27;t last forever.</li>
    <li> I chose this model because the induction charging glass looks really cool (silly, but that&#x27;s why) and haven&#x27;t regretted a cent of the price.  The first use was odd, because the I could feel the vibrations throughout my face and mouth, but the tickling sensation was barely noticeable in just a couple days.

Also, it seems like the motor is loud, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s just a buzz but sounds loud in your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is the best! I just switched from the regular Sonicare and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband.  He travels alot and he is enjoying the travel case and charger.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrushes. this is our second generation and it leaves my teeth feeling so clean. The carrying case is terrific because I travel almost weekly for work. We each charged our brand new brushes a full 24 hours and we are going on our third week of a full charge, with 2-3 x / brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the price.</li>
    <li> MY TEETH ARE 10 TIMES CLEANER THAN WITH A MANUEL TOOTH BRUSH. THIS CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY MY DENTAL HYGENIST. I WASN&#x27;T BRUSHING MY TEETH VERY GOOD WITH A MANUAL AND MY HYGENIST SEES THE DIFFERENCE WITH THIS TOOTH BRUSH. YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE TOO..A MUST BUY AND A GREAT GIFT!!!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is like nothing you have ever used before. It is strange in the beginnign, tickling big time, but once you get past that the cleaning is great. I love this toothbrush and feel that calling it a toothbrush is belittling it because it so much better than any toothbrush Imhave used before. Beware however that if you have recently had oral surgery you need to contact your dentist/periodontist before using this.</li>
    <li> My teeth has never felt so clean before after every brush. High powered tooth brush gets the job done in all those crevices!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this tooth brush. It&#x27;s amazing. Great clean feeling afterwards. A little pricey but it&#x27;s 100% worth it. Replacement heads are expensive too but they last at least a month and a half.</li>
    <li> Replaced mt e-series with this Diamond Clean model, and I am very pleased with it.  My only suggestion is to make the setting light better readable.  It is difficult, sometimes, to see the setting one is using.  I guess with time the setting can become intuitive enough to not worry about the setting indicator.  But, I doubt that &amp;#34;intuition&amp;#34; was a part of the engineering.</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift because I love the one I have.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but compared to the half dozen cheaper brushes I&#x27;ve bought over the years, this is a hands down winner. It&#x27;s got a more powerful motor, longer battery life, does a remarkable job of cleaning my teeth, and is very easy to keep clean. The accessories and charging options are also very nice. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I found that this tooth brush so far, ownership x 2-3 weeks is everything that I read and expected it to be (according to what the manufacturer claims). My previous Sonic brush was purchased from a dentist, top of the line and held up for 12-13 years before it bit the dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you go to the quality of a good electric toothbrush, it hard to be satisfied with a manual one. I did much internet research, too much as usual before deciding on this toothbrush. Reviewers&#x27; opinions, I have found are much more reliable than Experts. My gut instinct had to take over in selecting this toothbrush over its competitors as manufacturing companies appear to be influencing ratings, including Consumer Reports. All rating experts including CR appears to be leaving off good brand name lines that deserved to be in their testing. This factored into my decision to go more with reviewers&#x27; have to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I selected the most expensive model was the claims to whitens teeth, including caps. I had always been told by dentists and oral hygienists that you can&#x27;t whiten and polish caps or capped tooth. They always said that coffee and tea permanently stains the porcelain materials. For the money, this unit was well worth the extra $$$&#x27;s to whiten and polish capped teeth. It goes far beyond what I thought it could do and I began to see results by first 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another beneficial aspect is that gum growth starts taking place between the capped teeth, much more than you get with manual cap teeth flossing material and the rubber &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34;. Capped teeth have their issue with gum receding away from caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetic value alone is worth the big bucks.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the various cleaning options and the. Oil charging dish!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush because my friend&#x27;s parents are both dentists/prosthodontists and this is the toothbrush that they bought her,</li>
    <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I have ever used. Within 2 weeks I can se and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Having upgraded from a previous Sonic care that lasted almost 9 years I see it as a welcome upgrade, the case works awesome so does the inductive charging. I have been using the gum setting and my gums feel stronger and cleaner after a week of usage.</li>
