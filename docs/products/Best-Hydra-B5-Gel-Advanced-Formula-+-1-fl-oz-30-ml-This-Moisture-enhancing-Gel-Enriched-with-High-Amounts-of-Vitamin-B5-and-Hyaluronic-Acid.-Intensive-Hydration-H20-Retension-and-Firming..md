<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product. It was recommend to me when I was getting a facial for dryness. It really helps to hydrate the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.  really hydrates the skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love their products.  As good as the more expensive skinceuticals at a much better price. I have reordered 2 more items in the professional size because they are so good.</li>
    <li> Not that great....like paste.  I have used other brands of B5 gel but this one didn&#x27;t absorb &amp; felt like paste.</li>
    <li> I bought this not really expecting anything, and I have to say I am impressed :) It moisturizes my skin I don&#x27;t&#x27; break out and my scars are starting to lighten up :) I also think my skin tone is evening out.....Finally something that works~!~!~</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of comments on my face looking  younger (I&#x27;m 60).  I spent most of my youth in the sun, not wearing sunscreen.  Really beat up my face.  I&#x27;m now trying to make up for the misspent youth.  I put the topical Vitamin C on my face, and I&#x27;ve read that putting this on afterwards helps push the vitamin C into my skin.  When I run out, I&#x27;ll buy some more.  I put it on my face after my  morning workout.</li>
    <li> If you want more from your moisturizer, buy this product; it helps your skin take in moisture and retain it. I love it, great for the dry-Colorado climate.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a month, and it has improved the texture of my skin.  My skin is normal to dry, and when I use this product, I usually do not need a moisturizer.  I would highly recommend this product.  Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based highly in part of the positive reviews left by others not only on this HA Serum, but other brands as well. I did not expect this to replace my moisturizer, &amp; believe me: it can&#x27;t. What I was hoping for based on the reviews was: (a) A \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; effect in some of the more age-affected areas of my face e.g., sunken cheeks, slightly sagging nasolabial folds, &amp; a crepy, sunken tear trough; (b) More effective results from my moisturizers. I think I may have found my genie in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely skeptical, but for under 30 bucks I was willing to give it a shot. After 1 day I was already extremely impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(a) \\&quot;Plumping\\&quot; effect: TOTALLY worked! I have lost volume in my cheeks, which has brought out that funky cottage cheese effect from old, mild acne scars. I have mild sagging in the \\&quot;marionette\\&quot; area by the nose, &amp; the tear trough area is crepy. I have put other products on my under-eye area that have caused me to wake up with puffy, swollen eyes, so I did not put it there before bed. The rest of my face got the full treatment, then covered with Clarins Super Restorative Night Cream (nice stuff). I woke up today with a full, healthy face, but not puffy or swollen. I placed it everywhere again, this time adding under the eyes and on my upper lids, then covered it with an Estee Lauder Re-Nutriv \\&quot;Ultimate\\&quot; creme. The fullness remained in my cheeks, and my eyelids (top &amp; bottom) came back to life! This is much better than I expected. Don&#x27;t get me wrong--I do NOT look like I have had HA injections, but the difference is significant enough for ME to notice, and that&#x27;s what matters here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(b) I have NEVER had this sort of result from the high-end moisturizers I mentioned above, and I have been using Re-Nutriv since February. The plumper, younger, healthier skin is absolutely from using the serum, not from the moisture creams alone. Job well done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to give you an idea of how serious I am about the condition of my aging skin, I have an appointment this Wednesday for Botox on the forehead (1st time ever; freaking out, so wish me luck!), and I was planning to discuss @ this appointment Juvaderm, Restylane,or any other HA injectable to return the lost volume to my cheeks, tear trough, and maybe the nasolabial folds. I am already sketchy about getting the Botox (hoping to only do it once or twice while treating the lines w/Retin-A &amp; Glycolic Acid), but years of raising my eyebrows like everything is shocking to me (WHAT?!?!!) has left deep horizontal expression lines. I am 39, and the other age-related skin issues have really become a major stress factor for me this year. I do not want to get HA injections, but I didn&#x27;t believe anything topical could give me the results I want. I even toyed with the idea of small cheek implants, but I hate the thought of synthetic things permanently stuffed in my face, fear an ugly result or side effects, and don&#x27;t have the $7,000 for that surgery anyway. I decided to spend the $30 on this as a last-ditch effort to save myself from expensive, potentially unnatural-looking injections, and all I can say is, \\&quot;WOW! Thank you so much!\\&quot; I am absolutely shocked &amp; beyond pleased with this serum. I have wasted literally thousands of dollars on pricy designer creams &amp; serums, and having a relatively inexpensive bottle of simple ingredients do so much absolutely amazes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in a few months if I stop seeing these happy results, or if I start seeing the natural collagen repair I mentioned in product hope (c). I&#x27;ll have to get a bottle of this for my 72-year-old mother to see if it works acceptable wonders on more advanced skin problems since she is also considering injectables after already having undergone a facelift, a necklift, and an upper-eye lift (blepheroplasty). I think She&#x27;d be excited if it did half the job it did on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve been using it every day and night for the last 3 days, and I&#x27;m stillthrilled. I definitely use more than the 5-6 drops recommended, although a little goes a long way. I am sure I&#x27;m going to go through the bottle too fast (faster than most people would), but it&#x27;s still worth it to me so long as it keeps me hydrated and plump. LOVE IT! I am even able to use less moisturizer than ever before.rops recommended, although a little goes a long way.

    <li> Excellent for your skin and compares to the over priced brand. A must in your daily beauty care. Price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have never written a product review for anything, but I feel that I must write a review for this excellent product!  I went to my facialist and she suggested that I should start using B5 gel.  She was trying to sell me the one from Skinceuticals at $50 for a small 1oz. bottle!!!  I didn&#x27;t make that purchase, but instead, I went home and searched for this product on Amazon.com.  When I typed in B5 Gel, CosmeticSkinSolutions came up.  I read the reviews and they were all very good, and so I decided to give this line a try.  Within 2-3 days after my ordering, the items arrived!  I was so excited to try my new B5 Gel and after only a few days of using the product, my skin improved so much and I was very happy.  After a week, I contacted the representative Jonathan and told him I wanted to order the Phyto serum and the Vitamin C + E serum.  These products are AMAZING!!!!!  I know I&#x27;m going to stick with this line for a long time!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product from one of the competitors for years and decided to try this since the prices were so much lower. I don&#x27;t see any difference between the two. This works just as well and I will continue to buy from Cosmetic Skin Solutions. The Hydra B5 Gel Advanced Formula hydrates my dry skin and seems to firm up my eye area. Great product!</li>
    <li> I find the product is sticky -- have the need to wash my hands following application on my face.  I used it at night, and in the morning used the Cosmetic Skin Solutions Vitamin C 20% and I found that sticky also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bigger problem with the Vitamin C 20% is that it caused my moisturizer/sunscreen (La Roche Posy Athelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid) to &amp;#34;pill up&amp;#34; when applied over the Vitamin C 20%, and even more so when applying foundation on top of the sunscreen.  This occured even if I allowed extra time for each product to dry. I found the same thing occured if I used the Hydra B5 Gel in the morning.  So now I am back to the Skin Ceutical B5 in the morning and will finish the Cosmetic Skin Solutions products at night to use them up.  Very disappointing after the positive reviews that I read, particularly for the cost savings.  I will not buy again, nor would I recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product, and good price.</li>
    <li> this is a great GREAT serum for the face and neck!</li>
    <li> I really love this B5 gel. It&#x27;s great for winter months to add some extra moisture before putting on lotion. It soaks right in, it&#x27;s not greasy or oily AT ALL, and makes my skin feel so moisturized and soft. I even use it in the summer to add a little extra &amp;#34;dewiness&amp;#34; to my skin. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite skincare products. Would definitely recommend for anyone who is searching for something to use that&#x27;s more light, but works just as well as some of the heavier products. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use Skinceuticals B5 gel and LOVE it except for the price ( this same size bottle is 70-80 dollars by Skinceuticals) so far I do not see a difference. Ingredient list is the same.</li>
    <li> This Hydra B5 Gel Advanced formula works well for me. I have now used it for over one year. Good.</li>
    <li> I used to use skinceuticals B5 serum, but then found this product. And, honestly, never went back - it&#x27;s cheaper and does the same job. I personally didn&#x27;t find any difference between two products. I love it and use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product now for several years. My skin has never felt smoother, more hydrated, or looked better!</li>
    <li> I saw difference on my first used no problems....would absolutely recommended..... Thank you finally a product that works!!!! Use day and note :-) :-)</li>
    <li> I think this product is great my skin looks very hydrated now I will order again it works in combination with the vitamin c 20%</li>
    <li> Actually I bought the double pack of vitamin c+e with the B5 gel.I never took skin care very seriously until the neglect of years started to show. Wish I started sooner and that they had great products like these.I&#x27;ve used SkinMedica and alot of other costly brands which did&#x27;nt do anything(except in some cases cause negative effects)I saw and felt results of CSS almost immediately.My skin is much softer and almost has a glow.I use in the morning and before bed,they absorb very quickly so you don&#x27;t have that greasy feel.Makeup goes on more smoothly too!This will be my new regimen.I love these products!!!</li>
    <li> Makes skin soft and texture is wonderful.  Great price also.  Other companies charge $75-114 for similar product. Why pay more for same product?  Make sure not to use too often.</li>
    <li> Best Hydra that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Just love their products. This one very good to keep moisturised my face...Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive version of this product, and in all honesty, I cannot tell the difference between the two in its effectiveness. I use it religiously over a layer Phoretin CF serum daily, but allow it to dry completely first. It provides perfect moisture for my combination skin. While it&#x27;s still moist I quickly apply my sunscreen and the two absorb in a matter of seconds. This is all the moisture I need under my mineral powder foundation. I do apply a thin layer of primer over the sunscreen before the powder as well for a smooth application. I am 58 and get compliments on my dewy skin all the time. I highly recommend you try this product. Why spend so much money when you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
    <li> My skin type (FYI):  I have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin with deep acne scars and lots of blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to try this gel due to all the great reviews on Amazon.  I bought this gel to help relieve the dryness caused by the retinol cream (Tazorac).  This hyaluronic acid gel is hydrating, but not enough to reverse the drying effect of Tazorac that I&#x27;m using.  My skin still peels, itches and turns red from the drying side effect of Tazorac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off 2 stars due to the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture for my sensitive and itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) It forms clumps with the sunscreen and foundation, making my face look very messy and gross.&lt;br /&gt;3) I look on the &amp;#34;cosmetic skin solution&#x27;s&amp;#34; website, it does not specify the strength of hyaluronic acid.  The concentration of hyaluronic acid gel formulation can range from 0.1 % to 1 %. It would be helpful to know the strength so I can choose a concentration that is suitable for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this hyaluronic gel is only an average moisturizer for me despite all the great reviews.  I won&#x27;t repurchase this gel again.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for a miracle product, but then again I don&#x27;t have a facial regime, probably will work best for those with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it glides over your freshly-washed skin so amazingly and locks in moisture (I use a few moisturizing serums first and then this at the end before makeup). My skin look dewy and healthy all day and my makeup stays on perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was using a more expensive gel when I stumbled upon this product on amazon while searching for a less expensive place to buy the gel I was using. This hydra b gel works just as good if not better than the expensive one I bought from my dermatologist. The seller ships really quickly and offers such a good price hope this product is always here on amazon from this seller. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been researching on skin products with hyaluronic acid. I was using another product with less hyaluronic acid and it&#x27;s been working for me for a while, so I look to this product for more hyaluronic acid. My skin has improved dramatically with less breakouts than when I was using my old product. As the instruction said, this product should be used with another moisturizer, especially during winter time.</li>
    <li> I have old skin. I have been using these three products for 7 months and find the results very satisfying. The products are easy to use and simple to apply after cleansing your face. My skin is healthier in appearance, softer to the touch and less noticeable wrinkled around the eyes and mouth.  For the price these products seem to produce results.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. If I didn&#x27;t try it, I would not have believed it to be so good! It erases the lines under my eyes and it tightens my skin. It is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used! Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love this product as it truly works. I had a severe skin burn located on my left thumb. This burn left a very ugly scar. After about 20-days I could see a remarkable healing transformation with the scar. Today it has fully healed and you would never have known that I had a severe skin burn.</li>
    <li> Initially, I felt like a bit of a dupe when I got talked into using serum. But, you know what? My skin really does feel lightyears better: consistently moisturized, but not oily. I also am pleased to have taken the time to search for and try out this brand from Cosmetic Skin Solutions. It&#x27;s less expensive than the Skinceuticals version and the product always arrives quickly and safely packaged. Reviewing my purchasing record, I&#x27;ve clearly become a regular customer, so here&#x27;s to lasting relationships!</li>
    <li> I use this around my cheeks, eyes, and mouth, but one could use it over their entire face or neck and chest. It&#x27;s super moisturizing and feels cool when applied. I will always keep extra bottles on hand, so I don&#x27;t run out!!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the result. I have acne pore combination skin and very dry around my cheek and nose area recently, used this twice a day made my skin feel so smooth and hydrated. Excellent product and very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after purchasing the sample set and I am convinced that this product works. I have been using it on my face, neck, and hands. I see dramatic improvements and appreciate CSS for making this product available at an affordable price. My skin use to be very dry prior to using this product. My skin is very sensitive to certain ingredients, and after research the ingredients in this product are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Tip: Apply the Hydra B5 gel with a day cream for best moisture absorption/retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I saw improvements with this product after about 4-5 days of use. My eczema on my hand is also improving drastically with the help of this hydra b5 gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU CSS! Please never stop making this great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Loyal convinced customer, Melody</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product again and again.  I usually use Babor serums and have for years but I throw this one in the mix every few months and get great results.  It helps keep my skin moisturized, soft and radiant.  You can&#x27;t beat for the price.</li>
    <li> I like to use this product with the C&amp;E Serum because it provides the moisture my skin needs.</li>
    <li> So I have been using Skin Ceuticals for 6 years.  Seeing the price for same product Hydra B5 Gel by Cosmetic Skin Solutions LLC  I almost feel out.  Was like can this be true?  So far so good, I did notice that the Cosmetic Skin Solutions formula is a little thicker.  So I threw away my box to my Skin Ceuticals Hydra B5 Gel so I can not compare all ing. yet.  Online I can not find all exact ing. for both products.  So next time I will order Skin Ceuticals Hydra B5 Gel just so I  can compare all ing. on back of box.  This will satisfy my weirdness with seeing what the differnce could be in these products.  Because the price of Cosmetic Skin Solutions is un real.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the B5 for about 3 years. I use it every day during the winter, and alternate with the Phloretin and the Phyto. It provides the extra hydration I need during the cold months. I was worried that my sensitive skin would have to adjust to it, but I&#x27;ve never had any irritation (with this or any other CSS product).</li>
    <li> I have purchased B5 this product is not hydrating at all, it drys your skin.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> compares well to Skinceuticals.  Adds a bit of hydration and softness when needed.  Smells nice and does not make face oily.</li>
    <li> The product works like a charm I have super dry skin and I peel constantly (need to drink more water lol). it stops my peelying and makes my skin better. The only problem is I hyave some oily skin and when used alone some pimples apper (not crazy but I notice an increase, just in case I dont have lots of pimples or acne but sometimes one pops put this makes this increase a little; also any cream make the same effect for me so is not the product fault is my skin). I keep using it because I found a solution I used an moisteraid cream but one that prevents pimples, etc and then aply this I need it because is the only producy I found that stops my peeling and really moisterized my skin :)</li>
    <li> Not seeing or feeling a difference with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and I use it to hydrate my skin. I also use their vit. C serum.</li>
    <li> This product  hydrates the skin keeping it fresh and vital looking. It is a great product. I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Glass bottle is broken！with the order of the other three B5 are intact but sold by Cosmetic Skin Solutions LLC！！！</li>
    <li> A product review has been submitted for VITAMIN C+E SERUM ADVANCED FORMULA +.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love this product, amazing results from daily use. Sensational&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product review has been submitted for HYDRA B5 GEL ADVANCED FORMULA +.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the texture and feel of B5 gel, makes my skin soft and supple. Thrilled with the results, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Hydra B5 Gel Advanced Formula is my favorite skin product. Hi-quality moisturizer without the weighted-lotion feel. This clear/clear lightweight gel/serum fits my active/athletic lifestyle. 5-stars+++!!!</li>
    <li> After completing several skin treatments to my face resulting from years of excessive sun exposure my dermatologist recommended that I start using a moisturizer and products containing Vitamin B5 and a Ferulic Acid to restore my skin. After initially using more expensive brands containing these ingredients it was recommended to me to try Cosmetic Skin Solutions by a friend who is a lot more knowledgeable about skin care than I. I could not be more satisfied with my switch to CCS. I use both the B5 Hydrating Gel and the C+E Ferulic Serum in the morning and the B5 Hydrating Gel again before bed. Both products spread ability is incredible. Actually now I no longer need to use a after shave in the morning. At 63 I never thought I would get compliments on my skin. Cosmetic Skin Solutions has a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference.  I used the whole bottle.  It&#x27;s a pretty bottle but that&#x27;s it.  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Compared to other brand name of this product, I can honestly to say that this product can make my skin moisture and reduce my wrinkles. I am strongly to suggest my sister to use it. She has ordered this product twice again because it make her skin looks more smoother and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I am almost done with the bottle and I don&#x27;t see any results?  It did not make my skin more hydrated or anything else for that matter.  It is also not super mosterisinf.  I feel the need to use another cream over it at night.</li>
    <li> Wow, fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I did not notice that this product helps retain moisture, like I read from the many reviews. I did use it on my face and my son&#x27;s face also, since he has extremely dry skin, and did not notice a difference. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great for the skin. I was introduced to this gel by a dermatologist and it is really making a difference.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has noticeably improved and will continue to use the gel.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt smoother and more hydrated. Can&#x27;t get enough of this product especially for the excellent price. Have purchased as gifts for several friends and they all love Hydra B5 Gel !</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s hydrating my skin, but it also makes my skin feel smooth and flawless!</li>
    <li> Will be ordering this again soon</li>
    <li> Great hydrating serum. 3 to 4 drops are sufficient for the whole face. No smell, quickly absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;You might want to apply an hydrating cream or sun protection on top.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me at all.</li>
    <li> Helps my skin to look and feel great.I feel beautiful and everyone says so.Skin never looked so fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I discovered this solution after a more expensive brand of the same product was recommended by a facial specialist. I loved it but was not willing to pay the price of the more expensive brand. When I found this Cosmetic Skin Solutions Hydra B5 Gel Advanced Formula on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. It worked just as well as the more expensive brand and I was sold. I have been using it for 2 years or more. It does hydrate your skin and that is badly needed in the very dry climate I live in. After cleansing, apply while skin is a bit moist and it soaks right in. Overnight and again in the morning is the routine I have adopted and my skin is smoother and softer, less dry than before I started using it. I can certainly tell the difference when I miss a day or two. Give it a try and see the difference it can make.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and my skin is much more taunt and free of subtle discolorations. I began wiping the excess gel onto the backs of my hands and the skin on my hands is now much more youthful in appearance! What a plus!! I knew it was helping my facial skin regain its youthful appearance but the same is now true for my hands! FANTASTIC PRODUCT! It will be a constant staple in my anti-aging arsenal.</li>
    <li> Love this product, this was recommended by my dermatologist. My skin is very sensitive and acne prone, but this gel provides the moisture and hydration without the sticky feel. I use this as daily part of my regimen.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the expensive version and so much cheaper. I love this product because I have oily skin and this makes my skin feel great and not greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product and use it in conjunction with Vitamin C 20% Serum + Ferulic Acid &amp; Hyaluronic Acid. The consistency of this product is thick so the droplets are large as they come out of the dropper. Because of this, I only use 2-3 drops, not the recommended 6.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this product and really like the way it enhances my moisturizing routine.  I use this with my other moisturizers and save this for the last step.</li>
    <li> This is the most inexpensive of all skin hydration products with hyluronic acid. I have been using this type hydration for at least 15 years with another brand at twice the priice. This is a bargain and it  has no bens  or other unfavorable, harsh chem so I consider it the greenest of hydrators.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an effective, complete and most importantly inexpensive way to accomplish great skin, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using their products for almost two years and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from oily skin and I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and pimples. I&#x27;ve tried different products online and from stores but had no found any long term results until I found Cosmetic Skin Solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit when I saw the prices at first I was relentless to try but decided to order a small sample just in case I didn&#x27;t like it. My first product was the Hydra B5 Gel which is amazing, is like you are wearing nothing on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that I was SOLD, couldn&#x27;t get enough of this products. And if you feel like I did, just order a small sample and give it a try. You won&#x27;t regret it. I promise you.</li>
    <li> Had just gotten the &amp;quot;more expensive brand&amp;quot; at my Drs. and came upon this, I like it SO much more-Well the expensive stuff is sitting unused, and I am re-ordering this. I also had gotten The Phloretin serum -found it on one of those no retail type of sites-which led me here. Plan on using them both forever!</li>
    <li> Hydra B5 Gel -- It feels wonderful on skin and is very moisturizing.  I would consider buying this product again</li>
    <li> my sister introduced this product to me, i use this everyday and i love it, it makes my skin nice and smooth</li>
    <li> I purchased this with minimal expectations. I applied after exfoliating my skin. While I did not see any drastic results, even after a month&#x27;s use, I felt like my skin was moisturized. Though for the money, I can probably get a less expensive moisturizing cream for the same results.</li>
    <li> I read that using hyaluronic acid is great for dry skin. I gave it a try and it made my skin breakout something fierce! I already have acne prone skin but, it was manageable. Because of the products I use I also have dull dry skin on my cheeks. I thought this would help. I literary woke up the next morning with at least 20-30 tiny little bumbs. I went to a doctor because I thought I had an allergic reaction or a rash. Turns out it was clogged pores. I strongly recommend taking to a dermatologist before investing in a potent product like this.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is so moisturizing and easily as good as one of its competing brands that is much more expensive!</li>
    <li> So how dries my skin up.</li>
    <li> Used to use the Skinceuticals retexturizing serum but switched to this to save on price. All ingredients identical. Works just as well! Wear to bed - also put on under bb cream for daytime moisture. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and I have used the Skinceuticals brand.  I find this product to be equal to the more expensive brand, at least for my skin.  It is readily absorbed and helps tone the skin.</li>
    <li> Like prescription-grade hyluronic acid. Instantly smoothens skin and helps moisturizer absorb into skin. I have less wrinkles than last year for sure</li>
    <li> Simple well priced product.  This isn&#x27;t a moisturizer.  I&#x27;m a male, and have found moisturizing products give I shine I don&#x27;t want.  There are a few I&#x27;ve found at Amazon that work really well. This product is great during the day.  Takes a little and goes a long way; absorbs very fast.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin that is chronically dehydrated. It&#x27;s been challenged to find something that adds a lot of moisture, without causing an oil slick.  Skinceuticals B5 Gel has literally transformed my skin over the last 6 months, so when I found this product with practically the same ingredients at half the price, I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right from the start I could notice a difference, and not a good one.  The slippery texture of the product felt the same, but when it went on, instead of absorbing, it sat on top of my skin and dried in like a very thin, slightly shiny film.  I was dismayed, but wanted to give it a fair shake, so I&#x27;ve been using it for month or so and am about 3/4 through the bottle, and will not be reordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I had high hopes for this product, I honestly feel that it adds NO moisture or any other benefit.  I know that it&#x27;s half the price, but I would rather pay twice the price for the moisture Skinceuticals B5 provides, than for this product that literally does nothing other than fool you into THINKING that you&#x27;re doing something good for your skin. Buy Skinceuticals B5 Gel or - save your money and another step in your regimen.  :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! My skin used to be dry and now that I apply the Hydra Gel twice daily it&#x27;s like a refreshing drink on my skin. I would definitely recommend this product regardless of skin conditions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many times and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of products for dry skin and nothing seemed to work! Recently I&#x27;ve purchased this and a bunch of other products and noticed how my skin has cleared and stop peeling! So I started eliminating some products to see which one made the difference and now I know it&#x27;s definitely this serum! It&#x27;s really great when you find something that gives you the skin you&#x27;ve always wanted + it&#x27;s totally affordable</li>
    <li> I was not expecting miracles when I got this, I bought two to have one for carry on. The product does not deliver what it promises and I frankly don&#x27;t think it has anything other than your simple hydraulic acid to provide some kind of initial moisture locking affect. Overpriced and ineffective. Hydration effects are 6 on a scale of 1-10 and then it dries somewhat tight on your face. I did not see any great skin benefits as a result of using this product even after using it every day, two times a day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  I have very oily skin and have tried numerous products to help control oiliness.....this works.  It also leaves my skin feeling firm and youthful.  I also use some of the other products and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I appreciate your fast, fast service and the product is good.  I have to write five more words!  Thanks very much!</li>
    <li> The product feels stiff in the skin and one needs to be very careful... tends to dry on the skin and leave a whitish visible residue. I didn&#x27;t like the way my skin felt after the application at all!!! I didn&#x27;t trash it just yet because I am thinking I can use it over the weekend, when I get to stay home. I will not buy this product again and I won&#x27;t recommend it either.</li>
    <li> Have been using for several months and have not noticed much of a difference to my skin yet. Not sure if I will continue use.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This product really did nothing for me. I didn&#x27;t notice a thing. I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and have combination skin.</li>
    <li> My first time trying it and absolutely loved it, it made my skin moist all day and looks healthy and glowing !</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and it does give a temporary plumping effect but you must use it right. Hyaluronic Acid can not be absorbed by skin. (hence people getting injections for the long lasting effect) - It&#x27;s best to put this &amp;#34;on top&amp;#34; of other moisturizers - don&#x27;t wear it under anything. Even makeup. It does give one a temporary plumping effect by attracting moisture to skin when applied topically. When used alone it can feel drying. It you put it on top of your moisturizer it will help your skin absorb that moisturizer more effectively. It won&#x27;t absorb in itself though. Just realize that and you will like the effects. If I want to reduce puffy eyes, apply a tiny bit of this over makeup at the top of cheekbones..plumping that part therefore reducing the appearance puffy eyes. If you have puffy eyes, i&#x27;d be leary of putting it directly under your eyes because of the plumping effect..could make that look worse if it&#x27;s a problem area for you. Usually it&#x27;s a loss of volume in your cheekbones combined with the loss of under eye elasticity in skin that causes this. At night, I apply this on top of my moisturizer starting with my cheekbones on down. forehead as well, sides of eyes..just not directly under. I did do that once and my eyes were double when it came to puffiness and looked like I lacked in sleep.</li>
    <li> Read the list ingredients and you will find it compares to mich more expensive products.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product made me break out.  That being said my skin is very sensitive and I had hoped this would be gentle enough for me.  No luck!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two years, it&#x27;s one of the things I cannot live without.&lt;br /&gt;Twice a day I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face after using Vitamin C + E Serum, it&#x27;s like food for my skin, I cannot survive without it I&#x27;m so sure.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in my skin but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.  It feels very nice going on.  It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and a little bit goes a long way.  I will update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I was looking into buying the Skinceuticals B5 Gel when a friend told me about Cosmetics Skin Solutions.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a little skeptical about buying a \\&quot;generic\\&quot;, but since I didn&#x27;t know how my acne prone skin was going to react to the product I decided to buy the cheaper version of the B5 gel to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and suffered from acne most of my life, therefore I have some scarring and dark spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the B5 gel for about 2 weeks now and all I can say is WOW!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is firmer, more even, brighter, the dark spots are fading, and I even notice some improvement in my acne scars. And the best part NO BREAKOUTS!&lt;br /&gt;I use the serum every day in the morning before my regular moisturizer and every other day in the evening (I alternate with Retin-A). It&#x27;s quickly absorbed by the skin and it does&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Caused my face to breakout. If you have sensitive skin or combination skin I would not purchase this item. I stopped using it after three days.</li>
    <li> I have been using B5 Gel, C+E Ferulic and Firming Eye Gel for several years. The B5 Gel is is the best moisturiser I have ever used, and leaves my skin feeling wonderfully hydrated. I use it together with  C+E Ferulic and Eye Firming Gel, and my skin has never looked better. The price is so good that it is well worth paying the cost of delivery to the UK. Thank you Cosmetic Skin Solutions.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever leave any reviews but this product is so bad that it made me write one. First of all, I am in my mid 30s. I have been taking care of my facial skin since I was a teenager. I have tried tons of different products from SK II  to grocery store products. I have never tried something as bad as this gel. It does not moisturize my face. As a matter of fact, it feels like I spread glue on my face. Right after it is dry, my skin looks dull and feels tight. I can see all the lines that I would never see with any other facial moisturizer. It is TERRIBLE. I would not recommend this product to anyone and I wish I could rate it as ZERO star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now once a day . I already notice my skin has less lines and is more even toned. I do recemend using a good moisturerizer as the serum does leave the skin feeling a little bit tight. But over all I&#x27;m hooked on this product!</li>
    <li> I did not see any different when use that gel, I bought the vitamin C from the same company and is EXCELLENT, but this best hydra B5 was not so good for me.</li>
    <li> I like to try new skincare and was hoping around looking for something hydrating after i noticed flaky skin on my cheeks. I tried numerous products claiming to boost the hydration but to no avail. Thats when i decided to come back to CSS B5 gel and it never disappoint me. The flakiness was gone in 2 days and i now know what really works</li>
    <li> Not sure what the irritant was. I have light,sensitive skin. I use this product on my nails instead of my face because of the breakout problem.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Hydra B5 Gel to use over Cosmetic Skin Solutions Vitamin C and E Serum.  The C and E serum is every bit as good as Skinceutical&#x27;s much more expensive C and E serum.  In fact the listed ingrediants are the same.  I&#x27;ve purchased three bottles of the C and E serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is to be used after the C and E serum and before a moisturizer.  It makes my skin feel very smooth and more firm.  I&#x27;ve only used this product for two weeks but I like it very much and if it performs as well as their C and E serum, it will become a staple for me.</li>
    <li> This serum is great. I have not found a serum that works like this one. I absolutely love it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Hydra B5 Gel keeps my facial skin moist, smooth and clear of sunspots and use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I will purchase it again. It was recommended by my cosmotologist.to reduce sun spots.</li>
    <li> Best product for the price. Moisturized and plumps up your skin like giving it a drink of water! Very light and absorbs fast. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> It firmed my skin and brightened my skin. Texture showed improvement after 2 months of using this. I will consider B5 for my skin.</li>
    <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin. I am on my first bottle of Hydra B5 Gel and can see difference in my skin - in less than a week. I use the gel in combination with the Vitamin C+E serum and the Day Moisturizing crème. The results are amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff with all of my heart. I use it religiously! very hydrating and no gross residue left over! perfection!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to try this product for the first time after using the Skinceuticals version for about a year.  I love the Skinceuticals product and tried this one only due to the cheaper price.  My first impression is that this is not as good as Skinceuticals, but I will try it a little longer.  This product is thicker (more viscous), and the order of ingredients is different.  They also list different names for the Hyaluronic Acid component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetic Skin Solutions ingredients: Water, Pantothenic Acid (B5), Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skinceuticals ingredients: Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pantothenic acid (B5), Phenoxyethanol.</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent for aging skin. I plan to buy this again. I was told to use skinceuticals, but I think this is just as good.</li>
    <li> I am only 30, but my skin is pretty sun damaged, so it might be that it is very hard for me to see the benefits of any product, but I finished the whole bottle, and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin. It is as wrinkled and saggy as it was before I started using it. It doesn&#x27;t do any damage, but I don&#x27;t think it justifies the price. Might as well buy a simple moisturizer, wear sunblock and forget about the fancy miracle promising expensive stuff, because they simply don&#x27;t do much. At least I haven&#x27;t had any luck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I did not find it particularly hydrating. HOWEVER, Cosmetic Skin Solutions Vitamin C+E SERUM ADVANCED FORMULA is FABULOUS.  I&#x27;ve been using the C+E serum for long time and I can really see how much it has helped my skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing product quality !</li>
    <li> Excellent gel to put on bare skin before other products.  It makes moisturizers sink right in to the skin.  Everything else works better when you start with this.  Bottle lasts a long time.  You&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
    <li> it gives that extra moisture that is needed especially in winter as well as being a good product that doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
    <li> The serum absorbs wonderfully and gives my 41 year old skin the moisture that it needs.  I am so happy to have found Cosmetic Skin Solutions.  They make outstanding products and have the best customer service department I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I started using this Hydra B5 gel about a month ago. I apply it after my C + E Serum by Cosmetic Skin Solutions and I LOVE IT!! Its so soft and smooth and plumps up my skin. My wrinkles are less noticeable and my husband and friends have been telling me that my skin looks great. I am turning 40 this year and I believe the combination of the two serums is reversing my age and keeping me young.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this. The only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me break out! I keep coming back for more!</li>
    <li> Just started it and saw a MAJOR diffference in hydration and I live in Vegas and suffered major lip dryness...it healed my lips and improved my skin&#x27;s hydration dramatically....I will keep buying this for sure...I like how easy it spreads on too...I like the dropper method as well...</li>
    <li> This gel I let me send from the U.S. to Germany for about 2 years. I use it after the Antioxidant Vitamin C + E and before the day cream. It has a great consistency. The skin feels soft and well cared. I only need 2-3 drops, because the gel is so productive.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Keeps my skin nice and smoothe all  day. Never again will I forget to order more before I have to be out of it.</li>
    <li> This is no comparison to Skin Ceuticals. It is too gel and the skin does not soak it in. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this did anything - was not very moisturizing. I don&#x27;t know what the purpose of this was.</li>
    <li> Cannot tell what this does? See and feel no difference  maybe my mind is playing tricks on me because this product looks nothing like the skinceuticals product of similar description I previously owned</li>
