<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This a wonder fragrance for spring and summer time!</li>
    <li> I have had this perfume may times before and know the scent very well.Unfortunately the top of the bottle was leaking, like it was tampered with and it definitely does not smell like Mambo!!! Thank you Amazon for refunding my money but very disappointed in this product!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume so got it at the cheapest price ever offered.</li>
    <li> Hard to find but Amazon found it for me!&lt;br /&gt;I buy this for my 2 daughters. They love it. I even have a bottle wear it sometimes. My grandson loves it when I wear it. He&#x27;s 5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance and when I tell them who its by, they give me this strange look like &amp;#34;huh?&amp;#34; LOL. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this it last all day and is still on your clothes the next day. Smells really good.</li>
    <li> This just smells so sexy I love love love it</li>
    <li> This is the perfume I have been looking for long time. It is a bit strong (not in bad way); stays long and smells very nice and refreshing. I am going to be a regular customer of this item.</li>
    <li> Love. Love love this scent.</li>
    <li> A very saucy scent.  Not up to the Claiborne sophisticated svents.  It is okay, but nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> I had Liz Claiborne fragrances before but never Mambo. I wanted to try something new and just based on the reviews I decided to purchase it. I have no regrets. It has that nice flowery undertone. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> My aunt loves this stuff. I bought it for her for christmas.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this cologne, since I couldn&#x27;t sample it. I am very please with the scent and the price.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great. I purchased this for a Christmas present for my employee, it smells so good I purchased one for myself.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this for my boyfriend for Christmas, however, it&#x27;s more a gift for me than him :) Love it!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this poetically-sexy perfume around the age of twelve ((Almost 8 years ago)); it has remained one of my most beloved fragrances ever since that first moment. This fragrance is sweet, deep, sensual, and musky without being overpowering. And a few spritzes can &amp; usually do last you the whole day//night. Excellent for super special occasions, black tie events, or whenever you want to feel extra sexy. Shopping around isn&#x27;t really necessary--the 1.7 oz of Mambo is $30-$35 at the drugstores, so--PLEASE! --take advantage of this price! ;7</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this perfume for the first time at smells good. Not my favorife, but it will do for now. I will buy again soon. Thanks</li>
    <li> This quickly moved into the #1 spot for my all time favorite perfume. Straight to the top.... love it. Very tropical &amp; yet, not too sweet. Stays on for several hours... with a nice twist.... Just a little bit goes a long way. :)</li>
    <li> This was authentic- smells so gooooood!!</li>
    <li> I had always loved this fragrance from the moment I sampled it.  I was not disappointed when I finally bought it years after sampling it.  My only wish it that it was more long lasting, that is why I gave it only four stars.</li>
    <li> This perfume is the best. The scent lasts all day and since it is hard for me to get Ciara Femme Fatale anymore I will buy this perfume everytime I can get it for a good price before they decide to discontinue it. I have been wearing this scent since it came out, not to say I dont have other perfumes that I love but Mambo is my favorite and always wil be.</li>
    <li> Smells good i got it for the wife and she loves it to</li>
    <li> I just found a new favourite! This perfume not only smells nice but it has staying power. My order was delivered promptly and was well packaged too. Thanks guys :)</li>
    <li> As lovely And spicy and satisfying a scent as I remember even after 10 years of having worn it. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this scent! Smells the same as it did YEARS ago when I first discovered it! It&#x27;s not my go-to, every day perfume but when I do wear it, I am not disappointed! It just smells, sexy. I like to wear it during the summer, or a night out.</li>
    <li> The best perfume I have ever bought. Deliver was right on time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a scent for older people- and I&#x27;m 24 so it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. I want something sexy/young.</li>
    <li> The scent is not what it used to be..This new scent is very strong and overwhelming, even with just a small spritz..Very disappointed after searching a very long time to replace what I had..</li>
    <li> been using this product a long time. very reasonable. get compliments all the time. last all day. would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I gifted this perfume along with another one to my wife on the V day and she likes both of them especially this one. This particular one has a flowery fragrance that is not too strong but will last for a while and comes in an attractive reddish yellow volcanic bottle. It looks really good on the dressing table and my wife uses it everyday to work as it is not too strong. I paid $14.99 for 3.4OZ which is not bad at all compared to other big fragrance stores. Would definitely buy it again for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This is ok.  I&#x27;m seeing the price now at around 20 and it&#x27;s worth that price.  It has a musky scent.  Best for the night out on the town.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the original aroma.</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> Everywhere I go, people ask me what I am wearing and rave over the fragrance!  Thank you Amazon for bringing a great fragrance at a great price to my door! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of this perfume. loved how fast it shipped as well</li>
    <li> Always loved this fragrance. Can&#x27;t find in stores. Great price!</li>
    <li> ...Mambo is both appropriate for young women and more mature women.  Mambo has a strong, but not overpowering scent that is most suited for evening wear.  One of Liz Claiborne&#x27;s best perfumes, it is both sexy and smooth.</li>
    <li> The perfume is weak. You spray it on and you can&#x27;t smell it anymore. I think it smells okay but does not last. I don&#x27;t remember Liz Claiborne making anything this weak. I wonder if it is the original. It was cheap but not even worth the price.</li>
    <li> my wife is in charm, she love this cologne, and the price is right, great purchase, recommended for all the ages</li>
    <li> The product came on time and exactly how described in the description. I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> love the scent. packaged well.  Fast shipping.  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> excellent smell!!!!great Price</li>
    <li> I have been buying this fragrance for so many years - I can&#x27;t remember!!  I consistently receive complements from people!</li>
    <li> I like it! I hope my fiance does too, since it was one of her gifts! I always try to get her a fragrance neither of us have smelled before each Christmas. Risky? Yes.... but so far it&#x27;s worked out well.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly :) Been a fan of this since I first used it.  I always get compliments.  Works well with my body chemistry.  YAY!</li>
    <li> Smelled this from my girlfriend and loved it, she told me she would get me one and she did... But we fell out and she kept it... Heffa!!!! Love this perfume, five stars, but my friend would get no stars</li>
    <li> My FAV perfume by far!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it any where else except on line, it&#x27;s what I expected</li>
    <li> This is the exact scent I was looking for. I can&#x27;t believe I found it!!!!!! And the bottle size is more the enough!</li>
    <li> The colonge is nice, It just doesn&#x27;t  last long.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and I love this perfume! It&#x27;s my favorite! I&#x27;m glad I found it again and I will be ordering again soon</li>
    <li> I still love this perfume til this very day! Smells so good! I always get compliments when wearing it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite summer evening fragrance.  At first sniff, it&#x27;s a bit after-shavey, but ripens to the most lovely tropical fruit/spice blend.  I wore it last night to a large-ish event. The room was warm, making the florals other women were wearing seem too sweet.  Mambo was exactly right.</li>
    <li> Its a nice perfume to have. one spray and you are good to go</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and I can no longer find it in the stores, so as long as it is available on Amazon, I will be buying it and using it!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments that I smell good!  ALL THE TIME!    I have used this for years &amp; still love it!</li>
    <li> Lovely spring and summer scent.  I believe this one was made before Paris Hilton&#x27;s Tease parfum.  To me they smell so similar it&#x27;s striking.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed wearing this parfum although it did not seem to last as long as the Tease parfum on me...I know I shouldn&#x27;t compare them, but the scents are so similar...&lt;br /&gt;When purchasing in the future I would purchase Paris Hilton&#x27;s Tease before this one...I got this on sale or clearance, and the bottle is bigger than the Tease parfum.  But for staying power on me, the Tease wins...</li>
    <li> A light scent, get a lot of compliments, have worn for years.</li>
    <li> I bouth it for a friend and she loved it. Lo compré para una amiga y le encantó.</li>
    <li> Excellent price... My wife really likes this perfume, so it worked out great!!!😍 I didn&#x27;t have to hassle with the store crowds either!!!</li>
    <li> I wore this years ago then I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores. This arrived quickly and packaged well.  The scent is very similar to what I remember. What I used to wear may have had a slightly &amp;#34;sweeter&amp;#34; scent. None the less, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It was all that I thought it would be. I love it; the package was received in a timely manner. I was very Happy.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  Great scent.  Lasts long time on skin.  Highly recommend this scent.  This is my favorite Liz Claiborne scent.</li>
    <li> I feel so sexy and it really smells so good</li>
    <li> IF your into a strong scent where perfume is concerned then search no further. You can smell it from a mile away</li>
    <li> This perfume is my absolute favorite!  I always get compliments when wearing Mambo.  It&#x27;s so nice &amp; convenient being able to get it through amazon.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this perfume! I&#x27;ve bought this for her year after year. It&#x27;s a great gift. :) :) :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift. I had smelled it on a female colleague and thought it was sexy. Wife on the other hand did not take to it at all. It has a smokey, dark, earthy...fragrance to me. Her, not so much.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to find and when i do find it can be very expensive.  This was a deal of a lifetime! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Great  price  &amp;  fast  delivery</li>
    <li> It was ferfect ivlove it</li>
    <li> Great, the product came in the mail quickly (like within 2days) full and smells great!</li>
    <li> This perfume is ME! Love the subtle spicy/sweet scent</li>
    <li> its a pity that this is a discontinued fragrance.... there is no time and place to use this... you can use it for every occasion.... its not too loud and give off the most sexy sultry feminine scent.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent but not long lasting. I will not purchase it again.Good luck . And I cannot recommend it to my friends. The scent is not long lasting</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the real deal. It was perfume in Mambo bottle. It smelled like watered down white diamond. Refund was easy.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE, GOOD PRICE!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember what this perfume smelled like but I bought it anyways &amp; am very pleased!  It smells pretty &amp; is nice for summer weather.</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent and gets compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Liz Claiborn&#x27;s fragrances I love but, this perticular one is very hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was very excided to find it here.&lt;br /&gt;I was leery at first in ordering this product, because I felt it might would be old and have a musky smell;&lt;br /&gt;however, before I even sprayed it I could tell it was fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Yes,I would recommend this to anyone knowing it is such a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> This was my signature scent in high school. I&#x27;m glad to have it back in my possession. It brings back some great memories.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! I always purchase this item when i run out &amp; have received many compliments on it. A great gift..</li>
    <li> Great product,great service</li>
    <li> Mambo doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I remember.  It has a strange sort of undertone, almost smells like strong brewing tea, but I remember it smelling more musky. Great price for the large size, although I don&#x27;t plan on wearing it much.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product on the past (at perfume stores) and I know perfectly well how the perfume smells. Delivery was as promised, the product was well protected in the package and even when I opened it; it looked like &amp;#34;Mambo&amp;#34;. To my dissapointment, discontent and disbelief I had been sent something that smelled like a men&#x27;s perfume. It was very upsetting to say the least. I don&#x27;t use it on myself, I can&#x27;t!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice on a woman has a sweet but not overpowering scent. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it. Fine</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed compliments from others when I wear it but must confess it is something that I don’t wear just any day, but tend to save it for special occasions.</li>
    <li> Every single time I wear this I get a complement. It is the most sexy scent ever. The bottle I have at home is almost gone and it was a gift to my mom years ago, she didn&#x27;t like it but I loved it and now I need to buy another bottle because it&#x27;s my scent. It takes me back to so many good places and memories. Will forever be my fav perfume</li>
    <li> Love this!  Wish it was a tad stronger, but I have had compliments on this that meant a great deal.  Just a gorgeous scent.</li>
    <li> This perfume is hard to find! I&#x27;m happy to find it at such a good price!!!</li>
    <li> This is my wife favorite fragrance but finding it in department stores has been more of &#x27;a miss&#x27; event. Finding it at amazon in time for the holidays was great. Happy wife! Smiling husband!</li>
    <li> Mambo is my favorite perfume of all time and I was very disappointed in when I recieved it. I have not submited sooner becasue I did not know how to get ahold of anyone. When it came the boxs was open there was no lid and it would not spray out. at the bottom of the bottle there was a pin hole where the bottle was leaking I think that is very unprofessional</li>
    <li> This fragrance is so different but yet its smells so good and soft and sweet. It could also be a unisex fragrance because there is a cologne smell to it. But it is sweet and soft enough for a woman/younger woman to just fall in love with it! I love it and Can&#x27;t wait to purchase my mom a bottle of this!!</li>
    <li> One of my old school favorites ;-)</li>
    <li> Great value. Price per ounce cut in half.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, was fulfilled sent to the estimated dates, loved the price and quality. I recommend it to all, it smells yummy.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to wear every day. I am an Opium woman but wanted to try something different int he warmer weather. The first time I wore it, I had a compliment from a young man. WOW  it was worth it and for the price...why not??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased based on reviews of woodsy scents. I dont find its as woodsy as I usually like but its fine for daily wear and very pretty bottle.</li>
    <li> All was perfect very good product</li>
    <li> WIFE LOVE IT,TOO STRONG FOR ME</li>
    <li> I received a fake cologne, I want my money back</li>
    <li> this is my cent i love it and its worth every penny use to wear this in my hoe days brings back memories</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff , constant compliments all day. men and women ask me what are you wearing.scent works well on anyone, for me this last all day. wish it was still sold in stores.</li>
    <li> I love it.. I get soooooo many complements when I wear this!</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT I ORDERED!  MAMBO BOTTLE SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE.  SMELLS HORRIBLE!</li>
    <li> This is pretty good. Musty scent. Stays with you. May be a bit mature for some noises. I am however mature.</li>
    <li> Good price for this size!  The scent is wonderful.  I wear it in the fall.</li>
    <li> This cologne is light, but floral. Good price.</li>
    <li> Never Used this but I wanted to try something new. So I just read reviews and hoped for the best. I just got it today and I love it! Great for anytime of the day</li>
    <li> I was truly satisfied with the purchase of the Mambo Parfum unlike another order that was made where I got counterfeit parfum scent.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I first came across Mambo in 2003 and from then I have been HOOKED. This perfume is absolutely delicious. It lasts the whole. Suitable for day or night. I would recommend this perfume any day.</li>
    <li> Cologne must be great, I purchased for my daughter six years ago- she has requested it every year for her birthday since!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful scent&lt;br /&gt;This is a real bargin&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful bottle and scent</li>
    <li> I love Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN MY PERFUME MADE IT TO THE HOUSE... BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS PRODUCT FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> Have always loved Mambo but it has been difficult to find in most department stores.</li>
    <li> This may be a counterfeit for all I know, but usually a designer fragrance is not as inexpensive as this was and has a large scent that lasts all day.  I&#x27;ve only worn this for 2 days, but I had to refresh 2-3 times each day.  Even when I first spray it on the scent is very soft.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong I don&#x27;t want people to smell me coming from a mile away, but I do want to smell the designer flavor without any hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said and done the scent is nice so we&#x27;ll see what the final thoughts are, but for me it&#x27;s a bit of a wait and smell.</li>
    <li> Im dropping this review because I did not receive this item, not because it is a bad  brand or choice.&lt;br /&gt;Several attempts to complain about it has failed and when I was leaving the US, I wanted to request a return slip in case it arrives in my absence, but it says highly flammable items cannot be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend is yet to receive it so where is my stuff i paid for?&lt;br /&gt;Does that mean one should NEVER buy from 3rd party sellers? Did someone else sign for my stuff? Im confused. Pls help as I cannot review a product I did NOT receive.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped promptly.  I love the frangrance and it lasts a long time.  Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I have had Mambo before and I love it!! Not sure what happened to this bottle but it doesn&#x27;t smell right. It smells watered down or old and I can barely smell it on me after a half hour. Won&#x27;t buy again from here.</li>
    <li> Smells great and long lasting</li>
    <li> I started wearing this perfume years ago and it&#x27;s still my favorite today!  It is strong when you first spray it but by the end of the day, the smell is still noticable.</li>
    <li> My 44 year old Daughter simply LOVES the scent of this perfume. Yes, I will be ordering it again, possibly in June. The price is &#x27;Just Right! &#x27;. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the soft scent! It is not over powering at all.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great find! Inexpensive, but matches the big names! Mambo is a really good smell and I love it.</li>
    <li> this was one of my long time favorite scents, and I am so happy i have it again. everyone asks me what it is when i wear it</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance it has a wonderful scent and it stays with you all day long and i will have to get more soon.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the perfume, it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Love it. It was just as advertised</li>
    <li> great buy! no regrets!</li>
    <li> the perfume is pretty good but it&#x27;s just too strong for me but I like the bottle my cousin used to have it so maybe that&#x27;s why I got it</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product in a local store, but in a smaller size. When I got it in a bigger size, it seems to me like the intensity of the scent was weak. I still like it though! But I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the smaller size from now on.</li>
    <li> Love it. Have made repeated purchases. I wear it to work and have gotten many compliments!  Stays on all day!</li>
    <li> I love me some Mambo. Sexy &amp; intriguing!</li>
    <li> This a wonderful product one that I am well pleased with. I would refer family and friends to purchase this item. Also, my delivery time was great. I encourage you to try it, I promise you want be disappointed.</li>
    <li> After purchase I found product cheaper at a local dept store. Great perfume/ great subtle scent, just a little over priced.</li>
    <li> My favorite frangrance!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this perfume so it was a great buy and for that much money I got a big bottle so when I run out I will be buying more</li>
    <li> My wife has used it for years.  Great perfume!</li>
    <li> great scent - i would recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself as I am venturing for a scent with oranges.  This was shipped quickly and arrived well secured package.  The bottle is pretty and slick to look at and is sturdy shape to hold on to while spritzing.  The initial first spritz it immediately reminded me of Elizabeth Ardebs Sunflowers which I used to wear a long time ago.  But after the spritz settles, then I can smell a hint of vanilla, and maybe some caramel or something sweet.  Not overly sweet smell, it has a refreshing smell but not as bright as the Sunflowers perfume.  The downside and reason for two stars off, it does not have lasting stay power at all.  It fades very quickly, it could be due to it being summer and the heat and humidity but even on my clothes, I can barely scent the perfume.</li>
    <li> I am sure this will not be available much longer, because I really like it.  Just like I love Spark my Liz and it is no longer available unless you want to pay $150 per bottle.  Too much for my blood.</li>
    <li> Good price and the GF loves it</li>
    <li> had neve smelled it on womens thought it was as good as males but its not althought its alright c(:</li>
    <li> I love this perfume &amp; I find it hard to purchase in stores. It did take a little longer to receive thru snail mail but I did finally receive &amp; I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I&#x27;m very happy I purchased it!! I will be ordering more soon. Thank U!! Also, it was a great price.</li>
    <li> not my typical cologne but i&#x27;ll wear it for work. I don&#x27;t really like the smell it&#x27;s not sweet enough for my taste. it smells good but not what I like. I will not buy it again</li>
    <li> Perfect product. Super fast shipping. Will return for all my scent needs!</li>
    <li> ..مررررره يجنن&lt;br /&gt;ريحتو غريبه بس حلوه و فيها شوي ياسمين ،،&lt;br /&gt; انصحكم فيه ، من سبع سنوات و انا استخدمه ..&lt;br /&gt;ثابت جدا على الملابس و الجسم&lt;br /&gt;وزنو خفيف وما يلخذ مساحه في الشنطه</li>
    <li> The perfume smells of alcohol and the fragrance does not last at all. An indication that the item has been on the shelf for a long while.</li>
    <li> The product is great.....the aroma is great and I have received many compliments.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really like the smell or the fact that the smell only lasts a short period of time. Gave it to my mother and she likes it somewhat. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> On time, looks good, my sister will love it...</li>
    <li> Love it, would recommend</li>
    <li> My mom wore this one day and smelled so good!  I had to ask what it was.  I ended up ordering some for myself</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and gets&#x27; many compliments. She has been looking for it for a while at a reasonable price, and was finally able to find it. Product arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Mambo makes me happy! This beautiful parfum is a lively tropical scent that creates a lovely atmosphere when you wear it. I had it years ago but I couldn&#x27;t quite remember the fragrance so in a way I took a chance by repurchasing it now. However I&#x27;m so glad I did! If you like to smell delicious and desire a boost of fragrance energy this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and anywhere I go, people would ask me what perfume I am wearing. The scent is especially sexy with a hint of elegance. It&#x27;s not very strong but you can really smell the tinge of sultriness. I wear it every day and I love that a few sprays can last the whole day...even overnight!</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Bought as a gift.</li>
    <li> My wife did not like it. Found it too strong.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for my favorite perfume</li>
    <li> Very nice clean spicy scent. Wife loved it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but I don&#x27;t hate it. Good price.</li>
    <li> This fragrance mixes well with my body chemistry. Its a real bargain.</li>
    <li> My wife love this fragrance.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews on this perfume,  I LOVE IT!!  Super sexy and exotic.</li>
    <li> My favorite everyday perfume of all times, for a great price!</li>
    <li> LOVELY FRUITY SMELL!!  I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!  I have worn it for over 8 years and its hard to find anymore because I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore.  Needless to say, it&#x27;s a very reasonable price and I constantly get compliments on how I smell.  I will wear this as long as I can find somewhere to purchase it!</li>
    <li> This cologne is really great. I used it before and thats why I ordered it and the experience is what I had expected. Wasn&#x27;t dissappointed at all.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Soon as im out i&#x27;ll be getting more!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent!</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend&#x27;s birthday present. It smells feminine, clean, and fresh! This is a great gift for young or older ladies.</li>
    <li> I love the way it lasts all night , smells so yummy</li>
