      <li>could be better.  </li>
      <li>love the Boston Advance Multi-pack.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a reason why the storage solution for this set is what I call Slimy, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
      <li>The Advance Solution is much better than the Simplicity version and it met my expectations.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and would not use anything else.  </li>
      <li>The price on this product from Amazon is much better than any price in my area of the country from what I can see.  </li>
      <li>figured this was a better buy.</li>
      <li>sam&#x27;s club has better price.....</li>
      <li>I love that I can get my Boston products here in a multipack.</li>
      <li>And in a ratio that&#x27;s close to how I many I need.</li>
      <li>It has the right size containers and is at a good price.</li>
      <li>Products are good -- transaction was quick and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I wish Amazon would insist on more accurate pictures for any products sold.</li>
      <li>The blue solution feels great.</li>
      <li>Cost was like getting free cleaner.</li>
      <li>Boston advance is the best cleaning and conditioning for my Hard contacts.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good deal, compared with buying these products individually at the store.</li>
      <li>The style of cap could be a very important issue for older folks with arthritis.</li>
      <li>Package arrived quickly and included everything advertized - two 4oz bottles of conditioning solution and one 1oz bottle of cleaner.</li>
      <li>Exactly what you would get at the store with full expiry remaining</li>
      <li>The red solution does a great cleansing job (I compare against my wife who used to just use Renu type cleansing) and mine definitely get a lot cleaner.</li>
      <li>The first 2 times, the products weren&#x27;t even usable with my contacts.</li>
      <li>The bottles are the new pop-top style, not the screw lid style as shown in the photograph, but I don&#x27;t think Boston makes the old style bottle any more.  </li>
      <li>the best or only solution for hard contact lenses.</li>
      <li>At first I was worried about authenticity, but confirmed from Baush themselves that the product is legit, worrying about the 4oz bottles versus the 3.5 ounce bottles found in big box stores.  </li>
      <li>The generic brand lets my contacts get foggy quite easily.</li>
      <li>You really need to go with a trusted brand---a brand recommened by my Doctor.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like buy 2 on sale and get the third free.  </li>
      <li>They works really well with the ortho-K lenses.</li>
      <li>that is a real test for me...</li>
      <li>really?...</li>
      <li>service is fast and reliable.  </li>
      <li>really?</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and will certainly purchase again from Amazon</li>
      <li>I wear rgp contacts and the wetting drops keep them comfortable all day long</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this contact solution combo my whole contact-ridden life (about 10 years now) and can&#x27;t find it in normal stores.</li>
      <li>I have used this RGP lens cleaner and highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>The cleaner works strong and sometimes he complains it takes extra time to thoroughly cleanse the lens and later irritate the eyes.</li>
      <li>I like that it also comes with a new contact lens case in each box.  </li>
      <li>It is cheaper to buy it here if the shipping is free, as opposed to elsewhere, especially from the drugstore chains, but only if there is not a shipping charge.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This particular box has lasted me about 6 months, and so far, no issues.</li>
      <li>go through this regularly, and the problem always is running out of the cleaner first.  </li>
      <li>It correct near sightness.</li>
      <li>I booked marked this</li>
      <li>The photo is TERRIBLE and not at all accurate, but the product is GREAT.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the caps depicted in the picture are not the ones on the actual product, which are the pop top kind, and which are difficult to open and close.</li>
      <li>Came exactly as described with the current round bottles.  </li>
      <li>Its completely worth it to get the the name brand version of hard contact solution.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described with the current round bottles.  Expires in 2017.  As long as the price stays the same, I will definitely order again in the future.</li>
    <li> Item was as described. No complaints. This is possibly the lowest price I have found for it.</li>
    <li> Used these solutions with my gas perm contacts for years. This combo pack is a big savings over local stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack since I needed both the solution and the soap (for hard lenses).  This was the best price I could find on line (and out).</li>
    <li> could be better.  making pairs of products.</li>
    <li> Cost was like getting free cleaner.</li>
    <li> the best or only solution for hard contact lenses. My son started to wear CRT (ortho-K) correction lenses. It correct near sightness. The lenses are hard lenses. This set of products has cleaning solution, storage solution. They works really well with the ortho-K lenses.</li>
    <li> Its completely worth it to get the the name brand version of hard contact solution. Helps keep my hard lenses from getting foggy. The generic brand lets my contacts get foggy quite easily.</li>
    <li> Easiest way to get this product which is the only one for hard contact lens users; it&#x27;s the only one my doctor recommends for me.</li>
    <li> It is cheaper to buy it here if the shipping is free, as opposed to elsewhere, especially from the drugstore chains, but only if there is not a shipping charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go through this regularly, and the problem always is running out of the cleaner first.  So If you buy this and then get an additional bottle of cleaner, you are good to go.</li>
    <li> The doctor recommended this product for my son&#x27;s sleep-time-wearing (Ortho K) contact lens. The cleaner works strong and sometimes he complains it takes extra time to thoroughly cleanse the lens and later irritate the eyes.</li>
    <li> This brand beats all others and the three pack is a bonus on the great price.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo14HQSFD698F61]]Label from Amazon purchase says 4 oz bottle. Same size bottle from Target says 3.5 oz. really?... no. really? figured this was a better buy. nope.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Boston gas permeable cleaning, soaking and wetting products satisfactorily for years with no problems and I recommend them as does my optometrist.</li>
    <li> this save me a lot money! works good for my kids. I booked marked this so I can buy it again.</li>
    <li> love the Boston Advance Multi-pack.  The travel sizes are great for airline travel, and convenient for pockets or purses..  Have used this product for years; wearing rigid contacts without any problems.  Order was received within a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I have used this RGP lens cleaner and highly recommend it.  I have faith in Baush &amp; Lomb when it comes to products for my eyes and trust them.  You do not want to put any product in your eyes.  You really need to go with a trusted brand---a brand recommened by my Doctor.  It does what it states that it will do.  It cleans the lens perfectly and also disinfects them with the cleaner solution.  The price on this product from Amazon is much better than any price in my area of the country from what I can see.  Highly recommend and will certainly purchase again from Amazon</li>
    <li> Boston advance is the best cleaning and conditioning for my Hard contacts. It has the right size containers and is at a good price.</li>
    <li> Good quality products and package,  good value added, always shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I love that I can get my Boston products here in a multipack. This is much much cheaper than the usual stores and I don&#x27;t have to look for a sale all the time and I never run out of solutions</li>
    <li> Use to get this at Costco but they quit carrying it. Hard to find things like this for &amp;#34;Hard Lenses.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these fluids for decades. My only complaint is that the caps depicted in the picture are not the ones on the actual product, which are the pop top kind, and which are difficult to open and close. I wish Amazon would insist on more accurate pictures for any products sold. The style of cap could be a very important issue for older folks with arthritis.</li>
    <li> sam&#x27;s club has better price.....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best solution I&#x27;ve use for my contacts. I wear rgp contacts and the wetting drops keep them comfortable all day long</li>
    <li> My wife had been buying these retail and paying about  $8-9 per bottle. The cleaner are typically 3.5oz. This effectively saves us about $10 and we are getting 4oz instead of 3oz. Huge win for our budget.</li>
    <li> This brand was recommended to me by my optometrist for my CRT lenses (gas permeable). This particular box has lasted me about 6 months, and so far, no issues.</li>
    <li> My brother just loves it !!!</li>
    <li> all is ok but the cap on a small bottle is driving me crazy! it is so tight and i open it with effor every morning and then push it down so hard to close... ah... that is a real test for me... also I thought there is going to be three different liquids, but there are only two - for cleaning and for storing. no liquid for rinsing as a description said</li>
    <li> Great product and vendor. Two thumbs up!!!!!</li>
    <li> Package arrived quickly and included everything advertized - two 4oz bottles of conditioning solution and one 1oz bottle of cleaner.</li>
    <li> The web says 2 4oz bottles of conditioning solution and a 1 oz bottle of cleaner.    The box contains a single 3.5oz bottle of conditioning solution, a 1oz bottle of cleaner, and a tiny bottle of rewetting solution.    Since this is my third failed try to order contact supplies through Amazon, I&#x27;m just going to keep what I got and take the loss, but it&#x27;s frustrating.  The first 2 times, the products weren&#x27;t even usable with my contacts.</li>
    <li> Package arrived promptly and included everything advertized - two 4oz bottles of conditioning solution and one 1oz bottle of cleaner. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good deal, compared with buying these products individually at the store.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned after the other reviews, as to whether or not I&#x27;d be receiving the proper product.  But it was perfect - two 4 oz bottles of soaking solution, and one 1 oz bottle of cleaner.  The bottles are the new pop-top style, not the screw lid style as shown in the photograph, but I don&#x27;t think Boston makes the old style bottle any more.  Amazon Prime got it to me perfectly.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, very good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this contact solution combo my whole contact-ridden life (about 10 years now) and can&#x27;t find it in normal stores. So glad to find it here! The red solution does a great cleansing job (I compare against my wife who used to just use Renu type cleansing) and mine definitely get a lot cleaner. The blue solution feels great. You know it&#x27;s a good solution when you go to pop in the contact and you don&#x27;t feel it! This stuff gets that job done well.</li>
    <li> The photo is TERRIBLE and not at all accurate, but the product is GREAT.  Exactly what you would get at the store with full expiry remaining (I bought mine in May 2015 and expiration date is out to 2017).  But what I am mostly shocked about is the price...it&#x27;s like buy 2 on sale and get the third free.  I can&#x27;t get this price locally...ever.  So I am back and stocking up.</li>
    <li> The Advance Solution is much better than the Simplicity version and it met my expectations.  It came with two bottles  of solution and one bottle of cleaner.</li>
    <li> Great value.  At first I was worried about authenticity, but confirmed from Baush themselves that the product is legit, worrying about the 4oz bottles versus the 3.5 ounce bottles found in big box stores.  Expires in mid 2017, plenty of time for me to cycle through them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there is a reason why the storage solution for this set is what I call Slimy, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I have unintentionally left my gas permeable lens on my finger when it didn&#x27;t make it in the lens container instead, thereby almost loosing it. I guess that is my issue, but it&#x27;s why I only gave it three stars since a lens costs $250 a piece. The cleaner part of the set is normally washed off under the tap, so make sure you close the drain!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using both for years and my  Optometrist&#x27;s recommendation. I like the fact that the 2 related products are combined. And in a ratio that&#x27;s close to how I many I need.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and would not use anything else.  This multi-pack is a very good bargain.</li>
    <li> Products are good -- transaction was quick and smooth.  Thanks</li>
    <li> The price is an excellent value compared to stores.&lt;br /&gt;The service is fast and reliable.  Product arrived packed well and without damage.</li>
    <li> I have used Boston products for my contacts for years. It is an excellent product. This bundle was a bargain. 2 bottles of wetting solution and 1 bottle of cleaner will usually about $11 each. At $23, this was a bargain</li>
    <li> These are a lifesaver when traveling, for stashing in your desk at work, for overnight trips.  I like that it also comes with a new contact lens case in each box.  Good quality product that I have used for over 20 years!!  Recommended by my eye physician, also.</li>
    <li> Each item costs around $11 in my neighbourhood, so this is the best deal I can find.</li>
    <li> Great prices and convenient to purchase together.</li>
