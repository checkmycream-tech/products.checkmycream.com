      <li>I was very pleased with the quality of the mascara, since I am used to high end ones.  </li>
      <li>It glided on smooth and did not leave any clumps, goops or gobs.</li>
      <li>Feedback should be offered freely, and this product just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>my primary concerns</li>
      <li>I like how it applies and doesn&#x27;t flake, however it is not waterproof or smudgeproof as stated on the package which is as important as no flaking.  </li>
      <li>I like how it feels light</li>
      <li>A great product, and it was better than I expected.</li>
      <li>So far, I love it!</li>
      <li>As I get older, my eyes have become more sensitive, and I sometimes have issues when I apply a new eye product,  However, I was happy to see that I did not have any irritation from this at all.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes and have tried many hypoallergenic mascaras and nothing comes close to this product.</li>
      <li>Like that it was gentle on eyes but didn&#x27;t lengthen my fine eyelashes</li>
      <li>as most people do, which makes it hard to find a good mascara with a lot of money in the trash in the meantime.</li>
      <li>Nice application but not enough to build up lashes.</li>
      <li>I put on two layers and was pleased with the length and thickness the mascara added to my natural lashes.</li>
      <li>100% natural, 85% organic, vegan, AND gluten free!</li>
      <li>I even use a pretty heavy eye moisturizer (which could promote smudging) and find that this mascara does not smudge the way I have experienced the &amp;#34;leading brands&amp;#34; smudging.  </li>
      <li>But overall, this  mascara is definitely all natural and all wonderful!</li>
      <li>I LIKE THE CONCEPT VERY MUCH</li>
      <li>I found the mascara to be exactly what I wanted .</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara!  </li>
      <li>I finally found a gluten free mascara that does not flake off during the day!</li>
      <li>It gives a really full lash and also does not smudge like many other products I have tried.</li>
      <li>I like a nice dark mascara to help draw attention to them  and highlight them.  </li>
      <li>and I need something gentle.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smudge much anyway.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, ALL OF THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CHEMICALS.  </li>
      <li>Gentle on my skin.  </li>
      <li>also it gives a great dramatic effect for lashes ..</li>
      <li>Tends to wear off pretty easy and leave dark circles.  </li>
      <li>Shimarz is really going to hit it off with these natural and vegan products!</li>
      <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t..........recommend highly.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wear mascara normally because it irritates my eyes.  </li>
      <li>: you can rest easy knowing that it is natural, partially organic, vegan and gluten free.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes,  </li>
      <li>I highly suggest this product to anyone who has sensitive eyes and is looking for a product to help with that.</li>
      <li>I bought this mascara to try as my eyes are very sensitive</li>
      <li>This is every bit as good as the super expensive stuff - thick and goes on smoothly, and you don&#x27;t need 5 coats of it,</li>
      <li>I much prefer an actual brush like the one used in this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Applying it was what you&#x27;d expect from a high quality mascara.</li>
      <li>With the very primitive package and very short brush handles this product is far from any quality product.</li>
      <li>I ve sensitive eyes..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m REALLY picky when it comes to mascaras, especially mascara brushes.</li>
      <li>The only thing I want to comment on really is the fact that this does come sealed with labels.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I finally found a gluten free mascara that does not flake off during the day! Yay! I will be ordering more of this product!</li>
    <li> Love the color and texture. Not clumpy or sticky.  But it does smudge a bit and not quite water-proof...which I found out after few pollen-induced sneezes and watery eyes from seasonal allergies. It doesn&#x27;t run though, just gets a smokey eye look, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on beautifully, comes off easily and looks good; the problem is I purchased it because of the claim of Smudge Proof.  It is not smudge proof on my eyes.  I have tried it three times and once putting powder on before applying in hope that would help with the smudging.  It still smudged</li>
    <li> Gentle on my skin.  Tends to wear off pretty easy and leave dark circles.  So, I don&#x27;t use moisturizer around my eyes and only apply to my upper lashes.  This helps.  Transitioning to all organic makeup is a journey.</li>
    <li> I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THIS 3 1/2 STARS.  I LIKE THE MASCARA.  I WISH IT WAS DARKER AND MY EYELASHES LOOKED FULLER AFTER APPLYING IT.  IT DOES GO ON EASILY AND IT DOES COVER THE LASHES IN THE OUTER CORNER OF MY EYES BETTER THAN MOST BRANDS.  MENTALLY, I AM COMPARING IT TO ESTEE LAUDER SUMPTUOUS EXTREME WHICH GIVES EYELASHES A THICK DARK EFFECT.  HOWEVER, ALL OF THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CHEMICALS.  I DO THINK THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD FOR WOMEN WHO WEAR CONTACT LENSES.  I LIKE THE CONCEPT VERY MUCH</li>
    <li> I like how it feels light yet you can still see eye lash definition, but it still smudges, not as messy as other.</li>
    <li> No clumping, did not flake.  My mind was at ease knowing I finally had a mascara that did not have preservatives, not tested on animals, no chemicals.  Thank you for making this healthy product.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I tried another natural mascara I bought on amazon and it would burn my eyes so bad when they would start to water a little if I was driving home for the sun going down that I would need to pull over and wipe them. I couldn&#x27;t see at all! This mascara is way better and goes on very nice. So far, I love it!</li>
    <li> This mascara is actually as advertised.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes nor does it flake or smudge.  I am extremely pleased with the product itself &amp; the product itself deserves 5 stars.  However, after only 12 applications, the product seems to be drying up already. As a licensed aesthetician, I do not pump the wand into the tube, nor do I leave it sitting out open.  I don&#x27;t know if the drying up is normal or if I got a bad tube, but the product itself is great.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara!  Goes on easily w/o clumping. Doesn&#x27;t seem to smear or make your eyes look black throughout the day! And it washes off easily! I&#x27;ll be a fan of it! Gluten free! Yay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an eye infection last year and a bacterial infection this year - getting older I guess, so I have to go to hypoallergenic eye makeup.  This is every bit as good as the super expensive stuff - thick and goes on smoothly, and you don&#x27;t need 5 coats of it,</li>
    <li> YES!!!  Finally a mascara that is not filled with chemicals but also does not flake, clump or smudge!  I even use a pretty heavy eye moisturizer (which could promote smudging) and find that this mascara does not smudge the way I have experienced the &amp;#34;leading brands&amp;#34; smudging.  I am very happy with the results of the added length to my lashes and will definitely buy again (and have told many friends about it as well!).&lt;br /&gt;Attached are 2 photos.  One with more heavily made-up eyes, and the other with just mascara and nothing else.</li>
    <li> If you want amazing lashes with organic products, this is the best! I have tried a few other brands, but even after multiple layers (which you have to apply even with this mascara) I wouldn&#x27;t have longer looking lashes. It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look fuller, but natural and long which I prefer. Great mascara!</li>
    <li> 100% natural, 85% organic, vegan, AND gluten free! This mascara applied easily and added some length and volume to my lashes. This mascara didn&#x27;t cause any clumping either. After wearing it for a day I didn&#x27;t notice a single flake of mascara on my face. It&#x27;s a great product to use for someone with sensitive eyes or someone that wears contacts. The ingredients in this mascara (Chamomile, Coffee Powder, Rice Powder, Sunflower Seed Oil, Vitamin E, oregano, thyme, cinnamon, Rosemary, Goldenseal, orangeroot &amp; yellow puccoon, Lemon Peel, Grapefruit Seed, Vanilla) are all ingredients you can pronounce. No harsh chemicals, no parabens. It has nourishing and conditioning ingredients to help take care of your lashes. You&#x27;re getting multiple benefits in one. It came off easily with makeup remover and I didn&#x27;t have to rub hard on my eyes at all to remove it. Shimarz is really going to hit it off with these natural and vegan products! I am highly impressed. *sample provided*</li>
    <li> Like that it was gentle on eyes but didn&#x27;t lengthen my fine eyelashes</li>
    <li> Amazing product, gives lashes length and volume. Good consistency, smell. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I have to be careful with putting any oil or moisturizer around my face while wearing this. but it doesn&#x27;t smudge much anyway.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom as a mother&#x27;s day gift and she loves it. :) She has struggled with other mascaras due to the fact that she has very sensitive eyes, and she would frequently suffer from painful irritation. Other natural mascaras that I&#x27;ve used tend to run pretty badly, or otherwise not quite hit the mark as far as quality (the exception to this is the mascara from 100% pure, but it&#x27;s frequently out of stock and costs more than this mascara). This has proven to be just the mascara that she needed, and I&#x27;ll be ordering some for myself once the current mascara I&#x27;m using runs out. ;) Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> I found the mascara to be exactly what I wanted . It  goes on nicely . Please advise what mascara remover you recommend as the current one I use isnt working well.  I will definitely buy this product again and will recommend it to my friends .</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and have tried many hypoallergenic mascaras and nothing comes close to this product. My eyes don&#x27;t burn or itch or dry out and it isn&#x27;t clumpy. I highly suggest this product to anyone who has sensitive eyes and is looking for a product to help with that.</li>
    <li> I like how it applies and doesn&#x27;t flake, however it is not waterproof or smudgeproof as stated on the package which is as important as no flaking.  I have very sensitive eyes,  as most people do, which makes it hard to find a good mascara with a lot of money in the trash in the meantime.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the natural mascara. . Goes on smudge proof..</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara to try as my eyes are very sensitive and I need something gentle. The good news is, I&#x27;ve worn it twice now, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. The downside is it smears very easily, at least on me, and I had to apply many coats to get it to look like I was wearing mascara at all. The company emailed me asking for feedback, but told me not to post a review less than 4 stars without contacting them directly first. I didn&#x27;t appreciate that and I don&#x27;t like solicitations for good reviews. Feedback should be offered freely, and this product just isn&#x27;t for me. Its not bad, but not great either. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m REALLY picky when it comes to mascaras, especially mascara brushes. I don&#x27;t like formulas that flake (well, who would?), or that apply looking goopy and create spider lashes. I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of the thin, plastic applicator brush that looks like it has spikes coming out of it. I much prefer an actual brush like the one used in this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Applying it was what you&#x27;d expect from a high quality mascara. It glided on smooth and did not leave any clumps, goops or gobs. I put on two layers and was pleased with the length and thickness the mascara added to my natural lashes. After wearing it all day, I didn&#x27;t notice a single flake or smudge. When it came time to remove, it easily came off with my usual make up removing cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;The best part: you can rest easy knowing that it is natural, partially organic, vegan and gluten free.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest product evaluation.</li>
    <li> This mascara is just what I wanted.. I love that the wand is shorter and not &amp;#34;all out there&amp;#34; like most of the ones sold are!  It is easy to use and is the perfect product for my overly sensitive eyes!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mascara. It was easy to apply and no clumping. I really liked that I did not have to keep adding layers to get a nice look. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> I could not wear it longer than one hour and had to cleaned it.  I do not know why It is so irritating to my eyes. With the very primitive package and very short brush handles this product is far from any quality product. I cannot understand why it has so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> Great mascara with no goopiness!  I can&#x27;t wear mascara normally because it irritates my eyes.  This mascara doesn&#x27;t..........recommend highly.</li>
    <li> how long this small tube of mascara will last remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like a longer wand for application. Safety and non-smearing product&lt;br /&gt;were my primary concerns so this product fill the bill.</li>
    <li> Nice application but not enough to build up lashes. Truly does not irritate my eyes. Will probably use it on bad eye-allergy days.</li>
    <li> As I get older, my eyes have become more sensitive, and I sometimes have issues when I apply a new eye product,  However, I was happy to see that I did not have any irritation from this at all.  The brush is not too thin, but thick enough to help apply and separate the lashes when you put it on.  I like a dark mascara, and this definitely met that necessity.  I have brown eyes, so I like a nice dark mascara to help draw attention to them  and highlight them.  This mascara did not clump, or flake off during the day.  I was very pleased with the quality of the mascara, since I am used to high end ones.  And for those who like the Vegan and Cruetly Free aspect in a makeup product, then this is for you!

    <li> Love this mascara!!! It doesn&#x27;t clump or irritate my eyes  Will buy more!!</li>
    <li> great beautiful simple mascara, I notice the smallest little smudging under my eye when i get really sweaty or if my eyes get watery. But that&#x27;s what you can expect from a natural mascara. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara, the formula is non-irritating.  I am not a big fan of the brush, but I can make it work.  I would purchase again because I have found that the organic mascaras prevent my eyelashes from falling out.</li>
    <li> I ve sensitive eyes.. So it is very hard to me to find a mascara that doesnt irritate my eyes , I found this mascara to be very gentle on my eyes , doesnt cause any tearing or irritation .. also it gives a great dramatic effect for lashes .. I m using it twice daily , so I think I m going to need to purchase another one soon ! Recommended</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!! Not only does it look great on, it nourishes your lashes as well!! The size of the wand is perfect, not big and bulky!</li>
    <li> Great mascara! It applies smoothly and the wand is great for fuller, individualized lashes! The only thing I want to comment on really is the fact that this does come sealed with labels. However, the labeled are stuck on the seal instead of the tube itself. When you remove the seal, you&#x27;re left with a blank black mascara so you have to remember what it is. But overall, this  mascara is definitely all natural and all wonderful! Absolutely no clumping. Product was supplied for my honest review.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only worn this mascara wands but I have to say it stayed on my lashes and not under my eyes. I love the fact that it is organic!</li>
    <li> A great product, and it was better than I expected. I will order it again. Thanks for creating a wonderful product that is chemical free.</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome. It gives a really full lash and also does not smudge like many other products I have tried. So far, so good! I recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and happy to apply on lashes guilt free :)</li>
