      <li>I feel good using it because is uses cranberries which is an anti oxidant and also an outstanding product for peeling off dead skin.</li>

      <li>I originally tried a sample smaller size of this product, and loved it so much, that I sought it out on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Would Highly Recommend!!!</li>

      <li>so use it while it&#x27;s fresh, but I don&#x27;t find this scrub special or outstanding after a few weeks use.</li>
      <li>The only thing is that the face feels to dry after using it, which is solved with a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and very large pores.</li>
      <li>It feels like a polish - a little sandy, but use gently, and it is amazing.</li>
      <li>I have been very lax about skin care</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this. I have rosacea and even though my skin gets red after scrubbing, (everything makes my skin red) I don&#x27;t feel any irritation or discomfort. My skin is completely smooth and my husband even noticed my nose being clear of annoying blackheads. My husband noticed, y&#x27;all. It is expensive, but I like to wait when it goes on sale and it is worth it to me since I&#x27;ve tried making my own and using other products that have not worked half as well.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week. It&#x27;s like getting mini-dermabrasion session! And it smells soooo good.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best exfoliater I have ever used.  It only take a small squirt, literally a dime sized dollop, to do my whole face...so the tube will last a long time. Plus it smells like grape kool-aid which is my favorite flavor.  I feel good using it because is uses cranberries which is an anti oxidant and also an outstanding product for peeling off dead skin. I have super dry skin so after I exfoliate, I use Skin Eternal Serum followed by Skin Eternal Cream from Source Naturals, also purchased here on Amazon. Using all three, I finally have a peaches and cream complexion with a very even skin tone.  I&#x27;m not switching any time soon.</li>
    <li> great scrub!!!  I love the ingredients used in this scrub.  it has a light berry smell, very natural.  My skin was polished and felt soft after using this scrub, i absolutly love it!  it goes great with the wine hydrating mask.  I think i am in love with Arcona after trying these products.  The tube it comes in is quite a nice size and you only use a tiny bit so it&#x27;s definatly worth it if you love to pamper your skin</li>
    <li> I like the texture and smell, but am happiest with the results of my dry flaky skin.  This really helps to remove the dead dry skin.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.  I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> This product I absolutely cannot live without! It is worth every penny! I use it anywhere from once a week in the summer and warmer months, to 3-4 times a week in the dry winter months. I have used it for a year and a half and cannot go without it. My skin hardly ever breaks out anymore. This is by far the best skin care product for my face that I have ever found. I will never try anything else! A 3.4 oz tube lasts me about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Wowie kazowie, this product does exactly what it says it will do! It smells wonderful, it feels good and it makes your skin glow. I love it, and I am so glad I took a chance and bought it. It is definitely worth the money- you really only need a little bit at a time.</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps my skin smooth and improves the texture.</li>
    <li> This product is simply fantastic. The color and texture are initially quite surprising: it is a grayish-purple color and very thick. It is made thick by the hundreds of tiny exfoliating granules. I have never come across an exfoliate that is so direct. It is not in some gooey and smelly mixture that you slather on your face. I especially appreciate how the product&#x27;s concentration of exfoliates is consistent throughout. This leads to an effective and even exfoliation of dead skin cells. Overall great product: utterly effective and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I thought I loved my Arbonne scrub until I tried this one!  This product is FANTASTIC and I am in love.  Instant gratification.</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended this in combination with Skinceuticals clay mask 2x weekly.  I have combination skin, in my early 30&#x27;s with the occasional blemish or two.  I can tell the difference if I skip my usual regime.  Smells great.  Really gritty, so a little goes a long way.  Using a few times a week this tube easily lasted me a year.</li>
    <li> Received it on time and when I started using it I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the product leaves my skin.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it regularly and get long term results. Amazing!!</li>
    <li> Yes the ingredients purport to be natural and there&#x27;s a 6 month shelf life so use it while it&#x27;s fresh, but I don&#x27;t find this scrub special or outstanding after a few weeks use. The paste has an odd, cloying fruit scent and the grit is soincredibly fine that it&#x27;s inevitable to get microscopic grains in your eyes when rinsing. I enjoy the Clinique 7 day scrub more even though I know the ingredients aren&#x27;t as organic.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product, but it seems to have a different effect for people. Even though I gave it some time so my skin would adjust, it never did...I just kept breaking out. Won&#x27;t be using this anymore. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> It makes may face and neck feel so smooth.  I use it every other day, and it is simply refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several months and I can really tell the difference in my skin. People out of the blue will comment on my skin. I only use a small bit every other day. The directions say to use much more, but I found I was wasting it. I ordered my second tube from Amazon since the price was so much better.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Arcona Cranberry Grommage at a spa where I was getting a facial. I love the whole line, but especially love this product. It is the best exfoliant/scrub I have ever used. I use this in combination with a home dermabrasion tool and it leaves your skin looking amazing! I have been very lax about skin care but as I have gotten older I realize I need to treat my skin better. Your skin literally glows after using this! I will be ordering more once I run out. I have incredibly sensitive skin and 95% of the products on the market irritate or make me break out. This product line is excellent for sensitive skin! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years now and what cant you say about it. I use it together with the Arcona White Ice at night and Gommage in the morning. It definitely leaves my skin looking and feeling fresh through out the day.</li>
    <li> Excelent product! The only thing is that the face feels to dry after using it, which is solved with a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> THE BEST face scrub. Beads are small and not rough. Smell is amazing. Much better price than Nordstrom.</li>
    <li> the best facial scrub on the market and the seller got it here super quick</li>
    <li> works amazingly, smells delicious, my skin is glowing, love it.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and my skin feels velvety when I use this. I do find it somewhat harsh, so i only a pea-sized amount a couple of times a week. I&#x27;m not sold on all of ARCONA&#x27;s products yet, but this one is a clear winner.</li>
    <li> I love to experiment with new products and this is one of the best scrubs I have used. It isn&#x27;t abbrasive like some scrubs that I have tried and it smells amazing! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and very large pores. This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and my pores are much smaller.</li>
    <li> I use a retina a product and when I start peeling heavily, this sloughs off the dead skin better than anything else I have used.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat sensitive, combination skin that is prone to breakouts (and I&#x27;m well-out of my teenage years). I was introduced to this product at a salon and it&#x27;s the first exfoliant that&#x27;s truly worked well for me. It feels like a polish - a little sandy, but use gently, and it is amazing. i love the scent of it, too. It&#x27;s a million miles from that apricot scrub everyone used when I was younger. . .</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of exfolliants, both prescription and over the counter, and this is the best BY FAR. I&#x27;ve always had bad skin due to PCOS. Now as my son is maturing he&#x27;s getting my  skin too. We both use this and it works miracles. Leaves skin soft and moisturized, and supremely soft, Removes and prevents blackheads. Not oily or greasy at all. Light sweet very pleasant scent,</li>
    <li> I use only Arcona line for my face and I love this whole line! I use this twice a week, I love how smooth my skin is after I use this product! The smell is amazing and I just love how clean refreshed my face feels after using this! Would Highly Recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Oh, this stuff is so good! I have to stop myself from using it every day, as you&#x27;re only supposed to use it 2-3 times a week. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s like sandblasting your face with cranberry dust and mango chutney.  People seem to love me more right after I use it.</li>
    <li> This product has an amazing scent and leaves my skin so soft after I use it! I keep it in the shower and use it two or three times a week. Gentle enough for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I just received this product.  Love it...fragrance is wonderful and Arcona is a great beauty product.</li>
    <li> because clinique uses microbeads (small plastic particles that are an environmental menace), i went looking for a new scrub.  i purchase a few different things that were recommended in an online article on the best scrubs that don&#x27;t contain the microbeads.  i am in my 40s and have been using the clinique exfoliating scrub for over 25 years and was loathe to give it up.  i am happy to say that i am satisfied to switch to arcona cranberry gommage.  it is pretty gritty and it smells amazing! it doesn&#x27;t give the same minty tingle as my old scrub, but i&#x27;m willing to give that up to honor the earth.</li>
    <li> I started using my wifes and quickly realized that this product was great for my face as well.  I use it a lot and it really works well for keeping my pores clear especially on my nose.</li>
    <li> Very effective scrub, especially if you like something quite thick and gritty.</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a product junkie and Arcona is definately one of my favorite brands!  This stuff smells good and exfoliates very well. Keeps my breakout prone skin smooth and soft.  I also like the Triad Pads, they&#x27;re great for travel and smell amazing!</li>
    <li> This product works really well to exfoliate your skin, and it smells divine! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> great on my skin. expensive but worth it</li>
    <li> Best exfoliator Ive ever used</li>
    <li> I use it every other day works well ,I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this several times and it breaks me out each time. I gave it to my sister because of all the good reviews I thought it was just my skin but she told me it broke her out after the first use. I liked the smell and the gritty feel of it but there must have been an ingredient that disagrees with my skin. I also did not find it to be particularly exfoliating, it seemed to add to my flake problem rather than remedy it, as well as leave a slight film which I suspect is what broke me out. I would not recommend it but I won&#x27;t throw it away so we are giving it to my cousin lol.</li>
    <li> Have used for years and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product a few times now and so far I am very happy with it.  I mainly chose the product because it is supposed to be an organic line; so an organic product for me that also works really well is definitely getting 5 stars from me!  The texture/grit is perfect for me; I really prefer an exfoliator I can feel working, however I can see how it might be a little too abrasive for someone with more sensitive skin.  Their is definitely a more fruity scent to the product, which is nice, however I don&#x27;t really know if it is &#x27;cranberry;&#x27; smells more like grape to me.  A little seems to go a long way so this bottle will probably last a while.  Skin feels great after using!  It is hard a little hard to wash off with a washcloth or in the sink, just because it is so gritty, so I prefer to use mine in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love Arcona! This works like a fine polish to the skin and when you wash it off your skin looks and feels so fresh and amazing. Plus, the smell is pretty fantastic!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It mskes my skin really soft!</li>
    <li> I originally tried a sample smaller size of this product, and loved it so much, that I sought it out on Amazon. What I loved is that this has a very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; grit to it. I have very sensitive skin &amp; I am allergic to Sulfur/Sulfa, so I have to be very careful what I put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) FINE Grit (Not like most Sugar or Salt Scrubs)&lt;br /&gt;2) Smells Good, and NOT too strong (does fade easy)&lt;br /&gt;3) DOES NOT clog pores - (I have tried other fruit seed hull &amp; Fruit Extact/Oil exfoliators in the past, and they always seem to clog my pores, NOT the case with this Exfoliator!)&lt;br /&gt;4) DOES NOT Irratate the skin&lt;br /&gt;5) This is a high quality product!&lt;br /&gt;6) NO LAUREL SULFATE!!&lt;br /&gt;7) A LITTLE - You ONLY need a little bit, like a dime size for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Expensive - But, if you are using this 1x a week, it should last a while)&lt;br /&gt;2) Difficult to find - I had difficulty finding this originally (and I doubt that issues has gotten better as Amazon shows only 4 In-stock as of 02/06/13).</li>
    <li> great smell and cleans the face without being abrasive. My face is soft and smooth after using. Love it!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite, MUST HAVE, Arcona products! Slough away dead skin and I swear it makes your skin glow after ONE USE.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face smooth.  Love the smell!</li>
    <li> Great product. It really gets the dead skin off your face to reveal a glowing complexion.</li>
