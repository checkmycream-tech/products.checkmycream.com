    <li> I love this this oil. It makes skin, hair and nails feel soft without appearing oily. You don&#x27;t need a lot. A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my stray hairs, and my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Its non-greasy and very moisturizing. What I love the MOST about this bad boy is that although it&#x27;s 100% Argan oil, the but smell is very sweet! I actually reeeally like the smell. I use this on my son&#x27;s checks after he walks home from school. His cheeks are red and dry from the chill and this oil works wonders on them.  I use this on my face after I wash, in my night time routine. It dries so quick that it fits in perfect with my night time routine. I paid for this item at a lower price but fully suggest buying at full because it&#x27;s such a good deal for argan oil!</li>

    <li> A new favorite product!!!  Fabulous for both hair and face!</li>
    <li> Argan Oil. What can I say this is a very good oil. I use this to put into my homemade hair butters. I have yet to use it on my skin except for to just &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; it because I normally just use it for my hair but I may add into some lotions to see how it works.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Argan oil is the best and this stuff is the real deal! The smell and the way it hydrated my gnarly beard can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> This is some awesome oil!  With my dry, split ends, dry skin, and nails, I was given the chance to test this Argan oil so that I could tell everyone about my experience with it....and I&#x27;m so glad I did!

I will definitely be buying this over and over again!</li>
    <li> used on my neck and hair helps keep smoother all day. don&#x27;t have smell and easy to use dropper</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nature Touch Moroccan Argan Oil for about a month now, and I love it.  It has made my hair shinier and more healthy looking.  I use the dropper to apply some to my hand each night and run my hands through my hair before I go to sleep.  I also rub several drops on to my nails and cuticles each night as well.  My nails have become stronger, and less prone to breakage.  I also apply this argan oil to the dry patches of eczema on my skin.  It has moisturized these patches, and made them less dry.  This is a high quality oil that is &amp;#34; 100% Pure,Organic,Cold Pressed,Unrefined &amp;#34;.  I am very happy with my purchase, and would definitely purchase this Argan Oil again.

    <li> this oil came very well packaged.  nice quality!</li>
    <li> Just what I was needing! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great for a variety of things! I&#x27;ve been using it for the ends of my hair and the skin on my knees and elbows. Very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I spent the long weekend on a lake &amp; the wind dried my skin &amp; hair. One application &amp; my skin is glowing &amp; looks great &amp; my curly hair is tamed &amp; shiny</li>
    <li> Perfect daily moisturizer after bath plus it can be use in my hair. Every woman must have this oil to keep their skin and hair always beautiful. I always loves products than  can be use in a many different ways. This will not only hydrate and nourish your skin but also can be use to other skin and hair problems like acne and split ends. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Simply wonderful argon oil. I used this oil on my hair to help with my dryness and split ends. My hairstylist suggested to me that after I shampoo and conditioner my hair that I&#x27;ll add a little of the oil and then blow dry my hair out. That gives it the shine. Now for the split ends after flat ironing my hair I add a bit more of the oil on the end of my hair. Works likes a charm! This oil is also great for mild eczema I have it on my arms and it helped it tremendously.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is amazing. I do have oily skin and hair(at the scalp, dry ends), so I was a bit leary on using this for my moisturizer. When I used it (right after my shower) it went on and sunk right into my skin-no oily residue. Even on my face. And the next morning my skin looked so healthy. I also use it in the last six inches of my hair, and it makes it soft and shiny. You do not need a whole lot. For the hair, about 5 drops (I have long hair) rubbed between my palms and then massaged into the ends of damp hair. Blow dry, and no more dry ends.

    <li> I have really dry skin and really dry hair so I need something that is going to do serious moiturizing. This is it! This argan oil is great on my skin. It lives my skin moisturized, soft and supple. I use it on my face and it not only moisturizes but helps my skin glow and helps with any dark spots. This oil is quickly absorbed and noy greasy at all. It has helped bring a new sleek shine to my hair andtook away the frizzies! I just love it! I am happy to recieve this product  to review. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and we both tried it. We found it to be silky smooth and very soothing. It absorbs into the skin quickly feels good and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I put some on an area of dry, irritated skin above my eye and it definitely helped to sooth and heal it. Very noticeable difference within a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> My hands have been very cracked and dry from washing baby bottles every day that I needed something more than lotion. When I was offered this Argan Oil to try for a great deal just to share my honest opinion and results,  my hands said YES please! After opening the package I immediately  put a drop on each finger tip and rubbed it in. This Natural Touch Argan Oil isn&#x27;t greasy and  soaked in quickly. This was nice because I was able to continue doing my normal daily tasks without leaving oil spots everywhere. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to show their skin some love.</li>
    <li> I have heard great things about argon oil and how it helps dry skin.  When I was given the chance to try this at a discount rate I was so excited.  I decided to do a test.  I put the oil on one arm and not the other.  I did this same routine a week and a half.  I could tell the difference between arms.  I decided to let someone else look and feel my arms to tell the difference. I chose my husband.  He did not know of the experiment so he was perfect. He felt both arms and asked what I had been doing to the left arm ( that had the oil on it).  He said it was so much softer than the right.  I started using it on the right arm so it could catch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is organic and all natural.  I love that it feels soft and smooth.  It is also good to use on you hair.  I love how it makes it soft.  I only put it on the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying it again.  However I think this bottle will be lasting a long time.</li>
