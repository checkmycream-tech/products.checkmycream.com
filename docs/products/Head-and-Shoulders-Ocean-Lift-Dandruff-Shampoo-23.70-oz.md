      <li>does a great job at making your hair clean, and yet very doesnt over do the job.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does a great job at making your hair clean and it even has real sea minerals to help your scalps condition improve.  </li>
      <li>What is more to ask for a cheap shampoo that provide you all you need.  </li>
      <li>definitely it is a good product with reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dandruff free for over a decade using this stuff.</li>
      <li>My scalp feels clean again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>24 full ounces is allot in a bottle of shampoo and you are getting two.</li>
      <li>Normally Costco has these but charge more.</li>
      <li>can be used for everyday use, and i mention again, great scent.</li>
      <li>I rarely have to use cortisone now too.</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of this scent and really wish I could find the original formula, or even something else that smells like it.</li>
      <li>no dandruff that is for sure, so apparently the stuff works.</li>
      <li>I used to love this product years ago when it had a blue design</li>
      <li>First of all you get a allot for your money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accumulated it to not shampooing enough, so I shampooed more often...</li>
      <li>it is much better then the regular scent of head and shoulders.</li>
      <li>No irritation from the H&amp;S like eczema people get from pretty much any scented thing they use</li>
      <li>It is good, i always like head and shoulders and using only one shampoo for many years at least 10+</li>
      <li>2 large bottles, I don&#x27;t need to worry about running out of shampoo for a while.</li>
      <li>Those brands just made my scalp even more dry and itchy!</li>
      <li>But the rising tide implied by &amp;#34;Ocean Lift&amp;#34; lets everyone know what you what you&#x27;re really in for: the morning wood of the shower stall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It even has real sea minerals to help your scalps condition improve.</li>
      <li>and you will see results quite fast</li>
      <li>and I really dont have eczema problems anymore.</li>
      <li>but the dandruff and itching got worse, while my roots became more and more</li>
      <li>The bottles are larger than what I expected, and the smell is nice (though ultimately I&#x27;d prefer a fragrance-free &amp; color-free version to avoid the \\&quot;unnecessary\\&quot; stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to clean very well.</li>
      <li>finally gave and used my shampoo that luckily I held on to before switching to H&amp;S and, bam, grease, gone,</li>
      <li>Smells much better that the regular and works the same.</li>
      <li>I ordered mine direct from Amazon (as the seller) and got the &#x27;real thing&#x27;, and it looks just like the photo shows.</li>
      <li>I had to rinse for a long time, and breathe out deeply, to feel better.  </li>
      <li>#34;What are those flakes in your hair?&amp;#34; My mom started getting me these shampoos and to this day I can&#x27;t live without</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t how much was gone but had to clean the mess</li>
      <li>haha, you can get this at supermarkets or even walmart, i&#x27;d advise only getting this on amazon.com, if you can&#x27;t get out of the house.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 14 year old boy with dandruff.</li>
      <li>My 13 year old uses it now too and likes the scent as well.</li>
      <li>I can remember one humiliating moment back in high school where a boy I had a crush on asked me, &amp;</li>
      <li>The primary negative I might give it would be the price &amp; use of \\&quot;unnecessary\\&quot; ingredients like fragrances and colors.</li>
      <li>This shampoo works great when the weather gets cold and dry.  </li>
      <li>It smelled like a strong menthol, which is not a pleasant smell for me, but I don&#x27;t see menthol listed on the bottle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Come on, everyone knows this is a great product and the new line smells great. I used to use it and the use my regular shampoo but now I can just use this if I want. It works great my whole family uses it.</li>
    <li> Head and shoulders is simply amazing. I&#x27;ve been dandruff free for over a decade using this stuff. Never a miscommunication.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo, great scent. does a great job at making your hair clean, and yet very doesnt over do the job. can be used for everyday use, and i mention again, great scent. not too pleseant to the eyes, but if you know how to wash your hair, you should know how to close your eyes. haha, you can get this at supermarkets or even walmart, i&#x27;d advise only getting this on amazon.com, if you can&#x27;t get out of the house.</li>
    <li> I have a dandruff problem and it is really annoying me.  I had spend months to look for a shampoo that would help solve the problem.  I finally found this Head and Shoulder Dandruff Shampoo.  All my dandruff is gone after a few application.  This is a great shampoo and the smell is really good too.  This shampoo does a great job at making your hair clean and it even has real sea minerals to help your scalps condition improve.  What is more to ask for a cheap shampoo that provide you all you need.  I would recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it&#x27;s really a good deal when I bought it.  2 large bottles, I don&#x27;t need to worry about running out of shampoo for a while.</li>
    <li> I suspect I got faked one. When I openned the package, I found the bottle has a purple lable rather than a blue lable like the official picture. I&#x27;ve uploaded a picture.</li>
    <li> I use like Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo, it always cleaned my scalp and made it feel refreshed but it contains sulfate which makes dry scalp worse. If you&#x27;re okay with sulfate then I do recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Good product, which is worth the price. I like head &amp; shoulders, and I use it for long time. It is a good deal~~</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 30 years.  I like it.  But who designed this latest bottle?  It is top-heavy and to open the cap, you need a screw driver.  Does anyone at at H&amp;S test these things?</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. The bottles are larger than what I expected, and the smell is nice (though ultimately I&#x27;d prefer a fragrance-free &amp; color-free version to avoid the \\&quot;unnecessary\\&quot; stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to clean very well. The primary negative I might give it would be the price &amp; use of \\&quot;unnecessary\\&quot; ingredients like fragrances and colors. I&#x27;d like to see a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; version of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a review saying they got a purple label and so they think they got a fake one. I ordered mine direct from Amazon (as the seller) and got the &#x27;real thing&#x27;, and it looks just like the photo shows. There&#x27;s also a review complaining of difficulty with the cap, but I haven&#x27;t had any difficulty with it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great when the weather gets cold and dry.  Relieves itching and cleans off well but when you get some in your eyes...ouch!</li>
    <li> The product is good. It&#x27;s a great deal. It is delievered in time. The product is in perfec shape.I will buy again if there&#x27;s such a deal</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old boy with dandruff. After a few applications all dandruff is gone. I love the smell of this shampoo. It smells great! Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and dandruff. I was told by my dermatologist that the two are very related. So, I thought what happens if I use this as body wash?? I had eczema really bad that winter and so I used this as body wash. I had ecezma on my hands, face, and arms. The eczema cleared up in two days! No irritation from the H&amp;S like eczema people get from pretty much any scented thing they use and I really dont have eczema problems anymore. I use this every other day in the shower and now I get to use all the other scented things I never could. If I feel my skin starting to get a really bad eczema irritation coming on, I just let H&amp;S sit on it a little longer in the shower. I rarely have to use cortisone now too.</li>
    <li> This seems to only work when I have short hair. Whenever it gets close to haircut time, my dandruff seems to come back. Not really sure why, as I massage my scalp in both cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works for short hair&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not work when I have longer hair</li>
    <li> I received the two-pack shampoo, nothing was wrong until I opened the paper box, one bottle had a broken lid, it was leaking very bad!!!!!! I didn&#x27;t how much was gone but had to clean the mess....&lt;br /&gt;Is this the reason why the price is low??&lt;br /&gt;I still like the brand, good product.</li>
    <li> First of all you get a allot for your money. Normally Costco has these but charge more. It works for my hair and its a good amount per bottle. 24 full ounces is allot in a bottle of shampoo and you are getting two. The bottle itself feels like good quality. Works better than other off brand crap versions like Safeway and CVS. Those brands just made my scalp even more dry and itchy! head and shoulders 24 full ounce pack of two ocean lift is a great buy I would recommend it. It even has real sea minerals to help your scalps condition improve.</li>
    <li> Smells much better that the regular and works the same.</li>
    <li> definitely it is a good product with reasonable price. I bought two when there was a discount and they were so great!</li>
    <li> It is good, i always like head and shoulders and using only one shampoo for many years at least 10+</li>
    <li> After using it three or four times, my dandruff is gone. I mean, like completely gone. It works. It&#x27;s science.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this shampoo/conditioner set. When I first got it, it was great... for about a week. I changed nothing other than my shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about two weeks of use I noticed my roots were getting excessively oily but the rest of my hair was staying the way it normally did, frizzy poof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accumulated it to not shampooing enough, so I shampooed more often... but the dandruff and itching got worse, while my roots became more and more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, today was enough. I was scratching my scalp raw and I just felt.. dirty. I&#x27;ve felt like I had an unclean head for a few days but kept shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally gave and used my shampoo that luckily I held on to before switching to H&amp;S and, bam, grease, gone, itch, gone. My scalp feels clean again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be searching for a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried head and shoulders years ago and found it didn&#x27;t help with my dandruff but wanted to try again... it helped with the flakes, yes, but everything else was unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing H&amp;S again.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have known this was shampooo only.  I thought it was shampoo and conditioner.  That was my mistake though.</li>
    <li> After trying so many shampoos I can truly say this is the best out their, use it on daily basis and you will see results quite fast</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders shampoo has worked well for me for years.  I didn&#x27;t see anything on the label for Ocean Lift that indicated it was a different formulation.  But when I poured it into my hand and on my hair, where it touched my skin on my face, it felt like a cold burning sensation.  The fumes that I inhaled also felt awful and I had trouble breathing normally.  I had to rinse for a long time, and breathe out deeply, to feel better.  It smelled like a strong menthol, which is not a pleasant smell for me, but I don&#x27;t see menthol listed on the bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband has used H&amp;S for many years and he&#x27;s got great hair, no dandruff that is for sure, so apparently the stuff works. My 13 year old uses it now too and likes the scent as well. I don&#x27;t use it, but love the scent. Great shampoo for the guys.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with my scalp; dandruff, itching...the works. I can remember one humiliating moment back in high school where a boy I had a crush on asked me, &amp;#34;What are those flakes in your hair?&amp;#34; My mom started getting me these shampoos and to this day I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ocean Lift is my latest favorite because of the cooling feeling, the smell, the dandruff and itch relief and how it makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been in the ocean without having to deal with sand in my bathing suit. I am hopelessly obsessed with thus product and totally recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband and I and we love the smell it is much better then the regular scent of head and shoulders.</li>
    <li> I searched all over for a shampoo with a purple boner to greet me in the shower each morning and by God, Head &amp; Shoulders delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; in Head &amp; Shoulders is actually a starfish arm. But the rising tide implied by &amp;#34;Ocean Lift&amp;#34; lets everyone know what you what you&#x27;re really in for: the morning wood of the shower stall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This shampoo does not smell like starfish or boners</li>
    <li> I used to love this product years ago when it had a blue design (like is in the product description). The scent of it reminded me of my beach vacations for some reason. In the past year or so they changed the scent of this shampoo along with the design on the bottle. Now it is more feminine smelling and comes with a purply-pink design (like is in the product picture). I am not a fan of this scent and really wish I could find the original formula, or even something else that smells like it.</li>
