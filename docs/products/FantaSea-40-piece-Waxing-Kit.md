      <li>So far this is my favorite!</li>
      <li>Ok, haven&#x27;t used it much yet.</li>
      <li>something about them is extra porous and really grips hair, I use it with a microwavable sugar wax and the combination is very effective.</li>
      <li>The FantaSea Muslin Strips worked good with the GiGi Honey wax, for any other GIGI wax</li>
      <li>Works great for small waxing jobs.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and they worked just fine.</li>
      <li>This actually makes epilation much more efficient than with paper strips.</li>
      <li>Will simply go to a craft store to get more sticks cheaper.</li>

      <li>The FantaSea Cosmetics 40 stick pieces and Muslin Strips Kit worked very well with my GIGI wax.</li>
      <li>They did very well.</li>
      <li>I messed up gloves sponges - my sink was very sticky because of this experiment.</li>
      <li>The porous nature of the muslin allowed the air on the outside of the strip to cool and harden the wax beneath the strip.</li>
      <li>I will give them 5 stars it came on time highly recomended</li>
      <li>... dry very quick and ready to fold and use again (for personal use of course).</li>
      <li>Comes new with everything it should include.</li>
      <li>Tehy worked and the package was complete.  </li>
      <li>The sticks are your normal waxing sticks, similar to popsicle sticks.</li>
      <li>First of all, the strips are porous and airy, due to the woven nature of cloth.</li>

<li> If your only doing your brows or small areas</li>
<li> they are soft and thin</li>
<li> It really makes the waxing process less painful, since it&#x27;s soft when you are taking it up; not like paper or plastic that is hard on the skin.</li>
<li> However, a few of the cloth appeared rather dirty with some brownish stain, which I couldn&#x27;t get it of even after washing.</li>
<li> These weren&#x27;t bad..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for waxing</li>
    <li> this is all I need to wax, the different width of the sticks helps when waxing areas such eyebrows..love it and strips are actual cloths which works great with the sally hansen lavender spa wax. These are the only products I need.</li>
    <li> I ordered the muslin strips after I ran out of paper strips in my Sally Hansen waxing kit. I ended up liking the muslin strips a lot. But you have to proceed differently with muslin strips than with paper strips. First of all, the strips are porous and airy, due to the woven nature of cloth. This is a very useful feature of these strips. The porous nature of the muslin allowed the air on the outside of the strip to cool and harden the wax beneath the strip. This actually makes epilation much more efficient than with paper strips. I am ordering muslin strips again.</li>
    <li> Ok, haven&#x27;t used it much yet.</li>
    <li> The FantaSea Cosmetics 40 stick pieces and Muslin Strips Kit worked very well with my GIGI wax. It got the job done. I chose this product because they were cheaper than the GIGI Muslin Strips. They did very well. The FantaSea Muslin Strips worked good with the GiGi Honey wax, for any other GIGI wax I recommend buying the GIGI Muslin Strips, the material that is made in the GiGi Muslin Strips is way stronger to pull all the wax off from the skin. The sticks were very good.</li>
    <li> The sticks break easy and the strips well the wax goes right through it very messy!! Would not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> I used to use these waxy paper things that I had gotten from a salon and these are so much better. they are soft and thin so the wax comes all the way off. I am so impressed and I just love these and will be ordering more</li>
    <li> cloths are flimsy, and not enough sticks.  Will simply go to a craft store to get more sticks cheaper.</li>
    <li> I got those strips because I thought it will be a great deal if I can wash and reuse them. I read a comment saying they can be washed easily. I tried to wash them with hot and boiled water, after I added soap too and it didn&#x27;t work . I messed up gloves sponges - my sink was very sticky because of this experiment. They are good strips but for the money the roll strips will be a better deal. I also like longer strips for my legs. It is easier for me. I won&#x27;t buy them again! The roll works best for me. Or please advise me how I can wash them!</li>
    <li> I made wax at home so needed this product. It&#x27;s really good. I will recommend this product to every one reading this .</li>
    <li> Works great for small waxing jobs. If your only doing your brows or small areas this waxing kit would be perfect. anything bigger your gonna need a bigger kit!</li>
    <li> These are great!  They adhere well to to the Gigi wax (honey) - I cut into smaller strips to get more out of them.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed;o)</li>
    <li> I have been waxing my face for many years and tried many waxing kits. So far this is my favorite! I love the cloth wax strips that are easy to tear and cut to the size I need. My favorite out of this pack was the long, thin wax sticks! It shaped my eyebrows beautifully!!! I have already put in another order.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Persian wax and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> i kind of picked these up without doing any research..I have sensitive skin and they worked just fine. great for waxing all over.</li>
    <li> I make home made sugar wax on my own  and remove my hair at home to save my money.&lt;br /&gt;So I was looking for only wax paper. This is good and works nicely. Sugar wax is very easy to make so please try it! you don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money at salon.</li>
    <li> the waxing strips work great... something about them is extra porous and really grips hair, I use it with a microwavable sugar wax and the combination is very effective. I fill the sink with hot water, and just place them in the sink as I use them, and then they are very easy to wash and re-dry hung over a towel on a wall rack... dry very quick and ready to fold and use again (for personal use of course).</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t bad..they work..i guess they are just not the muslen strips I am use to.  Tehy worked and the package was complete.  I like the variety of sticks to choose from.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the cloth strips in this kit.  MUCH better than the ones included with the wax I bought.</li>
    <li> The sticks are of rather good quality, and the cloths are pretty thick. However, a few of the cloth appeared rather dirty with some brownish stain, which I couldn&#x27;t get it of even after washing. Threw those away.</li>
    <li> Great product, variety of strips, reusable (best part!!!) and does a better job than paper strips. Would recommend without a doubt.</li>
    <li> It really makes the waxing process less painful, since it&#x27;s soft when you are taking it up; not like paper or plastic that is hard on the skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent tools used for the waxing kit, I had no problems with them. I would definitely recommend this to fellow amazon customers!</li>
    <li> Good, but don&#x27;t buy this if you buy hard wax. The muslin strips are unnecessary, and you get a pretty limited supply of waxing sticks. These are good to figure out the size of stick you would like. I just ordered 1000 &amp;#34;food grade&amp;#34; popsicle sticks from Amazon for $13 (they are smooth and even, perfect for waxing!). I will never need to buy these again, but I also knew that popsicle size works perfect for me! (upper lip and eyebrows)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for...would order again !!!</li>
    <li> I will give them 5 stars it came on time highly recomended</li>
    <li> I bought this as an add on to a GiGi wax kit that I bought off of here. I really didn&#x27;t need them, as the kit had everything I needed. I did open the package up. The strips are strong and of good quality. The sticks are your normal waxing sticks, similar to popsicle sticks. I will be using them when I run out of the ones that came with the kit.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. Comes new with everything it should include.</li>
