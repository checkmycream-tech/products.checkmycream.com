      <li>I have purchased many polishes from this seller and I am always satisfied with my order.</li>
      <li>I purchased 4 bottles and wonder if I should have purchase more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have many uses for this lovely color.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>I love this color.  </li>
      <li>It has a beautiful pinkish purple sparkle, but then at certain angles the light hits the orange sparkle and it&#x27;s seriously magical.</li>
      <li>We got are nails done in this color and loved it so much bought as many ad we could.</li>
      <li>I love the color and the way it looks in the light.</li>
      <li>It took 3 coats for it to be full coverage for me but is well work it!</li>
      <li>I received a lot of compliments on how pretty my nails were and how much everyone loved the color.</li>
      <li>but I feel like I need more than two coats to really get the desired effect.</li>
      <li>And I received it very fast!  </li>
      <li>I went back to the salon to get the name of the bottle so that I could order my own.</li>
      <li>The second coat gives you a good idea of what the color will look like, but three coats were really needed to get the color that the bottle shows.</li>
      <li>I was eager to try it as soon as I noticed that there is a distinct gold undertone in this primarily hot pink/magenta sparkly polish.</li>
      <li>While the polish appears to have that gold undertone, it is better described as seeming a deep orange at the right angle.</li>
      <li>Plus OPI stays on for a long time and dries quickly. :)</li>
      <li>Thanks again for your speedy shipping and it came in great condition as usual.</li>
      <li>It has been my favorite for several years and always gets compliments.</li>
      <li>This is why I call it hot pink/magenta.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Also, thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I really like the color</li>
      <li>came as described, fast shipping</li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain the skin as badly as other, more pigment-intense colors.</li>
      <li>THe color came brand new and doesn&#x27;t chip fast</li>
      <li>This color is gorgeous &amp; VERY hard to find, when I wear it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pink but orange depending on the light.  </li>
      <li>Fun color for something different to add to your pallet of colors.</li>
      <li>(The picture of the bottle above shows it pretty well in my opinion, but the nails in that picture can&#x27;t show the multi-tonality of this polish.)  </li>
      <li>It is truly a stunning polish and I will be buying a full-size bottle as soon as this small bottle begins to run out.   </li>
      <li>Removing any of these polishes with the microglitter is a little more time-consuming than your standard polish.</li>
      <li>I hesitate to call this Hot Pink because a.)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like hot pink</li>
      <li>It is more of a solid red/pink whereas the product I used previously had tinges of other colors that this didn&#x27;t have.</li>

<li> It is discontinued and I am so sad.  </li>
<li> So sad they don&#x27;t continue to produce it.</li>

    <li> I bought the Little Teasers set from Burlesque and tried each polish individually. I am in love with this polish! I was eager to try it as soon as I noticed that there is a distinct gold undertone in this primarily hot pink/magenta sparkly polish. Like the other polishes in this set, it has a microglitter that imparts shine rather than sparkle, and when you hold your hand in one direction the color is completely different than it is when your hand is held in a different direction. This calls to mind the paint on some cars that looks different when the car has passed. I hesitate to call this Hot Pink because a.) I don&#x27;t like hot pink and I like this color and 2.) it is not startling in the least. This is why I call it hot pink/magenta. the color is deeper than your typical hot pink but there is no suggestion of purple in this color at all, so it isn&#x27;t magenta either. The color goes on with less pigment than I would have anticipated; in fact it is quite sheer with only one coat and streaky. The second coat gives you a good idea of what the color will look like, but three coats were really needed to get the color that the bottle shows. While the polish appears to have that gold undertone, it is better described as seeming a deep orange at the right angle. It also appears a deep red at a third angle. (The picture of the bottle above shows it pretty well in my opinion, but the nails in that picture can&#x27;t show the multi-tonality of this polish.)  It is truly a stunning polish and I will be buying a full-size bottle as soon as this small bottle begins to run out.   Removing any of these polishes with the microglitter is a little more time-consuming than your standard polish. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain the skin as badly as other, more pigment-intense colors.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect Thanksgiving/Fall Color.  It&#x27;s pink but orange depending on the light.  I receive a lot of complements on it.  Wish this was a regularly stocked color.</li>
    <li> I love the color and the way it looks in the light. It has a beautiful pinkish purple sparkle, but then at certain angles the light hits the orange sparkle and it&#x27;s seriously magical. Plus OPI stays on for a long time and dries quickly. :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color! It is discontinued and I am so sad.  THe color came brand new and doesn&#x27;t chip fast I love it</li>
    <li> I had this nail polish put on when I had a manicure two weeks ago. Everywhere I went I received a lot of compliments on how pretty my nails were and how much everyone loved the color. I went back to the salon to get the name of the bottle so that I could order my own. I just love this nail polish!</li>
    <li> This color is gorgeous &amp; VERY hard to find, when I wear it I ALWAYS get loads of compliments &amp; ask where I got it!</li>
    <li> I love this color. The way it shimmers in the light is just awesome. I&#x27;m glad that i was able to get this color. I wasn&#x27;t able to find it except on this site.</li>
    <li> At some angles a glittery pink, other angles a shade of orange. Fun color for something different to add to your pallet of colors.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice color. It has pink, red, and orange tones and changes depending on the lighting.  Also, thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Bought this specific OPI nail polish, used it once, went back a couple months later and half of it had evaporated and the rest was hard as a rock.  I don&#x27;t know how this was stored before they shipped it, but I have never had this happen to an OPI before.</li>
    <li> I love this color.  And I received it very fast!  I believe this color is discontinued, too.  Nice to know you can still get it.  It&#x27;s probably one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> We got are nails done in this color and loved it so much bought as many ad we could. If you get it and wear it you also,will want to buy this color</li>
    <li> OPI: The show must go on is a lovely sparkly color. It&#x27;s like a burnt reddish orange color. It took 3 coats for it to be full coverage for me but is well work it! You can definitively layer this polish over any red,orange or even black! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have many uses for this lovely color. Thanks again for your speedy shipping and it came in great condition as usual. I have purchased many polishes from this seller and I am always satisfied with my order. Top Notch Seller!</li>
    <li> My fav discontinued color, was glad I could find it</li>
    <li> came as described, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I just received a message that these have been delivered. I can&#x27;t wait to use this polish again! It has been my favorite for several years and always gets compliments. So sad they don&#x27;t continue to produce it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I looked and looked for this color.  A friend was wearing it and I saw it and just had to have it!  It is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I had looked everywhere for this color and couldn&#x27;t find it so I was thrilled to find it on this site.  I purchased 4 bottles and wonder if I should have purchase more.  I don&#x27;t think OPI makes it any longer.</li>
    <li> I was happy to be able to order this product but I found that the color was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; a little.  It is more of a solid red/pink whereas the product I used previously had tinges of other colors that this didn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> I really like the color but I feel like I need more than two coats to really get the desired effect. I would recommend this to a friend as I do love the color!</li>
    <li> Of all the polishes I have ever used, I love this one best.  It is JUST PERFECT in every way.  It goes on smooth and the color is delightful.  Sometimes, it looks ORANGE, sometimes it is PURPLE sometimes it is PINK and it is always varied according to what you are wearing and the suns reflection.  I jusst love it.</li>
