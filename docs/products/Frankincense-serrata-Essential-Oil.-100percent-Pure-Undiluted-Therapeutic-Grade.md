<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used several of Plant Therapy&#x27;s EOs, including Frankincense, Sleep Aid and Immunition, and am very pleased with the quality.  I will choose this brand over a couple of the more expensive, and the quality is just as high as those other brands.  Thank you, Plant Therapy, for offering a high standard in Essential Oils.</li>
    <li> Amazingly it did reduce size of my ganglion cyst</li>
    <li> Great oil for my son and for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love love love ; I have read that it was great for skin among many other things so I decided to add it to my skin care regimen. Honestly I really didn&#x27;t expect much change but after three days of using frankicense under my eyes, I noticed my fine lines disappeared ... Wow! Now I am working with my lines around my mouth and hope to have the same change.</li>
    <li> Great product! Thank you</li>
    <li> I received the Frankincense essential oil in a timely manner and am very pleased with the product. I am not an expert in essential oils, but I am told it is good for encouraging cell growth in skin care.  I used it in an anti-aging skin serum and it seems to work beautifully.  I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I love the oil and the price. I use it as one of the ingredients in a rub I make. I have just used it to remove a wart from the top of my hand. I was not thrilled with the idea of going to the dermatologist to have it frozen and then have a big red spot and scar for months. I applied frankincense oil twice daily - full strength. In my case it took probably 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> It is 100% some kind of oil but Frankincense is not part of the mix. How do you sell something like this with a clear canscience.??</li>
    <li> This EO is a keeper. I use it on my face, and in my face wash. It has a pleasant woodsy smell.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE for Gold!!  Mix with Jojoba Oil for a fantastic after bath skin thirst quencher.  Works much better than lotions.</li>
    <li> not quite as strong as doTerra</li>
    <li> Did not like the fragrance ... just not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> I feel it is not the same product I had purchased before even though it is the same company. Not sure if they made changes to it or what but even the smell is different.</li>
    <li> Using this in my horse&#x27;s wounds. Working wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I use it as anointing oil</li>
    <li> Second bottle ordered.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> I have back problems and the inflammation in my back was causing my disks to bulge.&lt;br /&gt;They wanted to do surgery.  I am not into surgery and started several alternative therapies. I don&#x27;t know if&lt;br /&gt;this would work alone or not, but once I added this with Acupuncture and Heated Massage therapy the tide was&lt;br /&gt;turned!  I use this every day, about 3 drops does my entire back.  Since using it, I now only go to the acupuncture every 4-6 weeks&lt;br /&gt;instead of 2x a week!  This is huge.  And I have not needed a heated massage in 5 months now.  My latest x ray shows the inflammation is not gone, but reduced to the point it is not bulging my disks anymore!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use for vertigo relief after having it recommended to me. It worked! Vertigo has been gone for a couple of weeks now. Great essential oil.</li>
    <li> Good oil but could be more pure.</li>
    <li> I am not going to say who I am or what I do because it doesn&#x27;t matter. I see reviews on here complaining about this frankincense and they are quite absurd. 1. GOOD LUCK getting a high grade pure essential oil such as frankincense at this price. 2. IT ACTUALLY is very good. 3. YOUNG LIVING- is not pure do some research, they were once considered \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; until you start researching I have news for you, biodynamically grown essential oils such as JURLIQUE cannot be beat. I am not here to argue but to stand up for this lovely frankincense. YOUNG LIVING charges much more and JURLIQUE which is the highest grade known to any afficionado is triple this price.&lt;br /&gt;If you are so sophisticated you would not purchase a frankincense for 11.00 and complain. I think it is rather disrespectful to the company the earth and the people who are reading the reviews. I personally feel the oil was quite excellent. It smells like frankincense so whoever said it didn&#x27;t may not have the best nose. It  did what I wanted and I will buy it all the time. In fact I think it is high quality. It is none of my business what anyone on here is using it for because oils are to be respected and I would never even reveal my usage because unless you understand them you must be very cautious. I loved the peppermint as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased and think that it is a tremendously excellent price, I mean young living is much better? then order it. That to me is a useless review. It is essential oil and unless you are all aromatherapists and holistic practitioners you should not be using it without respect. If you really knew about essential oils you would appreciate the quality and the affordability of this brand. I hope no one criticizes you the way you did this. I am just tired of reviews that are not truly relative and think AMAZON should take down anything not related to the products actual efficiacy as what it is being sold for. I won&#x27;t sell on here for this very reason. It is indeed an excellent oil, I highly recommend it and am just tired of silly reviews. It is a great oil for only 11.00oil, I highly recommend it and am just tired of silly reviews. It is a great oil for only 11.00</li>
    <li> Love Plant therapy oils!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say overall that this seemed to be a really good essential oil, especially for the price.  Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> I got this to help with my asthma.  It&#x27;s helped so much.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent.  Woodsy with a hint of lemon, pine and anise.  Not very strong, but very lovely.  Arrived very fast....to Hawaii even.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality of oil.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other oils of frankenscense and they were stronger and last longer. this was very light odor and just after using it I could no longer catch the scent. Customer service is good, got the product in time is why it was given 3 stars but the product is weak.</li>
    <li> I do not recall if the product description indicated whether this was Boswellia serrata or canteri.  Another product I use of frankincense - is canteri and I assumed this was what I had purchased from Plant Therapy.  The &#x27;Serrata&#x27; aroma was different - stronger that I was accustomed to with the canteri , yet - it is gone now and I need to get some more.  I like Plant Therapy products - prices are good.  Frankincense can be very expensive (and worth it)This was a good choice.</li>
    <li> Thanks plant therapy and Amazon. Great price on an expensive EO. Frankincense is a must keep in our house and I love the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. Remember you always get what you pay for. I ordered this to compare it to other essential oil companies that are more expensive. This stuff smells like burnt hydrolic fluid. Avoid it at all cost.</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say that I was very disapointed in the quality and smell of this oil that I purchased. I was not happy with this product.  Fortunately the company refunded my full purchase price and i think that was wonderful.  thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product and seems to work just as well as Young Living essential oils!</li>
    <li> Frankincense is one of those &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; oils that is good for so many things and am always please with Plant Therapy oils.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Why? Well this oil is useful for many things and if you know a little about essential oils you know this, if not- it is a wise thing to learn about. Starting at literally the top the oil is actually labeled on the lid so that you can find it with other oils that you may have, quickly and easily. Some criticize this for the aroma but the oil is consistent with other Frankincense I have smelled so that&#x27;s not an issue for me. A very useful oil at a great price. Folks with more knowledge than I have told me that  Plant therapy oils are good, pure oils and I trust that. Given the great price and the purity I call this a great buy. Stay well and God Bless ya!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had chronic neck pain for the past 3 years and have tried everything. Anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids help a bit but not fully. And when my neck is in serious pain, theres an area where it swells like the size of a big marble. I heard of essential oils and their uses. So I did some research and decided to buy Frankincense and Lavender essential oils. I just wantd to try something different and hoped for the best. I thought - it cant hurt, especially after taking ibuprophen,etc for so long now! When i received it, I diluted 2 drops along with 2 drops of lavender in 40 drops of almond oil, and at bed time i applied to inflamed &amp; painful neck area. The next morning I woke up and realized my pain was gone, and when I touched my neck I could not believe that the swollen marble was gone! I mean gone, flat, not a hint of it! I thought that it was going to reduced slowly as I would apply it everyday. But it happened overnight. I was truly amazed! I&#x27;ve also used it for cold symptoms. And now I keep my medicine cabinet stocked with Frankincense oil.</li>
    <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s called Frankincense but it isn&#x27;t. Having grownup in with the Catholic faith, I&#x27;m quite aware the scent of frankincense and this product was not it. I had a couple other people smell it too just to be sure my nose wasn&#x27;t off-whack. All persons said they could not identify the scent, but when I told them it was frankincense, they were like, &amp;#34;No! Frankincese smells like...&amp;#34; One of the people whom I brought the oil too was a doTerra retailer and she informed me that you get what you pay for, the more highly refined/clarified frankincense should be upwards of $70.00; the resin from the boswallia &amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; tree is not that easy to acquire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regrettably, Amazon does not offer returns on it b/c it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;hazardous substance.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is truly therapeutic oil...  It just didn&#x27;t have the right fragrance, that I am used to.  It also did not work for me as well as the brands I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> perfect,excellent price came in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> I like that oil very much! I have muscle pain very often.That oil help me. I use it and my pain is gone.</li>
    <li> I have tried many this brand is above most</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an essential oil that smells like High Church Olibanum incense, look elsewhere, this isn&#x27;t it.   This is Boswellia Serrata and it doesn&#x27;t exhibit the \\&quot;true\\&quot; frankincense odor, in fact it resembles oil of Elemi more than anything, pungently citrus with very few balsamic notes to speak of. The \\&quot;real\\&quot; Frankincense odor is something quite different, basically spicy, balsamic and woody with only a slight citrusy tang at the end of it.  Needless to say it&#x27;s derived from the rarer and therefore more costly genus Oman Frankincense or Boswellia Sacra.  So don&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very nice, sent delicate &amp; subtle&lt;br /&gt;Got bruised on my back, that was black &amp; blue&lt;br /&gt;Had a hard time falling a sleep, it was quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;Mixed 5 drops in 15 ml of coconut oil &amp; rubbed it on my bruised, then the rest of my back.&lt;br /&gt;Worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> I was specifically looking for \\&quot;boswellia frereana\\&quot;, which is what this product is listed as being.  However, I received a different species (Boswellia serrata).  I do love the smell - it&#x27;s like cedar, or something woodsy, I think, but I was disappointed to have a different species, after I had read this:  \\&quot;There are several species of Frankincense that are grown in different parts of the Middle East. The carterii or frereana species have documented healing properties.\\&quot; on this website: [...]  But, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still a good product, although not what&#x27;s listed, and I will use it.  When it&#x27;s time to reorder, I&#x27;ll just look around for another source of the species I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like frankincense, smells like a disenfective.</li>
    <li> The oil is a very nice quality with a lovely and true fragrance.  Product arrived quickly and was a good price.</li>
    <li> Frankincense oil is very beneficial to me I like it because of it&#x27;s healing properties like&lt;br /&gt;  Strengthen gums and hair roots&lt;br /&gt;  Stop wounds from bleeding&lt;br /&gt;  Speed up the healing of cuts, acne, insect bites, and as well boils. I will continue to purchase this oil for many year&#x27;s to come.</li>
    <li> Extremely delightful!!! In fact, I could use more!</li>
    <li> I love the whole line of essential oils by this company. They make pure clean oils totally affordable. I totally endorse them. This oil is probably the number one oil everyone should have in their pantry! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the quality of these oils. I&#x27;ve purchased several from Plant Therapy &amp; have always been satisfied. I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the reviews that this is a miracle oil. So, I tried it for myself. I have found that when nothing else works, this works... it is good for acne, it is good for pain (and you can apply it to your face without worrying about any vapors that will sting your eyes)</li>
    <li> I like frankincense and this is a very nice product of it. I am happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Really like this frankincense. I love how it feels on my face and how rejuvenated I look in the morning from using it the night before.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for cold sores - it works instantly especially if you catch it in the beginning.  It works better than anything on the market. I use it and my friend uses it.  I found out purely by accident. I had a cold sore and I had nothing to put on it - I dabbed a little on a cotton ball and it worked.  I have been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> Love using Frankincense for arthritis inflammation so I thought I would try this one. The price was great.&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is awful! I&#x27;ve only tried it a couple of times because I can not stand to smell this one. So I couldnt even say if it works as well as the other one i used.&lt;br /&gt;Im going back to the other, costs more, but in my opinion well worth it to actually be able to use it and get the benefits!</li>
    <li> This smells right, and it&#x27;s the best price I found for this oil. I&#x27;m happy with the quality. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m continually amazed at the effectiveness of this oil. Wow! Great for inflammation. ..</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly with no damage.  Have never used this before, so there is no way for comparison on quality or value.</li>
    <li> This oil has a great scent and seems to work well. I&#x27;ve used it for skin irritations on my daughter as well as just diffusing it in the house.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic to get it,after reading other reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I did. It smells and feels like it should, great essential oil.</li>
    <li> I DO love Plant Therapy Oils and have ordered a number of their oils so far... But this Frankincense Essential Oil came as a bad surprise to me. It seems to be very diluted and it is almost smell-free... I ordered the same oil from Plant Therapy a couple of years ago, and that one was just a great frankincense essential oil, so I was expecting to get the same good quality product. Unfortunately have to return...</li>
    <li> This is what they brought to our Lord Jesus as a gift when He was first born - gifts fit for a king. It has many healing benefits. My mom had gotten a lot of bed sores on her rear end from lying down suffering with cancer I washed them with a therapeutic Tea Tree soap (purchased from Amazon.com), and mixed this oil with almond oil, coconut oil, and Bhringraj oil. I rubbed it all over her sores (she had at least 30). The next day when she was being cleansed at Hospice, they noticed a difference; the sores had started healing. I saw it with my own two eyes - they looked totally different and better. Try it for yourself, I am sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this by saying that I own about 15-20 oils and blends from this company that I use for many different things and none of them have failed me yet. Until now. I had heard many good things about frankincense so I started looking into it.&lt;br /&gt;The Sprouts in my neighborhood sells essential oils so I smelled their frankincense and really liked it. It was earthy and warm and almost had a vanilla scent to it. I thought I&#x27;d be clever and save $20+ by ordering from plant therapy.&lt;br /&gt; Nope. This oil is super watered down - it literally pours out. It should be thick and sticky like patchouli. It also smelled nothing like what I smelled at the store. This one actually has kind of a fecal odor to it. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;It does mix well in the diffusor with other oils so I won&#x27;t return it, but I would advise you not to waste your money. I&#x27;m not saying spend a fortune on doTerra or YoungLiving Frankincense but I wish I had just went ahead and spent the $30 on whatever brand Spouts has.</li>
    <li> This oil, mixed with the essential oil, Myrrh, is a natural pain reliever.  Amazing how soooo many years ago at Jesus&#x27; birth, this was one of the gifts that The Wise Men brought Jesus.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Use it a lot. Helps every time</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle from this company and my first bottle of Frankincense, but I do love it and have recommended it to a family member.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to EO and I love the facet that you can buy a quality product without added costs for overhead. I have used tea tree oil for years and carry it when I backpack and travel. I have been having the best time learing about EO and being able to afford to purchace them through Plant Therapy. I use topical, toothpaste, deodorant, cleaning, face creams. The frankincense has good reviews for wrinkles so only time will tell.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our lotion for all of its healing properities. We love our lotion so I&#x27;d say it is a success.</li>
    <li> Frankincense is becoming my second favorite after cinnamon.  This frankincense did not disappoint.  Very nice aroma, and I will be using it topically to see if it helps with my arthritic knee.  Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Where my homies at--gold and myrrh?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways....sorry. This smells amazing! First time purchase... first time smelling Frankincense. I haven&#x27;t explored using it in any recipes (for natural beauty or cleaning products) but I can&#x27;t wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From diffusing them together, I&#x27;m pretty sure Frankincense and Lavender are the key to all perfumes. Hmmm.. DIY perfume anyone?? (YES, MEEEEEEE!!!)</li>
    <li> I read about a small study that showed that frankincense helped with anxiety and depression.  I&#x27;m game.  The smell is interesting and refreshing.</li>
    <li> We got this for a Sunday school demonstration, everybody wanted to know what myrhh and frankinsense smelled like.  The pictures are available on line, but they don&#x27;t give one any idea of the scents.  I&#x27;m glad things like this are available through Amazon as they&#x27;re not the sorts of items that can be found locally in small towns.</li>
    <li> I used this for a lesion I found and rubbed it on morning and night and was gone in 2 weeks.  (always check with dermatologist on skin lesions)  I also use it at night, rub a little on my neck and it helps me to relax and makes me a little sleepy.</li>
    <li> This product is very popular in the Bible.  It&#x27;s a great fragrance, but also very therapeutic.  We use it for many purposes an love it!</li>
    <li> did a lot of research from other companies and my husband did not want to do a multi-level company. This has worked great. thank you!</li>
    <li> Probably why the frankincense was so affordable, not a very rich or convincing odor from my diffusers while using the oil.  Was expecting more as I have used this one before but from a different company.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was prompt and packing good as well.  Could have been happier as this oil offers very high vibrations normally but in this case seemed deflated and a rather chemical type smell.  Not pleasant at all..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottles had names printed atop lid which is a nice touch as you can determine which is which from above.</li>
    <li> I used it on a cyst on my finger for a few days, cyst almost gone, awesome product would buy again !!!!</li>
    <li> This product is for EXTERNAL use only (or at least the bottle states this). So if you are searching for an ingestible frankincense, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for you. Otherwise, it has noticeably reduced my allergy symptoms and reduced the appearance of a dark spot that I have on my face.</li>
    <li> It does the job but it doesn&#x27;t smell like true Frankincense.  I prefer the DoTerra Frankincense but it&#x27;s sooooo expensive via Doterra.  This is a good Frankincense if you&#x27;re mixing with other oils that can assist the frangrance.</li>
    <li> Product is significantly helping with my eyesight along with Sweet fennel, Carrot Seed Oil, and Saffron Oil. Both the cataracts and the nearsightedness improve when I use it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really have the aroma that I thought it would.. But ok</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I needed for my EO first-aid kit. Thanks for being so quick and my favorite essential oils supplier :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this oil.  I&#x27;ve purchased several different oils  from Plant Therapy over the years.  They are always dependable.  I&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this oil &amp; the company.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Love this.  It did ease and help rid me of upper back pain.  Smells good.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helping my skin and has a good smell. It&#x27;s doing what I wanted it to do, which is help clear up acne probs.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent! It has an earthy smell, and seems potent, grounding, and uplifting simultaneously. Thank you for this awesome creation!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for affordable essential oil and i am so happy I found this on Amazon! Great product that has been perfect for our family</li>
    <li> I love this product and would tell others about it...it is more than I expected and will last for a long time...well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love love Plant Therapy oils! I trust this company! Great price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel anything..... like all other reviewers said. Wish I did. I like the price you know..</li>
    <li> This product was better than I expected truly 100 percent like they said its so strong</li>
    <li> Great oil with an exceptional price!</li>
    <li> I have smelled Frankincense from YL and other EO manufacturers and they smelled sweet. This one is not sweet and has a &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; smell to it. I&#x27;m assuming it will still have most of the benefits of Frankincense (I hope), so, I&#x27;m going to keep it to use in my 11 year old son&#x27;s homemade deodorant. I will not be putting it in my face lotion though, which is one reason I wanted it. Frankincense is supposed to be helpful for wrinkles. I will buy at least one of the other Plant therapy blends again that I&#x27;ve used, but I will absolutely not be buying this EO from them again.</li>
    <li> We love the scent of this oil. I mix a few drops into castor oil I pour into the palm of my hand and use the combo to massage into achy muscles. I have seen this ease pain very quickly and reliably.</li>
    <li> I mix my own moisturizer from several different essential oils.  Frankincense is one of the main ingredients I use, and I always buy from Plant Therapy Essential Oils because I know they&#x27;re pure.  I&#x27;ve ordered from other companies, but when I get the product, I find that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;blends.&amp;#34;  With Plant Therapy Essential Oils, I know I&#x27;m getting ONLY the oil I want and need for my moisturizer.  The company is also quick to fill orders, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> it is very watery so when you shake to get drop, several come out.  The smell is pretty bad.  I used it with faith, thinking maybe the smell was necessary to know it is working.  Have  not had MRI so don&#x27;t know results but not truly convinced about this product.</li>
    <li> The quality of the Frankincense oil is very good and has a beautiful aroma. I had an issue with the dropper, and contacted the seller. They were very prompt and solved my issue immediately - I was more than satisfied! 10 stars for their customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more from this seller!</li>
    <li> It does not smell like the oil my friend has but then again hers is a different brand.</li>
    <li> Living in the South, with fire ants, I purchased this to see if it was true that it is great for stings and bites. Since it&#x27;s arrived I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it, because I haven&#x27;t received any bites, which is wonderful. I&#x27;m hoping it works, because my luck will eventually run out. The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant, as some people seem to find. It&#x27;s unusual, a little like camphor or turpentine, but not at all bad. If it works for bites and stings, I don&#x27;t really care how it smells.</li>
    <li> Continuing to enjoy this oil. I use it on my knees and heel of my foot and I can feel the improvement. It also is helping with my psoriasis so I will start using the oil on my skin to see if the improvements continue. Love the quick delivery I receive, usually next day delivery. Very efficient since I sometimes can&#x27;t tell when I&#x27;m near the bottom of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil, it was great for my meditaion and really relaxed me.  I like it before bed too.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with frankincense but I think the quality of this oil is pretty decent, though it is really watery and the smell could last a bit longer and be a bit stronger.  for the price though, it&#x27;s definitley worth it.</li>
    <li> While Plant Therapy has excellent customer service and a 100% money back guarantee which I appreciate, I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. As a disclaimer, I have a basis for comparison as I&#x27;m used to Young Living oils; but wanted to see if cheaper alternatives were the same quality. As far as this oil goes, I don&#x27;t feel it is. It has the consistency of water, and once placed in my diffuser (8 drops) I could hardly smell it. Those used to YL Frankincense know this isn&#x27;t right as it is normally a very potent oil. Yes, it is cheaper but you truly get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT oil.  Very pure and effective, AND I would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality oil. It has a very pleasing smell. It provides a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere.</li>
    <li> I was told to mix this with your face creams to make you look younger and more youthful. Since using I have had people ask what I do to keep my face looking so young..LOL</li>
    <li> love the sent this was used in the olden days to prepare Christ body and given as a gift at birth</li>
    <li> I am slowly cutting my antidepressant to lower dosages on my own and hope to one day not have to take it at all.  I had been taking 75 mg.daily of Venlafaxine (Effexor).  I now am successfully taking only 37.5 mg. daily.  I inhale directly from the bottle the aroma of this Frankincense.  I feel immediate relaxation, focus and happiness.  And I also am sleeping a lot better at night.  One day (several months from now) I hope to NOT at all have to take the Venlafaxine.  This is a marvelous product.  It is pure and has no additives....only Frankincense!</li>
    <li> Smells nothing like any Frankincense I&#x27;ve ever smells.  Other Plant Therapy Essential Oils (Cedarwood &amp; Patchouli) were bad also.</li>
    <li> delivered quickly  works fine  thank you</li>
    <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;www.KeyAesthetics.com</li>
    <li> Great product. There&#x27;s so many uses for this oil and I love it. Thank you for having it at such a great price!</li>
    <li> I rub this on my fee every night.  It smells great and seems to be great quality.  And the price is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I read that frankensense had many good properties and is from biblical times. It&#x27;s ok, but I bet there are others like maybe myrrh that I would like better. The one I ordered May cure cancer though.</li>
    <li> Frankincense has a pleasant smell. Not overpowering at all. For all the benefits it provides beauty wise, I look forward to using it in my face oil and body scrub concoctions!</li>
    <li> The price is very affordable compared to some brands, but the aroma has a kind of petroleum smell as compared to the expensive one I purchased before.  I cannot yet speak to its effectiveness in reducing inflammation, which is what I use it for.</li>
    <li> I bought this E.O. for making some beard oil for a friend and because the price was reasonable.  When I received the product, it was great!  It smelled the way it was suppose to and blended perfectly.  I will probably order more products from Plant Therapy!</li>
    <li> Great product, seems pricey but it&#x27;s not when you realize you only need 1 or 2 drops - so it will last a long time. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, people were saying how great Plant Therapy brand was so I bought about 10 different bottles. After using Young Living I decided to see if this measured up. First of all the smell is disgusting. Doesn&#x27;t smell remotely like frankincense at ALL. I figured I would see how it did in the diffuser, since I didn&#x27;t want to put in on me. I put in maybe 8-10 drops. Sat and watched in disbelief as it evaporated in less than 10 seconds. Must be pure rubbing alcohol. I&#x27;m hoping Amazon will let me return the unopened bottles so I can just buy the good stuff. Not sure how this company stays in business, because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any oil in this &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; at all.</li>
    <li> Great woodsy scent. I&#x27;ve been using it through a steam diffuser and diluted in almond oil on my chest for a cough and it has done wonders!    *Update:  I have since tried a more expensive brand (Doterra), and greatly prefer this to the other more expensive brand.  The other more expensive brand was sickly sweet in smell. Like, sweet to the point of nausea.  Plant Therapy brand blended well with other oils, unlike the more expensive brand.  I went back to Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy Frankincense essential oil smells fresh and earthy.. I am currently using it mixed with jojoba oil for my thyroid and hoping it will help.  Great product and value :)</li>
    <li> Great to use as an astringent on ingrown hair. I have very sensitive skin so have to use something like this that won&#x27;t be too harsh.</li>
    <li> I had received a bottle of Frankincense to try from another large name in EO and this didn&#x27;t have the same smell nor work as well if it worked at all.  The smell that comes from what I received from PTE is more like a tree bark therefore I can&#x27;t use it.  It was worth the try but I will go back to the other company and spend a little more money to get what I need.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference between this product and a more expensive MLM brand, except for the price of coarse.  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying the Frankincense oil very much. I&#x27;ve used some in my facial moisturizer and have added a few drops to the bath - seems wonderfully calming and soothing.</li>
    <li> Pleased with price and quality.  I have not had other brands of Frankincense, so I cannot compare. That is why I would not give a 5 star.  Seems to help with pain.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with the quality of this essential oil. I use it neat (alternating with lavender and a citrus oil) for actinic keratosis. I also use it in a blend along with lavender and rose geranium and grapeseed oil as a carrier for peripheral neuropathy. I am having an exceptionally positive response in both cases. I will definitely continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> smells fabulous.  Just starting to dabble with essential oils and not ready to spend big money on the top 2 &amp;#34;pyramid&amp;#34; brands. so far very happy with Plant Therapy products.</li>
    <li> Does not diffuse well. May not be 100% EO.</li>
    <li> First time user of frankincense oil, the quality of this seems good to me. I have found it helps relieve muscle pain when applied topically and rubbed in (use it on my neck and shoulders), and the aromatherapy is relaxing and mentally clarifying. Plan to buy again!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I throw some in the diffuser when someone is sick, and by the next day they feel so much better, helps with aches and pains as well. its amazing</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase of the Frankincense Oil. The quality is good and I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the benefits of essential oils, but after gaining wonderful benefits from this frankincense oil, I am very interested in discovering how to use other oils for better health and well being. This was a truly blessed purchase!</li>
    <li> I have not used the frankincense oil, yet.  I have purchased other Plant Therapy EOs &amp; have never been disappointed &amp; don&#x27;t expect to be this time.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT EVEN REMOTELY SMELL LIKE FRANKINCENSE</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week. I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in blood pressure.</li>
    <li> perfect for making my natural remedy for UTI</li>
    <li> Nothing like the real thing</li>
    <li> I got this specifically to add to my headache blend.  I have tried many over the counter medications for my headaches, but nothing seems to work.  So, I decided to try EOs.  I use Peppermint, Lavendar, and Frankencense in a carrier oil as my headache blend, and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  When I told my husband, he said, &amp;#34;That must work great, because NOTHING knocks your headaches out!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> great strong smell, mixes well with other oils.  Low cost but high quality oils!  I did my research, and I think this is an ethical company that makes good stuff.</li>
    <li> Its essential oil and it smells good</li>
    <li> i would be helpful if some information was sent with the product on how to use the product and uses for the product&lt;br /&gt;just an out line nothing extensive just to get a person introduced to your products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Ken</li>
    <li> LOVE frankincense....one of our favorite oils! Love the smell but more than that, the healing! Works great with copaiba, balsam fir, and helichrysum for a morphine bomb to get rid of pain! Really works, even on our dogs!</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be 100% pure but was watered down. Used whole bottle in atomizer in 2 hours.  I Had to buy a better&lt;br /&gt;product at health food store. Cost twice as much but lasted much longer</li>
    <li> I really love this Frankincense oil; I  use in my diffuser quite frequently with some other oils and it really is calming and relaxing.  I also use it in my nail oil and it&#x27;s also included in my daytime facial oil and nighttime facial oil.  It&#x27;s very versatile and because it&#x27;s an essential oil, it certainly can&#x27;t do you any harm.  You just have to use plain, common sense.  I would recommend this oil as a staple in any essential oil collection.</li>
    <li> Love it! Has so many uses</li>
    <li> Good price and quality</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research and thought I&#x27;d try this on my granuloma annulare (since doctors don&#x27;t have a clue when it comes to GA).  I applied it directly to the affected areas and was hoping for the best.  About three minutes later my husband looked at me with a disgusted look on his face and asked what that smell was.  I don&#x27;t know how anyone can say that this has a pleasant aroma.....it smells like cat pee.  I had to go wash it off with soap and water.  A few hours later I decided to try applying it to just one small spot instead of all affected areas, but hot the same result.  Just one small drop stunk up the whole room.  I don&#x27;t know if it just this brand or if all frankincense oil smells this badly.  I am sorely disappointed as I had high hopes for this being able to treat my GA.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> one of my favorites!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the aroma.  Would highly reccommend.</li>
    <li> It smells delicious. I am very happy with my purchase. I was so nervous about ordering online. Everyone is so into doterra and young living, since this was cheaper I took a shot. I am so happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This oil may be useful for any of the number of ailments mentioned in other reviews. But if you are looking for a nice scent look elsewhere. I know that pure Boswellia carteri costs a lot more than this product but I was hoping for a scent in the same ballpark at least. Smells like a compost heap. Do not get this expecting to scent your home for the Holidays!</li>
    <li> My wife and I like to burn incense when we pray but sometimes I&#x27;m just too lazy to fire up the charcoal. Just a few drops on a piece of cloth or tissue emits a pleasing aroma for an hour or so, although it smells quite different from frankincense incense. Not as subtle. Still, a fine lazy-man&#x27;s substitute.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time . I haven&#x27;t been using it consecutively not sure of the results yet ill get back to you in a month . The smell is awful though .</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it everyday. Thanks for the great product and service.</li>
    <li> It has a sudden urine gently smell. ...I wished they would had added a little more plant such as basil : )</li>
    <li> This was my first straight frankincense (previously only experienced it as part of a blend) and at first it was a bit intense, but now that I have gotten used to it, I really crave it and won&#x27;t be without it.  Therapeutically I use it twice daily on a small skin bump on my arm that looks a little bit like a tag although I&#x27;m not exactly sure what it is, anyway it took a while but I have noticed that it is shrinking.</li>
    <li> This oil, along with some lavender oil, and epsom salt in a foot bath.....very soothing and relaxing. Or you could just go on complaining.......</li>
    <li> They say if the frankincense oil has any color to it, then it is not pure; that being said, this oil has NO color to it.  It is almost a clear--with a hint of shiny silver.  It smells earthy and relaxing.  I bought one for a family member as frankincense is said to help destroy cancer cells.  He puts 1-2 drops under his tongue everyday twice a day.  You can also put this in a diffuser next to your bed which will help kill cancer cells and relax you at the same time.  I bought this bottle as well for myself for my yoga exercise and it also helps with Red stretch marks!  It really works, but you must be consistent and apply twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil seems pretty pure, and I will be purchasing again from them!</li>
    <li> I really love plant therapys oils. There all great quality, and i love the woodsy scent of this one. I make my own facial oil with this, and also use it for a laundry scent. It fills my hallway with the scent of the woods.. hehe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great all purpose oil, i&#x27;d re purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had been using a different brand of this oil, but decided to try something new....I am very pleased!  This brand seems to work much better than what I was previously using.  Glad I decided to try something new.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality and price of this oil.</li>
    <li> Just received my frankincense oil...have not had long but noticing a difference in rubbing it on my arthritic knee pain...will continue to use</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product quality and price.  I use this oil daily.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I teach yoga and used a lot of natural oils. This line smells great, lasts, and is a great price. Arrived quickly too. They answer your questions which is nice as well.</li>
    <li> I used up one bottle in 2 weeks-few drops a day two times a day.&lt;br /&gt;Normally other brands can last for more than the 2 week duration.</li>
    <li> This frankincense smells absolutely AWFUL!! I have smelled this essential oil before and it was woodsy, musky, and pleasant. This was just gross.</li>
    <li> Very concentrated, smell is rather strong, but it is an essential oil after all. Tried many others this is the one!</li>
    <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s pure grade oil, but the bottle dropper is unable to dispense a drop at a time. To get any oil out, you must turn it completely upside down. Once you do that, about 6-8 drops come out very fast. I was hoping I could add 1-3 drops of this oil to a carrier oil but it&#x27;s impossible to do that. I thought perhaps the bottle dropper was faulty so I took a dropper top from a different bottle and installed it on the Frankincense bottle. The same thing happened. The problem is that the oil has the same consistency of water and it&#x27;s just impossible to get a drop out at a time. I guess I&#x27;ll just remove the bottle dropper and use an eye dropper. Does anyone know if all Frankincense oils are this thin and watery?</li>
    <li> I like to take some time before writing a review on anything here on Amazon. This is my second bottle from this company and I couldn&#x27;t be happier for the price. That said, sure \\&quot;Young Living\\&quot; may be more concentrated. I wouldn&#x27;t say much though and I actually prefer the dilution (Yes they are pretty much all diluted even if it says pure, pure is like a tar oil, super thick and very potent. This is much safer and still strong enough to be effective. Only real reason you&#x27;d want it fully undiluted is if you were going to burn it and in that case just buy the resin) rate used by Plant Therapy. I use it for many things and don&#x27;t like to give medical advice but if your looking for the \\&quot;Serrata\\&quot; version of Frankincense I&#x27;d highly recommend you give this one a try before wasting your money on the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I also recommend a few other Plant Therapy oils. Just so happy with the quality I think they deserve a little praise! Keep it up and I&#x27;ll be a customer for life!!</li>
    <li> What an amazing oil.  This is a essential oil that is an all around oil.  Healing, spiritual, and comforting...thank you</li>
    <li> Does not smell nearly as nice as the Now brand frankincense oil. This one is all pine smell, without the complex spicy and unusual notes you expect from frankincense. The pine scent is nice, though. It&#x27;s not awful.</li>
    <li> I am just learning about the uses of essential oils and did not want to spend a lot of money. As it turns out, I got a very good quality product for a very good price.  I will continue to order from Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like I expected it to.  Seems high quality.</li>
    <li> Had a ganglion cyst and after 3 days this stuff got rid of it.  It&#x27;s been a few weeks and i think it&#x27;s slowly coming back but being that it only took 3 drops before I&#x27;m not too concerned.</li>
    <li> I have to read on this product also I don&#x27;t know how to use it .&lt;br /&gt;I just love the name.</li>
    <li> Had a spot on my arm would never heal quite perfect,  I put a drop on for a few days and what wouldn&#x27;t heal for months cleared right up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a bug &amp;#34;mosquito?&amp;#34;  bite that itches several days and literally one drop it never itches again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few oils without expected results but this did work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not heal poison ivy but helped a bit with itching.</li>
    <li> I love the soothing scent of Frankincense. This product is definitely a lot more potent than others I&#x27;ve purchased. Great service, great product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Smells good for the price. Someone from church let me use some of her frankincense EO on my broken toe, I don&#x27;t know If it helped, but I loved the smell, then she said It cost $90.00 a bottle  :o  well anyway, I thought I would try this more affordable oil. Needless to say It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the $90.00 :o  oil did, but it smells good for the price and came quickly. I recommend this company and like the other scents that I have bought from them as well. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a compliment to the 6 essential oil package.  I have already used some of it.  I mix esential oils with pure lanolin to make a healing and soothing salve.</li>
    <li> I love adding essential oils to my bath water. This is one of my favourites. I add just a few drops to a tub full. the aroma fills the air and it very soothing.</li>
    <li> First of all, I believe the other reviewers are correct that this *may not* be the species of Frankincense that you wanted, so read carefully. Also, unlike another review I found the scent to be very nice! I have the Young Living Frankincense and quite honestly, they seem very similar. (Just for comparison.)&lt;br /&gt;My cat has an osteosarcoma on her right shoulder area that has grown rather large and the prognosis for her is pretty terrible. So, I&#x27;ve added rubbing this oil into her tumor as part of a protocol that I started 2 weeks ago... including amygdalin (which you can buy in pill form here on Amazon), cat&#x27;s claw, and others. Perhaps enough time on the protocol had elapsed before introducing the Frankincense or perhaps the Frankincense pushed the envelope of care but the tumor has reduced significantly and \\&quot;changed\\&quot;... which is progress. (I&#x27;m trying to maintain her comfort and avoid surgery to take her WHOLE LEG and some ribs, etc. Her tumor was a semi-spherical mass, hard and dense.)&lt;br /&gt;The oil is a very \\&quot;thin\\&quot; viscosity, so it comes out of the dropper-styled bottle easily and you don&#x27;t get sticky or gooey. The oil spreads easily and absorbs quite well.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fantastic and super-fast. Excellent packaging. I give it 4/5 stars only because I am still investigating the species that they actually sent.</li>
    <li> as usual with this Oil- Great smelling!!</li>
    <li> If you like incense, essential oils and tinctures, this frankincense is some of the purest we&#x27;ve ever enjoyed. My girlfriend wanted it and she is a connoisseur of such things and she says it&#x27;s perfect, so therefore it is :) Although it isn&#x27;t the solid stuff that can be heated or burned, a few drops on a piece of aluminum foil heated atop a cigarette lighter fills the room with the purifying scent very nicely.</li>
    <li> Nice aroma - but it comes out very quickly - so I have to be careful. Much different consistency than some other oils that I&#x27;m use to - very &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; consistency.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to start using this in my daily face cream - as I&#x27;ve heard good things of what this can do for complexion.</li>
    <li> My dog had a growth on her ear  so I applied Frankincense for two days but only once a day by the third day the growth had dried up and fell off. My dogs ear looks great before that I was applying Neosporin but it wasn&#x27;t helping. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have never used Frankincense Oil before and I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I give this BRAND 4 Stars because it is NOT Gummy, as the UN Diluted Frankincense Oil I was used to using.&lt;br /&gt;I had bought an UN diuluted brand  that was costlier and was trying to save money buying this one.&lt;br /&gt;That brand had the sticky, gumminess to the oil it is supposed to have because Frankincense is&lt;br /&gt;produced from Boswellia,  a type of tree from the burseraceae family, which is noted for this fragrant sap.&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of it because I used it strait from the bottle and the drops are large and come out of the bottle too much &amp; fast,&lt;br /&gt;so I bought this one, which by the way, also comes out too much and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle says PURE but I am wondering if it is diluted instead ?  It is more liquid, and not at all gummy, or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Many of the companies get away with calling it PURE because there are no other ingredients in it other than whatever they use to dilute it.&lt;br /&gt;Water OR something eise. THEREFORE , it might not be a good brand for using as a stock bottle and adding drops to a carrier oil,&lt;br /&gt;but rather using it strait out of the bottle instead. This is a case of you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER it did do the Job! My dog had a Bloody Type Tumor on her hock called Cutaneous Histicytoma.&lt;br /&gt;It supposedly happens in young dogs. She is ONLY 2 years old. This type of Tumor is said to go away in time,&lt;br /&gt;but it can take months . She licked it constantly and it DEFINATELY seemed to be hurting her so I was not willing to wait&lt;br /&gt;for it to go away on its own, or pay for expensive surgery removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took her to the Vet  . $105 dollars later they prescribed a med that was supposed to help with the inflammation of the Tumor.&lt;br /&gt;She had this tumor for about 2 weeks prior to the Vet visit and it had grown during that time as I was thinking it was due to a trauma&lt;br /&gt;hitting her hock on something, like a hematoma. I was keeping it clean, expecting it to heal on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Medication from the vet for over a week and it did ZIPPO, NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;It was still Bleeding &amp; Growing. THEN I researched and found info on Frankincense Oil. I have used Essential Oils for&lt;br /&gt;alot of things but never a TUMOR ! I only applied it one or two times a day. In ONLY 5 days it was no longer a large round&lt;br /&gt;bleeding mass, It was a small, flat, less bleeding , scabby looking thing. I got this brand when I ran out of the expensive bottle,&lt;br /&gt; and it continued to shrink and disappear. I only wish I had taken a daiiy picture so others could see the FAST HEALING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This experience adds to my belief that Mother Nature has given the planet everything we need to live a happy and healthy life,&lt;br /&gt;and only MAN knows how to mess that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do have my dog on a mostly RAW diet also.</li>
    <li> This was strange smelling stuff.  I smelled other versions and this is nothing like it.</li>
    <li> Frankincense has been in use since Bible times for various maladies. You just have to do your own research to ind it&#x27;s usefulness.</li>
    <li> By itself it&#x27;s not all that appealing, but I combined it with myrrh and sweet orange essential oils and it sure does ease my mind. I feel great after having put a couple drops of each on my wrist and rubbed it in. There&#x27;s a slight tingle on each wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should try each of them individually. I&#x27;ll update when I&#x27;ve done that.</li>
    <li> I received the product promptly and I have made a mix with many different eos and the mix seems to be working!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents.  A lot of essential oils can smell harsh or not as you&#x27;d expect because they are so concentrated.  The Frankincense smells delightful.</li>
    <li> I probably got what I paid for. Not the real deal for sure.  Fragrance is closer to turpentine and gratefully doesn’t last long.</li>
    <li> I use it daily on my knee. It helps with joint pain.</li>
    <li> Frankincense Essential Oil was used to clear a sinus infection around the sides of my nose and nostrils.  I wanted to avoid antibiotics and the side effects and this oil cleared up the problem within a few days.  Highly recommend it to others with a similar problem.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks. I&#x27;m not sure how to rate it since I&#x27;ve never purchased frankincense oil before. I read that it helps clear up acne and acne scars, so I decided to try it out with my almond oil face concoction. We shall see</li>
    <li> Did not think it would smell the way it does - not the most pleasant essential oil smell.</li>
    <li> The seller was prompt with getting me the merchandise, but the product was the pits!  I normally use doTerra Frankincense all over my face every night and love the smell and benefits  the oil.  I wouldn&#x27;t put this stuff on my foot!  It smells gag worthy.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be AS good as doTerra.  It is after all a fraction of the cost...but this was a total wast of money, albeit not much money.  Perhaps some of Plant Therapy&#x27;s other oils are worth a try, but sear clear of the cheep Frankincense!</li>
    <li> I just love their oils! I love that they come with the label on the lids.</li>
    <li> Mixed with cocanut oil it is a great pain reliever</li>
    <li> 100% pure therapeutic grade is what I was looking for, high quality and contaminant free are important to me when I am putting it on my skin.</li>
    <li> It could be stronger and longer lasting though the smell is nice and earthy. Great for face I suppose since it is not too overwhelming.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this and uses it as part of her holistic medicine regime.  Must be something to it as she&#x27;s turning 50 this year and still get&#x27;s mistaken for one of my daughters.  Hmm...maybe it&#x27;s time for me to start using it!?!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to add to my growing essential oil collection in my pursuit to live a more holistic lifestyle and free myself from over the counter and prescription medications. Frankincense is one of the must have essential oils for anyone just starting out as it has many uses and benefits.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten into essential oils, studying voraciously about them and buying the ones I like. But the Frankencense was way out of my budget at $85. I have a history of skin cancers and had recently gotten sort of healed from one on my face with its resulting scar. I decided to get online and research if I needed the expensive frank or could I use the one from plant therapy at $12 with the same results. Good reputation, crazy good prices. I could afford to gamble $12 so I ordered some. I put it on my face 2-3x/day with a carrier oil and it took all of those pre-cancers away, plus an added benifit of taking away a lot of the fine lines my 58yr old skin had. It also made me feel good...sort of the &amp;#34;grins&amp;#34;. I guess that was the spiritual feel good it touts. I&#x27;ve now ordered several other plant therapy and now also Edens Garden oils with great results. And I can order all I want since the cost isnt crazy.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy is a great company to work with. Shipping is always prompt, and the products are WONDERFUL !</li>
    <li> Smells hauntingly good.  I see now why they used this stuff in the bible days so much.  It seems to be a good grade and has a myriad of health benefits.  I use it in my EO mixes and I also put it on my wrists neat.</li>
    <li> I mix it with distilled water and spray it on a blanket I cover myself with during my private prayer time.  It helps me think about God.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy Frankincense is equally as effective as the doTerra brand for a much more reasonable price!  Also, my order arrived in very timely fashion!  Plant Therapy will definitely be my source for essential oils from now on!</li>
    <li> I am just getting into essential oils.  I have multiple sites of pain.  I fine the Frankincense I to help a&lt;br /&gt;great deal in relieving this pain. Being one of the oils brought to the Baby Jesus,  I now realize the worth of it.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this oil a couple of times now. I use it as part of my facial skin care and believe I see results. I know frankincense has many beneficial uses and this from Plant Therapy is more affordable than others &amp; a good quality oil.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination, or maybe it&#x27;s actually working, but I feel like this oil added in to a mixture of other oils is really helping with the pain and inflammation caused by my rheumatoid arthritis.  I use it every night before bed and throughout the day and I feel like it really does help.</li>
    <li> GREAT value for a great price!! Lots of other multi level marketing companies charge so much more, but this is such a great value and an awesome essential oil for many purposes! Smell is exactly like what i got when I paid more for it. If you are new to oils, pick this one first! It has so many uses! And if you are thinking about Plant Therapy ... I can tell you they are great therapeutic oils, and the product ships from them quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this oil. Since breast cancer surgery, I use this along with coconut oil to check my breasts daily. The frankincense oil creates healing for me, and is very uplifting and comforting. It contains healing properties.</li>
    <li> I have all 3 frankincense from PT (serrata, carteri, and frereana) and love them all.  The serrata is great for achy joints; the carteri is what i put in my moisturizing oil; and the frereana is great for scars and wounds.  All are anti- inflammatory.  The quality of PT oils are great, and the customer service is outstanding!  If you aren&#x27;t happy about something, they make it right!  I buy from other companies as well, but for good quality at a reasonable price, and free shipping, PT is hard to beat!</li>
    <li> Frankincense is essential oil that is a must have for it&#x27;s multi-purposes. I use it on scrapes &amp; cuts: add a drop into hot water &amp; use it as a vapor for nasal congestion. This stuff is like having liquid gold. The price is fantastic and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Therapeutic Grade essential oil at its best.  Must be diluted before use because it is concentrated and a little goes a long way.  Delivery was fast and the bottle was well packaged and protected.</li>
    <li> Frankincense oil from Plant Therapy Essential Oils has a nice, not too strong aroma that helps to strengthen the immune system and is an ingredient in many essential oil sprays.</li>
    <li> You know what this oil is for or you wouldnt be looking here, what Im reviewing is this brand, Im happy with this bottle and packaging BECAUSE it doesnt come out too fast, there is some home party brand out there that will charge you twice to triple the price for the same thing, but the problem with their brand is the bottles and plastic stoppers, they are soooo big and loose that the oils POUR out, this is perfect, I can tape out a drop or two, or use a clean Qtip to get it out. We tend to use qtips. I really like this brand and how they package them and the plastic insert in the bottle so this doesnt spill everywhere and isnt too hard to get out.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, quality oil for the price. I use it mixed with lemon, lavender, and a carrier oil rubbed on my temples for headaches and to relieve stress. It have a great woody scent to it. I adore Plant Therapy Essential Oils &amp; will never stop raving about how great they are!!!</li>
    <li> VEry nice oil. It did not last very ling at all. But the smell is beautiful. I am going to try DoTErra because i heard good things like that it cures at cellular level for cancer.</li>
    <li> As a magical practitioner, I need pure essences for ritual, and this Plant Therapy Frankincense Oil does not disappoint. The color is very light, and the quality is very good. I find I get headaches from certain oils or incense and have to be very choosy. This oil does not at all give me a headache or any issue. It is calming, and of significant use in banishing negativity, of a high or low nature. Perfect for use within Temples or Shrines to Isis; and for dabbing on your third-eye to protect you from evil. I also use it for anointing rituals. I highly recommend this brand and product.</li>
    <li> I received the frankincense eo quickly and unharmed. It smelled really good too. I have yet to put it in anything yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders. I&#x27;ve purchased alot of oils from them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance  of this brand. I&#x27;ve had other frankincense  products that I prefer and smell better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil before, and it is great, every bit as potent and soothing as other Frankincense \\&quot;therapeutic\\&quot; essential oils I&#x27;ve used.   Got this in record time.  Will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love love love it! I added it to my oil mixture for cleansing as well as to my facial moisturizing oil.  My skin is so soft, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any fine lines yet!</li>
    <li> Great smell..Using it in many products with good results. Kinda masculine and good for designing male products that are natural.</li>
    <li> Wow! I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what I was getting when I ordered this. I had only smelled Frankincense a few times in my life, but I knew this oils has so many fantastic uses, I sprung for this. This is now in my top favorite oils. Rich, warm, and comforting... Amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Some EOs can have a chemical undertone, but not this one! It&#x27;s clean!!&lt;br /&gt;I keep pulling this out over and over again. I&#x27;ve been adding it to other oils, especially other useful ones I don&#x27;t enjoy the smell of to even out the overall scent for usefulness. It&#x27;s a great balancer and scent masker, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense can be used for Amnesia, Arthritis, Depression, Inflammation, Mental Fatigue, Multiple Sclerosis, Wrinkles, and much, much more!  I even add it to my own blend of icy hot mix: base oil (sweet almond) with peppermint, clove, and frankincense. It works for sore muscles &amp; even menstrual cramps.</li>
    <li> I have never used another brand oil, however this one has worked wonders on my husband&#x27;s sinuses. He has been fighting with allergies, sinus infections and congestion for months now. After 2 days of him using Frankincense in a vapor bath his swelling in his sinus went away and his congestion and sneezing has almost completely went away!! The infection is gone too!! He has polyps as well but I do not think they are bothering him as much either. Great product!!</li>
    <li> This frankincense does not have the citrus scent that some other brands have, but I still found it to be very relaxing.  So far I have tried 2 different brands and this one seems to be on par.</li>
    <li> I like Frankincense oil, and this brand is pretty good, but not as strong as another brand I&#x27;ve tried. For the price, it is good.</li>
    <li> Have loved getting Plant Therapy Essential Oils. Never a issue and they come wrapped in bubble wrap plus a shipping envelope. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The product was great, once it arrives.  It took almost 12 days to arrive. I would have putchased elsewhere with expedited shipping had I known</li>
    <li> I received the item so quick. Used it for my terrible sciatica pain because of severe lower back herniated disc. I mixed this oil together with Helichrysum and avocado oil as carrier oil. Works amazing! It helped in easing pain and sometimes no need for me to take my pain meds. Thank you so much Plant therapy!!!!</li>
    <li> Recommended for my allergy treatment.  Use it for my nose with Q-tip and apply vasseline over it.&lt;br /&gt;Clears my nose right away and last for a while.  Numbers of sneezing decreases.</li>
    <li> This is not frankinsence ..the smell is horrid and the bad part is you can replace or return this product so i guess i am out of pocket with a product that is the worst oil i have ever smelled..aroma therapy is what i offer to my people ..this was a total waste !!! I want my money back or a exchange !!!!</li>
    <li> The quality of this oil compared to the quality of the doTerra oil is commensurate with the difference in price. Everything about it, from the smell to the texture to the effectiveness in treating minor skin blemishes is simply inferior to the other product. That being said, who can afford $70 for 10 mils of any type of oil?</li>
    <li> this is a great essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;it is very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;it has tons of uses.&lt;br /&gt;I would very highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of essential oils.  Was looking forward to an effective Frankincense but this product has yet to be effective.  The fragrance is way too subtle for such a delicious oil. It always leaves me wanting more. Not in a good way; because it burns less efficiently and doesn&#x27;t linger as it should/could.  Disappointed in this product. I diffuse it alone in plain water knowing that if blend with other oils it will be lost in the mix.</li>
    <li> Smells good; Have not used ityet.</li>
    <li> I love ordering from Plant Therapy.  Their orders are always packaged carefully and delivered promptly.  The frankincense essential oil has so many great skin benefits.  I love using it in my beauty products!</li>
    <li> Like this oil very much. Just needed a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Pure 100% oil , as stated</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and works immediately for calming purposes. I&#x27;m pregnant and have needed to find an essential oil for my diffuser that will help with anxiety and emotional stress. It&#x27;s been exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> As described- good shipping</li>
    <li> Not sure what it does... But like the smell in my mister.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with some pain I was experiencing in my hand,from a car accident. Really seemed to help. I just put a little on the painful areas before going to work after work and before bed.</li>
    <li> Works good, doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as young living</li>
    <li> Smells great, seems to be very potent and much less expensive than buying it from doterra or young living.</li>
    <li> Love it...great price!</li>
    <li> Hardly smelled at all.  All I can say is yes it is oil... but it was a bad product.</li>
    <li> This was not what I had hoped for as an alternative medicine.  I love essential oils.  This one did not live up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in timely manner. Oil seems to be of good quality. I am pleased with this purchase so far, although this IS the first time I&#x27;ve purchased Frankincense, so I have nothing to compare it to. I did a lot of research on EO brands, though. And this one seemed to be one of the most trusted (outside of spending tons of money on the more popular brands). I did learn that cheaper doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean less quality. Some companies simply don&#x27;t put the extra money into having certain oils approved for consumption (which can be costly), therefore allowing you to save money. Most people I know would never ingest an EO anyway. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and think it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> Pleased with my frankincense  serrata essential oil.  Fast and secure shipping.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this particular bottle arrived empty.  Since I live in Alaska, returns sometimes mean wasted money and more hassle.  I became aware that if I return this particular defective/damaged item I receive a refund...but no exchange.  This means I have to spend $25, again, to get free shipping on the new bottle or just foot the bill for shipping which would be more expensive than just purchasing the bottle elsewhere.  Had I known about the return policy, I would not have ordered oils because they could easily become damaged during shipping and/or the bottle could be defective (as in this case) and all the oil ends up in the box or evaporated.  At least the box smelled nice.</li>
    <li> Excellent Service;  Accurate Product Description</li>
    <li> Would order again from this company, product comes in a dark brown bottle that is important in keeping sunlight out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not entirely certain it&#x27;s PURE frankincense, especially since frankincense is normally such an expensive oil and this was fairly cheap in comparison.  It&#x27;s helping with back and arthritis pain, but has a weird underlying smell I can&#x27;t place.  I wonder if it&#x27;s cut with something else?</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works great! Diluted with coconut oil, this works wonders on a diaper rash!</li>
    <li> Thus far I have found nothing not to like about this product.  I purchased it to help in removing long established sun spots on&lt;br /&gt;my face, arms and hands.  Have been using it about 1 week and so far it does seem to be having an effect.  I would want to&lt;br /&gt;continue using at least a month or more before commenting deffinitely yea or nea on it.  I bought this at the suggestion of a&lt;br /&gt;person who deals in natural supplements.  I have used some of his supplements with great results for 2 or 3 years, but he does&lt;br /&gt;not sell essential oils.  Anyone using an essential oil that does not have a carrier oil in it, should test it first.  Sometimes skin can&lt;br /&gt;be too sensitive to use the pure form of essential oil.  I have used frankincense oil with a carrier oil and it was much less effective than the pure oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent and great price, this oil is literally a God send.  I bought for my wife for her debilitating shoulder and neck pain, after rubbing the oil on her painful areas she was noticing results within a week.  Amazing and so sad this is not well known, so many people addicted to painkillers, but no doctor mentions this oil, shame shame !!! Do your own research, 5 stars here!!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as advertised and arrived as pronised.</li>
    <li> Wrong plant for most of us looking for Frankincense...make sure you are looking at the botanical name!</li>
    <li> Frankincense is one of those magic compounds -- from eyes to arthritis.  This version of it was well priced and works.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this smell. It was used once in a church I attended for their healing with oil service and I had to purchase some of this oil myself.</li>
    <li> I am trying this brand for a month and then will decide if I like it.</li>
    <li> I have found this grade of frankincense to be helpful for overall body soreness. A friend recommended this and I tried it. Used consistently, it works really well. It does not work well if not applied daily or as soon as you get that twinge that precedes soreness. But used in the correct way, this oil is marvelous as a natural solution. I wold strongly recommend it to people who are not interested in Western medicine.</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance - works wonderfully in face serum, salves, &amp; bath bombs. I do love this scent!</li>
    <li> This is really amazing-it healed a basal cell carcinoma on my  nose!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil! It has helped my husband has neck and shoulder pain, and rubbing in Frankincense with some olive oil had helped tremendously!  I&#x27;ve used doterra and I&#x27;ve been really impressed with Plant Therapy Essential Oils and have recommend them to others that want oils and have gone to doterra classes but couldn&#x27;t afford their costs and will continue to recommend you!</li>
    <li> Use Plant Therapy Essential Oils for many things.  They are wonderful and you get a top quality oil at a very fair price.</li>
    <li> I needed this oil for some rituals I was doing and it is great. It smells good and mixes easily with my myrrh oil.</li>
    <li> very nice along with quick delivery1</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy is worth a try.  I am very impressed with the quality of this brand.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very pleased with this product; i was looking for something with 100% purity and i found it with this frankincense</li>
    <li> I use Frankincense Oil for sarcoids on horses. Helps diminish them when applied daily for a month or so. Really effective. This product is pure and works great!</li>
