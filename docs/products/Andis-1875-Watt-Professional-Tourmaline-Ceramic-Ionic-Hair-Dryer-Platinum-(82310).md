      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I straightens hair perfectly and is fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer!  </li>
      <li>This blow dryer was inexpensive and effective.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t match liked</li>
      <li>but overall is it a great dryer for a great price.</li>
      <li>This dryer is quit a bit heavier to hold than most.</li>
      <li>I take it with me on trips, and my friends and their children on more than one occassion have asked to use it.</li>
      <li>The color is more gray than bronze</li>
      <li>the first still works, good product.</li>
      <li>, it was too easy to accidentally hit them while holding the handle.</li>
      <li>I am super duper pleased with this blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>Performance; so far, so good.</li>
      <li>Really just love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>The dryer works awesome, it dries my hair in half the time my old revlon dryer did.  </li>
      <li>I really did need a new hair dryer and this one was reasonable in price and the features looked good on paper.  </li>
      <li>- it dries my hair quickly and has a very long cord (my favorite part).</li>

      <li>I have a lot of fine shoulder length blonde hair.  </li>

      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>did not love this - exchanged for the Babybliss Pro BAB2000 and love it!</li>
      <li>Considering how many hair dryers are on the market at this price point, I would definitely recommend purchasing a different one.</li>
      <li>In fact I thought I had more than with my everyday cheaper ConAir blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>I will use for a bit, but am pretty sure I will break down and buy a replacement sooner rather than later.</li>
      <li>This one does not dry very fast.</li>
      <li>My hair does feel soft but that alone isnt worth keeping this, so back it goes.</li>
      <li>I was also surprised at how loud it was as well.  </li>
      <li>On its lowest setting it is still too loud.  </li>
      <li>I did think it dried my hair failry quickly</li>
      <li>The dryer was pretty heavy.</li>

<li> Reviewed a few years ago.</li>
<li> this common for Andis hair dryers?</li>

<li> The only disappointment was the color!  </li>
<li> Noise isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>

    <li> I am super duper pleased with this blow dryer.  I take it with me on trips, and my friends and their children on more than one occassion have asked to use it. I straightens hair perfectly and is fairly quickly. It also doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST HAIR DRYER I&#x27;ve ever had****!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The color is more gray than bronze so it doesn&#x27;t match liked I hoped.  Easy to grip, non twist cord and multiple settings. Performance; so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Reviewed a few years ago. Works great!</li>
    <li> The only disappointment was the color!  In the photo it looks quite gold (although it states beige) but it definitely is not the color as is shown.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was inexpensive and effective. I like that it has temp &amp; speed settings separately and the cord is very long.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the unit I received was defective, on the first use, the handle became too hot to hold.  Did not like the placement of the switches either, it was too easy to accidentally hit them while holding the handle. The dryer was pretty heavy.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this blow drier and says that it dries her hair faster than the one it replaced. I read other reviews about it being heavy, we didn&#x27;t experience that. Noise isn&#x27;t too bad. The controls work properly and the attachments, while likely to break in time if not treated with care, work well too. Note this unit doesn&#x27;t have a folding handle or retracting cord. For the price hopefully it&#x27;ll work well and for a long time since it lacks those features. Will update review if necessary.</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail today and it is going back tomorrow morning!  I bought this dryer based on the description that is very quiet.  On its lowest setting it is still too loud.  It is also kinda clunky and heavier than I expected. I have used blow-dryers for over 30 years now and I have never had one this loud or clumsy feeling. This item is just not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!  The only thing I would change about it is the design of the handle, it took me a awhile to get used to but overall is it a great dryer for a great price.</li>
    <li> This will be the blow dryer I continue to buy unless they quit making it.  I always break mine by dropping it or stepping on the plug and bending the prongs.  However, this blow dryer is WONDERFUL - it dries my hair quickly and has a very long cord (my favorite part). I&#x27;ve bought three of these - they make great gifts, as well.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. the first still works, good product.</li>
    <li> The description says \\&quot;beige\\&quot;, but what I received was surprisingly grey. My bathroom is in beige colors, so I really wanted the colors to match. Otherwise the hair dryer works well for now (one week).</li>
    <li> Excellent product, thank you</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this blow dryer and just used it for the first time and whoa is this heavy!  I was also surprised at how loud it was as well.  I did think it dried my hair failry quickly but it did not reduce any frizz.  In fact I thought I had more than with my everyday cheaper ConAir blow dryer.  I have a lot of fine shoulder length blonde hair.  My hair does feel soft but that alone isnt worth keeping this, so back it goes.</li>
    <li> did not love this - exchanged for the Babybliss Pro BAB2000 and love it!</li>
    <li> Started smoking after 2 minutes on first use.</li>
    <li> Considering how many hair dryers are on the market at this price point, I would definitely recommend purchasing a different one. This one does not dry very fast. It is also a little on the heavy side. The worst part is the handle gets incredibly hot to the touch. I would have returned it, but the box had already been thrown out. I will use for a bit, but am pretty sure I will break down and buy a replacement sooner rather than later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve being needing a great dryer &amp; this is the best. It does everything it&#x27;s say in the description product!</li>
    <li> I really did need a new hair dryer and this one was reasonable in price and the features looked good on paper.  I received this dryer one week ago and have been blown away by it since.  Other reviews were leery of the on/off switch placement but I have had no problems with it.  The dryer works awesome, it dries my hair in half the time my old revlon dryer did.  The only con is that I was hoping for a retractable cord and this does not have one.  Really just love this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is quit a bit heavier to hold than most. Middle of the handle gets hotter the longer you use it making this very uncomfortable to use while drying hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this common for Andis hair dryers?</li>
