### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>That said it would be ideal for lighter colored/white hair.  </li>
      <li>It does make the scalp and hair look great but</li>
      <li>and I recommend it as a great addition to my morning routine.</li>
      <li>nice scent with citrus notes ideal for summer, or spring</li>
      <li>This tonic smells great when I put it on, and feels good too.</li>
      <li>And it tastes good too.</li>
      <li>Good stuff</li>
      <li>Loved it.</li>
      <li>Great stuff--been using it for more than 20 years.</li>
      <li>very satisfied with this purchase</li>
      <li>It smells nice but is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Soothing, and nicely scented.</li>
      <li>great product really happy fast delivery time</li>
      <li>I like orange, and it smells nice for oh, about 12 minutes, then it&#x27;s gone, so no harm no foul.</li>
      <li>So I probably will not buy this again because honestly I just don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
      <li>Just rub warm water all through your hair, towel away the excess, sprinkle some of this on and mix in.  </li>
      <li>It smells great but the smell dissipates quickly so it won&#x27;t conflict with any colognes you wear.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best hair tonic ever.</li>
      <li>It has a mild scent, and it&#x27;s good when you wake up on the weekends</li>
      <li>Greaseless refreshing and controlling.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Cools scalp itch( check out Pinaud Quinine for more relief)</li>
      <li>smells better once on and tingles a bit.</li>
      <li>Gives your hair a nice luster, and keeps your hair clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>The scent of this product is outstanding,  like orange peels and cheap vodka, if you can get into that sort of thing... I do.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Scent is light and disappears after an hour or so.</li>
      <li>Tipped the bottle right up on top in the front of my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm</li>
      <li>It does not feel particularly clean or invigorating, to me.  </li>
      <li>look but it will still work on perfectly clean hair.  </li>
      <li>My hands felt clean without any residue</li>
      <li>Massage into damp hair for  better styling  than water alone,although it does not impart much hold.</li>
      <li>I smell better, I feel better, and damn if my penis didn&#x27;t grow bigger from using Eau De Portugal.</li>
      <li>It really does keep me itch free when I use it every day</li>
      <li>I liked it enough of the Clubman products I&#x27;d tried to warrant a cautious go at this one. .</li>
      <li>These retro Pinaud products are downright fun to use.</li>
      <li>The tonic massages into my hair and scalp well enough, and smells nice</li>
      <li>how exactly do you use this stuff?&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>and you just want that first cup of coffee, but don&#x27;t want to show up in the kitchen with messed up hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wet</li>
      <li>Very orange, my friends.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough to try, and if you don&#x27;t like Orange- DON&#x27;T get it.</li>
      <li>but when I tried them I really WENT for them.</li>
      <li>I do really like this for those days when I don&#x27;t care about how I look.</li>
      <li>Very orangey.</li>
      <li>It quickly became part of my daily ritual.</li>
      <li>If you are older and blessed with ridges in your nails</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Wait I&#x27;m not 65-70 years old and I live this stuff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>someone just sat next to you on the train and ate a whole orange and rubbed it on your hair type of orange.</li>
      <li>This product tames wild bed-head hair without being the slightest bit oily or greasy.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of the old days when going to a barbershop with my Dad and having the barber pour this on my head after a cut.</li>
      <li>DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON.</li>
      <li>The alcohol helps re-distribute the natural oils evenly</li>
      <li>Ladies, get this for your man and get ready for a hard-rocking night of multiple orgasms.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve read several reviews that say &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; and you really don&#x27;t like orange and are hoping that it&#x27;s all just orange to our noses and won&#x27;t be to yours-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing like the other \\&quot;Clubman Pinaud Eau de Portugal Hair Tonic\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve purchased before and certainly not like the scent I&#x27;ve grown to love.</li>
      <li>Seems to calm down itching too.</li>
      <li>(Citrusy and manly and not froofy at all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does actually give a bit of a soft lustre n</li>

<li> I sometimes get in cold dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> you&#x27;re wrong.</li>
<li> Men, you will never go wrong with this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Greaseless refreshing and controlling. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> Massage into damp hair for  better styling  than water alone,although it does not impart much hold. Subtle gin-and-tonic with lime aroma. Cools scalp itch( check out Pinaud Quinine for more relief) It quickly became part of my daily ritual. These retro Pinaud products are downright fun to use.My wife loves them on me.</li>
    <li> Great stuff--been using it for more than 20 years.</li>
    <li> If you are older and blessed with ridges in your nails this is a must for you!  (You can even use it without nail polish on top!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It covers all the icky ridges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a blessing to find it at Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find anything like this at a drugstore.</li>
    <li> As with all things Clubman, you have to approach them with a degree of calculated brashness and cautious trepidation. Some of their products are just NOT for me- but when I tried them I really WENT for them. You can&#x27;t dabble in a Clubman product, you have to wholeheartedly BE the Clubman- even if it&#x27;s only for one day. They&#x27;re French, after all. So it was with this here hair stuff. I liked it enough of the Clubman products I&#x27;d tried to warrant a cautious go at this one. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells... like an orange. Very orangey. If you&#x27;ve read several reviews that say &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; and you really don&#x27;t like orange and are hoping that it&#x27;s all just orange to our noses and won&#x27;t be to yours- you&#x27;re wrong. This is like, ... someone just sat next to you on the train and ate a whole orange and rubbed it on your hair type of orange. Very orange, my friends. That said- I like orange, and it smells nice for oh, about 12 minutes, then it&#x27;s gone, so no harm no foul. When I put it in my hair and some VIBR on my face I smell, according to my wife, &amp;#34;like Christmas.&amp;#34; So you like Christmas, don&#x27;t you??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s it? No- the performance of this stuff is rather underwhelming, it&#x27;s hard to say whether it has any long term effect on the hair, except that I&#x27;ve noticed it stays a little cleaner &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; if I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, which I don&#x27;t- get over it. So yeah. It&#x27;s cheap enough to try, and if you don&#x27;t like Orange- DON&#x27;T get it.</li>
    <li> I do really like this for those days when I don&#x27;t care about how I look. It does make the scalp and hair look great but it doesn&#x27;t hold at all, it dries and it feels as if nothing was put in. Which isn&#x27;t always a bad thing. It does smell like citrus, almost like a gin with a splash of orange.</li>
    <li> So it doesnt have quite the staying power that the Osage Rub has at least for me.  That said it would be ideal for lighter colored/white hair.  I read one review where a wife used the Clubman Quinine (red in color) on her husband&#x27;s white hair which turned it pink.  Know your product before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice scent with citrus notes ideal for summer, or spring although I use it year round.</li>
    <li> The smell is terrible. I used it for a few weeks and finally threw it out. Back to Vitalis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost some faith in amazon.com recently after this order. I don&#x27;t know if any of the other \\&quot;Clubman\\&quot; items I&#x27;ve received from the same order are fakes, but this one is. It smells like gasoline. It&#x27;s nothing like the other \\&quot;Clubman Pinaud Eau de Portugal Hair Tonic\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve purchased before and certainly not like the scent I&#x27;ve grown to love. BUYER BEWARE AND SHAME ON YOU AMAZON.COM . DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Eau de Portugal for over 30 years. It is often hard to order or find. Amazon and the Regatta Group made it a snap. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Wait I&#x27;m not 65-70 years old and I live this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife got me a bunch of stuff from clubman for Xmas. Among it was was the aud de Portugal hair scalp tonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened this stuff gave it a sniff and thought. This is probably what the Rat Pack dudes smelled like ...booze n lime OR Gin n Tonic and soap. What&#x27;s cooler than the Rat Pack dudes of days gone by.?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium long dark blonde hair so I went for it. Tipped the bottle right up on top in the front of my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm smells better once on and tingles a bit. (Citrusy and manly and not froofy at all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does actually give a bit of a soft lustre n shine to the hair. Without feeling oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I put some through the rest of my hair n scalp. Loved it. My hands felt clean without any residue only fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And It Does ease dry scalp itch I sometimes get in cold dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instant nostalgia.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff</li>
    <li> Good stuff .nice smell.</li>
    <li> This tonic smells great when I put it on, and feels good too. It really does keep me itch free when I use it every day and I recommend it as a great addition to my morning routine.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the old days when going to a barbershop with my Dad and having the barber pour this on my head after a cut. You can feel the product working. Gives your hair a nice luster, and keeps your hair clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> seems to work for me wakes up scalp in the morning.I use witjh a dandruf shampoo.Last quite awhile in daily use</li>
    <li> This product tames wild bed-head hair without being the slightest bit oily or greasy. My hair is thin on top, but this gives me style-ability without plastering my hair down. It smells nice but is not overpowering. Seems to calm down itching too. Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> I keep seeing people ask &amp;#34;just how exactly do you use this stuff?&amp;#34;  This was made for a time when people didn&#x27;t wash their hair every day as a way to get rid of that &amp;#34;sleepy head&amp;#34; look but it will still work on perfectly clean hair.  Just rub warm water all through your hair, towel away the excess, sprinkle some of this on and mix in.  The alcohol helps re-distribute the natural oils evenly so now you can comb your hair into some semblance of order. It smells great but the smell dissipates quickly so it won&#x27;t conflict with any colognes you wear.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  It has a mild scent, and it&#x27;s good when you wake up on the weekends and you just want that first cup of coffee, but don&#x27;t want to show up in the kitchen with messed up hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wet your hair down, sprinkle it with this, rub it in, towel dry, it&#x27;s like you just got out of the shower.  Refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is light and disappears after an hour or so.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair tonic ever. I smell better, I feel better, and damn if my penis didn&#x27;t grow bigger from using Eau De Portugal. Men, you will never go wrong with this product. Ladies, get this for your man and get ready for a hard-rocking night of multiple orgasms. And it tastes good too.</li>
    <li> I had an itchy scalp. It stopped itching the moment I started using Eau de Portugal. It&#x27;s an essential for my grooming.</li>
    <li> Soothing, and nicely scented.</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is outstanding,  like orange peels and cheap vodka, if you can get into that sort of thing... I do.  The tonic massages into my hair and scalp well enough, and smells nice but I am not sure what it does for me after that!  It does not feel particularly clean or invigorating, to me.  It provides almost no hold (though I didn&#x27;t expect it would, just saying.)  So I probably will not buy this again because honestly I just don&#x27;t get it.  I&#x27;ve purchased other tonics and rubs (clubman products even) that do what this does plus a few other benefits.</li>
    <li> Shipped two of same. I ordered one each to include the Quinine Tonic</li>
    <li> great product really happy fast delivery time</li>
