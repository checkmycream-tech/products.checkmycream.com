    <li> I am 29 and had never broken out, then all of a sudden I was breaking out all the time.  They were leaving scars and I am really pale so I was felt really self conscious about it.  I started using this with Clindamycin (prescribed by my dermatologist) and together they have really helped clear up my acne and fade the red marks left behind.  I am feeling much better these days.  I still get blackheads and my skin is not perfect, but it really has gotten rid of the big ones that were leaving their marks on my face for months after.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve previously tried retinol and received immediately a dry and irritated skin. I have a very sensitive skin. I am using it now for two days and  I can already see a difference: my skin is perfectly hydrated and no irritation at all. Also I see the fine lines around my mouth diminish so I will definitely order it again! Hope this will help.</li>
    <li> This is the most luxurious face moisturizer I have ever used. A friend gave me a bottle a few years ago &amp; I have never used anything else since. It is a bit expensive, but a little bit goes a long way. This formula has worked great on my very sensitive skin. It does not contain mineral oil &amp; it does not make my face break out, yay! This formula feels silky when you put it on &amp; does feel a bit oily at fist, however your skin quickly absorbs the moisturizer leaving your face with a smooth, moisturized feeling. This is a good seller. The item was delivered quickly &amp; I will use them again for future orders.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT.  I HAVE TRIED 4 OR 5 OF THEIR PRODUCES LIKE THEM ALL.</li>
    <li> I started using Neova Retinol about 2 years ago as a preventative anti-ager. Retinol is the only scientifically proven anti-aging product and Neova is the best product I have found. I have continued to use Neova because of the difference it has made in my skin. Before I had big pores and blotchy skin with weekly acne. Now, I hardly ever get a zit, my pores have minimized, and my skin looks 10 years younger! This product goes on smooth, does not cause redness or irritation and can even be used under the eyes. It is a must-have.</li>
    <li> I never had a bump in my life until I was 35. I&#x27;m now 42 and have bought hundreds of products and nothing works for me. I started using this product and noticed immediate results.  My face cleared up. I ran out and my face broke out again. I put this on as soon as I received it and it was instant relief. It is great for sensitive skin and is very soothing. I also have sun damage and it has helped with that too.</li>
    <li> I gave 3 stars because it is too early to evaluate. Usually need a minimum of 30 days use with 60 days being average for seeing results. This creme goes on easily and absorbs quickly. The feel is silky. Have not really seen a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very gentle to the skin and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> this cream is great will recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I think I am seeing results but the jury is still out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks now.</li>
    <li> This product it the best thing ever. My face look so radiant!  Will be purchasing another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> Very nice product............goes really well with NIGHT THERAPY (which I am out of!!!)</li>
    <li> I started using it eight weeks ago and I am shocked at the results. My acne scarring is noticeably diminished and my skin looks great!  In fairness my entire facial routine plays a part in it and I swear by it!! I cleanse with grape seed oil, I use this product at night and I moisturize with Moroccan Argon Oil. In the morning I use Cosmedica Pure Hyaluronic Serum.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Not as harsh as retin A. Definitely can see an improvement in skin texture.</li>
    <li> Very good product, everyone should try it!</li>
    <li> After a good chemical peel wait about a few days and use this at night only/give three weeks and see results.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this product. Is it even retinol? It felt heavy and almost greasy. No instructions. Do you use moisturizer or not?! I won&#x27;t reorder. I think it broke my face out. I couldn&#x27;t tell when the product was running low because the way the pump is designed.</li>
    <li> I see results after 1 week. I use it at night and I feel my skin get softer and fine lines are reduced and some are gone. I like this</li>
    <li> My skin does look better but I have to wait a little longer. Wish they gave you a little more quanitity.</li>
