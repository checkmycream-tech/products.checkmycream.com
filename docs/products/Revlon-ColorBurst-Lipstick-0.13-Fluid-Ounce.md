    <li> I like this color, it is exactly what I expected.  It stays on for awhile and I like the &amp;#34;lightness&amp;#34; of this product, not a heavy feeling lipstick.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This lipstick has no staying power.  Also, it is lighter in color than shown.  It is definitely not a full-coverage lipstick.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>

    <li> I took it as gift to others but ended up using for myself. Good one with reasonable price compared to other sites</li>

    <li> Fast shipping, product came brand new in perfect condition. Love this color on myself, great for everyday. I think this color (brick redish brown) would be flattering on any skintone. Awesome price as well!</li>
    <li> The # is the same as they used to sell in the store (and been discontinued) .... But the color isn&#x27;t the same..</li>

    <li> The product is viewed as red; however, it is no where near red.
