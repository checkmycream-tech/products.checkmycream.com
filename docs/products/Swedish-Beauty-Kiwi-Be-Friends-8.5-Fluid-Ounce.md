      <li>I love the smell as it reminds me of the tropics.</li>
      <li>I love Kiwi</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS TANNING LOTION.  </li>
      <li>SMELLS GOOD, AND LEAVES YOU GOLDEN BROWN</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this stuff</li>
      <li>This worked awesome, and really helped me get the golden tan</li>
      <li>Smells sooo good and gets me really tan!</li>
      <li>Great small and works great</li>
      <li>It smells great and gave her a natural gold tan.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy or colored and absorbs easily.</li>
      <li>A lot goes a long way with this one, which is incredible.</li>
      <li>Works great, but not for a deep color.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it in a tanning bed but this works great for outdoors, only used it a couple times and so far it has worked very well, gives me a great tan.</li>
      <li>My fiancé is tanning to get ready for a wedding, and absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I like the mild bronzer included.</li>
      <li>Gives me a lovely, natural tan fairly quickly and leaves the skin nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Received product very fast!</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite lotion without spending over $100.</li>
      <li>I much, much prefer the Shea lotion, but this one is not bad at all.</li>
      <li>I have been tanning for many years and every year I try a different lotion.</li>
      <li>You Love Me from the same company.</li>
      <li>Bought my first bottle of this at my tanning salon for $40!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried a sample of this at my local tanning salon and fell in love immediately, but of course they didn&#x27;t carry the bottle</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bronzer, which I didn&#x27;t realize, but it doesn&#x27;t give that hot itchy feel after using.</li>
      <li>The gym sells this lotion at a much higher price.</li>
      <li>kind of like you smoked a little something.</li>
      <li>This lotion I have bought twice this year alone because it helps me tan fast and keep the color and smells</li>
      <li>It works well in the tanning beds and much cheaper than buying it at the salon.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing too.  </li>
      <li>this lotion didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
      <li>It takes a bit longer to dry after applying and doesn&#x27;t rub in quite as easily as the Shea, and this has a much stronger scent to it..</li>
      <li>Natural looking, not fake.</li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very moturizing and gives you than natural tint of color.</li>
      <li>Not the normal baked after tan smell.</li>
      <li>This is a new tanning lotion for me.</li>
      <li>Made my skin so soft and supple!</li>
      <li>lotion is a medium thickness, applies easily, smells fruity, and has a very slight shimmer.</li>
      <li>This product, although it leaves the skin soft and produces an average tan has a strong odor that is not appealing after tanning.</li>

    <li> smells SO good after tanning. i&#x27;m use to that gross tanning lotion smell before and after. but this smells just like how it is in the bottle, amazing!

    <li> This has an awesome smell even after you tan. It is very moisturizing too.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this at my local tanning salon and fell in love immediately, but of course they didn&#x27;t carry the bottle so I had to order it here. This lotion is AMAZING. It has the best scent ever, like kiwi Kool-Aid and rubs in very well. And it works great for indoor tanning as well as outdoor tanning! I used it during my yearly trip to the beach for the passed 2 years with great results. Not to mention you will tan to the perfect shade of caramel, lol. This is the ONLY tanning lotion I use and I recommend it to everyone. Definitely a great lotion for the price.</li>
    <li> Received product very fast! Was very happy with service. Would order again absolutley!  Loved the lotion it is my favorite!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this lotion.  It works well in the tanning beds and much cheaper than buying it at the salon.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended me this lotion because of the glow and the good smell. I am hooked! This lotion is very moturizing and gives you than natural tint of color. I love the smell as it reminds me of the tropics. The gym sells this lotion at a much higher price. So happy to find it online!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an experienced fake-baker and while I appreciate lotions with DHA, I hate the after tan smell. I&#x27;m enjoying the KIWI Be Friends product a lot.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is a medium thickness, applies easily, smells fruity, and has a very slight shimmer. It is not greasy or colored and absorbs easily. I did not notice a heavy &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; or DHA smell. There is an &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; odor when I sniff my arm arm but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming. The Amazon price on this lotion is very good and if it didn&#x27;t have a tiny bit of shimmer in it, I would say it&#x27;s unisex. I will use the tube up and try other swedish beauty formulas.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this lotion! I had never used a bronzer lotion before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It didn&#x27;t stain or leave streaks and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is a new tanning lotion for me. It&#x27;s a bronzer, which I didn&#x27;t realize, but it doesn&#x27;t give that hot itchy feel after using. I like the tropical light smell and it assists in great color without a sensitivity reaction.</li>

    <li> I love Kiwi Be Friends. It is a great product and works very well for me.  I&#x27;m getting great tanning results. Natural looking, not fake. And the scent is great too :  )</li>
    <li> I tan quite often, so this lotion didn&#x27;t do much for me. Tho it is an awesome moisturizer with a lovely fruity smell</li>
    <li> Does the job at a great price point. I like the mild bronzer included.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GOOD, AND LEAVES YOU GOLDEN BROWN</li>
    <li> Bought my first bottle of this at my tanning salon for $40!&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to look for this online. I bought it for $19 I see now that it is even cheaper. le sigh.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product if you are fair skinned and new to tanning beds. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Bought this after I ran out of the Shea You Love Me from the same company. I much, much prefer the Shea lotion, but this one is not bad at all. A lot goes a long way with this one, which is incredible. It takes a bit longer to dry after applying and doesn&#x27;t rub in quite as easily as the Shea, and this has a much stronger scent to it.. NOT a tanning scent though. Definitely a fruity, kiwi smell but I still wouldn&#x27;t wear it just walking around. I&#x27;ve only used this outside, so I can&#x27;t attest to the after-bed smell of it. Gives me a lovely, natural tan fairly quickly and leaves the skin nice and soft.</li>
