### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it&#x27;s almost perfect.  </li>
      <li>However, now I&#x27;m using it just around my eyes and lip area, and I think it works great.</li>
      <li>This cream, used along with a serum, is great.  </li>
      <li>All I   know is that I&#x27;m happy with its results on MY skin.  </li>
      <li>We are guys who like ointments and serums and some lotions and are impressed with the Health &amp; Beauty industry and enjoy the controversy over who&#x27;s best.  </li>
      <li>luck on your search for your perfect cream :)</li>
      <li>I too read many wonderful reviews about this product before I decided to purchase.</li>
      <li>The product came on time and in good condition</li>
      <li>Online research for a good antiwrinkle cream, in my price range, led me to Oxytokin.</li>
      <li>One good thing is about this product</li>
      <li>I am very light skinned, have a good gene pool on my side, but age does happen!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it works best right after I&#x27;ve exfoliated (twice a week)</li>
      <li>I checked on line which cream was best and this was first</li>
      <li>The reviews for this product are amazing.  </li>
      <li>I do not know yet how effective it is.</li>
      <li>About as effective  in preventing wrinkles as a tanning bed.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything as effective, and for the price...</li>
      <li>Another case of \\&quot;if a deal seems to good to be true, that&#x27;s because it probably is\\&quot;!</li>
      <li>This product does help reduce very fine lines, but has not affected my wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I had been using Strivectin SD, loved the results but not the cost; so I figured I would do a little research and find the best product for the money.  </li>
      <li>Fewer wrinkles, better complexion.</li>
      <li>I am wondering if it would be better for people with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I received so many emails I had to unsubscribe and was disillusioned with the product before I even had a chance to receive and use it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best claim is that it contains Argireline, a topical muscle relaxant, and sodium hyaluronate, an acid that traps moisture in the skin and plumps it.</li>
      <li>However, they do point out Redeaux leaves most of the ingredients out, so somewhat of a mystique.  </li>
      <li>Love this cream.  </li>
      <li>YET :) I have combination skin.</li>
      <li>Since I didn&#x27;t expect miracles to begin with, I was more than pleased with how well it moisterized.  </li>
      <li>On several sites it is listed as one of the best anti-wrinkle creams on the market.  </li>
      <li>I was/am hopeful to find a cream I LOVE that wont break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can spend much, much more.</li>
      <li>Purchased ROC moisturizer and saw remarkable in all lines and wrinkles and a much firmer face in three weeks.</li>
      <li>What we noticed is the finishes are different, Wrinkle Redeaux is the clear winner for dazzling perfect pH looking skin, takes up to 20 years off your face, while Oxytokin is a close 2nd with a different finish that lasts as long as Redeaux, just doesn&#x27;t have that knock out dazzling perfect young skin, but it DOES have one down, so dazzling perfect skin just one level down with Redeaux a perfect 10 and Oxytokin a perfect 9.  </li>
      <li>look pretty good for my age...and am VERY aware of how things affect my skin.  </li>
      <li>Go for something containing retinol and AHAs, which have been clinically proven to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>thought I had discovered a wonderful little secret,a $30 cream that out performs the $200 moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>This order is for a dear friend who I hope has the same great results I have had.</li>
      <li>It does allow foundation to blend smoothly for the am application.</li>
      <li>and I wish it was fragrance free, but I will reorder this product.</li>
      <li>I too was excited to hear the product reviews in relation to cost.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps it works better on certain types of skin?</li>
      <li>so well taken care of and full of moisture.  </li>
      <li>I got this cream more for the under eye dark circles as it says is good for too..</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s astonishing, too many pinch marks with just the 90 Second, but with Revitalift</li>
      <li>My skin was perfectly clear, bright and fresh looking, thanks to the Strivectin, before I used this product.  </li>
      <li>My Dr. prescribed Renova as a skin care regeime, it is powerful stuff, and pretty much ate the top layer of my skin.</li>
      <li>Sounds great, except it wears off within a few hours.    </li>
      <li>Definetly worth a try on yours.</li>
      <li>but well worth your while to add to your routine.  </li>
      <li>it was worth the money.</li>
      <li>Save your money for a product that has the good stuff in it, which may be more expensive, but worth using on your skin.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for almost a month and actually have more wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>She asked what I used on my face; she even wanted the exact name of the product</li>
      <li>think also that you get more jar than you do actual product for the price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I am still applying several different good moisturizers to get rid of the rope</li>
      <li>have had oxytokin for three weeks and do not notice any difference in fine lines or anything else for that matter such as; improved texture or tone.</li>
      <li>I have used the whole jar morning and evening</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect to see this much improvement.</li>
      <li>I think the lines I had beginning are much improved.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy, there are other creams that would probably work better.</li>
      <li>While this cream may prevent new fine lines from occurring, there&#x27;s no research to back up its claims.</li>
      <li>but BEFORE I had actually received the product, I received so many emails from the company wanting me to buy \\&quot;bigger and better\\&quot; products.  </li>
      <li>and we just want quality looking skin as we get older.  </li>
      <li>I believe I have fairly realistic expectations about beauty creams.</li>
      <li>I use a high powered (15x&#x27;s magnification) lighted mirror every day</li>
      <li>The cream is not greasy, smells nice, and my skin just sucks it up.</li>
      <li>Lasts all day and you can dab a little zit stick for guys or makeup for girls and then lightly blend it in by patting with your finger tip if you have any red marks, most have them on the inside next to the nose.  </li>
      <li>I received this product through another website and sent it right back after reading the ingredient list which has many questionable ingredients not listed on the webpage, including parabens that are known carcinogens (check out the EWG&#x27;s Skin   Deep Database and Safe Cosmetics Campaign).  </li>
      <li>But I probably used more than the jar&#x27;s instruction of a small amount.</li>
      <li>The makers of Oxytokin not only market the SAME EXACT product under the name Prevera, but they monopolized all of the reviews for these products, which is why the creams are ranked so highly.    </li>
      <li>Oxytokin cream is gentle enough for my sensitive skin.   </li>
      <li>I was completely hoodwinked into purchasing Oxytokin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 46 years old....</li>
      <li>(water baby from CA&#x3D;too much sun exposure&amp; a lot of squinting)No deep set wrinkles</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not make my face break out.</li>
      <li>I am aware that there are some high scale creams that show results but hit your pocketbook pretty hard.</li>
      <li>abt wrinkles being reduced yet---but very smooth, and nice base for makeup application the next day.  </li>
      <li>My complexion is much brighter and as I wrote before, fine lines are decreased.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not due to lack of water)</li>
      <li>(I am a major water drinker</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and have fine lines which this has lessened.</li>
      <li>I am in my late 30&#x27;s and have a lot of fine lines around the eyes.</li>
      <li>What tipped me off were these \\&quot;independent\\&quot; website, frequently interchanged the name and ranking of this product with Oxytokin and the products are packaged virtually identically; the only difference being the name.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t break out, I have normal sized pores and it&#x27;s medium dry with some oiliness on my forehead and the sides of my nose.</li>
      <li>Compared to   the price for some of the other items on the market, it&#x27;s reasonable.   </li>
      <li>I now have those little tiny acne bumps like you get when you work out with make-up on or don&#x27;t wash your face right away.  </li>
      <li>This is the first skin treatment product I&#x27;ve tried, so I have little  basis for comparison.</li>
      <li>Well when I first tried it, I found it too heavy for my complexion too.</li>
      <li>My skin is much smoother and I have received a ton of compliments, so other people have noticed!  </li>
      <li>Do I think any over the counter creams will erase wrinkles, NO, but I give this cream high marks as a protective barrier in bitter elements (Winter in Chicago) and plumping the overall look and feel of my skin.</li>
      <li>Normal to slightly oily in the T zone and normal to dry elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a very cheap, old lady cold cream smell and a greasy texture, nothing like Strivectin.  </li>

<li> This moisturizer consistently ranked 2nd or 3rd, and had some rather negative things to say about Strivectin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> do them one after the other and the damn thing takes every crease and wrinkle out and completely removes the puffiness below the eyes to the point</li>
<li> I decided to dig a little deeper into the reviews now that the buyers high was gone.  </li>
<li> This product does not eliminate wrinkles, which I am starting to get as I am 42 or dark circles, as I am a mom of young children, however it does make your skin glow.  </li>
<li> The only thing I noticed the first week of use was how moist my face felt, even late in the day.</li>
<li> I was told to be aware of this product due to the fact there was little info about the company that manufactures this item and any trials that were performed.  </li>
<li> At 58 and post menopause, my skin at the of the day(the day starting at 4:30 am and ending after 9pm) tended to dry out.</li>
<li> In fact, at night before bed, ten minutes after I apply oxytokin I have to add a cream to my face because it feels so dry.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product does help reduce very fine lines, but has not affected my wrinkles. It does leave my skin feeling smoother, but after 3 weeks of use, my wrinkles have not diminished. This product was touted as a &#x27;miracle cream&#x27; and I had hoped (being 25 with forehead wrinkles) that it would help repair my skin. I do, however, like the cream as a moisturizer: my skin does look healthier and it does not cause breakouts. I will continue using the cream -- it just wasn&#x27;t the miracle I was looking for. But, I hope it works wonders for anyone who tries it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  I checked on line which cream was best and this was first so I got it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the first skin treatment product I&#x27;ve tried, so I have little  basis for comparison. However, after several weeks, I&#x27;ve seen a definite  improvement in my skin. Fewer wrinkles, better complexion. Compared to   the price for some of the other items on the market, it&#x27;s reasonable.   I didn&#x27;t really expect to see this much improvement.</li>
    <li> I was told to be aware of this product due to the fact there was little info about the company that manufactures this item and any trials that were performed.  I tried it for three weeks and saw no improvement.  I would not purchase Oxytoken again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen where people say this is too greasy. Well when I first tried it, I found it too heavy for my complexion too. However, now I&#x27;m using it just around my eyes and lip area, and I think it works great. I think the lines I had beginning are much improved. I haven&#x27;t found anything as effective, and for the price...I like it alot. You can spend much, much more. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different (ie more expensive stuff). So I&#x27;m a repeat customer now for Oxtokin, and I use different stuff for my all-over face lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream thinking I&#x27;d found the miracle for $30. Unfortunately after I bought it, I decided to do a little research. The makers of Oxytokin not only market the SAME EXACT product under the name Prevera, but they monopolized all of the reviews for these products, which is why the creams are ranked so highly.    This is not a miracle cream. It&#x27;s best claim is that it contains Argireline, a topical muscle relaxant, and sodium hyaluronate, an acid that traps moisture in the skin and plumps it. So basically when you apply this cream, it lifts and fills in your wrinkles within seconds. Sounds great, except it wears off within a few hours.    Save your money. While this cream may prevent new fine lines from occurring, there&#x27;s no research to back up its claims. Go for something containing retinol and AHAs, which have been clinically proven to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Oxytokin...is over priced &amp; does not work for me.Plus the amount you get really sucks.I&#x27;ll keep using AVON...All I would like is my money back....</li>
    <li> I started looking into this product and ran into several articles claiming that all the reviews are a scam and buyer beware. I guess they have a dozen or so websites with different names, then continue with varying claims about this product from the different sites.  Don&#x27;t buy this product, it does nothing but promotes scams and snakes.</li>
    <li> Oxytokin cream is gentle enough for my sensitive skin.   It is easily absorbed, and the scent is delicate.    I do not know yet how effective it is.</li>
    <li> At 58 and post menopause, my skin at the of the day(the day starting at 4:30 am and ending after 9pm) tended to dry out. Online research for a good antiwrinkle cream, in my price range, led me to Oxytokin. The only thing I noticed the first week of use was how moist my face felt, even late in the day. My face and neck now feel and look softer--for that alone it was worth the money. By week three, I saw a slight decrease in the lines around my mouth and upper lip. Just started my second jar. Since I didn&#x27;t expect miracles to begin with, I was more than pleased with how well it moisterized.  The cream is not greasy, smells nice, and my skin just sucks it up. My only complaint is one jar didn&#x27;t last one month. But I probably used more than the jar&#x27;s instruction of a small amount.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks with not much result but it didnt cost anymore than the products that iv been buying in the store so its not too disappointing. The product came on time and in good condition</li>
    <li> I am very light skinned, have a good gene pool on my side, but age does happen! My Dr. prescribed Renova as a skin care regeime, it is powerful stuff, and pretty much ate the top layer of my skin. Not a pretty sight in the middle of winter. The topical creams I have been using just did not seem to penetrate and moisturize. On an impulse buy I purchased oxytokin, have been using it for 2 weeks and what it does is the following~ it makes your skin supple, smooths out rough uneven skin that was temporaly damaged by the elements (or in my case renova)  and gives your skin and even surface. Do I think any over the counter creams will erase wrinkles, NO, but I give this cream high marks as a protective barrier in bitter elements (Winter in Chicago) and plumping the overall look and feel of my skin. My skin is much smoother and I have received a ton of compliments, so other people have noticed!  It does have a heavier texture and I wish it was fragrance free, but I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as I too thought the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; on Google were actual reviews, but alas they were paid advertisements.  After trying a ton of products, I actually like this one.  I have sensitive skin and this does not make my face break out. This product does not eliminate wrinkles, which I am starting to get as I am 42 or dark circles, as I am a mom of young children, however it does make your skin glow.  To solidify my opinion on this product, I went to the spa for a facial and the technician told me that my skin was so well taken care of and full of moisture.  She asked what I used on my face; she even wanted the exact name of the product so she could try it!  I am going to add a retinol product to my skin care routine and I will be set.</li>
    <li> I used this cream as directed for 3 weeks. I did not notice any changes in wrinkles or age spots. I did notice these terrible dry lines around my neck. They hurt! I have not used the cream for 2 weeks and I am still applying several different good moisturizers to get rid of the rope marks this product made around the front of my neck! Am returning for a refund!</li>
    <li> I got this cream more for the under eye dark circles as it says is good for too..it does help reducing the wrinkles but I still have the dark circles after weeks of using it</li>
    <li> I have not yet purchased the product, but, sadly enough, so many frustrated customers wrote such negative remarks about it, that I decided not to waste my money.</li>
    <li> I was completely hoodwinked into purchasing Oxytokin.  I had been using Strivectin SD, loved the results but not the cost; so I figured I would do a little research and find the best product for the money.  Boy, these guys heard me coming a mile away.  They have purchased or bought off several websites that claim to rate and review all moisturizers and rank them; they basically have a monopoly on Google search.  This moisturizer consistently ranked 2nd or 3rd, and had some rather negative things to say about Strivectin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had discovered a wonderful little secret,a $30 cream that out performs the $200 moisturizers.  It wasn&#x27;t until I received the moisturizer and tried it that I began to get a little suspicious.  It has a very cheap, old lady cold cream smell and a greasy texture, nothing like Strivectin.  I decided to dig a little deeper into the reviews now that the buyers high was gone.  What I found was the supposed \\&quot;independent\\&quot; reviews were the same on each website.  They read like an advertisement for the product... which they were.  It was virtually impossible to find an actual user review. The ones I did find were mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other fishy thing.  I think this is the same cream also marketed under the name Prevera.  What tipped me off were these \\&quot;independent\\&quot; website, frequently interchanged the name and ranking of this product with Oxytokin and the products are packaged virtually identically; the only difference being the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this aside, assuming I was basing my review solely on the quality and results of this product, I would only give two stars.  My skin was perfectly clear, bright and fresh looking, thanks to the Strivectin, before I used this product.  I now have those little tiny acne bumps like you get when you work out with make-up on or don&#x27;t wash your face right away.  My skin feels constantly oily and not fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, don&#x27;t waste your money.  Let my ignorance and gullibility serve as a lesson to all would be purchasers, perform your due diligence before you buy this stuff.be purchasers, perform your due diligence before you buy this stuff.</li>
    <li> I try stuff ALLLLL the time.  And this cream....after two nites,,,i could see a DIFFERENCE.  I&#x27;m 46 years old....look pretty good for my age...and am VERY aware of how things affect my skin.  Mine was noticeably smoother in 2 nite&#x27;s of use.  Dunno abt wrinkles being reduced yet---but very smooth, and nice base for makeup application the next day.  I&#x27;m def. buying it again.</li>
    <li> I too read many wonderful reviews about this product before I decided to purchase. I believe I have fairly realistic expectations about beauty creams. I am aware that there are some high scale creams that show results but hit your pocketbook pretty hard. I was/am hopeful to find a cream I LOVE that wont break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am in my late 30&#x27;s and have a lot of fine lines around the eyes. (water baby from CA&#x3D;too much sun exposure&amp; a lot of squinting)No deep set wrinkles YET :) I have combination skin. Normal to slightly oily in the T zone and normal to dry elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had oxytokin for three weeks and do not notice any difference in fine lines or anything else for that matter such as; improved texture or tone. In fact, at night before bed, ten minutes after I apply oxytokin I have to add a cream to my face because it feels so dry. (I am a major water drinker so it&#x27;s not due to lack of water) It does allow foundation to blend smoothly for the am application. But then again, I use sunscreen after Oxy/ before foundation, so perhaps it&#x27;s the sunscreen. Maybe I have not given it enough time.  I can always change my review if I notice any improvment. I use a high powered (15x&#x27;s magnification) lighted mirror every day so I would definitely notice any changes. One good thing is about this product is that a little goes a long way. I am wondering if it would be better for people with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck on your search for your perfect cream :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m here to buy my third jar of Oxytokin. I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and have fine lines which this has lessened. I&#x27;ve found it works best right after I&#x27;ve exfoliated (twice a week) my skin. My complexion is much brighter and as I wrote before, fine lines are decreased. My skin doesn&#x27;t break out, I have normal sized pores and it&#x27;s medium dry with some oiliness on my forehead and the sides of my nose. Perhaps it works better on certain types of skin? All I   know is that I&#x27;m happy with its results on MY skin.  Definetly worth a try on yours.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product are amazing.  On several sites it is listed as one of the best anti-wrinkle creams on the market.  I have been using this product for almost a month and actually have more wrinkles.  About as effective  in preventing wrinkles as a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> We are guys who like ointments and serums and some lotions and are impressed with the Health &amp; Beauty industry and enjoy the controversy over who&#x27;s best.  The knock on Wrinkle Redeaux is it only lists 2 peptides and Oxytokin has today&#x27;s required 5 peptides to rehydrate one&#x27;s face back to their 20&#x27;s.  However, they do point out Redeaux leaves most of the ingredients out, so somewhat of a mystique.  What we noticed is the finishes are different, Wrinkle Redeaux is the clear winner for dazzling perfect pH looking skin, takes up to 20 years off your face, while Oxytokin is a close 2nd with a different finish that lasts as long as Redeaux, just doesn&#x27;t have that knock out dazzling perfect young skin, but it DOES have one down, so dazzling perfect skin just one level down with Redeaux a perfect 10 and Oxytokin a perfect 9.  As I said I&#x27;m a guy and we just want quality looking skin as we get older.  Only other tidbit is try Loreal Revitalift x3 strength Eye Lift cream in the long red tube with DermaSilk&#x27;s 90 Second Eye Lift do them one after the other and the damn thing takes every crease and wrinkle out and completely removes the puffiness below the eyes to the point it&#x27;s astonishing, too many pinch marks with just the 90 Second, but with Revitalift it&#x27;s almost perfect.  You can follow that up with a second application of the 90 Second, don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s obvious what you can and can&#x27;t do but well worth your while to add to your routine.  Lasts all day and you can dab a little zit stick for guys or makeup for girls and then lightly blend it in by patting with your finger tip if you have any red marks, most have them on the inside next to the nose.  Peace!</li>
    <li> Hate this cream.  It made my face and head feel really weird.  I must have been allergic to one or two of the ingredients.  Never used it again, just sitting in my medicine cabinet.  Bought it because it was reccommended on line.  Don&#x27;t buy, there are other creams that would probably work better.</li>
    <li> Let me start by stating that I have not actually used this product on my skin.  I received this product through another website and sent it right back after reading the ingredient list which has many questionable ingredients not listed on the webpage, including parabens that are known carcinogens (check out the EWG&#x27;s Skin   Deep Database and Safe Cosmetics Campaign).  Save your money for a product that has the good stuff in it, which may be more expensive, but worth using on your skin.  Another case of \\&quot;if a deal seems to good to be true, that&#x27;s because it probably is\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I too was excited to hear the product reviews in relation to cost.  I was disappointed BEFORE I actually even got the product because AFTER I purchased but BEFORE I had actually received the product, I received so many emails from the company wanting me to buy \\&quot;bigger and better\\&quot; products.  The sales pitch was something like \\&quot;If your serious about eliminating wrinkles and signs of aging...you need to buy...\\&quot;.  The company had no confidence in their product, so therefore, how could I?   I received so many emails I had to unsubscribe and was disillusioned with the product before I even had a chance to receive and use it.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money.  Used it for two months and absolutely no difference.  Purchased ROC moisturizer and saw remarkable in all lines and wrinkles and a much firmer face in three weeks.</li>
    <li> Never mind the reviews from the under 40 crowd.  It&#x27;s the review from the over 65 girls that you should pay attention to.  This cream, used along with a serum, is great.  It absorbs into your skin immediately and after time, you will notice the difference in your face.  This order is for a dear friend who I hope has the same great results I have had.</li>
    <li> I have used the whole jar morning and evening and I have not noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;My face is still dry feeling after it has soaked into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I think also that you get more jar than you do actual product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just didn&#x27;t use it long enough, but so far, I&#x27;m not very impressed.</li>
