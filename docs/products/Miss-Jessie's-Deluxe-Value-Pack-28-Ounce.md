<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> a gift for a friend but i hear great things about this product line</li>
    <li> Based on the view, it appears that there are only 7 products, but this package includes all of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products. Way more than I anticipated! This gives me a chance to try all of the line without a huge monetary commitment. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a sad note, R.I.P. to the co-founder of this brand, Titi Branch. Prayers to her family.</li>
    <li> I bought this, because I wanted to try Miss Jessie&#x27;s products but didnt know which to try.  I&#x27;ve used the curly meringue and it was ok.  For the price of these I expected more.  I will use what I have, but I will not repurchase unless the price goes down</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift  for my boyfriend&#x27;s mother . She loved it !!!!!The samples are cool!</li>
    <li> fiance loves this so much, spearmint smell is the best</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS HANDS DOWN FOR NATURAL HAIR.  I LIKE TO GIVE MY HAIR A REST IN THE SUMMER MONTHS SO I USUALLY WASH, CONDITION &amp; AIR DRY.  THIS PRODUCT LEAVES MY HAIR NICE AND SOFT AND WITH A NICE SHINE.  MY DAUGHTERS HAIR IS TOTALLY NATURAL ALL YEAR ROUND AND THIS IS ALSO HER FAVORITE.  ITS A LITTLE PRICEY BUT IT IS WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> Really pricey for sample sized jars but it&#x27;s a great way to try out their line. I have natural fine, tightly coiled cottony hair that tends to be tangly and dry with 75% shrinkage. The super sudsy shampoo was scary drying to my hair will never use that again. The cream shampoo and conditioners are ok. The buttercremes are awesom for dry twists, braids and braid&amp;twist outs. Leaves hair shiny soft and fragrant. Treatments are nice and curly pudding is ok for wet twists/ twistouts. I like it over all but nothing I would pay that much for. Maybe the baby butter cream. That&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
    <li> I liked a few of the products and my hair has been natural for almost two yrs. If you wanna purchase this to try out the Miss Jessie line..good. I still think a few of these can be found cheaper at a well-stocked beauty supply store. Good Luck</li>
    <li> I bought this sample package last month because i decided to grow out my natural hair. My hair is kinky curl ( type 4b) and super thick. I wanted to see what the \\&quot;hair- hype\\&quot; was about  with these products and i was pleasantly surprised. I love the super slip shampoo it softens and detangles my hair in no time. I also love the quick curls, curly pudding and baby butercreme, especially as it contains peppermint oil,my scalp feels really good and my hair drinks in the stuff too. I have tried almost every one of the products liking some more than others, simply because of how my hair responds to the product. All in all i have gotten really good results thus far and plan on purchasing the products that work for my hair in larger amounts.</li>
    <li> Good product thought it was all Natural and it&#x27;s definitely not</li>
    <li> good way to try all the products without spending a ton on items you may not like.</li>
    <li> Nice! exactly what I expected... although the products aren&#x27;t up to the price they cost quality-wise (they damaged my hair pretty badly)... But atleast I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
    <li> I was glad to see the sizes were enough for a few uses. The sweetback conditioner made my hair feel and smell divine. The slippery shampoo and quick curls did so well that I immediately ordered full sized bottles. I haven&#x27;t use the other items yet but I plan to. The only thing is, I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair and that seems to be recommended.</li>
    <li> Great way to test all the different kinds at once so that you can then invest in a big jar of the product you prefer! Good job!! Gave it to my mom for Christmas and she loved it!!</li>
    <li> Gr8 deal for a variety of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:bf3f5fdb4bd4ddfece7315f19aaf42]](Sorry about the crappy video quality... Somehow Amazon screwed that up. I have a clearer video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;LFaqmjKl06c )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been a die-hard Miss Jessie&#x27;s fan based off of the shampoo and conditioner for a while, now. I&#x27;ve avoided the other products because of the price and uncertainty. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20-$30 on a single product if  I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure I&#x27;d love it. Well, this little package lets me test everything without having to spend hundreds of dollars for it. It came with MCUH more than I expected it to come with, honestly. I thought it was only the jars that are showcased in the picture, but there&#x27;s SO much more in there. It was a great surprise to see all the product samples packed in there.  Now I can test for what does and does not work for my crown. ♥ Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be on my way to buying more full sized bottles, next!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas off of her Amazon wishlist. Needless to say I was highly disappointed when I opened the box and saw these sample size containers of the product. What a hustle. I almost feel like I should fill out a police report, cause I got robbed. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried four of the products thus far, but I ordered two of the four.</li>
    <li> This sample pack is a great investment and option for anyone with natural hair or considering going natural that does not know which products to use. I have very thick hair that goes down past my shoulder blades, each sample was good for at least a few uses. These products are relatively expensive and it is best to find which will work for your hair type and desired look before you pay full price for them. I would suggest this to anyone experimenting on what to use. The products are high quality and I found several in the pack that work well with my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product and so do my curls!</li>
    <li> Some of the sample are a little small but overall I was very happy with this order. It allows you to test the products and determine what works best for you. Like all Miss Jessie&#x27;s products it is a little expensive but I am happy with the results and now I know what I will and will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Best deal and price ever for Miss Jessie&#x27;s! Love the packaging and selections of product.</li>
    <li> Bundle pack is value and provides a great opportunity to try each of the products to determine which products works best for your hair.</li>
    <li> I went natural and wanted to try out which products were going to work for my hair.  This is a great sampler in that it gives you a variety of products however the products did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff !!! I use these product in my 2 year old and got his Hair looking nice and curly</li>
    <li> I am happy to have purchase this package because I was able to find a product among it that works with my hair.</li>
    <li> Still trying to decide which product is best for my needs.</li>
    <li> It was ok to try all of the products, but most were so similar I would have rather bought a couple of large sizes for about the same money. They probably should have put some coupons with this product since sizes were so small.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair (not kinky/coily/wavy) and found that most of the products in Miss Jessie&#x27;s package were geared at more kinky/coily hairs. The shampoo left my hair feeling like it had a weird layer on it, the leave-in smelled funny, and I really disliked the co-wash (I rewashed my hair after trying it). The curl recovery (in the brown tub) was very effective though. My hair felt rejuvenated and soft after use. However, there are other products I have had better luck with. I also tried the Pillow Soft Curls, which actually made my hair smell like a dryer sheet (not bad, not crazy about it either though). I really liked it at first, but my hair got greasy and limp towards the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I absolutely LOVED about Miss Jessie&#x27;s value pack was the Quick Curls. It did it&#x27;s job very well and held my curls. Not to mention the smell! So amazing! Sort of a lemongrass-ginger smell. This one will stay in my routine. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This was a great package to help my daughter figure out which of these items would work best for her hair type. Great job and tracking it was very good and on time.Thanks</li>
    <li> Thank God for sample siZes.  I haven&#x27;t tried all of them but as of now the results of the ones I have tried are not impressive.  Must of them give me a great look when wet but when dry, they leave my hair hard and with lots of frizz and more shrinkage then if I simply leave in a bit of my conditioner.  If you&#x27;ve looked at their products and can&#x27;t commit to one, buy them all by way of the sample pack.  By the way I want to give the seller props.  It&#x27;s nice when you get a gift with purchase plus it arrived   quickly.  Great customer service is a rare commodity these days, so thank you Aveyou Beauty Boutique!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but for this product I felt I needed to share my purchase experience. When I read some of the reviews it was mentioned that these products are geared more for African American hair. I am Caucasian with natural thick wavy long hair. It became such an effort to style.  I could  NOT get a comb through my hair with out globs and globs of conditioner and still it&#x27;s an effort. My hair got tangled and knotted underneath towards my scalp. I have searched, spent countless amounts of money on hair products high end and low end. NOTHING  has worked ever like Miss Jessie&#x27;s. The first time I used the packet of detangling shampoo,(YES! I did type shampoo) I instantly found what I had been searching for. Not only does it work but it smells magnificent. My hair just looks amazing and it&#x27;s such a joy to finally be able to really do my hair in so many ways now. I now have bought bottles of and jars of most of the items in this gift pack. Which was a great way to sample. I will keep coming back for morel. THANK YOU MISS JESSIE</li>
    <li> Great for transitioning to natural hair. Keep hair moisturized ,and soft. Not to greasy all natural chemical free. Delicate for kids too.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that this value pack is a great gift idea.  It&#x27;s a great way to get the Miss Jessie&#x27;s experience without going broke.  The 2 oz jars are the perfect trial size, providing you with enough product to get a few uses (about 3 for me, as far as stylers go and longer for the butters).  The products smell nice and I have gotten good performance from them.  The butters nourish and moisturize and make your hair smell delicious, also the butters provide shine, which I appreciate because my hair is curly and doesn&#x27;t reflect a lot of shine.  I&#x27;m in love with the butters.  Shampoo is good so is the conditioner (I&#x27;ve done a separate review on each), the two deep conditioners are fantabulous and I have purchased the larger jars.  My hair feels quite nice after deep conditioning treatments, soft and moisturized. (See my separate review for the Sweetback treatment).    The stylers are better than I expected.  Quick curls provides nice definition and softness, no greasies.  I&#x27;m passionate about the curly meringue, right now.  It provides definition and hold.  Love it and I purchased larger sizes on both of these awesome products.  Both curly puddings (scented and unscented) are awesome and do what they promise, but you must apply as suggested and if you&#x27;re really looking for poppin&#x27; curls, your hair has to be curly to begin with.  However, if you don&#x27;t possess a single curl, these stylers provide you with texture and using the right technique you can obtain a proper set.      For my hair these products live up to the \\&quot;hype\\&quot; and most of the products are worth the $$$ for me because of quality of preparation, ingredients and I liked the performance results.</li>
    <li> This set was amazing especially for the cost. I love Miss Jessie&#x27;s products but never can quite figure out which product of theres I like most. With this set I can finally try and have everything.  I have the best wash n gos with their products and I&#x27;ve tried sooooo many different products but my hair loves these.  My curls are more defined and softer. I am going to by more!</li>
    <li> Order came six days earlier than anticipated which was great. The samples are the perfect size. Good for about two uses</li>
    <li> This is a great convenient way to try all of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products without having to purchase full size.</li>
    <li> Has a great variety of what i needed and wanted.</li>
    <li> Such a great sampler to find out which products work best for you. I also travel a lot and the 2 oz sizes are perfect for my carry-on bag. I&#x27;ll probably refill the containers with full-size Miss Jessie&#x27;s moving forward, so I personally love the sizes. At first glance, it seems like you are paying a lot for a small amount of product, but I disagree if you are trying to find out what works for your hair. It isn&#x27;t easy finding great products for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Seller was prompt and the price was pricey and for the price i expected to get all my product the seller left out the quick curls tube and i would like to receive it as much as i payed for the sample pack other than that it did give me curls but i dont like my hair been dry,,,</li>
    <li> Nice large samples.  I would like to have had larger samples of the shampoo &amp; conditioner  (they were large packets).  My hair isn&#x27;t super kinky curly so i did have to give some items to a friend but she was happy.  I&#x27;ve liked everything I&#x27;ve tried so far.  I did feel like the leave-in conditioner was a little too lemony smelling for my taste but still worked well. The transition cream is amazing!</li>
    <li> This was a great package to help me figure out which of these items would work best for my hair type.  Great job.</li>
    <li> A little of everything! Great for the new naturalist.</li>
    <li> Good way to try the products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen so many reviews on theses products and I don&#x27;t see what the hype is all about the deep treatments do nothing even with heat! The products are okay but for the price of these products I personally think they are a waist of money I have 3b natural hair no chemicals.</li>
    <li> I bought this value pack because over the summer I tried the butter cream and I loved it so much that I wanted to see what else was out there. OMG this thing came jammed packed with stuff! I had so many products in there that I gave some away. I loved that they included a hair guide I used this to select the products that would work for me and my friends. I&#x27;m having so much fun playing with all the products and a few have become must haves. This is a fantastic way to experience miss jessies</li>
    <li> I loovveee miss jessies</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product but glad that this sampler package exists. Now I can avoid wasting $36 per tub of worthless product. Did nothing spectacular for my hair, better off using the other affordable brands for natural hair at Target. Like Kinky Curly, love that stuff!</li>
    <li> the products didn&#x27;t make my hair heavy and flat and I didn&#x27;t need to use a lot to see results. I will recommend this to my friends</li>
    <li> If you are wonderingif this is good for nautral hair. I recommend it! I dont use it becuase i am not natural YET but my mom is and she hadnt heard of this product. I brought it for her because i wanted her to do something diffrent with her hair instead of braids She tried this and loved the effect! She was like &#x27; i got good hair&amp;#34; (typical response) lol.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it and i hope you love it!</li>
    <li> Tried the sample pack I love it!  I cut my curly wavey frizzy hair into a short crop, my hair is curly in the back and sides wavey frizzy in the top so trying to find the right formula can be expensive.  People who complain about the price should go to a beauty supply store and price one small sample jar...its $12.00!  So getting 6 jars a tube and 3 generous packets for&lt;br /&gt;$50 is awesome.  Cultivating naturally curly hair is expensive you try so many products before you get the right formula.  FYI these products are geared towards mixed and african american hair types and textures so try the one that best suits your hair for less than a large sixe of one of the creams.  It is so worth it!  I got my pack in February I still have product.</li>
    <li> Miss Jessies had a great idea in providing a sample pack so you can decide what you actually like before you purchase the bigger sizes my only complaint is paying $66 for such small samples. One perk though was the trial sizes were also included in the sample pack so I was able to try more products than what was offered in the variety pack</li>
    <li> This is a good way to test the product line.  Unfortunately that test resulted in my decision not to purchase the larger size products.  Glad I was able to sample this without a huge cash outlay.  My hair is very short and this is designed to create curls which is not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I am pleased that Miss Jessie&#x27;s had a trail size of their products. It alows me to try the other products from the line then the ones I&#x27;ve used. I have  the cleansing shampoo, conditioner, and quick curls. I really love those, however,  it&#x27;s a little pricey and made me apprehinsive on trying something different and if it didn&#x27;t work, I would have felt like I wasted my money. I was surprised on all the other sample packs that came in the package.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great way to get to know about each product she offers to see what works for the texture of your hair.I purchased this for my wife and she loves it. Her hair looks lovely,many beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my biracial daughter(22) she really like the variety of nice sized products to try. She has not tried them all yet, but likes the ones she has tried.</li>
    <li> I love the different trials. I was able to see how each product worked on my hair.</li>
