<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far I am really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been using it for two weeks and can see and feel a definite difference in my skin and hair.  I recommend this oil for all the ways you can use it.  I will continue to purchase Young for Life and tell everyone how well it works.</li>
    <li> I love this product It works great on conditioning Hair and Skin</li>
    <li> MY HANDS AND LEGS TEND TO GET EXTREMELY DRY DURING THE WINTER.  THIS OIL IS WONDERFUL!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for 2 years-I saw it on one the home shopping channels &amp; it was eally expensive.  They did go into great detail on the benefits.  You can use a little bit-that&#x27;s all you need-on your hair &amp; cuticles and on your neck &amp; face.  I like that it is 100 % Argan Oil &amp; that it comes in a brown bottle!  Great Product!</li>
    <li> Make my hair soft! And silky!</li>
    <li> tried it for the $1 facebook quick deal, got it very fast and it is not greasy, I think it&#x27;s going to help &amp;#34;the rough spots of age&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> NICE.....Absorbs well. Goes on smooth...</li>
    <li> I love Argan oil in the winter.  It&#x27;s wonderful for deep moisturizing at night.</li>
    <li> Great product, really pleased with the performance of it.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, makes your skin soft and healthy looking</li>
    <li> Purchased at discount for resting and it certainly passes.  I have gray coarse hair and I uae this to tame it,</li>
    <li> good stuff! very happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I started using Argan Oil!  I use it on my hair, face, hands, cuticles and also add to my lotion.  It resides in my purse most of the time because I certainly do not want to be without my oil. It is rather addictive.  Argan Oil will definitely always be in my possession!</li>
    <li> With the harsh sun and the various chemicals from the swimming pool my hair looked very dry and brittle this summer!  I received a sample and tried it out on my hair and it was simply AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant believe how great this product is...I used it twice and my hair feels and looks great and it has even got its shine back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for an excellent product!  I will definitely use it in the future!</li>
    <li> This particular oil was recommended to me by a friend as i was suffering from hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I used lots of different products in the past and spent a lot of money and none of them worked.&lt;br /&gt;After using this particular product for a relatively short time i could see results.&lt;br /&gt;This was very exciting as it was the first product to show results.&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this product is, its natural and contains no chemicals. its safe to use, has a soft feel, smells clean and certainly is beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommended this product to anyone with the same problem as it really does work!</li>
    <li> very very nice product moisturizing, leaves skin soft but not greasy..a must have for beauty routine I finally have a product for all skin uses</li>
    <li> Love this argan oil. Use in baths, face, feet, hands anywhere that needs a little help. Would buy again, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> All I need is a few drops in my hand to keep my hands moisturized or to rub into the ends of my hair to keep my hair frizz free and fabulous looking!  And bonus, it has a very light scent, not overpowering at all like some essential oils!  A winner!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine suggested Argan Oil. This is a very good product with fair prices.  Will buy again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old with dry skin and hair. Over the years I have used many different products to hydrate my hair and skin. I have always been disappointed, and felt like I wasted my money. This product is a miracle for me. My hair is shiny and feels so soft and manageable. For the first time in my life my skin feels hydrated. The results were quick and the oil is so luxurious feeling. This is a great quality product and I honestly will use it as the base for my beauty regimen. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Argan Oil and I use it regularly.  This is an unbelievably fabulous value for the price - honestly - go out and price for yourself how much 2 oz. of 100% Argan Oil would cost and you won&#x27;t come anywhere near the inexpensive price of Young for Life.  This is a product that you should definitely stock up on...NOW!!!  Argan Oil is a bit of a miracle oil, in my opinion.  You can use it literally anywhere on your body - skin, eyes, lips, cuticles, rough patches, hair, etc.  A little goes a long way.  Once applied, your skin will absorb it quickly and after about a minute, your skin will be dry.  It is as if your skin just wants to drink in Argan Oil.  It is amazing.  Get this, use it, and you will love it!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product countless times, given as gifts, and have recommended to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I use this product as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;She has sensitive skin and has not had any complications.&lt;br /&gt;I am middle age and have been very happy with the absence of fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great facial moisturizer and product I can use on my hair too.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great organic oil as it contains Essential Fatty Acids that are great anti-oxidants that can prevent aging.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and the fact that it is organic.&lt;br /&gt;A great quality product at an even better price.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and I always deal with chemicals that make it itchy and this helps a lot soothing my skin. I love how it is not greasy and my skin feels soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product. it absorbs easily, even on sensitive skin.  I would definitevely recomended to other.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and super quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to help me reduce the dehydration of my hair, and thus far It has. Can you say silk finish, Wow this is my first of many purchases of this essential oil. Because I have dreadlock my hair always needs more oil. However with the purchase of Organic Argan Oil I only need roughly 6 to 8 drops to have my locks feeling silky smooth. I use this item in conjunction with: Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and for shampoo, I use Terressential pure earth hair wash, the Lavender garden pure earth hair wash and also add to it Premium Quality Lavender Essential Oil, sold by Naturily Healthy, to get a more relax pleasant aroma. It gives my hair a wonder clean finish and my locks feel especially,cleaner, softer, with a silk all around finish and smells delightful. I am very pleased with my purchase and would buy more in the future.    Update: I just purchased two more and aim to buy more in the coming future.</li>

    <li> I add a few drops of Argan oil to ends of my hair before blow drying, seemed to hydrate/moisturize the hair &amp; keep it from appearing dry. I&#x27;ve also used a few drops after the hair is dry: adds a little shine. Best of all it&#x27;s 100% pure organic oil: paraben free, fragrance free, colorant free &amp; no preservatives.</li>

    <li> Awesome product! I will most definetly be purchasing more!&lt;br /&gt;Update:3/18/2015&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is truly amazing! My fiance unfortunately is in the process of having a Bone Marrow transplant and because his immune system is down he developed psoriasis on his elbow and hands.His oncologist wanted him to use steroids and we tried this Argan oil instead. The psoriasis was completely gone in 2 days! His Dr couldn&#x27;t even believe it! Thank you so much for making such an awesome product!!</li>
    <li> I love this Argan Oil!  I have been using it daily on my cuticles and my face...  I use it n my scalp the night before I shampoo and sleep all night with it...  I just think it&#x27;s the best!  I especially love using it on my face...  I really is a good moisturizer to apply after cleaning...  Rapidly absorbs into skin and gives my skin a lovely glow...

    <li> Really like theargan oil, my skinand hair is on the dry side, can tell a difference in skin after using for a week, hair seems to have more shine than before, would buy this product again, thanks for the offer</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Excellent item that arrived rapidly and very well packaged. I&#x27;ve only been&lt;br /&gt;using the oil for a few days and I can already see improvement in nail strength.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I really like this argan oil as it is so easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have an over-powering smell. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is that the dropper is not effective. The oil leaks out of it without any pressure at all. Knowing that, I&#x27;ve just adjusted how I use it. Hope it can restore the moisture my skin&#x27;s been missing all winter~Arrived exactly when promised, in perfect condition, and is easily becoming one of my favorite products!!</li>
