      <li>/&gt;It is easy for her to use.</li>
      <li>This bike is wonderful for strengthening leg/arm muscles while you&#x27;re sitting down.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;it should be fine.</li>
      <li>It also is so light weight it flips over easily.</li>
      <li>It is light weight and carrys well.</li>
      <li>This Restorator Bike has been fantastic in helping me gain strength and mobility after injury to my arm</li>
      <li>Not all models have these important features.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone that needs to do light workouts at home.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they would fit over anyone&#x27;s feet, not even a child&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>It has proven to be the most useful part of my home therapy.  </li>
      <li>It does not take up much space and very easy to take as you travel.</li>
      <li>Not user friendly.  </li>
      <li>Whomever is responsible for  shipping out merchandise at Amazon needs to be aware of this and take care to see that products that are paid for will arrive in the best condition possible.  </li>
      <li>It meets my needs of being compact, easy to use, easy to assemble and very affordable.</li>
      <li>a great way to exercise while sitting down and watching tv or listening to music or just watching nature.</li>
      <li>great little exercizer</li>
      <li>I bought this item for my 85 year old father in law fresh out of skilled rehab in a nursing home.  </li>
      <li>particular Bike has ability to change the resistance, and also keeps an accurate count of the number of rotations performed.</li>
      <li>It is light weight enough to move easily It does seem to move some when in use.</li>
      <li>great for those needing to rehabilitate their legs but not able to go out to walk.  </li>
      <li>I like this bike very much.  </li>
      <li>Well made and exactly what my wife and I needed.</li>
      <li>Exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
      <li>The cylinder under the tension adjustment gets hot.  </li>
      <li>well worth the money--built a lot better than expected</li>
      <li>all ok but need to aadjust the way one employs stirrups (mainly to override the use of the stirrups for hands and us stirrups only for feet</li>
      <li>little warm to the touch.</li>
      <li>A little wobbly when using, would have prefered a kind of suction legs.</li>
      <li>Really helpful exercising my shoulder after rotator cuff surgery.</li>
      <li>Thanks  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t pedal very long, about 10 minutes with light tension and it gets</li>
      <li>love this little pedal bike</li>
      <li>It does take up quite a bit of space in my trunk, but honestly, for the price it has worked very well over the last few years.</li>
      <li>When I assembled it, there was no way to stabilize it, so that it rocked from left to right while I was trying to ride it forward.</li>
      <li>It is exactly as pictured and was recommended by my Mom&#x27;s physical therapist.</li>
      <li>I have ashort leg fram,e,and thought I&#x27;d have to send ib, but my boy cut thelags down to fit</li>
      <li>Maybe changing this hard plastic strap to a bungee cord type of strap it would actually be able to hold a foot in place.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my 88 year old Mother who has mobility problems.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After much hassling about the mistake finally was refunded purchase price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually getting function in my right hand back</li>
      <li>Lots of adjustment can be made from very easy to very hard on the tensioner.</li>
      <li>Foot pedals and loops are too small, and don&#x27;t hold one&#x27;s feet securely.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use, but the resistance is difficult to monitor and maintain consistently.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly the tension knob would not screw in far enough to work.</li>
      <li>I ordered a restorator bike for arms and legs and what I got was a cheep imitation of the real thing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Broke my leg couldnt walk but had to excercise for health problems work out well</li>
    <li> Well made and exactly what my wife and I needed. Great While watching TV</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for.  For an elderly man who needs to exercise but can not ambulate well....Thanks  we will order again</li>
    <li> My Dad&#x27;s Occupational Therapist suggested he get one of these, so we ordered this.  What a neat piece of equipment.  Lightweight and can be used for arms and legs strengthening.  Delivery was quick and product is very good.</li>
    <li> Item wasn&#x27;t level.  Had to place a shim under one leg.</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose for now</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> well worth the money--built a lot better than expected</li>
    <li> The physical therapist recommended this, and we bought it.  It works well, although the feet pedals are fairly small, and my husband has to take his shoes off to use it.  This can also be used for the arms, which is good.</li>
    <li> very happy with this purchase. great product would recomand to anyone needing a product like this. great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Perfect for leg and arm warm up</li>
    <li> Good item for elderly parent to sit and exercise legs and arms, but there is no suction so the bike moves as cycle movement is going on</li>
    <li> When it arrived, one of the straps on the pedal was broken.  Apparently, it had not been packaged securely enough because this should not have happened.  Whomever is responsible for  shipping out merchandise at Amazon needs to be aware of this and take care to see that products that are paid for will arrive in the best condition possible.  In the meantime, I will need to glue the strap so that it does not come undone.  Otherwise, it can&#x27;t be used.  I hope that this is not typical of Amazon&#x27;s products because otherwise I won&#x27;t be ordering any other items out of concern for the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> A little wobbly. Not as sturdy as I&#x27;d hoped.  Still usable</li>
    <li> I purchased this little bicycle at the behest of my physical therapist. Due to my multiple medical issues, it is next to impossible for me to exercise. This bike is wonderful for strengthening leg/arm muscles while you&#x27;re sitting down. If you are thinking of buying this, don&#x27;t hesitate. The price is great, but your results will be even greater!</li>
    <li> Just like the other reviews said  this thing is shaking when you work out. I would not buy it again. Good concept not will made.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 88 year old Mother who has mobility problems.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy for her to use. She says she feels better after her &amp;#34;work out&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Never received ordered item.  Was sent a different, less expensive one and rejected it.  After much hassling about the mistake finally was refunded purchase price.  Still need the medically recommended item so will have to find another source. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered a restorator bike for arms and legs and what I got was a cheep imitation of the real thing.  It cost me $12.00 in postage to return it and the company charged me a restocking fee on top of all of that.  Definitely not a positive experience.</li>
    <li> Foot pedals and loops are too small, and don&#x27;t hold one&#x27;s feet securely.  The unit bounces around when trying to use it.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> very well made &amp; versitile - a great value</li>
    <li> This Restorator Bike has been fantastic in helping me gain strength and mobility after injury to my arm and shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;This particular Bike has ability to change the resistance, and also keeps an accurate count of the number of rotations performed. Not all models have these important features.</li>
    <li> excellent, love doing my exercises with it, and quite useful for the arms and legs, I recommend doing the exercises in the morning, I prefer my day gets better.</li>
    <li> This item was of such poor quality that it was broken when it arrived. When I assembled it, there was no way to stabilize it, so that it rocked from left to right while I was trying to ride it forward. My trainer told me I could harm myself if I used it.  The only good news was that they were great about refunding my money.</li>
    <li> at home exercise to build up my muscles post hip replacement .Easy to use does like to walk so brace it against a beam on the porch and pump away</li>
    <li> Perfect for continual therapy after my knee replacement.</li>
    <li> bought this item for wife rehab.piece of junk wanted 13.00 to return i tried to use it ,flopped all over the place . tryng to pedal ,it was like catching a leaking ballon with boxing gloves on. still trying to get amazon to get my refund</li>
    <li> Doing physical therapy for knee and needed this for work outs. Have to have up against a wall or table as travels.  Is wabbley. That being said it was inexpensive and you get what you pay for. It works.</li>
    <li> IT WORK&#x27;S GREAT ON MY LEGS , WHEN I&#x27;M STUCK INSIDE</li>
    <li> Suitable tension for arms, but not for legs. It is like no tension at all. It also slides al over the floor - carpeting or tile.</li>
    <li> Delivery of a well described and packaged device was the best.the unit is strong yet easy to work. Great addition to the rehab equipment at a very fair price.</li>
    <li> Wobbles, scoots away from me while pedaling, and isn&#x27;t a smooth movement, kind of jerky.</li>
    <li> The machine works fine !!  When my leg muscle began to heal, I didn&#x27;t need the machine and more.  So the excercise was helpful</li>
    <li> I put mine on a card table in front of the TV.  It walks a little, but that only requires an occasional re-adjustment.  Or I could tape stops onto the card table to prevent the walking.  I don&#x27;t expect to use it for legs, but I&#x27;m delighted with the effect on my arms and shoulders. It came almost entirely assembled.  The tension adjustment knob was separate and I had to attach it.  Easily done.  The cylinder under the tension adjustment gets hot.  Beware.</li>
    <li> Not as heavy duty as I expected.</li>
    <li> Too easy to use to burn many calories or work out. Needs some resistance to work properly. It also is so light weight it flips over easily. Maybe good for elderly people.</li>
    <li> Had to use it without the feet holders and my feet/shoes slipped on the pedals. Also, the device moved on the floor-would have required my putting weights on it to hold it in place. I asked to return it (got immediate refund from seller who told me not to bother returning it-I donated it to my PT gym).&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the tension knob would not screw in far enough to work. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> It does not stay in the place I put it.  Slipped across the room and does not make it easy to peddle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Cusimano</li>
    <li> A little wobbly when using, would have prefered a kind of suction legs. But managed, it works.</li>
    <li> Yeah, it met my expectations. It worked as well as everybody said. It wobbles, it does not fit under desk and it won&#x27;t stay in place. All it does is provide movement for my legs.</li>
    <li> Slips all over the tiles but works great on carpet.  Carpet is bad for handicap!</li>
    <li> I have ashort leg fram,e,and thought I&#x27;d have to send ib, but my boy cut thelags down to fit&lt;br /&gt;work very good.</li>
    <li> Works really well for knee replacement patient, my husband had both knees replaced, Restorator was excellent for limbering up!</li>
    <li> I gave four stars because the straps on the pedals are too short.  I don&#x27;t think they would fit over anyone&#x27;s feet, not even a child&#x27;s.  I believe they are supposed to hold the foot on the pedal.  Maybe changing this hard plastic strap to a bungee cord type of strap it would actually be able to hold a foot in place.  Replace these straps and five stars would not be out of the question.  I have not tried the bike on my arms but it works great for my legs.  Lots of adjustment can be made from very easy to very hard on the tensioner.</li>
    <li> love this little pedal bike it is wonderful. des a great job, unless I get going to fast and then the little feet turn. So I can&#x27;t do any racing, ha!</li>
    <li> Really helpful exercising my shoulder after rotator cuff surgery.</li>
    <li> I found it to be just what I neeeded.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Never worked correctly as it keeps slipping &amp; coming undone.</li>
    <li> My sister in law was advice by her cardiologist to use this stuff for her daily exercise, and she enjoys it.</li>
    <li> This is a great! Buy. It has strengthened my legs within a weeks time. I recommend it to anyone in need of leg and arm strength.</li>
    <li> great for those needing to rehabilitate their legs but not able to go out to walk.  Easy to put together.  Not overly priced for the equipment.  Only draw back is that you need to rest it against a wall or it walks away from you when you are peddling.  Was satisfied with what it did</li>
    <li> Could not use at all. Wear size 6M shoe and could not put my toes in. Built for&lt;br /&gt;child&#x27; foot.</li>
    <li> The Restorator is working out great for me, it has tension control for a better work out.  It&#x27;s portable I can use it anywhere in the house or take it outside and use it on the deck.  It works great on a table top and gives me a great workout.  I would recommend it over the costly exercise bike.  It literally takes up no space.  There was nothing not to like about the Restorator.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I can&#x27;t pedal very long, about 10 minutes with light tension and it gets&lt;br /&gt;a little warm to the touch. It wiggles at the joints a little.  But for someone with bad legs&lt;br /&gt;it should be fine.</li>
    <li> Not user friendly.  The restorator is difficult to pedal due to the fact that you can not keep your feet on the pedals</li>
    <li> This is a really good exercise wheel for legs or shoulder/arms. However, I ordered one and received three of the same item. I will be returning two but will need help as I am currently handicapped.</li>
    <li> I am using this for health issues to build up energy in my legs. It is light weight enough to move easily It does seem to move some when in use. Ihad to replace a clip on one of the pedal arms</li>
    <li> It  works good needs to be able to have ability to have more tension and  better rubber straps&lt;br /&gt;Then. It would be a 41/2 or 5</li>
    <li> We ordered this for my very ill husband, and since his death it has little or no use.  I plan to make use of it, but put it off.</li>
    <li> all ok but need to aadjust the way one employs stirrups (mainly to override the use of the stirrups for hands and us stirrups only for feet and even then not quite as satisfactory as it might be.&lt;br /&gt;also, need to put chair againts a sturdy table when pedalling to avoid chair falling backwards.</li>
    <li> Has been great for keeping knee loosened up during rehab at home for a reasonable price. Easy to use and lightweight.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will do and is affordable.</li>
    <li> Had a total knee replacement and this has worked great for my rehab!!!</li>
    <li> great little exercizer</li>
    <li> it  gives me the  muscle work out that I need</li>
    <li> I like this bike very much.  It meets my needs of being compact, easy to use, easy to assemble and very affordable.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my 85 year old father in law fresh out of skilled rehab in a nursing home.  He has used it for a long time.  Can use wither arms or legs.  For less mobile people this is a beneficial item.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as pictured and was recommended by my Mom&#x27;s physical therapist. I also wanted to use it for my arms since I have a shoulder impingement.</li>
    <li> This device was recommended by the physical therapist at the Rehab Center where I began working my new knee.  It has proven to be the most useful part of my home therapy.  I recommend it to anyone who has undergone total joint replacement in a knee.</li>
    <li> good exercise, indoors, safe.</li>
    <li> when using it on a table top for arms, it slides around a lot. It should have suction cups or be weighted.</li>
    <li> It works so well. I&#x27;m actually getting function in my right hand back 😄 I&#x27;m very pleased with this item. I love it and would recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s had a stroke 😏</li>
    <li> Working out at whereever and at any time it has help me. This purchase has provide me with opportunity to work out.</li>
    <li> I admit that I&#x27;m lazy. And I know I need to exercise my legs because of knee pain. This allows me to exercise my knees while sitting in a safe, comfortable chair. My only issue with this is that it is a tiny bit unstable if I move my legs to adjust my position in my chair without thinking.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my patients. It is light weight and carrys well. It is easy to use, but the resistance is difficult to monitor and maintain consistently. It does take up quite a bit of space in my trunk, but honestly, for the price it has worked very well over the last few years.</li>
    <li> I like it because it is so easy to move around and also easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone that needs to do light workouts at home. It does not take up much space and very easy to take as you travel. It does just what they said it would do. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This item was shipped with the product missing a critical part.  It won&#x27;t work without the tension knob.  The item is now worthless.</li>
    <li> My elderly Mo. in law has been using it to strengthen her legs this winter, because she doesn&#x27;t go out at all when the weather is bad.  Her leg strength and balance is better.</li>
    <li> My husband had a stroke several months ago.  It was suggested by his therapist that he use one of these to strengthen his arms.  It us hard to find a table at the right height.  We set it on the table and he has to stand in order to use it. We are hopeful that it will help.</li>
    <li> a great way to exercise while sitting down and watching tv or listening to music or just watching nature.</li>
