<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After googling it I thought that it is not possible to make my nightguard transparent and white again (it became yellow). However, this cleanser made my night guard looks like new in just 2 days.</li>
    <li> Another great product,works very well would buy again.</li>
    <li> It is ok works better then most! Still its not the one I was looking for,I had a liquid that work better then anything and can&#x27;t find it any more. They used to sell it at Wal Mart I can&#x27;t recall the name of it, but I guess it has a ingredient in it that they use to clean swimming pools.Maybe that is why they took it off the rack!</li>
    <li> Works very well, really the best product I have found.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional in its cleaning power. I will continue to use it. It&#x27;s a lot better than other cleaners and my teeth remain clean feeling all day.</li>
    <li> Although he soaked them every night in Polident,my husband&#x27;s dentures had significant tartar build up.  I bought StainAway yesterday on a pharmacist&#x27;s recommendation.  It&#x27;s incredible!  I was hoping that the tartar would gradually decrease. Overnight the tartar is completely gone &amp; his dentures look like new.  I&#x27;m thrilled to see that Amazon carries it so I don&#x27;t have to drive all over trying to find it next time.  StainAway not only does what it promises, it does even more.</li>
    <li> I order this on-line because I cannot always find it in the store.  It is supserior to Efferdent and Polident -they can only wish to do the cleaning job that Stain Away does.  My dad has had his dentures 53 years and after I bought the Stain Away, they cleaned up so much better that I now use the Polident tablets in the toilet between cleanings.  I drop one a day in the toilet and it helps keep it clean, but it did not clean the dentures like the Stain Away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband who has dentures.  I saw it at Wal-Mart and decided it was worth a try.  He loves it!  After trying it he refuses to go back to cleaning tablets.  I can&#x27;t find this item in the stores any more, so I was very pleased to find I could still get it online.</li>
    <li> It is the best product for denture cleaning!</li>
    <li> My husband is the one with all the dentures, and he&#x27;s grumbled now and again about how well one cleaner or another works for him.  This product, Stain Away Plus, satisfies him.  I also like it, because his dentures look very good.</li>
    <li> exactly as described and represented.</li>
    <li> This by far and away a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing dentures for over 10 years due to cancer. My dentures only looked this good when they were brand new!&lt;br /&gt;No brushing, no scrubbing, 30 minute soak and YAY! Ultra-Clean.&lt;br /&gt;There is no comparision at all, buy this stuff!</li>
    <li> The product cleans way better than Polident and such.  Don&#x27;t use too much of the product (I think that is what the person in the dentist&#x27;s review did, and that was the reason her denture lost color). Also, the solution can be reused once or even twice.  Great product, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works much better than the tablets. I bought for my elderly mother&#x27;s coffee stained dentures. No miracle but I do see much improvement.</li>
    <li> It removed stains that had been a concern for some time. I use it every other day overnight. I will order more.</li>
    <li> I used the common tablet  overnight soaking method for a few months until I run onto this, tried it and it was amazing the difference in the brightness, cleanliness and overall look of dentures left in Stain Away overnight.  Use a half-cap of the granules and cover with hot water.  In the morning you have completely stain-free, bright and clean dentures.  Amazing product.  Just ordered the four-pack.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, removes stains of every kind so far. I like blueberries, pecans, tea...All things it seems that stain. This takes the worry out of cleaning my dentures. The best thing that I have ever found.</li>
    <li> The best general cleaner I have found.&lt;br /&gt;If cost is a factor you will like this.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this on his dentures for years and there is nothing that works better particularly with an ultrasonic cleaner.  Stain Away is sometimes hard to find - our Wally World has dropped it -- but it&#x27;s well worth the search and I&#x27;m glad to see Amazon has it.   One note - the solution that results from mixing water and the powder will take the color out of clothing or makes ugly yellow spots so be careful where you lay your PJ&#x27;s, robes, etc.</li>
    <li> This product is as advertised.  Easy to use and very effective.  Removes stuborn stains left behind by brushing and using the powdered cleaners.</li>
    <li> The price was outrageous.  Thought I was ordering 4 for that price.</li>
    <li> This works faster and way better than the tablets.  I will buy again.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WORKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER SOAKS IN REMOVING ALL STAINS WITH JUST ONE SOAK.  I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN I COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT IN LOCAL STORES BUT AMAZON SAVED THE DAY.  IT IS THE BEST CLEANSER I HAVE EVER USED AND I HAVE HAD DENTURES FOR FIFTY YEARS</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement of a gel I could no longer find.  This hands down beats anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and with no mess.</li>
    <li> I tried StainAway Plus after reading the reviews on Amazon and talking with my doctor.  He strongly suggested that this not be used as a daily cleaner, but as needed and to follow the directions because he says it can change the color of the entire dentures.  I did follow the directions exactly with one capful and left the dentures to soak for 30 minutes, brushing with solution at the end of 30 minutes and rinsing.  To me they appeared as they did when I first got them (I have an extra set to compare them to).  I like tea and tea likes dentures and StainAway likes to get rid of stains!  I will keep using this as I was instructed and I would highly recommend it.    I did not buy this through Amazon, but at the grocery store for $4.98 plus tax.  I will, however, watch the price on Amazon and if I can get a deal, I will buy through Amazon.  Amazon has a physical presence in the state I live in and I would have to pay sales tax if purchased through Amazon, so the tax is a non-issue.    I think this is worth using.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a sample of this cleaner.  It was the only cleaner that has gotten rid of old wine stains.  I think it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> The rave reviews are true! I use this for a dental device and it cleans about 1000 times better than anything I&#x27;ve used from the drug store!</li>
    <li> This product works better then anything on the market</li>
    <li> Great whiting for dentures!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the product, removes stains very easily.</li>
    <li> Fast, best stuff on the market! Makes everything else useless. White and clean. Even my denist can&#x27;t believe how white and stain free my teeth are</li>
    <li> I AM A FERM BELEIVER OF THIS PRODUCT, I WAS TOLD ABOUTH THIS PRODUCT BY A FRIEND, AND IT HAS LIVED UP TO EVERYTHING SHE SAID IT WOULD DO.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dentures. I do have other things that need some deep cleaning. Retainers, mouth guards are an obviously choice and the Stainaway does a great job at cleaning in 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works great at cleaning stainless steel travel mugs with coffee stains. Put a cap full in, mix in some hot water and let it sit for 4-5 hours. Dump out the solution and use a bottle brush on the inside. It will be sparkling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some success with tea pots and other ceramic items but not as remarkably clean as the stainless.</li>
    <li> Works well, cleans better than the others we have tried. Arrived when promised!</li>
    <li> Best product ever.  Lasts much longer than it states on label instructions because for each soaking, I just shake in a very little bit.  I soak all night (though not necessary), but only use a very little in water and it does the job.  Play around with the amount.. you&#x27;ll be surprised how little it takes!</li>
    <li> my husband only uses this also and will not use any other brand.</li>
    <li> This works great!  It does just what it says, removes stains and plaque.  Simply follow the package directions and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I will order again and never use any other product!</li>
    <li> For a while I have used Denture tablets to clean my toilet once a week, with a deep clean once a month, and it works great. I thought this would be similar but it is not.  It leaves a blue ring in the bowl. Darn. I will use it up until it  is gone.</li>
    <li> Just a capful and its great...it cleans in  between the teeth on the dentures also...with the Ivaton Digital ultrasonic combined.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband. He said it was the best product he has found to clean his dentures.</li>
    <li> Best cleaner I ever tried.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  This has Polident and Efferdent beat  by a mile!  Makes your partials and dentures truly sparkling clean!  I have used this for a long time and by far, find this product the best!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Great price.</li>
    <li> We love Stain-Away.   It does a great job on our dentures.  Amazon is great to order from and shipping is prompt.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner. Hard to find in local stores</li>
    <li> Many people ask what the ingredients of Stain Away are.  Here is the list taken from the box:  Potassium Monopersulfate, Sodium Carbonate, Sodium Percarbonate, Sodium Bicarbonate, Citric Acid, Sulfamic Acid, Geropon, Peppermint, FD&amp;C Blue.  Lots of people have been asking about the ingredients so I hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> I use this for a partial which works great but I found that it also works wonders for cleaning jewelry.  Not only do the teeth come out without any stains and looking great but the jewelry comes out shining and sparkling like new!!!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product when it first came out in Wal-Mart.  It was the best stuff that I ever came across that actually make my dentures look like they came straight from the Dentist.  I was really amazed.  Of coarse I was very upset when Wal-Mart discontinued selling the product.  I was happy to find out that Amazon.com carried this product and I could continue to buy and use it.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It does an ok job, but really no better that over the counter products such as polident, which costs less.</li>
    <li> If you want your dentures to sparkle and feel great buy this and use it weekly. I use regular tabs in between but this works great.</li>
    <li> It makes your dentures look brand new. Takes no more than 10-15 minutes to work, or over night, try it!</li>
    <li> My sister turned me on to this stuff. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it but it&#x27;s the best out there! Very satisfied with this product. I would encourage anyone to buy several of these...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had a badly stained denture!  I was new to the world of \\&quot;denture\\&quot; - never wanted to go there -- but an injury to my front teeth made it an eventual necessity.  This product is very lovely and fresh, easy to use, delightful!  It has a wonderful, clean scent.  When I used it, however, I had not tried removing stains with the \\&quot;hefty methods\\&quot; (solutions of vinegar, bleach, continuous and vigorous brushing -- information received following internet searches).  I believe this product will be great used on relatively bright (not stained) dentures.  I was really up against it with stains when I tried this product, and likely nothing but the \\&quot;hefty methods\\&quot; to which I refer would have helped at that point.  In other words, I believe you have to be at a fair starting point -- not to the point of badly stained dentures -- when you evaluate these kinds of products.  Thus, I would be glad to update my review now that I am free of stains; I would use it and it may very well maintain a stain-free denture and keep it in a stain-free condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be glad to do that for two to four weeks, and will then update my review.</li>
    <li> Best denture cleaner on the market!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful denture whitener.</li>
    <li> fast service from seller...I believe I have made a purchase with this seller for the same thing before. It&#x27;s everything I wanted to be</li>
    <li> Have used it for quite sometime  I was glad to find it on amazon  there is no other  that works as well</li>
    <li> My dentist introduced me to Stain Away after replacing my dentures. That was two years ago and I&#x27;ve used the product every night. When I wash off the dentures in the morning they are clean -- no plaque residue that I need to brush off. I&#x27;ve tried other denture cleaners but without success. They lack the ability to deal with plaque buildup. Rather than buy Stain Away at the local drug store I&#x27;ve chosen to buy online where it&#x27;s cheaper with no shipping costs if I buy $25 worth (4-5 boxes)  [[ASIN:B000GGJCOS Stain Away Plus Denture Cleanser, Professional Strength]]F</li>
    <li> Works just as advertized. Much better than the tablets. Took out stains that the tablets wouldn&#x27;t overnight. I will buy this stuff instead of the tablets.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used for my teeth.  Very simple to use and does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> Just right..arrived on time....good for the money...thank you</li>
    <li> I have a partial flipper and there were some stains on it for a while. I could not get rid of them&lt;br /&gt;with any other denture cleaner. I used a brush, vinegar, soaked, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I poured one capfull of this unique powder STAIN AWAY into a cup of hot tap water,&lt;br /&gt;put my partial in and BAM!  After 20 minutes or so...Almost ALL the stains were gone.&lt;br /&gt;After using it now for a couple of weeks, I notice the entire partial is cleaner including the&lt;br /&gt;tooth looks like it was bleached.&lt;br /&gt;I highly 5 Stars Recommend Stain Away!!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!</li>
    <li> GETS MY DENTURES SPARKLY WHITE JUST AS IT ADVERTISES,I USE IT ONCE A WEEK,LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> Best denture cleaner I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I love this product for my dentures.  They not only look, but feel refreshingly clean each day because of using Stain Away.  My dentures are 4 years old already.  This is almost the ONLY product I&#x27;ve ever used for them and my dentures look as new as they did the day I came home with them.  I recommend Stain Away Plus Denture Cleanser, Professional Strength to ANYONE that wants their dentures to look as fresh and new as the day they first came home with you.  There is NO comparison between this product and any of the others on the market.  How do I know?  I bought one of each item when I first got my dentures and used each one once to test it out.  I found I liked Stain Away best from the first usage and threw the rest away.[[ASIN:B000GGJCOS Stain Away Plus Denture Cleanser, Professional Strength, 8.1 oz.]]</li>
    <li> This stuff cleans very well. And it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to work. I use it in between tablets.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to use it at first because there are no ingredients listed on the box; however, I just have to give it a try somehow.  I have stubborn stains on my Valplast denture due to drinking coffee.  After searching the internet, I bought this product at Raleys&#x27; grocery store in Northern California for less than $7. I highly recommend this product as it removed the stains on my Valplast even after first try.  It also feels clean in my mouth.  Great product indeed!</li>
    <li> The water in my area is very hard, and hard water deposits accumulate on everything that gets wet.  I always soaked my dentures in a denture bath overnight with one of those drop-in dissolving tablets, but my tongue started noticing a rough film on my dentures which made the surfaces feel gritty even after I&#x27;d just cleaned them.  It must have been hard water deposits.  Then I tried Stain Away, and voila!  After one use, the gritty film was completely gone and my dentures felt clean and polished!  Another thing I noticed is that whenever I ate a chocolate brownie and then cleaned my dentures overnight with the dissolving tablets, there would still be dark stains from the brownie the next morning.  Those stains also disappeared after one soaking in Stain Away!</li>
    <li> I have tried Many Denture products in the past , I am a smoker and nothing would take the tobacco stains off of my dentures. But let me tell you this Product REALLY works !!!  I am amazed my denture are over 30 years old and now they are like NEW again . Thank you STAIN AWAY .</li>
    <li> Really like this denture cleaner......works great.</li>
    <li> Mother uses this product 👍 it works great</li>
    <li> this is the best product to get your dentures white again!</li>
    <li> Best stain cleaning product I&#x27;ve found. It cleans when others don.t.</li>
    <li> I am concerned about persulfates that are present in denture soaks...........most of the brands list the ingredients and have warning about the persulfates which has caused many health concerns including death but I wonder why there is not an ingredient list for this stain away product.</li>
    <li> This is the best stain remover I have ever used. It is great in dentures, and removes smoke tar in seconds.  I would recommend this for anyone who has dentures or partials.</li>
    <li> I really like this denture cleanser over others that I have tried. It is quick, easy and does the trick. It leaves no bad tastes like the other cleanser similar to this.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get stains out of my denture for anything...until I found this.  Will NEVER use another product to clean my denture.</li>
    <li> i had this product before, then i moved and missed it because i was very satisfied with the results i got. so  i oredered again&lt;br /&gt;and i am glad i did because my dentures are clean again the way i like them.</li>
    <li> A 1/3 cap cleans my teeth in an over nite soak like new.</li>
    <li> My denture had stains in the back that my paste or tablets wouldn&#x27;t remove them. Even my dentist&#x27;s ultra sound cleaner wouldn&#x27;t remove them. Stain Away Plus removed it on the first use. I use it daily now.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and no longer can find it in stores.  It is an excellent product and any denture wearer would be pleased with the results</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says. Very easy to use and I will be ordering more. Better than anything in the stores.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t decided about how good a job it is doing. I didn&#x27;t remember about only  leaving partial dentures in for a short period of time&lt;br /&gt;which is more compicated</li>
    <li> Worked great, but wish there were tablets instead of measuring powder</li>
    <li> friend had dentures for years &amp; years... with barrels of coffee &amp; cigarettes daily--  started feeling self-conscious while everyone whitens their teeth to a spooky level!!!  no... dentures don&#x27;t glow in the dark...yet... but they look remarkably better using this along with regular cleaning, etc!</li>
    <li> If you have dentures, this is a must.  Toothpaste work okay, but this keeps everything white and natural looking. Buy it.</li>
    <li> better than anything out there for removing stains</li>
    <li> I went back to tablets for convenience on a trip and within a few days could see the white plaque on the dentures.  I&#x27;ve never had that problem with the StainAway powder.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. It cleans my dentures very well &amp; actually removed some plaque that had been impossible to remove previously! All in all, I am satisfied with Stain Away &amp; will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Works great after a few uses, my denture looks new again and the stains are gone.</li>
    <li> But I purchased these to clean the toilets after reading how effective denture cleansers are.  Wow.  It worked, and it worked better than just about anything I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  The next morning, I didn&#x27;t even have to scrub.  It sparkled.</li>
    <li> Great product, only one that really can remove stains. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> The product was for my mom and it really works she is very pleased with it. We can&#x27;t get it here in canada anymore.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for Amazon.  I need to keep this handy because I smoke...and I drink LOTS of coffee and tea.  I use this once or twice a week and am always pleased at its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> cleans beyond expectation combined with the CD-3800.</li>
    <li> It works in an hour unlike other products that require 24 hours/  Seems to remove coffee stains, tea stains and others</li>
    <li> Really works!  My dentures have never looked better.</li>
    <li> best cleaner on the market.  the effervescent tablets do not measure up to this.  This is a super denture cleaner, and it works so fast.  instills confidence that your oral hygiene is 100% effective.  Great product ar a great price.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well.  It does not state what the contents are which I find objectionable.  Easy to use, although measuring the amount is less than ideal using their cap.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY cleanser that gets the stains off my dentures!!! I&#x27;ve tried them all. I couldn&#x27;t live without it! Stains from tea,, coffee,smoke,wine,berries,etc.</li>
    <li> This stuff cleaned the tea stains from inside my stainless steel travel cup and thermos. They&#x27;re shiny silver inside and look like new again.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of doing what it was intended to do. They came well packaged.</li>
    <li> Stainaway is a very good product, 1/2 cap full usually gives a perfect smile. If well rinsed there is no aftertaste, I usually soak over nite but had excellent results within minutes also. Highly recommend this to any one who wants a great smile!!</li>
    <li> I use it all the time, but stores in our area stopped handling it. It cleans stains away the best that I have ever seen.</li>
    <li> It does a good job. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t have dentures so I can&#x27;t rate this as a denture cleaner... but I do have a white porcelain kitchen sink and had heard that denture cleaner could get the stains out.  Sure enough, this worked amazingly well and all of the coffee/food stains were gone and the sink was white and sparkling again.  Really glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist told me that their office uses Stain Away to clean dentures, retainers, mouth guards, etc.... So I bought some Stain Away instead of the denture cleaner that I was using to clean my retainer. This cleanser is so much better! It removes just about any kind of build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I just soak my retainer in warm water with the recommended amount of cleanser, rinse off, and brush with toothpaste. It&#x27;s important to clean with toothpaste otherwise the retainer can taste kind of bitter. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> this is the only denture cleaner that cleans well, and removes coffee stain on my dentures.  This is a repeat order</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! It works great, and I no longer have yellowed dentures, Traditional brands don&#x27;t come close.</li>
