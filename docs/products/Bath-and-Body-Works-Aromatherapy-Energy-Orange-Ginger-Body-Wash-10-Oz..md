      <li>I bought this on Amazon because it was more convenient for me to receive by mail in 2 days than to plan a 30 min drive to my nearest Bath and Body Works shop.  </li>
      <li>Having this again, also, reminds me of the lovely person who gave it to me.</li>
      <li>Strong, refreshing, makes you want to take a shower.  </li>
      <li>my husband is a huge fan of this stuff and better than the bath and body works price</li>
      <li>Orange Ginger is not to strong smelling.</li>
      <li>Orange Ginger body wash has a mild pleasant scent that reminds me of a high end spa.  </li>
      <li>Afterwards, I ordered something else on Amazon and decided to get one for myself to be eligable for free shipping.  </li>

      <li>Worth the price.  </li>
      <li>This popular body wash is occasionally sold out in this size at the Bath Body Works stores.  </li>
      <li>It smells like fresh oranges and ginger - not chemically at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>highly recommend this one!!</li>
      <li>Nanny thanks!  </li>
      <li>She is a massage therapist and is very particular about body washes and lotions.</li>
      <li>Very nice to clean up with although a bit difficult to rinse off.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It keeps skin nicely hydrated with a little glow</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the smell of this that much.</li>
      <li>Until now, I really didn&#x27;t give any thought to aromatherapy products and their specified purpose.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this wash - especially in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I really believe it gives me energy after I shower with it.</li>
      <li>but it is very close.</li>
      <li>The 10 oz size is very convenient.  </li>
      <li>I was not expecting that at *all* since most clear body washes are water/alcohol/fragrance and wash away instantly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for an overall fine job.</li>
      <li>I love that this body wash is not sweet smelling, at all.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the product.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend it to family and friends</li>
      <li>and it really makes me feel clear headed and relaxed.</li>
      <li>This came wrapped very carefully and quickly.</li>
      <li>There is enough smell to notice but not so much that it is overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Smells good - too expensive.</li>
      <li>It is light enough not to be intrusive to those at a distance yet long lasting for those who like getting close.</li>
      <li>What a simple and inexpensive way to treat yourself a little extra special each day!</li>
      <li>The fragrance lasts nicely, if you combine it with the body lotion, but you can use perfume without creating a weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This leaves absolutely no residue on your skin and just leaves you feeling very soft.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The wife loves it and I love the way her skin smells afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite body washes.  I have been ordering it for years and cannot get sick of it.  The smell of the orange and ginger are invigorating.  This leaves absolutely no residue on your skin and just leaves you feeling very soft.  Wish they would come out with a bubble bath or something just like this, to soak in.  Wouldn&#x27;t that be something..</li>
    <li> This review is for:&lt;br /&gt;Bath &amp; Body Works Aromatherapy Energy Orange Ginger Body Wash &amp; Foam Bath 10oz&lt;br /&gt;Sold by AMAZ123ON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little bit goes a long way. It is not a girly, perfume smell, though my girlfriend says she loves how it smells on me. She introduced me to it some time ago and I&#x27;ve been ordering through Amazon sellers ever since. She is a massage therapist and is very particular about body washes and lotions. It gets her stamp of approval and I like it, too!</li>
    <li> Smells good - too expensive.</li>
    <li> This  stuff SMELL FABULOUS!!!!! if you are tired of the berry scents, strawberry, raspberry then try this.  I&#x27;m not a morning person but this wakes me up. Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Very nice to clean up with although a bit difficult to rinse off.</li>
    <li> I love love this smell. Strong, refreshing, makes you want to take a shower.  It&#x27;s also concentrated and lathers well.</li>
    <li> I gave this as part of a present to my niece, who loves her &#x27;break-from-the-children&amp;#34; shower and she loves the smell.</li>
    <li> Lotta lather, great scent, reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This came wrapped very carefully and quickly. A little goes a long way with this line and I love, love, love the scent!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Superb packaging. Good price. Highly recommended for an overall fine job. Thank you.</li>
    <li> item arrived as expected.  smells terrific!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice body wash.  I bought one at Bath &amp; Body Works and gave it for a gift.  Afterwards, I ordered something else on Amazon and decided to get one for myself to be eligable for free shipping.  I have been surprised that it was a few $ cheaper than in the store.</li>
    <li> my husband is a huge fan of this stuff and better than the bath and body works price</li>
    <li> Until now, I really didn&#x27;t give any thought to aromatherapy products and their specified purpose. I enjoy lavender at night but never felt like it put me to sleep. Chamomile tea is delicious but it never made me feel more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But THIS stuff- the orange ginger smell is amazing. I suds up my hands and inhale really deeply (like yoga breaths) four or five times and it really makes me feel clear headed and relaxed. My one year old son can be throwing toys into the shower, drag towels around the bathroom, bang on the cabinets and otherwise cause his usual mayhem and I swear... breathing this stuff in is so refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it is INCREDIBLY creamy on the skin. I was not expecting that at *all* since most clear body washes are water/alcohol/fragrance and wash away instantly. This one is thick and so moisturizing. I will never let it run out!!! Oh, and you can usually get it a couple dollars cheaper on Amazon. If you have Prime, buy it here! Save yourself the trip to the mall.</li>
    <li> smells great and feels even better. Used it as a shampoo on my color treated blonde hair and it works great!! highly recommend this one!!</li>
    <li> I searched for this body wash since using the orange/ginger soap and shampoo provided in Marriott Hotels when I traveled for work. The scent is amazing - it helps wake me up in the morning and lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order was packaged, processed and shipped perfectly and arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Orange Ginger body wash has a mild pleasant scent that reminds me of a high end spa.  The fragrance lasts nicely, if you combine it with the body lotion, but you can use perfume without creating a weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps skin nicely hydrated with a little glow and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!  also have the liquid hand soap.  the scent is so refreshing - even the men like it.</li>
    <li> What a simple and inexpensive way to treat yourself a little extra special each day! We keep a few different scents in the shower at all times! 4 star scent.</li>
    <li> I love that this body wash is not sweet smelling, at all. It smells like fresh oranges and ginger - not chemically at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it lathers great and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or tight skin.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this wash - especially in the morning.  There is enough smell to notice but not so much that it is overpowering.  I also purchased two others washes.  One for Sleep and one for Stress.  I&#x27;ve yet to find any as nice in drug stores.</li>
    <li> Great scent!! Excellent product</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon because it was more convenient for me to receive by mail in 2 days than to plan a 30 min drive to my nearest Bath and Body Works shop.  Orange Ginger is one of my favorite fragrances. I find it calming and opens my mind for the possibilities of a good day.  Highly recommend the product. And oh a little bit goes a long way for a bubble bath.  I also love this brand&#x27;s Eucalyptus Tea.</li>
    <li> I love the aroma of this stuff!!!!  Wish I could find something a bit more affordable but until I do, I&#x27;ll keep buying this one.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It is light enough not to be intrusive to those at a distance yet long lasting for those who like getting close.</li>
    <li> Awesome thanks. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I I would and plan to order this product again.I I truly appreciate and enjoy using this product</li>
    <li> Love the product nice aroma. would highly recommend it to family and friends plus it was a great low price</li>
    <li> It is a eye opener it the shower and smells so good! It&amp;#34;s like a glass of OJ is waiting for you when you step out of the shower!&lt;br /&gt;Like all of the aromatherapy soaps washes they are priceless! They do what the package says it gives you a boost makes you want to wake up and start your day with a  jump in your step!</li>
    <li> So glad I got this.  I missed this soap.  The orange ginger smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> After rest of order went awry ( which Amazon worked very hard to correct &amp; compensate for!), this was sole item of a rush birthday shipment to arrive in time through the snows of 2014.  Nanny thanks!  Recipient loves warm, spicy scent.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great!</li>
    <li> This product is great for women AND men. It is good in the bath tub as well as the shower. It has a really pleasant smell that is soothing and invigorating. We have actually bought quite a few of these to stock up as BBW often will discontinue a line without much notice... so if you like it, grab it up while you can!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of this that much. I love the vanilla blackcurrent so I&#x27;ll stick with that.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. It smells really good and leaves your skin soft.</li>
    <li> I had purchased item&lt;br /&gt;I have used this item and I will ask others also to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;Because this is the best in quality.</li>

    <li> The 10 oz size is very convenient.  This popular body wash is occasionally sold out in this size at the Bath Body Works stores.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this great deal.</li>
    <li> Great smelling body wash.</li>
    <li> I really believe it gives me energy after I shower with it. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> smells good and its refreshing. I will order this again next time I need a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;Have a good day</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE FRAGRANCE. Too bad I&#x27;m allergic</li>
    <li> I buyed this at Tices Corner,  Smells good.  You will like this one a lot! Orange Ginger is not to strong smelling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this brand of bath soap... and wanted to try a new fragrance.  The Energy Orange Ginger  is delightful.</li>
    <li> great.  Smell I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is not quite as nice as the Marriott blend but it is very close. The ginger scent is so soothing to me, I love it!</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> Brings me back to vacations at Marriott hotels... wonderful scent, fresh and bright!  Worth the price.  Scent last throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Oh, my goodness. It is so wonderful to have access to this product, again. I love the way it makes my skin feel and the scent. It is something I did not know I could get via Amazon until I was looking for something else. This was a Christmas gift Dec 2011 and then our home burned down in Feb 2012. Having this again, also, reminds me of the lovely person who gave it to me.</li>
