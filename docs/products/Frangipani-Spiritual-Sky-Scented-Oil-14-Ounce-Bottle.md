### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This stuff smells so nice!</li>
      <li>Smells so good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s staying power is not so good</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t give it an excellent because it seems to evaporate fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find a product that others claimed smelled exactly like the wonderfully fragrant flower...</li>
      <li>I love this and will buy more of it.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>Not one of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>love this</li>
      <li>My Mom and Sister used them too for many years before me.  </li>
      <li>I bought this \\&quot;oil\\&quot; to replace some Frangipani oil that I had found in Bali where the Frangipani blooms and smells wonderful, and where the oil is equally intoxicating.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely my favorite scent in the world.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS ONE ALSO</li>
      <li>-- maybe I&#x27;ve smelled too many of the real flowers to know what &#x27;bottled&#x27; Frangipani should smell like -- but this does not smell good.</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s Incense has the most variety and true fragrances.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an accurate \\&quot;frangipani\\&quot; fragrance, but it was inexpensive, so I will just try again.</li>
      <li>but I do enjoy mine...</li>
      <li>The vender was very prompt and it arrived just as described, so perhaps it&#x27;s my own scent memory that is lacking.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s easy to find right here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The price is right too!</li>
      <li>This Frangipani from Spiritual Sky is ok and will do.  </li>
      <li>Many different fragrances to choose from.</li>
      <li>The product is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance was non-descript and very far from the true fragrance of Frangipani.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a oil and stays on your skin all day long, I noticed when I was stressing at work it seemed like it was more potient.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore it.  </li>
      <li>It comes very close to the frangipani oil that I wore in the 1967.</li>
      <li>Response time was fast.  </li>
      <li>Thanks....</li>
      <li>Long lasting amazing scent.  </li>
      <li>Wow I should have read the other reviews more carefully...</li>
      <li>The scent is not as &#x27;accurate&#x27; as in decades past but, again, it will do as a fragrance oil, in general.</li>
      <li>You barely smell the Frangipani scent.  </li>
      <li>Tiny bottle and smells nothing like the natural Frangipani scent</li>

<li> I tried a few drops of the product in an oilburner with water.  </li>
<li> but I received this yesterday, tried it right away, and am disappointed to say that the closest thing it smells</li>
<li> This oil smells like cheap drug store perfume -- it is nasty -- and nothing like frangipani (plumeria).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> The oil is very thin, and watered down.  </li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
<li> Horrible...weak and artificial looking color.</li>
<li> Very sad.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had quality franginpani, and this isn&#x27;t it! :-(</li>

    <li> It comes very close to the frangipani oil that I wore in the 1967. It&#x27;s staying power is not so good but as I said it captures the essential smell of the oil. The price is right too!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so nice! I just love it. It&#x27;s a oil and stays on your skin all day long, I noticed when I was stressing at work it seemed like it was more potient. I would suggest you buy some. You won&#x27;t be sorry. PS. My hubby loves it as well!</li>
    <li> Divine Scented Perfume.  Smells so good I wanted to make out with myself.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I wanted.  Response time was fast.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would smell like....my fault</li>
    <li> I love this and will buy more of it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift but I do enjoy mine...love this</li>
    <li> I have been using Spiritual Sky oils for 30+ years.  My Mom and Sister used them too for many years before me.  So it was kinda a family thing.  Well.....I&#x27;ve searched for years for the scent Frangipani.  Oh my gosh....this scent is intoxicating.  I absolutely adore it.  Long lasting amazing scent.  Now it&#x27;s easy to find right here on Amazon.  Thanks....</li>
    <li> This Frangipani from Spiritual Sky is ok and will do.  The scent is not as &#x27;accurate&#x27; as in decades past but, again, it will do as a fragrance oil, in general.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS ONE ALSO, I LET MY DAUGHTER BORROW SOME SHE LOVES IT TO!!!!!!!!!! I WILL DEFINETLY BUY IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> I bought this \\&quot;oil\\&quot; to replace some Frangipani oil that I had found in Bali where the Frangipani blooms and smells wonderful, and where the oil is equally intoxicating.  This product was nothing like it. The fragrance was non-descript and very far from the true fragrance of Frangipani.  Maybe Frangipani was only used as a fancy name for this oil?  I tried a few drops of the product in an oilburner with water.  There was barely any oil on the surface of the water, the little red drops sunk to the bottom.   This bottle has hit the trash bin.</li>
    <li> Horrible...weak and artificial looking color. Nothing like 60&#x27;s at all!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find a product that others claimed smelled exactly like the wonderfully fragrant flower... but I received this yesterday, tried it right away, and am disappointed to say that the closest thing it smells like is a hotel bathroom. I don&#x27;t get even a hint of Frangipani -- maybe I&#x27;ve smelled too many of the real flowers to know what &#x27;bottled&#x27; Frangipani should smell like -- but this does not smell good. Very sad.</li>

    <li> Wow I should have read the other reviews more carefully... and I&#x27;ll be a bit stronger:  I just got back from a tropical isle where I smelled frangipani on a daily basis.  This oil smells like cheap drug store perfume -- it is nasty -- and nothing like frangipani (plumeria).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not one of my favorite scents.</li>
