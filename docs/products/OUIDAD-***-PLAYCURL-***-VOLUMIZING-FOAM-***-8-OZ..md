### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and this was awesome!</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 2 years and think this is the best on the market.</li>
      <li>This foam is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely wonderful!</li>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It has the lightest foam with great hold.</li>
      <li>This is a great styling product if your hair is thin/fine and curly.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it unless your hair was very healthy.</li>
      <li>While I find the scent pleasant, I would agree it&#x27;s very strong, and I would prefer a milder version of the scent.  </li>
      <li>I Just Love this product!</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know who would benefit from this.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend experimenting with the amount of product used to find what works best for you because it really depends on the thickness of your hair.  </li>
      <li>Ouidad products smell so much better.</li>
      <li>the curl quencher is my favorite.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s style for most of the day</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair and this is ok.</li>
      <li>I love, love , love this foam.  </li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>Love all of Ouidad products.  </li>
      <li>Love the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it has product in it at all and yet holds</li>
      <li>(note: if you use a blowdryer and diffuser with this, the fullness that PlayCurl foam gives you is much more noticable).</li>
      <li>Ouidad also recommends using their &amp;#34;rake and shake&amp;#34; technique with this product, but I find just scrunching it into my hair works better for me.  </li>
      <li>For the first time in xxx years, I embrace my curls and am glad to have them!</li>
      <li>The foam isn&#x27;t strong either.</li>
      <li>I recently found out about the new PlayCurl collection from Ouidad and it is perfect for my hair.</li>
      <li>On days that I want to add even more volume, I add PlayCurl Volumizing Styling Gel Spray first, then the foam and blowdry my hair with a diffuser.</li>
      <li>The good news is that once my hair is dry, the scent isn&#x27;t nearly as strong.</li>
      <li>I do not wash my hair every day, and on day 2 of a wash when using this product, I am able to dampen my hair with Ouidad&#x27;s Refreshing Spray, re-scrunch (without adding more product), let it dry naturally and have nice curls again.</li>
      <li>This works okay and is nice and light and not very sticky.</li>
      <li>Purchased my first container at my local beauty shop for 50% more than at Amazon.</li>
      <li>I liked the way it defined my curls, but it seemed to pull my hair down and leave it a bit flatter than I&#x27;d like (even after scrunching my hair to break the cast of the gel).  </li>
      <li>It is very drying.</li>
      <li>thanks for asking though.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>It adds lift to my hair and is really neat how it makes my curls stand out.</li>
      <li>The volumizing foam really helps &amp;#34;pump...</li>
      <li>It gives some control over the frizzie &amp; is very lightweight.  </li>
      <li>I have always had fine, thin curls and now my hair is thinning even more with age (in my 50&#x27;s).  </li>
      <li>Love this company&#x27;s products, I&#x27;m not sure how much volume it really added to my hair...</li>
      <li>I had a hard time finding a product for curly hair that I liked</li>
      <li>Because my short hair is very fine, it is difficult to use many of the hair products on the market.  </li>
      <li>The product itself may actually work on hair that needs  it, but first you have to get pass the smell.</li>
      <li>It does not provide quite the curl definition that using a gel does, but personally, I think I like the soft, slightly looser curls this product give me better.  </li>
      <li>In reading other reviews, I noticed several comments about the strong scent of this product.  </li>
      <li>With naturally curly hair, I have no frizzes</li>
      <li>Although my hair is already curly I am giving this product 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t weight or tangle my hair and leaves it soft and bouncy.</li>
      <li>Soft curls.</li>
      <li>Ouidad volumizing foam makes my hair incredibly full and soft especially when I use a diffuser to dry my curls.  </li>
      <li>and it allows my hair to dry soft and full with a simple lift of a comb.</li>
      <li>or it&#x27;s fine, not sure which).</li>
      <li>I always blow dry my hair with a diffuser, but I would be interested to see if this product will work as well if I let my hair dry naturally, maybe even give me the &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; that everyone wants in the summer.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a couple other volumizing foams, but they left my hair dry and did nothing to enhance the natural curl, not to mention I never noticed more volume after using them.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and adds volume to your hair  </li>
      <li>I was using thick gels and lotions, which I thought were working, but really were just weighing my hair down more and making it sticky.</li>
      <li>I only gave it 4 stars because I have found many other curly hair mousses that define my curls a lot better that were less expensive.</li>
      <li>I have average-texture, naturally curly (mostly S-wavy), color-treated hair that is on the average to slightly thin side.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great styling product if your hair is thin/fine and curly. It&#x27;s light enough so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and adds volume to your hair  (note: if you use a blowdryer and diffuser with this, the fullness that PlayCurl foam gives you is much more noticable). Usually I combine this product with just a dime-sized amount of Ouidad&#x27;s Moisture Lock Gel and either blowdry or let it air dry. On days that I want to add even more volume, I add PlayCurl Volumizing Styling Gel Spray first, then the foam and blowdry my hair with a diffuser. I&#x27;ve found that I use less of all the ouidad products (maybe because my hair is just above my shoulders or it&#x27;s fine, not sure which). Love the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it has product in it at all and yet holds it&#x27;s style for most of the day (depends on the weather here). Since I&#x27;ve started using these products, I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments on my curls. Finally, I like my curls. You won&#x27;t find me trying to hide my curls by pulling my hair back into a ponytail anymore. I&#x27;ve also used Schwarzkopf Bonacure Moisture Kick line of products (which works as well for me) however,I do not like the chemical smell that Schwarzkopf products seem to have. Ouidad products smell so much better.</li>
    <li> So playful, So curly...so playfully curly!!!</li>
    <li> I recently found out about the new PlayCurl collection from Ouidad and it is perfect for my hair. I was using thick gels and lotions, which I thought were working, but really were just weighing my hair down more and making it sticky. My current curly hair routine is the PlayCurl spray, then this PlayCurl foam and I finish it off with the Ouidad styling mist. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Too stiff for curly hair and kinda oily looking.</li>
    <li> I Just Love this product! It has the lightest foam with great hold. Hard to find in the retail market.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. I didn&#x27;t see any change in volume. The foam isn&#x27;t strong either.</li>
    <li> I have average-texture, naturally curly (mostly S-wavy), color-treated hair that is on the average to slightly thin side.  For the past couple years I have been using a light-weight defining gel designed for curly hair recommended to me by a hair stylist.  I liked the way it defined my curls, but it seemed to pull my hair down and leave it a bit flatter than I&#x27;d like (even after scrunching my hair to break the cast of the gel).  I have tried a couple other volumizing foams, but they left my hair dry and did nothing to enhance the natural curl, not to mention I never noticed more volume after using them.  But Ouidad&#x27;s Volumizing Foam has delivered its volume claim.  I can see a noticeable difference, especially at the roots of my hair.  It does not provide quite the curl definition that using a gel does, but personally, I think I like the soft, slightly looser curls this product give me better.  I do not wash my hair every day, and on day 2 of a wash when using this product, I am able to dampen my hair with Ouidad&#x27;s Refreshing Spray, re-scrunch (without adding more product), let it dry naturally and have nice curls again. I always blow dry my hair with a diffuser, but I would be interested to see if this product will work as well if I let my hair dry naturally, maybe even give me the &amp;#34;beachy waves&amp;#34; that everyone wants in the summer.

    <li> Absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and this is ok. It seems to weigh my hair down and not provide volume. I followed the directions and tried applying it several ways and it still seems to weigh my hari down.</li>
    <li> the smell of this product is just awful. Not at all like the other Ouidad products. The product itself may actually work on hair that needs  it, but first you have to get pass the smell. thanks for asking though.</li>
    <li> Ouidad has changed my life. Seriously. No more frizz, no more having to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair from scratch every day. For the first time in xxx years, I embrace my curls and am glad to have them! The volumizing foam really helps &amp;#34;pump...them up&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> This product did not make my hair curl up and it made it very dry.  I honestly don&#x27;t know who would benefit from this.  My hair is wavy and it&#x27;s supposed to be for wavy hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it unless your hair was very healthy. It is very drying.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long curly hair. This product helps me maintain my hair for 2 to 3 days without having to worry with styling my unruled hair every morning. Although my hair is already curly I am giving this product 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t weight or tangle my hair and leaves it soft and bouncy. If it wasn&#x27;t for the price and small bottle I&#x27;d give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Because my short hair is very fine, it is difficult to use many of the hair products on the market.  They are generally too heavy &amp; weigh my hair down.  This foam is perfect.  It gives some control over the frizzie &amp; is very lightweight.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I love, love , love this foam.  I have always had fine, thin curls and now my hair is thinning even more with age (in my 50&#x27;s).  Ouidad volumizing foam makes my hair incredibly full and soft especially when I use a diffuser to dry my curls.  I highly recommend this!</li>

    <li> This works okay and is nice and light and not very sticky. I only gave it 4 stars because I have found many other curly hair mousses that define my curls a lot better that were less expensive. With this one I have to add on a spray gel for curls, also.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 years and think this is the best on the market. Soft curls.</li>
    <li> Love this company&#x27;s products, I&#x27;m not sure how much volume it really added to my hair...the curl quencher is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Tried this and the Botanical Boost Moisturizer and both made my fine 2b curly/wavy hair just look dirty and weighed down. Very disappointed as I love natural products and had high hopes for this brand.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Non sticky, light, fluffy and lifts my heavy hair.  I use clips with my curly hair and they work well with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. It adds lift to my hair and is really neat how it makes my curls stand out.</li>
    <li> Love all of Ouidad products.  I had a hard time finding a product for curly hair that I liked and this was awesome!</li>
