<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this product is great and love love this</li>
    <li> I like it, but for my acne it works best the Klairs Charcoal soap.</li>
    <li> This is extremely harsh and drying. Tried as both a face and body wash and I have never had such dry skin. Its winter where I am and i&#x27;m sure that if I keep using this soap I&#x27;ll have eczema soon. Haven&#x27;t noticed any real changes to the acne I currently have either.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, I use it in the morning alone to wash my face and then put Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Control Moisturizer on. At night in the shower I use it to wash my face before using the Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Scrub, followed by the same CC moisturizer when I get out. My face has never been so clear! It&#x27;s a decent size and you get 3, I just use it for my face so I&#x27;m still on the first bar and have used it for few months now.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff great for acne.  Just follow up with a moisturizer</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this soap and I feel clean after using it... no residue and a pleasant smell. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a benefit so far, but I have only been using it for a couple weeks. I use this for my face/body. It is gentle and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Hey ladies- know those really expensive &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands of charcoal soap that cost you half your paycheck? Well, after trying those I can promise you that these work just as well, but this soap is inexpensive enough that you won&#x27;t be raging mad when you walk in on your boyfriend washing his naughty bits with it every time you turn around.</li>
    <li> These bars are wonderful. I am in my late twenties and suffer from mild acne/hormonal acne, but acne treatments tend to make my skin dry/dehydrated/flaky. I oil-cleanse with coconut oil and then wash the oil off with this soap. My acne did clear up nicely and my skin stopped flaking. This soap does not strip the skin. I would say it takes about 1 week to show results (reduction of inflammation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap smells wonderful to me--sort of like texas cedarwood. I use this in addition to a vitamin-c serum and aloe vera gel as a moisturizer. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in hyperpigmentation solely from using this soap because I do use a vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> this is decent for the price. Don&#x27;t expect it to be the same as coalface.  The exfoliants aren&#x27;t as good and the ingredients aren&#x27;t as unprocessed. It&#x27;s decent for the price but I will probably go back to coalface once I run out.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product, but not for me. I have oily acne prone skin and was expecting it to help with my breakouts. I noticed that my acne pretty much stayed put, but was surprised to find that this bar was a great exfoliator and skin brighter. Also going to see if I can find something more natural; not too sure about it after giving the ingredients a second look.</li>
    <li> Used toothpaste n shampoo charcoal based,  thought soap would be similarly brilliant. However bit disappointed its just about ok, similar to other soaps.</li>
    <li> This soap is the best!!!! At first I thought some of the reviews were to good to be true.... Well the truth is,this product is top knotch! I notice several things that this product has helped me with.  One being it is helping to tone my skin, reducing pimples and more softer.  I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Compares favorably with the Charcoal skin diver soap sold in the US by Origins. It clears my skin of blemishes and acne. Unlike other soaps (like African Palm Ash soap) there is barely a scent. No more smelling like rancid licorice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is another great selling point. Less than 1/3 the cost of Origins&#x27; soap, which is the only other soap I&#x27;ve found that helps my skin remain blemish free.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, it isn&#x27;t as messy as it would have thought and does appear to help with skin irritation.</li>
    <li> i was interested in the antibacterial properties of charcoal. i shower at least twice a day, sometimes three times if i play sports, which is why i wanted something that was mild but got the job done.</li>
    <li> I definetly will buy more. I just appreciated the lather. thanks</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  My skin feels really clean and soft.  I did not see any little dry flakes at the end of the day, as I normally do. One bar really last a long time!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, i had some bacne and it cleared it right up.</li>
    <li> No fine charcoal powder to deal with, just the great scent and cleaning power.  Smooth, sudsy and you get three.</li>
    <li> Works really well for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my teenaged son who suffers from terrible acne and even he is amazed at the results.  He has less outbreaks, redness and swelling were significantly lessened and his face looks smoother and more even-toned. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the effectiveness. As for some complaints by others about the scent of the soap, it really isn&#x27;t a deterrent and the benefits are the selling point here.  I do not hesitate to recommend this to anyone looking for a soap that truly cleanses and caresses your skin.</li>
    <li> I will give this product 3 stars for now because i know that charcoal soap really does work for certain types of Acne.  After i use the product more , i will update my review!  I am happy with my purchase and the size of the bars are large!</li>
    <li> I have systic acne and very oily sensitive skin I&#x27;m 25 and have been searching for a face wash that wouldn&#x27;t break me out. At last I have been using the soap for about a week now and haven&#x27;t had any new break outs and I have noticed my skin clearing up ! My husband even noticed the difference ! Life changing !</li>
    <li> I used to use the Nippon Kodo Pelican Deitanseki Soap, but decided to try this one because its item price was cheaper since it came with 3 bars. The Deitanseki soap worked very well for me before, and this one works great too. Though the Deitanseki soap smells better, this charcoal soap doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent on you afterwards, so I don&#x27;t mind it. I used to break out once in a while on my back, but after using a whole bar of this, I haven&#x27;t seen any breakouts or problems with my skin. I don&#x27;t use it on my face because it&#x27;s a bit too dry and didn&#x27;t seem to provide any benefits. I will be purchasing these charcoal bars instead of the Deitanseki ones from now on.</li>
    <li> this soap has kept my skin so clear, I stopped using it for awhile and broke out everywhere but I got some more so no more problems! Wonderful soap would recommend to everyone :D</li>
    <li> best thing every. I am 29 and have tried everything for acne. I do not suffer from a lot of acne but I always have something that could be covered up. This has changed my face so much. I will always use it. :)</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product!</li>
    <li> I really like this soap and how it feels after I use it. I miss the grains of sand in my charcol soap, but it seems everyone is stopping that practice. This is a great soap to help with sensitive skin. Is AWESOME on my eczema. And oddly, I get complimented on the soap smell REGULARLY! 3rd purchase to date and will buy these over and over!</li>
    <li> BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE- At first I had this item in my cart and then moved it to my wish list. Eventually I deleted it altogether. Now, this item REPEATEDLY SHOWS UP IN MY CART despite my NOT EVER ordering it or even having it in my wish list. I have contacted Amazon and they have no explanation for it either. My only guess is that somehow SOMEONE HAS HACKED INTO MY ACCOUNT and keeps adding this item in my cart. Since this &amp;#34;mysterious&amp;#34; occurrence is only happening with THIS SOAP, and keeps repeating itself every few days, I can only wonder whether this company/distributor is doing this to me. I AM GOING TO REPORT THIS TO THE FCC IF AMAZON DOES NOT PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. BEWARE ALL CONSUMERS LOOKING AT THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> Given my first one as a gift who visited Japan.  Loved it/  Found these on Amazon and am very happy with them.  They last forever. Keep the bar standing so not much left in the soapdish as it dries</li>
    <li> Great soap. I get dried skin quite frequently that looks almost like an old sunburn (not that bad at all, I just felt like saying it). But when I use this stuff, some how it causes the dead skin to literally rub right off, it&#x27;s awesome. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but function over form any day. I would pair this with another daily soap (I use Billy Jealousy&#x27;s White Knight, the two work great together) and a facial moisturizer after the shower.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I use it 4-3 times a week. I have oily skin and it kind of dries it out however at night I moisturize with vitamin E oil and in the AM I don&#x27;t wake up oily. It&#x27;s a good balance.</li>
    <li> It is excellent for removal of blackheads and keeping the skin clear and feeling refreshed. I loved washing my face with this and went through each bar rather quickly. Hence an order of 2 more packages. The price is also right and worth every cent. I will continue to order this as long as it exists.</li>
    <li> I decided to use this soap along with the Oleavine All Natural Konjac Sponge - Activated Charcoal - Gentle Exfoliating Facial Sponge  (also sold on Amazon), and it&#x27;s one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve ever made!  I could feel the difference after the first use and could see the improvement shortly thereafter.  Although I&#x27;d never heard of using a charcoal based product before, these 2 have made a believer out of me!!!</li>
    <li> Nothing feels cleaner than a good charcoal soap. This one has a good lather and a mild scent. And black looks great in a 21st century bathroom.</li>
    <li> love this soap!  I bought it after all the positive reviews and was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a makeup remover to take off my waterproof mascara right, then wash my face with this soap.  It takes off the foundation completely!  I have adult acne, and using this soap twice a day has kept it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Delightful soap with a great smell that is not artificial or overly scented. Its a japanese smell so not everyone will like it. The feel of the soap is also very nice, with a slight amount of texture when you scrub. Leaves you feeling really clean and nice.</li>
    <li> Great body soap! I tried it for the first time today and I love it, lathers up nice and leaves you feeling clean without all the perfume smell that most soaps have. Definitely buying this again..</li>
    <li> This soap has a very clearing quality to it - making your skin very soft and clear - hard to put into words.  Very nice feeling, highly recommended. Great for acne and eczema!</li>
    <li> This soap is ok; mild, pleasant smell.  I do not feel it is as effective as other charcoal soaps at really deep cleaning my skin.  Good deal for 3 bars, but there are better charcoal soaps out there.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and so the water quality varies from state to state and country to country. This soap has helped me manage a pretty balanced skin from being either too dry or too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++ 3 bars last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;+ Not harsh on my skin at all&lt;br /&gt;+ Not much of a scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It can be a bit more gooey than a regular bar of soap towards the end of its usefulness</li>
    <li> This soap is great for cleaning you face without leaving it too dry.  My face feels fresh and smooth!</li>
    <li> I used the biore charcoal soap for the longest time. When I ran out of that, I thought it was time to switch to a different product. I initially decided to buy this product because of the positive reviews. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does what it is supposed to do, however, the bars are very large to the point that I could not comfortably lather them in my hands. Cutting it into smaller pieces seemed like a good idea at the time. Each piece that I cut off broke into smaller pieces. With that being said, these bars are very fragile. I should have known considering how soft they were. Another thing is that these bars of soap have a terrible smell. They smell closer to burnt plastic than charcoal. Other than that, great product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 and I still breakout, and always had a hard time finding something that didn&#x27;t dry out my face too much.  This stuff really made my face breakout less.</li>
    <li> I use this daily to wash my face and head (i&#x27;m bald). This gets my skin squeaky clean and doesn&#x27;t dry out my pores.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and the bars are a good size and can last about 7-9 days per bar.</li>
    <li> This is good soap, rinses clean in hard water</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this bath soap. I have very sensitive combination skin. If the soap is strong enough to cut the oil it will cause irritation, or doesn&#x27;t call irritation but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin clean. This soap is the cure! It leaves your skin smooth and clean without being over drying or having irritating perfumes and dyes. It lathers well and rinses clean. This will become one of my regular purchases. The one draw back is that the soap smells, well, it smells like burnt bamboo. The scent isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t remain on the skin after washing. You just smell clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 24-year-old male with oily, acne-prone skin. My skin is highly reactive to my skincare regimen - if something isn&#x27;t right, it&#x27;ll show up immediately. The flip-side of that is that it also tends to be more obvious when something *does* work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is excellent. It&#x27;s cheap (even cheaper at Mitsuwa market, if you have one nearby), of high quality, and does exactly what it should. I&#x27;ve been using this as my sole cleanser after seeing (and feeling) the immediate results from it. My skin is oily, and this leaves it feeling incredibly clean without feeling dry. The scent is good (a hint of charcoal, of course) and it lathers up very easily. With this being an integral part of my new skincare regimen, I&#x27;ve had my best luck ever with preventing acne and defeating it if anything ever does show up. I don&#x27;t see myself using another cleanser ever again when this one is so economical, gentle, and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my girlfriend also was getting a little bit of acne for a week until I gave her one of these bars. She has since cleared up completely.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this soap.  I have gone back to other soaps if I&#x27;ve ran out but always return to this soap. I feeĺ so much cleaner literaly squeeky clean compared to other soaps. I make sure now that I always have a good supply! !</li>
    <li> I have combination skin which gets really oily around my noise and forehead, especially after working out.  I have been using the same liquid soap for years along with baking soda to scrub my face.  Sometimes even that doesn&#x27;t get all the oil build-up.  I started using this as a follow-up wash and it really gets my skin clean without drying it out.  I also use it on my shoulders because I break out there a little now and then but not the rest of my body.  If I use it where my skin isn&#x27;t oily then it feels almost dried out, yet it isn&#x27;t.  For me, this is best used on my face and shoulders but your mileage may vary depending on your skin.  Charcoal is really in right now and this soap is very cost effective and it works! It&#x27;s definitely worth a try to see if you should make it part of your beauty arsenal!</li>
    <li> Not as much charcoal as I expected. This is more like a bar of soap with a little bit of charcoal in it. Great for the body, not as much exfoliates for your face.</li>
    <li> Nice not griddy. I live where its in the 90&#x27;s w humidity several months yearly this is a good helper.</li>
    <li> I dont like this product.</li>
    <li> Not the real thing! And the smell gags me! Ask for ingredients. I bet there&#x27;s a lot of fake stuff in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;ve always suffered from acne on my face and body. So far my face is much much better and my body seems to be looking better as well. It was pretty bad (acne) so its still clearing. It has a sorta soapy film feel, but it is fine, really. I also don&#x27;t feel any exfoliating things so if it DOES exfoliate, that&#x27;s cool, but there is nothing (so far, few weeks into the bar) sloughing away my skin</li>
    <li> Although each bar isn&#x27;t too large, having three in the package is really nice.  This soap suds up real easy and does not leave a soap streak when placed back down in the shower/tray.  This soap and Deitanseki are my number one choice for charcoal soaps.</li>
    <li> This soap basically rules the world! After being shoddy at cooking for, hmm... thirtyish years... I&#x27;ve finally gotten into it, which means that I need something that WILL be effective at neutralising strong food odours but will NOT wreak havoc on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from products I&#x27;ve made myself (my current claim to fame is a clean-rinsing, whipped, healing butter that works wonders on scrapes), this is my go-to and top &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; (cleaning/cleansing) product for the kitchen and bathroom and workroom.</li>
    <li> Definitely helped out with my rash and pimple situation. I&#x27;m in a very damp place where I&#x27;m constant in sweat and all sorts of moisture. Keeps the rash and clogged pores at bay!</li>
    <li> Nice charcoal soap bar!</li>
    <li> Bought this because I have very sensitive skin and psoriasis.  It does not have much smell and cannot really say much about the overall quality.  It does get you clean and does not leave any residue but there are other products out there that have been much more satisfying.  All in all, serves the purpose but will not excite you in the soap department.</li>
    <li> I like this soap. It helps with acne and it has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap, but somewhat drying. Very helpful with mild breakouts.</li>
    <li> The best soap is charcoal soap!  You&#x27;ll never feel cleaner!</li>
    <li> Really gets in there and cleans that oil out. I also think it helps the skin exfoliate as well. Smells nice and lasts about as long as any bar soap does. Make sure to moisturize after using.</li>
    <li> I love it. Cleans off my facial makeup better than any other soap I&#x27;ve used. Will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have had keratosis pilaris since I was a child.  My mother always thought I didn&#x27;t wash myself and that was why I had small bumps on my upper arm.  Over the years I tried everything: exfoliating soaps, lotions, creams, and scrubbing mitts. I purchased this a month ago and my arm has never felt so smooth.  And I have used one bar everyday so far and it hardly looks used, so I figure these three bars will last at least a year.</li>
    <li> Removes my makeup and is working great.  Large bars!  Leaves your skin feeling very clean after.  Feels high quality. :)</li>
    <li> Wish I knew about these soap bars earlier. Great for washing face, hands, and body. And super affordable. No longer need to waste money on expensive face wash. This can remove all makeup</li>
    <li> bought this soap, LOVED it. My whole family was using it and we were raving about it. Showed it to a friend and he checked the ingredients. He asked me if I knew what tetrasodium edta was. I said no. So, I looked it up later that day. NOT GOOD PEOPLE. Look it up. Tetrasodium ETDA, made from ethylenediamine, formaldehyde—a known carcinogen according to the National Cancer Institute—and sodium cyanide (which is made from the toxic gas hydrogen cyanide).&lt;br /&gt;It gets worse. This ingredient is also a penetration enhancer. That means it breaks down the skin’s protective barrier, making it easier for other potentially harmful ingredients in the formula to sink deeper into your tissues and perhaps even into your bloodstream.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many great charcoal soaps out there, not need to put this on OR technically IN your body!!!</li>
    <li> My teenagers love it.  Keeps their face looking great!  The second we run out, they start to break out.</li>
    <li> I love how this soap makes my skin feel.  I have a mild condition that requires a topical steroid cream and this doesn&#x27;t seem to bother it at all, in fact I&#x27;ve noticed when I use it my skin doesn&#x27;t need the cream as often, if at all.</li>
    <li> Read so many good reviews I decided to give it a try.  Love this soap!  You can smell the charcoal a little when using it but amazingly only the floral scent lingers afterwards.  After shower the skin felt squeaky clean, I was afraid it was going to leave my skin dry.  Instead it left my skin silky all day, did not need moisturizer at all.  I usually do not use soap on my face, but now I wash my face with this and I am no longer in need of expensive facial cleanser.  I also noticed that little red bumps I had on my upper arms are disappearing!  The soap is black, and when water hits it the soap turns mottled grey -- bit weird looking.  I only wish three soap bars came individually wrapped, but I just wrapped them in wax paper and put them in a zip lock bag.  One bar is lasting me over a month now, but I use it with a sponge cloth and it lathers up nicely.  Package is in Japanese and seems to be an authentic Japanese product.  Says ships from Japan but it only took 5 days to Atlanta. PS : I realized the package actually says &amp;#34;cosmetic soap&amp;#34; so this is really a facial soap.  Maybe I&#x27;m being extravagant using it on my whole body, at $3 a bar, but it sure makes my skin feel like I just spent a day at a mineral spa!</li>
    <li> Had problems with body acne and since I started using this product- not a problem any longer!! Finally!! No need to spend money on crap that doesn&#x27;t work anymore!!</li>
    <li> Good deal, charcoal seems effective.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I like the squeaky clean feel after and the price. Don&#x27;t have acne so not sure about that.</li>
    <li> This soap was to replace some other charcoal-based soap I used in the past. I will not go back to the other brand, now, actually. The soap is not only mild, but also has a light fragrance that is non-irritating. It cleans thoroughly and has very light exfoliating granules that enhance its feel when used for washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order was also processed promptly and what arrived was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap also lasts a long time, making it a good value.</li>
    <li> Totally satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend this item for anyone looking for smoother, softer skin. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this soap</li>
    <li> This soap is a great product for people with light body acne or other skin concerns.  It lacks the heavy moisturizers and filmy residue of most of the other shower bars on the market while also containing charcoal to actively remove impurities.  The light cypress scent reminds me of a traditional japanese bath. I don&#x27;t use it on my face because it would be too drying.</li>
    <li> Loved it, wonderful not drying, good for sensitive skin. Use dark soap dish because black suds make gray drops on sink and tub.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, my face has cleared and no blemishes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of charcoal soap. I live in an arid area and have sensitive and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;Good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Price is very good for getting 3 good size bars.&lt;br /&gt;Foams well, don&#x27;t have to use too much like other charcoal soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Only one- and that&#x27;s the smell. It literally smells like crayons! I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s from the bamboo? Don&#x27;t know. Skin doesn&#x27;t smell like the soap after use which is good. I still gave this 5 stars as the smell doesn&#x27;t affect performance. Smell is strong when you first open the package but dwindles after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Wanted to add: This stuff lasts ALOT longer per bar than other charcoal soaps i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using those soaps. They are really strong in cleaning, yet do not make your skin too try after using them.</li>
    <li> different. But I like this soap. Not too drying, and gets you very clean. Not expensive give it a shot. I will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> This soap is fantastic. It feels clean, no residue, no scent really. people ask how my nails are so white, and I noticed that its after using this soap. Cost and delivery good, will keep using. Good quality product from Japan.</li>
    <li> First &amp; foremost its natural. I used it in healing ring worm, it took away the inflammation and the itching. Now I am using the soap in W. Africa. It works wonders in healing heat rash and getting the bacteria off the skin and I used it in treating skin infected with parasites. I would recommend this soap for anyone on daily basis for getting rid of the mundane bacteria off the skin that causes odor and skin issues.</li>
    <li> I expected a lot more, it just seems like regular soap that dries my skin out. Went back to Dove bar soap.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it had that charcoal smell thsy is original. No perfume or dye. It leaves my skin feeling clean while using a face scrubbing cloth. However I still need to moisturize.</li>
    <li> Update: I ordered this soap years ago, and after having a terrible reaction to it I stopped using it. 2 years of having this soap lie around with no use for it annoyed me, and I had several bars left of it too. So, one day on a whim I decided to try cleaning my makeup sponges and brushes with it. O..M..G!!! This soap got makeup out of my utensils better than anything I have ever tried in the past, and I&#x27;ve tried MANY! It even removed the stains deep down in my beauty blenders! It also removed stains in a brush I thought were permanent do to my chocolate complexion. For that I have updated my rating to 5 stars. Will now order again when I run out.     Havent noticed a big difference in my acne. Maybe it hasnt been long enough. It does cause my skin to tingle,and sometimes itch a little. I noticed I have to be careful what I put on my face after I use this. First day of use I made the mistake of applying a vitamin E cream. It caused a horrible rash on one side of my nose I&#x27;m still trying to even out. Its so odd that this only occurred in the one spot and no where else.</li>
    <li> Much cheeper than other charcoal soaps I have used and the results are the same.  Good buy for the money!</li>
    <li> the smell isn&#x27;t really that nice compare to another kind of charcoal soap (the big rectangular one)</li>
    <li> I have cronic dry skin and have to use lotion constantly . Ive used all kinds and tried the moisture organic body washes to see if that would help nothing works til I came accoss this bamboo charcoal soap its like a little miracle bar just after the first use wow . So its been 3 weeks since Ive started using this soap and started using it on my face  amazing my skin looks and feels so good I havent had to use any lotion since I started finally a soap that works I am truly hooked and will continue to use Japans miracle soap I just wish it was easier available here in the US.</li>
    <li> Excellent charcoal soap at a really good price.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for the price! I have extremely sensitive skin, prone to breakouts, and this product has been by far the best cleanser for my skin type yet. The bars last for a good bit of time. I&#x27;ve been using the same bar for about 3 weeks, solely on my face, and have barely made a dent. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase another pack in the future.</li>
    <li> Love the soaps.  I&#x27;m able to share with others.  It gives a sqeaky clean feel.  Would definetly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Can not tell if it makes a huge difference to skin but I like it.</li>
</ol>
