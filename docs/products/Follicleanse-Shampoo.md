      <li>I purchased this product for my dad as a Christmas gift and he loved it.</li>
      <li>Being able to purchase it through Amazon prime was an added bonus!</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this first before ordering the Plus version and this seems to be working perfectly.</li>

      <li>I suffer from very oily hair/ithcy dry scalp and this product is great!</li>
      <li>This shampoo is good if you have simple oily hair and clogged pores, but if you have any bumps or cysts, save your money and go to the doctor.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for so enjoy your new healthy hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>All thoughts are my own and no other&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Normally, I rotate this shampoo with another healthy hair plus shampoo for oily hair.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo really helps keep my scalp feeling clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s all natural and a way to clean even the hair follicles  to help keep the skin / scalp clean and</li>
      <li>Healthy Hait Plus shampoos are the only ones that helped me.  </li>
      <li>He is about 3/4 done with the bottle, and while the follicles are still oil free, the cysts are back in full force.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am almost completely clear of acne now from head to toe and look very healthy.  </li>

      <li>I was on a mission to find a gentle shampoo.</li>
      <li>My hair feels really hydrated after i used it.</li>
      <li>my hair also cleans my hair very well.</li>
      <li>There is nothing gentle about this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and hair</li>
      <li>I think the shampoo smells good, like an faint herbally clean smell, nothing overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>I will recommend this product to my friends who have normal to oily hair!</li>
      <li>not only cleans the hair, but it will clean the scalp to keep it from itching and causing dandruff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shampoo will kep my hair looking clean even through the next morning.  </li>
      <li>Yes, the bottle is small but it contains good ingredients, it left my hair feeling soft and full.</li>
      <li>My hair and scalp feel and look healthy and even after 24 hrs of washing my oil levels are down by 75%.</li>
      <li>I highly reccommend this.</li>
      <li>At first I used it daily, but it was overly drying.</li>
      <li>I have fine, oily hair that can look oily by late afternoon if I use normal shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t rate this high enough.</li>
      <li>also tried the Seabuckthorn Oil Shampoo from Blue Sage Naturals and that&#x27;s really the only shampoo that&#x27;s ever done anything for my scalp, so</li>
      <li>There has been no other compensation, nor is there any intended.</li>
      <li>I have noticed no difference in this product than other products of a similar nature except the price is higher with this product.</li>
      <li>Hair felt clean at least</li>
      <li>(Middle of my back length) even developed the bumps in my scalp.  </li>
      <li>It was ok but not good enough to use long term.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product helps with dry and itchy scalp. My hair feels really hydrated after i used it. i recommend this for anyone who needs help to relief dandruff.</li>
    <li> I rotate between using this shampoo and the prescription shampoo my doctor recommended.  My scalp feels great when I use this shampoo - no itchy sore spots afterwards.  However, I&#x27;m not that thrilled with the smell...slightly like doggie shampoo.  This scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger in the hair though.</li>
    <li> Overall this shampoo is very good! it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair also cleans my hair very well. I will recommend this product to my friends who have normal to oily hair!</li>
    <li> the ad shows a big bottle and all you get is a tiny one. Hate the false advertising it should be illegal. The product itself was worse! Has ingredients in it that are known to cause problems for scalp...sodium laureth sulfate (largest ingredient besides water)...and my scalp itched worse and got worse since I switched to this from Demarest. Worst money Ive ever spent and first time Ive ever felt the need to review or complain in print! Dont buy this!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cleansing shampoos ever!&lt;br /&gt;It not only cleans the hair, but it will clean the scalp to keep it from itching and causing dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural and a way to clean even the hair follicles  to help keep the skin / scalp clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo cleans the oil, dirt and product buildup, reduces the oil production and also reduces the ability of dandruff.  It&#x27;s THE best anti-dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve ever came across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried this on one of my pets that have a flaking skin condition.  It works wonderful on pets as well since it is all natural.  Just keep away from the face of a pet if you decide to use this on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;- See more at: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my honest review and thoughts. All thoughts are my own and no other&#x27;s. There has been no other compensation, nor is there any intended.</li>
    <li> Was looking for help for my oily hair and dry scalp.  Descriptions seemed good but it just didn&#x27;t clean both hair and scalp evenly.  It was ok but not good enough to use long term.</li>
    <li> It was OK... Hair felt clean at least</li>
    <li> I suffer from very oily hair/ithcy dry scalp and this product is great! Within 2 days of using it I notice the biggest difference. My hair and scalp feel and look healthy and even after 24 hrs of washing my oil levels are down by 75%. (Crazy I know...) I was skeptical at first because I have tried alot of different \\&quot;dandruff/fine oily\\&quot; shampoos and none can even come close to the results that Follicleanse has shown. I think the shampoo smells good, like an faint herbally clean smell, nothing overpowering at all. (not anything close to the smell of dog shampoo) I wanted to try this first before ordering the Plus version and this seems to be working perfectly. I will be recommending this to all of my family/friends who have the same condition.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and hair so I was looking for a shampoo to help with my oliy scalp.  I found this one and gave it a try.  Didn&#x27;t see a difference at all.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be any different than the shampoos at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I ordered something else in the same order and THIS company didn&#x27;t ship the item until I got the other item three days later.  Then this product irritated my scalp much worse than it was!  It left my hair straw like and felt like it damaged my hair.  (Middle of my back length) even developed the bumps in my scalp.  Definitely not as advertised.  There is nothing gentle about this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and scalp conditions and this works!  I have scalp acne that comes and goes and this keeps it from flaring up.  I have a condition called keratosis pilaris where I&#x27;m prone to blockage in hair follicles all over.  I could also have diabetes or maybe an allergic reaction to wheat but haven&#x27;t gotten the blood tests done yet.  They&#x27;re expensive.  I will soon.  I truly recommend this to anyone that has a similar issues.  This works on my scalp.  This is only the 8 oz bottle so realize that before buying.  You can get the 12 oz bottle for $4-5 more.  You get what you pay for so enjoy your new healthy hair and scalp.  Otherwise for my body I use Theraneem Facial Bar for my body and Proactive for my face.  Overall, I am almost completely clear of acne now from head to toe and look very healthy.  I hope this helps someone.  Pass the information on if it works for you but see a doctor if the condition persists!</li>
    <li> Yes, the bottle is small but it contains good ingredients, it left my hair feeling soft and full. I would try this product again.</li>
    <li> This Stuff Way Overpriced For Such A Small Bottle. Does Not Do As Described. If Anything Made My Head Itch More. Wife Said Same Thing. Don&#x27;t Waste Your Money!!!</li>
    <li> Does a good job at making an oily scalp feel clean. I ordered both the ME Plus and the regular, and in terms of cleaning power they were both equal. At first I used it daily, but it was overly drying. It would be okay if used in conjunction with the Emu oil conditioner all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Seabuckthorn Oil Shampoo from Blue Sage Naturals and that&#x27;s really the only shampoo that&#x27;s ever done anything for my scalp, so I&#x27;ll be ordering that again instead of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really helps keep my scalp feeling clean. If you have oily hair I highly reccommend this. I can&#x27;t rate this high enough.</li>
    <li> I thought this would fix my dandruff problem.  I have litterally tried everything on the market.  Including all the home remedies and getting a prescription shampoo.  Nothing has helped. This was kind of a last resort didn&#x27;t work for dandruff but made my hair nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> Easy on the scalp and cleared up some irritation I was having.  Read the technical reason this shampoo works or just use it and know that it just works well.</li>
    <li> We have been buying this product for our daughter for the past few years. Being able to purchase it through Amazon prime was an added bonus!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who get&#x27;s scalp cysts that sometimes are as large as a nickel. He also had an over production of sebum, and his hair follicles also would be clogged with oil and the hair would fall out and not grow back. After about a week and a half of daily use, the follicles weren&#x27;t clogged with oil anymore, and his scalp and hair weren&#x27;t oily anymore. The amount scalp cysts were cut in half too. He is about 3/4 done with the bottle, and while the follicles are still oil free, the cysts are back in full force. This shampoo is good if you have simple oily hair and clogged pores, but if you have any bumps or cysts, save your money and go to the doctor.</li>
    <li> I have fine, oily hair that can look oily by late afternoon if I use normal shampoo.  I do not have dandruff or itchy scalp.  This shampoo will kep my hair looking clean even through the next morning.  I have never had a problem with it irritating my scalp, but I don&#x27;t have scalp problems.  Normally, I rotate this shampoo with another healthy hair plus shampoo for oily hair.  I used to use the conditioner on the ends, but now I&#x27;ve switched to a spray of bamboo oil that reduces static and takes tangles right out without making my hair oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I tried everything once I stopped highlighting my hair.  I tried shampoos that were hugely expensive to dirt cheap ones.  Healthy Hait Plus shampoos are the only ones that helped me.  I wish eveyone searching for a solution good luck in finding the right shampoo for them</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my dad as a Christmas gift and he loved it. He always had psoriasis and recently had cancer which due to radiation and chemo caused him to lose some hair... since he always took pride in his hair (which is waist length and curly) it was depressing to see him so upset with his recent situation. I was on a mission to find a gentle shampoo. To say the least, I bought him some more for his birthday a few months later!!</li>
    <li> I have noticed no difference in this product than other products of a similar nature except the price is higher with this product.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Thank you for being so prompt.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a substitute for Nexxus Aloe Rid clarifying shampoo but this shampoo made my hair feel like straw. Can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
