<li> I bought it because I wanted long lasting wear</li>
<li> But it is difficult to tell the true color on the web</li>
<li> Pinker than I expected so</li>
<li> I gave it four stars only because the tube was a little different from what I purchase usually; just the tube, but not the lipstick itself.  </li>
<li> I thought the color is dark and will stay in for awhile</li>
<li> Tube was small, not a full sized lipstick.</li>
<li> not sure if i&#x27;ll buy this again...</li>
<li> Disappointed, but wasn&#x27;t going to the trouble of returning it.</li>
<li> Very very bad!  </li>
<li> Horrible purchase.</li>

    <li> Estee Lauder makes the absolute best lipstick. The smell is lovely, and the texture is great. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! Goes on smooth. Packaged well. I bought it because I wanted long lasting wear and it was supposed to be, but saying it lasts 20 min would be pushing it.</li>
    <li> I thought the color is dark and will stay in for awhile</li>
    <li> good medium &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; color for me</li>
    <li> I ordered Sugar Honey lipstick. I received Sugar Honey Shimmer. It was a gloss version of the lipstick I ordered.  Disappointed, but wasn&#x27;t going to the trouble of returning it.</li>
    <li> this lipstick is a very nice color, am happy with it, but it fades very quickly, needs to be reapplied often and what I don&#x27;t like is the taste of it.but its overall a nice purchase, not sure if i&#x27;ll buy this again...</li>
    <li> Nice product. Not the colour I ordered but this is pretty good. I uses it ofter. It last for a good while as well</li>
    <li> very nice, excellent product</li>
    <li> Color received was not what was listed. Tube was small, not a full sized lipstick. Doubt it true brand name lipstick. Horrible purchase.</li>

    <li> Very very bad!  The lipstick came without a case / box and the color does not look like the picture at all.</li>

    <li> I first saw this color on a friend, and thought it was lovely. Having ordered it for myself, I still love it. It really brightens up my face.</li>
    <li> Lipstick is just what I use.  I gave it four stars only because the tube was a little different from what I purchase usually; just the tube, but not the lipstick itself.  I will definitely try to purchase again.</li>
