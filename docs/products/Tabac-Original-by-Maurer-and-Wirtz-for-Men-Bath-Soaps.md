      <li>This product is very easy to lather and the smell is excellent.  </li>
      <li>this soap lathers up very nice and seems to protect your face.</li>
      <li>Mitchell&#x27;s produced more thought, and I suspect that men with a heavier beard could like that one best.  </li>
      <li>I bought this soap after reading many reviews on the best shave soap.</li>
      <li>It is a pleasant, somewhat old-fashioned, manly scent, and I like it.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, lathers beautifully and lubricates well.</li>
      <li>There are certainly good products in both categories.  </li>
      <li>Price is good also.</li>
      <li>It loads and lathers great and gives very smooth shave as well as good moisturizing.</li>
      <li>The Scent is mild and very pleasant!</li>

      <li>I love this shave soap!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I find the scent great, lathers easily and provides cushion and slickness needed.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great lathering, economical soap with a pleasant smell, too.</li>
      <li>Still.. from a purely utilitarian standpoint, it&#x27;s not the best value which is why I docked it one star.    </li>
      <li>This is an amazing soap.  </li>
      <li>Very creamy and with an excellent lather.    </li>
      <li>Nice lather, nice aroma, nice shave.</li>
      <li>(Van Der something or another).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac is best of 2 worlds, very protecting</li>
      <li>The soap makes a dense lather which means it&#x27;s holding lots of warm water on your face.</li>
      <li>It is creamy, smells good, and offers great long-standing lather with good lubrication.</li>
      <li>This may not necessarily be the best VALUE out there in terms of Shaving Soaps, but it is by far a top 3 if not THE BEST shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever experienced.. and believe me..</li>
      <li>It lathers up easily with a couple swirls with a good brush.</li>
      <li>This was just as advertized and by far the best shaving soap I have used.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Scent aside, Tabac will produce a rich and creamy lather that provides good glide and cushion.  </li>
      <li>This soap is awesome in all regards and is much superior to the other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very easily, has a nice smell, and helps with smooth shaving.</li>
      <li>Which is just fine because I still like a nice aftershave.  </li>
      <li>One puck will get you through the better part of a year.</li>
      <li>yes, it costs more than many brands, but it is more bang for the buck.</li>
      <li>This is the best soap I&#x27;ve purchased and don&#x27;t need to look any further.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is now my favorite shaving soap.</li>
      <li>The scent could be better, but it does the job.  </li>
      <li>If scent was better</li>
      <li>Most soaps don&#x27;t compete with creams for moisture and stability and lubrication.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.  </li>
      <li>Nice lightly lingering scent.  </li>
      <li>For more information, I suggest reading the badgerandblade forums.</li>
      <li>One of the healthy man magazines said that this soap should come with a copy of Penthouse.  </li>
      <li>Most of the soaps I have tried don&#x27;t compare to this.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite shave soap.  </li>
      <li>and this one is my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Shipping times were ok /average.</li>
      <li>always preferred the creams (my favorite is the bigelow from bath and body) because creams feel like they have better protection than the saop I tried</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
      <li>This is in my top 2 or 3 picks as a go to soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>In fact, when I needed more, I bought two.  </li>
      <li>However, both perform much better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>Outstanding product.</li>
      <li>I love this shaving soap.</li>
      <li>&quot; - &#x27;makes you look forward to using it every day:)  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this shaving soap. I used Col. Conk&#x27;s for a while, but it is a very dense soap and the lather was very tough to develop. This soap only takes a couple of swipes with a badger hair brush to get a good lather. I personally like the smell and so does my girlfriend, but it may not be for everyone. It is more of a \\&quot;classic shave\\&quot; smell if there is such a thing. Great stuff and worth the extra cost compared to cheaper soaps.</li>
    <li> This was my first shaving soap and it will be my last.  I bought this soap after reading many reviews on the best shave soap. I think the review on this soap that finally sold me was when they described the manly scent. This product is very easy to lather and the smell is excellent.  I do not see myself ever even trying another shave soap. Worth the cost. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve purchased and don&#x27;t need to look any further. This soap is awesome in all regards and is much superior to the other soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  You don&#x27;t don&#x27;t need to use any preshave oils or cremes and this soap makes your face very slick! 5 stars and then some!</li>
    <li> This all started because I hate going to Wal-Mart.     Wal-Mart is the only local retailer that stocks the little pucks of shaving soap that I use. Walgreens and CVS used to sell it but stopped. I was bemoaning having to go to Wal-Mart for a $1.25 item when my wife suggested trying Amazon. No Wal-Mart. No sales tax. No shipping thanks to Amazon Prime.     I typed \\&quot;shaving soap\\&quot; in the Amazon search box because I couldn&#x27;t remember the brand name I was looking for. Amazon came up with four pages of hits which included my cheap brand (van der Hagen) and even...(cue Wagnerian flourish)  Tabac.     Tabac is a German soap (milled, forged, and tempered until hard as Kruppstahl) that still proudly lists tallow as one of its ingredients. It has a mythic reputation and cult following among straight razor shavers. It has always been hard to find and expensive. Thanks to Amazon it is no longer hard to find. To be fair, Tabac is nowhere near as pricey as some of the English soaps which can go as high as $30 a puck.     Since I was already buying a lifetime supply of cheap soap (one dozen pucks) I was hesitant about dropping Tabac into my cart. I can&#x27;t afford to like this stuff and if I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;m out twelve bucks. But the impulsive devil on my shoulder prevailed. It&#x27;s German! Just like Beethoven, Ballistol, and Zyklon B!     Tabac comes in a four point four ounce puck that smells like pipe tobacco, leather, wood, and a hint of floral toilet bowl cleaner. My wife says it smells like a retired doctor. The soap makes a dense lather which means it&#x27;s holding lots of warm water on your face. It is very slippery and my Henckels Friodur glides over the skin like a feather. The fragrance from the lather has less of a toilet bowl note than when sniffing the dry puck directly.     Tabac gave an effortless and flawless shave without any drag or nicks. It does not dry before you&#x27;re done shaving. My newly shaved face felt newly shaved. In short, it works as well as the $1.25 stuff. Tabac does leave behind a greasy film (is this what they call hydrating?) which is slightly annoying and might be more so in hot and humid weather. I can only imagine that this grease is the tallow or sausage fat or whatever the Germans might be rendering into it.     On the plus side, Tabac leaves me smelling fresh like the Bavarian alps- ready to tackle the day or the Maginot Line. It is a triumph of marketing, fragrance over form, and the placebo effect.</li>
    <li> If you use shaving soap and have a large mug or bowl (2.75 inches in diameter or larger), this is great stuff.  Very creamy and with an excellent lather.    I got it to replace the Aramis that I had used for nearly 30 years.  If you are an Aramis user (the product has been discontinued), I would change to this in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other brands but this is by far my favorite. Nice lather, nice aroma, nice shave. It costs more initially than the others, but is a larger puck and lasts much longer.</li>
    <li> I went back to shaving with a double edge razor a few months ago. The shaving soap and brush makes all the difference. this soap lathers up very nice and seems to protect your face. I would recomend it highly.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smooth, clean shave!</li>
    <li> This is very good shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What that means is going to vary, depending on what you are used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a just starting out wet-shaving, and are only familiar with canned foams or gels, Tabac shaving soap can be a mind blowing experience that will leave you shaking your head at the marketing madness that led men to drop their shaving brushes and pick up the canned foam like lemmings heading to a cliff of mediocre shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the unlikely event you are a wet shaver with broad experience with luxury shaving soaps and creams but have yet to try this standard, Tabac will impress you as a good, solid product, and a fair value for the asking price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a soap and brush guy who has been limiting yourself to the US drugstore standbys of Williams and VDH, then Tabac will likely be an eye opening gateway soap that will leave you wondering, \\&quot;If this stuff is this good, what about the other products out there?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter who you are, Tabac&#x27;s unique scent will either delight or horrify you.  There seems to be little middle ground here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent aside, Tabac will produce a rich and creamy lather that provides good glide and cushion.  It isn&#x27;t the last word in slick or luxurious, but it&#x27;s certainly better than what you are going to find at the corner store, unless your corner store sells Taylor of Old Bond Street  or Art of shaving soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is forgiving enough that hitting just the right mix of water and product isn&#x27;t as critical as with some other soaps, doesn&#x27;t require a lot of finesse or effort to get good results, and works well with both badger and boar brushes.  The lather comes quickly, easily, and in satisfying volume, and it doesn&#x27;t quickly become dry while on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen the scent described variously as clean and soapy, floral, like an ashtray and like an old person&#x27;s dresser.  I find myself strangely attracted to it, to the point where I bought the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac is one of those \\&quot;must try\\&quot; products for those interested in what wet shaving is all about.</li>
    <li> This is my preferred shaving soap bar none, because it works the way a shaving soap is SUPPOSED to - no \\&quot;coaxing\\&quot;, you hit it with a wet brush and it explodes into a thick, slippery lather.  And that&#x27;s why you buy a shaving soap instead of the canned goop, right?  I&#x27;m a tough shaver, with stubborn hairs of both beard and head that lie nearly flat, but Tabac holds them so well with its thickness I get a smooth shave even with just one against-the-grain pass.  Slip(glide) is good, just use the proper amount of water as any shaving soap needs, and moisturizing is no problem either - I myself just do a cold rinse afterward, with no after product.  If you like scents, you&#x27;ll really like this, because it&#x27;s a pretty strong floral, with noticeable lavender, kind of \\&quot;classic barbershop\\&quot; - &#x27;makes you look forward to using it every day:)  If you&#x27;ve liked other tallow soaps, I highly recommend you try this.  \\&quot;Tabac, za zuperia Cherman shaving zoap - you vill like it!\\&quot;  LOL</li>
    <li> The other reviews don&#x27;t kid around about the amount of lather this cake puts out. My only complaints about this shave soap are minor.  The smell is very generic and when you are done shaving and rinse you face, the smell is all gone. Which is just fine because I still like a nice aftershave.  The other complaint is really silly.  I think the cake is HUGE.  I put it into my shave mug and it only went about an inch in.  I took my knife and shaved the rim to make it fit the bottom of the mug.  Then I had to cut up the remaining strips for the top, and microwave the whole thing to make it soft so I could push it in easier. Overall it is a great soap and I do recommend it, just be aware it is a lot of soap with a ton of lather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for a year now, and besides the initial soap that came with it - I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a soap that can put up a good lather that isn&#x27;t in a can or tube.  This is by far the best I have tried so far - and with 2 (huge) soaps now, it will be a long time till I try another brand.  Smells great, lathers quickly and thick.  Big thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through at least two pucks of this soap and it smells and lathers great. Lasts a long time, too. However, this price is way too high. I can order it from England for about $16.00 shipped.</li>
    <li> Tabac shaving soap is a bit pricey but well worth it. It seems like it is going to last forever and the smell is very manly. It lathers up easily with a couple swirls with a good brush. I would recommend this product to any wet shave enthusiast. 5 stars</li>
    <li> Just an ordinary shavin soap</li>
    <li> This was a decent shave soap.  I will be going back to burts bee&#x27;s bay rum though.  Best I have used to date.</li>
    <li> Bought a puck of this after reading the reviews. I shave with a straight razor &amp; I take my time, but more often than not the stuff just dries on my face and flakes off- leaving no lubrication qualities as the razor glides along.  The soap appears not to have clay in it, which most other brush soaps do....  I do like the smell, considering how to modify the soap so it does not dry on my face.</li>
    <li> Tabac is a great shaving soap for us blade shavers.</li>
    <li> Produces profuse lather.  Scent a little pronounced when first unwrapped but it settles down nicely.  I like the scent so much I bought a bottle of the Tabac aftershave.</li>
    <li> I waited until I had completely used up the whole puck before sitting down to review this product. The first shaving soap I used when switching to brush and mug was a nice Italian soap that was clearly poured into a bowl while still liquid/molten. That soap lasted me almost 8 months but the quality of the lather deteriorated in the last two months. I wanted to see how long this Tabac soap lasted and how it performed right to the bitter end. I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This solid, hand-filling puck (it&#x27;s bigger than many other top brands) lasted me a full 12 months almost to the day. And that&#x27;s shaving 7 days a week. The rich lather whips up with almost no effort and it is the creamiest and most lubricating product I&#x27;ve ever used. The razor glides smoothly and this soap never leaves my skin feeling dry. The last mug full of lather was just as luxuriant as the first. The quality of this soap is consistently superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the scent of this soap seems strong when it&#x27;s first unwrapped. It was not a familiar scent to me, but at the same time it smelled \\&quot;appropriate\\&quot; if I may use that word. It is a pleasant, somewhat old-fashioned, manly scent, and I like it. Though the scent seemed strong at first, it never seemed strong in use. No one ever commented on the scent so it&#x27;s clearly not offensive. My wife would have said something if it were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering how good this soap is and how long it lasts, it is an exceptional value for the money. I most heartily recommend it to any man who wants a great traditional wet shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Received my order of two pucks. Upon opening the box the aroma was strong.enough to give me a headache.  However, upon advice of a friend I gave it a try, and boy, I&#x27;m glad I did! Once the package was opened the aroma mellowed and when the brush hit the soap the lather was great.  I&#x27;m a dedicated wet-shaver and as such have several different soaps that I like to use, Tabac.will definitely be added to my shaving rotation!</li>
    <li> Hubby really loves this soap as do I. Leaves him nice and smooth, had to buy myself one to use for my legs and arms!!</li>
    <li> The local big $$ department store charges an arm and a leg for replacement soap bowl refills.  My wife found this and ordered it for me as a gift.  Loved it!    In fact, when I needed more, I bought two.  It lasts a good long time, lathers up well, and the wife really goes for the old fashioned smell!    I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> I love this shave soap! This stuff lathers great and provides such a smooth shave. I&#x27;ve also used Colonel Conks shave soap and Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Street Avocado shaving cream, and hands down, Tabac is my favorite. I&#x27;ve probably used this soap 50-60 times, and at least 80% of the puck is still left, if not more. It lasts forever. Great product for the money. Even if you&#x27;re not into wet shaving, this soap can be used with great effectiveness. Although I would encourage anyone who isn&#x27;t wet shaving to try it. It makes shaving fun, not a chore, and gives awesome results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  I give it three thumbs up.  Lots of other shaving soaps out there but this is one I keep coming back to.  Price is good also.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff, great shave. Definitely my favorite, has that old school smell I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I am not a shaving afficianado, and have been using shaving soap for about 8 months.  This soap is my first experiment with the \\&quot;better\\&quot; quality soap.  The other soap I have used is the inexpensive product from WalMart.  I am using a Gilette Trac II blade and a boar brush.       I don&#x27;t have much time, so my comments will be brief.  The lather from this shaving soap is phenomenal, but it leaves my face somewhat dry.  I can easily see why folks really love this soap, but I have gradually migrated back towards the Wal Mart shaving soap because it has more glycerin and leaves my face more moist.  For more information, I suggest reading the badgerandblade forums.</li>
    <li> This stuff is one of the best shaving soaps I have ever tried. It smells great (in a kind of 70&#x27;s way) and performance is awesome. I get a great comfortable close shave, and my skin feels very soft afterwords.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing soap.  It provides great cushion and slickness and has that great Tabac scent.  If you are even thinking that you might want this item, I highly suggest you go for it.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a mug, soap, and brush, and a good old fashioned double edge razor (like Grandpa used) since I was old enough to shave- we&#x27;ll say about 35 years... I was using Williams mug soap for most of those years, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that soap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great lathering, economical soap with a pleasant smell, too. Real Americana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During some internet searching for some double edge razor blades, I found lots of other shaving related stuff I had never heard of, as well. There are hundreds of shaving soaps available these days, in every flavor you can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way I could try even a small percentage of them all, so based on some shaving forum recommendations, I bought the Tabac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now my favorite shaving soap. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you...yes, it costs more than many brands, but it is more bang for the buck. It is actually very long lasting (read: economical) makes a great, slippery lather, and has an \\&quot;old days\\&quot; smell that I really enjoy. Not like a 100 year old guy smell, but it reminds me of old-time barber shop smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell so much, that I got the Tabac after shave lotion, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that smell is subjective, and as is the case with anything, you may not like it. But an easy workaround to that would be to simply buy it, try it, and if you don&#x27;t like it you can sell it on the shaving forums. No, I am NOT kidding!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving soap period.  I have tried 8-10 brands before finally trying this one on the premise it is the benchmark shaving soap.  The smell is perfect, and it is so good I no longer use any shaving oil.  One puck usually lasts me a full year so do yourself a favor and try it.  I just wish Tabac&#x27;s other products were more widely available.</li>
    <li> This may not necessarily be the best VALUE out there in terms of Shaving Soaps, but it is by far a top 3 if not THE BEST shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever experienced.. and believe me.. this soap IS an experience!    The Tabac Puck is slightly larger than most other shaving soaps out there. At 4.4 Oz, it&#x27;s probably 50-75% larger than other shaving soaps on average. Still.. from a purely utilitarian standpoint, it&#x27;s not the best value which is why I docked it one star.    The Lather created by Tabac is incomparable to other soaps.. a few swirls and \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; of the brush on the puck and I am able to create enough Lather for at least 3 shaving passes! The Lather is thick and creamy and, coupled with a nice brush, applies evenly without slopping or dripping. The Lather is extremely slick and allows the razor to glide right over the skin while cutting down the growth in its path.    The Scent is mild and very pleasant! It doesn&#x27;t overpower and the fragrance used does not irritate the nose or react to the skin. (I also enjoyed the scent so much that I purchased the Aftershave as well.)    After shaving, the soap rinses off cleanly and leaves no residue. Tabac leaves the skin relatively well moisturized. I can even get away with not using aftershave or balm when using Tabac!    Yeah, it&#x27;s expensive, but the enjoyment you get will far outweigh the extra bucks you spend!</li>
    <li> Whips up to a nice dense lather in a reasonable time.  I shave with this at least 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> This was just as advertized and by far the best shaving soap I have used.  It also fit into my non-traditional shaving mug</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift. The smell isn&#x27;t as strong as the internet made me believe. It smells a bit powdery,  and it is strong, but not like a terrible 1970s gigalo. It does lather very thick, which was actually a downside according the the recipient, but ymmv. After buying this I found the refill sticks of  the same soap are less expensive, if you are willing to shave it into your cup check them out. Shipping times were ok /average.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and it was a big hit!  The fragrance was perfect and I understand the lather was amazing.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shave soap.  It&#x27;s soft, lathers thick, and it produces a wonderful lather.  It&#x27;s not too expensive either, and the scent is deep and masculine.  I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Great lather, great skin protection. Scent is way too strong for me though so four stars.</li>
    <li> One of the healthy man magazines said that this soap should come with a copy of Penthouse.  That got my attention.  The negatives seem to be that the scent is strong.  As for me, I&#x27;m done shopping.  This does it for me.  Lathers up well, just the right amount of slick and I enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> Just like most reviewers,  I have found this to be very user friendly and is in the top 3 including Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat and How to Grow a Mustache soaps.  Nice lightly lingering scent.  Great shave!!</li>
    <li> Makes an outstanding lather for a really great shave.  The scent could be better, but it does the job.  I would definitely buy Tabac again.</li>
    <li> An admission:  I&#x27;m a converted tabacaholic.  I&#x27;ve used a number of soaps (I&#x27;ve always generally favored them over creams for a number of reasons).  I like some cheap soaps;  I like some expensive soaps.  There are certainly good products in both categories.  And then there&#x27;s this stuff.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, but I can see why so many people swear this is the last soap they will ever use.  This stuff reminds me of Mitchell&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s that soft, but the lather isn&#x27;t quite as fluffy.  Maybe wetter or greasier.  It has an interesting smell which has developed a bit of a reputation.  I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s meant to smell like tobacco flowers (hence tabac)- some people like it, some HATE it, but I would urge you to try it if that&#x27;s your only hangup.  When I first tried this soap I myself thought the smell was interesting:  a sort of leathery, horsey smell- maybe even borderline offensive at first, but despite the fact that it grows on you it also mellows as you shave with it a few times.  As for the smell itself what can I say?  It smells of rich mahogany and leather-bound books.. No, i don&#x27;t know.  There&#x27;s definitely a spicy, floral character.  If it doesn&#x27;t grow on you you&#x27;ll probably want to sell it off because, as many high quality soaps, the essence sort of sticks with you a bit.  In fact, this soap leaves a really soft sheen behind for hours (must be the tallow).  It&#x27;s actually quite pleasurable.. This puck is quite large, triple milled, and as such it lasts quite awhile.  I can go through a van der hagen (or other comparable supermarket soap) in a month or less.  This will maybe last me five or six months using it alone.  Maybe longer.. It&#x27;s really one of maybe 5 shaving products I think everyone should try at least once.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this is the best shave soap ever.  Lathers easily, reduces irritation,and I love the scent.  My wife thinks it smells like a grandpa though.  I still use it and love it.  One puck lasts me about 10 months.  So I save money o. Shaving cream.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shave soap.  It seems a bit pricy for soap, but his last jar lasted him at least two years, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely a great product, the best shave soap that I have used.  It is still more expensive then the routine ones you can buy at the store, but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe there is a real difference in shaving soap, but there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac lathers quickly and gets the job done better than the other shaving soap I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac makes a positive difference.</li>
    <li> The scent may be a bit off-putting; it seems to polarize a bit.performance-wise, this one of the best dollar-for-dollar soaps you can get. Thick, slick, cushioning lather is your reward for the right water-soap ratio. Just start with a good brush, and a little water at a time, adding 1/2 teaspoon or so until you get the lather you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased at least 5 refills since buying my original Tabac soap puck and white jar of Tabac.  This is a winner in most wet shavers shave dens.  If you&#x27;ve never tried a tallow (beef fat) shave cream, try this one...it&#x27;s one of the best.  Some (shave forums) object to the scent.  I would classify it as heavy woods, spice.  It&#x27;s a masculine scent though detractors would say it smells like grandma&#x27;s purse.  I say fooey and heartily give this one a strong 5 star rating, not just for the enjoyable scent but also for the thick lather it easily builds though a generous amount of water is needed IMO when building a lather.  Typically I let water puddle on top of the puck for awhile before swirling my brush on top (of the puck).  I&#x27;ll shake the water out of the brush but I like the puck to be damp before loading my shave brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.  Although I have been wet shaving for only 7 years, and have tried many shave soaps, including but not limited to very good artisan shave soaps, I have used and purchased Tabac more than any other shave soap.  I believe it’s truly the best around.  Others may have better and different ideas</li>
    <li> awesome soap. great lather, classy scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tabac off and on for several years. It smells nice, lathers beautifully and lubricates well. I may try other soaps from time to time, but this is my go-to. I haven&#x27;t rally kept track, but I&#x27;d say it lasts for close to a year.</li>
    <li> With only 6 to 8 passes on the soap with my brush lathers up great and has long lasting scent. It even makes my bathroom smell like the barber shop I used to go to 30 years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a mug and brush for over forty years, and have never thought of doing otherwise.  I always thought the soap choices were limited to the inexpensive varieties found in drug stores and some department stores.  My wife purchased shaving soap from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn several years ago, which I thought was a huge improvement.  On a whim, I searched the web and found really helpful reviews on luxury shaving soaps.  I settled on Tabac Original and Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Far Shaving Soap, neither of which are cheap.  What a surprise!  Tabac has a great, almost intoxicating scent, and does not leave my skin dry and tight.  In fact, I have stopped using after shave as it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary.  I&#x27;ve NEVER had my skin feel so supple after shaving.  I saw in one of the other reviews that Tabac makes an after shave, which I&#x27;ll order as well.  As for Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shave Soap, it&#x27;s everything the description says.  It&#x27;s hard to say which one of these two exceptional products is superior.  Despite what I read about difficulty with lather, using a badger brush and hot water out of the tap, I found it quick and easy with both to produce more than ample lather.  Mitchell&#x27;s produced more thought, and I suspect that men with a heavier beard could like that one best.  Mitchell&#x27;s left my face in great shape, with absolutely no dryness.  The scent is very clean, and compared to Tabac, relatively unscented.  However, both perform much better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used so it really comes done to one&#x27;s personal preference.  While more expensive than Williams and other brands, from what I can tell after a few weeks, these soaps will last for months, and for me, that will be a good value.</li>
    <li> Classic soap just works.  Was worried because of all the comments online about the scent.  I find the scent great, lathers easily and provides cushion and slickness needed.  Only regret is I didn&#x27;t buy it in the tub.</li>
    <li> I tried creams and soaps before this one (the only soap I tried was the cheap one from walmart, which wasn&#x27;t bad for a couple of $ a puck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always preferred the creams (my favorite is the bigelow from bath and body) because creams feel like they have better protection than the saop I tried (Van Der something or another).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tabac is best of 2 worlds, very protecting and it&#x27;s a soup so not too thick and so allows (IMO) for a closer shave. YMMV</li>
    <li> Anyone reading evaluations of shaving products knows that everything is subjective and YMMV.  Disclaimer out of the way - let&#x27;s jump in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product quickly produces a rich foam lather when paired with a badger hair brush.  The lather holds for long enough to not need to re-lather the other half of your face while shaving.  Cared a lot for this characteristic.  I also don&#x27;t feel chapped or dry after washing it off.  Aces 10 for a high quality product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is the fragrance they&#x27;ve opted to use. While I realize the package specifies sandalwood, often times it is accompanied by other characteristics that add to the masculinity element. I found I&#x27;m overpowered by the smell of sandalwood and while bearable, will push me to explore product options for something either better accompanied, less fragrant, or different smelling.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Merz Apothecary in Chicago for $22.00 plus tax. Merz is the brick-and-mortar for Smallflower here on Amazon. What a great soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent. Great lather. Great slickness. Great shave. I will buy this again. It is now part of my regular rotation.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I never thought shaving  soap could make such a difference. Outstanding product.</li>
    <li> Having been a wet shaver for all my life (50+years), I have used dozens if not more soaps. This is in my top 2 or 3 picks as a go to soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like a scented soap and this one is my favorite scent. In the lather department , it shines. Very lubricating and thick it will not disappoint. As far as value, while costing a bit more than the Walmart varieties, It will last every bit as long or longer. Being that it gives a better quality of lather and scent, you will not go back.</li>
    <li> I really like the product and have been using it for several years.  It goes on very easily, has a nice smell, and helps with smooth shaving.</li>
    <li> This soap is brilliant.  Great lather.  Lasts forever (i shave three times a week and my first Tabac puck lasted about a year).  The scent is just perfect.  Think aged leather, fresh oats and bourbon.  Refined, subtle and masculine.  That&#x27;s what I like about it- it has an \\&quot;act like you&#x27;ve been there\\&quot; vibe to it.</li>
    <li> Best lather of soaps I have tried.  Highly recommend.  Scent is not my favorite, but it fades fairly quickly into the day.  It does not stop me from buying it again and again.</li>
    <li> I shave with double edge safety razors, badger brush and a variety of soaps and creams.I buy a lot of different soaps. I keep the ones I like and toss the ones I don&#x27;t. So far this is the #1 shave soap I have tried. It is creamy, smells good, and offers great long-standing lather with good lubrication. I don&#x27;t need a whole lot of soap on the brush to lather up multiple times. It is worth the extra money, as it will work well and last a long long time.  Most of the soaps I have tried don&#x27;t compare to this.  Most soaps don&#x27;t compete with creams for moisture and stability and lubrication. This one is very competitive with creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**edit 2013 summer**&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it as much as when I wrote this. I will not be buying this one again. It&#x27;s not creamy and luby after time.</li>
    <li> My favorite shave soap. Protects the skin, minimizing cuts. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> This has very quickly become one of my favorite soaps.  Tabac just flat out smells awesome--a little smoke, a little sweet, a little of something almost indescribable.  The scent strength might very well be the strongest of any shaving soap on the market, and it lingers on the skin for quite a while.  As if all that wasn&#x27;t enough, the soap is a top performer.  It make a very slick lather, and it was pretty easy to lather up.  You can pay a little extra and get the very nice ceramic bowl, but if you just want to try the soap, this is a great option.</li>
    <li> It lasts forever and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Lathers well.  Did not fit in my shave mug but cut down the sides and placed them on top.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap but I didn&#x27;t like scent. It loads and lathers great and gives very smooth shave as well as good moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t burn skin like others have. If scent was better I give it five stars but not.</li>
    <li> Unlike that cheap crap you can buy at the local grocer, Tabac is a perfect lather every time.  Smells like an old man--in a good way.  One puck will get you through the better part of a year.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product!</li>
