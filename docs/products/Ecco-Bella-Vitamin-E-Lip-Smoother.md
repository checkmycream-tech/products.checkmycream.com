      <li>but I think I would like this lipstick in another color better.</li>
      <li>The color, &amp; the fact that it was Uten Free, was what prompted me to buy this lipstick!</li>
      <li>I use ECCO BELLA and love the fact that there are no harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more oily than one would expect and therefore doesn&#x27;t stay.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>More oily than I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>I loved the actual product, great color, smooth</li>
      <li>It is really nice on it&#x27;s own but the pink with it looks great.</li>
      <li>It makes my lips feel healthy and it is light, and not over done.</li>
      <li>Love the color, it just enhances the original color of your lips.</li>

      <li>It glides on smoothly and feels sleek and weightless.  </li>
      <li>The ingredient list on the website (\\&quot;IMPORTANT INFORMATION: INGREDIENTS\\&quot;) does not list any animal-derived ingredient.</li>
      <li>Safe ingredients, pretty color,</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth although comes off pretty easily.</li>
      <li>Great little lipstick thus far - glides on smoothly,  color stands out more than expected (Rhubarb), and stays on for a couple of hours before needing to reapply (not the best staying power but it held up for a bit).  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the service and love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>Very hydrating and super cute-</li>
      <li>It is soft, the color is perfect for me all day and the center works so well.</li>
      <li>The lip smoother works great, but just have to apply it a few times during the day.</li>
      <li>I really like the color!</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t ordered any other kind of lip product since finding this, and it&#x27;s gluten-free.</li>
      <li>Nice natural color and doesn&#x27;t feel dry on my lips.</li>
      <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t really do it justice though.</li>
      <li>This lipstick doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips and has a very nice subtle color, not too bold.  </li>
      <li>but I ended up getting more of a dark red/wine color.</li>
      <li>This lipstick is really nice with the extra center of moisture inside it.  </li>
      <li>I am aware of carmine as an ingredient in many cosmetics ( shades of pink, red,</li>
      <li>/&gt;do not waste your money on this product ...</li>
      <li>The first one I got was probably underway too long in transit.</li>
      <li>My lips stay soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>major problem that I have had for years, is that all lipsticks irritate my lips, &amp; the skin peals!...</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to gluten/wheat and was unaware of how much gluten is used in cosmetics, especially in lipstick.  </li>
      <li>The price is along the lines of top brand lipsticks, so why pay those other companies for a product with unknown, and possibly harmful,  ingredients?</li>
      <li>Strong enough to be noticed but still subtle enough to not be overpowering.  </li>
      <li>only is this misleading for those that prefer an animal-free product, but also for those with allergies where this could present a major health problem.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>

<li> but it broke off in the base of the tube the 2nd day :(</li>
<li> It is not only ugly, it is very painful!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There was only a little bit of product in the tube. Arrived on time. More oily than I&#x27;d like. But the price was awesome!</li>
    <li> I am updating this to a 5 star product. The first one I got was probably underway too long in transit. The one I have now is wonderful - it is winter and the Vit E in the center is great for keeping my lips from getting chapped - best winter product. I get color and protection all in one. It is soft, the color is perfect for me all day and the center works so well. I will be ordering another when I am out!</li>
    <li> Rhubarb is a good gloss type lipstick as there isn&#x27;t a lot of pigmentation/color. It matches my lips perfectly and gives a nice sheen. The vitamin E makes my lips feel velvety smooth. I like it but I think I would like this lipstick in another color better.</li>
    <li> I use ECCO BELLA and love the fact that there are no harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great lipstick and beautiful color</li>
    <li> Thanks for the service and love this lipstick.</li>
    <li> The color, &amp; the fact that it was Uten Free, was what prompted me to buy this lipstick!... How long does it last? Silch!&lt;br /&gt;The major problem that I have had for years, is that all lipsticks irritate my lips, &amp; the skin peals!... It is not only ugly, it is very painful! I only wore it once, but it felt great on my lips. My advice: IF you decide to buy it, take it with you + a small mirror, so that you can re-apply it freequently!!!⭐️⭐️😳</li>
    <li> This color is perfect!  My lips stay soft and moisturized.  Tends to bleed a little.  Use a primer to helps with the bleeding</li>
    <li> Product as described. Applies on lips smoothly and lasts for a while. Nice tint not too strong and  moisturises well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. Perfect for every day wear and is a perfect nude. Very hydrating and super cute- I ordered it for all my friends. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t ordered any other kind of lip product since finding this, and it&#x27;s gluten-free.</li>
    <li> This color is nice, it is not overpowering.  Ecco Bella Rhubarb smoother gives lips moisture and a pretty subtle color.</li>
    <li> Nice natural color and doesn&#x27;t feel dry on my lips. I put this color on then use a pink color on my lower lip. It is really nice on it&#x27;s own but the pink with it looks great. Also, the fact that it is not full of toxic chemicals sealed the deal for me.</li>

Other than the surprise in color I still like it. It goes on smooth although comes off pretty easily. Other than that it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
    <li> I use this especially when I am out in the dry air.  Keeps its color quite well.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> Great little lipstick thus far - glides on smoothly,  color stands out more than expected (Rhubarb), and stays on for a couple of hours before needing to reapply (not the best staying power but it held up for a bit).  It is a bit pricey though, so I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> a horrid product, the thin plastic packaging gets stuck, cannot twist open ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;an unevolved color, product, and packaging ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not waste your money on this product ...</li>
    <li> This is a great vitamin E moisturizer for your lips with a hint of color! This feels so good!!  I like that there are not a lot of harsh chemicals in the products!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is really nice with the extra center of moisture inside it.  It goes on smooth and is a great color.  It makes my lips feel healthy and it is light, and not over done.</li>
    <li> I hovered between two stars and three. Safe ingredients, pretty color, but it&#x27;s more oily than one would expect and therefore doesn&#x27;t stay.  If it were reformulated to be slightly waxier it would be more effective in protecting and enhancing lips. Sometimes I wonder how products get to the marketing stage.</li>
    <li> I loved the actual product, great color, smooth texture- but it broke off in the base of the tube the 2nd day :(</li>
    <li> It was received and the lipstick was broken at the bottom and I had to realign it to use product.  It glides on smoothly and feels sleek and weightless.  Love the color!</li>
    <li> I just received my order of Ecco Bella Vitamin E Lip Smoother in Rhubarb, sold by and shipped from Amazon, LLC.&lt;br /&gt;This product is described as \\&quot;VEGAN\\&quot; per the \\&quot;DESCRIPTION AND DETAILS\\&quot;. The ingredient list on the website (\\&quot;IMPORTANT INFORMATION: INGREDIENTS\\&quot;) does not list any animal-derived ingredient. The product ingredient label on  the tube lists \\&quot;CARMINE\\&quot;, which is animal derived and not vegan. I am aware of carmine as an ingredient in many cosmetics ( shades of pink, red, plum).&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this misleading for those that prefer an animal-free product, but also for those with allergies where this could present a major health problem. I am sending it back.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to gluten/wheat and was unaware of how much gluten is used in cosmetics, especially in lipstick.  This lipstick doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips and has a very nice subtle color, not too bold.  I really love it.</li>
    <li> The lip smoother works great, but just have to apply it a few times during the day. Love the color, it just enhances the original color of your lips. The price is along the lines of top brand lipsticks, so why pay those other companies for a product with unknown, and possibly harmful,  ingredients? will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This last about half as long as the Dr. Hauschka lipstick I have used for years. It does moisturize, however.  And the Rhubarb color is a nice tone.  Strong enough to be noticed but still subtle enough to not be overpowering.  Will buy again.</li>
