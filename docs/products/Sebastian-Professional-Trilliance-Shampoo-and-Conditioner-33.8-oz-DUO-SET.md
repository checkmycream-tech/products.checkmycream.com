      <li>I am so glad I found this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner in the history of hair products.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I Love it</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I had ordered Sebastian before and fell in love with it..</li>
      <li>This is great shampoo and conditioner for soft shiny hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair extremely soft and smells great.  </li>
      <li>good price and fast shipping</li>
      <li>My hair its very soft and has a good smell all week.  </li>
      <li>Great lite daily shampoo!</li>
      <li>, it didn&#x27;t make my hair soft and smooth as good conditioners should do.</li>
      <li>My hair is subjected to high heat (blowdryer and flat iron) and these two combined do the job of keeping my hair looking awesome.</li>
      <li>She asked how it was and noted that often the products sold online have thickeners added to the original product.</li>
      <li>It smells so good and makes my hair super soft and full of life.</li>
      <li>Great product if your hair needs are minimal.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair clean and super shiny.  </li>
      <li>, I got no frizz, hair lasts clean for a long time and it feels really nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I love how soft and silky my hair feels after it&#x27;s been washed.</li>
      <li>The only downside to me is that they should improve the scent of the shampoo and conditioner to something more unique.</li>
      <li>That is absolutely right for me.</li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a major difference in the shine of my hair, but my hair is pretty healthy and shiny to begin with.  </li>
      <li>I did not think much of it at first, though noticed my hair did not finish as well using the online product.</li>
      <li>This was consistent with what I noticed.</li>
      <li>light-reflecting surface for gorgeous natural shine and the perfect styling base.</li>
      <li>Used to get the smaller bottles from the salon, but these bigger bottles are much more economical!</li>
      <li>Over continued usage has really helped my texture on my curly hair.  </li>
      <li>What can I say except Sebastian is high quality hair products!  </li>
      <li>However, the shampoo and conditioner I purchased online is much thicker than the salon product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and tried to switch to cheaper stuff to save money, but quickly decided this is not where I should cut back.</li>
      <li>his fur is very soft!</li>
      <li>I love sebastian shampoos - but for me this one was a bit drying and too harsh on the hair compared to the others.</li>
      <li>I was nervous ordering offline, but it came well packaged and looks, feels, smells like normal</li>
      <li>Really like this shampoo, but it feels a little heavier on my hair than the Sebastian Light.  </li>
      <li>If I do not have Lanza, I will turn to Sebastian products, however I have very curly hair and many regions have hard water or chemically treated water.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair luxuriously soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>My hair can get frizzy so it doesn&#x27;t completely take away the frizz</li>
      <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s really adding that much more shine to my hair (maybe a little bit), but any product that can manage my coarse hair is better than average!</li>
      <li>It is not a heavy shampoo, so if you&#x27;re used to keratin or awapuhi products, this is very similar.  </li>
      <li>Even after using a flat iron and hair products my hairs still feels soft and is manageable.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many kinds of Shampoo and Conditioners and it is very difficult to find one that really works</li>

    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. It has a great clean smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. It leaves my hair luxuriously soft and shiny. I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> Love this product and am so happy to find it without searching stores, arrived promptly and in excellent condition. This product was used on my hair for an event where I was the &amp;#34;hair model&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since! Leaves hair shiny, healthy and static free!</li>
    <li> Great product if there is a water softener or good water as in NYC or mountain water. Great product if your hair needs are minimal. If I do not have Lanza, I will turn to Sebastian products, however I have very curly hair and many regions have hard water or chemically treated water.&lt;br /&gt;Great shipping - less than 5 days. NICE</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo/conditioner. I wash my hair everyday and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Used to get the smaller bottles from the salon, but these bigger bottles are much more economical!</li>
    <li> Bought this on my mom&#x27;s recommendation, who is a hairdresser. I love this shampoo! I had some damaged hair from a different shampoo and after just a few times of using this, my hair is soft and shiny. And it smells sooo good! I was nervous ordering offline, but it came well packaged and looks, feels, smells like normal so I don&#x27;t think there is any additives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not fond of the smell of both products. My hair seems to be fuzzier and dryer than my previous product.</li>
    <li> The best hair product I&#x27;ve every used.</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner is the best thing since sliced bread... seriously, I don&#x27;t do ANYTHING to my hair and since I started using these products, I got no frizz, hair lasts clean for a long time and it feels really nice.</li>
    <li> I like most Sebastian products and this one is no exception. Not sure if it&#x27;s really adding that much more shine to my hair (maybe a little bit), but any product that can manage my coarse hair is better than average! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the conditioner is not as thick as I&#x27;m used to with the Drench and Penetraitt conditioners and doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate my hair as much.</li>
    <li> Great lite daily shampoo! I have loved all of the Sebastian products I have used!</li>
    <li> This hair products are awesome. My hair its very soft and has a good smell all week.  5 5 5</li>
    <li> I love sebastian shampoos - but for me this one was a bit drying and too harsh on the hair compared to the others. Smells wonderful though!</li>
    <li> Great for colored hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it for years and tried to switch to cheaper stuff to save money, but quickly decided this is not where I should cut back. It&#x27;s worth every penny. I have thick, very wavy hair and it makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Great set up. I have short hair. And to be honest, I do not see the difference between shampoo wella or schwarzkopf. But do not get worse. And given the price I can safely say that the purchase was good.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this shampoo and conditioner. I adore it! Not too moisturizing, but not too drying. Just right. Keeps my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Love! Works so nicely, is light but very effective. Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I typically purchase the Sebastian Trilliant shampoo and conditioner at my salon when they run a sale. I decided to try ordering it online. The bottles I received are identical to the ones I purchased at the salon. The scent of the shampoo and conditioner are the same as the salon purchased product. However, the shampoo and conditioner I purchased online is much thicker than the salon product. I did not think much of it at first, though noticed my hair did not finish as well using the online product. I had an appt with my hairdresser last week and told her that I purchased the shampoo and conditioner online. She asked how it was and noted that often the products sold online have thickeners added to the original product. This was consistent with what I noticed. Thus, I would not purchase this again as thickeners were obviously added.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this shampoo and conditioner. I love how soft and silky my hair feels after it&#x27;s been washed. Even after using a flat iron and hair products my hairs still feels soft and is manageable. My hair can get frizzy so it doesn&#x27;t completely take away the frizz but I am able to control it better than before. For the price it&#x27;s a good sized container and I know it will last awhile.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner set!</li>
    <li> good price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and daughters!&lt;br /&gt;They say the difference to the common shampoo is great!&lt;br /&gt;Use hidden them to wash my dog ​​and his fur is very soft! kkkkk</li>
    <li> Been using over 5 years started based ib hairstylist recommending it. What can I say except Sebastian is high quality hair products!  Over continued usage has really helped my texture on my curly hair.  Leaves your hair extremely soft and smells great.  It may seem expensive but takes a small amount therefore lasts a long time. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found on this shampoo. After some severe damage to my hair, this shampoo and conditioner has helped minimize the breakage.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner in the history of hair products.  It leaves my hair clean and super shiny.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot either.  It is not a heavy shampoo, so if you&#x27;re used to keratin or awapuhi products, this is very similar.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  And you can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo, but it feels a little heavier on my hair than the Sebastian Light.  I just learned to adjust the amount of conditioner I use with this one to make it work. :)  I haven&#x27;t noticed a major difference in the shine of my hair, but my hair is pretty healthy and shiny to begin with.  I guess I just wanted it to sparkle...lol</li>
    <li> This set is a great buy, leaves your hair so clean, soft &amp; with an awesome shine, no matter how damaged your hair is!</li>
    <li> This item was for my wife who had tried it from one of her friends. She is very happy with it and will purchase it again. Thank you for the query.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. That is absolutely right for me. My hair looks very good. light-reflecting surface for gorgeous natural shine and the perfect styling base.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo and conditioner for soft shiny hair. The price and delivery was great too!</li>
    <li> What an amazing shampoo and conditioner set! It smells so good and makes my hair super soft and full of life. Will never use any other brand!!</li>
    <li> These are some of my favorite beauty products for years! My hair is subjected to high heat (blowdryer and flat iron) and these two combined do the job of keeping my hair looking awesome. The only downside to me is that they should improve the scent of the shampoo and conditioner to something more unique. Smells like Trè Semme...</li>
    <li> I love my Sebastian Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. I had ordered Sebastian before and fell in love with it.. this is my second time ordering and I will order another pair for my daughter.. Great for your hair, it really does work, it smells great and your hair stays smooth.</li>
    <li> I use Sebastian Penetraitt Shampoo and Conditioner and I Love it so I thought I would try the Trillliance line of Sebastian Shampoo and Conditioner and I was disappointed, it didn&#x27;t make my hair soft and smooth as good conditioners should do. I have tried so many kinds of Shampoo and Conditioners and it is very difficult to find one that really works so I am just continuing using my Sebastian Penetraitt. I have to switch it up because using the same Shampoo &amp; Conditioner too long it doesn&#x27;t work as well. I would love a recommendation for a great Conditioner. :)</li>
