<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We were needing a good, solid pair of tweezers and the Tweezerman had some great reviews so we went ahead with it. We weren&#x27;t really excited about how expensive they were, but we thought, if they are that great, it will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we haven&#x27;t been too happy with them at all because they are so sharp! Instead of being able to pull out a splinter, it will cut it in half while you are trying to remove it, making it exceedingly hard and extra painful to remove something that is already unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;If you pluck your eyebrows with tweezers (I know, old school), then you can forget using these little fellas. They don&#x27;t pull the hair out from the base, they just cut it where the hair meets the skin, creating much quicker than normal hair re-growth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really not sure what they are good for, to be honest. They are like miniature scissors.&lt;br /&gt;I would opt for another brand, though I&#x27;m not sure which one.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical due to the price but bought anyway.  The wife and I tend to fight over these and they&#x27;re known as the &amp;#34;good tweezers&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> used these alot already. they have a great tip and good grab.serious tweesin. and they fit into any go bag</li>
    <li> I bought this to pull cactus needles out of my body in case I should take a digger while riding my mountain bike. Fortunately, no need for that yet, but I did ride through a cactus patch and had to extract tons of small needles from my tire. These worked great for doing that small detailed grabbing. Really happy so far. Hopefully I&#x27;ll never need them to remove cactus needles from my person...</li>
    <li> Very convenient.  Comes in a carrying tube.  Good for trips.  Well made.  Still need to squeeze tight when pulling out a hair.</li>
    <li> These tweezers will tweeze anything that needs tweezing.    What more can you ask for.   I smile every time I use them, whether removing a splinter from my hand or mangrooming my eyebrows.      Excellent product that I fully expect to have for years and years.</li>
    <li> best tweezer ever. Size, performance, and case is very convenient. don&#x27;t let the price scare you, its worth it.</li>
    <li> These little tweezers work perfectly and are nicely finished. They  grasp the hair firmly so it pulls out every time without repeated tries. They are small but fit perfectly in hand; extra length would not make them function any better. Makes me want to try other Tweezerman products.</li>
    <li> I bought this tweezer two years ago and it works great. It&#x27;s the best tweezer out of all the other tweezers that I&#x27;ve bought and tried. The way you hold them and the way the tweezer grabs is just perfect.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying another just to have a spare even though it&#x27;s a little pricey for a tweezer but It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used for eyebrow plucking.  Also, I love the little clear plastic storage container they include with the purchase -- makes them easy to store and locate in my over-stuffed medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> The tweezerman tweezer is perfect.  The only issue I had with it was the packaging.  It was in a plastic tube that looked homemade.  However, the tweezerman did do it&#x27;s job and no complaints about the craftmanship for the first time use.  I will see how long the craftmanship will last.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my brother&#x27;s tweezerman tweezers. I dont know why though. They are definitely better than all the other tweezers I had like revlon or generic, but they could be better like my brother&#x27;s. He has the colored ones also slant but not the mini slant. Spend a few dollars more for the bigger ones.</li>
    <li> Durable tweezers that work!  At last!  I&#x27;ve had them for several months now and they are indispensable.  I got sick of wasting my money on cheap-o tweezers that are inevitably useless.  These are a great pair of tweezers, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are good quality tweezers! They are made well, and grab the hair the way they are supposed to! can&#x27;t come up with any cons, really..!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know much about tweezers so, this mini pair by Tweezerman seem to fit my needs well. Use them to pull hangnails, splinters or excess skin after cuts and scrapes. They work well for me. Arrived in their own plastic protective tube. May seem a bit overpriced but, they are well made plus, saved myself a trip to my local drugstore.</li>
    <li> i love the size of these tweezers and they are very easy to travel with. the tip is very precise and they are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Product as described . Precision is perfect for those fine hair hard to get usually . Good product for the price !</li>
    <li> These tweezers are well made with precise tweezing surfaces for easy grip of single fine hairs. They are a more or less standard design but high quality and reliable unlike some other models.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman makes the best tweezers because they are sharp and they mean to pull whatever you need removed. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it&#x27;s so sharp, it sometimes does not pluck the hairs but cut it. It&#x27;s quite frustrating at times when you hope to remove the little hairs, it ends up cutting the hair. All in all, Tweezerman does make the best tweezers. This one is small and portable, hardly takes any space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Perfect set of tweezers and excellent price.  They actually grab fine thin hairs easily the first time.  They are easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that it is not made in Germany. The quality is just average and i cannot pick and pull very short and fine hair with them.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman, way worth the price!</li>
    <li> nobody makes better tweezers!  Well worth the price for sure.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than these work as expected. They close tight and do not have a tendency to &amp;#34;flare&amp;#34; out when squeezed to hold onto something (a huge plus). I would buy these again should I need another pair.</li>
    <li> Tweezing is never fun but this tweezer makes the process efficient. It grabs even the finest strand and removes it in one try. I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased the Tweezeman Mini Slant Tweezer.</li>
    <li> Great, low priced tweezers.</li>
    <li> Wife says it hurt to pull thr hairs</li>
    <li> these pair of tweezers are great! they easily get stubborn hairs with ease! i love this thing so very much!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several tweezers before  these are the best ever  you can spend more  you cant get any better</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great!  I have a pair for my purse and one for my bathroom!  I given them away for gifts too!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, compact and functional. There are many tweezers on the market but few show the quality and edge of these. They are well worth their price and you wonl&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I have owned this tweezer in the pink color for about two years now. Imagine my surprise when I caught my husband sneaking into my makeup bag a few nights ago to borrow my pink tweezerman tweezers. The nerve! So this week I purchased him his own set in silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that they come in their own protective tube. They stay super sharp, even after a few years of regular use. They are small so if your hands are large or you have problems manipulating small things, you may want the standard size model.  That said, my husband seems to like them just fine. Amazon&#x27;s price is better than that at the beauty store. Prime shipping makes them a deal.</li>
    <li> Excellent tweezer, very flush contact point. handy protective tube to protect and keep them straight.</li>
    <li> Coming from bargain tweezers at walmart and target these tweezers are really a step up. Their holding power is great and they don&#x27;t flex or slip once they have a hold like lesser brands have in the past. Also, regarding the size I have seen some reviews that state they are too small. I disagree and it is worth noting that the tweezers also come with a protective tube case for storage which is a welcomed extra. I would highly recommend this product and stop wasting money on lesser items.</li>
    <li> High quality tweezer, blades well aligned and precision made.  Use in travel kit in place of original tweezers.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Best ever tweezers with lots of grab for very little grip. Bought several of these for gifts after trying to use my wife&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Quite simply, the greatest tweezer ever.  It is a precision item, capable of&lt;br /&gt;all forms of usage, the best... and not one of the silly pretenders on the&lt;br /&gt;tweezer front.</li>
    <li> A lot better than what I had. Did not live up to other reviews though. Does rip and miss hairs. Its not magical, but its good.</li>
    <li> I ordered these via Amazon prime to deal with a splinter that I had gotten and they worked.&lt;br /&gt;These simple stainless steel tweezers are the best that I&#x27;ve used and have a great name. TWEEZERMAN.</li>
    <li> My mother asked if I could pick up a new pair of tweezers for her - the pair she has had for over 40 years went missing. I had these delivered to her and she called to tell me they had arrived and that they were awesome. She said she had never seen a pair of tweezers so precise like these and was no longer mourning the loss of her old tweezers. She was used to the older style with scissor type loop/handles and wasn&#x27;t sure how she would do with these with her arthritis, but she said they do a great job and they&#x27;re easy for her to hold.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great quality, and do not feel cheap at all. They are very nice to have, especially when plucking the hairs in between the eyebrows!</li>
    <li> got these after losing many other tweezers i owned. little pricey for tweezers but got them since so many reviews said they were reliable, so i put them to a test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On buying them, i totally thought it would be bigger, but not. It&#x27;s a smaller tweezer compared from average ones. It came with a white tubes you put it when not in use. I have to say very smart (since i have dropped many on accident and caused the tip not ever grab). This tweezers grabs just as good as i got it and I&#x27;ve had it for many months now. If it is ever not grabbing properly, i just wipe the grabbing tips and just as new. the springiness is still strong and not dulled out. So far this is my longest lasting tweezer I&#x27;ve owned with great satisfaction.</li>
    <li> This words wonderfully, I never realized that plunking could be so easy, Hurts pulling hair from the nose. Not nice, makes me eyes water.</li>
    <li> Perfect little tweezers.  Not too small that you can&#x27;t use them, but more like the perfect size.  The are def high quality and can even pinch one single hair with ease.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy and find it necessary to tweeze myself every once in a while. I don&#x27;t particularly feel the desire to buy gold plated diamond tipped tweezers even if they are effective so I am really happy to have found these cheap and reliable tweezers that can grab my superfluous hairs and remove them painlessly and easily.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman tweezers are excellent products. I have a couple of different ones they make. All are top quality and work as expected for the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why we can&#x27;t just use a star rating and have to type out some sort of explanation?</li>
    <li> I have used tweezers for years for my eyebrows but these are by far the best I have used.  They are small but just right and they can pluck the smallest, finest hairs.  Excellent and worth a few extra dollars.</li>
    <li> This tweezer is the epitome of what a tweezer should be. It even comes with a little storage case. Can&#x27;t wait for my next splinter...</li>
    <li> These tweezers cost more than the ones at the drug store but they are so worth it. In an effort to save money, I have not been waxing my eyebrows as often. These tweezers may it easy to keep up with my eyebrows in between waxings. If I leave this tweezers out on the bathroom sink, they are known to disappear - My husband loves them and he normally does not comment on mundane things such as tweezers. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a classic Tweezerman sharpened-tip tweezer, but in a much smaller size, perfect for on the go. I love this! It&#x27;s about 2-3 inches long, and the sharpened tips grab onto hairs beautifully!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are small and very convenient to use. They are easy to use and efficient. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I find these very handy for tidying the eyebrows.  I might buy a couple more pairs, just to keep them handy around the house.  Also one for the first aide kit.  They feel well-balanced and as though they will last forever.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as previous tweezers from this brand.  The fine grip is not as accurate.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase - this is just what I was expecting - nothing less nothing more.  I would purchase this again if needed.</li>
    <li> Usually I feel safe buying Tweezerman brand. These feel like some generic knock off - they don&#x27;t work well and are super stiff to use. I had to go buy a new pair at the beauty supply!</li>
    <li> Ok I was skeptical, but now I believe that these are certainly the best tweezers I have ever used. I can&#x27;t believe that I could become so get excited about anything so mundane but they&#x27;re just really great tweezers.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is one of the few brands left that you can count on for quality, at least in my experience.  As a disclaimer I will say I&#x27;ve only purchased tweezers from them.  It lived up to expectations, a durable, functional tweezers.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected, but effective. The angled edge allows for versatility.</li>
    <li> These are my all time favorite tweezers. I will never buy anything else!</li>
    <li> These are very good tweezers.  If you have used dollar store tweezers your whole life you will be amazed by how great these are.</li>
    <li> I just needed a small pair of tweezers to use for the random stray eyebrow hair that grows once in a while, or the splinters I get from time to time. These come in a small plastic case and they work great.</li>
    <li> Did it really need to do anything else? Plus, it&#x27;s made in India!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable and serves its purpose. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are great, but they are a little small for my hands. If the length were just a little bit longer, they would be more comfortable to fit in my average-sized adult hands.</li>
    <li> I do not like the slant Tweezers, they do not grip little hairs properly.  Much prefer the straight tip and also the scissors type, which appear to be unobtainable at present.  Not a happy chappy!</li>
    <li> Buy these at the local store.  The one I received is not very good and sub par vs. the Target version.</li>
