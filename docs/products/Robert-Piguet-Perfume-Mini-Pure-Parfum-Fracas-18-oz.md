### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>alot of scent,at a very good price !</li>
      <li>The price is great and perfect for traveling and putting in your purse.</li>
      <li>Great size bottle for traveling or tucking into a purse.  </li>
      <li>smells good, zero staying power</li>
      <li>Love this scent!</li>
      <li>and I also love gardenias, so good match for me.  </li>
      <li>Everybody has to find their own &amp;#34;I just gotta have it because this is me&amp;#34; fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Is that even a word? :-)</li>
      <li>I would give this seller more stars if I were able.  </li>
      <li>The most fragrant and seductive perfume.  </li>
      <li>Just ok scent.  </li>
      <li>However, I would like the top to be a bit more secure.</li>
      <li>I never smelled &amp;#34;Fracas&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t know, but this teeny-tiny bottle sure doesn&#x27;t ring true to me.</li>
      <li>Sweet, not overpowering or sophisticated.</li>
      <li>This is my signature scent, and I always apply it lightly.  </li>
      <li>I mix a drop with aragon oil and stroke through my hair for a glossy and sweet scent.</li>
      <li>I love tuberose and gardenia scents, and Fracas goes very well on me.  </li>
      <li>Delivery wasn&#x27;t as quick as I&#x27;d hope for, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is absolutely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even know if it is the right perfume.</li>
      <li>Would be appropriate for a young lady&#x27;s first perfume.</li>
      <li>this perfume has a very nice scent, the problem is, it seems to wear off within 2 hours, there is no more scent</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.  </li>
      <li>and it had the same effect on men  way before he became a very important factor in my life.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I only wish that it was a spray top.</li>
      <li>I put it into a plastic vial to make sure it didn&#x27;t open accidentally.</li>
      <li>so was glad to find a tiny bottle of the real thing.</li>
      <li>Fracas has been a long time favorite scent (Tuberose &amp; Gardenia blend) of mine.</li>
      <li>I question if this is the real thing.</li>
      <li>and I appreciated getting it at this price.</li>
      <li>Fracas is a real &amp;#34;keeper.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My new favoritest perfume!</li>
      <li>This is my new GO TO seller.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look new.</li>
      <li>That sure has happened in the past.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep adding more of this scent to my collection in case it gets hard to find.  </li>
      <li>Glad I only bought a small amount.</li>
      <li>I did not want to open the bottle yet, as I still have a quarter left in my older bottle, but I just had to.  </li>
      <li>It is possible others near me can still smell it.</li>
      <li>The first thing that I noticed was it was darker in colour than the last TWO bottles I purchased from other sellers.  </li>
      <li>I know it is meant to be a small bottle, but it really doesn&#x27;t look new</li>

    <li> smells good, zero staying power</li>
    <li> alot of scent,at a very good price !</li>
    <li> I would give this seller more stars if I were able.  This is my signature scent, and I always apply it lightly.  As perfume has a shelf life, this is my preferred size. I received my item immediately.  The first thing that I noticed was it was darker in colour than the last TWO bottles I purchased from other sellers.  I did not want to open the bottle yet, as I still have a quarter left in my older bottle, but I just had to.  There is no doubt in my mind, that the prior bottles were diluted.  THIS is what FRACAS parfum should smell like. I have been wearing this scent for ~35 years so I think I should know. This is my new GO TO seller.  Thank you very much.  I actually thought that I was beginning to lose some of my sense of smell.</li>
    <li> The packaging was horrible. It was a ripped bag taped up. The bottle was in tissue paper, not in a box and I bought it for a gift. I don&#x27;t even know if it is the right perfume. It doesn&#x27;t look new. I know it is meant to be a small bottle, but it really doesn&#x27;t look new and I don&#x27;t know how I could ever give it as a gift!</li>
    <li> Would be appropriate for a young lady&#x27;s first perfume. Sweet, not overpowering or sophisticated. Would definitely buy for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel and I appreciated getting it at this price. However, I would like the top to be a bit more secure. I put it into a plastic vial to make sure it didn&#x27;t open accidentally.</li>
    <li> Just ok scent.  Everybody has to find their own &amp;#34;I just gotta have it because this is me&amp;#34; fragrance.  This was not mine.</li>
    <li> I love tuberose and gardenia scents, and Fracas goes very well on me.  I&#x27;ll keep adding more of this scent to my collection in case it gets hard to find.  That sure has happened in the past.  Fracas is a real &amp;#34;keeper.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have a sentimental attachment to this fragrance and I also love gardenias, so good match for me.  I wish it would last a little longer, but in my experience with a lot of fragrances, it may be that my nose simply gets used to it.  It is possible others near me can still smell it.</li>
    <li> Love this scent! I don&#x27;t often wear perfume so was glad to find a tiny bottle of the real thing.</li>
    <li> I question if this is the real thing. I never smelled &amp;#34;Fracas&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t know, but this teeny-tiny bottle sure doesn&#x27;t ring true to me.</li>
    <li> This product is in my &#x27;Fragrance Hall Of Fame&#x27;!  My husband loves it when I wear it....and it had the same effect on men  way before he became a very important factor in my life.&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely worth the money.</li>
    <li> this perfume has a very nice scent, the problem is, it seems to wear off within 2 hours, there is no more scent</li>

    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last. Glad I only bought a small amount.</li>
    <li> The most fragrant and seductive perfume.  There isn&#x27;t a primate on this earth that can resist this smell.</li>
