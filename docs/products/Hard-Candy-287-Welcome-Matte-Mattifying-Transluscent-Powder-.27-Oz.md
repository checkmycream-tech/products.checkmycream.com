      <li>Great product for the price.</li>
      <li>Its a good product..</li>
      <li>good powder, not as mattifying as Id like, but fair</li>
      <li>This is a good one.</li>
      <li>Again, it is good.</li>
      <li>Was very pleased.</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>Good if you are on a budget and need something cheap.  </li>
      <li>Use it around the sides of my eyes toward the top of my cheek bone and on my nose.</li>
      <li>Takes the shine away :)</li>
      <li>I love this powder.</li>
      <li>It works but there are better mattifying powders out there.  </li>
      <li>What more can we ask for,right?</li>
      <li>it just mostly keeps the oil level under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just posting from my husband&#x27;s profile! :)</li>
      <li>Perhaps in another week or 2, I should be able to say more.</li>
      <li>It is important to me that the things I use are cruelty free.</li>
      <li>It gives me that porcelain skin that is so important to pin up.  </li>
      <li>lightly tap some of this product on my forehead and chin and it helps quite a bit.  </li>
      <li>but I was looking for something to lightly smooth out my complexion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-forties and use Hard Candy because it is not tested on animals AND because it works great for my sensitive skin AND is good quality AND has great,cute products AND is pretty darn inexpensive AND is very creative and clever.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and they really rang true.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for with</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>On top of it, it only stays on your face for like 5 minutes and then wipes off.</li>
      <li>Good for very pale people like my daughter.</li>
      <li>I had read good reviews on Hard Candy so ordered this mattifying powder.</li>
      <li>I cant tell much difference with this product on at all.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, the whole day you will be shine free!!!</li>
      <li>my favorite powder ever the only color that actually matches my skin tone i live for this makeup</li>
      <li>Now, I put this stuff over everything and literally go all day with a completely matte face.</li>
      <li>Usually after just a few hours my face would start becoming very shiny, I&#x27;d have to dab at it all the time.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a make up person.  I don&#x27;t use foundation but I was looking for something to lightly smooth out my complexion. It is important to me that the things I use are cruelty free. I really like this product and I will continue to purchase it.  It is so hard to find make-up that is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Good for very pale people like my daughter. I read the reviews and they really rang true. My daughter is a ginger and her skin is very pale. We have had a hard time finding a powder that matches. This is a good one.</li>
    <li> I work as a dental hygienist and have lots of moisture in the air as I work which means I get oily in my t-zone about halfway through my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lightly tap some of this product on my forehead and chin and it helps quite a bit.  I don&#x27;t use enough to see if there is any color to it.. it just mostly keeps the oil level under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I AM a woman- just posting from my husband&#x27;s profile! :)</li>
    <li> Its a good product.. Im happy with it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin at all. I used it with my matte finishing spray and it came off all over my phone. Rather not use this in my makeup routine. It also makes me look pale when it&#x27;s suppose to be translucent. And I&#x27;m not even that tan...</li>
    <li> Does not cover up tattoo I give it zero stars if I could</li>
    <li> I had read good reviews on Hard Candy so ordered this mattifying powder. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Use it around the sides of my eyes toward the top of my cheek bone and on my nose. Was very pleased.</li>
    <li> good powder, not as mattifying as Id like, but fair</li>
    <li> LOVE! Almost impossible to find locally anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price.  Comparable to BareMinerals Mineral Veil.  I use a big fluffy brush to apply.</li>
    <li> Great makeup i will keep buying it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very sheer setting powder that gives slight coverage. I use it over my liquid and it isn&#x27;t cakey which is always a plus. Lasts for a long time as well. Used to buy at walmart but they stopped carrying it so found on amazon!</li>
    <li> my favorite powder ever the only color that actually matches my skin tone i live for this makeup</li>
    <li> Good if you are on a budget and need something cheap.  It works but there are better mattifying powders out there.  Again, it is good.</li>
    <li> I love this powder. A little goes a long way, the whole day you will be shine free!!!</li>
    <li> ...too soon to tell at this time.  Perhaps in another week or 2, I should be able to say more.</li>
    <li> Another purchase that sucks. The top of the makeup gets all hard and plastic feeling and makes it hard for the product to even come up. On top of it, it only stays on your face for like 5 minutes and then wipes off. This sucks big ones.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for with my pin up girl make up look .  It gives me that porcelain skin that is so important to pin up.  It decreases shine, does not become flaky at nose like other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-forties and use Hard Candy because it is not tested on animals AND because it works great for my sensitive skin AND is good quality AND has great,cute products AND is pretty darn inexpensive AND is very creative and clever. What more can we ask for,right?</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Takes the shine away :)</li>
    <li> I have used this several times. I cant tell much difference with this product on at all. I dont think I will use it anymore. It was affordable but if I cant tell Im using it, its worthless.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Usually after just a few hours my face would start becoming very shiny, I&#x27;d have to dab at it all the time. Now, I put this stuff over everything and literally go all day with a completely matte face. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot, either.</li>
