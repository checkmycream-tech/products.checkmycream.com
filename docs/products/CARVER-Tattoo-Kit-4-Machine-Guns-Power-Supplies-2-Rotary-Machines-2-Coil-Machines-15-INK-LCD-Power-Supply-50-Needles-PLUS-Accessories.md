### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>you guys have great stuff!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>The rotary gun is the best out of the 2 machines.</li>
      <li>The machines are awesome!</li>
      <li>, you are good to do!</li>
      <li>The upside is that you get one very good machine, one good machine and two rotary machines that seem to function as a 8 years and up machines.</li>
      <li>the machines are great ilove that it came on time foreal</li>
      <li>Great staring kit.</li>
      <li>Great tattoo set up.</li>
      <li>everything else is great though.</li>
      <li>Well to start off I will say this is a great value but</li>
      <li>And, the ink quality isn&#x27;t too good.</li>
      <li>This kit had all I need to get off to a knowledgable start and has good equipment</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, gave it to my wife and once she got her bother got ink</li>
      <li>We received our kit in the mail yesterday and were thrilled with everything we did get, but the kit advertised ink included and we didn&#x27;t get any at all.</li>
      <li>if you are getting this kit you will also want to get a better power supply and good ink.</li>
      <li>The ink is okay, the power supply was spotty at best, I had to return the first power supply just after 2 uses</li>
      <li>The inks were more in line with the consistency of tar, and the non-rotary machines were more style over substance.</li>
      <li>As a start up kit, I guess it&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>I love in Germany and it got here faster</li>
      <li>This was an ok starter kit.  </li>
      <li>The guns are clearly not the best.  </li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m getting better and better with my new gear</li>
      <li>all colors were good not the same color machines as in picture</li>
      <li>the instructional DVD and book are very helpful, basic but good.</li>
      <li>If you want to do it professionally you would have to invest more.</li>
      <li>The motor burnt up right when plugging it in.  </li>
      <li>Granted, you might need more supplies later on, but to do atleast 10 tattoos</li>
      <li>This kit is a good buy for the money especially if you are just starting out.</li>
      <li>Very informative tutorials included.</li>
      <li>so Fast Fast Fast!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Thanks again Pirate Face...</li>
      <li>the second seems to be fine so far.</li>
      <li>over all the kit is a decent kit for starters, but the ink needs to be addressed.  </li>
      <li>this product came with ink that was contaminated and caused blistering on a client as well as myself, discarded all the ink and purchased new.  </li>
      <li>The kit came with everything as described, though I had to go online to figure out how exactly to put the machine together, being totally novice.</li>
      <li>Other than that I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase and would highly suggest it for a curious, or beginning artist.</li>
      <li>Another gun had a piece break after a few uses but it was a cheap fix.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s barely been only a month.</li>
      <li>I receive this package perfectly fine, however One of the guns was broken from the start, my husband didn&#x27;t informed me til now, when the another gun just stop working along with the power supply.</li>

<li> power supply is inconsistant, along with one of the rotary guns already showing signs of wear, only used approximately 20 hours.  </li>
<li> I bought to practice on fake skin and on myself , it gave me a lot of confidence for the next step.</li>

<li> This is an awful tattoo kit.</li>

    <li> As a start up kit, I guess it&#x27;s OK. The upside is that you get one very good machine, one good machine and two rotary machines that seem to function as a 8 years and up machines. But I do understand that you get what pay for, none the less, I say I would recommend it, its a start and the instructional DVD and book are very helpful, basic but good.</li>
    <li> The kit came with everything as described, though I had to go online to figure out how exactly to put the machine together, being totally novice. I was using the kit the night I received it and the only complaint I have is that the power supply is inconsistent, but gets the job done. And, the ink quality isn&#x27;t too good. Other than that I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase and would highly suggest it for a curious, or beginning artist.</li>
    <li> The machines are awesome! It works well, but the grips are bit bigger hopefully they make a pen size. The shipping was so Fast Fast Fast!!!&lt;br /&gt;But some items are missing like the tattoo skin and transfer stencil paper. 😟😟😟😟</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my tattooist daughter. When I spoke w/ her today, she says the guns seem well made and the dyes are as advertised.</li>
    <li> there were a few missing things that one would need for tatooing such as ink. it was promised but not in the box when i opened it. i think thats my only problem with it.</li>
    <li> Great staring kit. I bought to practice on fake skin and on myself , it gave me a lot of confidence for the next step. If you want to do it professionally you would have to invest more.</li>
    <li> The spinner machine broke at the barrel tensioner all colors were good not the same color machines as in picture</li>
    <li> I bought this kit because I want to due a cover up tattoo on myself. I like the guns and the way the kit is set up. I&#x27;m still in the practicing and research stage. I&#x27;m considering on buying another set.</li>
    <li> This is an awful tattoo kit. The power supply died two days after I bought it. The inks were more in line with the consistency of tar, and the non-rotary machines were more style over substance.</li>
    <li> We received our kit in the mail yesterday and were thrilled with everything we did get, but the kit advertised ink included and we didn&#x27;t get any at all. It is a non returnable item.</li>
    <li> Very informative tutorials included. This kit had all I need to get off to a knowledgable start and has good equipment</li>
    <li> Well to start off I will say this is a great value but the power supply just crapped out on me everything else is great though. if you are getting this kit you will also want to get a better power supply and good ink.</li>
    <li> the machines are great ilove that it came on time foreal and i&#x27;m getting better and better with my new gear</li>
    <li> I just started Tattooing. For the amount that you will pay for a costly kit, this is all you will need to start tattooing. Granted, you might need more supplies later on, but to do atleast 10 tattoos, you are good to do! Great product! Also fast shipping. I love in Germany and it got here faster then what was stated!</li>
    <li> Great tattoo set up. Can&#x27;t agree with the earlier testimonials. Everything is running perfectly as long as you maintain them!!!! I purchased this setup about recently and I think the kit in its entirety is on point!!  I&#x27;ve done about 20 tattoos with the rotary and coil... would definitely grade the rotary (for shading) way above average then the other setups I&#x27;ve used. Your gonna appreciate the how it runs when your shading in a lower pitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest peeve is the ink. They do the job but if your as picky as I am... I&#x27;d go for the upgrades (Kuro Sumi or Intenze). Thanks again Pirate Face... you guys have great stuff!</li>
    <li> I receive this package perfectly fine, however One of the guns was broken from the start, my husband didn&#x27;t informed me til now, when the another gun just stop working along with the power supply. It&#x27;s barely been only a month. I am not satisfied to know that these guns are not lasting long enough to even complete an artwork. Is there anything that you can do to help me with this issue, please?</li>
    <li> This was an ok starter kit.  Just be careful.  The guns are clearly not the best.  Takes some getting used to.  One gun didn&#x27;t even get used once. The motor burnt up right when plugging it in.  Another gun had a piece break after a few uses but it was a cheap fix.  Over all it&#x27;s a mediocre quality kit.  Only for beginners.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, gave it to my wife and once she got her bother got ink and so did she. She loves it</li>
    <li> this product came with ink that was contaminated and caused blistering on a client as well as myself, discarded all the ink and purchased new.  power supply is inconsistant, along with one of the rotary guns already showing signs of wear, only used approximately 20 hours.  over all the kit is a decent kit for starters, but the ink needs to be addressed.  Would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> This kit is a good buy for the money especially if you are just starting out. The ink is okay, the power supply was spotty at best, I had to return the first power supply just after 2 uses the second seems to be fine so far. The rotary gun is the best out of the 2 machines. For the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong though. Also fo rthose of you that may not know and may be in the area. The store is actually located in Whittier CA. and if you have any problems with any of the items in the kit as I did (and are in the area) they had no problem swapping out the power supply that I had a problem with.</li>
