      <li>The color is a nice neutral color and wears well with just about anything.</li>
      <li>I just started doing the shellac nails at home and this color is a nice, neutral shade.  </li>
      <li>I would suggest using a nice cuticle oil (or any oil) on your cuticles after painting and curing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails now at home for almost 2 years</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice nude/pink.</li>

      <li>Thank you CND.  :)</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to keep nail polish on longer than a day before it was ruined.</li>
      <li>Shellac is also wonderful because you can paint over it with regular nail polish and then remove the polish with non-acetone remover without damaging the Shellac!</li>
      <li>This is my FAVORITE shellac color.</li>
      <li>Two coats looks more of an opaque off-white.</li>
      <li>I gave this a four instead of five because it isn&#x27;t my favorite color.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this in the mail and was excited to try it.  However, when I put it on, it dried unevenly and clumped up so that it creates a striping effect and it looks terrible! I read online somewhere that this happens when the mail polish is old.  So disappointing! If I spend 15 dollars on some fancy nail polish, I want it to be fresh enough so that it actually works. I&#x27;m a little angry that this happened and am seeking a refund.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE shellac color. It is comparable to a light, opaque, nude - one that is not TOO light, but isn&#x27;t dark or muddy looking. I had this color done at my salon first before I bought it myself. It is apparently the most requested color from clients and I can see why. It is NOT sheer - it is opaque so it looks very clean and chic. NOTE: I have experimented many times with doing my own shellac nails with the UV lamp. I highly recommend baking them 3x after the color coats for them to really set. When I did that, the color stayed on VERY long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months.  At first I loved it because it lasted about three weeks and made my nails feel strong.  The acetone used to remove the polish is very drying, though, and now my nails are splitting and breaking.  I&#x27;ve been using Romantique because I like the light color, but now when I use it, after about four days it turns dark at the tips of my nails.  It looks like I&#x27;ve rubbed my nails over newsprint, but even worse, the dark stain is seeping through the polish and turning my nails dark brown.  I can&#x27;t buff out the stain without taking off layers of my nail.     Although I liked this product at first, I finally quit using it and switched to gel nail polish.  I hope the gel works because I sure like having my polish last two or three weeks.</li>
    <li> Great products and great color, very natural.I love shellac. I used to pay 35.00 every two weeks now I do it at home for much less.</li>
    <li> This color is neutral and soo beautful....I love the Shellac polish. This system does not make my nails hurt like the gelish. You will love the natural hue to this with the white polish. Just remember to cure 2 min for each polish. And use 90 percent alcohol when finished to remove the sticky finish and you will have dry beautiful, shiny nails.</li>
    <li> I would describe this as a perfect neutral pink that is semi-sheer and not sparkly or iridescent... Just a nice sheer pink. I use one coat, which allows my natural nail line to show through and the self-leveling formula really does self level! Awesome. And by the way, I have worn this color and find that the color stays true for the full two weeks.</li>
    <li> Super classy. It&#x27;s a nice nude/pink. Very professional.</li>
    <li> The seller was great, the product itself fell short. The paint is a &#x27;soft&#x27; paint and doesn&#x27;t stick well. Not only that but the nail tips turn yellowish after a day or two. Annoying... The color is pretty though, if you plan on only wearing it for a week. Hopefully I can try other brands with a similar color..OPI makes a color called bubbles that&#x27;s really nice!</li>
    <li> Did not work properly, did not set up</li>
    <li> Pretty, but needs many coats.</li>
    <li> I *LOVE* doing my own shellac nails! My natural nails are very thin and full of ridges. The CND shellac makes them so pretty, smooth and shiney. It looks beautifully natural and lasts about 2 weeks. Thank you CND.  :)</li>
    <li> I love CND Shellac and this Romantique is my favorite!  I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails now at home for almost 2 years and I have found that CND Shellac works the best for me in terms of quality of the product, wear time, and ease in removal.  This color is a nice basic neutral that is great for everyday.  Lately I have been doing only ONE coat of the Romantique with ONE coat of the CND Shellac color Negligee which is my new favorite.  It makes the color a bit more sheer with a hint of an opaque shimmer to it.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Shellac is the best gel polish that exist right now, I do my nails every wk, I prefer romantique pink for a french  manicure, I would recommend this product to everyone who prefers gel polish vs acrylic nails, i love gel polish cause I&#x27;m a nurse and can not were acrylics.</li>
    <li> It helps if you apply a light coat of bonder on the nail bed.  Then apply the Shellac base coat and cure.  Then the colour coat and cure. The the top coat and cure...turns out perfect every time!  After finishing the top coat, you&#x27;ll notice a slightly tacky finish on your nails.  Take a lint free pad and soak it with 91% alcohol and rub it off.  Voila!  Perfection!</li>
    <li> After reviewing what little I can find on this new UV nail technology, I decided to give it a try. I bought the CND Shellac UV base coat, the Romantique Shellac UV color coat and the Shellac UV top coat. Also, I didn&#x27;t find out until reading the directions for the UV top coat that you need pure acetone nail polish remover. Gee thanks! A visit to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply coming up! Unfortunately you cannot test the UV nail polish without a UV lamp. I bought the Mastex Thermal Spa for $72.99. This was a big investment for what would turn out to be a failed nail polish system.    I followed the directions for the base coat, color coat and top coat. By the time I was done, I had a messy, smeary, sticky gob on each nail. This was after at least a dozen attempts within a two-week period.     The good news is the claim stating the UV gel nails are easily removed is a true statement. After each messy attempt, I just peeled it off each nail! Had the UV gel nails actually turned out nicely, what a disappointment that would be to find it doesn&#x27;t stick to your nails.</li>
    <li> This is the classic pale whitish pink color that you see on nails a lot. It looks very clean &amp; stylish. I bought to do my nails at home. Like all polishes, you have to get it on evenly or you&#x27;ll have streaks. It is a little harder to do with shellac but with practice (maybe 2 or 3 manicures) you&#x27;ll get it down.</li>
    <li> This product was used in a salon and looked good but when I tried to apply it at home, it caked up, would not dry and was very sticky  Have to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Shellac colors are amazing!  You go more than 2 weeks without any chips in your manicure!  I bought this color along with the \\&quot;Negligee\\&quot; color, and they go fantastic together.  Such a pretty and elegant combination.</li>
    <li> Takes a couple coats to get full coverage so have to be careful to keep it from spreading to the cuticle edge. Was my first attempt at shellac though so will probably have more success next time. All in all very happy with the color and appearance using all CND products.</li>
    <li> I like this color and posted pictures of it on my fingernails. It&#x27;s a subtle pink that is natural but not too natural looking. In other words, it contrasts enough with my skin color to be able to tell I do have polish on. I didn&#x27;t want a color that blends in too well with my skin tone to be invisible, so I&#x27;m happy with this color. The only bad thing is that it&#x27;s a bit streaky. Next time I&#x27;ll focus on very thin, even coats and if it&#x27;s still streaky I&#x27;ll do 3 coats of color.    Please do research and watch some youtube videos on applying CND Shellac before purchasing. A UV lamp is needed and there are several other mandatory steps to do a successful Shellac application.     I&#x27;m not the most tidy nail painter and read that if any got on your cuticles it would all peel off. Yes, there&#x27;s some on my cuticles but I&#x27;m on day 5 with this color and no chips yet. Shellac is incredibly shiny even when there&#x27;s lotion or soap scum on top of it.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional, and I bought the base coat, 3 different polishes, the top coat, and UV lamp, and my nails are fabulous. I will probably never go back to regular polish again. This stuff may be a lot more expensive, but with as little as I use and how long it stays looking really fresh (over 2 weeks), it&#x27;s totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is a great neutral color. Its perfect with everything color and cloth type. Higly recomended this product. Shellac is amazing!</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying gel nail polishes. I bought this one along with CND Studio White (a soft and creamy color) for my french manicure. It worked great, the product is awesome, and the color worked perfectly for a french manicure. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it just by itself, because I think it&#x27;s very soft, but it looks perfect.  The product is amazing, it works perfectly and it lasts for two weeks or even more without chipping! :) For me, two weeks is already a great deal, so I&#x27;m sticking with gel nail polish from now on! (Try also the Gelish nail polishes, they work great if you mix and match too!)</li>
    <li> Product is great, stays on for 2 weeks as promised, beautiful natural color.  Recieved the shipment quickly (w/i 3 days).</li>
    <li> This Shellac polish is fabulous. Lasts a full 14 days without chipping and it stays so shiny. I love it. The shipping was very quick for international. I would definatley buy a similar product from the same seller.</li>
    <li> I went to have my nails done two times with the shellac and loved it. I am a girl who always paints my nails but before this product I was painting my nails every 3-4 days. With wildfire I was able to go 2 1/2 weeks the the only reason I had to go back was from grow out. I got french the next time and went 3 weeks! I invested in a lamp and 3 colors. I just used romantique last night beatiful natural color, easy to do yourself!</li>
    <li> Great polish color . . . very soft natural pink that goes with anything.  Love the Shellac brand!  Best manicure products ever!</li>
    <li> I love Shellac and this is a must have color. The price is good, the shipping is great and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love the Shellac polish.  Wears very well.  This color is perfect for the french manicure.  I only have to do my nails about every 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a great color for a french manicure or anyone who wants natural looking nails. Hard to apply with out it looking streaky. I usually apply a 3rd color coat which makes the color totally opaque and eliminates the streaking issue.</li>
    <li> This is the shade for the classic manicure. Yes, it is pink but timeless and neutral enough for everyday wear (work, wedding, vacation, anywhere!). Two coats turn out to be pretty opaque for me. I&#x27;d recommend one coat for French unless you have a very bright white shade as the tip.</li>
    <li> Love this low-key, goes with everything, feminine gel color.  Took it to my manicurist with me - she went online and bought 2 bottles that very day!</li>
    <li> Great, fast service! Product exactly as described. Would recommend CND Cosmetics shellac and this seller. Highly recommend CND cosmetics for the salon look at home.</li>
    <li> I only needed one coat and it resembles two coats of my long-time favorite, Bubble Bath.  Two coats and it is a more modern white/pink.  Great as your &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; natural manicure look.</li>
    <li> The shellac romatique came very fast. Romantique was the exact color. Was the real deal not the fake stuff. Will order again from seller. Can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors.</li>
    <li> This color is exactly what I was hoping it would be! I&#x27;m so nervous with the Shellac colors because they never look the same on your nail as the color of the bottle, but this one was a really good color. It is very similar to the color of the bottle BUT it&#x27;s not nearly as opaque. I did two coats and you can still sort of see my natural nail underneath, but you can definitely tell I&#x27;m wearing polish. I just got the whole system to do my shellac nails and so far it&#x27;s working perfectly!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order this somthing has gone wrong</li>
    <li> Perfect color! Exactly what I wanted! This is the best shellac on the market! It last forever but is very easy to take off. Only a few mins of soaking in acetone, comes right off &amp; doesn&#x27;t damage my nail at all. Was delivered super fast too!</li>
    <li> I love this polish and it stays on without chipping for weeks and weeks. I also love the netural color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing Shellac for a couple of months now and I absolutely love it.  I&#x27;m very busy at work and home and this is the best solution to have beautiful  nails. They last more than 2 weeks but its better if you do it every two weeks.</li>
    <li> My first experience with Romantique was at the spa when the nail tech applied it, but it was too sheer, even with 3 thin coats. I bought it and attempted to apply it myself. Sadly this color just does not work on me. I wish it did because it seems like the perfect shade for me. It is a milky pale pink but is super sheer. I could still see the white part of my nail underneath and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> This store was easy to order from and the product was delivered quickly (before expected) with no troubles at all.  I would definitely order from them again.  I do believe this shipping is way too much as it would not cost that much for me to ship two little bottles totaling 1/2 ounce of liquid.  However, their price was the best on line even with the rip off for shipping.</li>
    <li> While these are excellent products, you must resist the urge to peel off the polish as it does so much damage to your natural nail.  Please have it removed properly to save your nails!!</li>
    <li> The seller was great, no problems in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t happy with the choice I made in the color. The color itself was pretty but it is one of those colors that if you are not VERY careful in getting just the right amount on the brush it is streaky and uneven looking. I have had other nailpolishes do that. I think with practice in getting the least bit possible on the brush and maybe only doing one color coat it would work, OR us this as a second coat over a diffent color might be good. Less is more!</li>
    <li> I Love this color and the the product lasts about 2.5 weeks with no chipping. The color is very neutral</li>
    <li> The product is fine...just NOT what I expected or wanted.  I THOUGHT it would be a sheer color that could be used alone or as a layer over another color.  It&#x27;s opaque, about the color indicated BY the bottle color....a very light pinkish-violet color.  I&#x27;m disappointed, but will use it under &amp;#34;Negligee&amp;#34; ... the sheer, translucent (blue-pink holographic) color I have subsequently purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this product.....would recommend most CND shellac polishes anytime, even though they are more expensive.....they&#x27;re worth it.  Product arrived on time as well</li>
    <li> Great colour, great coverage, works much better than the generic brands out there.  There is only one Shellac brand.  Buy CND or expect poor results!</li>
    <li> I love the CND gel polishes&lt;br /&gt;This is a great color&lt;br /&gt;Application is smooth and lasts at least 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was on schedule</li>
    <li> This is a super light pink, almost cream color. Very pretty on my caramel chocolate skin tone. I love this color because it&#x27;s almost like having clean white nails, but since it has a touch of color and it&#x27;s super shiny, it literally looks like you&#x27;ve had a fresh manicure every day. Lasts at least 2 weeks when applied properly.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite color by CND Shellac. I love shellac it last so long and looks great the entire time.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this color on two different occasions and it still didn&#x27;t meet up to standards.  If you want a semi clear polish this is your go to.  I wanted a solid color.  The first time I tried it with three coats.  Took it off immediately.  Then I practiced my &amp;#34;gel skills&amp;#34; with different colors and tried it again.  This time I made sure to not over coat each layer to try to keep it even.  I ended up putting four layers on and it still didn&#x27;t look great.  I won&#x27;t be wasting my time and energy trying it a third time.</li>
    <li> very nice color for french manicure, its different from the others i have, this one is a little more opaque like i was expecting</li>
    <li> This is a very light pink, I use it for the french manicure and alone for an almost bare look.</li>
    <li> This polish works great. Beautiful clean color. Wearing it for the holidays because it goes with everything. :-) Not sparkly but a shiny soft light light pink. I put on 2 layers to create an opaque look.</li>
    <li> The color is a nice neutral color and wears well with just about anything. It is long lasting and easily removed</li>
    <li> I tried light pink in another gel polish brand, but found this to have a much more natural, light pink tint to it.</li>
    <li> The product is fine, but I&#x27;m not wild about the color.</li>
    <li> I bought an entire set to do shellac nails from home..  This color is very soft and natural looking.  I wore it on my wedding day and it looks great.  Definitely needs to coats of paint.</li>
    <li> I love wearing shellac nail polish.  It dries rock hard in seconds &amp; lasts for weeks w/ little to no chips!  This color is a very nice, creaming light pink - very classy  &amp; clean looking, could easily be worn into the office! Romantique - I have finally found you - the perfect color!</li>
    <li> The shellac product is good. I gave a 4 star rating because of the color.  I have been trying to find a good pink color.  I&#x27;ve tried grapefruit which was too clear and hard to get a consistent color.  This romantique while it is a solid color it must be applied thin or it looks horrible. It looks more white to me then pink.  Not what I expected and I feel like it is too bold.  I wanted a pink color that is solid and matches my skin tone. Someone  said it was a flesh tone.  Maybe in the winter when you don&#x27;t have a tan.</li>
    <li> I love  these nail polishes.  The manicure lasts for at least a couple of weeks.  I know the price is high but it is a good product.  Now a days it is possible to buy these polishes from the drugstore also.  They need cured with an infrared light or they wont harden so read up on what you need before you buy.</li>
    <li> This polish is very natural and looks great with 3 coats.  It also looks great on top of the french manicure for a more natural finish.  Great purchase.  You can go at least three weeks with this color choice.</li>
    <li> The company did send this out right away and out of the four companies I ordered from on the same day, this arrived first, well boxed and with a coupon to their website. This made me very happy and I would order from them again for sure!   I gave this a four instead of five because it isn&#x27;t my favorite color.  I thought it would look more natural than it did.  I ordered this color, UV lamp, top and base coat and I hope it lasts the two weeks everyone says it will.  I am in my first week so I hope it lasts, so far so good!  I enjoy doing my own nails. It is expensive to get started but it will pay for itself after a few months.  The shellac does not go on exactly like a regular polish and while I am really good at painting my own nails this will take a couple of times for me to get used to it.  First time I did it and they look really good.  My only advice would be to be sure to keep the polish away from your cuticles and clean them off well before you put them under the lamp.</li>
    <li> UV Lamp is needed to use this product.  This information should be provided upfront, waste of money for me as I do not have UV lamp and don&#x27;t intend to buy one.</li>
    <li> This color is pretty on it&#x27;s own or when mixed with other colors of the same brand. A really nice color.</li>
    <li> This is a very flattering color, and it&#x27;s one of the easiest to apply.  No bubbling, and it&#x27;s great to go on fast when you don&#x27;t have time to be careful applying a darker shade.</li>
    <li> I just invested in doing shellac on my nails and this is the first color I have tried. I usually do not like milky pink colors because I find it hard to get them perfectly even, and any kind of streak annoys me. I did have to use 3 coats to avoid streaking, but I&#x27;m not sure if that is because I am unfamiliar with this product, or if that&#x27;s what it will always require. Either way, I am very please with the turnout. Other people say that they use this for the french manicure, I don&#x27;t think that would work for me because with 3 coats, you can&#x27;t even see your nail, or white paint underneath.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the CND equivalent to my favorite color, OPI Bubblebath.  This color is not transparent like Negligee. It&#x27;s a very delicate opaque milky pink (after two coats).  I love this color on my hands because it goes with everything and I never feel like my nail polish clashes with my clothing. I&#x27;ve tried a few other shellac colors and was a little disappointed, not because of quality, but because they were too sheer and basically looked like my nails had a clear coat on with a tint of pink, or a tint of pearl.  If you&#x27;re looking for a more opaque milky pink color similar to OPI bubblebath, this is so far your best bet.  : )</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color of nail enamel.  It reminds me of home in Brooklyn, NY.  It&#x27;s unusual, sophisticated.  I will always use it as long as its available.</li>
    <li> Use with UV light - not LED</li>
    <li> I received my product in fear that it wouldnt be the color that I ordered but I am very happy with the nail polish. And received it in the time that was promised.</li>
    <li> I found that regular nail polish worked better than this stuff. It puddled and looked very weird.</li>
    <li> I had my manicurist apply this Shellac on my nails today, as I have used it before and loved it! However, the contents of THIS&lt;br /&gt;bottle would not dry! Why??? Who knows. I&#x27;ll never use CND Shellac again!!</li>
    <li> Perfect natural color!  Goes on slightly translucent but two coats gives a nice French mani pale rose! Love the CND line!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Wears great and lasts the two weeks that it promises.  I have tried other gel polishes and this product definitely outshines them.  The color is great for the French manicure.</li>
    <li> I went back and forth on deciding to buy the products to do my own nails at home and I am glad I finally decided on CND. The base and top coats work SO well, are extremely shiny, and for me personally last about a week and a half. Having said that, I have very brittle peeling nails so I would imagine it would last longer if my nails were healthier. This is what I do: prep nails (I don&#x27;t use the special nail prep, I just wash them, press back my cuticles, shape nails, etc.), paint base coat, cure for two minutes, I then do two layers of a CND polish and I cure each layer 2 minutes, then I put the top coat on and I cure for 3 minutes. I then wipe nails with a regular ol alcohol from walmart and I use a washcloth with the alcohol. Done within maybe 20 minutes? Its great. I would suggest using a nice cuticle oil (or any oil) on your cuticles after painting and curing.</li>
    <li> Best gel nail polish on the market! Love this color for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> the color is neither white nor pink, not using it. Got clear pink instead, as it gives a healthy nail color look.</li>
    <li> After my first attempt at DIY shellac-- I am super pleased with this color. I  layered &amp;#34;Negligee&amp;#34; over it in an attempt to keep it a bit more sheer-- and honestly, I prefer just the romantique and will likely skip the other color in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that it would make a nice base for an American French Manicure. All in all very pleased-- and I agree with the other reviewer who said shipping was fast and great. This arrived before the top/base coat that I got from another seller. I&#x27;ll go to this seller first in the future.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and lasts for up to 3 weeks. The shade goes with everything.  I would recommend this Shellac to everyone.</li>
    <li> i love shellac polish. but this stuff did not cure. even after 5 or 6 attempts with the light box. i even tried drying them like normal with a fan and it never dried even after an hour.</li>
    <li> Great Color and a great way to get a professional manicure at home!  Manicure lasts about 2-3 weeks!  Great Purchase!</li>
    <li> This is the best color this company makes!!!  Kuddos</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  It did not dry once applied and I would not suggest.  I was not able to return it either.</li>
    <li> I wanted the color you always see on hand models. Something opaque and natural. This is a great color for that. Also good for muting a very bright color.</li>
    <li> Love this color! CND is a great product.  It is a perfect color as you are growing out your nails.</li>
    <li> i recently purchased all the supplies to do shellac at home, and am loving it. i maybe need a little practice being neater, but that&#x27;s all me. i&#x27;ve also found that you can use a regular polish over the top if you&#x27;d like to switch things up before the shellac begins to break down. being done over the top of the shellac, regular polish tends to last longer as well, and you can konad too! i did a special-design french tip over romantique tonight, and am pleased with the results (my first stamped tips!). bonus - you can &#x27;erase&#x27; with non-acetone polish if you screw up really bad!</li>
    <li> Shellac is a wonderful product and a must-try for nail fanatics. It genuinely stays chip-free for 14 days and is wayyyy shinier than any nail polish you can purchase in the store or from a salon.  Shellac is also wonderful because you can paint over it with regular nail polish and then remove the polish with non-acetone remover without damaging the Shellac! I do my own Shellac manicures at my home. The supplies can be a little pricey (light, base/top coat, color, etc) and it takes a time or two to perfect the technique, but at $20+ per Shellac manicure at a salon, it quickly pays itself off. I would truly recommend Shellac to any woman!!</li>
    <li> I just started doing the shellac nails at home and this color is a nice, neutral shade.  You can get by with only one coat and they still look great.  Goes on nicely; not thick or clumpy.  Would definitely buy another color.</li>
    <li> I use this shade at my manicurist&#x27;s and it makes my nails look gorgeous and natural.  I&#x27;m not quite sure why some reviewers have reported problems with drying.  I never have a problem and light colors dry much faster under UV than dark colors  (I&#x27;ve had both and dark colors take almost twice as long to dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a perfect color if you want natural looking nails with just a hint of pink.  Many people think I have had a french manicure, but it is just Romantique and my nail tips showing through.</li>
    <li> This product is old should have a shelf life I want to send it back.  Have polished my nails three times!!! and each time they have come out funky.... Not dryin and streakin even when I put on a thin coat. Amazon need to check the product before let something like this be sold ... I don&#x27;t have money to give away</li>
    <li> not my favorite color, looks milky. but everybody has different tastes in colors. I have tried it on other colors and so far I have not found where it looks good.</li>
    <li> Lovely color if you can apply 3 layers. Compared to other colors, it was hard to apply and have color spread evenly.</li>
    <li> I Love this color. It looks really natural. Would be perfect for French manicure. It&#x27;s just barely a pale pink.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to keep nail polish on longer than a day before it was ruined. This stuff wears through anything and stays shiny the whole time! The color is a nice natural sheer with a hint of whitish-pink, if you use one coat.Two coats looks more of an opaque off-white.</li>
    <li> the color is beautiful, but wish it were opaque.  needed 3 coats and still looks inconsistent.  probably great for french style, but not to stand alone.</li>
    <li> This color is great if you like an opaque, but natural look. I suggest applying three thin coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you shake the bottle well (30 seconds) before applying to avoid shrinking and pitting.</li>
    <li> shellac isn&#x27;t really my thing.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a color that was nice and neutral and this was it! I was worried that it would be too pinkish like some reviewers were saying but its very natural and looked great with my fair (slightly pink) skin color.</li>
    <li> You have to paint 1 coat on so it does not peel.  One color doesn&#x27;t give you a good color.  Bummer</li>
    <li> Do your research on what this does to your nails. Makes them weaker and brittle and they are not healthy after you try  to remove&lt;br /&gt;the polish, which was very difficult in it&#x27;s self.  This polish has to be filed off, no  nail remover works on it....seriously.</li>
    <li> This is by far my absolute favorite Shellac color. I wear this color during the spring and summer, almost exclusively. It can be quite bright with two coats so I only wear one coat and it enhances my natural nails beautifully.</li>
    <li> The color is super cute but the ship is too expensive. I bougth this bottle for 15 dols in my beauty supply but I want to see with amazon  and I paid 23 with tax and ship. Too much. I use this to work. Its not fair. I dont want to open the box. I want to return it back</li>
    <li> I was anxious to try this product, and I got a 36W UV Gel Lamp Curer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried twice, and the product peeled off after 5 to 7 days. (That was using a top coat as well). Not sure what the problem is, because I followed other reviews and allowed it to cure under the lamp for atleast 6 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Loved the color, but didn&#x27;t like how it stayed on. Also, it&#x27;s not clear when you should use 91% alcohol to get tacky residue off nails. Is it after the color, or after the top coat? Or both??&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> I received my product from the seller very fast, but I am so disappointed with the product.  I&#x27;ve been doing my gel nails at home for awhile, although using a different line. I really like this color and used to request it at the salon, but never had issues like I am now.  The color is very streaky, doesn&#x27;t set well with the light, and the color is not pigmented well.  I&#x27;ve given it two tries now and used longer set times with my LED light, and more coats.  Just not a good product.</li>
    <li> Overall, satisfied with this product. Nice neutral color, pairs well with any of my gel systems, don&#x27;t have to use a shellac base and top coat.</li>
    <li> Best Neutral color ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try topping with one coast neglige. Everyone asks what color I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> This is basically clear.  Did not create the desired look i was going for which was a shear pink. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love doing my own shellac with CND..... easy to do yourself at home for fraction of cost in salon.Out last any others!</li>
    <li> I start with a coat of Studio White then I apply two coats of Romantique.  It is the prettiest shade of nail polish I have ever worn in my entire life.  By having the base of white it makes it not as sheer and turns out a true milky pink.  My absolute favorite!!!! I wish I could attach a picture to this review so you can see how pretty  it is!  I have tried Romatique alone, and although very pretty it was a bit sheer for me.</li>
    <li> This is an elegant classic color. Works amazing like all the other shellac colors!</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  When I got it I was excited thinking this would strengthen and look great on my nails.  Shellac is shellac and you can get a better cheap grade at your local paint store.  Who are they fooling with this crap.  When I painted it on it did not spread evenly and after 3 coats it still looks like a 6 year old painted my nails.  It would not dry with one coat so I thought try 2...stupid idea; after 3 hours typing it was still sticky and wet...I put a clear coat of Hard as Nails on it and it finally dried and didn&#x27;t move.  Bottle says for &amp;#34;professional use only&amp;#34;  if you are professional you probably already know to steer clear of this stuff as it&#x27;s not worth the time or money.  You&#x27;d loose customers.  I&#x27;ve done my nails for years and this was a WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> Very natural looking color. I would suggest 2 -3 coats for a little more coverage. Very pretty with a white tip for French manicure look. Dries instantly with the UV Light and lasts 1.5 to 2 weeks (depending on nail growth and how picky you are with having nails pristine). Great buy and worth the value for extended wear polish! Off in minutes with soaking in pure professional grade acetone. *this is the 2nd step in a 3 part process, you also need to purchase base coat (step1) and top coat (step 3) to complete manicure. Good luck!</li>
    <li> lasts long. came fast. perfect pink white see through color</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t go back to regular polish again.  I love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Im in the Military and this pink is allowed so i bought it in hopes of feeling like a girl. But If your a woman who sticks her hands in water for anything longer than 5 mins than stay away from this one. It peels right off if you do.</li>
    <li> I did my 1st shellac application tonight with this color.  LOVE it.  I made a few mistakes but I&#x27;m a perfectionist when it comes to nailcare/polish application.  I cannot wait to get more colors of this polish.  It totally beat making or wait for appt and paying close to $40 with tip every tow weeks.</li>
    <li> For a wedding or a classic nail look, this is a great choice.  Depending upon your skin tone, this polish can range from pale white to sheer pink.  Multiple coats will also offer a more opaque look.  Fast ship - quality product.</li>
