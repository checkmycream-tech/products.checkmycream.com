      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product, lots of holiday/</li>
      <li>it all very pretty just the size is bothering me</li>
      <li>it is worth to buy</li>
      <li>But, I am not disappointed in all the nail art designs, some of them are etched really well, others it takes time and precision.</li>
      <li>what i like most about this plate is that some of the patterns have a  left and right  to it</li>
      <li>many different images to choose from!!</li>
      <li>No problem lifting the images off plates, crisp lines.  </li>
      <li>It has so many different holiday designs, which range from christmas to to Valentine&#x27;s day.  </li>
      <li>Tons of cute designs for several holidays.</li>
      <li>I posted a picture to show one of he snowflake designs that came out really pretty.</li>
      <li>the designs are large enough to cover the nail nail and many of them are in both Left and Right!</li>
      <li>and it was pink my favorite color.....</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>The plate has a nice heavy plastic backing</li>
      <li>But, some of them are clean, crisp and consistent while others despite being consistent was messy but transferred okay.&lt;br</li>
      <li>All the images on this plate stamp crisp and clear.</li>
      <li>Bought mainly for the branch designs</li>
      <li>highly recommend</li>
      <li>We have had fun with the different designs and they work well.</li>
      <li>Several are holiday themed, and some are just fun.</li>
      <li>, I love cheeky brand and have other products from them, however shipping took 8 weeks and surprisingly some of the designs transfer messy, which I don&#x27;t find to be the case with their round plates.</li>
      <li>(first two images second line from bottom).</li>
      <li>The plate itself has a backing which is good because the corners of the actually plate is pointy.&lt;br /&gt;For just about $8 you can&#x27;t go wrong despite the fact you get a few other designs; I think the designs amount for the plate is not balanced; meaning this plate is more of a Christmas themed nail art image plate more than a anything else such as Valentine&#x27;s + the Sea</li>
      <li>large specific designs.</li>
      <li>Clear transferable images... would recommend.</li>
      <li>however i must warn you all use sinful colors because no other brand seems to work as a nail polish and the xl stamper</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it was cheap.  :-(</li>

<li> Several reverse images like the other Cheeky plates.  </li>
<li> but when I removed the blue plastic only a few minor scratches but thank goodness; none of the designs were scratched or I would ave been pissed.</li>

<li> I included a few pics for the review.</li>
<li> However, I can&#x27;t tell what a few of them are.  </li>
<li> This is Christmas themed along with a few Valentine&#x27;s such as the cupid, sea; the dolphins and an anchor, flowers and random things.</li>
<li> Very disappointed in this purchase.  </li>

    <li> I think anyone looking for a fun plate, will enjoy this plate.  I have only tried a few of  the patterns and I was very happy with the transfer/stamp.  I like most of the patterns.  However, I can&#x27;t tell what a few of them are.  Also, it took around three weeks to receive my order.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this purchase.  I have Cheeky plates &amp; use with no problem, but this product sucked.  Cute designs, but they don&#x27;t transfer good at all.  I&#x27;m glad it was cheap.  :-(</li>
    <li> what i like most about this plate is that some of the patterns have a  left and right  to it</li>
    <li> Great designs! I posted a picture to show one of he snowflake designs that came out really pretty.</li>
    <li> this is a great plate. The fast that it is from Cheeky makes it good from the start. Wish the images were a bt bigger for longer nails and wider nail bed but over all good. Good engraving and great stamping. got this simple for the holiday stamps. highly recommend</li>
    <li> This plate is awsome.  It has so many different holiday designs, which range from christmas to to Valentine&#x27;s day.  It also has basic designs you can use everyday.</li>
    <li> many different images to choose from!! all different sizes and shapes to choose from!! and different themes (holidays) as well...</li>
    <li> You get a lot of designs with this plate. Several are holiday themed, and some are just fun. I did different colored kisses all over my nails last week, and it only took me about 10 minutes to do all ten nails. I am really enjoying the variety of designs.</li>
    <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. it is just what it describes. large specific designs.</li>
    <li> I find that these plates leave clear, sharp images when using the correct polish. I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; be happier! the designs are large enough to cover the nail nail and many of them are in both Left and Right! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Save me money in the long run on snowflake stickers. This is Christmas themed along with a few Valentine&#x27;s such as the cupid, sea; the dolphins and an anchor, flowers and random things. It&#x27;s a nice plate, at an angle it&#x27;s like a mirror. However, when it came and I opened the packaged there were a few scratches on the blue covering; it got me worried that the actually plate was scratched but when I removed the blue plastic only a few minor scratches but thank goodness; none of the designs were scratched or I would ave been pissed. The plate itself has a backing which is good because the corners of the actually plate is pointy.&lt;br /&gt;For just about $8 you can&#x27;t go wrong despite the fact you get a few other designs; I think the designs amount for the plate is not balanced; meaning this plate is more of a Christmas themed nail art image plate more than a anything else such as Valentine&#x27;s + the Sea + flowers themed plate. But, I am not disappointed in all the nail art designs, some of them are etched really well, others it takes time and precision. But, some of them are clean, crisp and consistent while others despite being consistent was messy but transferred okay.&lt;br /&gt;However, since I had actually brought it for Christmas and it had arrived after Christmas because it was delayed and I never got to use it; I am still happy that I brought it. I will just add this to my seasonal collection. And now, that Valentine&#x27;s day is around the corner; I will get to use it for a season that&#x27;s on it.</li>
    <li> Received image plate L.  Great selection, some holiday items such as gingerbread man, snow man and what appears to be a Halloween one.  Several reverse images like the other Cheeky plates.  Clear transferable images... would recommend.</li>
    <li> Just gorgeous images and high quality plates.</li>
    <li> They have different designs for the Holiday. This plate did stamp Great!! The only thing is the plastic 4 corner edge was pointy, it wasn&#x27;t cut curvy like other Cheeky plates.</li>
    <li> I was trying to use it and it wouldnt pick up til I realized the plastic blue cover had to be stripped off. Great product. Came all the way from China, thats why it took a little long.</li>
    <li> There is a good variety of designs on this plate.  We have had fun with the different designs and they work well.</li>
    <li> All images I tried stamp well. The listed picture shows K, but you receive plate L - with all the same images. Bought mainly for the branch designs (first two images second line from bottom).</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that it is going to be this big but I like the image it all very pretty just the size is bothering me I can store it @ the worked desk at all so I bring it home.</li>
    <li> Me encanto este blato de cheekys en cuanto yego lo trate y muy bien si levanto los disenos...yego en dos semanas y 3 dias</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many images (just the snowflakes) but they transferred beautifully and I love the backing on the plates!</li>
    <li> This is a nice plate. Lots of holiday designs as well as many for just anytime.  There are also quite a bit of reversed images on this plate which is nice.  All the images on this plate stamp crisp and clear.</li>
    <li> These plates are a nice size for stamping.  Almost all stamp well.  No problem lifting the images off plates, crisp lines.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> Just received this for Christmas and I love it! Tons of cute designs for several holidays. I used Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear and Sally Hansen Insta-Dri polishes with it and they stamped perfectly! The plate has a nice heavy plastic backing so no worry about sharp metal edges either. Love it!!</li>
    <li> has not yet reached the product..........................</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product, lots of holiday/seasonal designs, I love cheeky brand and have other products from them, however shipping took 8 weeks and surprisingly some of the designs transfer messy, which I don&#x27;t find to be the case with their round plates. I included a few pics for the review.</li>
    <li> this cheeky plate was an awesome plate and it was pink my favorite color.....however i must warn you all use sinful colors because no other brand seems to work as a nail polish and the xl stamper and i tell you this it is worth to buy that nail polish and stamper take it from someone who has tried it all and these always work with everything....and the images come out beautiful.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Designs are detailed, great for accenting one or  more fingers. Very happy</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast delivery. A+ Seller! Thank you!</li>
    <li> all if the images on this plate worked great with the konad polish. my plate was slightly bent but it did not affect the effectiveness of the plate. I would buy more of this brand.</li>
