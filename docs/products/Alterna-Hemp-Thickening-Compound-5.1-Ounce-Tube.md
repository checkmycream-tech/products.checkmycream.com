      <li>awesome stuff!  </li>
      <li>This product has been a wonderful styling asset in my curly hair care.  </li>
      <li>This product had great reviews, so I decided to give it a go.</li>
      <li>and I have great results.</li>
      <li>I had to buy this product after reading all the great reviews however, it did nothing to my hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to make your hair silky and make layers look great.  </li>
      <li>This product is excellent, and I love using it.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>A great product for fine hair, curly hair or hair that tends to get frizzy.</li>
      <li>My hair felt so amazing</li>
      <li>It smells nice but for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I say no.</li>
      <li>I gave this product two stars instead of one because it does smell nice, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy, sticky, or crunchy.</li>
      <li>It truly is one of a kind.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m in love :)</li>
      <li>After I get out of the shower I put about a quarter size of this product in my hair and make sure I put it everywhere.  </li>
      <li>This product does everything it claims and more.</li>
      <li>In addition to more body, my layers looked better and the frizzies were gone.</li>
      <li>Yup, no hair dryer needed to activate this product :).</li>
      <li>But I kept using it, because I know most products need time to start working correctly.  </li>
      <li>I discovered this product when my hairdresser used it on my hair before a blowout and loved it so much, I had to buy it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years now and love how much body it adds to my very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>i have fine hair...</li>
      <li>The scent is very light and fresh too.</li>
      <li>Great on thin, fly away hair.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a few years and always found it to be the best out there.</li>
      <li>I plan to stock up while it is still available.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who has: limp/flat hair, split ends or fly aways, or just wants fuller healthier looking and feeling hair.</li>
      <li>You only have to use the tinyest amount to acheive great styling and full body.  </li>
      <li>but, this one is not bad.  </li>
      <li>When I first started using this product, I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
      <li>The next day at work I got so many compliments on my hair!</li>
      <li>definitely worth the $$$....</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, so on days I want my hair to have extra volume/height</li>
      <li>On it&#x27;s own, it really just adds softness, control, and an overall \\&quot;good\\&quot; feeling to your hair.</li>
      <li>I wash and set or wash and let it dry on it&#x27;s own and to my surprise just a dab</li>
      <li>I have to use an additional volumizing spray foam (Big Sexy Hair or Redken Guts)</li>
      <li>However, I found that if I use just a tiny bit the results are okay.</li>
      <li>This product has changed since I first began using it.</li>
      <li>I have super fine hair and this makes it smooth and silky without weighing it down at all!</li>
      <li>Similar plastic container, but the ones I got were labeled 4.9 ounces, and the inside goop was a different color and consistency from the one I loved a year ago and wanted to replace.</li>
      <li>So what I&#x27;m saying is, this is a subtle, but very effective product.</li>
      <li>but it certainly helps.   </li>
      <li>My hair is a little over shoulder length, and a little on the fine side, so some added thickness would have been great.</li>
      <li>I have short, fine hair, and this hair creme is a miracle worker.</li>
      <li>It just makes my hair feel so much healthier and nicer.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon...</li>
      <li>The product makes my hair much easier to comb after Ii wash it.  </li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
      <li>* Alterna Hemp, please get your costs under control so you can keep offering your consumers the reasonable prices you used to.&lt;br /&gt;BR,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in thickness.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and makes your hair soft but as far as thickening it fell short.</li>
      <li>Plus, a little goes a long way, and it has a nice, light smell.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, it&#x27;s a pretty light weight product, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, nor does it cause it to produce any more oil than normal.</li>
      <li>The best volumizers I&#x27;ve found so far are those powders that feel slightly cold and tacky when you&#x27;re putting them in</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sorry I purchased three tubes, but I was worried that it would be discontinued all together, like so many of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>My fine hair had more volume, softness and style without feeling \\&quot;weighed down\\&quot; or heavy like other thickening products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>this makes it super soft and it feels thick and strong...</li>
      <li>I was skeptical if I could recreate the hair greatness on my own, but I found this product very reasonably priced on Amazon</li>
      <li>I like the light scent (almost like baby lotion), and I have to wash my hair daily, and then I blow dry it, which dries the ends out, and this product is helping to keep my hair shiny and soft from scalp to ends.</li>
      <li>I have straight, fine, oily hair and wanted a product to help thicken it, or at least give it the appearance of being thicker.</li>
      <li>I have dry, fine hair but lots of it and live in a dry climate.</li>
      <li>My hair remains soft, and the curls retain definition.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair, it makes it shinny and full.</li>
      <li>Because you don&#x27;t need to use much, the tube lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair and was hoping that it would texturize the hair somewhat.  </li>

    <li> This is AMAZING!!! I had my hair done at a resort in Phoenix, AZ and she used this product. My hair felt so amazing I had to get it.  I was skeptical if I could recreate the hair greatness on my own, but I found this product very reasonably priced on Amazon so I bought it.  The next day at work I got so many compliments on my hair! I have thick hair so once my hair is completely dry, I put a little bit of this product on my hands and run it through my hair.   Then I blow it dry using heat for just a minute or so and it&#x27;s all set.  This is a great product to make your hair silky and make layers look great.  The hairdresser told me that for thinner hair, this product should be applied on wet hair.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product, I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference. But I kept using it, because I know most products need time to start working correctly.  I have very fine hair, so on days I want my hair to have extra volume/height I have to use an additional volumizing spray foam (Big Sexy Hair or Redken Guts) and I have great results. On it&#x27;s own, it really just adds softness, control, and an overall \\&quot;good\\&quot; feeling to your hair. I also like that it protects from heat damage.  After using it for about 3 weeks, I stopped using it. And noticed an immediate difference. So what I&#x27;m saying is, this is a subtle, but very effective product. I don&#x27;t plan to stop using this again. It just makes my hair feel so much healthier and nicer.  I can compare it to Living Proof Full Thickening Cream, but a lot less expensive. Works just as well, if not better.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have thin wavy hair.  After I get out of the shower I put about a quarter size of this product in my hair and make sure I put it everywhere.  Then I dry as usual...awesome stuff!  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair thicker permanently but it works when you use it! Love it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately when hair was handed out in the heavens- someone thought I asked for cotton candy and I was blessed with not a-lot of it TEAR~TEAR.   I wash and set or wash and let it dry on it&#x27;s own and to my surprise just a dab will hold my curl/style all day. When my perm starts to dwindle this product works also, no it does not give me the thick flowing hair I would like chuckle chuckle but it certainly helps.   I don&#x27;t blow dry but I think this product would work just as well. Now you know my sad hair story but at least there are products that help.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when my hairdresser used it on my hair before a blowout and loved it so much, I had to buy it. My fine hair had more volume, softness and style without feeling \\&quot;weighed down\\&quot; or heavy like other thickening products I&#x27;ve tried. In addition to more body, my layers looked better and the frizzies were gone. The scent is very light and fresh too. I usually use it when my hair is wet or damp, before blow drying or rollers. It works on dry hair too, but I&#x27;ve found using it on damp or wet hair before a blow out makes my hair the fullest. Because you don&#x27;t need to use much, the tube lasts a long time. A great product for fine hair, curly hair or hair that tends to get frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have straight, fine, oily hair and wanted a product to help thicken it, or at least give it the appearance of being thicker. This product had great reviews, so I decided to give it a go. I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in thickness. Maybe I&#x27;m applying it incorrectly, I dunno? On the other hand, it&#x27;s a pretty light weight product, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, nor does it cause it to produce any more oil than normal. I like the light scent (almost like baby lotion), and I have to wash my hair daily, and then I blow dry it, which dries the ends out, and this product is helping to keep my hair shiny and soft from scalp to ends. So, up to this point I say 4 stars...</li>
    <li> I gave this product two stars instead of one because it does smell nice, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy, sticky, or crunchy. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me. My hair is still flat and limp after I use it.</li>
    <li> I have short, fine hair, and this hair creme is a miracle worker. I put it in my hair after I shower and let my hair air dry, and that&#x27;s it! Yup, no hair dryer needed to activate this product :). My hair is thicker, fuller, and stays that way all day. Plus, a little goes a long way, and it has a nice, light smell. I will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for five years and now it has been discontinued. I plan to stock up while it is still available.</li>
    <li> This product has been a wonderful styling asset in my curly hair care.  My hair remains soft, and the curls retain definition.</li>
    <li> I started using Alterna&#x27;s hemp thickening compound after my hairstylist suggested I try it. Now I use it after every shampoo before blow drying. It is concentrated so you only need a dime sized amount for shoulder length hair. I have super fine hair and this makes it smooth and silky without weighing it down at all! It smells wonderful too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Alterna![[ASIN:B001AMQJ84 Alterna Hemp Thickening Compound, 5.1-Ounce Tube]]</li>
    <li> i have fine hair...this makes it super soft and it feels thick and strong...i will continue using...definitely worth the $$$....i&#x27;m in love :)</li>
    <li> This product has changed since I first began using it. However, I found that if I use just a tiny bit the results are okay. I&#x27;m sorry I purchased three tubes, but I was worried that it would be discontinued all together, like so many of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I usually hate gels of all sorts but, this one is not bad.  Great on thin, fly away hair.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and have not found any other product that compares. It truly is one of a kind.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it claims and more. I highly recommend it for anyone who has: limp/flat hair, split ends or fly aways, or just wants fuller healthier looking and feeling hair.</li>

    <li> This product is excellent, and I love using it.  The product makes my hair much easier to comb after Ii wash it.  I had a difficult time finding it because the beauty supply house stopped carrying it.  Since I was desperate, I found it on Amazon.  Thanks Amazon...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years now and love how much body it adds to my very fine hair.  You only have to use the tinyest amount to acheive great styling and full body.  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this made my hair look or feel any differently than it does without any product. The best volumizers I&#x27;ve found so far are those powders that feel slightly cold and tacky when you&#x27;re putting them in and then you don&#x27;t feel them at all. I have dry, fine hair but lots of it and live in a dry climate.</li>
    <li> Similar plastic container, but the ones I got were labeled 4.9 ounces, and the inside goop was a different color and consistency from the one I loved a year ago and wanted to replace.

    <li> I have been using this product for a few years and always found it to be the best out there. It doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair, it makes it shinny and full. Unfortunately, I just went on Amazon to purchase another tube and found that the price trippled since my June purchase. It went from something like $17 to over $47 dollars! What happened?&lt;br /&gt;*** Alterna Hemp, please get your costs under control so you can keep offering your consumers the reasonable prices you used to.&lt;br /&gt;BR,  Boom</li>
