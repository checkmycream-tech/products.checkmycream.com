<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If you saw my perfume counter in my master bathroom, you&#x27;d see over 50 high-end department store perfumes that I spent thousands of dollars on.  And this is after giving about 20 bottles away to friends recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good friend of mine gave this to me for my birthday last June.  I immediately fell in love with the scent.  (It&#x27;s sort of like a light Cool Water blended with Body by Victoria&#x27;s Secret BUT MUCH BETTER.)  I quickly ran out and panicked because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I came here and was disappointed about some of the reviews saying it was &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;not the same&amp;#34; and I was worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I bought it (since I had no other options) and I was really pleased that I did, in fact, get the same perfume I had before (and ran out of) and this continues to be my favorite scent.  (I actually feel a little guilty as I look over my sea of perfume bottles every morning when I reach ONLY for this one and none of the other ones.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be happy with this.  It&#x27;s a nice scent.  It&#x27;s not overbearing.  It&#x27;s feminine, clean, delicate...and purely awesome.  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I love the fresh scent in a beautiful bottle.  This is my second bottle ordered.  It is my favorite fragrance</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, but S &amp; H was ridiculous!  I don&#x27;t expect it to be free, but it costs almost half the price of the bottle of perfume....Just expected it to be a bit more reasonable.</li>
    <li> Product came fully packaged and new</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase and even more the shipper. I will be sure next time I need to purchase I will shop with them.</li>
    <li> Easy purchase, but did arrive a bit late.  However, this is now my wife&#x27;s (and mine) favorite perfume.  Will surely buy this again.  Checked prices a local stores, and we saved a bunch.</li>
    <li> Great.....arrived quickly</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and besides that the cost was the best of all and was free shipping</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance would definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> Great perfume! Clean and crisp, smells wonderful all day. I get more compliments on this than any other perfume I wear.</li>
    <li> This did not smell anything like the one I had previously purchased at a department store.</li>
    <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;This scent is marvelous. Fresh and clean but not linen smelling at all. Feminine. It gets lots of compliments from both men and women. Compliments many different body chemistries, I have let many friends and family members sample it. Pretty packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;The scent dwindles and fades after about 3 hours. And its not just on me, its on everyone I know who has tried it. I carry it around in my purse, because I have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
    <li> It smelled off and the color was wrong. I worry that it&#x27;s counterfeit.</li>
    <li> I wrote this review because my daughter just loved it.....I will be ordering it again for her.  She said this was her bet gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this, and it is the real product. It just doesn&#x27;t last long on the skin. It&#x27;s my second purchase though because the scent is just perfect.</li>
    <li> True Religion turned out to be Great once we received it from the USPS. Highly recommend this purchase so it ended up not being a disappointment!</li>
    <li> True Religion is my favorite perfume of all time, so I was skeptical buying it online for more than half the price.  I ordered this product and was expecting the worst. It came packaged in its original packaging (looked legit, but I will never know). The first spray was disappointing because it smelled old, like it may have been fake. But as I started using it more and more, it started smelling \\&quot;right\\&quot; again. It&#x27;s legit True Religion perfume, and it smells GREAT. I get compliments often, my boyfriend loves it.  It&#x27;s a HUGE bottle, and I&#x27;m looking to buy my second after 6 months of use! :)</li>
    <li> True Religion is my favorite perfume. They discontinued making it and it is only available online. I am so thankful I can still buy this online. I got so many compliments when I wear it!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product And It Is Really The First True Religion Women&#x27;s Frangance Which Is My Favorite</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this stuff in about six months, but when I heard it was discontinued I went on a wild hunt! I bought one from Amazon and two from our Perfumania store in the mall. All three bottles have the identical trademarked sticker on the bottom of the bottle. I don&#x27;t know if the quality is what it was years ago.. but it still smells good. Crisp and Clean scent. Love the price for the bottle size as well. From my experience I&#x27;d like to think this is the real stuff, but I think it&#x27;s just one of those products you&#x27;ll have to judge for yourself. Overall I&#x27;m glad I purchased. Very fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Smell is not quite right. Maybe it&#x27;s me</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, great price, came in quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I purchased it for my daughter who also loves it. I thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume. It smells amazing and stays on all day! Recommend it to all my friends!!</li>
    <li> To be honest, I love bling! so this bottle of parfum caught my eye!  But it has a very pleasant scent also! Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, one of my favorites. Came exactly like when i buy it at department stores only wayyyyyy cheaper yay!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume! I am very picky about perfumes.  I don&#x27;t like strong or sweet smelling perfumes. This one is quaint and clean smelling.  It arrived promtly and in great shape.</li>
    <li> Didnt smell right, smelled old. Shipped fast and new in the box but dont wanna deal with returning it</li>
    <li> my wife loves this perfume</li>
    <li> Great perfume with a clean light scent</li>
    <li> The fragrance is a great fragrance...not heavy or over powering.  My dislike is that after a few hours I can&#x27;t smell it any longer.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. It smells AMAZING!! The bottle is exactly what it looks like in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It smells amazing. I was looking for this in stores because I had bought it before, and when I was unable to locate this item in stores, I found it on amazon and bought it. Smells just as good as the in-store product.</li>
    <li> Did not smell like my sample at all. Was discolored and the smell was so awful. They say that the perfume isnt old but im not so sure. Bought the exact same one from a different seller and that one smells great. Not sure what happened here but I wont buy from again.</li>
    <li> NOT THE ORIGINAL. I have been using this fragrance for about 5 years now. I compared it to my other bottle (which is still half full) and the liquid is yellowish and smells horrible. Not even close to the original. It smells like a cleaning product or something and I had to spray something else over it because it was giving me a headache and making me sick. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!! Very dissatisfied. Would give it 0 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> It did not last and it seemed to be fake.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product 👍</li>
    <li> A gift that was requested by recipient who is very happy!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.  It&#x27;s too bad it&#x27;s so hard to find...</li>
    <li> she loved it! 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! This was a great price for it!!</li>
    <li> Its not true religion. Its fake.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t purchased this scent in a couple of years and I was disappointed to find out the department stores don&#x27;t carry it any more.  I was so happy to find it still available on Amazon, and it&#x27;s the real stuff, not a counterfeit - smells just as good as I remember!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! This is the authentic True Religion perfume at a great price! Hard to find as this perfume has been discontinued</li>
    <li> Wonderfully light fragrance, appropriate for an office setting etc. Reminds me of summertime with  slight citrus undertones. I bought another bottle after I first tried and immediately loved the fragrance.</li>
    <li> The perfume is old.  It has a strange yellow color compared to the bottle purchased in a store last year.  It also has an alcohol smell instead of the amazing smell it&#x27;s supposed to have.  We compared it to the little amount we had left in our old bottle.  I&#x27;d actually like a refund!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say hate it but wouldn&#x27;t say it was the correct smell as true religion is. I will not be purchasing this perfume online again!</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance ever!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, and was happy to find it on Amazon since it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  Bought two!</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s signature fragrance.  Glad we found it as hard to find in the area we live in.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about having a perfume shipped to me, but when I when I got it, it was packed very well. It barely moved in the box and FragranceNet even included different perfume samples, coupons and 2 awesome little mirrors! Hands down the best product I have purchased from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Came fairly quick but it was WAY cheaper than at the perfume store anywhere here in town so no complaints!! Have been wearing  this scent for years now and I love it but it&#x27;s 50 plus dollars in town and now that I found it cheaper here I&#x27;m super happy and it&#x27;s worth waiting for. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Huge bottle! Absolutely the best value! This is my favorite perfume and to fine such an amazing price was almost too good to be true. Shipping was delayed but it was due to the package re-routed by the post office not the shipper. Will never buy perfume anywhere else again!</li>
    <li> OK so I read most of the reviews after purchasing this item.... Bad idea I know! This was the first thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on amazon or online in general for that matter. I must say I am happy with the purchase.  I bought this for my mother. She had gotten me some for Christmas and then found out after smelling it on me that she really liked it. Some reviews say it smells bad and not like the department store bottles.  As I said before I read the reviews after purchase so I was going nuts wondering if I made the right choice, especially considering the price was so cheap. Well it is a great buy! The price and quality are amazing.  My mother is very happy with it too! My only complaint is the shipping took forever. ...I ordered a phone off of Amazon 6 days after the perfume and they both arrived the same day. I chose standard shipping for both. I mean it got here within the time they estimated but my phone came in way faster.</li>
    <li> Hate the smell I&#x27;ll never use it :(</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent. I get more compliments with this on than anything else.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, glad I was able to find it for a decent price. The smell is very nice but not overwhelming and lasts for hours, I get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical on purchasing perfume online because I was afraid of receiving an item that was not real.  I have been using this scent for 4+ years and after sparying it on once, I knew immediately that it was not real.  In addition, anyone using this scent for a prolong period of time will know that even the color of the fragrance of nothing compared to the real thing.  The color of this fragrance shippied by this company was very transparent whereras the real thing is not.  I purchased this scent from this company after reading several good reviews but I am going to return this item and I urge other customers to pleasebe cautious of getting this perfume through this company.</li>
    <li> Great light clean smell. Great price too.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite fragrance! I actually wasn&#x27;t able to find it at Ulta so decided to try ordering it... came super fast!</li>
    <li> Loved it back when it first came out.  Looked for it in the regular stores and since it was not available came to you.  Thanks for still having it!</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE BOTTLE AND THE BOX.... THE SCENT SUCKS!</li>
    <li> I love True Religion perfume.  I get compliments on it everytime I wear it.  It is not over powering or too strong and it can seem to fade quite a bit over the course of the day but I think I&#x27;m just used to it.  My husband loves it so thats a plus.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I get complements all the time on the smell of this perfume, everyone seems to love it. Bottle is nice too.</li>
