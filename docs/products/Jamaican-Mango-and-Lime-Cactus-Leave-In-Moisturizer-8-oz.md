      <li>I like this product because it makes my hair look healthy and clean.  </li>

      <li>When I started my current set, I remembered the good experiences that I had with this product and sought it out again.</li>

      <li>, here&#x27;s the ingredients from the new formula:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I recommend this product to anyone thats gone natural.</li>
      <li>I got tired of trying to make my own products and gave this a try.  </li>
      <li>my dreads are much healthier before they were dry</li>
      <li>This is the only product my 7 year old AA daughter will let me put on her hair/head.</li>
      <li>It causes, rather than eliminates frizziness and has a runny consistency, versus the original, which was a thick</li>
      <li>Harmful to natural African American hair.</li>
      <li>Some still swear by it, but it just feels strange on my hair, I&#x27;ll stick with the old Jojoba oil + Water</li>
      <li>This is the only moisturizer so far that allows me to comb my hair while dry (when I initially put it on there).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is really good. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy and blends right into your hair. I have Locs and this product helps add moisture to them. I recommend this to anyone with Locs or wears their hair natural.</li>
    <li> This goop seemed to have promise for our dreaddies, but I found it to be overly drying and ended up leaving tons of flakes in my hair.  Bummer.  Also, the packaging wasn&#x27;t so hot and the conditioner leaked all over the bag.  My favorite conditioner continues to be Sher Essence&#x27;s on ebay.</li>
    <li> I dont have dreads, I a very thick kinky long natural fro and my hair gets very dry.  I got tired of trying to make my own products and gave this a try.  This is the only moisturizer so far that allows me to comb my hair while dry (when I initially put it on there).  Usually the only time I can comb my hair is after I shampoo with tons of conditioner, and even then my hair gets very tangled.  This stuff is a must have.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my locks. Washing them is an effort to dry (they are long) and I don&#x27;t want to do it more frequently than I do. This does double duty of adding no residue sheen to my locks as well as lightly perfuming them in between washes.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It is so moisturizing and leaves my lox bouncy! I even bought some for my mother in law who does not have lox and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s actually great I use it everyday my dreads are much healthier before they were dry and I had a lot of breakage but now this conditioner works non stop</li>
    <li> Ingredients changed..  product contained a lot of man made material. Harmful to natural African American hair. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product in the future</li>
    <li> When you 1st get your locks this was my go to stuff. It&#x27;s cooling and made most of the itching stop on contact. Love it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have locks (dreads) and I wanted a product to keep my hair moist in between washes and oiling...this works great...it last all day and it&#x27;s non-greasy and very light...it also has a nice smell...would recommend it...</li>
    <li> For my locs keeps themm maintained</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dread&#x27;s for about a year &amp; this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that you can use as often as you want. It&#x27;s really light with just a faint sent of lime. It works great if you have the frizzies, or right after you wash and shampoo as a leave in conditioner. Absolutely the perfect product for dread&#x27;s. One suggestion to the manufacturer... Make a larger size!!!</li>
    <li> Another reviewer echoed my sentiments about this once great product. I was fortunate enough to have discovered this moisturizer quite a few years ago, on my first loc journey. When I started my current set, I remembered the good experiences that I had with this product and sought it out again. Imagine my disappointment when I looked at the ingredients on the new bottle. For comparison, I&#x27;ll list the ingredients from the original formula first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cactus blend extract, cactus blossom, cactus seed extract, cactus root extract, cactus flower oil, carrot oil, tea tree oil, shea butter, aloe, jojoba oil, essence of lime, essence of mango, mtehylparaben and fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s the ingredients from the new formula:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deionized water, mineral oil, gylcerin, glycol disterate, polyquaternium 37, propylene glycol, diazolydiniyl urea, methylparaben, propylparaben, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my question is: How can they even use the name Cactus on the label anymore? I will not be using this product anymore, as long as they are being so deceptive with their labeling. Shame on the company for ruining a once great product line, all in the name of using cheaper ingredients. I don&#x27;t hold out hope that they will change it back, so I am now searching for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has none of the quality of the original, and leaves my dreads oily, not moist. It causes, rather than eliminates frizziness and has a runny consistency, versus the original, which was a thick lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this useless garbage. The only positive is that it still smells good.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo at great price compared to dread head products. Would recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m like What-the-BLANK Happened!!??!!  This product received so many great reviews from everybody who has ever styled their hair in dreads or curls, I broke down and tried it (about 3years too late)... The formulary has changed, and unfortunately, so has the product.  Some still swear by it, but it just feels strange on my hair, I&#x27;ll stick with the old Jojoba oil + Water leave-in (or just plain Aloe) thank you very much. But, then also, maybe I used it wrong... I don&#x27;t know, the product and the reviews just don&#x27;t match up anymore. Sorry guys F--</li>
    <li> I like this product because it makes my hair look healthy and clean.  It has a good smell and you can use it everyday. I get compliments all the time about how healthy my hair looks. I have dreds and it doesn&#x27;t look frizzie and unmanaged.  Thanks Jamaican Mango Lime Moisturizer, love the way you make my hair looks. I recommend this product to anyone thats gone natural. Great product!</li>
    <li> It makes you dreads smell very nice.</li>
    <li> Great product. It really help my 4C hair</li>
    <li> This is the only product my 7 year old AA daughter will let me put on her hair/head. She complains that everything else we&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;itches&amp;#34; her scalp. She and her brother have very tightly coiled hair that that is very dry and brittle.  Thank goodness I have found this product.</li>
