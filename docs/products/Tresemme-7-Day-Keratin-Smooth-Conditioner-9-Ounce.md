### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>On that packaging it recommended that it be used with the 7-day shampoo &amp; conditioner for best results.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with that!</li>
      <li>excellent product!</li>
      <li>My hair smells great!</li>
      <li>Very happy with that!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great , it smells SO GOOD !!</li>
      <li>think her hair is beautiful</li>
      <li>Great stuff.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use this conditioner with the corresponding shampoo and treatment, which might be why I didn&#x27;t see a great effect from the conditioner.</li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>Best of all, if you have access, is using a heat bonnet, but most of us don&#x27;t have those.</li>
      <li>and she is thrilled!</li>
      <li>Okay, time to talk about the amazing details, ladies &amp; gents, the shine it brought to my hair was BRILLIANT!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted that this worked so well for me.  </li>
      <li>I have loved this product.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with that option.</li>
      <li>My hair is very smooth after using this!</li>
      <li>I wish this worked because I usually love this brand and the concept sounds great, but</li>
      <li>Of course the smoothness, no-fly aways, no crazy frizz made this a perfect 10 for me but the shine is what has made me a forever user of this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love reading!</li>
      <li>I am so happy to say this product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>and it does not have a particularly nice smell.  </li>
      <li>Nonetheless, I liked the conditioner and would buy it on my own.</li>
      <li>I had already gotten the Tresemme 7-day heat activated treatment and really liked the result.  </li>
      <li>, this conditioner smells good and smooths on easily.  </li>
      <li>What is great is that this conditioner claims also to work through three washes and I have had success with that as well.  </li>
      <li>and leaves my hair smooth , straight and with a great smell !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and not too overbearing.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;For more salon secrets,</li>
      <li>I also love the scent.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t buy again, but glad I tried it.</li>
      <li>Now, I know this is nothing but marketing, but since I did like the results I got with the heat activated treatment I wondered how much more I would like the result if I got the Keratin shampoo and conditioneer and let them all work togther as suggested?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>I put heat to it at most 1-3 days a month.</li>
      <li>love it.  </li>
      <li>I love it :)</li>
      <li>My daughter, like me, tends to go into sneezing fits with many scented products.  </li>
      <li>These have been just fantastic!</li>
      <li>Keratin is the protein that is found in everyone&#x27;s hair and nails and even skin, so adding to your routine should make your hair look better and even become stronger after time.</li>
      <li>I have to say, I really love it.</li>
      <li>My next appointment is scheduled for the end of March, so this product came for review at the perfect time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>conditioning ability was pretty good.</li>

      <li>when purchasing shampoo I was able to order the Tresemme keratin smooth conditioner as an add on.</li>
      <li>Yes, but not to those that dislike things with strong smells.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner is designed to be used as part of the Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth line, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I used it with the shampoo and was amazed that a product at this price point could deliver such great results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>STEP 5: Continue to use 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo and Conditioner throughout the week.</li>
      <li>I hoped TRESEMME 7 DAY KERATIN SMOOTH CONDITIONER; 9 OUNCE would do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I proudly acknowledge that I haven&#x27;t the foggiest idea as to what is actually *</li>
      <li>Follow with 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s important to mention this.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy post-wash durability, smoothness, and convenient re-styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I generally have been very impressed with Tresemme&#x27;s new line of products.</li>
      <li>Being new to Keratin products in general, I&#x27;m very impressed with how well the Tresemme system works.</li>
      <li>Do note that my hair for the most part has most of its split ends around 2 inches from the ends, which is where my hair normally gets stuck in knots.</li>

      <li>And, although the price is super cheap, this may be one of those instances of \\&quot;You</li>
      <li>This product did make my hair shiny and smooth but it also made me lose more than normal during brushing.  </li>
      <li>I love this whole line of TRESemme products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if there was a really difference</li>
      <li>I left it on for a good 5 minutes and rinsed out.</li>
      <li>I left it on for a good 5 minutes and rinsed out.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure</li>
      <li>now, I&#x27;m planning on using this as a weekly hair treatment -- every Sunday night so that my hair is fresh and smooth for work on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair straight and silky for a week or more.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner features ThermaFlex Technology which combines unique conditioning and strengthening polymers to create a smooth, more manageable hairstyle that resists humidity while remaining soft and manageable between washes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The next day, my hair was very smooth and I&#x27;d say about 90% less frizzy, which is a great improvement!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The next day, my hair was very smooth and I&#x27;d say about 90% less frizzy, which is a great improvement!</li>
      <li>this product, I did not notice any smoothing effect (but it is summer and super humid).</li>
      <li>FIRST IMPRESSION (6/17/2014) ----&lt;br /&gt;I started with the Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>I used it along with my normal shampoo and was pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I can only imagine it would be better if you were using it for it&#x27;s intended use!  </li>
      <li>If you have straight fine hair don&#x27;t use this.</li>
      <li>If you are the fussy type to whom that appeals, enjoy the whole process, but I will not.  </li>
      <li>This product had a fresh scent and did offer medium conditioning.</li>
      <li>I left my hair wrapped up in my towel while my hair was still warm.</li>
      <li>I have had as much success with Garnier Fructis products as I have Moroccan products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;With its moisture-enhanced formula, TRESemm&amp;eacute; 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner gently conditions women&#x27;s hair to help create smooth, frizz-resistant styles that last for up to 7 days* when used with TRESemm&amp;eacute; 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo and TRESemm&amp;eacute; 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment.</li>
      <li>heard some good things about keratin treatment for hair, especially for my hair type, but I was hesitant about trying it because I&#x27;ve read some cons about keratin -- too much of it can put &amp;</li>
      <li>I left my hair wrapped up in my towel while my hair was still warm.</li>
      <li>However, I am on to other Tresseme products, and have been a loyal customer for more years than I care to count!</li>
      <li>In general, I&#x27;ve been pleased with Tresemme&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
      <li>Though being an &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; product, I have found it to be better than many pro formulas I can only obtain at professional supply stores...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s better used without the Keratin Smooth Shampoo; maybe finer hair can only stand so much keratin.</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t particularly expensive and might be worth a try, but I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with it.</li>
      <li>So with that in mind, and my great success with Tresemme products in the past, I was really looking forward to trying this 7 day stuff</li>
      <li>very nice smell, enough for several months&#x27; use.</li>
      <li>I know companies like us using every product in a specific line because they formulated it to work together, but the product should be able to stand alone--</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have tried Tresemme shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used salon products for 30 years including Wen, Big Sexy, Aveda and Pureology.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this whole line of TRESemme products.</li>
    <li> I found out too late that some people&#x27;s hair cannot withstand Keratin.  This product did make my hair shiny and smooth but it also made me lose more than normal during brushing.  Use cautiously... product works but some people have a reaction to Keratin.  Google it to understand why.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great , it smells SO GOOD !! and leaves my hair smooth , straight and with a great smell !</li>
    <li> I honestly saw no difference in my hair after using this product vs. my usual (Kirkland Signature Professional Salon Formula Moisture Conditioner). To me, this was a tiny quantity of conditioner at a high price. Won&#x27;t buy again, but glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Tresemme 7 day keratin smooth conditioner leaves our hair thick and feeling sleek and &amp;#34;stronger.&amp;#34; My hair in particular is shinier than before use. I was looking for something to stop frizzies as well, and long term use has reduced frizziness in humid weather.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and needs little conditioner except when I have been working outside for several days.  This conditioner is thick and does a good job of repairing damage, but it is quite oily feeling, even after rinsing.  As a conditioner for damaged hair, I recommend it, but for daily use it is a bit too much.  It also calls for you to use another product after the conditioner, blow dry, and iron your hair.  If you are the fussy type to whom that appeals, enjoy the whole process, but I will not.  I will continue to use it occasionally for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I cannot comment on how this specialized conditioner would work in conjunction with the other Tresemme products that it is designed to accompany.  But as a stand-alone conditioner, it applied smoothly, had a pleasant scent, was easy to rinse out, and left my hair feeling good.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried Tresemme shampoo and conditioner. I have to say, I really love it. It is so rich and creamy and a little bit goes a long way. I also love the scent. It&#x27;s very light and not too overbearing. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy like some conditioners, which is a big plus since I have baby fine hair. I like this shampoo and conditioner so much that I think I will probably be switching from my old shampoo and conditioner to Tresemme.</li>
    <li> I have combination hair, some areas smooth and straight, and other areas thick with body. This conditioner makes my hair uniformly textured, and tames the frizz out of the body. My sister has really thick hair, and she has to have it professionally straightened and thinned. I recommended this product to her and she is thrilled! She can extend the time between expensive treatments by using this conditioner.  This product is intended to be used with a flat iron at home, but I find it has a smoothing/straightening effect with just the heat of a hair dryer (further saving additional wear and tear on my hair).  I highly recommend this conditioner to anyone who has hair with too much frizz, uncontrollable body. You’ll have less chemical and heat damage to hair and can also avoid the over-limp effects some “de-frizzing “ conditioners have on your hair. (FYI, I still use a de-frizzing gel after shampooing/conditioning).</li>
    <li> My hair is very smooth after using this! very nice smell, enough for several months&#x27; use. will order again if out.</li>
    <li> I generally have been very impressed with Tresemme&#x27;s new line of products. They&#x27;re of high quality and very reasonably priced. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t really say that the former is true in the case of this Keratin Smooth Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner smells terrible and doesn&#x27;t worth well with my fairly fine hair that sees a lot of chlorine abuse. There&#x27;s a ton of instructions for the optimization of this product, but I question how necessarily/effective they are. Whichever way you use this, the results aren&#x27;t extraordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which results in a product that conditions, but not better than anything else you might go out of your way to purchase. This product isn&#x27;t particularly expensive and might be worth a try, but I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with it.</li>
    <li> (I tried the shampoo and conditioner at the same time, so there will be a little bit of cross pollinating for each review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keratin is a magic word for people with ultra dry hair like mine. When it comes to marketing hair products, &amp;#34;keratin&amp;#34; is used as a Symbol of Instant Results almost as much as argan oil is. So with that in mind, and my great success with Tresemme products in the past, I was really looking forward to trying this 7 day stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it seemed to glide over my hair and leave nothing in its wake. I could feel it mock my thirsty strands while it slide off without improving the feel and, eventually, look of my hair. I followed the directions, I swear! I love reading! I know companies like us using every product in a specific line because they formulated it to work together, but the product should be able to stand alone-- especially if you pair both the conditioner and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular Tresemme shampoo and conditioner does a LOT more for my hair than this line, my hair was as dry and unmanageable as it is if I use the stuff from the 99 cent store. I wish this worked because I usually love this brand and the concept sounds great, but eh. This conditioner was super weak sauce, even rinsing it out was kind of depressing when I could feel my hair reacting to the humidity of the shower as if I used nothing on it.</li>
    <li> Being new to Keratin products in general, I&#x27;m very impressed with how well the Tresemme system works. Using the three products together makes a big difference, and they really do work as a regime. If you want to REALLY up your game, leave the conditioner in and wrap your hair in a towel, letting the heat of your head warm the conditioner into your hair&#x27;s shaft. Best of all, if you have access, is using a heat bonnet, but most of us don&#x27;t have those. Give it 30 minutes and rinse and you&#x27;ll be shocked at how deliciously soft your hair is.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was developed to help smooth down hair that is being heat-straightened, and to help keep it smooth from washing to washing.  I thought I&#x27;d try it, even though I curl my hair, because - especially in summer humidity - my hair gets frizzy.  I have seen a big difference, my hair maintains the style without getting the frizzy ends, stays much smoother.  I can only imagine it would be better if you were using it for it&#x27;s intended use!  I have been using it with the accompanying shampoo and will look for these products again.</li>
    <li> My hair is color treated, curly/wavy and long. When I use a conditioner, it must function as a detangler first and foremost, or anything else it offers is useless to me. Well, while I would certainly not call this Tresseme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditoner useless, it did not perform well enough for me to consider going out to get more. Sorry, Tresseme -- I love your other products. I will use this tube to the bitter end, and if I find a change in my opinion after my initial multiple usage, I will update. However, I am on to other Tresseme products, and have been a loyal customer for more years than I care to count!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last two weeks, shampooing and conditioning every other day, and when I stye my hair with thermal aids (either a flat iron or hot rollers) my results have been smooth and lasting. Full disclosure: I did not use the companion shampoo that was suggested on the product information, nor did I follow with the companion &amp;#34;Treatment&amp;#34; because I received the conditioner through the Vine program, and wasn&#x27;t offered the other products. Nonetheless, I liked the conditioner and would buy it on my own. Pleasing scent--not a heavy floral. My hair smells great!</li>
    <li> This product definitely adds shine to my hair, but I found it also made my hair slightly limp, and it didn&#x27;t stay as clean between shampoos.  I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s better used without the Keratin Smooth Shampoo; maybe finer hair can only stand so much keratin.</li>
    <li> My daughter has naturally thick hair and we go through a lot of conditioner. This one worked fine, really no different than other ones we have used, and conditioned her hair well to allow avoiding tangles (which is often a big challenge for her!) My wife noted &amp;#34;it&#x27;s nice&amp;#34; when I asked for her review of this product as well so I&#x27;ll add that to my title!</li>
    <li> In general, I&#x27;ve been pleased with Tresemme&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners.  This one worked as well as others I have tried.  I have thick, dry, frizzy hair, and this conditioner promises to work in conjunction with flat ironing to keep hair smooth.  What I found was that this worked as well as other anti-frizz shampoos I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s results were not extraordinary, but they were well in line with what I expect from a decent anti-frizz conditioner.  Other than that, this conditioner smells good and smooths on easily.  Decent results, but not earth-shattering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several items from this new Keratin line. And, although the price is super cheap, this may be one of those instances of \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot; I have long wavy hair and occasionally straighten my hair at a salon (via blow-outs). I decided to try this line for fun (and, if it worked, it would save me a small fortune and a ton of time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, I did not notice any smoothing effect (but it is summer and super humid). Likewise, as a conditioner, I would have to say that it did very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not a huge advocate of expensive shampoos and conditioners. I have had as much success with Garnier Fructis products as I have Moroccan products. However, sometimes a person may need to place his/her hair in the hands of a trained professional. As far as color and straightening goes, I&#x27;m leaving that to the pros. (I think this is especially true for those with long hair that they wish to keep healthy).</li>
    <li> I guess it doesn&#x27;t help to have people with allergies in the family.  My daughter, like me, tends to go into sneezing fits with many scented products.  This conditioner did this for her and it does not have a particularly nice smell.  As a conditioner she reports that it did the job, but not particularly well</li>
    <li> when purchasing shampoo I was able to order the Tresemme keratin smooth conditioner as an add on. I was very pleased with that option. This is my usual conditioner.  I love it :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner is helping my hair return to its once glorious self. Changes in my internal balance has left me with much thinner, frizzy hair. This product coats it and leaves it much silkier.</li>
    <li> My daughter hates her curly hair.  I don&#x27;t understand it at all but I keep getting her products to try.&lt;br /&gt; This one worked well. She typically lets her hair dry natural, then uses one of those flat curling irons to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT her hair is straight and shiny and not frizzy which is the point of the product.  think her hair is beautiful no matter what she does to it but she has different standards. The product is more expensive than our usual products.</li>
    <li> We use this conditioner on our four year old daughter&#x27;s tangle-prone hair.  After bathtime, we usually brush it out with a wetbrush, and then gently blow dry it out.  Although as advertised it&#x27;s supposed to work optimally with an iron, the heat from the blow dryer does seem to lock in some of the nutrients and her hair is definitely showing signs of improvement with fewer tangles and split ends between washes.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have loved this product.  I am always so skeptical of new hair products claiming to do this and that, and so did not have high hopes.  However, this product claims to be activated by heat and it is the truth!  After using this product in the shower, and then using a hot blow dryer and then a straightener, my hair felt incredibly smooth and soft.  This is usually not the case and I try to avoid using too much heat.  What is great is that this conditioner claims also to work through three washes and I have had success with that as well.  This allows me to go through the product more slowly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair product junkie and I love to experiment with different hair products, especially the ones that come in a product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a whim since I was getting a little tired of my current hair regiment leaving my hair dry and frizzy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Repair Shampoo (every 2-3 days)&lt;br /&gt;- Argan Magic Conditioner (daily, 20 pumps)&lt;br /&gt;- Garnier Fructis Moroccan Oil Treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be making reviews of each product soon so stay tuned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little about my hair: My hair is very thick Filipino hair that&#x27;s almost down to my belly button. I&#x27;ve never dyed it ever. I put heat to it at most 1-3 days a month. I shower at night and let my hair air dry with the Moroccan oil and then braid it when it&#x27;s dry before I go to sleep. I&#x27;ve been trying to grow it out to my belly button for 5 years without split ends, so I&#x27;m very careful about taking care of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard some good things about keratin treatment for hair, especially for my hair type, but I was hesitant about trying it because I&#x27;ve read some cons about keratin -- too much of it can put &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34; protein in your hair. This can cause some people&#x27;s hair to get really brittle and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other hesitation was from Suave having a keratin shampoo as well. I bought it together with their Argan oil shampoo line, but I had a bad experience with them, so I avoided anything associated with Suave (including keratin) for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m planning on using this as a weekly hair treatment -- every Sunday night so that my hair is fresh and smooth for work on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---- FIRST IMPRESSION (6/17/2014) ----&lt;br /&gt;I started with the Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the conditioner, I had to squeeze out a blob half the size of an egg for my hair. The consistency is not too watery and not too thick, so it&#x27;s a pretty good in-between consistency. I started at my roots and went down. It seemed to go a little thin on my hair and the egg-sized amount probably covered 3/4 of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually take all my hair and twist it a few times and leave it on top of my head. I left it on for a good 5 minutes and rinsed out. I prefer thicker conditioners since I feel they stick better to my hair and don&#x27;t slip around and wash off too easily like thinner conditioners. This conditioner isn&#x27;t so bad. The washing experience was pretty normal. I didn&#x27;t have much to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering, I added Garnier Fructis Argan Oil to my towel damped hair, starting from the tips all the way up to the nape of my neck. (I avoid the bangs and scalp.) I left my hair wrapped up in my towel while my hair was still warm. I left it on for around 5 minutes and then took off the towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its conditioning ability was pretty good. I had very minimal tangles from using a wide tooth comb, so that was a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair dry and braided it so that it doesn&#x27;t break or get tangled at night. I also sleep on satin pillows and sheets to prevent my sheets from pulling out too much moisture from my hair and skin like cotton does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, my hair was very smooth and I&#x27;d say about 90% less frizzy, which is a great improvement! My hair also doesn&#x27;t catch my hand when I run my hands through it. Very happy with that! Do note that my hair for the most part has most of its split ends around 2 inches from the ends, which is where my hair normally gets stuck in knots. While I&#x27;m running my hand through my hair right now, my hand hardly gets caught in tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the straightening cream, but this conditioner paired with the shampoo and the Garnier Fructis Argan Oil, my hair is noticeably smoother and less tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this line again on Sunday, which will be a 4 day gap between use. I will update my review then!little thin on my hair and the egg-sized amount probably covered 3/4 of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually take all my hair and twist it a few times and leave it on top of my head.

    <li> I am so happy to say this product is fantastic. This is so simple to use and doesn&#x27;t require any special tools, skills or talents!&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, colored treated hair that tends to get frizzy in humid weather. I live and work near the ocean so for the past few seasons, I&#x27;ve paid my hairdresser $200 to apply the Coppola keratin treatment to my hair about every 4-5 months. I always dread the appointments because the process takes several hours to complete, followed by 3 days of smelly, greasy hair that I can&#x27;t touch, not even to pull up in a ponytail. I wear a scarf to keep the mess away from my face and then just hide out at home for 3 days! My next appointment is scheduled for the end of March, so this product came for review at the perfect time.&lt;br /&gt;I used this along with the shampoo &amp; leave in conditioner, and simply washed, conditioned, towel dried my hair and styled as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser is going to be disappointed to lose that income!&lt;br /&gt;I hope they keep making this product &amp; I&#x27;ll be stocking up!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Will never change</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I use the whole system together, the shampoo, conditioner &amp; weekly smoother. As a cosmetologist I have used so many different products, pro &amp; non. These have been just fantastic! I would recommend &amp; have recommended to all my friends. Though being an &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; product, I have found it to be better than many pro formulas I can only obtain at professional supply stores...and this system is much cheaper. Okay, time to talk about the amazing details, ladies &amp; gents, the shine it brought to my hair was BRILLIANT! Being in my industry the constant damage to my hair from bleaching, dying, blow drying etc. is hardcore. I haven&#x27;t seen shine like this in my hair in years! Of course the smoothness, no-fly aways, no crazy frizz made this a perfect 10 for me but the shine is what has made me a forever user of this product.&lt;br /&gt;*note (before use of product)- My hair is long, naturally straight with a small wave to it, a little coarse, dry &amp; sometimes brittle. I double process my hair blonde every 6 weeks with bleach(at roots) &amp; permanent dye (overall) &amp; the product has not shown to interfere with my color.</li>
    <li> love it.  i have the easiest time with my hair now.  this product straightens, smooths and shines before using the flat iron.  i have fine, thin hair so it&#x27;s important to mention this.  my hair is easier to manage than some of the reviews i&#x27;ve read.  excellent product!</li>
    <li> This product had a fresh scent and did offer medium conditioning. Had the styling products lived up to their advertising I probably would continue to use these but as it is. I will go back to Sleek Look</li>
    <li> If you have straight fine hair don&#x27;t use this. It is pretty heavy. If you have very thick hair and rough texture it may work great for you. I don&#x27;t know. I won&#x27;t be purchasing it in the future. But again, it could be because my hair texture just doesnt go well with this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this conditioner with the corresponding shampoo and treatment, which might be why I didn&#x27;t see a great effect from the conditioner. My hair is very thick and long and it gets tangled very easily. My hair was a little easier to untangle after I applied this conditioner but not a whole lot. I&#x27;m not even sure if there was a really difference or if I just imagined it because I wanted the product to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product isn&#x27;t bad, but I expected higher quality from Tresemme.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I proudly acknowledge that I haven&#x27;t the foggiest idea as to what is actually *in* this bottle of conditioner, I just know that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it the moment I used it and will be definitely looking into the other items in this line. I&#x27;m assuming that since this is a 7 Day care system that this set is not for prolonged use, but I know I saw some other Keratin Smooth shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> Even though it obviously conditions, it doesnt make my hair heavy or limp, which is a problem I have with most condtioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent conditioner</li>
    <li> I have thick shoulder length hair and this is a phenomenal value which leaves my hair comb-able and shiny.  I used it with the shampoo and was amazed that a product at this price point could deliver such great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used salon products for 30 years including Wen, Big Sexy, Aveda and Pureology.  I change products every couple months because over time my hair gets flat or the conditioner stops working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I find I have to change products again, I will consider the Tresemme line first before going back to salon products.  I&#x27;m delighted that this worked so well for me.  Kept my hair manageable and clean for about 5 days which is longer than most products have done in the past.</li>
    <li> I have one daughter that has course, dry, frizzy hair, so I try just about everything I can get my hands on that claims to work, well. I have purchase a couple of other TRESEMME products, and found they lived up to their claim, so I hoped TRESEMME 7 DAY KERATIN SMOOTH CONDITIONER; 9 OUNCE would do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only one use, I noticed a considerable difference in my daughter’s hair. Wow! Soft, and silky, and the frizz was definitely reduced. I wouldn’t say it lasted seven days, but perhaps over time that might hold true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret, I didn’t purchase the shampoo as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Gorgeous, salon-smooth hair for up to 1 week&lt;br /&gt;•Easily create your style with less frizz and more manageability&lt;br /&gt;•Use with 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo and Heat Activated Treatment&lt;br /&gt;•Gentle enough for everyday use and on color treated hair&lt;br /&gt;•ThermaFlex Technology helps hair resist humidity&lt;br /&gt;•Infused with Keratin for smoothness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its moisture-enhanced formula, TRESemm&amp;eacute; 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner gently conditions women&#x27;s hair to help create smooth, frizz-resistant styles that last for up to 7 days* when used with TRESemm&amp;eacute; 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo and TRESemm&amp;eacute; 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment.

    <li> I had already gotten the Tresemme 7-day heat activated treatment and really liked the result.  On that packaging it recommended that it be used with the 7-day shampoo &amp; conditioner for best results.  Now, I know this is nothing but marketing, but since I did like the results I got with the heat activated treatment I wondered how much more I would like the result if I got the Keratin shampoo and conditioneer and let them all work togther as suggested?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, quite a lot as it turns out.  The conditioner is really emollient and even wet allows a nice slip through with my comb.  For once I did not use the detangler.  My hair did feel smoother and i did notice fewer fly-aways.  While this 7-day system probably won&#x27;t 100% replace my other favorite shampoo/conditioner combos, I liked it enough to include it in my regular product line-up when I routinely rotate out products.</li>
    <li> I have used allot of Tresemme products they are salon quality products at a affordable price. Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner, and Shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable. It does not weight down my hair there is no overwhelming smells. I color and process my hair allot so I need things to condition and strengthening my stressed hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, very course, AA hair.  I use this product with a flat iron as suggested. I use the three step process, shampoo, conditioner and the serum.  Then I use a little hair oil and blow dry my hair.  Then I flat iron it.  It keeps my hair straight and silky for a week or more.  No it does not instanty make your hair straight after you wash and dry it.  You have to use the flat iron, that is how it is activated.  It is always out of stock on the shelves, that should tell you that it works!</li>
    <li> Keratin is the protein that is found in everyone&#x27;s hair and nails and even skin, so adding to your routine should make your hair look better and even become stronger after time. I have thin, fine hair and decided based on the fact that Keratin is supposed to be good for the hair (not only to straighten it as it seems is the way it&#x27;s marketed). My hair seemed to really like the Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner and after a few day&#x27;s use, I think my hair looks a bit fuller and is certainly softer and not so fly-away. The conditioner didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and I had no issues like hair looking greasy sooner than it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner is designed to be used as part of the Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth line, but I didn&#x27;t. I used it along with my normal shampoo and was pleased with the results. My only complaint is the smell is quite strong and perfumy. I would prefer a softer scent myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product to my family and friends? Yes, but not to those that dislike things with strong smells. It is quite overpowering, but does fade after a bit.</li>
