    <li> I love Shea Butter and have used it for years.  This is the first time I have tried the oil form of it but I really like it.</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter. easier to use than the regular shea butter. holds in moisture. I work outside and use this to keep from burning. it has great emollient  properties . I use this also after getting tattoos and they heal incredibly fast.</li>
    <li> I like it , it makes my skin really soft after a ahower. I just wish it had a diffrent lid, for easier pouring.</li>
    <li> Pure Shea Butter Oil is the best out there for dry skin!  I mix this with grape seed oil, jojoba oil, and a little lavender oil.  It&#x27;s the last to go on after a shower.  At 62 I need all the help I can get to keep my skin soft and this helps the best!</li>
    <li> This product has made my skin flawless.</li>
    <li> I have purchased shea butter oil in the past and it had a very distinctive scent.  The oil I received did not smell like shea butter oil normally smells.  To be honest I&#x27;m not quite sure what it is.</li>
    <li> I am using this oil on every part of my body: From hair to toes. I am a fan of Shea Butter Oil from way back. It makes you skin so soft, and beautiful. I have gotten many compliments from my husband about my skin. I recommend this product to all people, young and old. I love how fast it got to me when I ordered. Thank you. I plan on ordering again.</li>
    <li> This oil was different that most of the usual body oils that I purchase. It has a faint sweet scent, and can be used in hair and on skin. A little bit of this somewhat thick oil moisturizes my skin, and gives it a nice sheen. As a hair oil, I need a thicker oil like this to shine my thick, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> This is a silky lotion, quickly absorbed.  You can feel the shea in the oil, but it melts right away.  Silky skin, hair, everything. This stuff is really good. Wish the bottle were bigger, though.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for diabetics with regards to their foot care.  Whether or not you have any open sores it promotes healing and keeps you feet in good condition.</li>
    <li> I also purchased the 32oz. from another company, and their oil is so much richer than this one.  It smells the same but I prefer a richer consistency.  However, it appears to work just as well.  The 32oz. Is the better buy.  Shea butter liquid, however, from whatever company, far exceeds the solid.  You can do so much more with it.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! just a few drops is all you need.</li>
    <li> It is the best oil. I use it with my lotion.  It clears up blemishes slowly and makes skin so soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product but for the price the bottle could&#x27;ve been bigger...it moisturizes very well without a greasy feel</li>
    <li> Horrible smell. I was not willing to see if it work for my skin or not. If you want to try you might have to buy essential oils to keep the smell down.</li>
    <li> Super product, as described, Recommended Seller......A+++++++++++</li>
    <li> This stuff really lasts. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I use it for severe psoriasis. It heels it slowly, but does the job. I like that is doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. This stuff has lasted me for 6 months with daily use. I love that it is organic and no harsh chemicals. I will continue to use this forever. Will never buy any other oils or creams.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea Butter Oil.  It is an awesome product! My daughter came home from college with some and I had to get some too. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> This stuff healed my cracked and bleeding knuckles (cold dry colorado winter air) in just a few days!!!  A little drop or two around hangnail areas takes care of them too!!!  I originally got it to ad to shave soaps/pucks for shaving the face, which it also does very well, but I might not have to endure cracking knuckles all winter along with having a super soft face.  This is good stuff!</li>
    <li> very nice make the body smooth</li>
    <li> just received it today I love it makes my hair so soft makes my skin feel so good and hopefully the grow my hair out</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used Shea butter oil..and I like it. It work very good on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have purchased shea butter oil in the past and it had a very distinctive scent. The oil I got did not smell like shea butter oil, honestly it has terrible small. also the bottle is too small. now I ordered another shea oil and I think I will be luckier.</li>
    <li> Good to place on hair and mix with lotion for dry skin. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> although the picture shows a bottle of clear oil, what was sent to me was a bottle of a milky colored bottle of something. I purchase shea oil all the time and the oil that I buy looks like the one in the picture. Not only the color was a factor, the consistency was an issue as well. The shea oil that I normally buy is light, this oil on the other hand is very thick and greasy. It also look as if whatever was combined in this mixture separated, when first coming out of the bottle it is look like what is on the picture but then this thick creamy looking stuff follows. bottom line, I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very good oil for all body</li>
    <li> This combined with dry-brushing daily keeps my arms smooth and the Keratosis Pilaris away!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I switched from Vitamin E oil to Shea Butter Oil as a facial moisturizer when I learned that Vit E oil can clog your pores, whereas Shea Butter Oil will not (it&#x27;s a zero on the comedogenic scale from 0-5. https://www.beneficialbotanicals.com/facts-figures/comedogenic-rating.html).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight scent that goes away very quickly. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy. I use this in the morning and then put SPF on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value too! I think 4 oz is plenty if you&#x27;re using this for face only.</li>
    <li> Great oil. It really helps with dry skin. Small container though.</li>
