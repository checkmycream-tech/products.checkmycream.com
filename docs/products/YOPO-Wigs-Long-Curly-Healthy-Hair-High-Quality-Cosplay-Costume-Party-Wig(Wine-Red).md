      <li>I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review</li>

      <li>The darker red goes perfect with my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I would order more from this seller.</li>
      <li>I added more tracks to it to give it some volume.  </li>
      <li>Hair is more sleek and curly than pictured (picture shows more wavy/crimpy and voluminous).  </li>
      <li>Parts of the netting and plastic show at the top.</li>

      <li>SUPER CUTE!</li>
      <li>Its pretty good for the price.</li>
      <li>Pretty good for the price.</li>
      <li>It needed a good wash and reset before it was ready to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other than that this is an awesome product and ships quickly! :3</li>
      <li>Even though it looks nothing like the picture to me, I will still make it useful by wearing it with my superwoman costume next year; thats what it fits best for, a costume!</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t skimp on hair on my wig; it&#x27;s really full, almost even too full, in the sense that it&#x27;s a bit heavier than it needs to be even when you go for a nice, voluminous wave.</li>
      <li>Certain parts of the wig cap are kind of patchy</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t come with the wig cap that was supposed to be included for free.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic wig.</li>
      <li>It really is a great wig, it does not feel cheap, you can wash it and dry it just fine.</li>
      <li>The wig material is very soft and light, so it does feel rather nice.  </li>
      <li>and I was so excited when it came.</li>
      <li>True to color, worth the price!</li>
      <li>Quick response and friendly service.</li>
      <li>The only thing is, it&#x27;s not as bright as pictured.</li>
      <li>It looks more real, even, than some of the high-end synthetic wigs I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
      <li>Love this wig it looks so real.</li>
      <li>It came packaged very perfect and delicately.</li>
      <li>Nothing to fancy but looks nice and about as natural as synthetic hair can get.</li>
      <li>It does have a natural scalp piece in the center and a well made cap with clasps for the perfect fit.</li>
      <li>It shipped really quickly</li>
      <li>Speaking of which, the color is very beautiful and has hints of red and purple (I ordered the wine red).</li>
      <li>:) I also love the box that it came in because once I was done wearing it, I straightened it out, and then put it back in the box with the wig over that comes with it inside.</li>
      <li>The hair feels super smooth and almost real!</li>
      <li>This product looks just like the picture and is very pretty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as full as the product photo makes it put to be: I may bulk of up with a strand of extensions if I can find the right color.</li>
      <li>It did ship pretty fast and has a nice texture, but doesn&#x27;t look very close to picture at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it a lot of times, styled it in many different way &amp; its so easy to handle.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the short pros and cons list if you&#x27;re not interested in a longer read: PROS - Soft - Pretty natural looking - Great price - Pretty and true color - Good cap and fitting system - Natural scalp piece</li>
      <li>its soft easy to straighten.. brush.</li>
      <li>Looks exactly like the picture and so soft and doesnt tangle easily.</li>
      <li>All the fiber on my wig was strong and securely rooted, and I didn&#x27;t lose much of it even during the my first time brushing it, so I&#x27;m hopeful that the wig will last me a while.</li>
      <li>The color seemed more brown than red.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It says these wigs are made from heat resistant material, so it is possible to apply even more curls to them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>B. Cut it up and use it to thicken the first one.</li>
      <li>Have not tried to heat style it at all since it looks exactly like pictured, which is what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Personally, I&#x27;m so pleased that on the very same day I got it</li>
      <li>It really was not the right color for her character</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t know much about wigs and want something that you can wear right out of the box, this wig won&#x27;t be for you.  </li>
      <li>Because of this though, I am reducing my original 5 star rating to a 4 because of a clear inconsistency of quality.</li>
      <li>When I ordered the Wine Red wig, I was super excited to get it.</li>
      <li>As promised, the fiber can be heat-styled on low temperatures as if it were real hair without damage, but if you&#x27;re as fond of this wig as I am you&#x27;ll probably want to stay on the safe side and style with steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super soft, fastest shipping out of all the wigs I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon.</li>
      <li>At this price you could easily pick up one in each color and have a terrific wig wardrobe for any costuming event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:</li>
      <li>It really is super soft.</li>
      <li>hair tangled easily and came out in the back</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very nice look forward to using</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price. The color seemed more brown than red. But still is red. It definitely needed fluffing. Not too shiny. Feels soft. Thinner than I would have liked but again good for the price. It didn&#x27;t come with the wig cap that was supposed to be included for free. I emailed seller and they are sending me one. Quick response and friendly service.</li>
    <li> Looks similar to my real hair. Great fullness and high quality.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a GREAT wig. It&#x27;s really good quality, looks just like the picture!</li>
    <li> Super soft, fastest shipping out of all the wigs I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon. True to color, worth the price!</li>
    <li> The only problem is it is a little loose on the scalp, and wants to slide off. Otherwise I love it and would wear it everywhere.</li>
    <li> We bought this wig to braid for an Anna (from Frozen) costume.  It really was not the right color for her character but that was our fault for not paying attention to the name of the color.  Our monitor setting must be off! It is indeed, wine red. Anyway, for the the price, this wig is very nice! And, it was delivered very quickly!</li>
    <li> SUPER CUTE! It feels almost like real hair to me. I haven&#x27;t had any problems whatsoever with mine. Although I ordered wine red, it looks like a deep red-brown. It also looks like a brighter brown in pictures, but that&#x27;d only be a problem for cosplay!</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture and so soft and doesnt tangle easily. I love it and its a great price and came quickly. I would order more from this seller.</li>
    <li> Disappointing! The roots on the wig seem very greasy, almost to the point where I want to add dry shampoo to it.  I can deal with grease but cannot tolerate the smell of mildew when I took it out of the plastic packaging.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this wig! It&#x27;s extremely soft and has a lot of hair. Certain parts of the wig cap are kind of patchy so you can see through it. And the bangs are a mess. If you don&#x27;t know how to cut a wig take it to a salon. Other than that this is an awesome product and ships quickly! :3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m beyond in love with this wig. The color is true to the picture and the quality is great.</li>
    <li> The wig is very small, not nearly as much hair as in the photo. Terrible wig!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t very crimpy xD But good anyway.</li>
    <li> Love this wig it looks so real.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice wig... Long versatile bangs.  It&#x27;s just so thin . I added more tracks to it to give it some volume.  it&#x27;s more for people who a  have small body frame  .. its soft easy to straighten.. brush. Good buy..</li>
    <li> Was not wavy or full, I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s the same wig :(</li>
    <li> nice color and quality</li>
    <li> It came packaged very perfect and delicately. Except the wig isn&#x27;t the color in the photo. It&#x27;s a plum color. Ironic because it&#x27;s the color my natural hair is dyed. The wig cap fits perfectly, especially for people with bigger heads like myself. It&#x27;s soft and the kinks are very pretty. The only fault is the bangs. They&#x27;re hard to manage so it&#x27;ll take some time and bobby pins to adjust them the way you&#x27;d like. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> For the price, this wig is everything!! It really is super soft. The only thing is, it&#x27;s not as bright as pictured. It is a true wine red not bright red. Would totally buy again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! (burgundy, reddish) and its full and fluffy! The bangs fall perfectly on my face, and I&#x27;ve a big head! The texture is pretty sweet too, loose, hippie-looking waves. I definitely recommend this if you also want to have a natural-friendly look as well as cosplay!</li>
    <li> hair tangled easily and came out in the back</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the short pros and cons list if you&#x27;re not interested in a longer read: PROS - Soft - Pretty natural looking - Great price - Pretty and true color - Good cap and fitting system - Natural scalp piece CONS - Fabrication smell - On the thin side (cap may show) - Tangles easily - Not durable enough for lots of brushing - Probably requires extra care for storage to avoid damage and tangles  For the price you pay on this wig ($15), it&#x27;s a great deal. It is very soft and pretty real looking, though it does have that overly shiny look in natural light. It&#x27;s not as full as the product photo makes it put to be: I may bulk of up with a strand of extensions if I can find the right color. Speaking of which, the color is very beautiful and has hints of red and purple (I ordered the wine red). The texture is pretty much exact to the picture and looks very natural. Because the hair is somewhat thin, I did notice that the cap showed at some angles. It&#x27;s just a matter of brushing it to lay so it&#x27;s thick where it needs to be.  It does have a natural scalp piece in the center and a well made cap with clasps for the perfect fit. The only major complaint I have about it is that it&#x27;s delicate; you&#x27;ll want to take it easy on this wig. In the 10 minutes of wearing it inside while barely moving, it did get a few tangles. You&#x27;ll need to run your fingers through it while wearing and I would not recommend any extensive brushing because you&#x27;d probably pull all the hair out and make it all the more thin. Also, it does have a kind of factory smell to it so I&#x27;ll be washing it gently with some wig shampoo before I wear it out. I saved all the packaging and put it back in its bag for storage to preserve it and avoid tangles. After some wear and time has passed I&#x27;ll come back and let you know how it held up!  RETURN REVIEW 4/27/15 I decided to buy another wig to either A. Hope the next one was a bit thicker Or B. Cut it up and use it to thicken the first one. Well, the next wig was a titch thicker, however, the bangs were cut horribly. Seriously, it looks like a 5 year old cut it. I can&#x27;t wear it so I&#x27;m sticking to my plan of cutting it up. Because of this though, I am reducing my original 5 star rating to a 4 because of a clear inconsistency of quality.</li>
    <li> Things You&#x27;ll Like:&lt;br /&gt;The wig is made with a very soft, sturdy, natural-feeling fiber.  The look of the fiber isn&#x27;t %100 realistic, but it&#x27;s about as close to real as you&#x27;re going to get from a burgundy-coloured synthetic fiber.  It looks more real, even, than some of the high-end synthetic wigs I&#x27;ve bought.  They didn&#x27;t skimp on hair on my wig; it&#x27;s really full, almost even too full, in the sense that it&#x27;s a bit heavier than it needs to be even when you go for a nice, voluminous wave. But judging by other reviews, your experience with wig fullness might be a little hit and miss.  All the fiber on my wig was strong and securely rooted, and I didn&#x27;t lose much of it even during the my first time brushing it, so I&#x27;m hopeful that the wig will last me a while. The colour, style, and length is all reasonably close to what you see in the photograph, if you account for variations in monitor calibration.  As promised, the fiber can be heat-styled on low temperatures as if it were real hair without damage, but if you&#x27;re as fond of this wig as I am you&#x27;ll probably want to stay on the safe side and style with steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things You Might Not Like:&lt;br /&gt;The style didn&#x27;t survive shipping.  My wig came out of the box flat in some places, tightly-waved in others, and it didn&#x27;t show nearly the volume it should have for the amount of hair on the wig... it just looked like a bad hairday.  It also had a serious case of post-fab chem smell.  It needed a good wash and reset before it was ready to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview:&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know much about wigs and want something that you can wear right out of the box, this wig won&#x27;t be for you.  It does need a little tlc before you wear it out.  But there&#x27;s plenty of great fiber to work with, so once you&#x27;ve got it washed and reset. it&#x27;s going to be an awesome wig for your money.  Personally, I&#x27;m so pleased that on the very same day I got it, I whipped out my credit caurd and bought myself another wig from the same seller--and Idon&#x27;t even need another.  I just want it really, really bad.</li>
    <li> Its pretty good for the price. Nothing to fancy but looks nice and about as natural as synthetic hair can get. You get what you pay for. Keep it store nicely and brush it out every once in a while.</li>
    <li> the box it came in was very nice and it included a wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;i got this wig for two reasons:the great color and the crimped look. when i got it the color was just as expected, but it was very thin, limp and stringy. this is the wig you would wear if you wanted to look like a cheap hooker!!</li>
    <li> Makes my head look ginormous for some reason. Guess it&#x27;s alright for someone else. Bit thinner than the picture portrays.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic wig. I am so happy with it! It shipped really quickly and I was so excited when it came. The hair feels super smooth and almost real! I wore it out in public and all my friends thought it was my real hair. You can&#x27;t see the under netting unless you purposefully look for it, and it doesn&#x27;t tangle a lot like a lot of other wigs, and when it does tangle you can brush it out with your fingers. I bought the &#x27;Wine Red&#x27; one and it came looking almost exactly like the photo (the hair on the outside was a little less wavy. It probably flattened out in shipping or something.) It does have a little bit of shine but nothing really noticeable. Anyway it&#x27;s a wonderful wig. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this wig.  It shipped fast.  It came looking very close to the photo.  The texture wasn&#x27;t quite as wavy as shown in the photo but since it&#x27;s heat resistant, I was able to add some texture using a small barreled iron on low-med heat.&lt;br /&gt;It curled pretty nicely in this heat setting especially when curling small sections at a time.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs were a little to long, so I trimmed them to what I wanted.  Over all I am happy with this wig!</li>
    <li> Not as poofy the and very shiney.. and mine the hair cut was uneven.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but looks fine</li>
    <li> This product looks just like the picture and is very pretty. I&#x27;ve already gotten compliments on it and it looks like real hair. The darker red goes perfect with my skin tone. I like how it&#x27;s styled so I will not be using heat products on it so I can&#x27;t tell you how well it would hold up. The bangs are perfect length and it is overall a very attractive wig! :) I also love the box that it came in because once I was done wearing it, I straightened it out, and then put it back in the box with the wig over that comes with it inside. :) Perfect!</li>
    <li> When I ordered the Wine Red wig, I was super excited to get it. When I received it, I was disappointed. It looks purple-brown. The color looks nothing like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the wig looks really natural.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the colour, my only complaint is that it frizzes really easily.</li>
    <li> Even though it looks nothing like the picture to me, I will still make it useful by wearing it with my superwoman costume next year; thats what it fits best for, a costume!</li>
    <li> Bangs are not straight across as pictured and thats what I wanted. Overall though it is pretty, just not what I thought I was ordering. They have a side swoop like every other one I found.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Friday it arrived today! (SUNDAY!) It&#x27;s a bit darker but that&#x27;s alright it is very smooth and nicely packaged. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product I combed it put to test how it is with brushes a few strands came out but otherwise no tangles no issues! I will deffinately be buying from this 1seller again! By far the best wigs on amazon</li>
    <li> Honestly one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon. Very soft and natural looking. Texture and fullness shown in photo is not 100% accurate, but the wig is great. :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I was impressed with the quality and look of this wig right out of the box.  Have not tried to heat style it at all since it looks exactly like pictured, which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Very cute/fun.  It&#x27;s not exactly as realistic as it looks in the photo and the color is more purple but I really love it and I put it in pig tails and it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
    <li> Arrived faster than expected.  Bangs needed trimming which was no big deal.  Hair is more sleek and curly than pictured (picture shows more wavy/crimpy and voluminous).  Great color true to photo.  Netting color blends with hair color so cannot see when wearing which is great!</li>
    <li> I was provided a sample product for my unbiased and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls are gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says these wigs are made from heat resistant material, so it is possible to apply even more curls to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality for the price range is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Was okay bangs aren&#x27;t like in the pic but I can work with it! Won&#x27;t be everyday like I planned</li>
    <li> Wig is very thin. Parts of the netting and plastic show at the top. It did ship pretty fast and has a nice texture, but doesn&#x27;t look very close to picture at all. Nowhere near as long or full.</li>
    <li> It really is a great wig, it does not feel cheap, you can wash it and dry it just fine. I&#x27;ve used it a lot of times, styled it in many different way &amp; its so easy to handle. For the price I paid I expected it to be less, but its just what I needed to change up my style &amp; great for costume parties. I am happy with my purchased :D</li>
    <li> I actually like this wig a lot, in spite of the fact that it&#x27;s not terribly natural looking.  The one I received is much smoother than the one pictured, and much glossier as well.  It really does not look particularly natural, but it&#x27;s a fun wig.  The bangs are quite long, almost too long, and the wig itself is a bit snug on my big Charlie Brown head, but with a bit of work it got seated pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the sort of wig you wear to a club, or if you&#x27;re playing the Lady of Shallot in your community theater.  It&#x27;s a total cosplay wig, and a bit long and unnatural looking for everyday.  At least I find it so.  Your mileage may vary.  The wig material is very soft and light, so it does feel rather nice.  At this price you could easily pick up one in each color and have a terrific wig wardrobe for any costuming event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review</li>
