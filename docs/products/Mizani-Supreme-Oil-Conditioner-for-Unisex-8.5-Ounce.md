    <li> bought for my daughter who has had natural hair for the past 6 years and is always looking for the &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;one&amp;#34; conditioner.  This one was not it.  No better results than other ones tried.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this conditioner.  It makes a big difference in the texture of my hair and I will continue using this conditioner as well as the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Anyone who is transitioning from processed (perm) hair back to its natural state knows how dry it becomes. This shampoo (in combination with the shampoo and mask) really kept my hair moisturized during the first 4 months of my transition.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the hype, but is a decent product (if overpriced)</li>
    <li> Mizani Supreme Oil Conditioner 8.5 oz : The smell is pleasant and it is sulfate free. The conditioner is creamy and felt really smooth to the touch. This conditioner not drying like others on the market.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have dry hair and this product makes it feel so smooth, shiny and hidrated. I&#x27;m not using anything else from now on!</li>
    <li> This was great product. My hair was soft and manageable after use. I highly recommend this for those who blow dry and flat iron hair a lot.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner when I first flat iron my hair and again two days prior to washing my hair.  That way my hair is not too heavy all week, but remains moisturized and healthy.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love most of Mizani&#x27;s products. I use the relaxers, serums and conditioners. I was expecting this product to be more mosturizing. It seemed to be a little too light for my hair texture. This product will work well on thin, easily straightened hair. It&#x27;s not for people who are accustomed to the feel of pomades or heavier oils.</li>
    <li> I like this product I&#x27;ve used it once, it was a recommendation from Curly Nikki&#x27;s Blog, Curly Nikki is the author of &amp;#34;Better than Good Hair&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product for my hair! It left my hair soft and very manageable and it had a great smell.</li>

    <li> This product is a nice compliment to the shampoo so glad I found it on Amazon. I would definitely order it again</li>
    <li> Loved this conditioner . Hair felt light and manageable after the first use.</li>
    <li> Decent product, but I could&#x27;ve used Organix and gotten the same results if not better.  This is better than the shampoo.  BEWARE!!!!  Don&#x27;t buy the shampoo (at least not from this seller-  It is not the real thing)!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner for my hair.  It detangles and moisturizes at the same time.  It also has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizng as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I will reorder this when empty, great for a man&#x27;s hari.</li>
    <li> I use the entire product line.. Love it!</li>
