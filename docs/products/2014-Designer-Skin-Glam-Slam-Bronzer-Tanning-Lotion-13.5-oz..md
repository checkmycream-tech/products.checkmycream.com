<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves your skin noticeably darker as well as soft and moisturized after just one use. And I love the fragrance, it reminds me a little of the juicy fruit gum that I chewed as a child. Also the price is much more reasonable here on Amazon versus the salon where I&#x27;ve seen it priced at $50 a bottle.</li>
    <li> Personally, my skin doesn&#x27;t work with this lotion. However, it&#x27;s tanning lotion, it either works for you or it doesn&#x27;t... It definitely worked well on my brother. So I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars cause it worked on him, though I&#x27;ve seen better lotions. I prefer the tingles lotion (Sun Buzz), works like a charm for me in only 3 uses... Anyways, the lotion was 100% legit, I could tell it wasn&#x27;t a knock-off and was not watered down either. Give it a shot (if you can find packets, even better). Happy tanning!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion, it is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> a bit too bronzy for me.</li>
    <li> Works great! And cheaper than buying it in the salons!</li>
    <li> I just tried this lotion for the first time about an hour ago.I got good color from it but the reason I gave it 3 stars is because I don&#x27;t like the smell of it as much as I like some other lotions. Also when putting the lotion on it is a tad Thicker than I like and it dries a little fast so you have to use a little more lotion than normal. it is a good lotion but I prefer designer skin cirque... label me beautiful... or girlfriend sexy by Swedish beauty.</li>
    <li> This one came into my tanning salon and I needed to try it! It smells AMAZING and works wonders. I spent 45 dollars on it at my salon so it&#x27;s kind of hard to believe it is so cheap on here. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this lotion three times now! It&#x27;s my regular lotion. The best deal I&#x27;ve found. I love this brand, I&#x27;ve tried a few others by designer skin. Never disappointed. The scent in this lotion is mild, which is good for me because I have sensitive skin. I have olive complexion and don&#x27;t really tan well. The bronzers in this lotion are perfect and don&#x27;t ever leave streaks. And I lather up pretty thick!</li>
    <li> My tanning salon had this and they sold out of it and never got it back in stock. Low and behold, I checked Amazon and it was available. Definitely worth every penny. Works really well on fair skinned, doesn&#x27;t turn orange, very pleasant smell. Can be used for building a base tan or just maintaining your color.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and leaves your skin soft! It does not seem to have powerful bronzing properties like other lotions.</li>
    <li> No &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; smell! Just fresh and yummy. Great and rapid results. Similar to results of Conceited which I went through a whole bottle of.</li>
    <li> Like this product, especially for the smell....a fruity type smell.  The product is very moisturizing, and creates a nice tan.</li>
    <li> The lady at the tanning salon told me that this product did not do well there with their clientele. They had a lot of complaints about the smell apparently. However, I decided to try it out for myself and I was very pleased with it. It smells fruity, more so like watermelon than anything. It gives you great color. It also does not have the after tan odor. I love this product because I go to school then work every day. I get a little time in between to go tanning and I don&#x27;t have to worry about offending anyone with the after tan odor. I am also Irish so I don&#x27;t get very much color but Glam Slam got me tan!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion from my local tanning salon because it was recommended for my lighter skin.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t get as dark as I would like, but overall not a terrible product. There are other options from this company that I think would be better for pretty much anyone. A good starter lotion, but that&#x27;s about it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant fruity scent (not too heavy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t tan quickly enough</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful but did not break my plateau phase like I had hoped it would. Also, I dont think there was much bronzer at all.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a very fruity scent, smells good even after tanning! I see results with it&#x27;s delayed bronzers hours after tanning. my skin feels great not dry or greasy, I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
    <li> Okay ladies (and guys if you&#x27;re wanting to smell like a fruit salad) this tanning lotion is AWESOME!  I literally just used it when I went to tan.  It has a silky texture, rubs in nicely and dries fast and you smell AMAZING after putting it on.  Literally like a fruity yummy salad!  I will never use anything else ever again. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Designer Skin. Buy this!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that everyone is different, and certain products may work for others while some may not. I purchased this lotion based on reviews of seeing results quickly. Unfortunately, I did not see those kinds of results. On the bright side, the shipping was VERY fast. It came to my door 4 days ahead of the original schedule! It was sealed in plastic, and the consistency is right. The smell is fruity and delicious. It goes on smooth. I gave it a few days before writing a review. It just did not give me as much as I had hoped. I will use it again and see if it gives me more color and if it does I will update my review. It is an indoor/outdoor lotion, so I may try it in the sun. If not, I can use it to switch with my other lotions when I feel I am getting too dark but still want to tan. Imo, it may work for someone who is just starting off tanning, but not for someone who already has good color.</li>
    <li> I switch between this lotion and another.  Smell is great and it helped my skin get darker quick.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is a good price for this lotion. You cant buy this at the tanning salon for a price any less than $80</li>
    <li> It feels and smells great</li>
    <li> I want to give this 0 stars! After being warned of the dangerous chemicals people cut these discounted tanning lotions with I started seeing the warning signs in this lotion. 1. When I very first opened it the watermelon smell was so strong it filled the room. Now you can barely smell it. This tells me they added extra watermelon to cover up whatever horrible things they put in it. 2. I have gotten a terrible leg rash that gets worse the more I use this. 3. After tanning I smell like burnt wet hair. It is literally burning up my skin. I want my money refunded for the fact that this product is hazardous! BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion, I am pretty fair skinned and usually burn before tanning, but with this lotion I have a pretty good tan after only a couple sessions. And it smells really good!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy. A little will go along way.  I would defiantly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and Im not one to go off of smell because you smell like you worked out for 3 hrs everytime you hop out of the bed anyways but with this you dont. My mind has been blown. I even use it after I take a shower to help build up the DHA</li>
    <li> Great product, smells amazing even after tanning. Not greasy. A little goes a long way for application. Oder was straight forward, came as predicted no issues what so ever.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and very fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan easily and had good results with this lotion. It took about 2 weeks of using this daily for 15-20mins per day to achieve my desired results. Doesn&#x27;t make you orange and goes on smooth and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of Designer Skin, nothing I&#x27;ve tried compares.  They excel where my poor white skin cannot!  I have used Luminary, Black Tan Extender, Luminary for face, Tiny Bubbles, and now Glam Slam.  Not only does it work fantastic, but the SMELL IS HEAVENLY!  This is the first tanning lotion with DHA that I have EVER used that had no ATO!!!  You smell like kiwi, melon, and banana!  It is delicious!!!  I could literally eat my arm when I put in on, lol.  I must say, the best ATO inhibitor I have experienced yet, and if you are like me and run from the tanning bed to work or school, you will thank yourself for this purchase!  I paid $66 at the salon!  I also love Adore, the only tanning lotion without DHA that I have used that has actually shown color on me after 1 visit in the tanning bed!  Tiny Bubbles...you won&#x27;t want to get out of the bath!  It also smells amazing! I was skeptical about effectiveness, but I have extremely dry skin, and this stuff leaves me more moisturized after a shower than anything else I&#x27;ve used, and you skin seems to glow from the Opti-Glow complex.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does!  I buy only Designer Skin, regardless of whether you want a bronzer, no bronzer, DHA and Erythrulose, or neither,black walnut seed extract, ATO inhibitors, etc....you cannot enjoy a product more than their silicone emulsions.  If you are a hot-natured person who sweats like I do, summer or not, you want this kind of blend!  It goes on like silk and disappears into your skin, no stickiness, no afterfeel, no odor.  This is the only line I will buy!</li>
    <li> I so love this tanning lotion it is awesome ! so I am tanning a lot know and trying different lotions ..I really like glam it smells good and feels great</li>
    <li> It smells yummy, like Now and Laters.  It gives good color, but if you are trying to get really dark fast this might not be the one for you.  I like it because it is a low maintenance on the hassle and doesn&#x27;t have that annoying after smell</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and no ato at all. Its a medium brown color. Not thick but not watery. Non greasy. Love this lotion.</li>
    <li> I am a tried and true Glam Slam user. I typically only tan for a month a year but have remained loyal to this line. This lotion makes my skin so so soft! It smells fruity when applying it to the skin however, when I retreat from the UVA/B tunnel I always smell like chili cheese Fritos. I haven&#x27;t used anything that didn&#x27;t make me smell odd when tanning indoors. In addition to it&#x27;s softening powers, this lotion also plumps my skin and facilitates a healthy complexion. I tan approximately 5 times a week and I still have about 1/3 of the bottle left after a month. I highly recommend this lotion for those worried about dry skin when tanning indoors and those that hope to prevent premature aging.</li>
    <li> Good product overall for the causal tanner. Nice scent, not sticky</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and makes my skin soft as well as bronze as hell. :) I dig it.</li>
    <li> The smell of this stuff is awesome! It has a kinda fruity scent but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. I was pale as could be when i started using it and after 3 sessions I was noticeably darker.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  You get dark quickly and there really isn&#x27;t much of a smell.  Definitely amped up my color after tanning for the past 3 years.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It makes my skin super soft but I did have an allergic reaction to it. After using 3 times I broke out in tiny blisters all over my stomach and chest. I wish I could continue using this product. Only hypoallergenic lotions for me from now on.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST indoor tanning lotion out there. It smells wonderful even after tanning. It is not sticky or thick. Definitely worth the cost. I am on my third bottle.</li>
    <li> Not great smelling- very light bronzer</li>
    <li> I use this lotion every time I want to look bronzed, like before a night out. This gives great and quick results and smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product wife loves it.</li>
    <li> The scent is great but it doesn&#x27;t have the thick consistency I am used to with tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> Scent--Don&#x27;t care much for the scent, it&#x27;s a little too fruity for me. On a positive note, it doesn&#x27;t smell disgusting after you tan.&lt;br /&gt;Results--I&#x27;m not a fan of this lotion, I didn&#x27;t notice any results afterwards. It would probably work better for someone who is fair skinned, or doesn&#x27;t want a ton of color.</li>
    <li> SUper fast ship! Smells amazing and makes my skin feel super soft! Absolutely love designer skin tanning products, will definetaly purchase again!</li>
    <li> GREAT smell...no after tan burn smell. Bronzers work within 30 minutes. I have been tanning for almost 2 years and have tries EVERY lotion imaginable (except for the tingle or sizzle or heat). This is DEFINITELY one of my faves! My top fave right now is J Woww Natural Black Bronzer. I will use BOTH frequently. You won&#x27;t be disappointed by this lotion.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t  as fond of my coloring with this product. Ive had better bronzer  lotions. It does smell  wonderful though and skin feels good.</li>
    <li> Nice Product, Gives a great tan:</li>
    <li> Smells great. Great bronzer.  Bought this a few times. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned and was already tanning for a few months when i purchased this lotion. After just TWO days of using this dual-bronzer lotion their was a huge difference!!  With the Immediate bronzing effects that wont rub off on clothes plus the color that develops over time after UV exposure, this product has been great both in indoor and outdoor tanning! The smell is fantastic! Very fruity and sweet.</li>
    <li> Not too fragrant and was smooth going on. I still had that after tan smell, trying to find another lotion.</li>
    <li> I tried a packet of this stuff about 3 weeks ago at the tanning salon I go to. The girls that work there swear by this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing. Makes me want kiwis and watermelon all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on nice and smooth, a little goes a long way which I love.&lt;br /&gt;After a few sessions and packets I noticed a huge difference in my skin color and feel.&lt;br /&gt;Def. firms my skin, major plus.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good!</li>
    <li> First time to use this lotion, smells good, nice bronzing will definitely  buy again, great price too.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome, smells wonderful! Plus I notice a difference in color after I tan. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. I had already acquired a good base tan, but I was at a plateau. The Glam Slam got me through that and I tanned darker the first time I used it. It goes on nice too. I would have given it a 5 star, but the smell is not to my preference; it&#x27;s kind of fruity and I prefer a more coconutty scent. I will still use this until it&#x27;s gone, because most importantly...it does what it promises. No problems with seller.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy what a waste of $</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected.  Little color is gained using this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  It smells wonderful and its a subtle bronzer so it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks like some other brands.  I got great color after just a few uses with this-and I am normally very light skinned.  I would recommend this 100 times over.</li>
    <li> works great, smells good, and ten times cheaper then it was in the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth great color and has. good smell not overpowering..would definitely recommend to others and will purchase again for  me.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion and the fruity smell! Does leave a slight burnt smell afterward.</li>
    <li> I REALLY disliked the smell. To me, &amp; maybe it&#x27;s just me but it had a slight vomit smell. I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with the tan I got either. I&#x27;ll use the bottle up just to use it up unless someone actually tells me I smell like barf...then I&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s not just me lol.</li>
    <li> its was great as a starter i still use it on my face now i use ruby because of the an i got alot darker i still use this glam slam on my face</li>
    <li> Damaged bottle leaking,  not full. I bought samr lotion from the tanning salon. This is darker, watery and greasy with a weird smell.  Not authentic.  They said they would immediately refund me now they are saying I must return item first. Projects a joke c as well as their word</li>
