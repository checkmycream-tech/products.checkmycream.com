<li> Doesn&#x27;t last when applied very long.</li>
<li> Shades of pink, green, blue, yellow.</li>
<li> I expected it in a week.</li>
<li> The only problem I have with it is that I have a medium olive ton skin and even after using primer and NYX milk as a base I still didn&#x27;t have the color pay off that many others said that they did.</li>
<li> I recommend wearing a white base underneath (like nyx milk) to make the color pop even more...</li>
<li> Can be paired with other neutrals.</li>
<li> Small amount of product for each color but total amount and quality equals if not a bargain for the price point.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to order the other Go Palettes!</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing the bigger palets because i would never used half the colors, so i decided to try these.</li>
<li> it might be small</li>
<li> Palette really small.</li>
<li> I ended up wearing subtle gold shades with glimmer in my brow and used these colors as eye liners to match my outfits...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve even tried skipping base, then skipping primer with the same results.</li>
<li> however it arrived and almost every color was broken.</li>
<li> One of my pans had broken shadow but 50% of it still remains.  </li>

    <li> I bought this palette to use at my colorful indian wedding, but the colors were too intense when I applied to the whole brow. I ended up wearing subtle gold shades with glimmer in my brow and used these colors as eye liners to match my outfits... that worked beautifully.</li>
    <li> Always been a fan of coastal scent products!  One of my pans had broken shadow but 50% of it still remains.  I would still re order in the future!</li>
    <li> I received this palette in 3 days! That&#x27;s awesome cause I expected it in a week. The colors are all there, intact, and so vivid! The mirror is pretty big considering the size (which fits almost in my palm). The colors go on smooth and last pretty long but I always recommend a primer. There is very little fallout and the price is decent for decent quality! great buy</li>

Small amount of product for each color but total amount and quality equals if not a bargain for the price point. I was also going to get the Beijing set but then realized it&#x27;s more expensive on Amazon so I&#x27;m going to buy it directly off of Coastal Scents website.</li>
    <li> Colors are very beautiful and go well together to create a custom look. They all are pigmented - even the lighter colors! I would repurchase and recommend!</li>

    <li> I love this little palette! I ordered it yesterday and it arrived this morning. The colors are beautiful and apply very nicely.
