<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;1st time I purchased it was a lower price...&lt;br /&gt;but still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected but good product.</li>
    <li> Make up everywhere... broke!!!!!  Don&#x27;t order</li>
    <li> Great little kit for the price. Comes with a lot of colors and is a good started kit for teenagers. I ordered two as gifts and both of them came totally intact. None of the powders were broken.</li>
    <li> The product looked nothing like the picture and received late.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter thinking it would be a cheap makeup set.. in price yes but the quality isn&#x27;t actually bad. Pleasantly surprised and the colors are nice and bright.</li>
    <li> This is top of the line make up kit. its like something out of a run way. This fits in your purse perfectly, has great colors and great make up. Its not the cheap kind that wears off easily. It stays on your face like it should Awsome product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my teenage cousin who loves makeup. It was cheap and came with a lot. Made a great gift. Was nice and compact, too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cute eye makeup kit for my niece and I think she will enjoy them. It is a great size and can fit in her purse. I recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the money</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is terrible. It is all broken up after a few uses. The colors are not bright and you have to really put a lot on. The blush is ok, so I gave it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> box full of poweder dont buy</li>
    <li> I never used this eyeshadow kit before I sent it back. It was going to be a gift for my teenage niece. Once I received the product I opened it to see the quality. It looked like the kind of make up you get at Christmas time in those huge kits that cost $5. The colors were outdated and looked cheap. Like I said though, I did not use them so I can only comment on what it appeared to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When returning the product to Amazon I was very pleased. They took it back no problem and refunded my money very quickly. Amazon is always so great.</li>
    <li> The kit I received looked nothing like the picture. I&#x27;m really disappointed and will not be purchasing from them again</li>
    <li> Compact great to travel with- nice colors and doesn&#x27;t have anything that you wouldn&#x27;t use! A great buy for price! Great gifts for stocking stuffer this year!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to my wife, and she liked it.  We would recommend this product to anyone, correct price and quality.</li>
    <li> Came in good condition. Compact size,would make a great gift...</li>
    <li> My daughter loved how compact this was. She was looking for something small to put in her backpack, and this was perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this for one of my nieces as part of her Christmas gifts and she loved it. I&#x27;m not sure about the staying power of the makeup but as long as she is happy with it, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old daughter got this with an Amazon gift card.  The make up is fine, but one of the eye make up applicators got stuck under the middle compartment.  Frustrating - you can hear the applicator shaking around, but there is no way to remove it without breaking the make up kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my niece.  It had so much potential but unfortunately anything that was powdered makeup was a crumbly, dusty mess when I opened the box. Essentially, it was unusable, the powered portion of the makeup was caked onto everything  else.  If it had been shipped more carefully this would have been perfect.  Bummed, I don&#x27;t do in store shopping anymore and now I have no choice!</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly (within a week from when I placed the order)and it was completely intact, none of the shadows or blushes were cracked or anything. The blushes are perfect and the shadows are really cute colors. The only complaint I have is that the colors I got don&#x27;t match the colors in the picture, but I still like them. Overall a great little kit for your purse, it&#x27;s about the size of a pack of 100&#x27;s cigarettes. I will definitely buy from this seller again :)</li>
    <li> these are super sets and the makeup is nice ... got the girls ( teens) all one for a stocking stuffer . and i had no complaints and requests for another for the holidays this year . small but there is quite a bit to like though</li>
    <li> Looks bigger online than it really is.  Fits in the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice collection of make up types and colors in a relatively compact container. There aren&#x27;t as many more neutral eyeshadow colors as I might use, but there are lots of colors to choose from. The blush brush and lip brush are a bit small and the eyeshadow applicator is rather stiff, but the whole thing is useable.</li>
    <li> i got one for my brother in law&#x60;s girlfriend one and she love&#x60;s it she use&#x60;s it all the time when they go some where nice</li>
    <li> Good size for the young teen just starting out with makeup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good makeup if you were intending to give it to a child. The lip stains sort of remind me of fake make-up my Mum used to buy me when I was young and the mirror clouds easily.</li>
    <li> I really like this set. It&#x27;s small and convenient -- perfect for throwing in your bag to just go without worrying, whether that&#x27;s your daily bag or for a carry on on a plane. It has pretty much everything you need. I was even able to improvise some eyeliner with this kit; just use the included small, stiff brush to dip into the color of your choice (i recommend either the black or navy blue eye shadow) and use it like an eyeliner pencil. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This has it all, for travel, overnight, and compact makeup for on the go. If it can work for me it will work for you, as I am picky about what goes on my face. You might bring along your favorite lipstick as we all have our favorite!</li>
    <li> came broken, when I tried to resolve the issue it didn&#x27;t go higher than the ceiling. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m disappointed because I didn&#x27;t have a chance to try the product based off the fact that it came in pieces. Too bad because I actually love the other Shany cosmetics products that I purchased.</li>
    <li> What I thought It was not that. Its too small like its not for a girl but for a doll. This should be 2 or 3 dollars I guess.  Regret to buy</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the selection of eye shadow and blush in this makeup kit.  I got it for one of my granddaughters who just started wearing makeup, so she was able to experiment without having to buy each color individually.</li>
    <li> Some of the colors were a tad over the top. The bright blue was a little much but its nice other then that. The side parts were hard to pull out. But I will be using frequently!</li>
    <li> I brought this for my coworker as a birthday gift. She loves make up and its small enoigh to walk around in her purse. Shipping was good fast and easy. My only problem was when i open the package the sufuce was scratch, like if someone had it but never used it. Tge makeup was good and unused. My coworker loved it and didnt mind tge scratch but i did, thats why i gived it three stars</li>
    <li> Very nice, bought as a gift for family member.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 10 year old and she absolutely loves it. It has just the right amount of make up in this kit. Fun colors and a good size mirror in the kit. Shipped fast too and was very satisfied with the condition of the product. I thought we may have had some cracked eyeshadows from bumping around in the package but all was perfect when we checked it out.</li>
    <li> Got this today, but it is another brand besides what this company is calling it, very dissapointed that is not an actual Shany product.</li>
    <li> teenage girls and makeup, they spent hours trying out all the new colors, and they can match any outfit, great gift</li>
    <li> This product was a gift for a young lady. She loves it. It is compact enough to fit in her very crowded backpack.</li>
    <li> My friends grand daughter loved this. I thought it would be a great purse item. Its has a little of all the quick items a young girl needs to freshen up</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, some stuff that was shown in the pictures were not in the kit, so 3 stars.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. She is always on the go with the twins mentioned in my earlier post. Happy that she can put in her bag and have all she needs in one palette.</li>
    <li> This would be ideal for a young girl just starting to wear makeup - pretty colors and all in one container!  Doesn&#x27;t last a long time once applied but for a young girl that would be perfect!</li>
    <li> Nice compact...perfect size for travel...had all the colors my daughter generally uses and they are very vibrant when applied...actually the quality seems to be better than some of the more expensive brands.  I am 100% pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this to experiment with some different looks and thought a variety pack was the way to go.  Well unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t care for the shades at all.  The makeup quality itself was quite cheap and I&#x27;d give it away but I doubt anyone I know would want it.  If you have a little girl that wants to play dress up, go for this.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d keep shopping.</li>
    <li> Adorable mini makeup set my neice loved this</li>
    <li> Not bad for a travel set as it contains everything except eye liner and mascara.  The shadow colors were a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> the young lady i gave this too for Christmas loves it she raves about it. he favorite feature is how it folds together,</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite travel makeup. Everything but moisturizer included. Great range of eye colors for day or evening wear.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and easy to use.  This was a gift for my teenage grand daughter and she loved it.  The colors were soft and blend nicely.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Nice inexpensive toy for young girls who want to play adults. My 8 years old asked &amp;#34;Santa&amp;#34; to bring her a makup and I found this to be a good tradeoff for getting her what she asked for and not spending a lot.</li>
    <li> Very cute, compact make up set. The eyeshadows and lip glosses have a nice shimmer to them. Bought for my daughter, so she wouldn&#x27;t have to play dress up with mine anymore ha ha, but nice quality, so might be ordering one for myself to keep in my purse. Came quick; very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I chose this item for my daughter, but disappointed by how small it was; however, my daughter liked the compact size.  Great size for her purse/backpack.  Great stocking stuffer gift.</li>
    <li> Colors not very vivid and I think I might be allergic to something in this brand. Sting&#x27;s my eyes.</li>
    <li> everything she wanted :) well placed, compact for a small dresser, and love the neutralness of the colors. great job</li>
    <li> I really like it....I expect it to be a little bit bigger than the picture,  but it&#x27;s ok and the colors are pretty cool.</li>
    <li> It was great untll the powder cake crumbled literally into powder and got in my eye shadow and lip gloss and now whenever I open it powder goes everywhere</li>
    <li> This was a Xmas present for my niece and she loved it. Well packaged and delivered on time. This is not the picture of the makeup kit I bought thou (???)</li>
    <li> came broken, not worth it.</li>
    <li> The draws where not easy to open. All of the powder spilled.</li>
    <li> I ordered three of these. Two were fine, the other was all busted up. I realize this sometimes happens in shipping, but was disappointed as these were to be part of a gift set for bridesmaids. :(</li>
    <li> compact and good in a pinch</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good quality makeup set. Bought it as a stocking stuffer and my daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> So the first thing I noticed was that the package did not say shany on it, it says beauty revolution. The colors do not match the picture but i like the colors that were in it much beteer than the picture above. Nice and compact.</li>
    <li> So compact great for anyone on the go but got this for my teenage girls easy everything they needed will buy more for their friends as Christmas, birthday, or special occasions.</li>
    <li> My daughters  liked it...much smaller then I thought  it  would  be  though.</li>
    <li> My Daughter loves this.</li>
    <li> My girls loved this christmas gift. They&#x27;ve used it many times already. They are 7 &amp; 8 years old.Thank you.</li>
    <li> A bit small for the money</li>
    <li> I bought this because i feel my mother is always busy,  so it being travel sized was what appealed to me. Also she needed more make up and i thought this would be a sophisticated and sturdy tool. But when i got it just opening it i almost broke one of the slides and even now it still wont close. The eyeshadows were pigmented but i felt the plastic that held everything together was cheap and would break very easily. I bought her a different palette by sonia Kashuk that she loved and i thought about giving it as a gift to my cousin who is 16.. but the colors are too mature. So i really can&#x27;t do anything with it.. I believe it can work out as gifts for some people but in my case it just wasn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 13 yr old niece. Very happy with it other than it&#x27;s smaller than I thought it would be. Still holds quite a bit. Overall good buy</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and we were both very happy with it.  It is really compact and has everything in it!  I&#x27;ve asked my daughter not to use some of the colors... but it has a good selection of lighter and neutral options too.</li>
    <li> My Wife love it so much that he order more Make up Kit , but she would have like more if the Eye shadow make up kit was little bigger in size</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present.. It went over well.. She loved it. Im sure she has gotten alot of use out of it!</li>
    <li> THis is perfect for a quick grab-and-go travel kit for any trip. It has all the colors you&#x27;d need and it&#x27;s nice and compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in your bag.</li>
    <li> This was what I was looking for. My daughter wanted a makeup set that was compact. This is it and it was a low price.</li>
    <li> I gave it to a young lady for her 15th. birthday. She LOVED it.</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s of bang for your buck!~ Got this for my teenage daughter who likes the compact size for bringing everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift for my grandaughter&#x27;s.  With so many colors to choose from they can try all of them and choose which ones look the best.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I realized but cute and does the trick.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I actually expected....its an ok product.I actually thought it was a cream makeup..but it works perfectly though</li>
    <li> Bought two and I was not impressed.  They where  small and cheap quality. I know it was suppose to be travel sized but seriously do not buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute.  I bought it for my friend&#x27;s birthday.  I hope she likes it.  It&#x27;s cute and has a wide variety for a little pack.</li>
    <li> very small not what I expecting  lot smaller.</li>
    <li> I needed something for my granddaughter so she can play dress up. This was the perfect size, the best price and delivery is always ontime. I have purchased from this company before and have always been satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great travel size kit. Some of the colors are a little darker than I would have thought, but it works out well with the smokey eye look. Lipstick holds up fairly well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas present for my daughter. She liked it bit I was disappointed 2 of the powders were broken in spilt..</li>
    <li> I bought it for my 5 year old who wanted make-up to play with. It was a cheap option that had better quality and selection of colors than the cheapo kids things you can buy. She uses it for play and she loves it. It was a lot smaller than I expected and the case is pretty flimsy and the tiny lip brush gets stuck/lost on the inside frequently, and the rounded end of the case came off right at the start. Not enough bad to return it, it&#x27;s good enough for a 5 year old to play with and the colors are nice.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for someone , kit is not the one that is pictured , still a nice little kit though</li>
    <li> Looks NOTHING like the picture. I did not get the items promoted in this picture. Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> I brought this as a Christmas gift for her, and she uses it everyday as a simple carry along in her purse. Very nice colors as well as applicators available. Very nice product!</li>
    <li> Very good quality product, i purchased this item as a gift &amp; the person who received it was very happy, thank you.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and she loved it. Colors were perfect for her olive skin tones. Packaged well and none of it was broken. Easy to open/close the case.</li>
    <li> It looked bigger in the picture to me.  I bought it as a gift for my daughter to play with. It was really just a stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> The travail size eyeshadow  have be received excellent without damage.The colors is enough for me.The box is refined .I like it .</li>
    <li> A gift for my girlfriend for Christmas. Arrived right on time and in great condition. She uses it as a travel makeup kit and she uses it everyday!</li>
    <li> I got this to carry on my purse for touch ups and that is about it. The colors are much bright than they look in the picture provided but not terrible. I am also black so I can&#x27;t wear just any color but these work great with my skin tone, all of the colors blush and the lips colors the powder I am not sure about yet it is shimmer FYI. It has bit of a drug store feel but for the price I am not complaining. I am pleased with the product over all.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my six year old daughter who loves make-up. She LOVES it. It is very small, which is perfect for her to stick in a purse or backpack. The make-up is not professional, but definitely better than &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; make-up, which doesn&#x27;t show up or last long. She&#x27;s serious about her make-up and this kit makes her feel more grown up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this product for an adult, as the kit is very small and the make-up is very basic. But for teens and children, it&#x27;s a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> Actually really good!</li>
    <li> wery cute and convenient but the quality of the actual make up is horrible.  It feels like childs paint from the dollar store.  Great concept but no cigar on this one.</li>
    <li> Unlike the cheap versions of these, this makeup kit does not fall apart or break when you slide open the sides.  This compact kit is great to toss in your purse and have your compact mirror with all your touching-up makeup needs.  I bought this for my niece who is in high school as a gift and she loves it.  BR cosmetics is fine quality makeup so this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 5 year old daughter to use for play make-up. It is the perfect size for her. It came with all the brushes and has make-up for all areas of the face. It does not turn her sensitive skin red when we wash it off, which was a huge bonus for me. She has had it for six months and still has about 25% of the make-up left. She loves that it looks like grown-up make-up and has a mirror and that it fits in her small purse. It does not have the colors that I would use, but I love it for play.</li>
    <li> i got something different then what was in the picture and very unhappy</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I needed some bold colors but didn&#x27;t want some gigantic palette on my dresser. I looked at some of the reviews after I purchased the product and wasn&#x27;t sure I made the right choice by purchasing the product. I received the product today and I have to say that this product is not so horrifying as some of the reviews made it seem. The colors are not so child-like. There are some shimmers and mattes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, for some reason after I purchased the round palette picture, on my shipment confirmation, there is another square palette picture so I was under the assumption that I was going to get the wrong product so obviously I was worried that I wasted my money. By luckily it was the correct product. Nothing was broken and everything was in tact in the packaging. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the packaging of the product is a little weak. Real cheap material for a travel size product. But for about $10, its expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make up itself is decent for someone looking for a change in palette.</li>
    <li> I am really glad I ordered this.  The case works well for when I travel and the colors actually stay on.</li>
    <li> a lot smaller that it shows in the picture.</li>
    <li> I travel for my job.  I decided to purchase your makeup case for my suitcase.  This a great addition to my check list.  Quality</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT. WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> To be clear, I didn&#x27;t buy this for myself. I bought it for a 9-year-old girl who likes to play dress up and put play make up on. I don&#x27;t think any adult woman should buy this. It&#x27;s cheap and stupid, but for my niece it was perfect! I knew she&#x27;d think all the compartments were really cool and it&#x27;s just fun to open and close!</li>
    <li> Good quality makeup, better than described...easily fits in a clutch. and has everything you need for a quick fix up on the go.</li>
    <li> perfect size for travel so I don&#x27;t have to pack a large make-up bag.</li>
