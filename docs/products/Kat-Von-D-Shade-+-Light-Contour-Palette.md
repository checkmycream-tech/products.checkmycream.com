      <li>Blends amazingly!</li>
      <li>The color on this palette are amazing!</li>
      <li>light contouring kit is the best I have tried.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved that it came with instructions on where to highlight and shade.</li>
      <li>I love the highlighting colors!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
      <li>Amazing product, so much better than ABH!</li>
      <li>It came in handy while I was teaching myself to contour.</li>
      <li>Best product by far I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>i love it it blends so well</li>
      <li>in love</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>, you are getting more color for your money with Kat Von D</li>
      <li>There is a cool tone, neutral tone, and warm tone for each of the darker and lighter shades.</li>
      <li>blends much more smoothly and easily than the ANASTASIA  kit did on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth the price! :)</li>
      <li>easily won!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it and they also included a eyeliner/lip liner in a color i was actually looking for so that was great</li>
      <li>Amazing products, love them &amp; very pigmented..  </li>
      <li>It applies easily and blends nicely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>skin tone is on the lighter side of medium, my sisters easily falls into the light category.</li>
      <li>The application is smooth.</li>
      <li>It is super great for setting under eye concealer, the light yellow shade on top really helps counteract dark circles, and the darker contour shades on the bottom work great.</li>
      <li>The top middle highlight shade is my favorite</li>
      <li>colors apply very smoothly, when applying you will get that nice dark streak.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>And I love that it has a bronzing color too, which I find myself using more than my other bronzers.</li>
      <li>My only drawback is that I love this product so much I&#x27;ve torn through it in under two months!!</li>
      <li>Just bought this palette along with her new light eye palette, couldn&#x27;t resist had to buy both.</li>
      <li>The stuff at Walmart is just as good for less than $10..</li>
      <li>Will most likely purchase again and try to extend the life of my favorite highlight next time.</li>
      <li>I was torn between this Kat Von D kit and one by ANASTASIA, (which is currently one of the top recommended for novices and pros)  </li>
      <li>In the video, Kat applies this to three different women, but I felt like none of the highlighting shades were bright enough for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>This was my first contour kit, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
      <li>Very timely and well wrapped.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, but is pricey.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m normally a MAC person.</li>
      <li>As someone who is constantly buying higher end makeup</li>
      <li>After using this a couple of months contouring has become one of the steps that I do in my makeup routine, and now it&#x27;s as natural as applying mascara.</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve been better off spending less and buying two single pots of another product.</li>
      <li>your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a highlight guide, however if you are new to contouring I would recommend checking out a Youtube tutorial for proper application and blending techniques.</li>
      <li>also invest in a decent set of brushes for application.&lt;br /&gt;It would seem like the price would be the only downside, however since you are getting almost double the color of other kits, I can&#x27;t call it a downside.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just bought this palette along with her new light eye palette, couldn&#x27;t resist had to buy both. Amazing products, love them &amp; very pigmented..  Definitely recommend, you get alot of product for your $.</li>
    <li> In love with this product!!! The powders sit so well on my face and make it look so flawless. Will definently buy over and over again!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, so much better than ABH!</li>
    <li> I wanted to dip my toes into contouring, so I did a lot of research.  I was torn between this Kat Von D kit and one by ANASTASIA, (which is currently one of the top recommended for novices and pros)  I went to a Sephora store to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;I like most beginning this journey was afraid of making myself look like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;The Kat Von D easily won!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is on the lighter side of medium, my sisters easily falls into the light category. The palette works for both of us. It also works well for darker skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the price difference frighten you, you are getting more color for your money with Kat Von D&lt;br /&gt;The colors apply very smoothly, when applying you will get that nice dark streak.&lt;br /&gt;This blends much more smoothly and easily than the ANASTASIA  kit did on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;a Few hints, this is a product you will want to apply after your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a highlight guide, however if you are new to contouring I would recommend checking out a Youtube tutorial for proper application and blending techniques. also invest in a decent set of brushes for application.&lt;br /&gt;It would seem like the price would be the only downside, however since you are getting almost double the color of other kits, I can&#x27;t call it a downside.&lt;br /&gt;Give this a chance, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> The stuff at Walmart is just as good for less than $10..</li>
    <li> Love it and they also included a eyeliner/lip liner in a color i was actually looking for so that was great</li>
    <li> I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I love the highlighting colors! They are great under the eyes and so pigmented! And I love that it has a bronzing color too, which I find myself using more than my other bronzers.</li>

It is super great for setting under eye concealer, the light yellow shade on top really helps counteract dark circles, and the darker contour shades on the bottom work great. There is a cool tone, neutral tone, and warm tone for each of the darker and lighter shades. My only drawback is that I love this product so much I&#x27;ve torn through it in under two months!!</li>
    <li> Bought this from Sephora for $20 cheaper! This is a rip off!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing pigments and contour palette though! Blends amazingly!</li>
    <li> This was my first contour kit, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. I love it! I bought it from sephora, and the sales associate showed me how to use it sparingly. I loved that it came with instructions on where to highlight and shade. It came in handy while I was teaching myself to contour. After using this a couple of months contouring has become one of the steps that I do in my makeup routine, and now it&#x27;s as natural as applying mascara. The top middle highlight shade is my favorite and it&#x27;s gone after a few months. Would purchase again just for that shade alone. I put in in the corners of my eyes and under my eyes and it instantly looks like I slept for 5 hours. Highly recommended, but is pricey. Will most likely purchase again and try to extend the life of my favorite highlight next time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing a YouTube video and someone was using it--this stuff is great. I was amazed at the power of contouring!  It looked like I lost 10lbs in my face after using this!  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> In the video, Kat applies this to three different women, but I felt like none of the highlighting shades were bright enough for my skin tone. It was pricey and not worth the hype, especially since you will probably only use two of the shades, one for highlight and one for contour. I would&#x27;ve been better off spending less and buying two single pots of another product.</li>
    <li> The color on this palette are amazing! Kat Von D knows what shes doing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this palette!! Totally recommended. Best one out there. Worth the price! :)</li>
    <li> awesome product! in love</li>
    <li> Best product by far I have ever owned. This beats any other brand and I&#x27;m normally a MAC person. The application is smooth. Your face doesn&#x27;t even feel like it has makeup on.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! Kay Von D Shade + light contouring kit is the best I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;All of the shades will work with a variety of skin tones. It applies easily and blends nicely.&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived only a few days after I ordered it. Very timely and well wrapped.</li>
