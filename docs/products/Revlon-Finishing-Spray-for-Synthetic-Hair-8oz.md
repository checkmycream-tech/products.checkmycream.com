    <li> Love it.  Works really well.  I can style a wig in whatever style I want and it will hold it in place while styling.  Spray wig afterwards for a great hold.  Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE WAY IT&#x27;S HOLD!!!</li>
    <li> Really works good, not too heavy, advised to use vs. regular hair spray, Just a little needed.Good size bottle for the money</li>
    <li> WOW, the fragrance is way to strong. This is for someone whom can handle and likes a very strong scent that lingers. I may have to to give it to someone whom likes strong perfume. Otherwise I would keep it, darn, good price and seems to hold.  I have been using Hair U Wear spray but it is very expensive, but may have to go back because it has a nice hold, hardly notice much of a smell, and after a few minutes smell is gone.  First going to try a few others, hope this help someone.</li>
    <li> It did the job for my synthetic hair wig.  The style remained as I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone who owns a synthetic hair wig.</li>
    <li> Very very nice.  Obviously - I&#x27;m the wife of this account.  I&#x27;ve used many sprays over the years.  This is the best for me.  My hair style is short but moves and can be shaped in different directions.  Most days I prefer a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look; not stiff but in shape.  I need only a light spray, which keeps my style very well.  Just don&#x27;t touch after spraying until it dries (minute or two).  For nights out and more severe styling I spray a bit more to keep everything in place.  I&#x27;ve never noticed any tackiness or scent problems with this spray.</li>
    <li> It almost ruined the wig. It hardened the hair and it made hair look like glue on it.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> works great on all my wigs !!  And great price.</li>
    <li> Provides a great hold, but not stiff or sticky. Holds my style perfectly. Exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> Nothing special - like any other hair spray  It is a spray bottle, not an aerosol, which I like.  no sticky residue</li>
    <li> Holds fairly well.  Is not a super hold hairspray.</li>
    <li> Product works great if sprayed on your wig wet, then brushed in as it dries.  Makes the wigs feels a bit sticky/matted if sprayed on while dry.  I prefer to use generic fabric softener to soak my wigs in during conditioning after giving it a good wash...works much better and leaves the wig silkier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is great. However I will never know as it leaked out all over my box and the pump was broke. It was also shipped with no cap. Whoever shipped it has no clue what they are doing. I wish I was able to even try the product. Disapointed:(</li>
    <li> Good product Great Price and Fast Delivery&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> When I ordered this hair spray it arrived practially empty.  The cap was slightly opened and the whole package stank from hair spray.  I had to call Amazon and have them credit my account.  Which the did right away.  I have not reordered.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works well, holds and washes out without a hassle, smells good too.... I am happy with it</li>
