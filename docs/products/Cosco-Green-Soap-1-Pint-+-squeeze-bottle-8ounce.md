<li> it was bigger than i expected.</li>

<li> About 1/4 of the bottle containing the green soap had spilled out into the bag it was sent in</li>
<li> I did not received my squeezed bottle as the advertisement explained, and the green soap spilled in the enveloped I received it in...</li>
<li> Maybe the false ad is putting a couple extra bucks in their pockets.</li>
<li> The squirt bottle is wonky and doesn&#x27;t always squirt when squeezed.</li>
<li> and they was rude and told me i could have a 2 dollar refund or wait till it was in stock</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never writing a negative feedback, but this just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me...</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with green soap.</li>
<li> so I was a little disappointed about that.</li>
<li> I have nothing bad to say about this purchase ^-^</li>

    <li> (Good) Received on time!  both items as described now for the (not so good) ............. I have nothing bad to say about this purchase ^-^</li>
    <li> Needs better instructions on how to dilute</li>
    <li> This is an awesome deal, the green soap works and smells amazing; the bottle after many uses doesn&#x27;t leak and works as it should. I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with these so I&#x27;d recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> The soap is excellent. Works great and this bottle size will last a while. Only problem was the squeeze bottle broke after only one use.</li>
    <li> The green soap was great, but the squeeze bottle broke the first time I used it. The straw won&#x27;t stay on and the cap leaks.</li>
    <li> The squirt bottle is wonky and doesn&#x27;t always squirt when squeezed.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  They arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I recommend this seller and product.  I cut the tip on the squeeze bottle just a hair.</li>
    <li> Came a lot sooner that estimated. Comes with exactly what&#x27;s in the picture. The bottle is way bigger than expected more than enough to last a while depending on how much tattooing your doing</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with green soap. And with the bottle, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product exactly what I ordered</li>
    <li> About 1/4 of the bottle containing the green soap had spilled out into the bag it was sent in</li>
    <li> It arrived on time when they said it would. I did not notice it said they were temporaily out of the squeeze bottle so I was a little disappointed about that.</li>
    <li> Because it works ! As a tattoo artist , my customers love the smell , and it is a environmently safe !</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. I thought it was a good price for the two but after over a year I still haven&#x27;t gotten the squeeze bottle. After E-mailing them I was told they were out of stock and they would get back to me but of course nothing.</li>
    <li> this product is exactly what i was looking for i would recommend it to any body what an awesome product</li>
    <li> Green soap is great that part of it was perfect but the applicator doesn&#x27;t work well and gets clogged easily.</li>
    <li> Got everything super fast. great job.</li>
    <li> Came very quick the only brink em I have with it is the squeeze bottle gets gummed up so I had to cut it down a bit</li>
    <li> Very helpful with the sterilization.</li>
    <li> The straw in the squeeze bottle is very fragile and tears easily</li>
    <li> Order did not come with bottle, only soap. It&#x27;s fine, but they should advertise it correctly!</li>
    <li> its the best accept no substitute</li>
    <li> This is a xmas present for my granddaughter.  She hasn&#x27;t gotten it yet so don&#x27;t know if she likes it.  However, it is what she asked for so guess she will be surprised.</li>
    <li> it was bigger than i expected. i just love the smell of green soap a lot, five stars woo ha</li>
    <li> The squeeze bottle is different from pictured. It it still works okay. Green soap is perfect though.</li>
    <li> This looks like a trend. Maybe the false ad is putting a couple extra bucks in their pockets. I should have read the reviews before ordering.</li>
    <li> I did not received my squeezed bottle as the advertisement explained, and the green soap spilled in the enveloped I received it in... I&#x27;ve never writing a negative feedback, but this just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me... Think twice before you decide to order...</li>
    <li> The squirt bottle that came with the green soap was very convenient. It arrived quick and lasted quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Worked great at getting the spot out.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave two stars is that I still have not received the squeeze bottle and in their add it did not say they were out of stock and they could not tell me when they would get it back in stock and their reply emails were kinda rude</li>
    <li> package came earlier than expected but did not recieve everything. I didn&#x27;t recieve my squirt bottle and they said it was out of stock but it was in stock when I ordered. They said I would recieve in a week and never did. contacted them a month later and they was rude and told me i could have a 2 dollar refund or wait till it was in stock hence they would ship it then, Do not buy from parashs they will rip you off they even sell fake ink dont fall for there fake advertising, other then that the green soap is very good and works great, packaged well and bottle didn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great bottle, green soap always works great.  Was packaged perfect so it didn&#x27;t leak in shipping.</li>
    <li> perfect for doing tattoos I&#x27;m squeezing away</li>
    <li> Great soap and the bottle is reusable. Still use it to this day I bought this back in 2014</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s real green soap, um a good buy so stop reading reviews, buy this thing and get back to layin INK ppl.</li>
    <li> Received exactly what I expected. Soap and squirt bottle. Thanks</li>
