      <li>This blush is amazing!</li>
      <li>this is the most beautiful touch of pigment for the summer!!!!</li>
      <li>nice color with a beautiful shimmer.</li>
      <li>Color is good - maybe a bit brighter than it looks in the picture..</li>
      <li>but I thought it would be good to let people know it is NOT like Luminoso at all.</li>
      <li>Like all Milani blushes, the pigment is wonderful and the application is smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and don&#x27;t tan my face at all.</li>
      <li>I am very, very pleased.  </li>
      <li>love this blush!</li>
      <li>would buy more from this line!</li>
      <li>These blushes are amazing.</li>
      <li>Kind of a dupe for Nars Orgasm,</li>
      <li>I love this blusher so much!!!!!</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t really notice it on your face, but when swatched it is so sparkly and gorgeous!</li>
      <li>I do have to be sure to start with very light application and gradually darken.</li>
      <li>My favorite blush EVER.</li>
      <li>I love the color of this blush and how it just gives you some color to your cheeks.</li>
      <li>Personally, i love the sparkles and glitter.</li>
      <li>I am placing this review under every Milani blush I have tried, as it doesn&#x27;t seem as though these products are getting the love they deserve.</li>
      <li>I am looking forward to purchasing more of these.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with the Milani Baked Blush in Luminoso, so after falling in love with that shade I wanted to try the rest.</li>
      <li>packaging is kind of dicey and cheap.</li>
      <li>love Nars blush, at $28 a pan</li>
      <li>Milani has done a great job with their baked blush, the color is perfect and it  has great color payoff as well as wonderful staying power, I would recommend these to everyone, a little goes a very long way so it will last forever.</li>
      <li>Their amazing and worth the $8-10$ :)</li>
      <li>They have amazing long wear and great color</li>
      <li>Perfect color with a little bit of sparkle...</li>
      <li>This would look so amazing on skin tones that are much darker than mine, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish it would be super sparkly on my skin when applied, but when used with a brush and blended, the glitter disappears by a huge amount.</li>
      <li>Thanks :)    </li>
      <li>Normally I run screaming from corals but recently developed a new appreciation for them, and this is the perfect shade for the coral-leery.</li>
      <li>It is super flattering</li>
      <li>This blush was a bit darker and had more red in it than I expected but the quality of the blush is very good.  </li>
      <li>It is a Very Pretty Blush.  </li>
      <li>Very Pretty -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this off of a you tube recommendation, and it is so pretty!</li>
      <li>I love this blush so much that I wrote this review the very day</li>
      <li>Loved it so much bought every other baked blush.</li>
      <li>NARS is on the peachy side but still pretty close.</li>
      <li>and it gives my cheeks a really pretty glow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying it again:)</li>
      <li>This blush is really pretty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty but has no staying power</li>
      <li>This color is so pretty on my skin tone and not shimmery at all</li>
      <li>it is a very coral color and VERY shimmery, Not my choice for everyday wear (which is what i was hoping, thus the missing 5th star) but great for special occasions and the right outfit go along.</li>
      <li>The color is really much prettier when applied on skin than how it looks with the silver swirls.  </li>
      <li>I am absolutely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use the Real Techniques brushes and my Smashbox contour brush, depending on how much color and where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>that is a crack habit I can&#x27;t support very often.</li>
      <li>If I am not tan, if I am pale, if I am tan, it still looks amazing because you can layer it up without looking Cakie....</li>
      <li>Overall this blush is very beautiful and a little goes a long way...</li>
      <li>I dare you to compare this blush to any high end blush product....</li>
      <li>It is a mix of juicy peach, mango, a little pineapple and papaya; it&#x27;s stunning.</li>
      <li>Its extremely silky and easy to blend.</li>
      <li>but I think this one is a little more red and</li>
      <li>great value for the price ... goes on a little heavy - that&#x27;s my only &amp;#34;complaint.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The only issue I have with it is it&#x27;s mainly a nighttime party blush since it has a lot of glitter in it.</li>
      <li>I am very pale, and this color took only one light swipe, and it looked natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it, but don&#x27;t really like the sparkles as I am not much for &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; on my face.</li>

<li> SO pigmented a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> The blush arrived in a pulverized heap that had leaked out of the packaging and onto my other order items.</li>
<li> I have really dark skin</li>
<li> Note though that the color will become one solid color mix and not the delicately veined color that it was before it smashed to bits.</li>
<li> I put it on with a thick brush and it blends instantly.  </li>
<li> I have tanned olive skin, dark brown hair and black eyes.  </li>
<li> But you can collect the broken contents, mix with enough 99% alcohol to make a paste, and re-press this into another container if you need to.</li>
<li> So, I am a makeup junkie, I usually have a blush in every purse, car, and ever where I go.</li>
<li> Or at least few on Amazon are saying so!</li>
<li> , basically means I look sick</li>
<li> brush included with it is worthless.</li>
<li> The packaging was horrific.</li>

    <li> This blush is really pretty. I have really dark skin and it gives my cheeks a really pretty glow. The only issue I have with it is it&#x27;s mainly a nighttime party blush since it has a lot of glitter in it. Tapping my brush didn&#x27;t get rid of the excess, but I still like this product.</li>
    <li> Very Pretty -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I made this purchase.  It is a Very Pretty Blush.  I am very, very pleased.  I am looking forward to purchasing more of these.  I am absolutely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;F.E. Manuel</li>
    <li> I love this blusher so much!!!!! Oh olive tan skin and this is the most beautiful touch of pigment for the summer!!!! It has some shimmer to it so there&#x27;s and added highlight!!</li>
    <li> Check out my review on this product on YOUTUBE! Thanks :)    [...]</li>
    <li> Milani has done a great job with their baked blush, the color is perfect and it  has great color payoff as well as wonderful staying power, I would recommend these to everyone, a little goes a very long way so it will last forever.</li>
    <li> I am placing this review under every Milani blush I have tried, as it doesn&#x27;t seem as though these products are getting the love they deserve. Or at least few on Amazon are saying so! With the Milani blush, don&#x27;t look at a color and say, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wear that because of my coloring\\&quot;. YES YOU CAN. These blushes are amazing. EVERY SINGLE COLOR has worked with my coloring, whether it is pink, peach, purple, red...anyone can wear these. I think even darker skin tones could wear these even as highlighters if nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for the color CORALLINA. I am very pale, and this color took only one light swipe, and it looked natural. Normally I run screaming from corals but recently developed a new appreciation for them, and this is the perfect shade for the coral-leery. It is not as \\&quot;watermelon&#x27; as it appears here! It is a mix of juicy peach, mango, a little pineapple and papaya; it&#x27;s stunning. NOT SHIMMERY. This would look so amazing on skin tones that are much darker than mine, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Nars blush, at $28 a pan that is a crack habit I can&#x27;t support very often. I picked up these Milani blushes in every color. I dare you to compare this blush to any high end blush product....ANY. They have amazing long wear and great color payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The brush included with it is worthless. Unless you *LIKE* your blush to look like stripes of war paint! I use the Real Techniques brushes and my Smashbox contour brush, depending on how much color and where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The packaging is kind of dicey and cheap. That is no indication however, of the quality of the product inside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t drop it, whatever you do! It will shatter even from a short fall. But you can collect the broken contents, mix with enough 99% alcohol to make a paste, and re-press this into another container if you need to. Note though that the color will become one solid color mix and not the delicately veined color that it was before it smashed to bits. However it will still look the same on your face.ill still look the same on your face.</li>
    <li> This blush is divine coral shade that is perfect for summer. Like all Milani blushes, the pigment is wonderful and the application is smooth. HOWEVER. The packaging was horrific. The blush arrived in a pulverized heap that had leaked out of the packaging and onto my other order items. I don&#x27;t see myself ordering from this seller again. I wound up having to dump whatever blush I could salvage into another makeup container.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the Milani Baked Blush in Luminoso, so after falling in love with that shade I wanted to try the rest. Unfortunately this shade Corallina has massive flecks of glitter in it unlike the finely milled ones in Luminoso. I bought this one based on the save reviews I&#x27;ve read but I thought it would be good to let people know it is NOT like Luminoso at all. Beware of glitter!</li>
    <li> Perfect color with a little bit of sparkle...perfect summer blush.</li>
    <li> Color is good - maybe a bit brighter than it looks in the picture.. I&#x27;m using it, but don&#x27;t really like the sparkles as I am not much for &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; on my face.</li>
    <li> My favorite blush EVER. I never leave the house without wearing it. Personally, i love the sparkles and glitter. I wish it would be super sparkly on my skin when applied, but when used with a brush and blended, the glitter disappears by a huge amount. You won&#x27;t really notice it on your face, but when swatched it is so sparkly and gorgeous! Its extremely silky and easy to blend. If you&#x27;re hesitant on buying a milani baked blush, don&#x27;t be! Their amazing and worth the $8-10$ :)</li>
    <li> this is a great and must have to your collection. nice color with a beautiful shimmer. stays on all days! would buy more from this line!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but has no staying power</li>
    <li> love this blush! great value for the price ... goes on a little heavy - that&#x27;s my only &amp;#34;complaint.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have tanned olive skin, dark brown hair and black eyes.  This color is so pretty on my skin tone and not shimmery at all (thank goodness...not a fan of shimmery blushes).  The color is really much prettier when applied on skin than how it looks with the silver swirls.  I love this blush so much that I wrote this review the very day I had applied it on my face.</li>
    <li> SO pigmented a little goes a long way. Kind of a dupe for Nars Orgasm, but I think this one is a little more red and NARS is on the peachy side but still pretty close.</li>
    <li> I put it on with a thick brush and it blends instantly.  It does have a little sparkle, but no big sparkly flakes.</li>
    <li> This blush was a bit darker and had more red in it than I expected but the quality of the blush is very good.  I like this brand but not this color.</li>
    <li> I bought this off of a you tube recommendation, and it is so pretty! I do have to be sure to start with very light application and gradually darken. it is a very coral color and VERY shimmery, Not my choice for everyday wear (which is what i was hoping, thus the missing 5th star) but great for special occasions and the right outfit go along.</li>
    <li> So, I am a makeup junkie, I usually have a blush in every purse, car, and ever where I go. I have a yellow skin undertone, basically means I look sick if I don&#x27;t have blush on. This blush does the trick. If I am not tan, if I am pale, if I am tan, it still looks amazing because you can layer it up without looking Cakie....great blush, great Seller.!</li>
    <li> This blush is amazing! It&#x27;s a beautiful color and it blends well into the skin. It does have shimmer but the shimmer doesn&#x27;t pass off as unnatural. Overall this blush is very beautiful and a little goes a long way... I&#x27;m definitely buying it again:)</li>
    <li> I love the color of this blush and how it just gives you some color to your cheeks. It is super flattering and I want to buy all of them now! &lt;3</li>
    <li> OMG these are so wonderful. I bought the Lumenesco because of Jaclyn Hill on YouTube. Loved it so much bought every other baked blush. I&#x27;m fair skinned and don&#x27;t tan my face at all. Every color is so wonderful.</li>
