      <li>This is the perfect baby blue.  </li>

      <li>This blue is ideal!</li>
      <li>Just keep filling your nails down till they look beautiful lol.   </li>
      <li>The perfect light blue!  </li>
      <li>Very opaque, beautiful color, and pretty finish.</li>
      <li>and even after a full 7 days of the polish still looking new with  no chips or peeling, I loved it even more.</li>
      <li>The shade of blue is exactly like the picture, if not a bit lighter, but it looks excellent when put on.</li>
      <li>Arrived quick in bubble wrap!</li>
      <li>2 coats using light, even strokes gave me maximum opacity.</li>
      <li>Arrived in excellent condition, brand new, and if you&#x27;re looking for a baby/sky blue, this is the one!!</li>
      <li>The color is unique.</li>
      <li>Original Essie varnishes are .5oz(15ml)</li>
      <li>I am completely in LOVE with this particular color!  </li>
      <li>blue and looks gorgeous with my ring.</li>
      <li>Chips easily , but it is really pretty</li>
      <li>I loved the color, but this kind of creamy color is hard to make even on the nails, since I am no pro.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more on a pastel side, and without being too eye catching complements your nails in any season because it is minimal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color, definitely one of my new favorites.</li>
      <li>It really stayed on well and didn&#x27;t chip too easily.</li>
      <li>Add a self-leveling top coat such as Seche Vite and your nails will look great for a relatively long time.</li>
      <li>This is such a beautiful light Blue.</li>
      <li>but this is the first Essie Polish I&#x27;ve had to chip off so quickly.</li>
      <li>It has a very opaque first coat and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful blue, always get complimented on it.</li>
      <li>,it was solid in two coats and if you put a good top coat every other day it will not chip.</li>
      <li>I did not purchase Borrowed &amp; Blue for a wedding but more of a calm fall color.</li>
      <li>You will be fine with just 2 coats and Seche Vite Fast Dry top coat.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a pretty  color-</li>
      <li>i bought this for a friend who was getting married.  </li>
      <li>All came individually wrapped in bubble wrap so that they remained safe during shipping.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS SOOOOO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND BUY IT NOW !!</li>
      <li>I think I was able to get away with using only one cotton ball to remove!</li>
      <li>Two coats is more than enough for coverage.</li>
      <li>Essie tends to be like that in general, so one thick coat is the best way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>all essie products are high quality, long lasting, and with beautiful color.</li>
      <li>I love the color, but miss my long nails.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of blue polishes.  </li>
      <li>Ladies stop using your nails as tools and please wear gloves when your cleaning you will be able to maintain them just by being careful with them.</li>
      <li>The product shipped extremely fast.</li>
      <li>I first came across this colour at a nail place in Normal, IL.</li>
      <li>If you have a tan, this polish will really pop!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I usually wear Cult -wicked fast top coat or CND super shiney</li>
      <li>Stunning light blue with a very slight shimmer.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a polish you can wear without a topcoat as it doesn&#x27;t dry with a smooth finish.   </li>
      <li>The only problem is that it didn&#x27;t last for more than 2 days.</li>
      <li>On short nails, I absolutely love this color, especially on my toes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It reminds me of a new Spring</li>
      <li>It goes on a bit sheer, so I suggest just slopping it on at first and then wiping the excess off the edges.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great Color and Staying Power. takes 3 coats to become opaque. Essie polish is always a little runnier and thinner than other polishes but the staying and anti chipping power makes up for it.</li>
    <li> This review is for Essie&#x27;s Borrowed and Blue, a very pale blue (not baby blue, but Easter/Spring/Summer gorgeous blue that makes your tan pop!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish is gorgeous. It&#x27;s not too gray, not too white, not too blue. The pigment is well-mixed, does not go on streaky, had no trouble with bubbles. This is an OPAQUE color by Essie. Two coats is more than enough for coverage. Add a self-leveling top coat such as Seche Vite and your nails will look great for a relatively long time. No chipping and came off very easily with acetone--I think I was able to get away with using only one cotton ball to remove! It does not stain your nails (there isn&#x27;t really enough pigment for that) and it&#x27;s appropriate for work, beach, interview, you name it. If you have a tan, this polish will really pop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I loved the color, but this kind of creamy color is hard to make even on the nails, since I am no pro. Very beautiful for summer and spring time.  Although, I would make a point that the shade is a bit darker in person than in computer.</li>
    <li> My fiancee had me order this for her cousins engagement party gift.  This item also appears to be the same as the item you would get in Ulta.</li>
    <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS COLOR! it runs very smoothly and is about four dollars cheaper than in stores ! IT STAYS ON MY NAILS FOR SO LONG AND NEVER EVER CHIPS OFF ! which is amazing because i think it lasted on my nails for a month without chipping! THIS IS SOOOOO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND BUY IT NOW !!</li>
    <li> I bought this color for my engagement photos and absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s a perfect &amp;#34;wedding&amp;#34; blue and looks gorgeous with my ring.</li>
    <li> This is the PERFECT blue. I can do only 2 coats and be done! Very opaque, beautiful color, and pretty finish. Love this color. Hope they rerelease this color!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this seller&#x27;s service. My order arrived quickly and the quality is great. The price was a steal for this brand of polish too! Can&#x27;t wait to buy my next color!</li>
    <li> The perfect light blue!  Very delicate and opaque.  You will be fine with just 2 coats and Seche Vite Fast Dry top coat.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail polish and it was an awesome product! I saw it in my local store and it was double the price. The product shipped extremely fast.</li>
    <li> this color is perfect for summer, exaclty like in the picture, i get a lot of compliments from this colour</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order from online, because the product is either old or fake. Quality is completely different from the ones you buy in store. It paints on very chunky and really a waste of money. Super disappointed!</li>
    <li> I ordered 10+ of this color nail polish.  All came individually wrapped in bubble wrap so that they remained safe during shipping.  I have not used any myself or opened the polish as I will be using these for client gifts.  The shipping was quick and everything arrive perfect!  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I love the color but this is the first Essie Polish I&#x27;ve had to chip off so quickly. I&#x27;m not sure why this particular color does this (I have around 15 polishes with this brand and none of the others do this).</li>
    <li> This color is beautifully understated. Not too blue but has just enough color to be subtle and classy. It reminds me of a Cinderella blue. It arrived within 2 days ( I was quoted 5 days). Very impressed.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect baby blue! The shade of blue is exactly like the picture, if not a bit lighter, but it looks excellent when put on. It has a very opaque first coat and goes on smoothly. Arrived in excellent condition, brand new, and if you&#x27;re looking for a baby/sky blue, this is the one!! Definitely get it, high quality, goes on well.</li>
    <li> Great name and color and so practical as a wedding accessory. My daughter in law to be loved the idea</li>
    <li> I get compliments everytime I wear this color. Great color to have your nail tech polish because it&#x27;s thick and opaque and hard to polish.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect baby blue.  I have many Essie polishes.  This is one of the best i&#x27;v bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;perfect</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color, I just feel ripped off. Original Essie varnishes are .5oz(15ml) this bottle contains 0.46oz(13.5ml) and the information on the label is incorrect.</li>
    <li> I saw a girl wearing this color during a youtube video and knew I had to have it.  A lot of times I&#x27;m disappointed with the creamy opaque type colors as they are streaky and hard to apply.  That is not the case with this shade.  It goes on smoothy and covers in two coats.  It&#x27;s a beautiful color, definitely one of my new favorites.</li>
    <li> On brown skin this color is rather *bright*. On short nails, I absolutely love this color, especially on my toes. On medium to long nails, this polish can appear anything from just okay to scary. If you have brown skin, I would suggest this color only if you wear blues well. Just keep filling your nails down till they look beautiful lol.   Unlike the other Essie colors I&#x27;ve tried, this one doesn&#x27;t dry much darker than it appears in the bottle. Also, the consistency is a little off. This isn&#x27;t a polish you can wear without a topcoat as it doesn&#x27;t dry with a smooth finish.   If I didn&#x27;t have to file my nails all the way down, I would have given this polish 5 stars instead of 4. I love the color, but miss my long nails.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to find a good Tiffany or eggshell blue for awhile, however some blues can appear too flashy or not as classy. This blue is ideal! It&#x27;s more on a pastel side, and without being too eye catching complements your nails in any season because it is minimal. It&#x27;s just simply a very pretty color and am happy I got it.</li>
    <li> color really nice consistency great,it was solid in two coats and if you put a good top coat every other day it will not chip.Ladies stop using your nails as tools and please wear gloves when your cleaning you will be able to maintain them just by being careful with them.</li>
    <li> Color is exactly what I expected. Stunning light blue with a very slight shimmer. Essie nail polish is always quality. If used with Essie base and top coat the nail polish doesn&#x27;t chip for like a week.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture, it&#x27;s a great color! Works as a great gift too since it&#x27;s so refreshing and calming.</li>
    <li> The color is unique. So beautiful. The only problem is that it didn&#x27;t last for more than 2 days. Chips easily , but it is really pretty</li>
    <li> This is everything you&#x27;d want in a Cinderella-blue nail polish: prettily pale, opaque enough that it was suitable for my toes after one coat, not streaky, and capped with a shiny gloss. Not a bubble to be found. Very dainty and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> ...but I might wear it to someone else&#x27;s. it&#x27;s a pretty  color- just faintly blue, but crisp and simple. It goes on a bit sheer, so I suggest just slopping it on at first and then wiping the excess off the edges. If you try to do it in layers, it takes forever to dry completely and is more likely to peel off in sheets within a few days. Essie tends to be like that in general, so one thick coat is the best way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of a new Spring sky-- whatever that means.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase Borrowed &amp; Blue for a wedding but more of a calm fall color. It looks great after two coats. I usually wear Cult -wicked fast top coat or CND super shiney and it looks great.</li>
    <li> I first came across this colour at a nail place in Normal, IL. The lady told me I could have it as a going away gift. When I used it, my feet looked amazing in contrast to my skin tone. I got so many compliments on it. I applied them with white french tips. I had to re-purchase because I ran out of the first small bottle. This is much bigger and I have used it for a pedicure again and I have to say they are still lovely!&lt;br /&gt;May not look as good if your skin tone is very light, seeing as this is a light colour itself.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful blue, always get complimented on it.</li>
    <li> This is such a beautiful light Blue. It has a luminosity to it that glows through. Great neutral color for a wedding day!</li>
    <li> gorgeous color!! Always getting compliments , I imagine it looking even better with a tan!!! Arrived quick in bubble wrap!</li>
    <li> This item was exactly as described and fit our wedding colors perfectly! Could not ask for a better product! A+</li>
    <li> I love Essie polishes and this one is now one of my favorites! Its adorable and stays on forever. Gorgeous color.</li>
    <li> i bought this for a friend who was getting married.  all essie products are high quality, long lasting, and with beautiful color.</li>
    <li> This is a great Spring color. I received quite a few compliments when I wore it recently. It really stayed on well and didn&#x27;t chip too easily. I do recommend putting on a couple very thin coats because it bubbled a little when I put on a thick second coat.</li>
    <li> I received this product with 3-4 days which wasn&#x27;t bad at all! Now the product itself....&lt;br /&gt;LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! the color!!! and even after a full 7 days of the polish still looking new with  no chips or peeling, I loved it even more. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased two bottles!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of blue polishes.  I am completely in LOVE with this particular color!  It&#x27;s just a perfect, pastel blue.  2 coats using light, even strokes gave me maximum opacity. The formula is just like every other Essie polish I have - not too thick, not too thin.  I apply with a Seche base and a Seche top.</li>
</ol>
