It&#x27;s a perfect blend of exquisiteness and refinement, but doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; to where she wouldn&#x27;t wear it just to go to the mall or visit with family.

    <li> My wife was quite surprised when I told her I ordered her a present (not that I don&#x27;t buy her presents but this was really random).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave her a hint, D.O.T.  She could not figure out how her present had anything to do with the Department of Transportation.  A day before it arrived we happened to be shopping at Sams.  As we passed the perfume area I looked at the case and smiled.  She then saw the Dot and put 2 and 2 together.  We had a good laugh and the next day it arrived.  She really loves the scent and I do to.  It&#x27;s sweet smelling and but not sickly sweet or annoying.</li>
    <li> For such a highly rated product, and known name, the sent wasn&#x27;t that great, and it doesn&#x27;t last long. i have tried other products that aren&#x27;t so well known and last longer. I don&#x27;t even use it. In my opinion, it was a waste of money.</li>
