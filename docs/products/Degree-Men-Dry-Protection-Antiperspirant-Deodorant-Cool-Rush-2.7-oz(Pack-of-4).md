### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great smell!</li>
      <li>Good Deodorant that doesnt break me out!  </li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>After reviewing the orders I noticed that they charged $63.00 to ship 4 sticks of deoderant....Not happy about that</li>
      <li>This is a great buy when needing to buy in bulk.  </li>
      <li>was great would buy again</li>
      <li>And I stopped here and was happy.  </li>
      <li>What else can I say this is the brand I use at a great price.</li>
      <li>The scent is very nice too.  </li>
      <li>Great under arm protection, and a good value for the money.</li>
      <li>And it works really good.  </li>
      <li>And it a good price</li>
      <li>Great price for how many came in the package</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s way more convenient.</li>
      <li>Most antiperspirants will leave a mark where the product rubbed off on the shirt.  </li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>this is all my husband uses so to get so many at one time</li>
      <li>I have been using Degree for about 3 years now, and I haven&#x27;t found a better deodorant anywhere.  </li>
      <li>Smells awesome and last all day.</li>
      <li>lol, you have to wash them or they will have a white stain.</li>
      <li>Thanks! : )</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and not overbearing, it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; smell like old Spice, it is an unobtrusive product that keeps you smelling good all day.</li>
      <li>It smells good and helps keep you dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge Degree fan and it seems to work very well for me.</li>
      <li>Really nice deal, will last you for some time.</li>
      <li>I really like the Cool Rush scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;they work well, last a long time, and the 4 pack price was a good deal with the free prime shipping.</li>
      <li>about the same price as big box stores but the multi pak is nice and ammazon makes it easy</li>
      <li>I assume that those interested in buying deodorant in bulk should know if they like the product before doing so.</li>
      <li>Years ago I used to use Mitchum Roll On because it was the only deoderant that kept me smelling OK.</li>
      <li>good product same as locally bought.</li>
      <li>The 4 pack last a while, but it makes it easy in the sense that I don&#x27;t have to stop by the drug store to get a one or two pack.</li>
      <li>It doesnt last as long as I&#x27;d like, but for the price I think it&#x27;s a better alternative to the &#x27;Advanced&#x27; stuff...</li>
      <li>My recomendation is find someone who can ship for a reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t stink as much as I used to, but I will not change to anything else.</li>
      <li>No sweat stains, no over drying, and &#x27;Cool Rush&#x27; has an addictive scent.</li>
      <li>I have used this particular brand and scent for years and it has always worked for me.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for all guys,  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>The smell was good and it did last me usually for the entire day.</li>
      <li>Buying the four pack saves me a trip to the store and lasts long enough to be well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I love the Degree deodorant, I use a few different scents, but never different</li>
      <li>but it is the white not the clear.</li>
      <li>Again, the product works very well, but it is certainly NOT invisible.</li>
      <li>It will leave a white residue on your armpits, and even on your clothes if you are not careful when getting dressed.</li>
      <li>I ordered this with a bunch of other stuff from different vendors, so I didn&#x27;t pay too much attention to the overall price.</li>
      <li>The only problem was that it says they dry invisible but clearly my shirts say otherwise</li>
      <li>I was very wet and would leave stains on my clothes, but other things (Right Guard/Speed Stick) didn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>

    <li> I was not aware of prices on this Item, and I am giving it 4 stars for it&#x27;s quality. I would&#x27;ve had save money if I had purchased it locally as I would not have to pay for shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been using Degree for about 3 years now, and I haven&#x27;t found a better deodorant anywhere.  Not only does it stop the sweating, but it doesn&#x27;t clog up your pores, creating painful infected pores.  This stuff also lives up to it&#x27;s name.  I can&#x27;t remember a time in recent history when armpit sweat has been an issue.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great.  The scent is very nice too.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a film at all. Highly recommend for all guys,  Try it you&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant. Smells awesome and last all day. Plus, a four pack?! Thanks! : )</li>
    <li> The is my deorderant of choice.  I have been using Degree for about 3 years, and will continue.  Great under arm protection, and a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy when needing to buy in bulk.  Got 4 of these and has lasted me the hole year</li>
    <li> I assume that those interested in buying deodorant in bulk should know if they like the product before doing so. I have used this particular brand and scent for years and it has always worked for me. Buying the four pack saves me a trip to the store and lasts long enough to be well worth the price. The scent is fresh and not overbearing, it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; smell like old Spice, it is an unobtrusive product that keeps you smelling good all day.</li>
    <li> Buying these again last all day and my job require allot of physical work and I smell like a garden if roses yeah buddy</li>
    <li> Degree makes quality products, and I can not argue with how well this deodorant works. My problem is that this is listed as an \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; stick, and it certainly is not. It will leave a white residue on your armpits, and even on your clothes if you are not careful when getting dressed. Again, the product works very well, but it is certainly NOT invisible. Either this seller shipped me the wrong product, or the labeling on the listing is false.</li>
    <li> Really nice deal, will last you for some time. The smell was good and it did last me usually for the entire day. The only problem was that it says they dry invisible but clearly my shirts say otherwise lol, you have to wash them or they will have a white stain. Anyways I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It smells good and helps keep you dry. Kinda like it is supposed to. And ordering it from here is cheaper then driving to the store.</li>
    <li> I bought the 4 pack and it is horrible. It gave me a dry red rash under my pit. I also feel all twitchy and itchy all over my body, especially my arms. They are red and bumpy. Dont buy this!</li>
    <li> I love the Degree deodorant, I use a few different scents, but never different brands.&lt;br /&gt;they work well, last a long time, and the 4 pack price was a good deal with the free prime shipping.</li>
    <li> Great price for how many came in the package this is all my husband uses so to get so many at one time was great would buy again</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of different antiperspirants and they all failed my test, until this one.  And I stopped here and was happy.  If you have to take your shirt off, and put it back on again.  Most antiperspirants will leave a mark where the product rubbed off on the shirt.  Even if they claim &#x27;invisible&#x27;, they are not.  But this one IS.  And it works really good.  And it a good price</li>
    <li> Long lasting protection! Great smell! Recommend this deodorant.</li>
    <li> Years ago I used to use Mitchum Roll On because it was the only deoderant that kept me smelling OK. I was very wet and would leave stains on my clothes, but other things (Right Guard/Speed Stick) didn&#x27;t seem to work. I have been using Degree for about 10 years now and even when trekking through the woods in the middle of the summer, I don&#x27;t smell my pits at all. Maybe I don&#x27;t stink as much as I used to, but I will not change to anything else.</li>
    <li> I really like the Cool Rush scent. I&#x27;m a huge Degree fan and it seems to work very well for me. The 4 pack last a while, but it makes it easy in the sense that I don&#x27;t have to stop by the drug store to get a one or two pack.</li>
    <li> No sweat stains, no over drying, and &#x27;Cool Rush&#x27; has an addictive scent. She cant keep her hands off me.</li>
    <li> Altough it does the task, I don&#x27;t like the scent. Next time, I will buy a different scent</li>
    <li> What else can I say this is the brand I use at a great price. I will do it again</li>
    <li> It doesnt last as long as I&#x27;d like, but for the price I think it&#x27;s a better alternative to the &#x27;Advanced&#x27; stuff...</li>
    <li> I started using this product fifteen years ago when several other similar products started giving me problems with burning arm pits.  No problem with Degree</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at walmart, but now I can buy in 4 packs from amazon for the same price. Plus it&#x27;s way more convenient.</li>
    <li> Good Deodorant that doesnt break me out!  I like that it comes in the bulk pack as you can save a little money!</li>
    <li> good product same as locally bought. says invisible but it is the white not the clear. about the same price as big box stores but the multi pak is nice and ammazon makes it easy</li>
    <li> I ordered this with a bunch of other stuff from different vendors, so I didn&#x27;t pay too much attention to the overall price. After reviewing the orders I noticed that they charged $63.00 to ship 4 sticks of deoderant....Not happy about that but my bad for not looking more carefully at the price. My recomendation is find someone who can ship for a reasonable cost.</li>
