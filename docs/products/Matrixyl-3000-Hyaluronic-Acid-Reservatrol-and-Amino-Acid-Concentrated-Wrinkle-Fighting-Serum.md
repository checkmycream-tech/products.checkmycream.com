      <li>is an amazing serum</li>

      <li>price is not horrible ..  </li>
      <li>I love the way this product smells and my skin seems to soak it up.  </li>
      <li>Still going to give it more time and see</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
      <li>My eyes look better and the dryness in my face is better to.</li>
      <li>Maybe it is too potent.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m 34 but squinting, smiling etc has given me some wrinkles that I was hoping would fill in a bit more.</li>
      <li>I use a sunscreen on top.</li>
      <li>okay, I recommend it for sure</li>

      <li>They are absolutely 100% purists and have a strong belief in using only the best ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It does make my skin feel tighter, but I can&#x27;t say any of my lines have really filled in.</li>
      <li>My favorite use is right after I use my microderma roller.</li>

      <li>I found that it helped with fine lines particularly around the eye.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And there are many equivalent products available from other sellers.</li>

      <li>The compliments on my skin have really increased.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for over a month now, I can&#x27;t say I notice any real difference</li>
      <li>I have not seen major changes but I like it because it is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second order and in conjunction with obagi c 5% around my eyes and regular exfoliation with Cure Aqua Gel, I have completely removes fine lines, although my expression lines remain.</li>
      <li>Specifically to the product, I would say it might be valuable for consumers to know that the color of the liquid is naturally a yellow-ish color, which was a question I had upon receiving.  </li>
      <li>Also, it completely took years off of my lips.</li>
      <li>41 year old smoker with Asian/Anglo skin and years of sun damage</li>
      <li>I bought this product to help my skin look young again.</li>
      <li>The ingredients contained in it are what I want and at a reasonable price for long term usage.</li>
      <li>I work in the Aesthetic industry and am open to trying new products.  </li>
      <li>I initially was using Vine Expert by Caudalie which is a very good yet expensive product...around $100 for a few ounces.</li>
      <li>A facial oil (which are all the rage now)...very affordable with thesame ingredients at the $80 Kiehls facial oil and other high priced brands.</li>

    <li> Not sure I noticed a difference ...  I don&#x27;t hate it ... price is not horrible ..  I just don&#x27;t know about it ... this is one of those might not work for me ...  but might be great for you ... products ...  know what I mean?</li>
    <li> This serum is better than Perric0ne MD&#x27;s facial conforming serum without the $330+ price tag. My skin is smoother with more elasticity since I started using it. A little bit goes a long way. I feel like I got a great deal!</li>
    <li> I initially was using Vine Expert by Caudalie which is a very good yet expensive product...around $100 for a few ounces. I found that it helped with fine lines particularly around the eye. I decided to look up the ingredients that were in Vine Expert and found this product had the same ingredients...same looking and smelling as well for a fraction of the price. Can&#x27;t beat it! Use it daily under my AM moisturizer. And for those of you beauty devotees...check out Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum. A facial oil (which are all the rage now)...very affordable with thesame ingredients at the $80 Kiehls facial oil and other high priced brands.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! A lot of facial serums claim to go on under makeup or moisturizers with ease, but end up leaving the face feeling too thick with product. This serum, however, is very thin and indeed works well under makeup or other products. The smell is not very pleasant, but I can live with that!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT, EFFECTIVE serum (used as directed)......Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this product in combination with an antioxidant lotion and caffeine lotion. I also use whipped shea and coco butter on the days I don&#x27;t use the aforementioned products. I like this product. It does help healing and irritation. I believe it also helps rejuvenate the skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay...nothing super to report about it, but nothing negative either!! I&#x27;ll continue to use til its gone, but will not repurchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help my skin look young again. I&#x27;ve only used it for 4 days now and already my skin is firmer, looks younger, my lines are less severe and i have the glow I&#x27;ve been missing for years.&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing serum and i highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The customer service and dedication to quality of this company is the highest of probably any company I have EVER worked with.  They are absolutely 100% purists and have a strong belief in using only the best ingredients.  They will respond promptly and helpfully to any inquiry with above-and-beyond care.  I just had to rate them because of this!  I simply could not believe the responses and help they gave me in response to my questions!  Specifically to the product, I would say it might be valuable for consumers to know that the color of the liquid is naturally a yellow-ish color, which was a question I had upon receiving.  It has a pleasant feel.  I will update once I have been using the product for a couple months on the effects!</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day, face neck and chest and it lasts forever. I&#x27;m on my second order and in conjunction with obagi c 5% around my eyes and regular exfoliation with Cure Aqua Gel, I have completely removes fine lines, although my expression lines remain. 41 year old smoker with Asian/Anglo skin and years of sun damage and now I&#x27;m taking some time back. Also, it completely took years off of my lips. Using a number of their products now. Big fan. Especially after dumping tons of money into products that cost hundreds per month with little to no result... This stuff rocks. Just exfoliate for better absorption.</li>
    <li> I have not seen major changes but I like it because it is not greasy and absorbs quickly. I consider it good product</li>
    <li> I think this is am excellent product and have already reordered it. Used twice a day, one bottle lasted @ 3 1/2-4 weeks. The ingredients contained in it are what I want and at a reasonable price for long term usage. Yes, I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is actually the product I wanted to order but somehow it was mixed up! I would like to torder this again.</li>
    <li> I was allergic to it. I&#x27;ve used the Hyaluronic acid straight before, and had no reaction, I have taken Resveratrol and take amino acids as a supplement without a problem. Not sure why this combination gave me a terrible rash. Maybe it is too potent. I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2cond bottle of this stuff and I think that I am seeing some results that I like. My eyes look better and the dryness in my face is better to. My favorite use is right after I use my microderma roller. I put it on after i roll to get the maximum results. I think I&#x27;ll keep using it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product smells and my skin seems to soak it up.  I&#x27;ve been using on my neck area for appx. 3 weeks and see a definite improvement in tone and firmness.  Will definitely order again.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Zero customer support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is quite good, but don&#x27;t even think about contacting the supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In two years and multiple attempts, The Skin Science refused to answer even a simple message - by email or telephone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there are many equivalent products available from other sellers.</li>
    <li> I work in the Aesthetic industry and am open to trying new products.  This is a keeper.  I would sell this product in my office.  Noticeable changes in my skin and I can honestly tell you that my skin is already in great condition.  I already have another order in my basket.</li>
    <li> The best part is the price for the quality of this product. It work okay, I recommend it for sure</li>
    <li> This is an overwelming product that helps skin, product lecture and information is totally true. I recomend it and I will buy it again and again. Thanks</li>
    <li> I think this may be helping some with the aging skin texture.  It has ingredients that I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use with my dermaroller but ended up using it every night! The compliments on my skin have really increased. it glides on, is quickly absorbed and you can literally feel the skin tighten and feel nourished. I use a sunscreen on top. I will alternate this in with my vitamin c, e ferrulic acid serum. I am SO happy with this product. I am a man age 45 who chose a year ago to look 35. I changed what i eat (clean program http://www.amazon.com/Clean----Expanded-Edition-Revolutionary/dp/0062201662/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1362044530&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;clean+program), changed supplements and have been  on a quest for skin care products that work and are a great value, this one is IT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month now, I can&#x27;t say I notice any real difference but I would like to give it more time. It does make my skin feel tighter, but I can&#x27;t say any of my lines have really filled in. Granted I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, I&#x27;m 34 but squinting, smiling etc has given me some wrinkles that I was hoping would fill in a bit more. Still going to give it more time and see</li>
