      <li>It is not strong but a hint of cherries, perfect.</li>
      <li>It is sweet and fruity, not too strong.  </li>
      <li>I just cannot believe I got it for such an amazing price!</li>
      <li>But totally worth every penny!</li>
      <li>smells very nice, fresh and fruity, perfect for young women, Long Lasting as well&lt;br /&gt;fast</li>
      <li>I love it so much I even  sprayed some in my car...</li>
      <li>It has a sweet smell and I can smell it throughout the day.</li>
      <li>In his charming way, he said the following, &amp;#34;You smell like a pineapple.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
      <li>It is light and fun.</li>
      <li>Most perfumes wear off by the end of the day no matter how much you spray on.  </li>
      <li>It has such a fresh and pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overly sweet and smells fresh and clean to me.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I was so tickled to get this large bottle at such a great price.</li>
      <li>It wears off relatively quickly, in 4-5 hours.</li>
      <li>It shipped quickly and arrived in time for Christmas as promised.</li>

      <li>love this scent, exactly what I was looking for, thanks AMAZON &amp;#60;3  </li>

      <li>My 19 year old daughter loves this and want more for this Christmas.</li>
      <li>Still a light and refreshing smell, but I don&#x27;t think this is the actual thing.</li>
      <li>I got mony money&#x27;s worth making the purchase through Amazon.</li>
      <li>You honestly don&#x27;t expect a 3.3 oz bottle to be so big!</li>
      <li>I do not like many perfumes because of similar notes, not this scent.  </li>
      <li>I really like this one!</li>
      <li>so you much buy on here!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is lovely and you get over 3 fluid ounces.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite fragrance- light, fruity, without being too sweet and fake smelling, and incredibly fresh!</li>
      <li>This scent is very nice, soft and long lasting.  </li>
      <li>Escada makes a beautiful scent that is very feminine, very subtle.  </li>
      <li>Scent is very subjective, so I hesitate to write a review on it.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was amazingly fast.  </li>
      <li>Once again thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
      <li>... but I can always count on Amazon to find someone who wants to sell whatever it might be.  </li>
      <li>My daughter really enjoys this cologne.</li>
      <li>and my wife absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>The one in stores actual smells crisp, fresh, and like cherries.</li>
      <li>Not worth the price that&#x27;s for sure.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Light fruity scent that is great for every day.</li>
    <li> My daughter really enjoys this cologne.</li>
    <li> I got a sample in my Sephora stuff... went back to buy it and it was gone.  They weren&#x27;t kidding when they said &amp;#34;for a limited time&amp;#34;... but I can always count on Amazon to find someone who wants to sell whatever it might be.  I like this fragrance.  It&#x27;s not overly sweet and smells fresh and clean to me.  Scent is very subjective, so I hesitate to write a review on it.  It works for me, but may not be for everyone.  I like a variety of scents, of which I pick the one that fits my mood for that day, week or month.  Clearly this will be a short lived choice as it will be gone soon from the market.</li>
    <li> I have loved every Escada perfume I have tried, and there have been many, and this one does not disappoint. I love it and so will you!</li>
    <li> Light, refreshing, pretty fragrance!  I tend to be very sensitive to smells, so I like a perfume that is not too overpowering.  Escada makes a beautiful scent that is very feminine, very subtle.  I really like this one!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite fragrance- light, fruity, without being too sweet and fake smelling, and incredibly fresh! The only downside I can find is that it is only available as a toilette and not perfume so it doesn&#x27;t last an incredibly long time- but it still stays with you all day, and I cannot tell you how many compliments I&#x27;ve received wearing this.</li>
    <li> Best scent of the Escada series! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to smell good. Or in my case, have a smiling wife!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and how subtle it becomes throughout the day. I received the bottle promptly and it was in fantastic condition. I just cannot believe I got it for such an amazing price!</li>
    <li> I just love this scent, got a sample and wanted to have a bottle, retail store claimed that it was seasonal so I checked Amazon and Viola there it was and super inexpensive, yep I bought it I&#x27;m so happy,it is such a girlie pretty scent</li>
    <li> smells very nice, fresh and fruity, perfect for young women, Long Lasting as well&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery, when you liked rockin Rio you like this one too</li>
    <li> Best price for this size HANDS DOWN.  And it&#x27;s a limited edition, so get it now because it&#x27;s leaving store shelves already.</li>
    <li> love this scent, exactly what I was looking for, thanks AMAZON &amp;#60;3  Beautiful scent, thanks you very much, I won&#x27;t be sharing this :)</li>
    <li> This scent is very nice, soft and long lasting.  I do not like many perfumes because of similar notes, not this scent.  I recommend!</li>
    <li> Cherry in The Air is a beautiful fragrance.  Although it is perfect for summer I simply cannot resist wearing it now!  It reminds me a bit of Bath and Body Works fragrances but it is much more lush!  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  I only wish there was a shower gel and lotion to go with it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume. I was afraid the scent would be either too sweet but it is fruity while not being overpowering. It is a little pricey but as long as it takes me to use a perfume up, it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
    <li> After 32 years of marriage it was time to shift gears and find a new perfume!  It was a breath of freshness that my husband found very satisfying!</li>
    <li> A very good gift to give to your girlfriend mine was very happy!!!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for someone so I can&#x27;t attest to the scent, but she loved it so if this is a fragrance you know and like, this is a good size product for the price. It shipped quickly and arrived in time for Christmas as promised.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is sooooo fabulous!  Subtle, but clearly cherries....not over-powering, and so fresh.  It is available for &#x27;a limited time,&#x27; and all I can hope is that its popularity keeps it around longer.  I suggest everyone picks-up a bottle while they can.  You won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect.  It came to the house quickly, it was well packaged, it was an amazing price and my wife absolutely loves it.  Thank you so much for everything!!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Amazing perfect for summer . A sweet an juicy cherry scent and it limited edition so you much buy on here! But totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love it. And had excellent shopping experience</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. It has a sweet smell and I can smell it throughout the day. The price was decent as well.</li>
    <li> Sweet &amp; Sexy for the summer... Love Escada!!!</li>
    <li> noone noticed any difference. Maybe its not good for my chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it on someone else. Not for me.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing perfume. It smells so nice. It has such a fresh and pleasant scent. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I got a sample in the mail and loved it and my boyfriend gave it to me for Valentines day. It smells great for about 5 minutes then seems to disappear completely. I have to keep reapplying it which leads me to believe it is not a very good quality. I think Escada took some shortcuts somewhere along the creation of this line and my excitement has turned to dismay! Not worth the price that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It smells absolutely wonderful.  Most perfumes wear off by the end of the day no matter how much you spray on.  However, just using a little lasts all day.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this ever - it always seems to happen to me when I find a perfume I love.</li>
    <li> Love the scent!!! Yummy. It is not strong but a hint of cherries, perfect. This has become my favorite cologne. It is not over powering.</li>
    <li> Very quick service and a great price! I will always order from them! Very limited edition and they had it!</li>
    <li> Love it smells so good fresh and fruity I get so many compliments on this fragrance not to overwhelming on the scent either</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but the scent does not last long and after smelling it in stores I don&#x27;t feel like this is the actual scent. It smells a bit off. The one in stores actual smells crisp, fresh, and like cherries. This one has not even the day I opened it. Still a light and refreshing smell, but I don&#x27;t think this is the actual thing.</li>
    <li> Although I love the smell of this perfume, I am totally disappointed with the pricing. That last purchase I made was January 2014. I paid $55.70 for 3.3 oz. When I went to order today, the l lowest price for the same exact item was over $104.00. which is ridiculous!  I wont be purchasing from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I got mony money&#x27;s worth making the purchase through Amazon. The fragrance is lovely and you get over 3 fluid ounces.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  I am a fan of Escada and always loved Rockin&#x27; Rio.  I purchased the purchase spray size of this at Sephora and fell in love with it and had to buy the full-size here.  It is sweet and fruity, not too strong.  Now of my all time favorites and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a great bottle, i love the light sweet scent. Used everyday, light enough to be used as a body spray. Scent is not long lasting.</li>
    <li> You honestly don&#x27;t expect a 3.3 oz bottle to be so big! But it is!&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, its strong at first, but it lasts for a long long time--very fruity and candy like (if you like that sort of thing)&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> I do like it. It reminds me of cherry blossoms. It is light and fun. It wears off relatively quickly, in 4-5 hours. Personally, I prefer that. I would not like to smell like a perfume counter at a department store all day. In addition, I am very sensitive to smells, and this perfume does not result in a headache or heart pulpitations.&lt;br /&gt;I would say it smells of cherry and vanilla, but it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly sweet. It is appropriate to wear any time of day.&lt;br /&gt;I asked my amazing husband to give me some input on the notes. In his charming way, he said the following, &amp;#34;You smell like a pineapple.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you go, ladies, if you like smelling like cherry-vanilla or even a pineapple, this perfume will make you happy!</li>
    <li> Too frutie for me, I will not buy again. I can deal with it now, but it does not have the gentle , soft smell I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this perfume very clean.  Shipping was amazingly fast.  Will buy from and recommend you to my friends.  Once again thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
    <li> Ths smells like candy.  Does not last either.  I was disappointed, not cheap.  I ended up giving to the teen next door</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and safely packaged. Smells great - air of cherry blossoms. Lasts about 5 hours; a bit longer would be nice.</li>
    <li> My 19 year old daughter loves this and want more for this Christmas.</li>
    <li> I have to say I adore this perfume!!! I love it so much I even  sprayed some in my car...lol!!! This frangrance is very light which I like. I receive compliments often when wearing this. My only thing is that is doesnt last a long time (Or least I don&#x27;t think). But that doesnt stop me from purchasing this again in the future. 5 stars!!! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance &amp; I was so tickled to get this large bottle at such a great price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> use sparingly and carry with you...goes on very strong but then fades fairly quickly. over all a great scent. cute bottle</li>
</ol>
