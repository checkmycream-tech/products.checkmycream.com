<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used eye liner for a lot of years.  When I read the reviews, I thought this might be the answer to constantly having to reapply.  This product is not any better to what I have been using.  I do not even have to use eye makeup remover as it comes off so easily.  I will keep looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but I was so very impressed with this seller and product that I felt I needed to this time around. The first time I ordered this product I got a dud, but the seller was amazing to work with on getting a replacement. 5 Stars for the Seller! The Eyeliner is a matte black that applies very easily. However, you will need to work quick as when it dries there is no fixing with out using make up remover. I have found it doesn&#x27;t budge, even when I still have it on in the shower, and that it needs an oil based remover.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is is I really wish it had a brush applicator instead of the felt one. It&#x27;s kinda knit picky, but I prefer a brush applicator though I don&#x27;t mind the felt applicator when wearing with flash eyelashes. I would definitely purchase this product again and has the potential to be come an HG product!</li>
    <li> The Liquid 1 sec is so nice and the best eye liner I have ever got. I decided to let my daughter try it with me and she said the exact same thing I have said and thought.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to apply and takes only one applicant to make it through the whole day. The tip is very nice also, just the right shape to apply with. I have never had so much luck with a eye liner before and not having to reapply. I have bought all kinds of eye liner in the past and I have NEVER liked it this much!!! The color is black and it is a really nice black,it&#x27;s not a dull black.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problems with any type of irritation to my eyes or anything. I&#x27;m hooked on it and use it every day and so does my daughter,so I am thinking she needs to get her own:)&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this eye liner!!! In stores for this type of eye liner you would be paying more than you are for this and I personally think the price for this is perfect!! I don&#x27;t think we will ever buy any other brand again!!&lt;br /&gt;I received this at little to no cost to give my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I have tried more than a hundred &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; eyeliners because I have hooded and oily lids. This is by far the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve used. The first thing I did was wear it overnight to see how it stands up while I&#x27;m sleeping. (Admit it, sometimes we are lazy and don&#x27;t feel like removing our makeup.) I woke up and there were no smudges and no flaking. All other eyeliners did both. You could literally walk out of the house looking like you just applied it. I use a primer as well so this may help with staying power. Compared to high end waterproof eyeliners, it&#x27;s much cheaper and has amazing results. The brush is firm and makes application easy. If you&#x27;re a first time user, practice makes perfect so don&#x27;t give up. So grateful I finally found something that eliminates the worry of raccoon eyes by mid day.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner isn&#x27;t liquid or pencil.. its more like a marker. super precise, love it! also, doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
    <li> Eyeliner liquid formula is great in this product! The eyeliner is waterproof and does stay on as described. But the applicator needs work. The liquid did not evenly absorb in the felt tip causing un even distribution of the product. It may have been a faulty felt tip. Even though I stored it pen tip down and cap tightly closed as directed, the liquid seemed to dry on the tip. I returned the item because I couldn&#x27;t use it.If the applicator was a thin brush it probably would work a whole lot better.</li>
    <li> I am positive I have the oiliest eyelids in the world so when I bought this I figured - ehhh - it won&#x27;t last either.  I was deeply surprised and pleased to find that it lasted all day - yes, alllllll day!  I will admit I found it a bit tricky to put on - a steady hand is a must.  I keep my eye-makeup remover bottle close by with a q-tip and use that when I make mistakes and somehow draw the line jagged or something.  I&#x27;m catching on though and the mistakes are getting fewer and fewer.  I wear it both on the upper lid and the lower lid.  On the lower lid I make a very thin line right below the lashes (I mean, right below - not a smidgen further down) and by the time I&#x27;m ready for bed, the line is still there - not quite as solid but definitely there.  The upper lid by evening is still looking like I just put it on.  There is no flaking, no peeling, no smudging, no raccoon eyes, nothing.  You will love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused as to why this has so many great reviews. I bought this &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; eyeliner so I could avoid raccoon eyes at the gym. It did worse than my regular non-waterproof eyeliner. Not only did it smear when I got a little sweaty, but it became sticky and my eyelids felt awful. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a fan of liquid eyeliners but this is definitely one that I like!!! The flexible brush tip makes applying so much easier and it does really just glide on. I love that you can have a thin line or with a little bit a pressure something more dramatic. It lasted all day and didn&#x27;t smudge at all (amazing!) I removed it with makeup remover, as I do all my waterproof makeup. Best liquid liner I&#x27;ve ever found. I received this in exchange for an honest review and I actually love it enough I just ordered another!</li>
    <li> Despite all the fantastic reviews of this eyeliner, I hated it. Maybe I got a lemon but what I received was a dried out pen that applied sort of sticky/tacky. You can&#x27;t go over even the slightest edge of a previously drawn line without the pen sticking completely. I should&#x27;ve just sprung the extra couple bucks for the Stilla liner instead.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is great. It goes on easily and stays all day.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! This is very easy to apply since the tip has enough firmness not to cause a wobbly looking line. It lasts a long time as well. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> It goes on easily.  Seems to last.  However, the second time I took the cap off to use it, the tip fell out into the sink.  Not a biggie, I picked it up and put it back, but every time I go to use it the same thing happens. A definite quality control issue.  I will continue to use it, but that is a lot of ink loss in the long run (on my fingers from picking it up and pushing it back into the pen).  I probably will go back to my Stila which has lasted me over 6 months with no problems.</li>
    <li> My dry out really fast. I only used it for couple time, then it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I was worried to buy this due to most of the reviewers had gotten the product free for giving the product a review.  I am SO happy that I decided to buy this eyeliner.  I have tried so many different brands and types of eyeliner and had yet to find one that wouldn&#x27;t end up in the creases of my eye.  By far the best eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I usually have the worst luck with eyeliner pens like this. They usually go on super thick and smear all over your eyelid and it&#x27;s just a huge mess. This product does the exact opposite. I feel like a pro when I apply my eyeliner now! I still can&#x27;t do cat eye look but I&#x27;m trying to learn and I know this product will help make learning it a lot less frustrating and less messy! This is also a great price! Will repurchase!</li>
    <li> I was somewhat apprehensive at first due to the cautions on applying quickly, but after you get the hang of it, this is the most wonderful product!  It truly does stay on longer than any liner I have every tried.  The only downside is the 2 month usage period.</li>
    <li> This is a great liquid eye liner. You can change the thickness of the line easily and it dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t smudge, run or flake. Still looks great at the end of a long day.</li>
    <li> Please see below for details regarding review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS for the glide of how it goes on... I really did like the product.&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS for  customer service (which is extremely important to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 STARS for it being defective - Quite a few times when I popped the cap to open the pen, the tip would come off inside the cap and I found myself messing with it way to much... so even tough I liked it, I returned it because I didn&#x27;t have the time or the energy to keep fixing it, and having the black ink getting on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: My pen might have just had a defect, so I would definitely give the product a try if I were you. In the end it works well when using it, glides on smooth. and lasts pretty good.</li>
    <li> Wish there was a way to leave a review with less than one star!  This product was horrible.  I have been using covergirl&#x27;s blendable eye liner pencil for YEARS.  I just light the end with a lighter for a split second and it glides on smooth like liquid and stays on very well.  Every once in a while I&#x27;ll see a good review on a liquid eyeliner and give it a try, because the two things I don&#x27;t like about my pencil is that I have to resharpen it every time I use it to get a good line, and it still is not as thin and precise as I would like.  This eyeliner is very dry and weak making it hard to put on.  It takes me twice as long because I have to go over it a few times to get it to show up good.  When my eye watered in the corner, the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; eyeliner came right off.  It would not even go on my inside bottom waterline at all!  Maybe I just got a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; but just beware if you order this.</li>
    <li> Easy trans, quick delivery.  excellent eyeliner.  Will purchase again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:be62ab137ea3059ef0d1ce6dc12bf8c0]]I had never heard of this brand, until I recently tried it out. However, I am glad that I did. It is a really well-made eyeliner. I have probably hundreds of eyeliners. So when it comes to eyeliner I am really particular, and know them well. As seen in the pictures of before and after using the eyeliner, I like to wear my eyeliner on the bottom. It work&#x27;s both great ways though.    It&#x27;s not only easy to apply, but dries quickly as well. It&#x27;s hard to rub off, but easy to wipe off with makeup remover. I haven&#x27;t had any clumping with the eyeliner nor does it fade. I love the pointed tip as it is hard enough to put the eyeliner on so it doesn&#x27;t go everywhere, but soft enough so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to put on.    If I had to compare it to an eyeliner, it is similar to that of Jesse&#x27;s Girl liquid eyeliner pen. I like that I don&#x27;t have to make skinny-mini lines if I don&#x27;t want to. It does both skinny as well as thick lines with ease. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the eyeliner, and can&#x27;t find anything I dislike about it. I think the quality of it is high, and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a precise pen eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST eyeliner that I have EVER used!  It goes on smoothly and quickly AND STAYS on until I am ready to clean my face at night.  GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT SELLER!!!!!!  Thanks for offering it!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS EYE LINER EASY TO USE. GOES ON VERY SMOOTHLY AND LOOKS GREAT. VERY EASY TO APPLY. I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of felt tip eyeliner pencils so I was happy to test this out and give my opinion on it. They give me the look that I want to achieve. And this liquid liner was no different. I applied it and let it set (which didn&#x27;t take long at all) I did the old rub test, and nothing. Nothing came off. I was able to get good wear out of it, yet when I wanted it to come off it came off with my favorite makeup remover. I love this.</li>
    <li> Have never been able to find a liner that lasts all day but this is the closest one so far.  Easy to apply with thin/sharp point.</li>
    <li> I hate to say I&#x27;m not all that impressed. Product was messy and didnt flow out of the tip at a consistent pace. Sometimes it was overly saturated and other times dry. As far as the wear this didnt stay looking good all day like it says it will. It smeared and was frustrating to work with. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> What a lovely pen style waterproof eye liner.  I am not a person who wears a lot of makeup.  My eyes run all the time.  So being truly waterproof is really important to me.  I have tested it over 24 hrs and it was waterproof.  It is so easy to apply.  Just like drawing a line.  My eyelids are very heavy and you don&#x27;t see much of my eye.  This really does accent my eyes.  I like that I can apply it and tinted moisturizer and go out.  I also like it&#x27;s good for 2-3 months after opening and if it dries up just apply a couple drops of water.  I did receive this product to review and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Not phenomenal it works but not for the price. Not worth it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so great, but the brush dries out so quickly I can only finish one eye!</li>
    <li> Great price, and goes on even bolder than its more expensive counterparts!!</li>
    <li> I was extremely exited to try this, because from the reviews it seems like it was the perfect eyeliner. However, it&#x27;s not black enough for me. I don&#x27;t know if I got a &amp;#34;dud,&amp;#34; but the ink isn&#x27;t vivid, and it seems like it applies better while testing it on my hand then it does on my actual eye. I am going to  order another one, just to see if maybe I got a random/ bad quality product. After I order another, I will review again. If it is the same quality as the first product I received, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have black hair/ black eyes, and want a black eyeliner.</li>
    <li> The felt tip fell off after 1 use and the liquid spilled out. The first use was amazing but the  It just broke before I got to use it again. I stored it the same way I do all my makeup, this has never happened with any felt tip eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Ouwh!! Stays put and a DARK deep black, applies easily and doesn&#x27;t smudge this ones a keeper! The company sent me an email to remember to review and if not 100% satisfied to contact them so don&#x27;t be worried about getting a dud they seem willing to make it right!</li>
    <li> i have a chronic watery eye and my eye liner always runs, i bought this for a cruise i am taking so i can be in the water and not worry.  I tried it in advance to see if it looks ok (not cakey or chips off) and i am super excited that my watery eye doesn&#x27;t budge this liner. SO happy about that. GREAT product will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> This is by far the poorest eyeliner I have ever used. It never went on evenly and always left gaps. I tried storing it upside down on my counter to help it work better but it didn&#x27;t help in the least. 👎</li>
    <li> Ok ladies listen to me.... I have tried about 8 to 10 different kinds of liquid eyeliners! I hesitated to spend this much on liquid eyeliner but ladies worth every cent ! Dries super fast and staying power AMAZing!!!!!! Will only use this from this day forward !!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect and works just as described! I was nervous at first since it&#x27;s my first liquid eyeliner, but even with shaky hands if you start on the outer corner of the cat-eye/wing (if you&#x27;re doing cat-eye/wing) it works really well and is super precise.  It dries really fast though, so be sure to have good makeup wipes to correct any mistakes because this is very very waterproof and stays all day (actually stays all day and may be even slightly difficult to remove if you&#x27;re not used to removing waterproof makeup).</li>
    <li> I was about to give this 2-3 stars because, while the eyeliner was good while it lasted, it dried out. But then I read in the product description that, if it does dry out before 3 months, to dip it in some water and it will be as good as new. I was kind of skeptical, but I did it, and, lo-and-behold, it&#x27;s working nicely again!</li>
    <li> Really is waterproof, lasts all day even when I play sports!  Also goes on smooth! A little pricey but i guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry all the way but if I apply black eyeshadow over it stays.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner, stays all day.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner. Perfect tip. I&#x27;m not expert on eyeliner a</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is not as black as I had wanted to be but it really does stay on 24/7!</li>
    <li> Cost too much - can get comparible for le$$</li>
    <li> The Divinnas’ liner is opaque, long lasting, fast drying, and does not move after application. The tip of the brush is stiff but flexible enough to allow trouble-free daily use for all styles of liner. If you wear the liner and get your face wet, it does not smudge or move so it is waterproof in that sense. However, if your face is wet and you touch the liner then it does smudge and can come off easily. Therefore, I would rather use the word “water resistant” than waterproof. When I used this liner, it was easy for me to get a crisp thin line, which I have found to be difficult sometimes when I have tried other felt tip pens. In addition, it was not difficult to thicken the liner to my preferred width. Using any oil, for example mineral oil, or makeup remover wipe takes this liner off without any hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent this liner complimentary for review purposes and this does not influence my opinion*</li>
    <li> I REALLY REALLY love this product, it works amazingly, BUT the only downside is that the tip got clogged. I kept it clean as much as possible, I suppose with any eyeliner that is inevitable just because it&#x27;s the tip that&#x27;s touching the eye lid. Make up and oils get stuck in it, either way, I love this product regardless of the tip getting clogged.</li>
    <li> appeared to be dry out and didn&#x27;t work well</li>
    <li> Only used it once (this morning) but just checked my makeup and it still looks perfect! It went on very easily. Super satisfied!</li>
    <li> too expensive but works fantastically! dries super fast</li>
    <li> Excellent product....I really love it! When you apply, Your eyes look extremely different with any color.I will recommend this product to anyone.It is very easy and precise to apply it and long lasting the best eyeliner ever! I recieved a discounted item for product testing.</li>
    <li> This is horrible!  Don&#x27;t buy!  I was expecting this to go on dark and last all day but I can&#x27;t even get it show up.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> Definitely the better of the liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve purchased. I&#x27;d definitely purchase this item again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eye liner it goes on so smooth and makes awesome cat eyes!!</li>
    <li> I like this waterproof liquid eyeliner, though it takes a steady hand to apply it well. I rest my elbow on my vanity to help stay steady. It comes in a pen like container--a feature I like in a liquid eyeliner because I find it easier to apply. The black color is classic. Since I received this for review, I wanted to test the waterproof qualities before reviewing. Here are my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this eyeliner in the morning along with a waterproof mascara, after it dried I splashed my face several times. The eyeliner was not effected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wrote a line on my hand and let it dry. I ran running water on my and and the line did not budge. I rubbed on it lightly and still no noticeable smearing. Then I put a little coconut oil (my preferred makeup remover) on my finger and rubbed it into the line and used a washcloth to remove it. It removed easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After testing my hand, I did my morning workout then played a round of golf outside. Neither of those effected the eyeliner and it is stayed intact into the evening. I am pleased with the wearing power--though I suspect it might smear if wet and rubbed (I could be wrong, but based on how easily it was removed with the coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will reach for this for nights out dancing or any other time I want a made up look that is long-lasting.</li>
    <li> Liquid eyeliners are a new thing for me, as I&#x27;ve always found myself drawn to the gel pencils. After becoming a bit obsessed with looks that feature winged liner, I knew I would have to learn to master liquid liner. I&#x27;ve tried a few different ones, but this liquid liner has become my favorite. The tip shape makes it easy to use and I love that it dries so quickly. One of my biggest issues with liquid liner has been smudging, which I do not experience with this. I only wear it along my top lash line, but have had no issues with flaking or smudging. I also really love that this liner is cruelty free and does not contain parabens. *Product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> This product works really well, especially for the price. Very black, applies smoothly, stays on like it says, this will certainly be a part of my makeup essentials.</li>
    <li> The product works very well. I ordered this eyeliner in black and the color is very opaque which was what i was looking for. It also dries very quickly which was nice. However, I am rating 4 stars because after a bit of long-term use (every day approx. 5 days a week) the nub started to deteriorate a bit which I guess is a thing with these kinds of eyeliner tips since I&#x27;ve had other eyeliners do the same thing. Once it starts to get &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34;, it becomes harder to apply. However, it works very well in the beginning and is easy to apply,and being relatively inexpensive is definitely a plus. Once it starts to deteriorate it becomes more difficult to make less of a mess (my hand isn&#x27;t very steady either) but all in all, this was a great buy and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best liner so far that is water proof, but I do have to apply it a couple of times as it may come off a bit..</li>
    <li> The product is great despite the nasty email i received from the seller this is actually a great product.  I did not like liquid eyeliner because its just too messy but this product changed my mind regarding liquid eyeliners.</li>
    <li> I really fell in love with this eyeliner from the moment I first used it. I have oily eyelids and finding and eyeliner that stays on is very hard and this one stayed on all day. It is extremely easy to apply, I was able to get an even winged eyeliner in record time. I have been doing my makeup for years and perfect eyeliner has been impossible until now this is the fastest and easiest eyeliner I have ever used. Over the years I have used eyeliners that range in price and type from liquid to pencil to gel and I believe this is the best for beginners and anybody who wants even eyeliner. This eyeliner can create thin lines for subtle looks or thick for a more dramatic effect. I am very happy with the quality and the darkness of the pigmentation. It will stay on all day and wont irritate my eyes like other eyeliners I have owned in the past. I want to mention that i received this product free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions.</li>
    <li> Easy application, nice lines.</li>
    <li> This quick drying liquid eyeliner is AMAZING! I have never seen a liquid eyeliner dry so fast, or go on as nicely as this one. I feel like I can now accurately put on my eyeliner like I want it to be. Before, I always ended up looking silly because the liquid eyeliner I had would smudge, or go on wrong. I am so pleased that I was given the opportunity to test this eyeliner complimentary, and share my experiences and feedback. This eyeliner goes on evenly, and the amount of pressure you apply will vary the results in how thick your eyeliner will look. It drys evenly, and has caused me no irritation. I like that it&#x27;s like a pen. Most liquid eyeliners you have a top that comes out of the bottle, and I think it dries up in the bottle quicker that way. I can&#x27;t say enough how wonderful this liquid eyeliner is. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> This is the worst eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. It might be a good product if the tip didn&#x27;t constantly come out causing me to get my fingers all black putting back into place probably every other use. Poorly manufactured and not worth it. I&#x27;d rather pay Stila prices for something  that doesn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the easiest to apply. It had a sticky feel to it. I prefer the Physicians Formula Eye Booster 2-in-1 Lash Boosting Eyeliner + Serum, Ultra Black, 0.016 Ounce (Health and Beauty).</li>
    <li> It was okay would not buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner! It looks good all day long!</li>
    <li> Worst eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;It was a humid day in DC and I was sweating black, it looked like a cried for hours.&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything and got worst. I even had to go to the CVS to buy make up remover wipes to look &amp;#34;decent&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I have danced all my life. I always go for a waterproof eyeliner and I wanted to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;A simply 15 minute walk during the Summer made my eyes look terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Warm regards    Rosa Matic</li>
    <li> I have never been more disappointed in a make up product . First, the liner is very transparent or thin. It looks more like the point your eyes need reapplication that a first application. Second, it might be the applicator. When you push it along a tissue against a hard surface the liner is black. If you could only push that hard against your eyelid you would get the intended result... but then who would do that?  So don&#x27;t waster your money unless you are looking for a transparent need more eye liner look.</li>
    <li> The product was very dry and did not leave much color even after I dipped the tip in water.  I was not pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type of person who likes to apply eyeliner everyday one of the reasons is that I&#x27;m not so good at applying eyeliner and the second one is that I&#x27;m I usually in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to apply it but after I tried this eyeliner I started using it frequently and that&#x27;s because this eyeliner is very easy to use it deposits the right amount of color with the slightest pressure and the brush is so precise that I&#x27;m able to apply the eyeliner in a short amount of time. The eyeliner does dry up really fast and it lasts all day it&#x27;s definitely a good quality eyeliner and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start using eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews and I&#x27;m here to tell you this product is so good I got my lazy butt on here to write one! My skin is incredibly sensitive and breaks out no matter what I do. I struggled with acne since I was 11 years old, I&#x27;m 22 now. After 11 years I found the best and most affordable skin care wash system and this is it!! I&#x27;ve never had smoother skin so fast! Proactive didn&#x27;t even come close to achieving the same results. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive combination skin like myself.</li>
    <li> Stays on the best of any eyeliner I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It stays put until I get ready to remove it. Definitely will reorder.</li>
    <li> It dried up within 2 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;do not waste your money</li>
    <li> What a wonderful eye liner ,this product arrived just as described . This product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly , it arrived in excellent condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a liquid 1 second quick dry 24/7 day wear automatic precise pen waterproof eyeliner by Nikka Notto cosmetics.This product is a long lasting, stays all day 24/7. Take a long overseas business flight and arrive to destination beautiful and with perfect eye makeup. If used with a makeup base and/or eyeshadow will last more than 24h.  So it&#x27;s great for wild night parties after work, or an emergency overnight stay out of town. It is smudge free and doesn&#x27;t run on wrinkles.It is super quick drying within 3 seconds after application, it deposits the right amount of color, with the slightest pressure being the most precise eyeliner on the market. The application is fast and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I positively love this product , it works amazingly .I have never had a eyeliner work this great , it is so easy to apply and lasts over 24 hours . It is an intense dark black which looks amazing on.I have always had a difficult time putting eyeliner on but with this one it just glides on , just the perfect amount comes out.If you are looking for a product like this for yourself or as a gift look no further you have found it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product .</li>
    <li> I was disappointed!  Despite all of the positive reviews, I found it difficult to use.  It went on fairly smoothly, but if you mess up, it&#x27;s there to stay.  You need make-up remover to get this stuff off.  Also, it didn&#x27;t last very long.  I only used it for approximately 2 weeks before it dried up.  I used it daily - however, I generally get 2 months of use out of an eyeliner before I need to purchase again.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Broke the second I opened it. Now I have to pay to ship it back to get another to replace it which means I&#x27;ll pay double for one eyeliner. Terrible</li>
    <li> I bought this product, after couple of days of using it, the tip went dry. And its not smudge free.</li>
    <li> Good eyeliner for when your have a day with very little makeup. But for dramatic eyes I tend to reach for something different.</li>
    <li> This product made my eye lids itch, itch, itch. I just wound up always scratching the eyeliner off. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I really do like this eyeliner!  I needed a waterproof eyeliner to line my upper waterline that wouldn&#x27;t smudge or smear.  It is super easy to apply and dries quickly, so there isn&#x27;t time for it to run.  If I make a mistake, I use a Q-tip &amp; oil free make up remover and it comes off nicely.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it continues to work well.  I store it as recommended (tip down) and have had no issues with it drying out.  I occasionally throw it in a makeup bag and have had no issues with it leaking or drying out.  If this continues, I will certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner, lasts all day. Love it</li>
    <li> Update on my review going from 5 stars to 1. Works for a little while only. This item was ordered 1 month ago and already is drying out. - Quick dry indeed so never again. Stila brand lasts me 6 months because that was the last time I ordered Stila. Stila might be 6 bucks more but at least its worth it because it can last months and months. Also BH Cosmetics waterproof or regular lasts up to 6 months as well.</li>
    <li> It dries fast leaving little room for error.  Lasts all day...I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Goes on very smoothly and and easily.</li>
    <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is I have problems with it staying on my bottom eye lid.  Any ideas on how to keep it from wearing off?  The top eye lid is GREAT!!  Because I am older, I have had a problem with it smearing when applied to upper lid. Not with this product!!  It stays put all day. A good buy.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just got an old tube of this, but it seemed quite dry to me and for that reason was difficult to apply and didn&#x27;t show up well.  I tried using it for a number of applications, but it just didn&#x27;t work.  For me, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> such good reviews and yet it smudges on me in an hour since I have tiny, oily eyelids (asian). it also flakes all over the place and i look like a very tiny person did modern art on my eyes. it comes off easily with face wash however. I will keep and only draw a very fine line. on with the hunt.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a couple of uses but the felt quickly dried out and started fraying making it hard to draw a straight line.  After the first month the tip was so dried out that I had to discard it.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected and quite pleased with product.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> My wife really love to put make up, and when i got this Liquid eyeliner she automatically test it, and she said she love it since its a waterproof , long lasting and she love the fineness . And for sure will get this product again, well i only get this for free in exchange on my review and for sure my wife will  get another one in the future</li>
    <li> Truly a great eyeliner.. surprised.. I love it!</li>
    <li> Pen was totally dried out when I received it. Shook it vigorously and stored it upside down according to instructions. Didn&#x27;t make a difference. Ripoff.</li>
    <li> Does not make a very dark line to begin with, then quickly fades and smudges.  The applicator tip seemed a bit dry after only a few uses. Quite disappointed. Purchased because of all the good reviews, so thought I might possibly save someone from making the same expensive mistake by posting my experience with the product. (Note: One star for being paraben-free)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not w huge fan of liquid eyeliner for a reason that it always leave a mess and I am always in a hurry. But I fell in love with this one.. When I first opened it I was frustrated coz it leave a mess on my hand but to my surprise it was already dry when I touched it. It seems like it dries super fast the moment you put it on.. Then I immediately tried it on my eyes and whoa I am really impressed.. I&#x27;m not really good in using liquid eyeliner but this one is superb, I haven&#x27;t made any mess at all.  easy to put on , easy to clean and dries super fast..</li>
    <li> Received this eyeliner, used it 3 times, and I would always get it all over my hands.  I thought it was just me being messy, but this morning I took a good look at it after removing the cap, and it is leaking!  Not from the applicator tip, but it actually dripped on me.  I like the eyeliner though, and have requested a replacement.</li>
    <li> this eyeliner is very hard to apply, making the line way to thick and almost impossible to shape. I would not suggest anyone to purchase this, since there are other eyeliners that are easier to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this liquid eyeliner. It does dry very quickly and holds up great all day. Very easy to apply with the felt tip, and color is deeply pigmented. One stroke is all you need. It did seem to rub off on my upper lid fold after a while. I wear primer but it still seems to rub. Might experiment with different primers, love the size and ease of use.</li>
    <li> A little awkward to apply.....maybe my eye area is moist, but this product, even after being shaken gently, was slightly clumpy and runny on the waterline. It did not create the thick smooth line I was looking for. Went back to my Stila waterproof liner.</li>
    <li> i have tried so many eyeliners and have finally found one that last long, doesn&#x27;t transfer to the upper kid and dries fast. Love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a top quality liquid eyeliner. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use. It also lasts until you&#x27;re ready for it to come off. I applied it, and gave it the ultimate test, I jumped into the swimming pool! No smudging, or anything resulted from that adventure either. The brush tip is flexible too, so it makes it easier to create the look you want too. I highly recommend this liquid eyeliner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. All expressed opinions are mine, and are derived from the testing of the actual product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time to try Nikka Notto eyeliner, and I wonder how it will works to me, coz I&#x27;ve read alot of good reviews on it so I decided to order it right away... I&#x27;m so excited to try it within that day. I received it with good packaging so I opened it and tried it right away I&#x27;m so impressed cuz it has soft, fine and thin brush and it&#x27;s very easy to use.. I feel like a pro with this eyeliner..... I highly recommend this product to everyone...</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to sample this product in return for my feedback.  This eyeliner is quick drying and long lasting as advertised.  My favorite part about this product is the applicator tip.  It is fairly firm and makes for easy and fool proof application. My eyes really popped with this product.  The only downside to this product for me is that it is almost too long lasting. It took a little bit more washing and rubbing to remove this product when I was done.  It was also just a touch dark for me, that really isnt a drawback for the product, I am just fairly complected. Overall, this is a fun product and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner has a bunch of rave reviews, and I&#x27;m not sure why. It&#x27;s not a breakthrough product.  It advertises long wear and water proof, but it isn&#x27;t sweat proof.  I put this stuff on and an hour later it&#x27;s messed up.  I&#x27;ve used better eyeliner.  Plus I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s cruelty free, I didn&#x27;t see any indication that it is on the box.    [WARNING]I edited this review because I was threatened with legal action for the original review.</li>
    <li> This is my second time trying out Eyeliner in pen form. This eye-liner has to be the quickest drying eye-liner I&#x27;ve ever applied! I found it was extremely easy to apply and is definitely waterproof! If your looking for a long lasting eye-opening eye-liner, this is your product. I find its much easier to dress up your eyes with this smooth gliding pen. I&#x27;m hoping to see this [[ASIN:B00KW8LIA6 Liquid 1 Sec. Quick Dry 24/7 Day Wear Automatic Precise Pen Waterproof Eyeliner by Nikka Notto]] in more color options in the future, I will be buying more and recommending to all my friends!</li>
    <li> This liner does have amazing staying power. It works fairly well on the wanter line of the eye and fades there instead of running or smudging. It does dry quickly. I gave this product a 3 star rating for the applicator tip. It is stiff and the application can be sporadic if you are not using it inverted. Even then I frequently had a section of the line that did not cover. I tried many different positions and found this to be the case on multiple occasions. This makes applying a thick cat eye line challenging. If I could have the staying power and beautiful black of this eye liner in the Stilla applicator pen it would be a complete win!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite cover the waterline as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  Guess I&#x27;ll stick with my pencil for that, but the lash lines look really clean.  It also rubs off easily, even 30 minutes after application.</li>
    <li> Horrible. When I got the product it was already dry so I got it replaced. The new one I received dried out within weeks. A complete waste of money. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Impressive liner but a little expensive</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sucks.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how there are so many positive reviews. I am a makeup artist and I can tell you that there is nothing special or convenient about this pen. Maybe it is waterproof?&lt;br /&gt;The pen does not release the pigment in a quick or even method. So you will need to correct for uneven application. It pulls up and sticks to itself if you need to go over any previous application which you will have to do. In order to get the deep black color that it claims to deliver you will need to do several applications, again, problematic. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Really is long lasting! Store tip down for longer lasting fluid.</li>
    <li> Neat little eyeliner.. it reminds me of fingernail polish but if you made it in eyeliner form :P it wipes right on and dries really quickly. it has a really fine point on it, so as long as you dont push hard, you can make pretty, thin lines unlike when I use a regular pencil liner. It comes in a cute, trendy box and plenty of instructions. I think this is better than any of the name brand liners I have used so far and I would definitely recommend this eye liner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> I really like this quick dry intense black precise pen waterproof pen. I received mine very fast with shipping, and I really like the packaging it looks very cute. I have tried a lot  of  drugstore namebrand waterproof eyeliners, so I can compare how this works. I love this one it works really great for me for  a number of reasons compared to using drugstore brands. Well for one, it has a very nice tip for a nice precise line.  I was able to make a nice cat eye on my eyelids and it looked great. The application went smoothly and I was able to build on it if needed.Other waterproof eyeliner pens I had trouble making a straight line with it and for some reason this went on smoohtly nice and precise. It does not add a whole glob of product either when you use it. It is waterproof as I tested that feature out. The only con I had with this is that it did not dry in 3 seconds, not sure if it was due to making it more bolder by adding more to it. But it did however dry within seconds not like my other pens if I dare touch it it would smear. Then I would  get frustrated and have to clean it up and  start all over again. This one worked very well, very impressed at how easy it was for me to use. I definitely recommend you trying it out you won&#x27;t be disappointed.You also do not have to shake the crap out of this one like other pens I have used. Just store the point down when done and when you are ready to use again it dispenses the right amount of product  you need. Love it soo far!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great eyeliner. It was surprisingly easy to use. I usually have some problems with liquid eyeliners but I didn&#x27;t with this one. I love how easy it is for me to get thin or thick lines. This eyeliner comes in a nice little box so it&#x27;s easy to give as gift to someone else, as well. I was so excited to get to try this eyeliner through a promotion. It glides on very easy and stayed on all day. I don&#x27;t know about it lasting for 24 hours but it did last all day, which is important to me. I also like that I can easily get a bold look with this eyeliner, if I want too. It was easy to do. The liner goes on smooth and easy. It&#x27;s now my favorite black eyeliner to use. I don&#x27;t know why it says to shake it before using because I don&#x27;t hear anything in it and when I shake it, I&#x27;m not sure if it is actually doing anything or not. I like the fine tip because it makes it easy to do very thin lines, as well as, thick lines. The choice is up to you, depending on what type of look you want. I would definitely recommend this liquid eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I have used eyeliner for years. Now some I have used on my eyes were hard and rough to the eye lid. I have used soft ones that that glide on. I have used mechanical and pencil both. I have to say I was like liquid eye liner oh no this won&#x27;t be good. I am so wrong this is the easiest liquid eyeliner I have ever used. It is black and you can use it to make the perfect cat eye. I hope this come in more colors than black. I would buy them all. I did a test on the back of my hand. You can go as thick or thin of a line you would like. The tip is so soft and not hard like some of I have used. I think that is the reason it goes on nicely. Then I did the ultimate test. I put it on and not even 30 seconds and it was dry. I rubbed my hand hard and did not budge or smear at all. This will be my go to liner now. I am so glad I got this and can&#x27;t wait to see if I can get it in other colors.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this eyeliner, it was very dry and difficult to apply. Yes, I stored it upright per the directions. I purchased 2 so I tried the other pen and it was the same.</li>
    <li> One of the best eyeliners I have used...It dries fast and I can use my mascara right after it...amazing staying power...I swim with it, once in the morning and I am done...no need to reapply and it does not smudge at all</li>
    <li> I love the way this liner glides on my eyelids. I could have a ton of shadow on and this liner glides with ease! I have purchased many different types of eyeliners and even sample packs during the holidays but could never find the right one of me. I&#x27;m always in a rush and the less time I can spend applying my makeup, the better! This liner is very easy to control because it glides on so smoothly. I have oily eyelids so in the afternoon I normally have to reapply the liner but it&#x27;s really no problem since I&#x27;m used to it. I also love how this liner causes no eye irritation, there are a few liners out there that sting my eyes, this liner doesn&#x27;t cause any stinging. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out on my lids or cause &amp;#34;crust&amp;#34;. I received a free sample of this liner to test and offer my honest opinion. I absolutely love it! Out of the many liners I have tried, this is by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> usually I don&#x27;t leave feedback but this eye liner is so great that I have to let people know about it. I usually use Lancome eyeliner it&#x27;s still nice one but pricewise and qualitywise I think this one is the best eyeliner especially in hot weather and for oily skin.</li>
    <li> It was working great, I liked it, but then the tip broke off after only one use.  Disappointing!</li>
    <li> After I received this (on time by the way), I put it on immediately. I wore it for two days, TWO DAYS without any sort of smudging or smearing. This makeup is incredible. I had stood in the shower with the humidity and everything, and the makeup still didn&#x27;t smear. Totally awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to apply it so it looks best, but it stays on all day and through a grueling, very tough workout with the sweat dripping!  When it&#x27;s time to shower it comes off very easy with a little soap and water.</li>
    <li> The best liner in terms of ease of drawing, the tip staying in shape, and color compared to Kat Von D, Tarte, Covergirl, Almay, Dior. I highly recommend this and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I am very particular about what I use on my face, especially my eyes. It was stored for several days upside down, as the instructions stated. Normally, this type of eyeliner is difficult to put on evenly and usually takes a lot of practice. It went on very smoothly and evenly and stayed put from that morning until the following day, when it took several tries to remove it. I purposely left it on overnight to test its staying power and was NOT disappointed. The felt tip feel was very light and the liner did not smudge or run in the slightest. It is also cruelty free (not tested on animals) which was a HUGE selling point with me.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  See below for original review, I&#x27;m certainly no newbie to liquid eyeliner.  I had been contacted by the company and offered a refund PLUS a new pen.  I responded within 24 hours to be told that they had to submit the pen for further testing, and to check back in a few weeks. Great.  So, I patiently waited, used my other eyeliners, then remembered the email about 6 weeks later. I contacted the person, and was quickly sent another pen.  Again, the pen was uneven and dry, even with the tip stored down.  I used Urban Decay&#x27;s primer potion and Tarte eyeshadow first, as the pen does NOT stay without primer + shadow.  And the effect was the same: an uneven application, and once it dries (in seconds), you cannot go over it to try to fill in the spottiness as the pen will pick up the old ink and then it makes it clumpy.  If I was lucky enough to get it to lay somewhat evenly during application, it didn&#x27;t last 12 hours--and I don&#x27;t have oily lids.  So, two pens, same result.  After a week, it was in the trash and I&#x27;ve moved on to [[ASIN:B00O8B9X0U You&#x27;re So FINE liquid eyeliner Cruelty Free (Black) 3g/0.1oz by Elizabeth Mott]]--worth the extra $.  Thank you, Customer Service, but this product was not for me.       I&#x27;m no newbie to the liquid eyeliner world, I&#x27;ve been using liquid liners for 10+ years. I&#x27;ve been using this pen for 2 weeks now, so I think it&#x27;s fair to review it. The pen is easy to grip and the thickness is perfect for lining, but the product is dry, even after storing it tip down (see photos). I have to use the side of the tip to deposit the eyeliner on my upper lash line, making inner corners difficult. It also doesn&#x27;t deposit evenly, looking &amp;#34;spotty&amp;#34; and not boldly dark. When I try to go back over it after it dries (to darken it/fill it), it picks up the color that&#x27;s already there, making the color more uneven! I like to wing the corners out, and the eyeliner doesn&#x27;t hold up at the corners, even with a primer base. Unless it&#x27;s a faulty batch,I actually prefer NYX Super Skinny Eye Marker, Carbon Black,1.1ml or SEPHORA COLLECTION Contour Eye Pencil 12hr Wear Waterproof 0.04 Oz 01 Black Lace - Black (sharpens poorly, but STAYS). At $11 and $10, they are better values than a dried up $14 liner. I was disappointed with this product, given all the positive reviews.  I hope my photos are helpful. You can see the uneven lines on my upper lash line. A primer has been used, and I use Tarte&#x27;s eyeshadow. The lines drawn on my hand are as such: top line is using the tip, bottom lines are using the side of the tip. You can see it thickens and deposits better, but I have a difficult time lining my top lids using the edge of the tip, given I have less control this way.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeliner. It&#x27;s super black (others sometimes turn blue or grey when they oxidize). I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist, so I&#x27;m always on a quest for the perfect eyeliner. What keeps me from giving this five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t quite stay if you use it to line your waterline. It stays on the top lid ALL DAY, but doesn&#x27;t quite show up on the waterline. I do love the applicator, it allows for a lot of control and I&#x27;m able to make the line thick or thin very easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner because it has so many good reviews. But I was so disappointed when I tried it on. The eyeliner I received was really dry, like an old product, when I put it on it&#x27;s very uneven, really hard to get the whole line done. I had used at least 5 stila eyeliners and was just trying to see if something new would work. Failure.</li>
    <li> Okay, I really don&#x27;t get the rave reviews... I bought it off the great reviews thinking I had finally found THE EYELINER... As the description says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Does not go away with tears, eye drops, water, perspiration or while you sleep. You can take a quick shower at your office or swim at the gym, during the day without having to retouch your makeup.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely not true. I did try the shower thing and I had racoon eyes. So not waterproof. Then I put it on again for day wear and it again smudged  and it didn&#x27;t give me all day wear. Was gone before half the day was over. I returned this the next day and my search continues....</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it! She says its the best!</li>
    <li> AMAZING.  This is the only eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smear on my monolid during application.  absolute must.</li>
    <li> Loved this eye liner. It went on extremely smooth and lasted throughout the day without having to reapply it. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.</li>
    <li> no staying power. Soooo disappointed because I was actually very impressed with the application. The tip and liner were so smooth going on and did dry quick. Alas normal body heat ( only normal day- didn&#x27;t even exercise or anything) broke it down within hours. I had sticky black smudges all in my eyelid crease halfway through the workday  :( will need to go back to a formula that doesn&#x27;t smear all over after a couple hours of wear. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Super smudgey. Did not last more than maybe an hour or two on my lids even with a primer. The tip quality is not so great, it loses its shape after a few uses. Once I opened it and the whole top portion got stuck in the lid and I had to mess around with it to pull it out.</li>
    <li> Gives a great matte look and very dark</li>
    <li> This liner stayed on for 3 days without a problem. It is  very black so I put a little dark brown eyeshadow powder over it to soften the look. I used an eyelid primer first before applying the linerso I&#x27;m sure that helped in keeping the liner on.  Ii live in a dry climate soo not sure if humidity would make a difference. I would reorder it. Will check to see if they make a brown-black shade.</li>
    <li> I wore this to the pool for 5hrs, I had put it on at approximately noon. Later that night I attended a festival and returned around midnight. I went to bed without washing off my eye makeup and it was still in place when I woke up in the morning. It is like a felt-tip eyeliner. It is black, very fine tipped for a felt eyeliner and does come off with makeup remover easily. I was really impressed with the product. I had ordered it and it was supposed to come in in 2days, but when my package arrived it wasn&#x27;t in it. when I notified amazon I received it 2days later with my amazon prime. Great product.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product for a week then the pointy tip started to pull out when removing the cap.  It is still usable once you stick the tip back in the applicator, but your fingertips are black and messy.  The tip now comes off every time I remove the protective cap.</li>
    <li> NThis product did NOT perform as stated in their ad. Very disappointed. Supplier did contact me and gave me a refund. For that reason I gave 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a fan on how it applys. Have used less expensive ones that were much better</li>
    <li> I have never posted about a product before, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue with a product purchased on here. I trusted the other reviews, it sounded like the best eyeliner you can get. The delivery went smoothly, came the day expected considering the day before was a snow day. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a dud, but there is barely any ink coming out of the tip and it won&#x27;t even show up around my eyes at all. I went back to using the old one I had.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on nicely and easy to get a great wing - but it doesn&#x27;t last AT ALL. I don&#x27;t know when it started to wear off... but by 5 hours after application it was COMPLETELY gone. No line left AT ALL !</li>
    <li> Awesome liner! It stays on all day and applies easily.</li>
    <li> Was completely dried up when I received this. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Really easy to apply. Lovely effect.</li>
    <li> It was dried up when I received it. They said they would give me credit if I mailed it back to them. I didn&#x27;t waste my time. Just don&#x27;t waste your time with the mess.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Delivered quickly. Nice color. Very thin line can be drawn with tip.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> OK. This is definitely my new favorite eyeliner. I don&#x27;t think I could ever use another kind. Let me start by giving my back story. I have huge eyes, I mean take up a huge amount of my face, huge...and they look so much better if I line them with eyeliner in the waterline so it can really define them from the rest of my face. I have struggled with eyeliners running, getting in my eyes and irritating them until they are bloodshot and now I have giant RED eyes and black under them from the liner running. I read the great reviews on this liner and decided to try wearing eyeliner again. Well I am so glad I did. I have been using this liner for a few weeks and it dries super quick so nothing accidentally gets in my eyes and starts the irritation process and, wow, it really STAYS dry and looks the same at the end of the day as it did in the morning!!! I am buying this liner as Christmas presents for women in my family now!! Wonderful stuff!!</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever had. Slept and woke up and it was as if I just put it on. Long lasting,  doesn&#x27;t smudge or wipe off. It&#x27;s definitely a great find and new favorite.  It&#x27;s THE Easiest I Have EVER used. I highly recommend it. I wouldn&#x27;t spend 35dollars on it though . That is too pricey for me even though i do feel that it is worth it. It&#x27;s dries very fast as well.</li>
    <li> It dried out so fast that I feel ripped off! It does not even go on when I press it. Super disappointed! UPDATE- I was told   by the manufacturer I would get a replacement, then contacted by the seller and told I wouldn&#x27;t but that they would refund me instead and that I should have wetted it (I DID) and that it would work (so basically I was the problem). Love that kind of empathy!  I am giving back 2 stars for the manufacuters&#x27;s concern, but not too pleased with the seller&#x27;s lack of concern.</li>
    <li> I got this eyeliner for my wife because she has always wanted a way to get a clean line without smudges but was nervous about a liquid. She loves it! It was easy to use right away, just shake and go. She was very excited at the end of the day when it stayed in place without wearing or flaking. She has been experimenting with thin lines, thick lines and even the cat eye, she really likes the flexible tip and commented about how great the waterproofing is because it doesn&#x27;t run throughout the day. This is a great gift for anyone, regardless of their makeup experience, it is so easy to use and such great quality that it would please the person who has tried every eye liner out here or someone who has been too afraid to give it a shot. Makeup is a tough present for me to pick out for her but this eyeliner was an easy choice!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner performs as promised:  quick drying, easy to use, and non-irritating to the eyes. I use it with light pressure, as I prefer a natural look and the black color is quite intense. After the liner dries completely- literally only a few seconds- I use my eye shadow as I usually do to soften the look. Anyone who is trying for a dramatic eye would be happy without this step.&lt;br /&gt;The brush provided makes a very precise line and is easy to control. I have not found a problem with any drying out so far, and I expect to replace this in 3 months as suggested. I would recommend this to anyone who may be hesitant to use liquid eyeliner. It&#x27;s easy and lasts all day without smudging.</li>
    <li> This worked really well but dried up fast.</li>
    <li> True black color,does stay on, easy to make a wing, just enough product that comes out when applying. I certainly will be buying more. I also love that it&#x27;s a excellent quality and a good price.</li>
    <li> Not sure if defective, but it was dried out and the line was watery and not black at all. See picture below. I&#x27;m really disappointed and out $14.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible! It is not waterproof and smudges horribly! Additionally the color is not vibrant black it is almost a dull gray. I currently use a pot of eyeliner with a brush and it does smudge and I was looking for a smudge proof eyeliner… And this is not it. I am very disappointed that I wasted $14 each on 2 pens.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:87cd8cf4b83ee533ebab499f33a7bd17]]My eyes are more noticeable now when I first applied the automatic waterproof liquid eyeliner .&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a glow of my face being more put out their and my features of looks seem too improve more then it would if I had wore the pencil eyeliner , and the usual color would of been black as this automatic waterproof one.&lt;br /&gt;I seen the true results I work out on regular bases and far as sweat/ perspiration ~ peeling my oions for last night&#x27;s dinner ,  and having tears drop. NOo eyeliner dripped and I did fall asleep wearing it as well and waken up the next morning again no messing-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;up on my pillow case of eyeliner, then I took a Long  Shower still attached solid  surrounding  my upper/lower eyelids . So the  lasting  for 24 hours is Very very true + smudge-free with very little pressure to apply to my eyes is the reality of it and their were no interference with my accompanying make-UP  or oils and it does dry like site says in 3 seconds which is one of my best parts because I&#x27;am always in a rush out the door . And I&#x27;ll say the size 5.1 x 0.4 x 0.4 inches ; 0.2 ounce and up to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months statement seems none fiction to me ; ))  So it&#x27;s great for wild night parties after work, or an emergency overnight stay out of home , and is important to Store with tip down and never ever  leave it open and site says no allergies have been reported with this eyeliner. However if you experiment redness or itching, stop using it and seek medical advice.Plus is  animal cruelty free which I love to hear because I&#x27;am a animal lover friendly type of person .  if curious Ingredients are&lt;br /&gt;Distilled Water, 1.3 Butylene Glycol, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Black No. 2 (CI 77266), Ferric Ammonium Ferrocyanide (CI 77510), Styrene Acrylates Copolymer, Phenoxyetanol, Acrylates Ethylexyl Acrylate Copolymer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came very fast for me at Shipping Weight: 0.3 ounces and is courtesy of  Divinnas Cosmetics!!☺️&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;sfree  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve find and it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
    <li> First time I have used liquid eyeliner.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this and tried it on and I can say that I loved it! I kinda have oily skin and this stayed on and dryed within seconds compared to my other liquid eyeliners. Unfortunately I lost it after four days since I had it in my pockets going to order again and two this time. Very pleased with this order.</li>
    <li> First of all, I try to always purchase products that have not been tested on animals, so I LOVE that this brand of eyeliner does not do that. It also does not contain parabens. I try to keep all of that to a minimum. I was given a sample of this for product testing, and it does everything it says it will. It doesn&#x27;t run or smudge, it&#x27;s smooth, and the tiny tip really helps me with accuracy. I have a friend that will love this stuff, so I&#x27;m buying some for her, too. This doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the product, but I love the packaging as well!</li>
    <li> Already love it. Hopefully it will last and not dry out!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! It dries almost instantly and stays on all day and night!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is Amazing! The packaging is super cute! I&#x27;m not an eyeliner guru in any way but this liner made it easy to apply because of the felt tip point. I was able to create a baby wing in seconds and draw thick or thin lines. I recieved this liner for testing purposes and Yes the liner does dries quickly but it still gives you time to line your eyes and it stayed on all night without losing it&#x27;s pigmentation. I usually have to dab shadow on my liners to blend any harsh lines but this liner was smooth enough so no shadow was needed. I&#x27;m very impressed! I do own the benefit they&#x27;re real liner but the formulation in the Qualizzi liner is better and it does not crumble like the Benefit one. This intense black liner won&#x27;t move or smudge once on and comes off quickly with an oil based makeup remover. Overall I&#x27;m a happy camper:) Below is my eyeliner look I did with the fabulous Divinnas Liquid liner from Qualizzi.</li>
    <li> Love this Liquid eyeliner!  I love to wear eyeliner, but have never been able to find the right liquid eyeliner.  I they have either been really thin and runny and go every where or they have just haven&#x27;t gone on well at all.  So I was excited to be able to try and review this product.  I am very happy with the results.  The tip is really thin and the liner goes on very well.  No runs,no smudges. It stays where you put it. You control how much or how little you want.  It is waterproof and comes off easily when you remove your makeup.  I will be purchasing another for my daughter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worst. Do not buy. The ink filled very rare. For example, when you use it blank color looks like gray color.Moreover, Ink can&#x27;t be reached at end of blush. So you can&#x27;t draw details.&lt;br /&gt;Never make you fool through good reviews. Never believe!&lt;br /&gt;you will  weast money</li>
    <li> Works wonders. It is super easy to apply and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of pressure to apply it. It easily glides on where you need it and looks fabulous. It is a true dark black and extremely waterproof which is a great thing. Once it dries it doesn&#x27;t smear and looks good...I feel asleep with it on one night and it was still there and looking good in the morning which amazed me. I am so happy I was able to share my experiences of this gift I received.</li>
    <li> Best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve used. I only need to apply it once although I never wear makeup all day, I apply it in the afternoon or evening. No runniness. I plan on using it while on vacation next week. I&#x27;ll update my review to reflect how it works and lasts all day and in 90 degree weather. Well worth the money, I&#x27;ll certainly continue to purchase this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Item worked well one time.  2nd time it felt dry and I was storing as directed.  3rd time I opened it the applicator tip came completely out of the tube.  Had to use my fingers to get out of the cap getting it on my fingers and under my nails.  It was also dry as if old.  I have contacted amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this liquid liner💋💋💋</li>
    <li> Awesome liner! Dries nice and stays. looks pretty under shadow also.</li>
    <li> Not impressed! I went to apply and the entire top pull out of tube....the point could be finer. I&#x27;m back to using Tart!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a huge amount of makeup but always eyeliner and usually use a pencil, the liquid eye liners I&#x27;ve used in the last few years have tended to burn my eyes, but I decided to try this it ( I got an offer to review this for free) I have used it several times without it burning my eyes, it stays on, easy to apply, no running, the black is really black.  You must keep this with the point facing down so keep tip wet. Nicely made eyeliner . THank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually really nervous when it comes to eyeliner, mostly because I have a really twitchy and sensitive eye that makes it hard to apply. For this reason, I usually stick with the crayon-like eyeliners. This time however, I was selected to try out this product from a new user point of view. Right off the bat, I just have to say I love how clean of a look this eyeliner gives my eyes. It looks really sleek and kind of perfect compared to regular old pencil eyeliners. It was also a lot easier to apply than I thought it would be to put on, and I wasn&#x27;t constantly going back to correct my lines like I usually do with my normal eyeliner. Overall, I had a really great experience with this eyeliner, and I&#x27;ll definitely look into getting more.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyeliner. Easy to apply and lasts and lasts. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS EYELINER!  Finally, a liquid eyeliner that actually stays on the eye the entire day!!! Short of using a Sharpie, I had almost given up on finding something that doesn&#x27;t run or smear onto my greasy, crinkly but PRIMED eyelids. Even Stila wasn&#x27;t staying put so I&#x27;ve been using a hard matte primer to try to keep my eyes fresh - looking, but that was adding bulk to my &amp;#34;hoods&amp;#34; (which I&#x27;ll fix someday). With this eyeliner, I can wear a light primer with a dab of color shadow and when I come home from work, I look like I just left...no black eyes from smearing!! In fact, this stuff continues to look great even after work AND the gym AND a dinner date!! I am now a convert...gonna go buy a few more to keep stashed everywhere.</li>
    <li> Not waterproof :( comes off easy but does stay on if you don&#x27;t rub it</li>
    <li> The best waterproof eyeliner! Really i love it .. I will order more soon for my sisters</li>
    <li> Very effective. Lasts all day and night. This eyeliner is truly a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is the first liquid eyeliner I have ever used that I didn&#x27;t make a huge mess with. The applicator makes it very easy to make fine lines or thick ones of you want a bolder look. It dried in just a second and never smudged! My old pencil type eyeliners never lasted all day and they always smudged but, not this one! My eyeliner looked just as good at the end of the day as it did when I applied it! It is waterproof but removes very easily with a makeup remover wipe. I am in love with this eyeliner!</li>
    <li> It really works. I have teary eyes and it doesn&#x27;t run off nor smears like the other brand I was using.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will get another one.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye liner, it is dark and it really does last all day, my only problem might be consumer error, but when I put it on I can&#x27;t get it to look smooth and it tends to run and look a little lop sided, it seems to be a great product if I could get better at applying it.</li>
    <li> It dries up very quickly, but not in a positive way. It doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t run smoothly as my normal brand. The color is as expected.</li>
    <li> Ok, I cannot stress this enough... its the best eyeliner ever! I&#x27;ve paid 20 bucks for a gel waterproof eyeliner and it was a lie.... this eyeliner is absolutely the best...  I sweat and have oily skin and after a 12 hr day I look in the mirror this bad boy is still on!!! Absolutely impressed with how long it stays on.... plus it won&#x27;t break your bank lol... BUY IT! it&#x27;s different for everyone but this product is how it worked out for me!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is amazing. Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s there to stay! It compares in quality to the Stila waterproof liquid eyeliner pen, but I think I like this one even better (and it&#x27;s less expensive here on Amazon).</li>
    <li> Color doesn&#x27;t come out when drawn on. With harsh, intense pressure sometimes a line can be achieved, but if drawn over again it will crumble or peel off.</li>
    <li> Waste money , couldn&#x27;t finish one eye. Tube was empty or dry out.</li>
    <li> First impression, the liquid is very black, the applicator is great and precise. The liquid is a little watery but two coats did the job. I think I&#x27;ve tried 20 different liquid eyeliners in my life. Right now my regular liquid eyeliner costs me $50 but lasts for months and I really love it, except the price of course. I ordered this one because it had good reviews and was cheap enough to try. This eyeliner is just okay to me. It does last all day but the pen dried out really quickly. In my third use I noticed it was significantly drier than before. I think this is why it is cheap - there&#x27;s not enough liquid in it to keep the applicator properly hydrated for smooth, easy application. But maybe I got an old pen... I don&#x27;t know. Sorry to say I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is amazing for cateyes! I use it on my waterline too but it can be difficult not to get ink in your eye when applying on the waterline. It stays put on the waterline for a couple of hours but then needs to be reapplied. It stays on the skin all day no problem!</li>
    <li> My eye liner came already dried out, I am very disappointed and it does not make a defined line.  I have to go over the same spot many times to fill in the spots it missed.</li>
    <li> OK.... Everyone really up sold the s*** out of this eyeliner!!! I really thought this was going to be my new favorite eyeliner and not have to worry about going back to the NYX mouse eyeliner or MAC pencil liner but NOPE! I WILL NEVER BUY IT AGAIN... I kept the eyeliner pen in the upright position because I know from past experiences with those types they can dry out.. Well, mine dried out in about 2 1/2 weeks. I wear eyeliner everyday and it sucks when you go to use it and its just dried up tip while the sides have liquid coming out. Its a project now to apply the eyeliner to my eyes so I threw it out. Junk....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;+ Great for beginners with eyeliner!&lt;br /&gt;+ Rapid fast drying time&lt;br /&gt;+ Dark Black</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and perspire a lot from my face and no eyeliner seems to stay on all day. I bought this eyeliner to test it out like I do with most eyeliners. I did all the initial testing on my had and it seemed to pass them all. I have been using it for about a week in a half now. I like the thin tip it lets you be very precise with your lines. You can go as thick or thin as you like. Also, the color is very rich dark black which I love on my tan skin tone! It lasts all day at work and when I get home still looks pretty decent, with only one application and no primer! I even tried the sleep test. Some of it did rub off during sleep, which is a good thing wouldn&#x27;t want eyeliner staying on that long. My last test was going outside in Hot Texas, 99 degree heat and it mostly stayed on. Even with my sweating, it didn&#x27;t come off at all. It didn&#x27;t melt off my face like most eyeliners do, giving me raccoon eyes. I did noticed that if I touched it, it would smear and come off. It doesn&#x27;t stay on as well in the heat but it doesn&#x27;t melt which is a added plus. So far this is one of the better eyeliners I have purchased. Totally recommend for Oily Skin users.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Stilla and as an older gal, applying a liquid tastefully is a challenge.  This product was smooth, produced the style of line that I prefer and complimented the rest of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would LOVE to see this available in some other colors...hint hint hint!</li>
    <li> This liner is amazing. I was using stilas pen liner before and this is sooo much better. Still love stila but will be sticking to this liner from now on. It lasts all day and goes on perfectly.</li>
    <li> This seemed mostly dried up when I got it and it was very messy upon use and came off incredibly easy. Immediately went back to my trusty Stila waterproof liquid liner.</li>
    <li> Long lasting for eyeliner for sure.  The only problem is, the felt tip is so rough on the skin of my eye.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eyeliners (gel, liquid, pencils...etc) and this is by far my favorite.  It stays put all day without melting or smudged. Very easy to apply and is very forgiving.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more affordable alternative to the Stila Liquid Eyeliner (which I love).  I use the Stila eyeliner on a daily basis, and although I love it, there are two things about the product that made it difficult for me to justify the 20$ purchase: The felt tip loses its integrity (develops fuzzies) and dries out a bit within a month of usage. Also, my eyelids can get a bit oily during the day, causing the color to begin fading a bit towards the end of my 8 hour days.  Because of these reasons, I began looking for cheaper alternatives for the Stila Liquid eyeliner, and I think I finally found it.  The Divinnas eyeliner provides the same exact performance as the Stila at a cheaper price.  I&#x27;d even say that the felt tip on this product is a bit sturdier (just a bit) and seems to wear longer through my day.  Hope this tip helps.</li>
    <li> Just got this today and right on time! I was just getting ready to go out when it was delivered so I got a chance to use it right away.  Needless to say, I LOVE IT! It deposits the right amount of color, with the slightest pressure being the most precise eyeliner I have ever used, it just glided on my eye like silk! And when they say quick dry, they mean quick dry! In seconds it was dry &amp; I was then able to apply my mascara. I have had it on now for approximately 10+ hours and it looks fantastic, like I just put it on. I love the fact that you only have to apply it once and you are good for the entire day (&amp; night). I have tried many liquid eyeliners but none of them even come close to this little beauty! I&#x27;m sure my daughter will steal it from me so I&#x27;m sure I will be buying more in the future, that I have no doubt! I absolutely guarantee you&#x27;ll love it just as much as I do!</li>
    <li> The packaging is very cute and girly and this liner is paraben free and free from animal cruelty! This is a felt tip liner which is what I prefer. I think this is a great starter liner since it is forgiving and you can take your time with it, however if you are a seasoned felt liner user you might get a bit annoyed, since  it is not liquidy and you will have to take a few passes to get the desired line, but it lasts the entire day without rubbing off. It is also easily removed with soap and water or makeup remover. The tip is a bit dry, but it will give you a chance to perfect the line, especially if you are new to using a felt tip liner. It is a dark black liner. There is no odor. The tip on mine was a little uneven and not as thin as I expected, however I did not have a hard time applying.  I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions</li>
    <li> Well it is black it is a very highly pigmented true black. the tip is small and pointed to get a precise application.  It is certainly water poof, and smudge proof. On the back of my hand, I rubbed it vigorously, and it wouldnt budge, even hand sanitize and rubbing with a tissue there is still product left on my hand. this is a great long wearing,  highly pigmented eyeliner. The second time, I applied it to the back of my hand, let it sit for a moment, like before. I was able to remove it right away, not sure if it&#x27;s because the first time, it was brand new or what. I love the tip of this, you can get it very thin, or as thick as you want, and you hardly have to touch it to get enough product, no need to go over your lines more than once. Or, have a huge glob come out! It really is a pretty decent eyeliner!!! The one downside I had, was the box I received it in was damaged, and when I opened it, the eyeliner had dust and fingerprints on it... I wasn&#x27;t sure if it had been used or not. Maybe, the company can seal the product inside the box as well. I won&#x27;t be using this one on my eyes. Product received for reviewing purposes. For some reason amazon wont let me add pictures. :(</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is extremely easy to apply and looks great. I only wear eyeliner on my top lid, not waterline. The reason I&#x27;m leaving 3/5 stars is that it is definitely NOT waterproof. For example I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant, which may seem irrelevant but I have my pride...anyway, because of this I am quite hormonal and prone to tearing up at the drop of a hat. Just the slightest amount of tearing (even the tears I&#x27;m able to dab before they come spilling out of my eyes) and the liner comes right off. When I have a 5 second+ balling sesh I welcome raccoon eyes. In case you&#x27;re thinking maybe this is just salt water, rain does the same, a cool-lukewarm shower, spraying a mist of any sort on my face, eye drops, etc. However, IF no water touches the liner it remains uncompromised; smudge-proof.</li>
