      <li>Excellent!</li>
      <li>Very good toothbrush!</li>
      <li>and it does an excellent job cleaning his teeth, so</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
      <li>Though this brush is very excellent .Clean</li>
      <li>I am very impressed with this brush.</li>
      <li>It works great!  </li>
      <li>Do your own research please!!</li>
      <li>I have very good experience with this brush.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s happy, we&#x27;re happy - yay for Spinbrush!</li>
      <li>She loved it!  </li>
      <li>The idea is great but the design could use some modifying based upon a child&#x27;s age.</li>
      <li>He now stands in the bathroom brushing his teeth and looking so proud.</li>
      <li>If you want a good tomato-pollination brush, this is a good buy!</li>
      <li>It works great and it so very cute for toddlers.</li>
      <li>Our toddler is now brushing his teeth and we regard it a good habit and try to encourage it in a variety of ways.</li>
      <li>Something about all this doesn&#x27;t make good sense--even dollars and cents, to me.   </li>
      <li>Its a good for the value you paid for.</li>
      <li>The concept of the spinbrush is great but we will not be using any more of them.  </li>
      <li>Please make sure that you do not let your kids use this unsupervised!.</li>
      <li>I am NOT at all pleased I could not find an affordable electric toothbrush for a child that had replaceable heads!  </li>
      <li>The switch acts as both a momentary button as well as a toggle switch, which is nice for the pollination.  </li>
      <li>My daughter says doctor&#x27;s comment on how nice his teeth look.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the Thomas toothbrush for my toddler to brush her own teeth.</li>
      <li>This was an easy purchase; may buy another one soon!  </li>
      <li>This toothbrush is super cute, and my toddler loved it.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to always use a pet toothpaste.</li>
      <li>He will love to brush his teeth with Thomas</li>
      <li>I love using spinbrushes on my kids because I feel like their teeth get cleaner with more revolutions per minute with the spin brush</li>
      <li>More goo.</li>
      <li>My son just love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute, and he likes to put it in his mouth and gnaw on it, and to push the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love the toothbrush and I can&#x27;t wait to see my grandson use it.</li>
      <li>I will NOT be buying any more of these for sure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute.</li>
      <li>Ok, I get that</li>
      <li>It is very friendly to the children.</li>
      <li>most importantly, my son now enjoys brushing his teeth and the brush actually does a very good job of removing plaque....</li>
      <li>It is easy to brush.</li>
      <li>He immediately took to the brush and found it easy to operate.</li>
      <li>Clean teeth better than a manual brush can&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Easy to turn it on and turn if off.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so they were very excited to see this brush, and they like clicking it on and off, which makes brushing more exciting for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not certain how good he is at it, but his teeth look bright and clean.</li>
      <li>the perfect little breeding grounds for mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, because it cleans my kid&#x27;s teeth well and because they enjoy using it, I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My toddler constantly wants to use Daddy&#x27;s electric toothbrush, and loves turning it on and brushing his own teeth with it.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I feel isn&#x27;t so great</li>
      <li>makes brushing teeth more fun at bedtime at our house.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>Cute design makes brushing fun</li>
      <li>It works pretty well and he seems to enjoy it  more than a manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>He was really excited to use this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>But parents please be aware that it is our responsibility to review this product for our kids since they do not know better.  </li>
      <li>I am concerned that I am reading more and more about old and b-stock items being sold on Amazon.</li>
      <li>He always loved holding a toothbrush and sticking it in his mouth, but now he&#x27;s much more willing to have the bristles actually doing something.  </li>
      <li>So, I guess if you buy it with fresh batteries and plan on it being disposable after one use, it would be fine.  </li>
      <li>If your kid must have a character or themed toothbrush just get a traditional one, it&#x27;s just as good as this one</li>
      <li>So we fill the landfill with a cool \\&quot;Thomas</li>
      <li>No matter how good you rinse, it will inevitably grow mold.  </li>
      <li>Yes it is pricey since you have to replace so often, but it&#x27;s worth the price to see my son have clean teeth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Might be ok for an older kid.  </li>
      <li>While it likely works great, and he does enjoy pushing the train to make it spin, he hates it coming anywhere near his mouth.</li>
      <li>teeth better than normal brush</li>
      <li>so when we got it he was very interested in it and let me brush his teeth.  </li>
      <li>I thought the spin brush might be a turn off for him, but he actually likes the feel AND does a better job brushing!  </li>
      <li>Great looking toothbrush and worked well for a few weeks until I could smell mold from the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Our grandsons(ages 3 and 5), happily use these toothbrushes everyday.  </li>
      <li>and I know it is helping clean his teeth better than he would allow with a standard brush that doesn&#x27;t spin.  </li>
      <li>Yes as you will see from other reviews my kids loved this product.  </li>
      <li>They were in the part of the brush that goes RIGHT into my kid&#x27;s mouth.</li>
      <li>For right now we are just trying to create a routine and prevent cavities.</li>
      <li>I guess the plus-side of it is you have a cute mechanical brush to clean your grout and get at the little corners of your baseboards when it&#x27;s no longer fit for teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>In any event, this spin brush has soft bristles and goes at a medium speed that is easily tolerable by my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think that is pretty wasteful considering</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll see how it goes with his first visit to the dentist.</li>
      <li>More recently my wife discovered a \\&quot;Spinbrush for Kids.</li>
      <li>He now willingly brushes his teeth (without me having to nag) - and for longer than 30 seconds.  </li>
      <li>We plan to get more spin brush in the future.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am pleased now.</li>
      <li>We bought this along with the Thomas tooth paste which is also fantastic and our 2.5 year old went from not brushing to wanting to brush.</li>
      <li>Great little toothbrush for my two year old grandson.  </li>
      <li>product significantly reduced the amount of time it took to brush my 3 year old&#x27;s teeth....</li>
      <li>I purchased this toothbrush for my 3 year old son and he was so excited with Thomas brush.</li>
      <li>This is really good because it is difficult for the children to stay calm, battery operated brush helps us brush easily and finish the task.</li>
      <li>The whole reason I ordered online was because I don&#x27;t have much time to get to the store.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe they are both from the same company, but the Globrush designed for teens is fantastic and my son has been using it since he was 5...</li>
      <li>My son has used this so much that we have worn out the batteries.</li>
      <li>Though this product is really for brushing teeth, I bought this to pollinate indoor-grown tomato plants.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m somewhat of a germaphobe and that really bothers me to put something in my sons mouth that was unwrapped.</li>
      <li>but I would definitely be more careful about using this product!</li>
      <li>My  3 1/2 year old grand-son was excited about this toothbrush and that is a real plus when regular brushing is our goal.  </li>
      <li>My son was getting bored with traditional toothbrushes, so this was perfect!</li>
      <li>Hopefully they will enable a better method for vetting their vendors to prevent such occurrences in the future.</li>
      <li>not just this particular one.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>* Large, easy on/off switch (much easier than the adult Spinbrushes which get slippery if they get a little toothpaste on them)&lt;br /</li>
      <li>This brush does a decent job at cleaning my son&#x27;s teeth, but the batteries die very frequently.  </li>
      <li>You have to hold the button down (which is not that easy)</li>
      <li>a very busy working mom, so I don&#x27;t have time to return a TOOTHBRUSH at the post office.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My 4y/o son loves it. Now he is on the stage of trying hard to be independent and this toothbrush really helps...</li>
    <li> Our grandsons(ages 3 and 5), happily use these toothbrushes everyday.  However, their dentist said the electric toothbrushes do not take the place of supervised brushing.  After the children use them,  a parent should turn the toothbrush off and brush the teeth again.</li>
    <li> Our toddler is now brushing his teeth and we regard it a good habit and try to encourage it in a variety of ways. One is letting him use a bubble gum flavored toothpaste which he loves. Yech! I can&#x27;t stand it but he loves using it so, what the hey. More recently my wife discovered a \\&quot;Spinbrush for Kids. It&#x27;s a battery-powered tooth brush decorated in the style of Thomas the Train. He also loves trains, I might add. He immediately took to the brush and found it easy to operate. He now stands in the bathroom brushing his teeth and looking so proud. It&#x27;s cute. I&#x27;m not certain how good he is at it, but his teeth look bright and clean. We&#x27;ll see how it goes with his first visit to the dentist. I&#x27;m not looking forward to it. We have enough trouble with the doctor&#x27;s office where they stick needles in him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
    <li> My 2 yr old son LOVES this toothbrush.  He now willingly brushes his teeth (without me having to nag) - and for longer than 30 seconds.  I would recommend this brush to anyone whose child adores Thomas but doesn&#x27;t quite adore brushing teeth!  The only thing I feel isn&#x27;t so great is that you can&#x27;t get replacement brushes - you have to toss the entire brush.  Not so earth-friendly.</li>
    <li> My son loves it, because it has Thomas on it and it&#x27;s easy to use.  Easy to turn it on and turn if off.  Handle is right size for small toddler hands.</li>
    <li> This brush does a decent job at cleaning my son&#x27;s teeth, but the batteries die very frequently.  It takes AAA batteries which we don&#x27;t have laying around a lot.  It also is hard to find a screwdriver small enough to open the battery compartment.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Clean teeth better than a manual brush can&lt;br /&gt;* Batteries are replaceable (2 AAA)&lt;br /&gt;* Large, easy on/off switch (much easier than the adult Spinbrushes which get slippery if they get a little toothpaste on them)&lt;br /&gt;* Cute design makes brushing fun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Toothbrush heads aren&#x27;t replaceable&lt;br /&gt;* The screw to unlock the battery compartment is tiny -- you need a small screwdriver such as those from eyeglass repair kits&lt;br /&gt;* The screws can be very hard to turn as they can get rusty/stuck from water and toothpaste and the tiny screwdrivers offer no leverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this product 5-stars if the heads could be replaced as with the adult Spinbrushes. I guess the plus-side of it is you have a cute mechanical brush to clean your grout and get at the little corners of your baseboards when it&#x27;s no longer fit for teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note for pet owners: We recently started using these to brush our dogs&#x27; teeth and saw immediate improvement. It only took a couple of sessions for them to get used to electric toothbrushes and their teeth are much cleaner for it, especially those large upper molars which were always difficult to get completely clean with manual brushes. Be sure to always use a pet toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Mine does.  He was really excited to use this toothbrush.  Doesn&#x27;t completely end tooth brushing struggles, but does help minimize them.</li>
    <li> My  3 1/2 year old grand-son was excited about this toothbrush and that is a real plus when regular brushing is our goal.  My daughter says doctor&#x27;s comment on how nice his teeth look.  I am NOT at all pleased I could not find an affordable electric toothbrush for a child that had replaceable heads!  So we fill the landfill with a cool \\&quot;Thomas the Train\\&quot; product?  Something about all this doesn&#x27;t make good sense--even dollars and cents, to me.   Hope someone making decisions about products is reading this!</li>
    <li> The only way my son will allow us to brush his teeth is with this toothbrush.  He is 20 months old and I grew sick of fighting him night and day with the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, yes, he will have to use a regular, non mechanical toothbrush.  For right now we are just trying to create a routine and prevent cavities.</li>
    <li> Do yourself and everyone else a favor by not buying this product. You can&#x27;t replace the heads and end up having to throw the whole unit away after about 1 month of regular brushing. Some have said they don&#x27;t make the heads replaceable for safety reasons (so a child doesn&#x27;t choke on it). Ok, I get that but seriously let&#x27;s keep this stuff out of our landfills. If your kid must have a character or themed toothbrush just get a traditional one, it&#x27;s just as good as this one and it&#x27;s a lot less plastic &amp; parts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything, but I&#x27;m so disgusted that I spent money on this toothbrush and the package was not even sealed shut.&lt;br /&gt;The packages looked deliberately opened, dirty and the toothbrush bristles had little black fuzz- so it has definitely been taken out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a very busy working mom, so I don&#x27;t have time to return a TOOTHBRUSH at the post office. The whole reason I ordered online was because I don&#x27;t have much time to get to the store. Oh well :/&lt;br /&gt;There was not an option for -0- stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son for a stocking stuffer for Christmas and got the decorate-your-own one for my daughter.  After about two weeks, it stopped working and wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I figured the batteries were dead and even got the special, tiny screwdriver that fit the screw to open the battery compartment.  Unfortunately, the screw was so tight, I couldn&#x27;t budge it without stripping the edges off the screw.  So, I guess if you buy it with fresh batteries and plan on it being disposable after one use, it would be fine.  But I was disappointed with this purchase and returned it within 30 days for a full refund.  I won&#x27;t tell you how sad my son was at having to return his cool new toothbrush...</li>
    <li> My son loves this toothbrush....I however about didn&#x27;t get this in the time I needed it.  Took forever to get to me....looked like there was a problem in the postal service.  Overall, I am pleased now.</li>
    <li> product significantly reduced the amount of time it took to brush my 3 year old&#x27;s teeth....most importantly, my son now enjoys brushing his teeth and the brush actually does a very good job of removing plaque....no more bleeding gum lines....will highly recommend product.</li>
    <li> My 15-mo-old son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended an electric tooth brush and we chose this one. While it likely works great, and he does enjoy pushing the train to make it spin, he hates it coming anywhere near his mouth. We&#x27;ll keep trying, but for now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a 15-mo-old.</li>
    <li> my 5-year old loves it, what can I say he loves thomas, the only drawback is the head is not replacable</li>
    <li> This was an easy purchase; may buy another one soon!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the unit is not rechargeable (batteries only) and the brush head is not changeable.  But that&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> My boy 5, loves brushing his teeth with his spinbrush. I&#x27;m relieved that a boy colour and design came - Thomas the train.</li>
    <li> I know that the Globrush is for teens, but it actually works.  This variety does not...it wastes too much power playing that horrible low quality music that only a deaf person can tolerate.  The toothbrush is weak and worthless.  Start saving for dental visits if you buy this brush.  I can&#x27;t believe they are both from the same company, but the Globrush designed for teens is fantastic and my son has been using it since he was 5...I don&#x27;t have to nag him to brush for 2 minutes.  All of the music toothbrushes are terrible...not just this particular one.</li>
    <li> My son loves brushing his teeth because of this toothbrush.  The spin brush is the dentist recommendation. We plan to get more spin brush in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this battery powered toothbrush as a gift for a 3 year old who LOVES anything involving Thomas the Train.  Unfortunately, the child has to push the button (the train&#x27;s face) on the front of the toothbrush in order to activate the power while guiding the toothbrush in order to clean his teeth.  This seems to be too difficult of a task to coordinate for a 3 year old who is just learning how to brush his teeth.  The idea is great but the design could use some modifying based upon a child&#x27;s age.</li>
    <li> love the toothbrush and I can&#x27;t wait to see my grandson use it. He will love to brush his teeth with Thomas</li>
    <li> I have two year old daughter. I have very good experience with this brush. It is very friendly to the children. It is easy to brush. This is really good because it is difficult for the children to stay calm, battery operated brush helps us brush easily and finish the task. My kids loves and enjoys brushing. I recommend this brush to other parents to their chilren. My kid likes trains so I prefer this design for her.</li>
    <li> My son has used this so much that we have worn out the batteries. It works great and it so very cute for toddlers.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Thomas toothbrush for my toddler to brush her own teeth. She loved it!  We have thrown it away because it started leaking a yellow substance out of the holes in the back of the brush. I am guessing it was some sort of lubricating oil.  Needless to say, I don&#x27;t think it is safe for her.  The concept of the spinbrush is great but we will not be using any more of them.  I will be notifying the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is super cute, and my toddler loved it.  It worked in terms of getting him to want to brush his teeth every day.  But, the little Thomas part keeps falling off, which is a MAJOR CHOKING RISK, especially for younger children.  Also, I&#x27;ve had it less than 60 days and the battery is completely dead.  What&#x27;s worse is the screw on the battery compartment is so small that even the smallest screwdriver is too small.  So it&#x27;s essentially a throw-away toothbrush (and an expensive one!)</li>
    <li> My 18 month old son loves this toothbrush! You push down on Thomas, and push up slightly-- this keeps the toothbrush on/spinning... You DO NOT need to hold Thomas the entire time as stated in other reviews. My son was getting bored with traditional toothbrushes, so this was perfect! He looks forward to brushing and does it for longer now that he has this Thomas spinbrush. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> My 4 1/2 yr old son loves this toothbrush. This is the second time I have purchased it for him after we wore out the first one.</li>
    <li> Item is really good for kids who are difficult to get to brush their teech.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews a couple of parents complained about having to push the button but it won&#x27;t stay on... I thought that to until I figured out you have to push up and the brush stays on (continuious). Lol to the parents that couldn&#x27;t figure that out because I was frustrated to until I got it.</li>
    <li> Though this product is really for brushing teeth, I bought this to pollinate indoor-grown tomato plants.  It works great!  Just press the button and touch the center of the tomato flower and the oscillating toothbrush head causes the flower to self-pollinate, like a bee buzzing the flower.  I already have tomato fruit forming.  The brush feels solid, was not very expensive compared to other vibrating toothbrushes, and even came with the batteries.  The switch acts as both a momentary button as well as a toggle switch, which is nice for the pollination.  If you want a good tomato-pollination brush, this is a good buy!</li>
    <li> This product worked well for us because our son like Thomas, but the head is not replaceable, so you must buy a new one every 3 months if you use it everyday. When I searched in the web about the replacement head (to confirm it is indeed not replaceable), I found our that there is a recent FDA warning about this product by the Food and Drug Administration. Apparently the parts can break off and create choking hazard and cut the mouth. Please make sure that you do not let your kids use this unsupervised!. Here is a news article about this:[...]  I read up on this topic and apparently the FDA took action because the company swept consumer complaints under the table. I would still use this product but I would definitely be more careful about using this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my 3 year old son and he was so excited with Thomas brush.I am very impressed with this brush.Though this brush is very excellent .Clean teeth better than normal brush</li>
    <li> Brushing teeth was a nightmare for my 18 month old. He would kick and scream no matter what we tried, resulting in us not even trying to brush his teeth every day. Our pediatrician suggested a spin brush so I found this on Amazon. Now my son actually runs to the bathroom when we tell him it&#x27;s time to brush his teeth. He likes looking at Thomas and saying \\&quot;choo choo\\&quot; and once I get the brush in his mouth he smiles and laughs cause he likes the feeling. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I love using spinbrushes on my kids because I feel like their teeth get cleaner with more revolutions per minute with the spin brush than I could provide by hand, especially because they only let me brush their teeth for such a short period of time before they get fed up. My son and daughter are big Thomas the train fans so they were very excited to see this brush, and they like clicking it on and off, which makes brushing more exciting for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 1.5 year old and a 3 year old and I find that they let me brush longer with a spin brush than with a manual brush, maybe because I am inadvertently pressing harder with a manual brush. In any event, this spin brush has soft bristles and goes at a medium speed that is easily tolerable by my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that it is hard for us to change the battery even with a tiny screwdriver type tool. Also, I wish that this brush allowed you to change the head. It seems like such a waste to buy an entirely new spinbrush when the head is worn out. However, because it cleans my kid&#x27;s teeth well and because they enjoy using it, I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> He always made humming noises while brushing teeth with me because he would hear my sonic care toothbrush so  I decided to buy this for him.  He loves it always asking to &amp;#34;brush teeth Grammy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly disgusted at the condition of this product sold by NetMart via Amazon. The Child&#x27;s Spinbrush Toothbrush packaging was previously opened,  OLD stock (2009), clumsily closed with tape, possibly used. Yuck. Would you want to give this to your child? Or as a gift to someone else&#x27;s child?! It is bad enough that this product appears to have been opened and possibly used, but add that this is something that goes into a child&#x27;s mouth and NetMart &amp; Amazon should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. Four star product, zero star supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon via online chat and Amazon at least stood behind the sale and promised to make things right. Kudos to Amazon for that. I am concerned that I am reading more and more about old and b-stock items being sold on Amazon. Hopefully they will enable a better method for vetting their vendors to prevent such occurrences in the future.</li>
    <li> We bought this along with the Thomas tooth paste which is also fantastic and our 2.5 year old went from not brushing to wanting to brush.</li>
    <li> When we received this product, the packaging was completely open and the toothbrush was practically falling. I&#x27;m somewhat of a germaphobe and that really bothers me to put something in my sons mouth that was unwrapped. It looked like this had been sitting on the shelf for a long time and was very old. I actually haven&#x27;t used it and probably won&#x27;t because it makes me nervous. I have pictures if anyone would like to see.</li>
    <li> My nephew just loves this</li>
    <li> Great looking toothbrush and worked well for a few weeks until I could smell mold from the toothbrush. There are little holes in the back on the head and neck of the toothbrush that hold water and will develop mold eventually.</li>
    <li> My son loves Thomas the train &amp; I had such a hard time getting him to want to brush before this toothbrush came. It&#x27;s also much easier to brush toddler&#x27;s teeth with an electric toothbrush since my son gives me a hard time with the brush strokes on a regular toothbrush. Yes it is pricey since you have to replace so often, but it&#x27;s worth the price to see my son have clean teeth.</li>
    <li> It did not last very long and the spin part not particularly effective for brushing the teeth of a toddler.</li>
    <li> Yes as you will see from other reviews my kids loved this product.  But parents please be aware that it is our responsibility to review this product for our kids since they do not know better.  For starters, this is a single use item meaning you cannot change out the brush once it gets nasty.  I think that is pretty wasteful considering it is an electronic toothbrush.  Also as in other reviews there is little holes on the back that harbor bacteria and mold.  No matter how good you rinse, it will inevitably grow mold.  Also the FDA and Fox News did a write up on these brushes about little pieces coming loose and breaking teeth or causing choking hazards.  Do your own research please!!</li>
    <li> Great little toothbrush for my two year old grandson.  He loves it and I know it is helping clean his teeth better than he would allow with a standard brush that doesn&#x27;t spin.  Thomas the train is a big draw for him too..</li>
    <li> My toddler constantly wants to use Daddy&#x27;s electric toothbrush, and loves turning it on and brushing his own teeth with it.  So we got him this one (which we figured would be lighter and smaller).  It&#x27;s cute, and he likes to put it in his mouth and gnaw on it, and to push the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main negative for us is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on once you press the button.  You have to hold the button down (which is not that easy) the entire time to make it work.  My 18 month old cannot possibly coordinate these movements.  He can push it down when it&#x27;s not in his mouth, but to hold it in his mouth and hold the button down is not happening (unlike with daddy&#x27;s brush).  I try to have him hold it in his mouth while I push, but he gets frustrated as he wants to do it himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be ok for an older kid.  But this one&#x27;s not working for us, as a real toothbrush at least.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to get my 2 year old to brush his teeth. It works pretty well and he seems to enjoy it  more than a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I will preface this review by saying that my 5 year old son *loves* this toothbrush and it does an excellent job cleaning his teeth, so we will probably continue to use them. But we will be diligent about replacing them frequently and here&#x27;s why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day, I was changing the battery on the brush yet again (FYI, this thing eats AA&#x27;s like candy) and noticed that the little drainage holes on the back of the brush head, behind the bristles, looked awfully black. I ran the brush under some hot water and gave it a *very* hard rap on the edge of the sink. A chunk of slimy black goo hit the porcelain. I did it again. More goo. Repeat about a dozen times with the same result....chunk after chunk of black crud. Gross! And those tiny pockets of mold? They were in the part of the brush that goes RIGHT into my kid&#x27;s mouth. Not exactly what I&#x27;d call \\&quot;hygienic\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And before you start questioning my child&#x27;s ability to properly rinse his brush after use, you should now that he has ASD and *I* brush his teeth and rinse out his brush. We use ordinary, kids&#x27; fluoride toothpaste. The brush is kept in the same drawer as the rest of the family&#x27;s non-moldy toothbrushes. The only difference is that his brush is the only one with itty-bitty, moisture-capturing holes in it....the perfect little breeding grounds for mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you can&#x27;t microwave this brush to sanitize it and the brush head isn&#x27;t replaceable, I guess the only solution is to dry this brush as thoroughly as possible between uses and to throw it away before it has a chance to get moldy.</li>
    <li> I could&#x27;t make my toddler brush his teeth. so when we got it he was very interested in it and let me brush his teeth.  i thought he would be afraid of spinbrush, but no, it is not too loud.</li>
    <li> Its a good for the value you paid for. My son just love this toothbrush. Too bad it good bad really quick due my son habit of chewing the tooth brush</li>
    <li> makes brushing teeth more fun at bedtime at our house.&lt;br /&gt;We even dropped it in the bathtub a few times and it still works fine.</li>
    <li> My son loves this Thomas toothbrush.  I thought the spin brush might be a turn off for him, but he actually likes the feel AND does a better job brushing!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A speech therapist suggested we help stimulate our toddler&#x27;s mouth with a battery-powered toothbrush. We were a little dubious, but figured why not.  It turns out he loves it!  He always loved holding a toothbrush and sticking it in his mouth, but now he&#x27;s much more willing to have the bristles actually doing something.  He&#x27;s happy, we&#x27;re happy - yay for Spinbrush!</li>
    <li> I am the idiot who has bought not one but TWO of these toothbrushes, hoping to not run into the same problem twice.  Each time the battery has run down we have been unable to remove the screw securing the battery cover to replace the battery.  On BOTH!  We are using the correct size screwdriver but the screw is so tight it strips the screw and we&#x27;ve ended up throwing the entire thing away.  I will NOT be buying any more of these for sure.</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush!</li>
