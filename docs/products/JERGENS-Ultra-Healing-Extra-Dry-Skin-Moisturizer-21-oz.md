      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I have actinic keratosis as well as very dry skin, and this has made my skin feel great.  </li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite lotion, so much so that he refuses to use anything else.  </li>
      <li>I am sure my husband wonders why his lotion is used up so much quicker than mine.  </li>
      <li>I have eczema, and although it is much better than it used to be, I have not been able to totally get rid of it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy like many body lotions and actually gets into my skin rather than just lying on top.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is good enough that it may actually be worth saying \\&quot;you are right\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I have really dry skin , apply it after shower and keeps skin good all day.</li>
      <li>I am referring to the picture shown right now.</li>
      <li>I apply it twice a day-after I get out of the shower in the morning, and right before I go to bed.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>This lotion normally works for me as a stand-alone moisturizer; although, during the winter months I supplement with a more intense, healing lotion for my hands (like Eucerin or Aquaphor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different lotions and the Jergens Ultra Healing far and away works the best.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t last through a good scrubbing, but is way, way better than other products.  </li>
      <li>For those of you who have seen the commerical, my right elbow used to look exactly like the \\&quot;before\\&quot; in the \\&quot;before &amp; after\\</li>
      <li>This product is very reasonably priced for what it does.  </li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate and wash my hands frequently, so a good lotion is a must.</li>
      <li>Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion keep my skin soft and smooth even during the coldest months of the year.</li>
      <li>, THANK YOU SO MUCH jERGENS!</li>
      <li>It definitely moisturizer, I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s totally affordable, you can buy this super cheap at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With many other lotions, even a quick water rinse requires reapplying.  </li>
      <li>i can buy a bigger bottle , life is good and will definitely buy again</li>
      <li>Looked at alot of different lotions on Amazon , some had chemicals in them, that if you Google the chemicals it was like those drug ads that say how good you will feel but the side affects is sudden death .</li>
      <li>No, my skin is not that dry, but I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>It is also available in several sizes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent alot of years shuffling throught many lotions.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Jergens is also very affordable.  </li>
      <li>Fast absorbing. .</li>
      <li>This lotion is really helping her hands.</li>
      <li>(Many other lotions sting for awhile,.)  </li>
      <li>This particular bottle is a pump bottle.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>And after two weeks it is like I have a brand new elbow.</li>
      <li>started using this for summer (pool) and winter (dry air) then recommended it to my Dad who has always had super, super dry skin on his legs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Ultra Healing lotion is exactly what I wanted for leathery skin from construction work, but I received another formula initially.  </li>
      <li>The real difference with this is that it doesn&#x27;t wash off the first time my hands get wet.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s less greasy feeling than most lotions, although every hand lotion has some oil in it so it can&#x27;t be totally avoided.</li>
      <li>I recommend this lotion for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotions since when I was young</li>
      <li>Company personnel were very accommodating and sent me the correct item later.</li>
      <li>and I am 45 years old now</li>
      <li>I get very dry skin in the winter and Jergens helps keep my legs smooth and reduces the irritation from the dry skin.</li>
      <li>She went to a medical conference, where it was highly recommended for any skin issues.  </li>
      <li>Even our relatively mild winters in southern Georgia are rough on her hands.</li>
      <li>I have this huge bottle in my bathroom and then small trial sizes all over and a medium one in my kitchen.</li>
      <li>, I have a very sensitive skin and Jergens lotion is the only lotion that works for me.</li>
      <li>I am a little embarrassed to say that my husband is actually right on this one.  </li>
      <li>, I have tried other lotions but haven&#x27;t found one I like as much as this one</li>
      <li>I had some very deep cracking around my thumbs and after only couple days of using the Jergens my hands were back to normal.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very comforting and only stings slightly and only for a minute on eczema skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have a bottle of this on my nightstand because I&#x27;m trying to use it up as soon as possible.  I put it on my hands and arms every night before I go to sleep, and I swear I wake up drier than before I put it on.  I&#x27;m too cheap to throw it away, but I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s gone!</li>
    <li> This lotion is so good, I wrote the company!  I asked them to please..not to &#x27;improve&#x27; or change it..to leave it the way it is!  They said it&#x27;s one of their best selling items. I was relieved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this for summer (pool) and winter (dry air) then recommended it to my Dad who has always had super, super dry skin on his legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the best! I have this huge bottle in my bathroom and then small trial sizes all over and a medium one in my kitchen. No, my skin is not that dry, but I love this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t just last for a few hours, it lasts to the next day, even after sleeping!  Plus, it&#x27;s totally affordable, you can buy this super cheap at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I always do the &#x27;tester&#x27; at more expensive stores and have even gotten a prescription lotion for my pool rash summers.  Nothing comes close to this Jergens Ultra Healing, including their other products.  I am a bit of a lotion freak, always trying them on, even at friend&#x27;s houses, and this is by far the best.  And the scent is nice too, not overpowering, just right.</li>
    <li> I work in a manufacturing environment that is very tough on my hands. So tough that areas of my hands get dried out and crack almost to the point of bleeding. I&#x27;ve tried several different lotions and the Jergens Ultra Healing far and away works the best. It&#x27;s less greasy feeling than most lotions, although every hand lotion has some oil in it so it can&#x27;t be totally avoided. It also is advertised to penetrate up to 5 layers of skin deep and I believe it. I had some very deep cracking around my thumbs and after only couple days of using the Jergens my hands were back to normal. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I have ever used. For those of you who have seen the commerical, my right elbow used to look exactly like the \\&quot;before\\&quot; in the \\&quot;before &amp; after\\&quot; shot. My left elbow is perfectly fine, but my right has always been dry and painful all year long. Weird, I know. I&#x27;ve tried countless products to remedy this. I have never found anything that works better than this lotion. I apply it twice a day-after I get out of the shower in the morning, and right before I go to bed. I saw great improvement after one week. And after two weeks it is like I have a brand new elbow. Not to mention how great the rest of my skin feels. :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion as much as i love my kid! ;o) the smell, the texture, everything about it, it&#x27;s that awesome. i&#x27;ve had to stop using it for two weeks to test out a different lotion to treat keratosis pilaris (KP). the other lotion (Eucerin intensive therapy) helped KP but my skin feel DRY! and i&#x27;m NOT loving how greasy it leaves my skin! i&#x27;m going to start using jergens and Eucerin together hoping to fix my issues ha. my cousin (who lives in germany) begs for me to brings bottles of this stuff when i visit (since it&#x27;s not sold overseas). it really is an amazing lotion. i love love love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried many lotions in my lifetime, and this is the one I&#x27;ve stuck with.  I&#x27;ve used this lotion year round for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some lotions are too greasy, others too watery, but this one is creamy and provides instant relief. I live in a dry climate and wash my hands frequently, so a good lotion is a must. Jergens Ultra Healing works great to moisturize the whole body.  It moisturizes my skin all day (except for my hands. I reapply it often after washing my hands).  This lotion normally works for me as a stand-alone moisturizer; although, during the winter months I supplement with a more intense, healing lotion for my hands (like Eucerin or Aquaphor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jergens is also very affordable.  As evidenced by my loyalty, this is the best every-day lotion I have found.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotions since when I was young and I am 45 years old now, I have a very sensitive skin and Jergens lotion is the only lotion that works for me. Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion keep my skin soft and smooth even during the coldest months of the year. I recommend this lotion for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The Ultra Healing lotion is exactly what I wanted for leathery skin from construction work, but I received another formula initially.  Company personnel were very accommodating and sent me the correct item later.</li>
    <li> Th bottle is not the one shown in the picture. Jergens has changed the packaging and it seems the product is a little different too.</li>
    <li> I had a fungus on my toe and elbow.The lotion . I will never useanything else  I recentlly has shingles and it work better then the medicine I was using.  I wll never use any thing else.  Thank you for a great product</li>
    <li> This lotion was actually recommended to me by my Podiatrist.  She went to a medical conference, where it was highly recommended for any skin issues.  I have eczema, and although it is much better than it used to be, I have not been able to totally get rid of it (YET).  This lotion is very comforting and only stings slightly and only for a minute on eczema skin.  (Many other lotions sting for awhile,.)  The container claims to heal and soften and I believe it does just that.  I have put it on overnight and am much better in the morning.  This particular bottle is a pump bottle.  (Note: I am referring to the picture shown right now. I have seen Amazon change pictures on my reviews.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says:  Extra Dry Skin Moisturizer, with Vitamin 3 (a blend of C, E, B5).  Penetrates through 5 layers of skin&#x27;s surface to start healing at the source.  Fast absorbing. . .goes deep beneath skin&#x27;s surface to lock in moisture for 24 hours of relief.  With continued use, it actually triples skin&#x27;s moisture content, healing dryness at the source to prevent its unwelcome return--dermatologist tested.&#x60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Podiatrist&#x27;s husband suffers with skin problems and she said it really helps him..  I told her that if I liked it, I would blast it out on Amazon for the thousands of folks who are suffering with skin problems.  Well, I am blasting. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW--I have paid up to $35 for a container of lotion.  This product is very reasonably priced for what it does.  It is also available in several sizes.  If you like to have lotion with you, also get the small tube for your purse or desk or pocket and refill it from the big bottle at home.</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with this product. Even our relatively mild winters in southern Georgia are rough on her hands. This lotion is really helping her hands.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It reallu works on dry skin and feels soft  not greasy but like an expensive lotion.  Just a hint of perfume so it smells reallu nice. Try it and you will agree it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrng wit jergens lol gd size for price</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I get very dry skin in the winter and Jergens helps keep my legs smooth and reduces the irritation from the dry skin. My grandmother used this brand for YEARS. Great product.</li>
    <li> Yet another amazing offering from Jergens!!!!</li>
    <li> keeps your skin moisturized and i love it whn i can buy a bigger bottle , life is good and will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite lotion, so much so that he refuses to use anything else.  I have a huge selection of lotions - some very, very expensive.
