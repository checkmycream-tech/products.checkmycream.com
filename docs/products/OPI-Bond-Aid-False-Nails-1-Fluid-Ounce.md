<li> This makes your nail polish last a really long time, but don&#x27;t use it each time you apply nail polish.</li>
<li> It helps keep the color on your nails and protects your nails from turning yellow if you wear reds too long.  </li>
<li> It does tend to dry the nails leaving white spots on some of theml</li>
<li> Although its the same ths for my convinence i ordered a single bottle.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a pity because I wished the big flask.</li>
<li> I think it does help with how long the gel polish lasts.</li>
<li> Hmm, it&#x27;s not doing what it is suppose to do I have lifting the very next day what a waste of money.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> It usually peels off in one piece and only stays on a day or so.</li>
<li> If anything I felt like it dried out my nails.</li>
<li> If your want your nails to stay on, IMHO, there is no better bonding agent on the market.</li>
<li> this was the missing link!</li>
<li> That said, it wasted my time because I needed the glue!</li>
<li> Not good for you at all.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s at least 2 weeks!</li>
<li> It does have a funky smell, but there are worse smelling products that do not work.</li>
<li> but I was lead to believe, from its description that it was to glue false nails on after they&#x27;d fallen off.  </li>
<li> This is a product you should be using if you are applying any type of false nails or Gelsih Polish.  </li>
<li> Stinks, but what doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t you just hate it when your polish chips.  </li>
<li> I have a horrible time getting polish to stay on my nails.</li>

    <li> I use this on real and it works great to make the polish on longer .  It does tend to dry the nails leaving white spots on some of theml</li>
    <li> This bonder is also used with gel nail products. I bought it and my nail color completely peeled off in its entirety the next day, nail after nail.  I thought it was a fluke but it happened two more times.  I ended up buying another brand at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It helps keep the color on your nails and protects your nails from turning yellow if you wear reds too long.  It does have a funky smell, but there are worse smelling products that do not work.</li>
    <li> I always use this product. It helps with adhesion</li>
    <li> this product does what it is supposed to do. let it fully dry before putting your acrylic gel or powder on first</li>
    <li> It may be good for what it&#x27;s manufactured for...but I was lead to believe, from its description that it was to glue false nails on after they&#x27;d fallen off.  Not so.  It&#x27;s for applying while they&#x27;re being put on. It&#x27;s not returnable but they did give me a refund with no problem.  That said, it wasted my time because I needed the glue!</li>
    <li> Gave as gift to my nail tech.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails with the gel polish and use this as the first step. I had used it for years before with my traditional polish that I did on my nails. It cleans and prepared the nail for the polish so that the basecoat and polish adhere to the nail properly.</li>
    <li> the overall product its great. good for acrylic nails, but i ordered 1 bottle containing 1oz but insted i recieved 2 bottles containing 5oz each. Although its the same ths for my convinence i ordered a single bottle. in this case i should of just ordered 2 bootle. Just disappionted on that</li>
    <li> What can I say about this one. Hmm, it&#x27;s not doing what it is suppose to do I have lifting the very next day what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This helps nail polish stick better/longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the manicurist used on my nails (not acrylic) and said that it helps to hold the polish on. I did not find that at all. If anything I felt like it dried out my nails.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to have for my OPI gel polishes. I think it does help with how long the gel polish lasts. And it&#x27;s at least 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> When I used to get my acrylic nails filled, my manicurist would use Bond-Aid on the exposed natural nail. I now always use it as a primer when I do my nails. I swear it makes polish last much longer.</li>
    <li> Je suis satisfaite de cette commande excepté le fait que j&#x27;ai reçu deux petits flacons au lieu d&#x27;un seul au format supérieur. C&#x27;est dommage car je souhaitais le grand flacon. Je vais m&#x27;adapter.  Merci.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied by this order except the fact that I received two small flasks instead of the only one in the upper size. It&#x27;s a pity because I wished the big flask. I am going to adapt myself. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use this to dehydrat the nails for almost every service.</li>
    <li> This really helps the polish stick to your nail.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery! Great product!</li>
    <li> Works well. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you wonder if something is really necessary to the process - turns out this was the missing link! Really helps my manicures last!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I have a horrible time getting polish to stay on my nails. It usually peels off in one piece and only stays on a day or so. This has totally solved that problem. I feel like it has also made my nails so much healthier. Now my polish stays in place, without peeling or chipping for 4 or 5 days! It&#x27;s a life saver!!</li>
    <li> This is a product you should be using if you are applying any type of false nails or Gelsih Polish.  It will increase the life of the nail polish.  My salon has used this product for years and decided to try it for my home use and I am glad I did.  I would definitely recommend this product..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you just hate it when your polish chips.  I do.  Well this product definitely makes it last longer.</li>
    <li> It works. Good size for the price. Met all of my expectations. I would purchase this product again, and recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> I have my manicurist use this on my nails before she applies Gel Polish and my manicure lasts for 3 weeks! When I don&#x27;t use it the manicure only last about 10 days before the gel begins to lift.</li>
    <li> This makes your nail polish last a really long time, but don&#x27;t use it each time you apply nail polish. It will dry out your nails and eventually they&#x27;ll break very easily. Not good for you at all.</li>
    <li> The salon used it on my nails so I got it for home and it works great!!! Stinks, but what doesn&#x27;t.  Smaller bottle than I thought it would be but it will last me forever. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It has worked well and at a great price.</li>
    <li> If your want your nails to stay on, IMHO, there is no better bonding agent on the market.</li>
