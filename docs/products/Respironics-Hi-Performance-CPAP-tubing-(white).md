### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>A very good buy!</li>
      <li>I have found it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>well make me very happy!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
      <li>Yes, its a great price for a replacement TUBE.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still a great price, I guess, but it is not what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my CPAP and it&#x27;s a great deal cheaper than going through the insurance company.</li>
      <li>Purchased at a great price.</li>
      <li>They did not send the \\&quot;bright white\\&quot; tubing described.  </li>
      <li>The tube is good, but buy elsewhere - Amazon, don&#x27;t deal with this guy.</li>
      <li>gets the job done, every bit as good as the one i paid $65 for..</li>
      <li>It still allows for movement in bed and retains a good air</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>NOT SO any more!</li>
      <li>I am content but gave the review four stars instead of five for not being totally honest about the product.  </li>
      <li>it seems too good to be true ...</li>
      <li>The Amazon rep said to just go to the company itself if I wanted to be sure of what I would get.</li>
      <li>Now I am able to sleep thru the night again.</li>
      <li>The company said they would never sell the performance tubing for that price because it costs so much more.  </li>
      <li>This is so much better</li>
      <li>I find myself sleeping all or most of the night with this one.  </li>
      <li>[I do still occasionally wake up around 5:00 am with discomfort, so the perfect CPAP mask has yet to be found]    </li>
      <li>Thanks for not only the good product but the excellent service!</li>
      <li>I have two hoses with the optional cozies, both hoses have condensation issues from the cool air conditioned room and warm humidified air from the machine.   </li>
      <li>Came in a timely manner, was exactly what I needed and of good quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good stuff, and essential to a good night&#x27;s sleep for me...</li>
      <li>I have found it to be tremendously more comfortable and easier to wear.  </li>
      <li>It fits fine and all that, and it works just fine, but I&#x27;d hoped for a more flexible tubing.</li>
      <li>The original hose that came with the cpap is much, much more flexable.</li>
      <li>Older reviews mention the hose was a good quality by respironics.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great price in any event, but as I use a lightweight nasal pillow I do not want the heavier grey hose.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, it shipped quickly and is definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>Or you roll over taking the slack out of the hose and get a mask full of water from the hose.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve found all my cpap supplies including masks, filters, and humidifiers on here at super savings.</li>
      <li>I obtained a quick refund agreement from the seller.</li>
      <li>It is much more flexible than the tubing I normally receive from my Medicare supplier.</li>
      <li>Okay, it&#x27;s correctly flexible, reasonably sturdy, fits perfectly into the CPAP device, doesn&#x27;t have any irritating parts</li>
      <li>But for me it was worth the money.  </li>
      <li>This is just what you need if your old CPAP tube is not holding onto the port very well any more.  </li>
      <li>but the price is very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>This hose is of the same quality as the one that came with my CPAP machine, but at a much better price than the OEM replacement.</li>
      <li>It is the exact tubing that you get at the homecare stores.</li>
      <li>I received the new, unwrapped product within one week and it is exactly as specified in their store!  </li>
      <li>used it for a week or two and eventually had to bite the bullet and get a real replacement..</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t ask how much it would have been otherwise.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s a 6&#x27; pipe with flexible joints, but the 1&#x27; sections between the bends don&#x27;t bend much themselves.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
      <li>And received in reasonable time.</li>
      <li>Like many other CPAP users, I have had difficulty using it because of discomfort with the masks.  </li>
      <li>The sideways orientation of the tube feels less obtrusive and the mask is overall much more comfortable to wear.  </li>
      <li>tube is easy to hang and dry.  </li>
      <li>As we all know that is untrue -- and even the seller&#x27;s own listing explains the advantages of the white \\&quot;performance\\&quot; hose over the grey \\&quot;standard\\&quot; hose -- I asked the seller to arrange for a return and refund.  </li>
      <li>B000IINATM Respironics 6&#x27; Tubing ORIGINAL RESPIRONICS PERFORMANCE TUBING - Grey]] for CPAP machine use.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for cpap users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Do NOT BUY if you are looking for the high end product.   </li>
      <li>However, the gray one I received seems to be exactly the same hose that originally came with my CPAP and that I&#x27;ve used for several years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend looking elsewhere to anyone looking for a new hose for cpap machine.</li>
      <li>Not a lot to say about these except that they work well with no air leaks (until the cat chews holes in them, which is why I needed to buy a new one).  </li>
      <li>This tubing is exactly the same as the one that came with the machine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not the first report of this error, so one can only assume the error is purposeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the exact same model and brand sold by healthcare facilities.</li>
      <li>I read the other reviews and thought surely they have fixed this by now,it&#x27;s been several months.</li>
      <li>At least it&#x27;s fine stiff consistency, that makes it useless for CPAP, would come in handy for what I&#x27;d be doing with it!   :)</li>
      <li>This tubing is marked original Respironics but it is not nearly the quality Respironics used several years ago.</li>
      <li>Respironics 6&#x27; tubing is less flexable than the original</li>
      <li>and so far it works quite well for me.  </li>
      <li>I am really surprised Amazon allows this to happen.  </li>
      <li>My old tube would not stay on the machine at night</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 1 star is, it was delivered fast.</li>
      <li>The old saying \\&quot;If</li>
      <li>This hose is cheap, somewhat smelly plastic, and too stiff to use in comfort on a cpap machine.</li>
      <li>I got the stiff cheap stuff.  </li>
      <li>The ends attach easily to the CPAP and the mask; I cannot say that for the usual tubing I have received.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product over the ten foot tubing.  </li>
      <li>Since I could not seem to get my medical experts to get a new hose as well as a mask when I needed it</li>
      <li>(I also do not want to go through the hassle of getting it replaced since my old hose finally developed a leak after several years of use.)  </li>
      <li>The complaints on this, by purchasers, go back some time, and I hope that whoever is responsible for the error is considerate enough of the customer and vendor/</li>
      <li>albeit the higher cost and EXTREME markups...</li>
      <li>The item is an exact replacement for my old hose and costs much less than the \\&quot;original\\&quot; product.</li>
      <li>I bought a spare tube here so that I could occasionally clean out my other six foot tube and let it dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After six months, it still naturally folds back to the bends that it had in the package.</li>
      <li>I frequently purchase replacement tubing since my cats occasionally chew on the tubing before I can stop them.</li>
      <li>so I waited a long time to get a new one.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this last month and it is not White or soft flex tubing as in photo.   </li>
      <li>local medical center charges $86 for this exact same thing (same brand and model!!!) of cpap hose.</li>
      <li>This is a grey cheap hose very stiff.</li>
      <li>although it does fit on a Respironics.&lt;br /&gt;The tube is STIFF, hardly flexible, and very irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> In other words, a simple item, simply but well made.</li>
<li> Both will wake you and then you have to swap out for the dry hose.</li>
<li> I dry them the next day using the machine without the humidifier, about half an hour on each hose with the mask on it</li>
<li> As others have posted here, this vendor shipped the grey stiff tubing, not the white flexible performance tubing.</li>
<li> With my doctor-supplied mask I would typically wake up at 1:30am and take off the mask -- obviously getting minimal value from it.  </li>
<li> and it is even harder to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I told her no thanks</li>
<li> Dark grey tubing was sent, comment on invoice said (NOT RESPIRONICS).</li>
<li> If you order this item, you will receive a stiff, grey hose manufactured by \\&quot;Amercian Bantex\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The tubing seems a little stiff, not as flexible as what I have previously had, but I suspect that it will last longer before getting any holes or punctures in it.</li>
<li> The only negative is the ridiculous shipping charge for such a lightweight package.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The CPAP tubing delivered is the \\&quot;dull grey\\&quot; tubing which the description specifically says is undesireable.  They did not send the \\&quot;bright white\\&quot; tubing described.  If this tubing fits the CPAP it&#x27;s still a great price, I guess, but it is not what I was looking for.  Of course, mistakes do happen, and I will ask for a replacement -- if it is provided I will update this review.    UPDATE:  After several days, and contact by me with Amazon, this seller finally sent me an email stating that the white hose was out of stock but that the grey hose was identical to the white once except for color.  As we all know that is untrue -- and even the seller&#x27;s own listing explains the advantages of the white \\&quot;performance\\&quot; hose over the grey \\&quot;standard\\&quot; hose -- I asked the seller to arrange for a return and refund.  In a second email he offered to send me a call slip for shipping.  So I believe that all is well that ends well.  It&#x27;s a great price in any event, but as I use a lightweight nasal pillow I do not want the heavier grey hose.  Seller should probably change the listing if they are just going to send whatever hose is on hand.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this seller.  I received the new, unwrapped product within one week and it is exactly as specified in their store!  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The product number is not what was mailed to me.  I got the stiff cheap stuff.  When I called the company, they said they have no control over what Amazon prints as the product description or what they send out.  Amazon just buys things from them and then resells it to customers.  The company said they would never sell the performance tubing for that price because it costs so much more.  When I called Amazon they said they can&#x27;t control what gets sent out.  They get products from different vendors and they just send out what they get.  They told me to just send it back.  If the product is NOT what is advertised why is Amazon trying to pass it off as something else.  The Amazon rep said to just go to the company itself if I wanted to be sure of what I would get.</li>
    <li> I purchased this last month and it is not White or soft flex tubing as in photo.   Do NOT BUY if you are looking for the high end product.   This is a grey cheap hose very stiff.</li>
    <li> I got this tubing to replace tubing that my cat bit through. Unfortunately, this tubing, although it looks similar, is not as flexible as what I had. After six months, it still naturally folds back to the bends that it had in the package. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s a 6&#x27; pipe with flexible joints, but the 1&#x27; sections between the bends don&#x27;t bend much themselves. It makes it a bit more awkward to get it to run smoothly behind a pillow. It fits fine and all that, and it works just fine, but I&#x27;d hoped for a more flexible tubing.</li>
    <li> As others have posted here, this vendor shipped the grey stiff tubing, not the white flexible performance tubing. Their initial email reply was terse, ending with \\&quot;Check the label its made by Respironics.\\&quot; The issue is not who manufactured it, but that it&#x27;s the non-performance tubing. They claim they are refunding my my money, but have not offered to replace with what they are supposed to be selling. The tube is good, but buy elsewhere - Amazon, don&#x27;t deal with this guy.</li>
    <li> Needed replacement tubing for my CPAP machine. Purchased at a great price. And received in reasonable time. What else could I ask for?</li>
    <li> Respironics 6&#x27; tubing is less flexable than the original but the price is very reasonable.  I ordered two for a quarter of the price of the medical supply house.  I will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> Works great on my CPAP and it&#x27;s a great deal cheaper than going through the insurance company. Thanks, Amazon. You guys are a life-saver!</li>
    <li> Older reviews mention the hose was a good quality by respironics. NOT SO any more! This hose is cheap, somewhat smelly plastic, and too stiff to use in comfort on a cpap machine. The bag it came in says its from American-Bantex. The original hose that came with the cpap is much, much more flexable. I tried this one night and got rid of it.   I&#x27;d recommend looking elsewhere to anyone looking for a new hose for cpap machine. Jim</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a Respironics 6&#x27; Tubing for my CPAP. It is much more flexible than the tubing I normally receive from my Medicare supplier. The ends attach easily to the CPAP and the mask; I cannot say that for the usual tubing I have received. The added flexibility keeps the mask in the proper position even when I shift sleeping positions during the night.     A very good buy!</li>
    <li> Item received was not item ordered.  I am really surprised Amazon allows this to happen.  From the comments it looks like it has been going on for years.  Amazon fulfilled an order for the seller Eva medical, but they didnt even check to see if the item bar codes match what is in the listing.   I ordered Respironics tubing, and received Bantex brand generic tubing.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely manner, was exactly what I needed and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased the [[ASIN:B000IINATM Respironics 6&#x27; Tubing ORIGINAL RESPIRONICS PERFORMANCE TUBING - Grey]] for CPAP machine use.  The tubing seems a little stiff, not as flexible as what I have previously had, but I suspect that it will last longer before getting any holes or punctures in it. The Amazon Review Creation Guidelines say that you aren&#x27;t supposed to post any specifics about price -- I found it to be the least expensive from EVA MEDICAL GROUPS LLC. I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> Yes, its a great price for a replacement TUBE.  NO...its not Respironics although it does fit on a Respironics.&lt;br /&gt;The tube is STIFF, hardly flexible, and very irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that the price is low and a LOT lower then what you would pay locally...but its a horrible item.&lt;br /&gt;The tube gets stiffer when the temperature drops, WINTER time....and it is even harder to use.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a week or two and eventually had to bite the bullet and get a real replacement..albeit the higher cost and EXTREME markups...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> gets the job done, every bit as good as the one i paid $65 for..</li>
    <li> This hose is of the same quality as the one that came with my CPAP machine, but at a much better price than the OEM replacement. The only negative is the ridiculous shipping charge for such a lightweight package. But what ya gonna do?</li>
    <li> Not a lot to say about these except that they work well with no air leaks (until the cat chews holes in them, which is why I needed to buy a new one).  Good stuff, and essential to a good night&#x27;s sleep for me...</li>
    <li> It is like totally tubular, dude.    Okay, it&#x27;s correctly flexible, reasonably sturdy, fits perfectly into the CPAP device, doesn&#x27;t have any irritating parts and I don&#x27;t think it even had any warnings about not using it internally or placing in dishwashers (hmmm...).    In other words, a simple item, simply but well made.</li>
    <li> Since I could not seem to get my medical experts to get a new hose as well as a mask when I needed it I decided I had to order one when the one I was using began to leak. Thanks for not only the good product but the excellent service!</li>
    <li> The item is an exact replacement for my old hose and costs much less than the \\&quot;original\\&quot; product. It is probably made by the same company as the OEM. Anyway, it shipped quickly and is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> If you order this item, you will receive a stiff, grey hose manufactured by \\&quot;Amercian Bantex\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey Amazon, wake up!  Remove this item, remove the supplier, or change the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the first report of this error, so one can only assume the error is purposeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE!  DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> The old saying \\&quot;If it seems too good to be true ... then it probably isn&#x27;t.\\&quot; applies here.     The item was NOT WHITE, as described in the listing.    The item was NOT RESPIRONICS brand described in the listing.    I obtained a quick refund agreement from the seller. They stated that this was a listing error and made the implication that it was an Amazon error.    The complaints on this, by purchasers, go back some time, and I hope that whoever is responsible for the error is considerate enough of the customer and vendor/listing services that the mistake is promptly eliminated.</li>
    <li> even though I have medicare it was cheeper to buy the tubing this way. It is the exact tubing that you get at the homecare stores. I know this because I used to work at a homcare store.</li>
    <li> This seller saved me 30.00 on this purchase.  When I went to the local Medical store I was asked if I was going to file this on my insurance.  I told the clerk no and she said then it would be 40.00, I didn&#x27;t ask how much it would have been otherwise.  I told her no thanks them walked out.  THIS IS WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES.         This tubing is exactly the same as the one that came with the machine.  My old tube would not stay on the machine at night so I was constantly putting it back on.  I knew that it was going to be expensive purchased locally so I waited a long time to get a new one.  Now I am able to sleep thru the night again.</li>
    <li> This tubing is marked original Respironics but it is not nearly the quality Respironics used several years ago. I would not reccomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Like many other CPAP users, I have had difficulty using it because of discomfort with the masks.  With my doctor-supplied mask I would typically wake up at 1:30am and take off the mask -- obviously getting minimal value from it.  Based upon previous reviews of this mask, I decided to give it a try.  I have found it to be tremendously more comfortable and easier to wear.  The sideways orientation of the tube feels less obtrusive and the mask is overall much more comfortable to wear.  I find myself sleeping all or most of the night with this one.  [I do still occasionally wake up around 5:00 am with discomfort, so the perfect CPAP mask has yet to be found]    If this were not a medical device it should cost about $18, so it&#x27;s too bad the price reflects medical mark-up.  But for me it was worth the money.  I recommend it to anyone having discomvort with their current over-the-head style mask.</li>
    <li> This seller is selling by fraud. I read the other reviews and thought surely they have fixed this by now,it&#x27;s been several months. WRONG!  Dark grey tubing was sent, comment on invoice said (NOT RESPIRONICS). If you order Respironics that is what you should be sent, instead this seller is deliberately sending a cheaper item, made in China, with even a different item #.  AMAZON you need to get rid of this seller. This is FRAUD!! The only reason I gave it 1 star is, it was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> The hose arrived from Amazon in the DC area 2 days after placing the order.  On 5/25/11 I too did not receive the \\&quot;white\\&quot; one.  However, the gray one I received seems to be exactly the same hose that originally came with my CPAP and that I&#x27;ve used for several years.  I am content but gave the review four stars instead of five for not being totally honest about the product.  (I also do not want to go through the hassle of getting it replaced since my old hose finally developed a leak after several years of use.)  As several other reviewers have noted, this is WAY less expensive than my copay would have been under insurance.</li>
    <li> This is just what you need if your old CPAP tube is not holding onto the port very well any more.  Don&#x27;t go to a local place - I called one, and they wanted forty dollars for it.  That&#x27;s insane!</li>
    <li> This is the exact same model and brand sold by healthcare facilities. I have found it works wonderfully. I highly recommend this for cpap users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local medical center charges $86 for this exact same thing (same brand and model!!!) of cpap hose. Even after my insurance pays for 1/2 I still pay $43. This is so much better and I don&#x27;t have to fight with my insurance company! The markup from the healthcare facilities is OUTRAGEOUS!!! I will buy this hose from here from now on. In fact, I&#x27;ve found all my cpap supplies including masks, filters, and humidifiers on here at super savings. Saving money &amp; sleeping well make me very happy!!!</li>
    <li> I frequently purchase replacement tubing since my cats occasionally chew on the tubing before I can stop them. The price is less than what I pay at the suppliers through my insurance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to take the stiff crap they sent me and, well, let&#x27;s just say that these scumbags would never have a problem with constipation after I&#x27;m done \\&quot;placing\\&quot; it.  At least it&#x27;s fine stiff consistency, that makes it useless for CPAP, would come in handy for what I&#x27;d be doing with it!   :)</li>
    <li> I have two hoses with the optional cozies, both hoses have condensation issues from the cool air conditioned room and warm humidified air from the machine.   Sometimes the buildup of moisture in the low part of the hose, #1 will make a gurgling noise that will wake you. #2 Or you roll over taking the slack out of the hose and get a mask full of water from the hose.  Both will wake you and then you have to swap out for the dry hose. I dry them the next day using the machine without the humidifier, about half an hour on each hose with the mask on it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product over the ten foot tubing.  It still allows for movement in bed and retains a good air pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for several weeks and so far it works quite well for me.  I bought a spare tube here so that I could occasionally clean out my other six foot tube and let it dry completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tube is easy to hang and dry.  It takes at least 12 hours to dry.</li>
