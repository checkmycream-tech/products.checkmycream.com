### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It smells great, like all their products, and moisturizes like a dream!  </li>
      <li>Vivexin IS a great product, because hyaluronic acid is a great product.</li>
      <li>At 58, my eyes are looking good</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel so good.  </li>
      <li>Love Vivexin!</li>
      <li>I used the rest of it up as a face lotion, which I really liked for face lotion, but not for over a dollar per pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried four products, including this one, each for two weeks, 1x per day after face wash at bedtime.</li>
      <li>I liked the texture and felt the lines under my eyes were softened.  </li>
      <li>and they were quite nice and told me to keep trying it</li>
      <li>and I said I do not want them sending me more without my permission.  </li>
      <li>pricing is better and you are not locked into a revolving purchase thing.</li>
      <li>Maybe I have to use longer to work better.</li>
      <li>I had no qualms about doing this, but told her to make sure from now on that this is in writing.  </li>
      <li>Check the product info for more on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>immediately, I noticed reduced puffiness, increased firmness, and much more even tone.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I have tried many costly ones and have never found one that worked.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad, not my favorite.</li>
      <li>The skin under my eyes has never ever felt SO SMOOTH and wrinkle free.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m relieved to have found something that doesn&#x27;t break the bank and genuinely delivers results.</li>
      <li>I like how it feels and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>A silky smooth translucent gel.</li>
      <li>I love this eye gel, it really tightens the eye area and reduces fine lines.</li>
      <li>I am not one to overuse products, I just think there isn&#x27;t a full months supply in the bottle.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more in the future, for sure.</li>
      <li>The scent is a little too strong, but still pleasant and floral.</li>
      <li>Moderately effective  -definitely</li>
      <li>It soaks in super fast and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle and felt like nothing at all, so I wore this one under makeup during the day.</li>
      <li>sure enough, Vivexin is hyaluronic acid.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually order from \\&quot;popup ads\\&quot;, but this time I did with surprisingly good results.</li>
      <li>One pump gel goes a very long way, so I ended up smearing most of it on my face.</li>
      <li>It says a 1 month supply but really is about 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Elemis Absolute Eye Mask, 1.0 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;The cream is like a very light scrub with little microbeads.</li>
      <li>its nice if you have sensitive skin too, works just as well or better as some of the harsher expensive ones from department stores</li>
      <li>I used this eye gel exactly as directed and saw not a bit of difference around or even near my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Which be nice to have it in a small jar.</li>
      <li>They are being sold at high prices</li>
      <li>So be careful of this type of trial offer and read the fine print.  </li>
      <li>Directions were only on the outside of the bottle that could barely be read with a very strong magnifying glass.</li>
      <li>The product did make my skin soft but didn&#x27;t see much removal of lines and</li>
      <li>Left my skin feeling very smooth, and very moisturized at first, but didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
      <li>I tried the one month trial and, on the down low, they charged me for 2 more bottles and sent them to me.  </li>
      <li>This one was my clear winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 74 yrs old and everyone comments on my complexion and lack of wrinkles.</li>
      <li>The lovely scent is clean, soapy, and very faint.</li>
      <li>The results are lasting so far.  </li>
      <li>Look at the ingredients on Vivexin, buy pure hyaluronic acid for less on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Vivexin is hyaluronic acid in a fancy bottle with far less product than you get if you buy the pure hyaluronic acid serum on Amazon for far less money.</li>

    <li> Do not order the trial. It is a scam........not</li>
    <li> Used to get this from my dermatologist, works really well, but was always out of stock and pretty expensive at their pricing. its nice if you have sensitive skin too, works just as well or better as some of the harsher expensive ones from department stores</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this from the Vivexin site, but will be using Amazon in the future...pricing is better and you are not locked into a revolving purchase thing. I tried this on a whim because I was concerned about wrinkles around my brow and under my eye. I don&#x27;t usually order from \\&quot;popup ads\\&quot;, but this time I did with surprisingly good results. At 58, my eyes are looking good and I&#x27;m relieved to have found something that doesn&#x27;t break the bank and genuinely delivers results. The peptides, maybe?</li>
    <li> I like how it feels and goes on smoothly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the pump bottle. A lot of the product gets left in it. Which be nice to have it in a small jar.</li>
    <li> Love Vivexin! This is a product that actually works like it&#x27;s supposed to. I will buy it again, &amp; recommend it.</li>
    <li> I liked the texture and felt the lines under my eyes were softened.  The gel did nothing to reduce the dark circles which was my reason for buying this product. Directions were only on the outside of the bottle that could barely be read with a very strong magnifying glass.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel so good.  I use it as directed.  Will be ordering more in the future, for sure.</li>
    <li> I tried the one month trial and, on the down low, they charged me for 2 more bottles and sent them to me.  I did not order them, nor did I authorize the charge.  I am made as a hatter!  Oder with caution.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel, it really tightens the eye area and reduces fine lines. It says a 1 month supply but really is about 2 weeks. I am not one to overuse products, I just think there isn&#x27;t a full months supply in the bottle. I will re order!</li>
    <li> I ordered this trial for the bagginess beneath my eyes.  I have tried many costly ones and have never found one that worked.  I thought I would give this one a try.  It did nothing for me and I doubt there is anything out there that would work.&lt;br /&gt;I called long before the due date of letting them know and they were quite nice and told me to keep trying it and I said I do not want them sending me more without my permission.  I was then told to return the remaining. Where did it tell me to do that - such a bother.  The woman I spoke with said it is written there that it must be returned.  I had three pages printed out from their site and found nothing saying that.  Nor did the woaman I ordered from mention this.  I had no qualms about doing this, but told her to make sure from now on that this is in writing.  She insisted it was.  I told her to please show me where since I had all of the pages printed out in front of me.  She took a while to read it and then said - let me speak to my manager.  Came back and said - you do not have to return the unused portion.  I wish this had worked for me, but it did not.  So be careful of this type of trial offer and read the fine print.  And do not let them get away with something that is not in their offer.</li>
    <li> Disappointed!  This was a product advertised with another one of  Vitamin C, under Dr Oz.  Later when I went back to the site, I found different product names, using DrOz name as well.  May be a scam...</li>
    <li> Have you ever used Vivexin and thought, I wish I could afford to use it all over my face? Well, you can. Vivexin is hyaluronic acid in a fancy bottle with far less product than you get if you buy the pure hyaluronic acid serum on Amazon for far less money. I used Vivexin for a couple months and when I used hyaluronic acid I thought, hmm. That feels just like Vivexin. So I looked at the ingredients on the bottle and, sure enough, Vivexin is hyaluronic acid. Look at the ingredients on Vivexin, buy pure hyaluronic acid for less on Amazon. Vivexin IS a great product, because hyaluronic acid is a great product.</li>
    <li> This product actually works.  The results are lasting so far.  I do use it minimally morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It is a dishonest business!</li>
    <li> The product did make my skin soft but didn&#x27;t see much removal of lines and&lt;br /&gt;wrinkles.  Maybe I have to use longer to work better.</li>
    <li> A silky smooth translucent gel. The scent is a little too strong, but still pleasant and floral. Left my skin feeling very smooth, and very moisturized at first, but didn&#x27;t last long enough. One pump gel goes a very long way, so I ended up smearing most of it on my face. Not intense enough for my dry, baggy under-eye skin. I used the rest of it up as a face lotion, which I really liked for face lotion, but not for over a dollar per pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried four products, including this one, each for two weeks, 1x per day after face wash at bedtime. Here are the other three I tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005PTZWUY L&#x27;Occitane Immortelle Eye Balm, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately, I noticed reduced puffiness, increased firmness, and much more even tone. It smells great, like all their products, and moisturizes like a dream!  The skin under my eyes has never ever felt SO SMOOTH and wrinkle free. I started using it on a couple other spots on my face because it minimizes wrinkles so well. Dark circles appeared lessened because of improved hydration, etc.  This one was my clear winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0087CRJDO Womens Eye Contour Serum]]&lt;br /&gt;Bright white and thicker cream has virtually zero scent. It is very gentle and felt like nothing at all, so I wore this one under makeup during the day. It soaks in super fast and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but lasts for hours. Definitely helped reduce puffiness. Maybe a bit on the dark circles, too.  Second choice. I&#x27;d buy this one again! Contains: eyeliss and haloxyl. Check the product info for more on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000KQX7M2 Elemis Absolute Eye Mask, 1.0 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;The cream is like a very light scrub with little microbeads. The lovely scent is clean, soapy, and very faint. Moderately effective  -definitely with the puffiness-  but fell short in long run.  And it burned my eyes a little. Must wash off after 10 mins, it leaves a sticky film. Not a bad, not my favorite.</li>
    <li> ONLY LASER OR A FACE LIFT WILL GET THE RESULTS THEY FALSELY ADVERTISE. DURING OUR SLOWED ECONOMY PLEASE PLEASE SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS. $$$$$$$$$$$$</li>
    <li> I used this eye gel exactly as directed and saw not a bit of difference around or even near my eyes.  I do not believe any of these so call creams work for lines or help you to look younger.  They are being sold at high prices just so you think it is doing the job.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vivexin eye gel for over a year. I LOVE it. I&#x27;m 74 yrs old and everyone comments on my complexion and lack of wrinkles. I use the gel under my eyes twice a day. Just a drop goes a long way. I&#x27;m ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;Lynn</li>
