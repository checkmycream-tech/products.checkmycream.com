### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>the leave in conditioner is awesome!</li>
      <li>but it works great for my curls!</li>
      <li>Awesome product for girls with frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo has been the best I&#x27;ve found for my hair type.</li>
      <li>I use this every time I wash my hair, its great!</li>
      <li>Best hair product EVER!</li>
      <li>it work great with my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
      <li>Great for biracial curls.  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>No stripping or dulling, and my curls look great.</li>
      <li>I loved Wen for 2 years until the day I tried this.</li>
      <li>But both are good products.</li>
      <li>This company is fantastic and makes wonderful products.</li>
      <li>So far have been very happy with this and the leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>I was not in love with this product.</li>
      <li>to my surpise I love it.</li>
      <li>My children and I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have fine, but curly/wavy hair, which can make finding the right shampoo very challenging.  </li>
      <li>Works really well on my daughters hair, my wife have been searching for while for a good product.</li>
      <li>GOOD SHAMPOO, BUT COST TO MUCH.</li>
      <li>Has a lovely aroma, smooth creamy texture, and rinses out easy.</li>
      <li>so I decided to give the sulfate free shampoo a try.  </li>
      <li>Works great would recommend to anyone one who wants gentle products without the greasy weight on your hair</li>
      <li>If you try it and love it, i would recommend buying the large size bottle.</li>
      <li>We found it in the store, but this is such a good deal</li>
      <li>I have tried the regular and sulfate free shampoos and prefer the sulfate free because it helps keep more of the natural oils in my hair.</li>
      <li>The regular Mixed Chicks shampoo doesn&#x27;t have these chemicals and is actually more gentle and nice to my hair and skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have baby fine naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I guess this is okay, but will purchase the mixed chicks conditioner and see how the products work together.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t need much -- lasts longer in the purchasing dept!  </li>
      <li>These preservatives are now used in larger concentrations than they once were and are found in MANY shampoos, conditioners, hair products, liquid soaps, etc etc.  </li>
      <li>Love the shampoo and the deep conditioner</li>
      <li>&quot; feeling (which is your hair being stripped of its natural moisture), but it will have fantastic softness and bounce, with plenty of body and wave/curl.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, I love what Mixed Chicks products are about and even though I&#x27;m a white girl with lots of fine wavy/curly hair I can appreciate haircare that caters to curls.  </li>
      <li>I have to use a large amount of it</li>
      <li>Really like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>Note, it won&#x27;t lather up as much as a sulfate shampoo nor will you have that \\&quot;squeaky-clean\\</li>
      <li>the conditioner takes forever to wash out and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t really help anything.</li>
      <li>it coats my hair and takes a whole week to get out after shampooing and rinsing and shampooing and rinsing and repeat and repeat.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
      <li>It takes way too much product for me to use.</li>
      <li>Smells good and is quite thick --</li>
      <li>But this sulfate free version of their shampoo falls flat, just like my hair after I tried it.</li>
      <li>It left my hair feeling clean but not stripped of all</li>
      <li>I have been using the Mixed Chicks line of products for a few months now and the difference in my hair is amazing!</li>
      <li>I love the Mixed Chicks regular shampoo and Leave-In Conditioner</li>
      <li>I have loose curls, my hair is fine and color treated, so it needs moisture but easily gets weighed down.</li>
      <li>The next day I&#x27;ll lightly comb out hair and it is full and fluffy.</li>
      <li>I like how it lathers up, other sulfate free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This is my new go to product line and</li>
      <li>I have black hair texture and this seems to leave my hair feeling lighter and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>i thought it was suppose to be something special because of the price i spent for both products</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but every time I wash my hair with this shampoo my hair feels dry and in need of a really good conditioning.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft after drying anyway; but this has it blow-away soft!  </li>
      <li>Although it is sulfate free, it actually lathers quite a bit, especially on the second wash.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s natural oils.  </li>
      <li>It keeps the curls manageable and soft.</li>
      <li>Works well on my natural hair, moisturizes well</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not what its cracked up to be by far.</li>
      <li>But even without the keratin treatment these products help my long red &#x27;viking&#x27; curls stay in place instead of turning into a huge red Afro (a-la CarrotTop).</li>
      <li>This is one of two products I&#x27;ve found that really cleanses well without damaging or weighing down fine wavy hair types (the other is JessiCurl).  </li>
      <li>I am a Ginger, but I have really coarse, thick, curly, frizzy hair that has been unmanageable most of my life.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I seem to have a sensitivity or an allergy to them and have experienced bad eczema on my hands after using different things that contain them.  </li>
      <li>in my hair was SO dry and flat that it looked completely lifeless.  </li>

    <li> I switched from Wen to Mixed Chicks! I loved Wen for 2 years until the day I tried this. this is a must have for Multiracial hair! My hair is softer, stronger, and shinier. Although it is sulfate free, it actually lathers quite a bit, especially on the second wash. I have no complaints other than the size of the bottle. If you try it and love it, i would recommend buying the large size bottle.</li>
    <li> some thing I always use</li>
    <li> I brought this shampoo and conditioner for my mother and I and it&#x27;s not what its cracked up to be by far. i thought it was suppose to be something special because of the price i spent for both products but i wish i hadnt bought it. the conditioner takes forever to wash out and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t really help anything. it&#x27;s just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for girls with frizzy hair. It keeps the curls manageable and soft.</li>
    <li> Works well on my natural hair, moisturizes well and I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and the deep conditioner</li>
    <li> ugh makes my hair feel dull and heavy and full of product. it coats my hair and takes a whole week to get out after shampooing and rinsing and shampooing and rinsing and repeat and repeat. waste of money</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo. Has a lovely aroma, smooth creamy texture, and rinses out easy. I have black hair texture and this seems to leave my hair feeling lighter and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Best hair product EVER!</li>

    <li> A little expensive but it works great for my curls!</li>
    <li> I love the Mixed Chicks regular shampoo and Leave-In Conditioner so I decided to give the sulfate free shampoo a try.  Unfortunately, even when I used it with the leave-in my hair was SO dry and flat that it looked completely lifeless.  I also had problems with the skin on my scalp and hands getting itchy and when I read the ingredients I saw why:  There is this widely used preservative called METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE and another related one that are both known for being irritating to many people.  These preservatives are now used in larger concentrations than they once were and are found in MANY shampoos, conditioners, hair products, liquid soaps, etc etc.  Anyway, I seem to have a sensitivity or an allergy to them and have experienced bad eczema on my hands after using different things that contain them.  The regular Mixed Chicks shampoo doesn&#x27;t have these chemicals and is actually more gentle and nice to my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I love what Mixed Chicks products are about and even though I&#x27;m a white girl with lots of fine wavy/curly hair I can appreciate haircare that caters to curls.  But this sulfate free version of their shampoo falls flat, just like my hair after I tried it.</li>
    <li> I seen this on a youtube video and wanted to try, but didn&#x27;t want to pay alot and not like it. to my surpise I love it.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much. Works great would recommend to anyone one who wants gentle products without the greasy weight on your hair</li>
    <li> Great product.  Low quantity.</li>
    <li> GOOD SHAMPOO, BUT COST TO MUCH.</li>
    <li> it work great with my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> Not a mixed chick but this is a staple for my entire household.  My children and I love this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is soft after drying anyway; but this has it blow-away soft!  Smells good and is quite thick -- don&#x27;t need much -- lasts longer in the purchasing dept!  If I don&#x27;t comb out hair when dry, I have curls and waves that make my hair look like I cut it.  The next day I&#x27;ll lightly comb out hair and it is full and fluffy.</li>
    <li> I was not in love with this product. It takes way too much product for me to use. I only got 4 hair washing from this bottle.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair. This shampoo dries it. It may be sulfate free but the other ingredients in it are not good for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine naturally curly hair. So far have been very happy with this and the leave in conditioner. Haven&#x27;t had to use products at all since I&#x27;ve been using these. Will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I like how it lathers up, other sulfate free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t. It left my hair feeling clean but not stripped of all it&#x27;s natural oils.  This is my new go to product line and the leave in conditioner is awesome!</li>
    <li> I have to use a large amount of it and I feel like my dry, coarse hair, which I typically wash every other day is already dirty the next day. Comparative to L&#x27;Oreal which is cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great for biracial curls.  This company is fantastic and makes wonderful products.</li>
    <li> I have fine, but curly/wavy hair, which can make finding the right shampoo very challenging.  Too moisturizing, and my hair goes completely flat and loses all its body and curl.  However, everything I&#x27;ve tried non-curly specific leaves my hair damaged and dried out.  Enter Mixed Chicks sulfate-free shampoo!  This is one of two products I&#x27;ve found that really cleanses well without damaging or weighing down fine wavy hair types (the other is JessiCurl).  I definitely recommend the sulfate-free version though, as even the regular one can be a bit drying.  Note, it won&#x27;t lather up as much as a sulfate shampoo nor will you have that \\&quot;squeaky-clean\\&quot; feeling (which is your hair being stripped of its natural moisture), but it will have fantastic softness and bounce, with plenty of body and wave/curl.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works really well on my daughters hair, my wife have been searching for while for a good product. We found it in the store, but this is such a good deal</li>
    <li> Finally a product that works! I am a Ginger, but I have really coarse, thick, curly, frizzy hair that has been unmanageable most of my life. Products that are targeted towards typical thin, straight, &#x27;white&#x27; hair. Only make mine frizzier. I have been using the Mixed Chicks line of products for a few months now and the difference in my hair is amazing! Its still a bit frizzy, so I do a keratin treatment at home every few months. But even without the keratin treatment these products help my long red &#x27;viking&#x27; curls stay in place instead of turning into a huge red Afro (a-la CarrotTop). Thank you Mixed Chicks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. I have tried the regular and sulfate free shampoos and prefer the sulfate free because it helps keep more of the natural oils in my hair. But both are good products. The leave-in conditioner is a MUST HAVE life changing product!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have been recommended to try shampoo without sulfates in them (sulfates dry your hair out and are harsh) so I decided to give this shampoo a try. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but every time I wash my hair with this shampoo my hair feels dry and in need of a really good conditioning. I guess this is okay, but will purchase the mixed chicks conditioner and see how the products work together.</li>
