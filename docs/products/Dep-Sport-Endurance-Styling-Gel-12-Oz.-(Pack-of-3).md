      <li>Visually, the one purchased in the store has those \\&quot;air-bubbles\\&quot; while THIS one is completely free of air-bubbles.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and it helps keep away unwanted curls and frizzy hair in humidity while it also gives me that extra hold that I need for my new style.[[ASIN:</li>

    <li> Great product.  I am usually pretty active, so I appreciate that this product does not cause irritation if my head sweats. I also like the consistency of product...not too runny or too pasty.</li>
    <li> The price was right for a product I use everyday. I received the gel in a very short period of time and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I bought it to replace Potion 9 which is harder to find now. This is priced right and does not make your hair sticky.</li>
    <li> Can I really be the first person to review this product?  It&#x27;s been out forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, holds well, not sticky, not slimy, wet look or dry look, washes away easily.  Not much else to say.  Oh yeah, it&#x27;s CHEAP!

    <li> Woo hoo dep gel. great for curly hair, no alcohol. Last all day</li>
    <li> Made many points  with my commanding Officer (wife) she could not find this product anymore so Amazon saved the marriage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this gel for years when traveling.  It works great.  I always bought it in small tubes that were travel size.  It was so good that I bought more for travel and a big size for home.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Used this for years good product</li>
    <li> This is the only gel that will work on my fine hair to control it without weighing it down too much! Great product!</li>
    <li> I have been a long-time gel user, and I love that this actually sells as a 3-pack. I won&#x27;t have to buy any more gel for at least a few months. I have always been a fan of this particular brand, because it provides great hold without having to create a hardened shell on my head. My co-workers once tried to gel their hair back the way I usually do, and none of their hairstyles held up the mine usually does :)</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair look dull and greasy.  I threw it out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hair Gel... What can I say</li>
    <li> Good product to keep hair in place after washing</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. I HAVE STRAIGHT HAIR SO AFTER WASHING MY HAIR I USE DEP.  I LET IT DRY. USE CURLING IRON AND I STYLE MY HAIR .  LASTS ALL DAY AND I HAVE EVEN HAD THE CURLS LAST TWO DAYS .  I HAVE HAD TROUBLE TRYING TO FIND IT IN LOCAL STORES WASTING TIME AND GAS LOOKING FOR IT.  THANKS AMAZON. I HAVE CURLS AGAIN! 😁</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  We have been unable to find it locally, so we ordered it online.  The process was easy and product was delivered in good condition in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I used Suave hair gel for years, but decided to try the Dep hair gel and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Gives you that wet look w/out looking like you have 80&#x27;s Jerry curl&#x27;s.  Quick delivery:)</li>
    <li> This stuff is old school and works great.</li>
    <li> Its a lot of gel, sure, but I think I ordered this last year and here I am, 11 months later. As for the product, its one of the strongest gels out there and it dries to a stiff, hard crunchy coating and it will hold your hair in just about any position you want (yeah your mohawk should be fine). If a spike goes down, simply re-wet and re-style..albeit a bit weaker..:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On that note (why not a perfect 5 stars), if anyone attempts to rub your hair, it will crunch or break the style and if they fan your hair a lot, the gel will flake..so like Fonzi, \\&quot;hey!! whoa! don&#x27;t touch the hair..\\&quot; /comb /comb</li>
    <li> Over the years I have enjoyed many Dep hair products. They work for me. Unfortunately, some of the products have been discontinued. This past summer I was very happy to find the Dep Sport Endurance Styling Gel. My hair is fine and it helps keep away unwanted curls and frizzy hair in humidity while it also gives me that extra hold that I need for my new style.[[ASIN:B0009R360U Dep Sport Endurance Gel, Intense Hold, Level 11, 12 oz]]</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is a \\&quot;copy cat\\&quot; seller claiming to be \\&quot;Dep,\\&quot; but it is NOT the same product you are able to purchase from stores. I&#x27;ve used Dep my entire life and always purchased them in the store. I decided recently to buy it online for the first time and they arrived promptly in the mail. I didn&#x27;t notice anything out of the ordinary when it came out of the box, but on first use I immediately noticed something different. The texture and viscosity are completely different. Upon comparing the one I purchased from the store vs THIS one, I noticed they are completely different. Visually, the one purchased in the store has those \\&quot;air-bubbles\\&quot; while THIS one is completely free of air-bubbles. When actually applying the product-- THIS one is much more runny and watered down while the one purchased from the store is thick and consistent. I need to use a lot more of THIS one and it also takes much longer to dry. I&#x27;ve taken pictures to compare both products seen here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://imageshack.com/a/img196/4210/zdbm.jpg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one on the left is the false product while the one on the right is the true product purchased from the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware. This opened my eyes to not always be so comfortable buying things online. This may be a knock off company trying to use the name and who knows what formula they are using for this gel.</li>
    <li> This is the only gel my husband will use.</li>
    <li> Only stuff my hubby will use!  Does not leave hair sticky or stiff!</li>
    <li> Great price. I use this product all the time so the less expensive the better. the price was certainly right thank you</li>
    <li> If you are looking for that spiky or bed head look this works great!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. My hair is light and this provides the hold I need. It&#x27;s never stiff and heavy. I&#x27;ve tried just about ever thing out there and this is the only one that works for me. I don&#x27;t know if it has been discontinued by the manufacturer, but I can no longer find it in retail stores. Amazon to the rescue again!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Dep for years. We like this product.</li>
    <li> I am interested in changing my hair style and so I purchased Dep Sport Edurance Gel. I have used Dep products in the past for hair styling and they provided me the necessary control I needed. It is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve results. And the added bonus of getting a three pack at a price that cannot be matched by any stores in my area.</li>
    <li> The gel works great, and I&#x27;m sure it will go bad before I can use it all.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. My hair is somewhere between curly and wavy and a dap of Dep brings out the curl and body and keeps it from flattening out.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to be able to purchase a 3 pack of the Dep hair gel. It was also a plus that I saved some money.  I&#x27;ll be sure to order this again the next time I start to run again.</li>
