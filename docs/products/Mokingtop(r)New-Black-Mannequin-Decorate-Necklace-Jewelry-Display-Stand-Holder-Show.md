      <li>perfect for necklaces...</li>
      <li>Very nice product and the perfect small size displays the necklace is it for perfectly.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>While it is cute it is NOT practical for the display of necklaces.</li>
      <li>I may have not read the fine print</li>
      <li>Barbie&#x27;s necklaces would just about fit it.</li>
      <li>I laughed out loud when I saw that is</li>
      <li>perfect size for my small display case.</li>
      <li>Leans to the right, barely stands on its own let alone put a piece of jewelry on it!</li>
      <li>It was not what I wanted and wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
      <li>It was not what I wanted and wasn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
      <li>but when you get it out of the package you will notice that the photo is most likely that of a bracelet and NOT a necklace.</li>
      <li>My tip to any buyer is to really check the measurements before making the purchase.</li>
      <li>was about three inches high!</li>

    <li> perfect for necklaces...Love it</li>
    <li> I should of checked dimensions. Fits bracelets.</li>
    <li> Very small and a piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Leans to the right, barely stands on its own let alone put a piece of jewelry on it! I gave 1 star only because I had to.</li>
    <li> Not as heavy as i thought it would have been. Necklaces make it fall over</li>
    <li> I may have not read the fine print but this item is TINY! It fits in my palm, no use.</li>
    <li> smaller than I thought but my fault for not realizing.</li>

    <li> Very small....definitely not what I expected based on the measurement and height stated in the description. Do not buy unless you really want a small jewelry holder</li>
    <li> This is the tiniest display mannequin ever. Barbie&#x27;s necklaces would just about fit it. My tip to any buyer is to really check the measurements before making the purchase. The picture of the mannequin shows supposedly a necklace but when you get it out of the package you will notice that the photo is most likely that of a bracelet and NOT a necklace. While it is cute it is NOT practical for the display of necklaces.</li>
