      <li>and I am glad I picked it that one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know many people who wear this scent, which to me adds to the appeal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I prefer more unisex-ish types of scents that are kind of on the sweet side.</li>
      <li>This was one of my best purchases in a long time.</li>
      <li>wow, this smells great.  </li>
      <li>I would really recommend you try a sample at the mall first before buying it, but I love this one and think it is a great value here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, Terre d&#x27;Hermes is something unique, powerful, classy, and very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure to experience!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a genuine product.  </li>
      <li>Decided to order some and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>First of all, make sure Amazon is listed as the seller.  </li>
      <li>Guys, this one is special.  </li>
      <li>will certainly get more when this is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He enjoyed it so much</li>
      <li>I would also say this scent is very refined and sophisticated.  </li>
      <li>It is probably best suited for gentlemen in their late 20&#x27;s and up.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s the only way to know for sure that you&#x27;re getting the authentic fragrance.  </li>
      <li>but they quickly retreat to the background.  </li>
      <li>TdH is highly regarded on most fragrance forums.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied, I use this only for occasion.</li>
      <li>If it is a new girlfriend I would go with something safe like Bleu de Chanel or Yves Saint Laurent l&#x27;homme or la nuit de l&#x27;homme or even Dolce &amp; Gabbana</li>
      <li>I first encountered this cologne in 2005 and (thank goodness!)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells great, but using it everyday made me nauseous.</li>
      <li>The sprayer is consistent and powerful.  </li>
      <li>but it was much appreciated!)</li>
      <li>I really like my Terre D&#x27;Hermes!</li>
      <li>If you go to SAKS the price is much higher.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a safe work cologne as long as you don&#x27;t overdo it.  </li>
      <li>It has staying power and pretty decent projection</li>
      <li>so you really don&#x27;t want to overdo it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really almost like a campfire.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get that so much.  </li>
      <li>;, the one that you can smell across the office wearing too much cologne.  </li>
      <li>This has a nice masculine fragrance, not sweet or overpowering.</li>
      <li>I know that may sound weird, but it smells amazing when it&#x27;s on your skin.</li>
      <li>I have used many &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; colognes such as Givenchy Play, Azzaro Chrome, Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, Paco Rabanne 1 Million, and even the famed Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male.</li>
      <li>It smell good but dont last just a few n e will disapear</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly light, but remains pleasing and masculine for a long time.</li>
      <li>it will make complete strangers stop you on the street and ask you what cologne you have on.  </li>
      <li>so I was worried about it being counterfeit, but since it shipped directly from Amazon and researched counterfeit vs. legit bottles, I came to the conclusion that this bottle is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As far as a date cologne?  </li>
      <li>The 3.3oz bottle was about $40 cheaper on Amazon than at any of the major dept. stores!</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes and smell different from when i tried a sample at Nordstrom a few weeks ago.  </li>
      <li>Men generally seem to like this fragrance.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It smell good but dont last just a few n e will disapear</li>
    <li> I have used many &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; colognes such as Givenchy Play, Azzaro Chrome, Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, Paco Rabanne 1 Million, and even the famed Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male. None of them come close to the smell of Terre D&#x27;Hermes. I wore this to work and out on the town in the same day and got attention from women of all ages. You can spray two sprays on your chest and one on the neck and it will last you at least 8 hours, but probably 10-12. The scent could be described like this: Imagine taking an orange and throwing it in a campfire for 10 seconds and then smashing it into the woody soil around the fire with a hammer. I know that may sound weird, but it smells amazing when it&#x27;s on your skin. Definitely give this a try if you&#x27;ve never smelled it before. The product arrived quickly and in great condition as well. This was one of my best purchases in a long time.</li>
    <li> Guys, this one is special.  I smelled a sample at Nordstom and got online and ordered this that same day.  First of all, make sure Amazon is listed as the seller.  With cologne that&#x27;s the only way to know for sure that you&#x27;re getting the authentic fragrance.  Terre d&#x27;Hermes smells great...plain and simple.  It comes off very clean and has a warm and pleasant finish.  I smell mostly smoky, woody, earthy notes.  Some people say they smell flint or just rock.  I don&#x27;t get that so much.  Also, there are citrus notes in there but they quickly retreat to the background.  This sent is dominated by the smoky notes.  It&#x27;s really almost like a campfire.  Word of caution, I would only do a couple of sprays with this one.  It has staying power and pretty decent projection so you really don&#x27;t want to overdo it.  If you do you&#x27;ll be &amp;#34;that guy&amp;#34;, the one that you can smell across the office wearing too much cologne.  I would also say this scent is very refined and sophisticated.  It is probably best suited for gentlemen in their late 20&#x27;s and up.  Men generally seem to like this fragrance.  Women either LOVE this one or some may think it smells weird.  I have gotten both reactions from the ladies.  More positives than negatives though.  It&#x27;s a safe work cologne as long as you don&#x27;t overdo it.  It s definitely a good cologne for special occasions.  As far as a date cologne?  If you have been with the women for a while I would say go for it.  If it is a new girlfriend I would go with something safe like Bleu de Chanel or Yves Saint Laurent l&#x27;homme or la nuit de l&#x27;homme or even Dolce &amp; Gabbana The One....there are others, those are just my recommendations.  In my opinion, Terre d&#x27;Hermes is something unique, powerful, classy, and very pleasant.  I would really recommend you try a sample at the mall first before buying it, but I love this one and think it is a great value here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Packaged and delivered on time. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this at &amp;#34;GayDays Orlando&amp;#34; and really liked how it smelled.  Decided to order some and was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like my Terre D&#x27;Hermes! It is a great summer scent.  Nice and light! I would recommend this scent to friends and family.....If I was not so secretive about what I am wearing.  I can&#x27;t have EVERYONE smelling as great as me! :-)</li>
    <li> I can confirm this is 100% authentic. Smells very masculine, but not overwhelmingly so. I don&#x27;t know many people who wear this scent, which to me adds to the appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is high quality and feels expensive in hand.  The sprayer is consistent and powerful.  I find two sprays is enough to last the entire work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I only ordered the 3.4 fl oz but was sent a gift box containing the 3.4 fl oz AND a smaller travel bottle (not sure if this was a mistake or not but it was much appreciated!)</li>
    <li> this was like trash i smells just 1 one than nothing , customer saying ther could get return just unopened box this is redicuolus , how can people be sure that permanence of the fregrance without opening and trying it , i dont wanna anything at all this is just redicuolus...</li>
    <li> I first encountered this cologne in 2005 and (thank goodness!) asked the man sitting next to me at the restaurant what cologne he was wearing. I&#x27;ve never forgotten it and recently purchased it for my boyfriend. It&#x27;s still hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure to experience!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied, I use this only for occasion.</li>
    <li> Smells good! Fast delivery and excellent price!</li>
    <li> wow, this smells great.  i caution you do not wear unless you want attention.  it will make complete strangers stop you on the street and ask you what cologne you have on.  i have had women just want to smell me and comment on how good i smell.&lt;br /&gt;it does smell awesome.  will certainly get more when this is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i could i would give this stuff ten stars.....</li>
    <li> Great smell I&#x27;ve always liked this cologne</li>
    <li> Love this cologne on my husband.</li>
    <li> I loved it, but then I got over the smell after a week and forgot I had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, but using it everyday made me nauseous. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long AT ALL so I was worried about it being counterfeit, but since it shipped directly from Amazon and researched counterfeit vs. legit bottles, I came to the conclusion that this bottle is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this scent on me, so there ya go.&lt;br /&gt;Best price on the web for this product that I could find at the time.  If you go to SAKS the price is much higher.</li>
    <li> It was for my cousin. He enjoyed it so much and I am glad I picked it that one. He used for his dinner rehearsal.</li>
    <li> this is my favourite cologne.  i&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> This fragrance has tones of citrus, and a woodsy drydown.  It&#x27;s fairly light, but remains pleasing and masculine for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have tons of perfumes. I never leave home without putting some on. I also have some men&#x27;s cologne, when the scent is woodsy, and musky. That&#x27;s why I adore Terre! Every time I&#x27;m wearing it, I get compliments. Every time!&lt;br /&gt;I always buy the biggest bottle, because I have to have Terre in my collection.</li>
    <li> What can I say that hasn&#x27;t been said? TdH is highly regarded on most fragrance forums. I sampled it at Sephora but it was always a little out of my comfort zone as far as price goes. I prefer more unisex-ish types of scents that are kind of on the sweet side. It took a while for TdH to grow on me, it has a dirty/gritty orange and woodsy smell to it. It&#x27;s a killer winter scent and should work well in the summer too. The 3.3oz bottle was about $40 cheaper on Amazon than at any of the major dept. stores!</li>
    <li> This eau de toilette smells so good. It is masculine, subdued, classy and never overwhelming. Great for day or night.</li>
    <li> Hermes fragrances are always tops, I&#x27;m hooked on 4.  This has a nice masculine fragrance, not sweet or overpowering. so</li>
    <li> An all time favorite.  Many times some one will tell me how good my cologne smells.  This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Imagine falling asleep inside of an orange blossom. That&#x27;s the feeling I get when I spray this juice on me.</li>
    <li> Received the bottle last week and tried everyday since.  it doesn&#x27;t last more than 15 minutes and smell different from when i tried a sample at Nordstrom a few weeks ago.  I don&#x27;t think this is a genuine product.  i tried to see if I can return the product but through Amazon, it says I can&#x27;t return due to health issue.  I have no option to return and stuck with the product.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY FROM YOUR LOCAL AUTHORIZED RETAILER.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent that will stick with you throughout the day!</li>
    <li> Smelled wonderful and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Smell&#x27;s OK but doesn&#x27;t last/project longer than 2 hours. Tried Terre D&#x27;Hermes parfum and that last longer. Look for the words parfum if you want any fragrance to stay long around you. This was a knock off. Must be the vendor or just the way the cologne is made. Too bad the scent diminishes.</li>
