    <li> Expensive but less so  when I order off amazon vs obagi website</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with the product, i was sold an expired Obagi Exfoderm Forte. My face had rashes the first time i used it. I stopped for a few days thinking it just might be new to my face. Tried it again &amp; the same, itching &amp; redness to face. Now it&#x27;s sitting in the medicine cabinet. Haven&#x27;t had a chance to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;According to Obagi website there is always expiration dates on their product for it to be legit. There is a date but an expired one. And still being sold here online.</li>
