### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>At a very good price.</li>
      <li>Joy is the best of all</li>
      <li>So, when I do wear Joy, I wear it sparingly, the pulse points.</li>
      <li>Great item</li>
      <li>She has liked Joy for over sixty years, she is almost 83 now!</li>
      <li>Joy has been a perfume that I have used off and on over the years.</li>
      <li>A very nice scent.</li>
      <li>My Wife liked it for Christmas!  </li>
      <li>Bought as a gift, my mother loved it.</li>
      <li>Also, it has a hint of roses in it which is good for menopause.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>Its nice -- if I wanted &amp;#34;Chanel #5&amp;#34;  -- but it is not &amp;#34;Joy.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s JOY and the basic fragrance is delicious.</li>
      <li>First time trying Joy - I purchased it because Josephine Baker and Billie Holiday wore this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It is a very classy scent which it&#x27;s light and perfect for summer.  </li>
      <li>Always wanted to try this perfume.so glad I did</li>
      <li>Love this, husband used to buy for me and since he is gone I get a memory with spritz.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>Love this scent, have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>It used to be the very rich women&#x27;s perfume, but now, almost everyone can wear it.</li>
      <li>Given its many ingredients, Joy does not smell like a specific flower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Joy is a light flowery scent, that most people enjoy.</li>
      <li>It does smell wonderful, but it is a little overpowering for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Joy is composed primarily of a combination of jasmine and rose; 10,000 jasmine flowers and 28 dozen roses are required to create 30ml of the parfum, contributing to its high retail price.</li>
      <li>and she was pleased it got here so fast.</li>
      <li>When I was first married I could not afford the perfume, and my husband bought it for very special occasions.</li>
      <li>Right away I detected rose and jasemine (few of my favorite scents)  </li>
      <li>I used it right away upon opening the package.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I was told it&#x27;s one of the light classic scent to wear.  </li>
      <li>I was introduced to Joy by a roommate, and she gave me the first small bottle I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have been overwhelmed by so many women&#x27;s perfumes, that I could feel short of breath.</li>
      <li>Joy also contains other flowers such as ylang ylang, michelia and tuberose.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>It is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>According to Luca Turin, &amp;#34;the whole point of its formula was to achieve the platonic idea of a flower, not one particular earthly manifestation.</li>
      <li>Now, I only wear it for special occasions.</li>
      <li>It is reminiscent of &amp;#34;Chanel # 5&amp;#34; -- sweet and floral.  </li>
      <li>The bottle was smaller than I realized because I usually spend the same amount for more, however its my moms favorite fragrance</li>
      <li>old any fragance gave a migraine headache.</li>

    <li> The bottle was smaller than I realized because I usually spend the same amount for more, however its my moms favorite fragrance and she was pleased it got here so fast. Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, my mother loved it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.  At a very good price.</li>
    <li> Hubby knows this is always a hit as a birthday present for me, so I ordered it for myself this year..</li>
    <li> It does smell wonderful, but it is a little overpowering for me.  I&#x27;ll just dab les.</li>
    <li> Joy has been a perfume that I have used off and on over the years. I was introduced to Joy by a roommate, and she gave me the first small bottle I have ever had. When I was first married I could not afford the perfume, and my husband bought it for very special occasions. Now, I only wear it for special occasions. I have become an anti perfume person. I have been overwhelmed by so many women&#x27;s perfumes, that I could feel short of breath. So, when I do wear Joy, I wear it sparingly, the pulse points. I do not spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Joy is composed primarily of a combination of jasmine and rose; 10,000 jasmine flowers and 28 dozen roses are required to create 30ml of the parfum, contributing to its high retail price.Joy also contains other flowers such as ylang ylang, michelia and tuberose. Given its many ingredients, Joy does not smell like a specific flower. According to Luca Turin, &amp;#34;the whole point of its formula was to achieve the platonic idea of a flower, not one particular earthly manifestation. The bottle was created by French architect and artisan Louis S&amp;uuml;e and was designed to have a simple, classical feel.&amp;#34; Wiki&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joy is a light flowery scent, that most people enjoy. It used to be the very rich women&#x27;s perfume, but now, almost everyone can wear it. Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-19-15</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;Joy&amp;#34; by Jean Patou.  I realize that it is no longer manufactured in America. The package reads &amp;#34;Made in France&amp;#34;; above it reads SA Designer Parfums, Ltd., England.  All I know is -- the fragrance does not smell like &amp;#34;Joy.&amp;#34;  It is reminiscent of &amp;#34;Chanel # 5&amp;#34; -- sweet and floral.  &amp;#34;Joy&amp;#34; has a deeper undertone of jasmine. Nowhere in the ingredients list is there the word &amp;#34;jasmine.&amp;#34;  Unless it is given some other name that I don&#x27;t recognize.  ?  Its nice -- if I wanted &amp;#34;Chanel #5&amp;#34;  -- but it is not &amp;#34;Joy.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I can buy at our local Macy&#x27;s but I do like to get out  this is product I use anyway</li>
    <li> A very nice scent. I really like it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> First time trying Joy - I purchased it because Josephine Baker and Billie Holiday wore this fragrance.  It&#x27;s been around for years and I wanted to try it.  Also, it has a hint of roses in it which is good for menopause. Overall I like the fragrance and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was told it&#x27;s one of the light classic scent to wear.  I used it right away upon opening the package.  I absolutely love it!  Right away I detected rose and jasemine (few of my favorite scents)  I now wear them all the time!  It is a very classy scent which it&#x27;s light and perfect for summer.  I just can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; whwn I was 17 yrss. old any fragance gave a migraine headache. but ladtely I&#x27;ts hard to find...I quas the happiest person on earth......</li>
    <li> Sent on time. Great item</li>
    <li> My Wife liked it for Christmas!  She has liked Joy for over sixty years, she is almost 83 now!</li>
    <li> It is not the real thing. It&#x27;s a poor &amp;#34; facsimile&amp;#34;. I feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> Love this, husband used to buy for me and since he is gone I get a memory with spritz.</li>
    <li> Love this scent, have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Always wanted to try this perfume.so glad I did</li>
    <li> Joy is the best of all</li>
    <li> Certainly not as strong as I remember.  Perhaps because it&#x27;s made in UK not France????&lt;br /&gt;Still...... it&#x27;s JOY and the basic fragrance is delicious.</li>
