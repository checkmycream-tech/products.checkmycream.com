      <li>both - be sure to check my reviews for more info).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I mostly use this on my 4 and 2 year olds hair for smoothing out tangles.</li>
      <li>This is OK, but I am not fond of the fragrance</li>
      <li>However, Johnson&#x27;s &amp;#34;no more tangles&amp;#34; detangler works wonders on me.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>It smells great and works very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to spray and unlike the Johnson leave In cream, which I find works better, it doesn&#x27;t get all over your hands</li>

      <li>Love that this is light</li>
      <li>There is no nasty smell like in some hair products, and it&#x27;s quite cheap as well.</li>

      <li>My hair tangles very easily and very dificult to detangle without breaking my hair.</li>
      <li>Works great on my daughter&#x27;s long hair after swimming.</li>
      <li>wait a couple of seconds and combed right thru.. amazing stuff really.</li>
      <li>Between this spray and using a new detangling brush , drying her hair has gone from a nightly battle to an easy and enjoyable quick process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
      <li>But I love the stuff so much</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s quick for when I&#x27;m running out the door.</li>
      <li>What can I say, she was born with a few inches already LOL.</li>
      <li>Use everyday, works great.</li>
      <li>While the spray is still freshly applied no amount of Florida heat and humidity can turn me from Dr Jekyll into mister Afro-Head.</li>
      <li>and this is the last product I will use on her until she&#x27;s a teenager making her own choices.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and clean, not greasy, makes combing wet hair a breeze.</li>
      <li>I high light my hair</li>
      <li>I can brush through it right after spraying it with no whines or cries AND it leaves her hair so pretty and shiny after it dries.</li>
      <li>I skipped actual conditioner to try this, and it worked really well at detangling on its own.</li>
      <li>I have dry, bleached hair and this lightweight spray goes on and quickly makes my hair softer and able to be combed.</li>
      <li>Great Product, it does rectangle your hair, just wish manufactures would think of the older population, after a few sprays, my fingers and hand was fatigued.  </li>
      <li>I knew I had to go out of my way to make sure I left a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it on my 4 year olds curly hair that consistently knots up</li>
      <li>With the coupon for first time buyers it&#x27;s cheaper than the stores.</li>
      <li>We own and use a Wet Brush however that alone does not keep her from whining or complaining.</li>
      <li>We brush and braid her hair every night before bed to prevent as many tangles as possible.</li>
      <li>I love this detangling mist, it works wonders on my long straight hair.  </li>
      <li>After spraying this product to almost her entire head, the comb glides through easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this works with other hair types, but its perfect for curly hair.</li>
      <li>Have long, fine hair &amp; must use a detangler, was hoping this wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;over-moisturize&amp;#34; but it works very well &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel like added product on hair - would recommend!</li>
      <li>It works like a charm and actually leaves me hair feeling smooth, though if you use too much it will feel a tad sticky.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works as advertised. I have dry, bleached hair and this lightweight spray goes on and quickly makes my hair softer and able to be combed.</li>
    <li> I high light my hair so this leaves me with tangles, I use conditioner but that is not enough for this problem.  This product is great just spray in on, comb it and your done.</li>
    <li> Untangles my curly hair after a washing  so I can get a comb through it before styling.  The scent is not overpowering like some other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this detangler!  It smells great and works very well. I would highly recommend to anyone who has long, thick, and/or dry hair.  It makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> Able to comb through hair smoothly. Doesn&#x27;t leave sticky residue feel. My hair frequently knots up and this help comb it out.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> It does not work at all for my hair to help with tangles. It&#x27;s just perfume-y water, at best.  However, Johnson&#x27;s &amp;#34;no more tangles&amp;#34; detangler works wonders on me. Background: semi-curly, long red hair.</li>
    <li> After swimming regularly, my daughter&#x27;s hair was quite dry and daily had tangles. This product helped, yet made her hair gummy and sticky if we used it more than a couple days in a row without washing. Okay for temporary use and something cheap.  The fragrance is strong, however, but pleasant. Don&#x27;t purchase if you have a sensitivity to fragrances.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It does the job and it smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and clean, not greasy, makes combing wet hair a breeze.</li>
    <li> Have long, fine hair &amp; must use a detangler, was hoping this wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;over-moisturize&amp;#34; but it works very well &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel like added product on hair - would recommend!</li>
    <li> This is OK, but I am not fond of the fragrance so I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. I had fallen asleep with my wet hair twisted into a knot inside a hair clip, so when I woke up I had a snarled disaster on top of my head! This detangler was wonderful and was so easy to use. I would have pulled out a chunk of hair if not for this stuff. There is no nasty smell like in some hair products, and it&#x27;s quite cheap as well. I recommend it to others with very long, semi-fine hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. It smells much better to me than the kids stuff, which I&#x27;ve been using for years. Funny enough, I can&#x27;t find an adult detangling spray in any store I go to. So, it&#x27;s nice that Amazon has this.</li>
    <li> Does help with waist length hair</li>
    <li> Does the job. Makes my hair softer and detangles my bleached hair.</li>
    <li> Great Product, it does rectangle your hair, just wish manufactures would think of the older population, after a few sprays, my fingers and hand was fatigued.  But tolerable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the same product but it&#x27;s the closest thing I can find. So I&#x27;ve included a picture of what I&#x27;m reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m embarrassed to say that I don&#x27;t leave reviews on Amazon very often because I use them to buy almost everything. But I love the stuff so much I knew I had to go out of my way to make sure I left a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is five years old with hair down to her bum. What can I say, she was born with a few inches already LOL. We own and use a Wet Brush however that alone does not keep her from whining or complaining. We brush and braid her hair every night before bed to prevent as many tangles as possible. I also put Biosilk on her hair after every bath and use conditioner as well. But alas nothing seems to make a fraction of a difference until now!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I bought about half a dozen different products at target ranging from high to low in price to try on her. This one was not only the winner but it was the cheapest one and it far exceeded my needs. It makes her hair smells soooo good! I can brush through it right after spraying it with no whines or cries AND it leaves her hair so pretty and shiny after it dries. I&#x27;m talking way shinier than it is naturally. I&#x27;m getting rid of everything else I use on her and this is the last product I will use on her until she&#x27;s a teenager making her own choices. Lol. Believe me I&#x27;m going back for their shampoo as well!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows maybe I&#x27;ll ditch my salon products and switch for my own hair too! And yes, I tried my expensive salon products on her as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS we don&#x27;t bother braiding before bed anymore. No need to! Yay!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one happy Mama to all in search of the right product for their girls... Buy it! I promise you won&#x27;t regret it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost forgot for those times when you need to skip a wash because your short on time....this stuff will bring their hair right back to life and look like it was just washed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;lltry to follow up with a picture of her hair before after use.</li>
    <li> With thick, long hair, I needed something to get the tangles out. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and I found this works best.</li>
    <li> Product arrived swiftly. Item as described.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping it would help detangle my fine, thin long hair, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. The comb didn&#x27;t go through my wet (conditioned) hair any easier after using this product.</li>
    <li> it does help get the tangles out works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had such a hard time finding this in drug stores. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon. I love this detangling mist, it works wonders on my long straight hair.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I spray this on my daughter&#x27;s (long, thick) hair before drying every night. Between this spray and using a new detangling brush , drying her hair has gone from a nightly battle to an easy and enjoyable quick process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your sanity and protect their hair at the same time - WIN WIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend, and also highly recommend the purchase of a detangling brush (I&#x27;ve reviewed two and highly recommend both - be sure to check my reviews for more info).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Amazon frequently offers this as an Add-On Item and has a GREAT coupon that can be applied to it.  We stock up every time the coupon is offered, so we never run out of this spray!</li>
    <li> this is a great detangler.  I use it on my 4 year olds curly hair that consistently knots up and it makes it easy to brush out her hair</li>
    <li> Makes my granddaughter&#x27;s hair is smooth and manageable when we use this. The fragrance is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I find this works okay. Not bad not great. I mostly use this on my 4 and 2 year olds hair for smoothing out tangles. It&#x27;s easy to spray and unlike the Johnson leave In cream, which I find works better, it doesn&#x27;t get all over your hands and it&#x27;s quick for when I&#x27;m running out the door.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why pantene confuses customers by having different bottles and packaging for the same product -- sometimes this product comes in a brown bottle, and other times in a red bottle -- the manufacturer should get it right and make it consistent branding for customers!</li>
    <li> Best detangler for the price.</li>
    <li> Works great to detangle hair and smell nice.</li>
    <li> THE BEST ON THE MARKET!! We were using kids detangle and with my kids curly thick hair I was spraying 30 spray every time i brushed her hair! This product is amazing and really does work now I only do about 3 sprays for her hair and no tears ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over 60 and have lots of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine.  Blow drying my hair was a nightmare because I&#x27;d have knots that I couldn&#x27;t get out.  I even tried the johnsons children&#x27;s detangler to no avail. I LOVE this!  It made my life so much easier.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, easily knotted and many detanglers give me a greasy look. Not this one. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Though not as good as my staple leave-in spray, I bought this detangler on a whim to leave at my boyfriend&#x27;s house. It works like a charm and actually leaves me hair feeling smooth, though if you use too much it will feel a tad sticky.</li>
    <li> Works &amp; smells great!</li>
    <li> This product is not a very good detangler! It&#x27;s very difficult to get the comb through no matter how much I use.</li>
    <li> I bought this assuming it would help unclog my shower. I live with 3 women so I knew there must be a huge tangled clog down there. It did not work as expected even though I used the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> Use everyday, works great. Can&#x27;t get in local stores.</li>
    <li> a good product not available locally</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the brush slid through any easier when using this product, even in great amounts. It also tends to make my hair hard after it dries which I dislike, and also appears greasy when it is not. I don&#x27;t know how so many people left a great review of it.</li>
    <li> works ok, not too impressed by the product</li>
    <li> This works great on my thin, fine hair...doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like other conditioners and keeps the hair loss from combing to a minimum.</li>
    <li> Works great! I use this with damp hair before I brush. Very helpful</li>
    <li> LOVE this! it detangles and smells great. Sometimes I just use it as a touch up spray so I don&#x27;t have to shampoo my hair everyday.</li>
    <li> The woman I bought it for says it does a good job.  I bet it will do a good job for you, if it doesn&#x27;t, let me know and I will kick my friend&#x27;s ass!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works very well, even with stubborn tangles. Helped me get a really big knot out of my super long, thick hair once. It also smells nice and makes my hair feel good when it dries (instead of sticky like some do).</li>
    <li> This is great on my daughters long, thick hair. It leaves her hair so soft!</li>
    <li> Best detangler I&#x27;ve used so far. I have naturally curly hair that tends to weigh down at the ends. Even with layers its hard to get volume at the top of my hair. I really didn&#x27;t expect this product to help with that, but after my first time using it, my hair is extremely soft and has a lot volume. It also didn&#x27;t take away any of my natural curl. I skipped actual conditioner to try this, and it worked really well at detangling on its own. I&#x27;m not sure how this works with other hair types, but its perfect for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This might be one of the worst hair products I&#x27;ve ever used. It does the exact opposite of the claims on the bottle, made my hair extremely dry and brittle and took twice as long as it usually does to comb through my hair. Definitely would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really help my hair and since buying it I&#x27;ve converted to the curly girl method and the ingredients for this doesn&#x27;t allow it to be apart of my hair care anymore</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money. This product doesn&#x27;t work whatsoever. I HATE it. Joico Detangler Spray has worked great for me, but thought I be cost effective. However, that was a horrible idea.</li>
    <li> this stuff is like magic ! my daughter had a mean knot and a couple of smaller knots in back of hair in morning. a few spurts... wait a couple of seconds and combed right thru.. amazing stuff really. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have used  so many other danglers and with two girls who have very long hair (waist length).  Finally!!!  I don&#x27;t have to stress so much about lathering their hair in good conditioner, as a few sprays of this does the job.  It isn&#x27;t heavy on the hair and smells great!  Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> This made my hair quite dry upon use, and did not have any &amp;#34;silkening&amp;#34; effect as it claims.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, will order again</li>
    <li> I love this product it works and has a great smell</li>
    <li> This is a great detangler. One of the best out there. Works great on my daughter&#x27;s long hair after swimming.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter. Loved the clip free coupon offered by amazon, made the price unbeatable. She uses it as a detangling spray and puts it in her hair before she brushes. She is 8 and all the other kid sprays have pretty strong, fruity smells that actually made her hair smell strange, but not this one. The smell is great and it helps get the knots out.</li>
    <li> I spray this a few times a day. It&#x27;s great for battling winter dryness.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my 6 yr old daughter, who has an extremely sensitive scalp and cannot tolerate anyone brushing her hair.  After spraying this product to almost her entire head, the comb glides through easily.  I use it on her wet and dry hair.  (I chose this over the $20 brand which was recommended by my stylist) I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a great spray on conditioner to detangle and keep hair conditioned.  Just spray on hair and comb.</li>
    <li> Detangles and moisturizes as it says, but also leaves you hair stronger and incredibly soft!</li>
    <li> I use this when I forget to use conditioner in the shower. Can&#x27;t comb? Fixed!</li>
    <li> WORKS GETS KNOTS OUT ALL THE GREAT STUFF GIVE A 100</li>
    <li> My hair tangles very easily and very dificult to detangle without breaking my hair. This has been a miracle product for me. After 60 years of my life finally found a product that I just spray a little bit and the detangling comb glides through my hair. It also leaves my hair soft and with body, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a large white guy with extremely curly hair. At about 1/2&amp;#34; it starts waving at you. Now that I&#x27;ve let it grow out I&#x27;ve noticed small furry mammals nesting in it. This product solves my dilemma without resorting to scissors. The fragrance is similar to expensive salon leave-in conditioners. While the spray is still freshly applied no amount of Florida heat and humidity can turn me from Dr Jekyll into mister Afro-Head. A day later I puffed up a little in the 90+ heat and humidity. However, as soon as I made it indoors it returned to the same degree of softness. Definitely recommend. With the coupon for first time buyers it&#x27;s cheaper than the stores.</li>
    <li> Love that this is light so I can use a lot or a little. Stashed it in my swim bag and use it after the pool. I have thin extremely long hair and husband has short extra thick hair works in both.</li>
    <li> 2 bottles arrived unsealed.</li>
    <li> I got this to try a cheaper option vs. Milkshake leave in conditioner which I regularly use.  It does the trick but doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as awesome.  May buy it again just to save $s.</li>
