### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, there are tricks to get the best results</li>
      <li>I never get it perfect-</li>
      <li>but this product was awesome</li>
      <li>Always keep trying till you get the best result for you.</li>
      <li>So practice makes perfect.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great!</li>
      <li>People who give TMI always give the best reviews, so I&#x27;m going to overshare on this one.  </li>
      <li>Very good to take with for vacations</li>
      <li>The perfect warm temp!</li>
      <li>This product worked great on my bikini line and on my knees.</li>
      <li>I did not know this in advance, so I DO NOT suggest this for that use, but it is great for bikini line.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>This kit is great for removing arm hair.</li>
      <li>Practice makes perfect, so perhaps I could make this product work if I bought another couple of boxes, but there are better alternatives.</li>
      <li>Hope everyone else has good of luck as I have.</li>
      <li>If you do as the directions state and rub the strips to warm them, it won&#x27;t work that great.</li>
      <li>It seemed to good to be</li>
      <li>It does a good job.</li>
      <li>but this is true of waxing at the best salons.</li>
      <li>The packet inside the box was still sealed with the perforated strip at the top, so it couldn&#x27;t have been tampered with before I received it.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the strips didn&#x27;t even work!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for 5+ years and love them!</li>
      <li>Rubbing the strips to warm them sounds okay in theory, but if you get ANY wax on your hands, how are you supposed to rub the strip without separating them, since your skin sticks to the plastic!</li>
      <li>This product is great, follow the instructions and you should be fine.</li>
      <li>Thanks SH for a great product, I will buy again!</li>
      <li>I started out doing it by the directions and rubbing a wax strip between my hands to warm it up</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t force myself to apply the epilator to my skin in order to even see if it would be effective.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s the safest, most effective option.  </li>
      <li>I also made sure I warmed it between my hands before hand.</li>
      <li>I have waxed many times before and know how it is done, but I had never used the strips before.</li>
      <li>I love Sally Hansen products which is mostly why i purchased this item.</li>
      <li>Even if it looks safe, you won&#x27;t know till after you shave to see if ou get irritation or not.</li>
      <li>I tried re-applying once more and nothing.</li>
      <li>Plus, it HURTS!!! :)</li>
      <li>Veet is way better</li>
      <li>They work okay.</li>
      <li>Typically I love Sally Hansen for quality beauty products but these wax strips were the worst.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>: I light a candle and hold the strips over the candle to warm them a bit more.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t order from amazon again because I&#x27;d rather buy an untampered box from the store for more money.</li>
      <li>but ou get so many more sheets with the box for the body.</li>
      <li>A place that most people won&#x27;t see.</li>

      <li>it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing a large percentage of the hair.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not that much wax on the strip, so you have to kind of overlap areas you&#x27;ve already done to be sure you cover it all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a strong wax strip</li>
      <li>It did not, however, work on the fine hair on my thighs or toes.</li>
      <li>and that worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Had no problem either way with peeling them apart and using them, wax strip came off just fine and all the hair removed.</li>
      <li>That worked fine too.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t hurt at all (pull quickly!)</li>

      <li>There are only two &amp;#34;extra large&amp;#34; wax strips which cover a great area.</li>

      <li>I really liked these strips because it was not messy at all.  </li>
      <li>All of the wax comes off with all the hair in one swift, quick move.</li>
      <li>It also hurt a lot more then normal waxing.</li>

      <li>These are so easy to use, they work really well</li>
      <li>I was really excited about these wax strips at first.</li>
      <li>Worked pretty well, I read other reviews and found that if I use the hairdryer it works a bit better than my hands to warm up the wax.  </li>
      <li>Biggest issue: you can&#x27;t get them warm enough with just your hands or body.</li>
      <li>To get it warm enough you have to rub forever.</li>
      <li>I have more sensitive skin than her</li>
      <li>The past year or two I just plug in my hot rollers and lay a stack of however many wax strips I&#x27;m going to use on top!</li>
      <li>To wax a full leg you would probably have to use the whole box.</li>
      <li>You can warm them with a hair dryer to get them warm enough, but they still don&#x27;t work as well as the other brands.</li>
      <li>2nd it hurts like Hell fire which would be worth it if it actually worked but 3rd, at most no matter how many times I tried, it rips out at most 20% of the hairs and leaves the rest to laugh at you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a rash or anything from them, and I very much prefer to do it at home rather than having some stranger waxing my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First of all, hot waxes or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I tried it on my face and it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!</li>
      <li>Then you apply, hold your skin taut, and pull it off as fast as you can!  </li>
      <li>The strips where a challenge to cut in the right size for certain areas(under arms and eye brows.)</li>
      <li>You never get it on the first try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>family member, or research online to find out more information on proper length of hair that can be waxed.</li>
      <li>Possibly the smaller strips are good for bikini line, but I didn&#x27;t have much success with that either.</li>
      <li>will but more next time!</li>
      <li>And it irritates your skin on top of that, whether its from re-applying and re-applying or from the actual waxing ingredient I don&#x27;t know.</li>
      <li>Haha!</li>
      <li>Per the package, there are supposed to be 24 extra large strips (the ones I find most useful) and 6 large strips.</li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 2 and not 1 stars is it dose work pretty good on facial hair.</li>
      <li>First of all, my package said I would receive 24 X-Large strips and 6 Large strips.</li>
      <li>But this is the 2nd time I tried this particular brand, apparently it got good reviews.</li>
      <li>Kind of hard to warm up enough though</li>
      <li>So make sure you keep track of how long your hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>This product does not work; it&#x27;s pretty much a waset of my money.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stand having prickly legs and all you get with shaving is prickly legs and that itchy feeling pretty much immediately.  </li>
      <li>they were easy to use and didn&#x27;t make a huge mess.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s mess free and so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>this thinking I was saving money on large waxing kits and it would work just as well.</li>
      <li>you rub it til it gets a little warm.</li>
      <li>The whole reason I bought</li>
      <li>This product is an absolute rip off.</li>
      <li>All it did was make me sticky, and didn&#x27;t take off any or much hairs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It says on the box that there are supposed to be 15 strips. I got only 9 in my box. The packaging was terrible. The box was completely smashed and the finishing oil bottle was lying somewhere else in the package. I would say that you buy this at a drugstore.</li>
    <li> I was going on vacation to the beach and thought I would wax so I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave while I was there. I have waxed many times before and know how it is done, but I had never used the strips before. I never will again! Rubbing the strips to warm them sounds okay in theory, but if you get ANY wax on your hands, how are you supposed to rub the strip without separating them, since your skin sticks to the plastic! To get it warm enough you have to rub forever. I bought three boxes so I would have some for later. Whatever! I had to use two boxes just to get the lower half of both legs. And it took forever because you only get a few of the larger size (???) so I had to finish with the smaller ones. There&#x27;s not that much wax on the strip, so you have to kind of overlap areas you&#x27;ve already done to be sure you cover it all. After all that, it didn&#x27;t even work! Some of the hair (about 1/4) wasn&#x27;t even pulled at all. Some of it actually broke at the skin rather than removing the follicle. Don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s about. There was so much hair left I would have to practically wax the whole thing again just to get it all, assuming it would work the second time through. I didn&#x27;t want to go through the pain again so I just shaved the next day anyway. The whole reason I bought it was so I DIDN&#x27;T HAVE TO SHAVE. Did they not try this product before they started selling it?</li>
    <li> Perhaps my hair is too thick, but this barely pulled off anything.  Too much torture for too little hair removal.</li>
    <li> The box comes with 4 large strips, 6 smaller strips and oil. I found the strips to be useless because they only grabbed a few hairs at a time. The strips are also made of plastic which turned me off because its not easy to manipulate as paper strips are. I tried it on my armpits and legs and that didn&#x27;t work so well but it would probably work for the small hairs on your fingers as it did for me.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about these wax strips at first. It seemed to good to be true-- they were easy to use and didn&#x27;t make a huge mess. They worked too-- they took the hair off, but a few days later my skin was absolutely COVERED in ACNE!! Usually people wax so they can bare their skin, but this made my skin so gross and embarrassing that I didn&#x27;t want anyone to see. Only took a few days to get the acne, but it has lasted much, much longer than that. I can&#x27;t believe this is happening to me and I don&#x27;t think I ever want to use this product again.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand since 2007 that has worked for me. Veet wax strips don&#x27;t pull the hair out and heating up wax burns my legs. Since I&#x27;ve been waxing for years with this product, my hair re-growth time is getting to about three months! Almost to four months from years of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there are tricks to get the best results: 1) make sure the hand you are using to pull the skin back is holding down very tight because the force of the other ripping the strip off can in fact make it tricky to get all the hair. So practice makes perfect. Always keep trying till you get the best result for you. You never get it on the first try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;2) Take some tylenol/advil 30 minutes before waxing if you don&#x27;t like pain. It&#x27;s been proven through research and studies that this helps alleviate pain, especially when waxing sensitive places on the body.&lt;br /&gt;3) Always make sure your legs are cleaned/washed down before waxing. The wax doesn&#x27;t hold well against skin that has oil and dirt.&lt;br /&gt;4) If you miss a few hair: just use some tweezers to pluck out the rest. I do it and then everything is a okay.&lt;br /&gt;5) Don&#x27;t shave near the waxed spot for 24 hours. Even if it looks safe, you won&#x27;t know till after you shave to see if ou get irritation or not. So don&#x27;t jinx it by shaving too soon after waxing.&lt;br /&gt;6) Make sure the hair isn&#x27;t too short or too long. If it&#x27;s over an inch, it&#x27;s time to wax, but if it&#x27;s two inches long, it&#x27;s TOO long to wax. If it&#x27;s under 1/4 of an inch, it&#x27;s too short. Not sure if you are the recommended lengt? Ask a friend. family member, or research online to find out more information on proper length of hair that can be waxed. I&#x27;ve personally waxed it once when it was too short and nothing came off on the strip. I&#x27;ve also waxed it too long and it got really patchy looking. So make sure you keep track of how long your hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s very possible to have an allergic reaction to ingredients in wax, so if you&#x27;ve never waxed before, test on your upper thigh FIRST! A place that most people won&#x27;t see. Wait 24-48hrs after that and see if you get red bumps, stringing, and what may look like acne but is really ingrown hair due to the follicle breaking off inside the pour of the removed hair (also oil got inside with oxygen creating a pimple like effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember, every instruction booklet of the products has a $1 off coupon for Sally Hanson wax strips! M favorite part of buying the product. Also to get the better deal, try your Walmart because it&#x27;s the only place that constantly stocks and carries the strips.e, test on your upper thigh FIRST!

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Doesn&#x27;t grab the hair. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I waxed a part of my leg using sally hansen strips about 3 years ago. I was badly bruised and it hurt for days. Even today the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back on that particular area of my leg. I&#x27;ll never use sally hansen ready to wax stips again.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up for Nair microwaveable peach melon extract wax though. It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I HATE shaving my knees (it&#x27;s awkward and I always cut myself) and thought maybe if I shave my legs and wax my knees it&#x27;ll be easier. This product is great, follow the instructions and you should be fine. I&#x27;m lucky to have non-sensitive skin (I&#x27;d be wary if I had either of the above) but this product was awesome and I think I&#x27;ll start waxing my legs (not just my knees) all through winter (not sure if I can handle summer yet). Didn&#x27;t hurt at all (pull quickly!) and no more redness/bumps than a salon wax. Don&#x27;t expect you&#x27;ll be back to your normal skin colour right away - there will be redness/bumps but this is true of waxing at the best salons. So go in with realistic expectations and you&#x27;ll save yourself $30 over a salon wax. Thanks SH for a great product, I will buy again!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! I used it on my legs, and it only gets about half the hair, you have to do it several times in the same spot, leaving your skin red, with bumps, and even then it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair! I used about half the box just to get the bottom part of my legs, which still has hair on them. No good, throwing the rest away.</li>
    <li> It was the worst wax kit ive ever had the misfortune of trying.  The wax never got hot enough despite minutes of hard rubbing. Once i slipped the wax strip on the afflicted area it would bunch up. After waxing only 3 or 4 hairs would come out at one time. There was simply not enough wax per stip(a very thin smear). The oil they put in the package to soothe your skin after waxing is very greasy. Please use Nair or perhaps veet instead.</li>
    <li> Compared to other brands (Nads, Veet) this comes in last. Biggest issue: you can&#x27;t get them warm enough with just your hands or body. When pulling apart the strips after following the instructions, the wax is still too solid and one side will take all the wax. The wax is also not sticky enough. You can warm them with a hair dryer to get them warm enough, but they still don&#x27;t work as well as the other brands.</li>
    <li> I used the wax on my legs and it took nothing off. It also left a rash. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!&lt;br /&gt;Bought this thinking I was saving money on large waxing kits and it would work just as well. There are only two &amp;#34;extra large&amp;#34; wax strips which cover a great area. But then, there are only a bunch of tiny ones. Not only that but when the hair is pulled from one section it does not remove all of it, it leaves many hairs behind. It hurts a whole lot, and at least for me it could only do my right calf. NEVER BUYING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN !</li>
    <li> This product worked great on my bikini line and on my knees. It did not, however, work on the fine hair on my thighs or toes.</li>
    <li> I like it! It&#x27;s a strong wax strip .I cut mine into 4 parts so that I won&#x27;t waste them,I used them on my underarm which really works well for me! And on the bikini part,it burns! But it took lots of hair as well that&#x27;s why I like it! Just follow instructions and it&#x27;ll work just fine,without spending too much on the other brand,will but more next time!</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use, they work really well if you know how to use them.</li>
    <li> The packaging is incorrect, hence the one star. Per the package, there are supposed to be 24 extra large strips (the ones I find most useful) and 6 large strips. Instead, there are 6 extra large strips and 24 large strips. I have bought several boxes of this in the past and it&#x27;s always the same.</li>
    <li> A waste of money!!!! I&#x27;m giving one star because I&#x27;m forced to. Comes with very small strips that barely work even on the very first time you apply them. Absolutely a rip off and not worthy the money. Veet is way better and I bought this one because they did not have Veet. What a waste!</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered like 6 boxes of this instead of the wax you heat up in a microwave. I tried this when I had already waxed my legs and I just had a few hairs growing sporadically. I had to practically use the whole box and i followed the instructions and it didnt do anything at all. Honestly it just wasted my time. The microwavable wax is the only thing that works for me, I just hate I wasted my time and money on this</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin do not purchase this product. Yes it does do the work but it leaves my upper lip red and with a very uncomfortable feeling. I have to rotate from using hydrocortisone, Vaseline and aquaphor for a few days and then my skin starts to peel. Very harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have attempted to use this multiple times.  Each time it removes SOME of the hair from the area being treated, but does not remove even half of the hair from the areas.  Plus, it HURTS!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed the instructions each time, and each time there are some hairs attached to the wax when completed ... it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing a large percentage of the hair.</li>
    <li> First of all, my package said I would receive 24 X-Large strips and 6 Large strips. Instead I found in my packet 24 Large strips and only 4 X&#x27;Large strips. The packet inside the box was still sealed with the perforated strip at the top, so it couldn&#x27;t have been tampered with before I received it.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the strips didn&#x27;t even work! After warming them in my hands and applying in the direction of hair growth, the strips only pulled out about half of the hairs on my legs. I felt like I needed to use multiple sheets to go over each patch of hair to get it all out. Typically I love Sally Hansen for quality beauty products but these wax strips were the worst.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, once I ran out of wax sheets I ended up just shaving the rest of my leg hair off.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my legs.  First, it didn&#x27;t even come with enough of the large strips to wax one whole leg. Second, it doesn&#x27;t work. It pulled only a few hairs out at a time. I wound up going over the same spot multiple times and it STILL didn&#x27;t get all of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because my epilator takes way too long, but after sitting in the bathroom for an hour with this junk, I think I&#x27;ll stick with the epilator.</li>
    <li> I swear by Sally Hansen. I prefer this to the container of wax as it is not messy. It does a good job. The container was is better at getting the hair out first rip but it can be messy.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving, but I don&#x27;t have a microwave, so this served its purpose. Very good to take with for vacations and it was much cheaper than the local stores around here.</li>
    <li> I use these strips to wax my under arms and bikini line. If you are looking to wax your legs, I wouldn&#x27;t use these strips. If you do as the directions state and rub the strips to warm them, it won&#x27;t work that great. But here is my tip: I light a candle and hold the strips over the candle to warm them a bit more. Just be careful not to melt the plastic. Works well for me!</li>
    <li> These were old. They lost their luster. I contacted seller and was refunded my money.</li>
    <li> Veet Wax strips are better and worth the price</li>
    <li> People who give TMI always give the best reviews, so I&#x27;m going to overshare on this one.  I have a long-standing obsession with leg waxing.  I can&#x27;t stand having prickly legs and all you get with shaving is prickly legs and that itchy feeling pretty much immediately.  So since college, I&#x27;ve tried every hair removal product you can think of- Nads, microwavable wax, an epilator, laser removal (which did nothing, btw).  This product is what I&#x27;ve settled on and have used for maybe 10 years.  I think it&#x27;s the safest, most effective option.  First of all, hot waxes or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; waxes that come with cloth strips tended to stick too well to my skin, so pulling the cloth left lots of wax and hair on my legs, and it was quite painful.  I have a low tolerance for pain and I couldn&#x27;t force myself to apply the epilator to my skin in order to even see if it would be effective.  This wax comes in plastic strips that you heat just by rubbing it with your hands.  Then you apply, hold your skin taut, and pull it off as fast as you can!  I used to have to count every time- if you don&#x27;t do a quick, sudden pull, you&#x27;ll end up with the problem of leaving wax and hair on your legs.  So one, two, three, RIP!  It only hurts for the split second, then it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented over the years with using this product right after a hot bath, using my hair dryer to heat it up, letting my leg hair get really long, etc. etc.  Long leg hair helps a lot.  There&#x27;s no improvement on using your hands to heat the wax- just make sure you rub a little for friction and take your time with this step.  The most important factor seems to be the quick pull, going against the direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have red bumps the day after, but the soothing oil that comes with this kit really helps.  It also gets any excess wax off your skin.  I never get it perfect- there&#x27;s always a little bit of shaving left to do.  But with 95% of the hair gone, shaving is quick and my legs are only 5% prickly, and it&#x27;s more than worth it to me.ly 5% prickly, and it&#x27;s more than worth it to me.</li>
    <li> This almost didn&#x27;t remove anything. I was gunna wax my legs but 1 strip only removes about 6 indivichal hairs. To wax a full leg you would probably have to use the whole box. It also hurt a lot more then normal waxing. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 2 and not 1 stars is it dose work pretty good on facial hair. Although I do have to wax the area twice to fully remove all unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> They work okay. Have to do it a couple times. DEFINITELY BE GENEROUS WITH AZULENE OIL. This was not recommended for vaginal use (on the lips). I did not know this in advance, so I DO NOT suggest this for that use, but it is great for bikini line.</li>
    <li> I love Sally Hansen products which is mostly why i purchased this item. I&#x27;m a little upset with the results. The strips where a challenge to cut in the right size for certain areas(under arms and eye brows.) It did come useful for bigger surface areas like arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Removed my hair so it will remove yours...I promise. I actually used them while riding in the back seat while my husband drove us to the beach. Its hard to make the time with a baby. It was not messy and worked really well.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s mess free and so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I usualy buy it at a drug store or target but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product since I was a teen. I only use it on my upper lip and eye brows.&lt;br /&gt;the box for face and body cost about the same but ou get so many more sheets with the box for the body. you can just cut it how you need it. you rub it til it gets a little warm. pull it part, rub it a couple times and pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;my sister breaks out if she uses this around her lips. I have more sensitive skin than her but I can use it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my bikini line and underarms and didn&#x27;t like how it works for that. but for thinner facial hair will be great</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, just doesn&#x27;t work well at all on underarms even when grown out, everywhere else is pretty much useless unless on the face</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a manilla envelope with no padding. The box was crushed and looked like it had already been opened. I was reluctant to use it because of it&#x27;s secondhand appearance but ended up trying it anyway. Removes hair for over a week, albeit a bit painfully. I won&#x27;t order from amazon again because I&#x27;d rather buy an untampered box from the store for more money.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well, I read other reviews and found that if I use the hairdryer it works a bit better than my hands to warm up the wax.  I really liked these strips because it was not messy at all.  I&#x27;ve tried other at home wax kits, and no matter how hard I try, I wind up spilling wax everywhere.  Like any waxing experience (at home or in a salon) waxing hurts, but these aren&#x27;t any more/less painful, and I really like the oil that came with and that&#x27;s help reduce the red spots afterwards.  I&#x27;ve never had a rash or anything from them, and I very much prefer to do it at home rather than having some stranger waxing my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they are pretty cheap, and worked well, but my only complaint is how many come in a box / how many I need.  It takes me about 3-4 boxes to wax both legs, bikini and my under arms (and I&#x27;m a pretty small person).  I can use each strip about 2-3 times, I think you&#x27;re only suppose to use each one once, but I find they still work pretty well the second time you use them), and I find that if I go over a spot about twice it will get all of the hair.  However there just aren&#x27;t enough wax strips in the box to do a whole leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with purchase 3-4 boxes every couple of months is still way cheaper than the salon and most other home waxing kits, I just think its a little ridiculous that the box states its for under arms and legs, and I can&#x27;t even finish one leg with one box.  I just wish there was some way to buy them in bulk and/or in a larger size so that I don&#x27;t have to keep purchasing multiple boxes to use at a time.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.it don&#x27;t remove hair at all . I used  the whole box and i followed the instructions and it didnt do anything at all. Honestly it just wasted my time. I hate this product</li>
    <li> The 4 large strips (8 double-sided) are not large enough to remove hair from half of one leg. The reminder of the strips are too small to cover both legs. Possibly the smaller strips are good for bikini line, but I didn&#x27;t have much success with that either. The hair removal was so patchy that I had to re-do areas, leading to redness.  Practice makes perfect, so perhaps I could make this product work if I bought another couple of boxes, but there are better alternatives. Hot wax is more expensive, but I find it quicker and the result is a whole lot better. The result from the cold wax strips was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> For the legs it is a waste of money unless you just want torture. 1st some of the strips are hard to find the separating point. 2nd it hurts like Hell fire which would be worth it if it actually worked but 3rd, at most no matter how many times I tried, it rips out at most 20% of the hairs and leaves the rest to laugh at you.</li>
    <li> This product does not work; it&#x27;s pretty much a waset of my money. All it did was make me sticky, and didn&#x27;t take off any or much hairs.</li>
    <li> This kit is great for removing arm hair. (not arm pit hair)  Quick and easy. Not quite painless but it barely hurts. Similar to a band aid removal.</li>
    <li> Ahhh! Where do I start? Well this thing sucks. Bad. I decided to use it on my face, legs, and arms. I let the hair grow out, which is thick on some areas and fine on others. I let it grow out for about 1-2 weeks. I tried it on my face and it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! I followed all the directions and exfoliated my face. I put it on in the direction of the hair growth and pulled it the opposite direction. I also made sure I warmed it between my hands before hand. Well, only two hairs came out. I tried re-applying once more and nothing. So I tried a different spot on my face, same results. I put the oil on, which did nothing because I woke up with a rash on my face the next day. I tried my arms 3 days later and not one hair came out. Its ridiculous. I got the same results on my legs. This product is an absolute rip off. It doesn&#x27;t get sticky enough and it doesn&#x27;t get any hair out. And it irritates your skin on top of that, whether its from re-applying and re-applying or from the actual waxing ingredient I don&#x27;t know. All I know is that this product doesn&#x27;t work and neither does that \\&quot;soothing oil\\&quot;. Maybe I got a faulty product? I don&#x27;t know. But this is the 2nd time I tried this particular brand, apparently it got good reviews. Not making the same mistake, you get what you pay for I guess. BTW, the picture advertised is different than the one on the actual box that you get. Just an FYI.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for 5+ years and love them! People who say they don&#x27;t work must be doing it wrong. I started out doing it by the directions and rubbing a wax strip between my hands to warm it up and that worked just fine. Felt like it took forever to me so I tried warming them with a blow dryer lol yes I was feeling lazy. That worked fine too. Had no problem either way with peeling them apart and using them, wax strip came off just fine and all the hair removed. The past year or two I just plug in my hot rollers and lay a stack of however many wax strips I&#x27;m going to use on top! Wala! The perfect warm temp! Haha! Anyways, I&#x27;ve had no issue with them what so ever. All of the wax comes off with all the hair in one swift, quick move. I always pull them off the opposite direction that the hair grows. I have never once had to use the wax remover oil that comes with them. Hope everyone else has good of luck as I have. Any questions please feel free to ask.</li>
    <li> did not work for me, just annoyed me</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re ok, smell real bad, but do pull some hair out. Kind of hard to warm up enough though</li>
    <li> So, this is the third self-waxing kit I&#x27;m trying and, while this one causes me minimal discomfort, it is removing very little hair from my legs. So, I&#x27;m going to through this sucker out.</li>
    <li> The item was delivered on time. However, when I start using it, wax strip can&#x27;t get any hair. Not happy about this purchase.</li>
    <li> The wax itself is fine, but the strip size is extremely small. There are only 3 normal size strips, rest are so so so small. Those would only work if you want to remove hair on fingers. I wound not buy it again.</li>
