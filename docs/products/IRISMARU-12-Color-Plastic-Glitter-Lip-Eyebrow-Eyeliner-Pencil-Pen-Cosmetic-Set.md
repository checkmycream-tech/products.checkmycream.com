<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Less of it in pencil than expected and bothers my eyes till i discontinued use.</li>
    <li> These are  great colors very bright and soft and great size</li>
    <li> Nice set for the money.</li>
    <li> i like it very much ..........shipping very fast ......</li>
    <li> Love these colors!  Smooth application!</li>
    <li> U can not re used just one time</li>
    <li> I just happily received my 12-pack of eyeliner in the mail this morning, and I go to put it on, and low and behold, it is unable to bring more of the color stick up.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a bad batch of eyeliner, but there is no way to twist the color stick up. If there is, please let me know. Otherwise, please be careful when deciding your makeup.&lt;br /&gt; AS WELL!,, the eyeliner does glide on smoothly and beautifully, though. The only issue is getting more color.</li>
    <li> i absoultly love these. they go on so smooth and such a bold color. they can b sharpened. i swatches them on the bak of my hand &amp; they were so pretty totaly buying again</li>
    <li> Came in when specified, work great.  Lots of fun to work with when doing a special makeup for date night!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter and she loves them! They glide on smoothly and stay on well. She also likes that they are easy to remove because they are not water-proof.</li>
    <li> It start to ich my eyes in a second and couldn&#x27;t use it at all :( Looks great of those color but not good for skin :(</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the colors</li>
    <li> I like the liners  ,but  it is worn down,you can&#x27;t sharpen it ,it&#x27;s pvc material ,and I tried turning the bottom and nothing . The liner runs the lentgh of stick so there has to be a way to renew when worn down ???</li>
    <li> Upset that you cannot sharpen these and there isn&#x27;t much of the color in each pencil, otherwise these would be perfect goes on so smoothly and colors are amazing</li>
    <li> Nice variety of colors but had a hard time figuring out how to sharpen them.  They look like they should twist up but in fact we had to sharpen them in a pencil sharpener.  Should add that to your instructions.</li>
    <li> Love it. Nice and bright colors.</li>
    <li> Very good quality with color staying power!!!</li>
    <li> They break easily, but very blend able.</li>
    <li> Great color pay off but they don&#x27;t sharpen or twist up. Once you use up the tip... It&#x27;s awkward to even try to get the last bit off without poking yourself in the eye</li>
    <li> Increased lipstick and eyeliner game by 2000000x</li>
    <li> Smooth beautiful colors.  Love it I feel like an Egyptian queen</li>
    <li> Good price for the assortment</li>
    <li> These r not glitter at all and u can&#x27;t twist the color out or sharpen..</li>
    <li> These are nice goes on very nice and smooth</li>
    <li> These are perfect and I love the variety of colors.</li>
    <li> OK..not as shimmery as I would of liked</li>
    <li> not really what I wanted</li>
    <li> They came on time and look exactly like they do in the picture. But like other reviews said, there is no way to sharpen or twist it up.  All of the colors don&#x27;t come out good &amp; some do. The ones that do look better as lip liner. Basically they are cheap, low quality. I&#x27;m going to give these to one of my little nieces for there kiddy makeup kit. Won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> they are very nice however after the point is worn down there&#x27;s no mechanism to get the rest of the product out of the stick...crazy</li>
    <li> Eh. Wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. Easy to use and sharpened with just a regular sharpener. Good buy compare to price.</li>
    <li> I love them for the price the pigmentation is great I would totally order them again they go on super smooth</li>
    <li> all the colors are super pretty and look great on my skin tone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, just can&#x27;t figure out what to do when it needs to be sharpened</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and cute colors</li>
    <li> Wish the color could stay on longer but its very pretty. Very outstanding. I give this product a thumbs up. (:</li>
    <li> I love these! Only about three are glittery and the color sticks to my lips so amazingly!</li>
    <li> the colors are AMAZING!! the things i can now do with my makeup is awesome, only question is how do i get the color stick up?</li>
    <li> This took over a month for me to get it....but they are nice</li>
    <li> Wonderful addition to my makeup collection! Beautiful colors that allow me to be creative in my eye designs.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected...</li>
    <li> It is creamy and very pigment.  Glide on smooth and stays on all day.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear, I recommend this to anyone who wants high quality at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> i bought these n then later realized that the seller said they could not be sharpened. i tried returning then before i even received them. however i was pleasantly surprised when i received them &amp; tested them out by sharpening the black one all the way down. seeing as i don&#x27;t use the black anyway. i have deiced not to return them as they are a great deal &amp; you can in fact sharpen them down after the original tip is worn down.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try different eye liner / lip liner. This was a very good product for what I was using it for. I love experimenting with make up so this was great for testing all the different colors, to see what i look with these different make-ups. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> love them you can sharpen the pencil looks plastic but it is actually wood</li>
    <li> I recommend this product definitely.</li>
    <li> Awesome color selection.  Glides on smooth and even.  Hope I can sharpen them.  Haven&#x27;t tried yet, otherwise they are all  basically one time use.  Also arrived much sooner than expected</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:1a2dd97b96ebac2b307cf83568cb72d4]] Check out the video to see the product up close and personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description. The video is more of an unboxing to show the product up close and share my opinions. I hope this look at the products has helped you make the decision to buy or not to buy. Thanks for taking the time to read my review! ***</li>
    <li> Colors are as vibrant and vivid as displayed in the picture. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Wish they didn&#x27;t have to be sharpened</li>
    <li> Awesome colors and you can shave them down using a pencil sharpener.</li>
    <li> I wanted glitter eye liner and they weren&#x27;t.i won&#x27;t buy them again. The price was great .oh we&#x27;ll maybe I give them away</li>
    <li> I love the colors and that you get so many for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didnt like is that you cant sharpen.&lt;br /&gt;Its only the small amount of the tip after that it is gone.&lt;br /&gt;Its just the tip that has color the rest of the pencil is empty.</li>
    <li> The colors are awesome. Lasts all day and shows well. Goes on very smooth.  Only downfall is they go very fast. Five or six uses and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I love it , but  they were so small , not like the pic</li>
    <li> I like these. There are plenty of colors and they work great. The price was great and was a good choice to add to my collection.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, been useing them, and also came sooner than expected. Will get more soon</li>
    <li> How cool are these?  Love the colors and versatility.  Work well too.  Bonus!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors, but the quality is so-so.  Great price though, so can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> okay.&lt;br /&gt;they work but they smear too much</li>
    <li> There is less than 3 centimeters of eyeliner in each pencil... What is the purpose of over charging for eyeliner that you can use in one week. Other than that, the quality is good but not enough for me to want to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great colors. I love them.</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty and a nice variety. But I didn&#x27;t realize these were so small. Though the pen is full size, the color is just the tip so it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Nothing about this in the description. Seems deceptive to me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these colors! The only thing is the tip is all u get in the liner! U can&#x27;t turn it to get more!</li>
    <li> these say they are glitter but theres no glitter in them or on the packaging at all the have no staying power and wipe off super easy some of the colors are very sheer and dont show up well and they took forever getting here i was disappointed in these</li>
    <li> these are great very versatile , can use for a lot of different makeup applications , was confusing how to sharpen at first.&lt;br /&gt;but very easy to remove and stays on decent if you eyes water</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she love&#x27;s all the different colors.</li>
    <li> nice and smooth. minimal traces of glitter.</li>
    <li> More than worth the price. Absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> easy to go one and last all day</li>
    <li> broke  all the way up to plastic edge the moment i apply to my eyes and dont  know how  to get any more  out of it  as  there no way to push it down  or push it out  no  way to twist it out  again  when i apply  you could barily see the make up on you  then top  it off it  make up breaks and now you cant  get any more maup out  of it and its first time i used it  so it was more wasted money again i am not a happy customer i would not recommend unless you dont mind wasting you money</li>
    <li> I really love these eyeliners. They are very bright, go on smooth and easy, blend easily, and of course are nice and cheap. Shiopping took a bit long, but since its being shipped from China, I really cant knock that off the actual product itselfs quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people have concerns about how they sharpen. I can confirm that they can be sharpened like a regular pencil in a regular makeup pencil sharpener, and also, that the makeup does all the way through the pencil! I tested that by sharpening the end of my least favorite color in the pack(at least on me) and after popping off the relatively thin colored cap at the end, you can sharpen the other end just at easily. These are are 12 FULL pencils, not just the visible tip or only a little bit behind it as some other reviews may suggest(I saw one review saying there was only 3cm behind the tip- this is not true.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A con of these pencils is that it can actually be a bit too soft. Sometimes if my wings are big enough theyll touch the crease of my eye and be smeared a bit there. This isnt really a problem if you seal your makeup, but its something to be aware of nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;Attached are a couple pictures of me wearing the bright red, pink, and chocolate brown from the pack for my eyebrows and eyeliner, a picture of the pencil sharpened from the other side to prove its a full makeup pencil to those concerned, and swatches of all the colors. All the lines on the swatch is just from one swipe, the pigmentation on all of them is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;apologies for the not so great focus in the pictures.</li>
    <li> Could have mention not resharpenable</li>
    <li> The pencils are great, besides the fact that two pencils arrived to My home broken in pieces</li>
    <li> Actually love the product, very smooth vibrant color. What I don&#x27;t love is that, you only get the tip you see. There is no more, you can&#x27;t shave the pencil, or twist for more liner. I got about 10 applications before it was gone :(</li>
    <li> these are nice nothing fancy but it looks nice on</li>
    <li> The color are soft and shiny...very beautifull... but there is just one problem I can&#x27;t figure out how to take out the tip Or is just this U get? Hopes not cuz then it is a waste of money because in just a few uses they will be no more usefull... I ll try to figure this out</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize you can&#x27;t sharpen these, limited applications.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed!  They arrived melted and with a disgusting yellow substance around the tip just like wax or some sort of dirtiness. I tried to sharpen them but because they melted I can&#x27;t get any of the stuff inside and the plastic hurts me when I try to line eyes or lips. I have read most of the reviews and most of them were positive. Sadly that isn&#x27;t my case :(</li>
    <li> I Sonica Sharma giving my true comment about this wonderful result about this product I am makeup artist and I use this on my self before trying on my coustmar you can&#x27;t belive this long lasting wear ypeeee truly amazing product</li>
    <li> I added these to my collection so that I could do fantasy make up, for the festivals and faires I work for, I was skeptical at first, and it took about a month for them to arrive, but they were totally worth it, I love these, super easy to use, fun to use, they don&#x27;t rub off, Soap and water with a bit of elbow grease take it off tho. These are soo perfect. Colors are vibrant, and fun to use.</li>
    <li> is good like but one used and put liquid in my face lol is k&lt;br /&gt;maybe I buy more soon</li>
    <li> I love them. The only flaw is they don&#x27;t retract so  its just this little bit to use once its gone there isn&#x27;t more you&#x27;ll have to buy more.</li>
    <li> I wish them waterproof</li>
    <li> I do really like the variety of colors. I was a little disappointed because they are not glitter pencils - they are more of a shimmery than a glitter. But, the pigments are pretty and you can&#x27;t beat the price. As others have noted, they can be sharpened!</li>
    <li> they are ok .. if they were retractable would be much better/ i would not call them glittery // but very afordable</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SO DANG MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to advance the pen to get to the rest of the color inside.  Maybe I should have gone with the pencils...</li>
    <li> They say glitter but are not and do not even color. When you use them they place no color</li>
    <li> Pretty good! Pretty pigmented, although colors fade easily. Have not tried to sharpen one yet, but pretty happy. Worth the 5 bucks</li>
    <li> I love this..They came earlier than I thought and they are highly pigmented... I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I must say they look awesome.. I wish they had more colors though</li>
    <li> These penciles are very good. I have used high end eyeliners and they are smooth when applied and colors are vibrant. They can be sharpened they just don&#x27;t look like the typical wood eye penciles. These are excellent I am ordering more right now.</li>
    <li> Delivered faster than expected delivery date! All the colors are working fine, pigmented, very easy to sharpen them just like colored pencils, getting 12 of them with little over $5 is sooooo worth buying. Better quality than those rolling up eye liner which is easily breakable. I have to admit that I used to hate pencil eyeliners, preferred rolling at d end, but this one is well protected by plastic kind material. Thumps up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten mine today and I checked to see how they worked! they work great worth the wait! the glitter ones are so pretty!</li>
    <li> These are not as long lasting as I wish they were, but the colors are quite nice. They are very creamy and glide on easily, without much tugging. I really love the selection of colors, especially for such a reasonable price. They are not as glittery as I expected, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the price still makes them worth it in my opinion, but they could use a better description &amp; instructions.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible, they are cheap and cannot be sharpened. Please do NOT buy you will regret.</li>
    <li> Two of them arrived broken but other than that they are amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I like them but it was to long to believed</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an incredible selection of liners. They are smooth, highly pigmented and apply well. They also arrived weeks before the estimated arrival date, which was a nice surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue that I really have with these, and the only reason they are not getting 5 stars, is that there not an ability to twist these when the pencil gets low. I have read from other reviewers that you can sharpen these but I the hard plastic has me wary. I will try it once I am low enough on a color but don&#x27;t want to risk ruining them in the meantime. If they sharpen well, I will change my review to a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smooth gliding liner (very easy to draw designs with for costumes, etc)&lt;br /&gt;- Great price&lt;br /&gt;- Large selection of colors&lt;br /&gt;- Crazy fast overseas shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Do not twist; very small amount of each product</li>
    <li> All pretty colors glides on smooth must have product.</li>
    <li> OK well I do like color eye and lip  pencil but it didn&#x27;t have any  glitter in it but I still like it u dont always get what u see</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Waste Your Money I Realize They All Were Broke When I Open The Package, Very Disappointed 😔</li>
    <li> Once again: Do not buy.  Once again: Do not buy. This is not what I was waiting for, and what was written here. Funny.</li>
    <li> Very low quality. Will never order this product again.</li>
    <li> The product itself is really nice! However I am not fond of the look of the liners they look like kids retractable crayons that don&#x27;t retract. I wish they would change the look of them! Yes I&#x27;m picky but I&#x27;m also a huge makeup addict and this just doesn&#x27;t appeal to me I believe a product should work but should also look appealing to the eye!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and you cant even roll the eyeliner up and they would not take it back this producr is very useless worked great but after you ran out of that first lil bit you could not roll it up</li>
    <li> The colors were great. The plastic pencil casings were all broken up and crushed when they arrived. they were practically useless.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and how smooth they go on. These are plastic and I didn&#x27;t know how to get to all of the liner that&#x27;s inside of it. I did some research and found out that these can be sharpened just like a regular eyeliner pencil. Just be sure that the blade in it is sharp.</li>
    <li> Love them the color is bold</li>
    <li> These do sharpen, not twist. I recommend using an eyeliner sharpener specifically, which you can find them at a dollar store or drug store very cheaply (I got one for $1.50 at Family Dollar that works perfectly). The colors are solid, creamy, smooth, and strong. They come off with a little bit of soap and water (or petroleum jelly). I use them for costume makeup as well as the black for regular make up. These are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it..It&#x27;s such a perfect liner. Goes on so smooth and soft. Arrived early.Looks just like the picture.Great for the price. Would definitely be buying again... Update: I re-ordered a few packs of these because i was so delighted with them the first time i ordered..however, my expectations were not met. This time what i got were not plastic pencils but wood pencils like normal eyeliner pencils. The colours were nice but there were some different ones from what i got first time (like the pic). I would not mind it but my favourite colour, the reason i actually bought these again was the purple which i did not get even 1 of in all the packs that i bought....so many 12 packs and all were the same colour scheme..i didn&#x27;t get any of the same colour scheme that i got when i first ordered. For these two reasons i was very disappointed.  The pencils themselves are still very soft and smooth. The colours that i got are nice too even though i would have been happier if i had gotten at least one pk that had all the colours as in the pic..</li>
    <li> Awesome deal... I am sure my sister will love them</li>
    <li> Not worth your hard earned money 2 uses of this product and it&#x27;s gone</li>
    <li> More for like a kid. Some of the colors are a little crazy. Easy to apply. Runs under your eye, When on lid color does not last long. It smears all over lid. Does not stay the line you drew. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a ONE TIME USE PRODUCT. NO SHARPENING, ONLY A SMALL TIP. Colors at great tho</li>
    <li> I love this product, you can use it for eyes and lips. The colors are beautiful, packaged nice. I would recommend this product to anyone. I&#x27;m going to order more just to stack up. The seller shipped this product out fast, it was worth the wait. I will order from this seller again.</li>
