### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great for showing my work</li>
      <li>great product and</li>
      <li>I have not tried them as nail tips yet, however they work great as acrylic nail forms.</li>
      <li>They are very nice additions to doing nails.</li>
      <li>Thank you.....was very satisfied</li>
      <li>LOVE THEM!</li>
      <li>You just have to buy your own items to do it.</li>
      <li>This product is very nice and arrived just as it should have and was well worth the price I paid and would order again!</li>
      <li>All in all, very satisfied with my purchase. :)</li>
      <li>it really helped me to make it almost perfect, even though my nails are more in the curvy side</li>
      <li>not bad i like this and over gel is good</li>
      <li>But if u do them in winter make sure is room temperture</li>
      <li>Maybe the ladies with fitting problems had wider square shaped nail beds?</li>
      <li>I love it how my nails comes out with this dual.</li>
      <li>but I am getting better.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m sure that with some practice I will get better at it.</li>
      <li>I will let you know more.</li>
      <li>These took about a month to be delivered and were safely packaged and light weight.</li>
      <li>, it gives a perfect angle at the cuticle so now abrasive filing afterward or obvious acrylic bump, and when the acrylic cures it can be pulled right off and it leaves a ridiculously smooth surface.</li>
      <li>Im a plus size girl, and these fit my nails fine</li>
      <li>so I had to file and smooth it out</li>
      <li>The largest size it comes in almost doesn&#x27;t fit mine</li>
      <li>I enjoy doing my on nails</li>
      <li>I do use these on nails they can fit, and they decrease the time spend doing nails once you get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>I know for a lot of people these are old news but for me, I never thought I could do my own acrylic nail until I started paying $$, I would have giving it a 5 stars but none of the form fit my thumbs, so I only made my 8 fingers, they are really easy to use</li>
      <li>One star off because I wish the sizes were more clearly marked</li>
      <li>These nails don&#x27;t stick right away.</li>
      <li>I recently started doing my own acrylic nails at home, and these are very easy to use and pull away easily from the dried acrylic nails, leaving a very shiny nail.</li>
      <li>Works very well!</li>
      <li>n pay more like at sallys for only $6</li>
      <li>, my nails look better than my last nail salon, I get to have a well made nails and not pay $$, I am in Heaven.</li>
      <li>Nails seem to be fine except that they don&#x27;t have a nail large enough for the thumb on my dominant hand.</li>
      <li>Smooth finish and comes right off once acrylic is dry.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t that wide, so I make sure to sculpt the sidewalls before and after.</li>
      <li>i really like this product because i don&#x27;t have time to go to a salon and do my nails.</li>
      <li>i really recommend it.</li>
      <li>I really like The clear dual nails but the only reason I gave them 4 stars is because I really wish they had bigger sizes other than that they work great!!!</li>
      <li>, I have long oval nail beds, so maybe that&#x27;s why they fit me.</li>
      <li>you get a good box strong  thick n hard nail tips.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how efficient it is.</li>
      <li>Click below for my how-to complete with a list of items you need to do the task.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>So far I am doing well.</li>
      <li>okay, I have actually tested it, but I thought I should let those who have big nail beds that these will not fit you.</li>
      <li>Although they ran a little small, overall it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
      <li>However, because I don&#x27;t like my nails long I have to go back and either sculpt a tip or file it down because I cut mine to fit the shape I like.</li>
      <li>They fit very small nails.</li>

<li> Cheapest, thin , awful , nail tips ever purchased some were split in half</li>

I do use these on nails they can fit, and they decrease the time spend doing nails once you get the hang of it. There needs to be bigger sizes in these. If you are not good at filing and buffing, and you have small nail beds, then try these, as for me, I don&#x27;t use them as often as I thought I would.</li>
    <li> Thank you.....was very satisfied</li>
    <li> These nails don&#x27;t stick right away. Not even in w/n two minutes...</li>
    <li> Did have a size for my thumb nail</li>
    <li> okay, I have actually tested it, but I thought I should let those who have big nail beds that these will not fit you. The largest size it comes in almost doesn&#x27;t fit mine and I have small nail beds. When I actually get to test them out I will let you know more.</li>

    <li> not what I was looking for. Product was not described well enough for me to understand fully how to use it.</li>
    <li> THEY DON&#x27;T HAVE NUMBERS LIKE THE PIC SHOW</li>
    <li> I found  these  on Amazon. I enjoy doing my on nails so when I found  these  I ordered  them so I don&#x27;t  have to go for a fill in. So far I am doing well. It does take practice but I am getting better. The only thing is the largest  form isn&#x27;t big enough for my thumb but I make it work. I have  discovered at several people use them on YouTube.</li>
    <li> not bad i like this and over gel is good</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like these but it was my 1st time using them &amp; I&#x27;m sure that with some practice I will get better at it.</li>
    <li> I love it how my nails comes out with this dual. But if u do them in winter make sure is room temperture</li>
    <li> Works well enough, but if you want these to function 100% as molds and have no experience these are not for you. They aren&#x27;t that wide, so I make sure to sculpt the sidewalls before and after. I like them because I have a habit of sculpting thin acrylics that snap, it gives a perfect angle at the cuticle so now abrasive filing afterward or obvious acrylic bump, and when the acrylic cures it can be pulled right off and it leaves a ridiculously smooth surface. However, because I don&#x27;t like my nails long I have to go back and either sculpt a tip or file it down because I cut mine to fit the shape I like. Still, it makes fills a breeze and cuts down on harmful acrylic dust and filing in general.</li>
    <li> I use these to make free-form gel nail extensions without gluing on tips or digging out nail forms! LOVE THEM! Click below for my how-to complete with a list of items you need to do the task.&lt;br /&gt;This is my review on the builder gel that I use with these dual forms.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A6SUX01BGA7C/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B007IX2DL6</li>
    <li> great product and it came on time! i really like this product because i don&#x27;t have time to go to a salon and do my nails. But with this i can do it by my self at a comfort of my home. i really recommend it. You just have to buy your own items to do it.</li>
    <li> Nails seem to be fine except that they don&#x27;t have a nail large enough for the thumb on my dominant hand.</li>
