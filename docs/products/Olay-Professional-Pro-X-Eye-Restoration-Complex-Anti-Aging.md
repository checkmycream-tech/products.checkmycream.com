      <li>It feels so good.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as good as Lancome.  </li>
      <li>Good eye cream.  </li>

      <li>Any good UNSCENTED moisturizer will work just as well.</li>
      <li>Good price.  </li>
      <li>good product.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a better choice, but if you are over 40, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great.  </li>
      <li>My girlfriend is pleased with this product, so if she is happy so am I. I will buy again.</li>
      <li>i have used olay products for many years and this olay product is great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten used to that consistency, though; and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I am so incredibly glad I purchased this!</li>

      <li>It was amazing to the degree</li>
      <li>I am loving the results from this product.  </li>
      <li>This is nice, goes on well, not greasy.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this product till Good Housekeeping finds a product that performs better.</li>
      <li>This is a nice addition to the routine for under-eyes.</li>
      <li>So on my way to work its working so that when I reach work, my eyes look nice.</li>
      <li>but I read the review of this product on Good Housekeeping more than a year ago and just couldn&#x27;t make up my mind if I wanted to try it.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied, it is good but not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
      <li>Even though I found the product effective, I&#x27;m not using it now because I realized it contains two ingredients I&#x27;d like to avoid--methylparaben and ethylparaben.</li>
      <li>Nice feel on the skin and blends in well.  </li>
      <li>look for what you like and what works best for you at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>shipping was very very very very quick, price was excellent, will recommend it to others family and friends, way worth the price</li>
      <li>This diminished that a whole lot, mostly through being an excellent moisturizer that stays put and doesn&#x27;t end up in my eyes.  </li>
      <li>The price was fair and shipping time just fine.</li>
      <li>super happy I found a product I love.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, with continued use, I will see more results.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>and this was at the top of the list.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and keeps my under eye area nicely hydrated.</li>
      <li>I use Clinique skincare which I love for cleansing but their eye cream doesn&#x27;t come close to this one.  </li>
      <li>However, being a product junkie means always searching for something better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After using this product for a week, I love it.</li>
      <li>This product works better than the high-priced products.</li>
      <li>At 52 I get many, many compliments about my skin</li>
      <li>I love this stuff....</li>
      <li>This product really does a great job in helping the wrinkles under your eyes and the crows feet.  </li>
      <li>It is better than any eye cream I have tried</li>
      <li>It continues to be my favorite place to shop online.</li>
      <li>As described, fast shipping, great product.</li>
      <li>I like the entire Pro X line and consider this product to be the best.</li>
      <li>This is a great eye cream and the price is reasonable.  </li>
      <li>and I have been pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Just discovered that Olay is one of the most notorious on the market for animal cruelty.</li>
      <li>but this one  is better in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I think it helps  9 more words required??</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite Olay products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Restoration Complex over a period of time lightened the dark circles under my eyes. The only thing better I wish it would do is tighten the skin.</li>
    <li> good product.  Like oontainer</li>
    <li> Product eliminated my puffy eyes. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a difference in the tone &amp; quality of my skin since I started using the line of Olay PROx products (been about a year now) - less wrinkles, skin looks younger &amp; softer. I use this in the morning along with the lotion - age repair SPF30 and the skin tightening serum. At night I use the hydra firming cream which I absolutely love makes my skin feel really nice when I go to bed and wake up the next morning. The eye cream is light, doesn&#x27;t leave your eyes feeling greasy but makes a noticeable difference in tired eyes and the little lines around the edges.  I have all of the items on subscribe and save which makes it really easy - never have to think about reordering. This eye cream lasts me about 2 months. Overall been very pleased and have not wanted to look at other skin care lines which, before finding this, I used to jump around and try new stuff every time I ran out of something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I love it. It is so rich and emollient. And the price is amazing here!!</li>
    <li> I used it during the day and my bags appeared larger, so I applied it at night before bedtime and voila!  Less bags!  Not completely gone, but this time, less is surely better!</li>
    <li> I see difference. It s been a few weeks only.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, thought with Olay Prox I found a product which would \\&quot;finally\\&quot;   work on puffiness &amp; dark circles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> used it for years. Love it. Will continue using it</li>
    <li> I paid $40 for this product, hoping against hope that it would help diminish my dark under-eye circles. It did absolutely nothing after one month&#x27;s of use. Worse, it made the wrinkles around my eyes worse. A complete useless and potentially harmful product (because it contains toxic chemicals in it, e.g., parabens). Might as well flush your money down the drain. 1-star is too generous; I would give the product a negative rating if such an option were available.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I have actually noticed a smoothing of the skin around my eyes.  Also good, this stuff does not migrate into my eyes, unlike a lot of other eye creams.</li>
    <li> Recieved product promptly. Olay Pro-x restoration complex works well reducing the puffiness under my eyes. You don&#x27;t need to use alot so it lasts quite a long time. Great price.</li>
    <li> The Olay eye cream in ok but I think that Avon has a much better product. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly suprised to see the Oil of Olay eye cream for such a low price.  I&#x27;ve seen it for 2-3 times as much in the stores.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR PUFFINESS UNDER EYE. I HAVE TRIED ALOT OF PRODUCTS THOUGH THE YEARS AND NOTICE A CHANGE IN A COUPLE WEEKS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using Regenerist eye serum for about a month and wasn&#x27;t happy.  I found that it didn&#x27;t absorb well and I wasn&#x27;t seeing any positive results.  Before returning to my very expensive stand-by Lancome eye cream, I decided to try Pro X.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as good as Lancome.  However, I like it much better than Regenerist.  It&#x27;s creamier and absorbs more quickly.  It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than Lancome so I&#x27;ll stick with it for a while.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to purchase this product.  She is not only very happy with the product, but it is also for her the first time to obtain the product through Amazon and for a much lower price then in a regular store.  So, wife is happy --&gt; I am happy --&gt; That&#x27;s what I call a Win Win.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product love Olay Pro-X series, will do business with this company again. I use twice a day and around my eyes definitely show improvement.</li>
    <li> I have been an OLay girl for years and love their products.  I think this could be less expensive but I try to buy when I get the $[...] rebate from Olay.  I would recommend this product to the over 50 age group especially.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late thirties. I have darks circles, slight puffiness and the beginnings of crows feet, wrinkles and sagging in my lids. For two months, I have religiously  used this eye cream twice a day in conjunction with the other Olay Pro-X day and night creams- I have noticed no results what-so-ever. I followed the directions. After a month, I began to do more research and tried exfoliating several times a week in order to promote better skin cell turn over- still no results. I switched to vitamin C serums and Retinol products last week- in seven days, my skin already feels different and looks healthier. Goodbye Olay.</li>
    <li> I did not see any change. I used it everyday twice a day for about a month. The bottle is empty now. The bags under my eyes are still there. I don&#x27;t expected any miracle, but common, for $40 I expected to see some result! Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This product contains parabens, which have been shown to promote cancer growth, thus I returned it to manufacturer for a refund (not yet received).</li>
    <li> This product is not as good as described and there is no useful for eye puffy and swollen, or black. So don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
    <li> I have a very big puffiness problem due to allergies, I hoped this product would help a lot, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much....   at first feels ok, but after a while it feels dry and doesn&#x27;t visibly reduce the puffiness....   mabye for people in late twenties or early thirties it&#x27;s a better choice, but if you are over 40, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great.  I tried very expensive eye products and ordered pretty much all that&#x27;s out there...  this product is just in the middle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not yet seeing any type of \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; with my eye area, but by the same token it&#x27;s not hurting or irritating anything either. Perhaps it just needs more time to work. The price was fair and shipping time just fine.</li>
    <li> I am a 39 year old guy. I have used a bottle of this at this point and just bought a second. I think it is very good. Not extraordinary as claimed, but certainly better than average. When I put it on, I see an almost instant result of all \\&quot;the bad stuff\\&quot; go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I do wish it had more of a lifting quality.  All they had to do was add a little more caffeine! That is really what is in all of the lifting/tightening cremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I like this. I will continue to use it till I find something possibly better.&lt;br /&gt;As far as over-the-counter eye products, this is, so far, the best out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for over 3 months, twice a day and didn&#x27;t notice any change. I don&#x27;t have a very-wrinkle problem (I&#x27;m 30) but hoped actual ones could have disappeared a little bit. Nothing happened. Puffiness and dark circles stayed as well. Will not buy another one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for while and I usually pay 100% at the local store.  this is a great price for a good product.</li>
    <li> I am certainly impressed by this product line. I have a lot of wrinkles for being 41. I have tried a fewer high end products and did not see the type of results I do with Olay Pro X.  I switched to using Olay Pro X Eye Restoration Complex, Deep Wrinkle Cream, and Age Repair Lotion SPF 30. I noticed a difference within 2-3 months. I am certainly impressed with the disappearance of my sleep lines that one has after a night&#x27;s sleep. I noticed reduced appearance of wrinkles under my eyes and around the mouth. However, I still would like to see a reduction for crow&#x27;s feet and between my eyebrows&#x27;s, so I am going to give the Deep Wrinkle Treatment a shot. Now If I can just make my hair grow brown instead of grey, I would be a very happy gal.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is light, goes on smooth, and does not cause me to break out.  You may need to re-apply once your skin as absorbed, a skin care adviser told me to always carry an eye cream in your purse and re-apply through-out the day, so I try to do at least 3 times a day.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream for months now and I love it.  I purchased it after top-rated reviews came out last year and this was at the top of the list. It is the best eye cream I have ever used and I have used a lot of them.  I use Clinique skincare which I love for cleansing but their eye cream doesn&#x27;t come close to this one.  This cream goes on smooth, is non-irritating, and it definitely reduces fine lines and wrinkles.  This cream has absolutely improved the look of the delicate skin around my eyes. I also love that a tiny bit of this product goes a long way which means you will have it for months -- therefore I feel the high price is justified though I hate paying it b/c I don&#x27;t believe in spending a lot of money on skincare. This is one cream though that I will spend money on -- I don&#x27;t even bother looking for other eye creams anymore.  Since I have tried so many, I feel that this and a good cup of green tea everyday is the best thing you can do to help ease the process of aging skin around the eyes.  Olay is a really good product line.  Over the years, I have spent countless thousands on skincare -- I finally \\&quot;wised up\\&quot; and realized I was being taken for a ride by these exclusive product lines touting \\&quot;miracles in a bottle\\&quot; etc.. Don&#x27;t fall for it -- look for what you like and what works best for you at a reasonable price.  This eye cream is one of those.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream and the price is reasonable.  The cream performs well to address puffiness and dark circles.  It keeps the eye area hydrated too.</li>
    <li> I would give this 0 stars if I could. After 2 days of use, this product made my eyes swollen, puffy, red, and itchy. I looked like someone had punched me in the eyes. This product is NOT designed for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, I am so happy to get the Olay Professional Pro-X Eye Restoration Complex and I got it with the best price!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to try this product, however needed something to help with the fine lines and dark circles under my eyes.  After using this for several months, I have to say I am happy with it! It has minimized the little lines that have crept up around my eyes, as well as minimized the dark circles!</li>
    <li> The whole Olay ProX product line is amazing.  Family and friends noticed how clear and smooth my face had become before I told anyone what I was trying!!  I started looking so much younger, than before I used these products.  Before I was using expensive products but they did not perform anywhere near as well as this stuff.</li>
    <li> I AM WRITING THIS FOR MY WIFE AND SHE GAVE IT 2 THUMBS AND 5 STARS.  SHE LIKES IT!</li>
    <li> This product dried up shortly after receiving it so I was only able to use it for a very short time.</li>
    <li> I have only used the starter kit for four days.  I started having irritation over the eyelids second time, third time burned and had to wash off.  Fourth time I woke up with eyelids almost swoolen shut.  And during the night neck burned so bad I couldn&#x27;t sleep so again had to wash off.  Apparently I am having an allergic reaction to it and will take it back today (I was an RN - so know the signs).  I had truly hoped they were minor side effects which would go away, but the eyes convinced me.  So this is a warning to be careful, all things powerful or chemical may not be for everyone.</li>
    <li> I am 62 yrs. old &amp; purchased this product because I have dark circles under my eyes, and a few wrinkles, but mostly for the dark circles. I have used the product for over 3 weeks. I use it in the morning &amp; at night, but have seen no noticeable change to my dark circles. Wish I could find something to fade them, but this product is not the one to do that.</li>
    <li> I like the eye cream better in a squeeze tube than the \\&quot;can\\&quot; it comes in with this order. It is the same cream and works the same way. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long. It is however almost 50% cheaper to order it from Amazon and I got free shipping!</li>
    <li> The only real benefit of this product is the B vitamins.  If you want to see dramatic results, buy a face serum/cream with retinol in it.  RETINOL is the answer to anti-aging!</li>
    <li> I am loving the results from this product.  The price here on Amazon with the Subscribe and Save is great and if you watch for coupons, they can really bring down the price.  I just used a $5 off on it making it a steal on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it is a white cream, not tinted like the regenerist one I used previously.  I like that it is untinted, because it is not just a &#x27;cover up&#x27;.  The product absorbs well into the skin and after a few weeks results have been noticeable in both puffiness being reduced as well as darkness below my eyes diminishing.  I would recommend this product if you want to try and diminish dark circles or discoloration below/around the eyes as well as reducing puffiness or bags below the eyes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it claimed it worked on dark circles. However when I got the product and was reading over the instructions it said the only claim it has to working on dark under eye circles is that when you massage it into skin its supposed to stimulate circulation? Wow I felt sooo cheated!!! :(  However it does make my eyes very soft and nice I guess.. I&#x27;m only 19 so I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles.    Also another reason why I decided to go with this product is because it said it has a 100% money back guarantee. I need to look into getting my money back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product, twice daily, for about 3 weeks and I can already see the difference in the puffiness under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried many different products for this issue, from the most expensive to the least, and so far, this has been the only one that really works. It isn&#x27;t a moisturizer, and I have to moisturize separately, but for the puffiness and even for slightly dark circles under the eye, Olay Pro X Eye restoration complex has worked miracles for me. I will continue to buy it, and I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have tried every . .  every eye cream on the market . . and after the first few minutes found this product to feel like it was making a difference . . seemed to feel tightening sensation.  Really opened up the eye area, especially the lids.  Gonna wait a few more weeks to see if it softens lines, but right now am completely satisfied.  This product combined with Olay resculpturing cream for the face and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Still trying it out after 1 month of use.Maybe a little better with the wrinkles,but not sure if it works as advertised???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Premier Dead Sea eye serum for months, and while I had some improvement with the wrinkles around my eyes, there just wasn&#x27;t enough to make me happy. I just turned 32 and was considering having laser done until I stumbled across this product. I am so incredibly glad I purchased this! Results, for me, began showing just after a week and not much change after a month. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  I am getting amazing results.  I am definitely a repeat buyer.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Have used this before and will buy this again. Price is better than i can get at retail stores!</li>
    <li> I have this in auto-ship so I don&#x27;t ran out. Good housekeeping rated this as the best eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay Eye Restoration Complex before -  having purchsed it in a drug store  - and am most pleased with it.  I ordered it from Amazon weeks ago because they sold it at a great price.  After waiting a long time for it to arrive I recieved the package yesterday and the bottle was empty.  I am not blaming Amzaon but the 3rd party they obtained it from Potential Dynamixx.</li>
    <li> At around 25, I started to notice fine lines forming around my eyes. So like most late twenty something ladies I tried product after product looking for the perfect potion to stop time and thus the lines of aging. At almost 30, I had tried probably 50 different jars, tubes and \\&quot;pens\\&quot; promising to \\&quot;turn back time\\&quot;. None of them left me satisfied that is until I found this little gem! Only three weeks in and I&#x27;m hooked. My eyes look more \\&quot;rested\\&quot; in the morning and the skin seems tighter. Plus, I looove the way it feels when I rub it in. Not greasy at all. Melts softly into the skin. It&#x27;s a must try. I&#x27;m glad I did! (Also, try keeping this in the fridge for those way-too-early mornings - feels wonderful!!!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for several (maybe as long as 5) years but recently developed a reaction.  Not sure if it&#x27;s me or if the formula changed.  It was excellent for years and may be great for you too.  I&#x27;m seeking a new product.</li>
    <li> Will not buy again. Does not work any better than the Regenerist products. I have also found out the Olay tests its products on animals. I will not support companies that tests on animals in the name of vanity</li>
    <li> Great price for a high quality product.</li>
    <li> Very good it is really nice.my wife very like it .The face feel many water and write.hope it can writer after weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving it two stars because it didn&#x27;t cause any adverse reactions around my eyes. It did practically nothing for the circles or bags and I used it twice daily for more than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Clinique all about eyes\\&quot; did a pretty good job when I used it in the past, and it was a lot cheaper than this product.</li>
    <li> I did the research, and so did Good Housekeeping Magazine, and they had it right - this under-eye cream really works!  The item came quickly, and I will re-order from them again.</li>
    <li> Having read all the Pro-X hype, I was excited about trying this eye serum. It is relatively dry, as you might expect of a \\&quot;complex\\&quot; rather than a cream. It soaks in immediately and could be worn under makeup. It is hydrating, but I prefer a heavier treatment at night. You could use this and then pat a heavier, occluding cream over it, which I haven&#x27;t yet tried. Given the price of this product, however, I still prefer Olay Definity Eye Illuminator for day use and something like Kiehl&#x27;s or Burt&#x27;s Bees Repair Serum (an underappreciated great product) or beeswax cream for night use. OTOH, I haven&#x27;t used it very long yet and I don&#x27;t have major wrinkles. For a miracle value-for-money, nothing yet beats the Olay Eye Illuminator, IMO. I should probably try both together.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Have used the product previosly.</li>
    <li> The skin around my eyes look better but the bags are still there. I am thinking I should look for different products.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks, but I do think it&#x27;s beginning to work. I notice less puffiness and a lightening of dark circles. Hopefully, with continued use, I will see more results. I use several Olay products, and I like them. They work.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time, in an undamaged package.  I will not finish the container in use and open the new one for at lest two months, so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve experienced the shipment that&#x27;s being rated.  But my numerous experiences with Olay tell me it&#x27;sgood.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly but it does not moisturize for longer than a couple of hours. I won&#x27;t try this again, it is too expensive and as far as diminishing wrinkles, not at all. I have used this product for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not an Olay person, never have been but I read the review of this product on Good Housekeeping more than a year ago and just couldn&#x27;t make up my mind if I wanted to try it. I tried other eye creams but they just didn&#x27;t work. I still had the bags under my eyes and the dark rings seemed to get darker. So I finally tried this after reading a review of it some where else where it was named the best eye cream to purchase. I shou!ld have bought it when I first read the review. It took down the bags under my eyes in about three days and I noticed a difference in the dark circles in about a week to ten days. Now I have no darkness under my eyes unless I have not gotten a full nights rest in days and have not used this in a about a two weeks or so. When I do use it, it takes away the puffiness in a matter of minutes. So on my way to work its working so that when I reach work, my eyes look nice. I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup so I don&#x27;t know how to review under those circumstances but I can tell you, this product is worth every penny you will spend on it. I have the back up bottle already and it last so long. Have been using it for more than three months now, not every single day but fairly consistently. Simply amazing!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s  pretty good for the money.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Have used this product under my eyes and have seen a significant increase in smoothness in those areas. This is a very effective product.</li>
    <li> Love how this product almost erases the little lines around the corners of the eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I can see a difference in the lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I naturally have dark circles under my eyes due to extra blood flow to that area. This product seems to be helping. Hopefully it keeps improving. I&#x27;ll update review with further results.</li>
    <li> I order this item but really I did not see any improvement with this item.  I would not order again.  The cost of this item way to expensive for the results.</li>
    <li> This is nice, goes on well, not greasy. I use it at night and have very sensitive eyes, this does not make me tear up. Lasts well. I have tried them all, and this is the best.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff....I have been using it for about 5 years now.  I use this in combination with the smoothing and deep wrinkle Pro-X creams. At 52 I get many, many compliments about my skin and I let other ladies know my &amp;#34;secret weapon&amp;#34;! Olay Pro-X!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a combo product containing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peptide complexes (Palmitoyl Dipeptide-7, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4) have the same specific peptide sequence of type I collagen;  Palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 has been found to stimulate production of certain types of collagen and glycosaminoglycans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niacinamide (vitamin B3) which has anti-inflammatory actions to helps with puffiness, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, blotchiness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caffeine also helps with under eye puffiness and is soothing to eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl acetate, also known as vitamin E acetate, which has beneficial antioxidant effects&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a week, I love it. It is smooth and silky. It isn&#x27;t greasy. My eyes look great and smoother. I don&#x27;t look tired anymore. I use it under my makeup and before I go to bed. I loved it so much, I bought the wrinkle cream for bedtime! :-) super happy I found a product I love.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a couple weeks and have yet to see any results. I use the other Olay products and love them so I was disappointed in this cream.</li>
    <li> I really like this new eye cream by Olay.   I get puffy eyes in the morning with a blue cast.   In the evening I used the eye cream and in the morning I had no puffiness and underneath my eye looked looked lighter with very little blue.   After trying many different eye creams including different ones by Olay, this is the one I am sticking with.   I have been using this product for over 2 weeks now and am very happy with the results.    As far as wrinkles though, I haven&#x27;t noticed that big of an improvement.   But I do think my eyes do look more youthful, so I guess it is helping with wrinkles but I was more concerned with the puffiness and blue cast.   Now, if I can only find a great neck cream!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic changes. All I really hope for is a moisurizer so my eyes don&#x27;t feel tight and wrinkled, which this product does nicely.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Its been 2 weeks and I see signs of improvement on the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream as part of my night-time skin ritual for several years. It&#x27;s pricey but lasts a long time. And while the effect may be somewhat psychological, I am convinced it is helping keep the area around my eyes soft, smooth and wrinkle free--and I definitely have mature skin. Overall, it seems like a reasonable investment in looking good longer.</li>
    <li> I love it, Olay Professional Pro-X Eye Restoration Complex Anti Aging is the best I use it everyday, it&#x27;s like a instead botox for a while.</li>
    <li> Check out Beautypedia. You don&#x27;t really need eye cream. Any good UNSCENTED moisturizer will work just as well. I recommend Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
    <li> WOW! I am a current user of Olay beauty products. I have tried their facial wash, cleansers, facial wipes and much more. I have been satisfied with the overall results of Olay Beauty Products. But, Olay really WOWED me when I tried this product. I am a Full-Time college student and had developed dark circles around my eyes. I did some research and found this Olay Professional Pro-X Eye Restoration Complex Anti Aging on amazon. After two weeks of continued use, I saw noticible results! My eyes are much lighter, much smoother, more firmer and revitilized! It&#x27;s pricey, However compaired to other products on the market that sell at a higher value, your pretty much getting the same thing, the difference maybe the brand of the product/price/oz. I prefer to purchase certain products from amazon, because even with the shipping included, it is still inexpensive compared to local stores that sell Olay Beauty products and to other competitive brands that offer the same thing! Overall, this Olay product earned 5 stars for: Quality, Showes Results and Price. Highely Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is now my main product for crows feet, fine lines , baggy eyes .&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day and it works great goes on pretty smooth it can leave a little bit of a white haze if you put on too much but if you just wipe the excess off or keep rubbing it in it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;But my eyes always look 100% better after applying. I have super sensative skin and it has never caused any breakouts I think its a great eye product.</li>
    <li> My most beautiful wife (59 years old but looks 35 years old) has used Olay products for years. She swears by the Olay Pro-X products. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Six months ago my wife and I tried Olay&#x27;s Eye Restoration Complex.  It was part of a package of three Olay products designed to combat aging (wrinkles, under eye \\&quot;bags\\&quot;, age lines).  We are both in our mid sixties and healthy.  Of the three products in the package we bought, we found that the Eye Restoration worked extremely well after using it for three to four weeks.  The swelling and dark circles under our eyes nearly disappeared.  We were surprised because we have markedly different skin tones (she is very fair and blond and I am Eurasian).  We also found that buying this product at Amazon saved us about 23% from the price available at CVS or Target where we usually shop.</li>
    <li> For some reason this is increasingly harder to find.  I discovered this product in the 2010 Good Housekeeping tests and surveys.  It is important not to have too high of an expectation as GH advises nothing in the eye repair category provided more than a slight improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 23 years old Asian. Perhaps you will ask, why would you start using this at such a young age?&lt;br /&gt;Well, women need to start do some skin prevention before it&#x27;s getting too late. Work and lack of sleep make my skin look older and drier, so I realize it&#x27;s time to find beauty producs to prevent my skin from aging quickly, especially skin around my eyes, the part where reveals your age easiest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to smoothe my start-to-grow wrinkles around my eyes, I bought the Olay restoration complex around 4 months ago and started using it once a day (Sometimes once every 2 days). After 4 months of using it, I can tell a difference that the wrinkles are fading away after application. The skin looks smoother and younger. I don&#x27;t have skin irritation using the product (I&#x27;m a normal-oily skin); the restoration complex doesn&#x27;t give me any overly heavy oily feeling as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after all, getting more rest and drinking more water are the most important, or else your skin will keep aging no matter what skin products you apply.</li>
    <li> I like the entire Pro X line and consider this product to be the best. You need to apply only a small amount to see results. I am in my 50&#x27;s and this product definitely softens the wrinkles and makes the eye area look more toned- with or without makeup. I have purchased this product 3 times and will definetly buy again.</li>
    <li> As described, fast shipping, great product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> purchased for my wife</li>
    <li> I was a bit surprised when I received the product as it is a small little pump bottle.  But, it only takes a very small amount to cover the area and the results are as advertised!  I have very sensitive skin and this did not bother me.</li>
    <li> Delivered timely and product was as expected and described</li>
    <li> As much as I like this product, you have to agree, it&#x27;s overpriced.     .5 ounces is not so much!  While I understand the supply and demand concept of Capitalism, and more so, women paying anything to look younger and better, I&#x27;m thinking this company is taking advantage of these concepts and charging way more than what it costs to produce it.     But if you have the money, the product did help alleviate some (not all) of the crows feet around my eyes.  But then, so does Suave Cocoa Butter body lotion which costs $2 for 18 fl. oz.     And as ALWAYS... Amazon.com is quick.  It continues to be my favorite place to shop online.</li>
    <li> This product really does a great job in helping the wrinkles under your eyes and the crows feet.  I would recommend it to anyone who want younger looking eyes.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any improvement with this product and it is very costly. I do not think it is worth the money. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream several years ago and I was happy with it.  However, being a product junkie means always searching for something better.  I never found an eye cream that works as well as this one.  I&#x27;m back to it after trying several other brands including creams that cost $100+.  I won&#x27;t stray again. It&#x27;s worth it to look rested.</li>
    <li> Easy to dispense, doesn&#x27;t waste product. Goes on smooth and keeps my under eye area nicely hydrated. Seems to have helped reduce crow&#x27;s feet. I didn&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkling to begin, just wanted a product to use under makeup that wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;gloppy\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> i have used olay products for many years and this olay product is great. every one should try this olay product.</li>
    <li> This product made my eye area break out.</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I expected. However, my mom says it works well so I guess that would explain the price for such a small container.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5(+/-) years. I will be 32 and inspite of staying up late for work or school-work related things, my eye area remains tight with no noticeable fine lines or wrinkles. Olay does live up to its name, imo, because I have also been using their facial cleansers, daytime/nighttime moisturizers and facial wipes.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is absorbed well into the tender skin around my eyes and I have used it for a number of years without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Just discovered that Olay is one of the most notorious on the market for animal cruelty. Awful, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. L&#x27;oreal has very similar products, and they&#x27;re safe. Going with that!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product but it will NOT reduce puffiness or dark circles.  It will however provide some important anti-oxidants, ceramides and solid moisture for sensitive skin.  There is no miracle in a bottle, you need surgery for that.  But it is a solid eye cream if your expectations are educated and real.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for years for moisturizing. They are great. This product did not impress me though. I will go back to my other eye cream. I do LOVE Olay though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference around my eyes!</li>
    <li> Good eye cream that absorbs quickly and completely.</li>
    <li> I love the Olay Pro-x products and the Eye Restoration Complex is great. It definitely softened the wrinkles around my eyes and tightened the skin on the lids.</li>
    <li> Hydrates well with out leaving my skin oily feeling.  I am not sure what more to say about  this product except that it is a good value.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, but it is light enough to not pull when applied.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pro-X products by Olay for a few years now, and think they work well.  I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and people are always mistaking me for mid 40&#x27;s. I have seen a reduction in the &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; lines around my eyes.  I will keep using the Pro-X products as long as they are available.  Getting them through Amazon makes them more affordable.</li>
    <li> I have used eye creams for years and have found this one of the best. I buy it on the subscription plan from Amazon and save quite a bit of money over drug and big box type stores. Really think this eye cream is fabulous. Nothing is going to remove the wrinkles but this does soften then.</li>
    <li> Bought on the recommendation of Good Housekeeping for its proven efficacy at a reasonable price. It is a teeny, tiny bottle, but it seems like it should last a few months. I love the consistency, the non-scent, and how moisturizing it&#x27;s been to my dry under-eye area this time of year. Too soon to tell if it will prevent wrinkles. Tends to pill a little bit if you apply under-eye concealer without letting it fully absorb.</li>
    <li> Good eye cream.  I have bought a few times.  I switch back and forth between this and Mary Kay products.</li>
    <li> It came on time and in the right amount. It works fine.</li>
    <li> Started using this product daily to address my dark/bags under my eyes.  Never saw any real positive change.  Will continue to use the product until it is gone but don&#x27;t think I would purchase again</li>
    <li> Olay Prox takes my puffy eyes and helps them depuff.  I use what is left over on my lips to moisturize them after brushing teeth and before bed.</li>
    <li> not worth buying i dont recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;im in my 20s and ive been using this for weeks i cant really see a difference.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from a very high end product and I am seeing much better results with this. It is recommended by most dermatologists I know and I can already see why.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS FINE TO KEEP UNDER EYES MOIST BUT NO BETTER OR WORSE THAN ANY OTHER  FOR THE PRICE I THINK ITS FINE</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pro-X line for a few years now and love it.  I live in Phoenix where it is very dry and these products keep my skin nice and moisturized.  This is a nice addition to the routine for under-eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an effective eye cream for years; I think I&#x27;ve found one! My eyes are a combination of puffy bags surrounded by dark hollows - this eye cream has reduced the puffiness, plumped up the hollow areas and made the surrounding wrinkles less obvious. What more could one ask? The consistency is rich without being greasy, and seems to sink into the skin rather than just lying on top of it.</li>
    <li> Just what we wanted arrived on time</li>
    <li> This eye cream makes my eyes puff up and makes them darker. I tried it for two weeks and after how horrible my eyes were looking stopped. A couple weeks later when my eyes looked normal again I tried it again and they puffed up and darkened immediately. It does the exact opposite of what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> No difference for me, but easy to apply.  Have to be honest and admit that I&#x27;m not the most consistent in applying this morning and night.  The eye complex seems to work well for other users.</li>
    <li> Olay&#x27;s Prox X products are very good and I have been pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for 2 years now. It works for puffy eyes. A little pricy though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and am very happy with it. For me, it has reduced and limited the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Pro X eye restoration complex for a couple of weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly with no pulling of the skin, one pump does both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The container is very light, I suspect there&#x27;s an inner container much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will make any difference to the skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I had been using another olay product for almost a year but i decided to give this one a try. i see better results in the few weeks than I did in a year of the other product.</li>
    <li> I bought a Clarisonic Opal and was letting my sister use it with this product. It was amazing to the degree this product combined with the Opal decreased her puffiness. It was a \\&quot;wow\\&quot; moment. My mother and I couldn&#x27;t get over the transformation. Since I have used it, my puffiness around the eyes has greatly decreased. Still puffy but part of it is just the genetics. Hopefully it will continue to improve. Have used about one bottle of this product. It is better than any eye cream I have tried and I have tried many that were much much more expensive.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is pleased with this product, so if she is happy so am I. I will buy again. Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> great product-great price</li>
    <li> I first sampled the Olay Pro-X product line a few years ago when they first introduced it.  At the time, they offered a significant rebate to encourage people to try it.  For nearly 20 years, I&#x27;d been a devoted user of Clarins skin care (their super-restorative creams/serums for anti-aging); but since each individual Clarins product was well over $100, I was definitely interested in finding something that would work as well but for a lower cost.  Over the years, I&#x27;d tried other highly-rated pharmacy skin care lines...only to be disappointed in how my skin looked after a few weeks of switching.  After a few weeks of using the Olay Pro-X line, I was pleasantly surprised.  While my skin didn&#x27;t necessarily improve, it continued looking as good as it did on the high-priced french skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorites of the Pro-X line are the Skin Tightening Serum and the Hydra Firming Cream.  However, I also use and am quite happy with their Wrinkle Smoothing Cream and this Eye Restoration Complex.  The eye cream seemed a bit odd until I got used to it.  Rather than the sort of oily feel of some eye creams, this Pro-X one has almost a waxy feel and look to it when you first apply it.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to that consistency, though; and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I could tell the difference from the very first time I put it on. I have trouble with under eye circles, but the Eye Restoration Complex really helps.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products on the market today. It really does work, and it&#x27;s such a great price.</li>
    <li> I have chosen becouse it was recomanded by my friend.&lt;br /&gt; I am satisfied, it is good but not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Yes i would recomend the product if you can not afford  expencive one.&lt;br /&gt;I have been experimenting with different products  to see how they work.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product by Olay I love how it makes my eyes look and feel. So easy to use too</li>
    <li> This product works better than the high-priced products. I tried many eye creams in the $200+ range, and then I came back to Olay Pro X. And there&#x27;s absolutely no scent to this product, unlike some eye creams that smell like dead fish all day. (Some of you know what product I&#x27;m talking about.) Try Olay; you&#x27;ll be very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use it in addition to my Kinara eye cream.</li>
    <li> This product moisturized well, but I didn&#x27;t see any change in the lines. I also saw no difference in darkness under eyes. I did see some improvement in puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I was encouraged when I read a lot of the reviews of this product, but after several weeks of using it, I see no visible difference in the bags under my eyes. I&#x27;ve used the Olay moisturizer on my face for years, and this product didn&#x27;t do anything more than that for me, but costs 3X as much.</li>
    <li> I love this as well as using around my eyes i also use it around my lips and neck. Fabulous results</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do any better than ordinary skin lotions that can be purchased at much lower prices. In my opinion is is a great advertisement program but the product isn&#x27;t any better than much less expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I like it alot and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> After about 3 months, I started getting results, that other&#x27;s could see, I&#x27;ve recently had several compliments that my skin looked great, I&#x27;m 52.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like it, but it doesn&#x27;t like me. Hurt my eyes and made my vision blurry. Others might not have this problem. I am going to try another Oil of Olay eye cream or serum.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye cream! I keep it in the refrigerator &amp; it feels so cool &amp; creamy when I put it on &amp; under my eyelids..</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve used all the expensive designer eye creams and this one is right up there.  It has the prefect consistency for me - not too runny and not too thick.  So why spend $60-$150 for eye cream when you can buy this on Amazon for $20.00?</li>
    <li> I really like this- not for deep wrinkles but great for a solid moisturizer that allows makeup to go on easily after you apply it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that visibly reduces under eye bags and wrinkles. Product arrived promptly and well-packaged from vendor.</li>
    <li> Gotta have it, gotta love it.  Anyone who has ever used it understands its superiority over any other cream ever.</li>
    <li> I have used MANY eye care products from drug store to high end department store to prescriptions from dermatologists. I love this product!</li>
    <li> 44 year-old male.  Started using it 2 months ago.  I hadn&#x27;t seen my sister in about a year and a half.  Her first comment was &amp;#34;what are you using?  Your skin looks great!&amp;#34;  (this + night resurfacing elixir + daytime regenerating lotion with SPF + deep wrinkle treatment - not all at the same time!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest improvement was upper eye lid.  Our family has eyelids that droop over time (upper eye lift covered by medical insurance as it eventually droops into our field of vision).  Mine had started showing folding/wrinkling, especially when I looked sideways.  This diminished that a whole lot, mostly through being an excellent moisturizer that stays put and doesn&#x27;t end up in my eyes.  Sometimes I&#x27;m caught off-guard when I feel like I have an eyelash and I gently wipe across my eye - the skin is so soft!</li>
    <li> shipping was very very very very quick, price was excellent, will recommend it to others family and friends, way worth the price</li>
    <li> I got this very quickly and have been using it for a while now. I  notice that the fine lines under my eyes are looking better now.</li>
    <li> I love it, it feels like is improving the skin around the eyes, smoothing and moisturizing, reducing and eliminating expression lines</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because  Olay Pro-X Eye Restoration Complex is a 2010 Good Housekeeping Anti-Aging Award Winner in the Best Eye Cream category.  The product works fine &amp; I don&#x27;t have any problem with it.  The price is right and the product arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I have had discoloration and some swelling under the eyes for a number of years. I am 68 years old, and after using this product for a month, the discoloration and bags have been reduced. I will continue to use this product, and, hopefully, the eye problems will be reduced more over time.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is smooth and comfortable to apply. I use it in combination with other eye creams, but this is the product I use both day and night. No harsh smells or irritation with my skin, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use this product for years to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an Olay girl for over 20 years and I&#x27;ve stepped up from Regenerist to ProX, so far so good :)</li>
    <li> Every time I try to use this product, I look worse.  While it may work for some people, it accentuates any lines/wrinkles I have.  I&#x27;m around fifty so I certainly don&#x27;t need a product that ages me.  It is really drying under the eyes -- I need moisture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of eye creams from Estée Lauder, Lancôme, Clinique - but this one  is better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought Olay&#x27;s Professional Pro-X Eye Restoration Complex after seeing it receive very high marks from a Good Housekeeping study of skin products.&lt;br /&gt;This product did help with fine lines and to some degree with puffiness. Even though I found the product effective, I&#x27;m not using it now because I realized it contains two ingredients I&#x27;d like to avoid--methylparaben and ethylparaben. Paraben is in almost everything, but I am looking for something without it because it is a known hormone disruptor.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested, here&#x27;s the list of the product ingredients as posted on the Olay site (Sept. 1, 2014):&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Dimenthicone, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Isohexadecane, Polyethylene, Caffeine, Isopropyl Isostearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Dimenthicone Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Dipeptide-7, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Dimethiconol, Stearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Peg-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Sucrose Polycottonseedate, Titanium Dioxide, Polysorbate 80, Propylparaben, Stearic Acid, Peg-4 Dilaurate, Peg-4 Laurate, Decyl Glucoside, Lactic Acid, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Peg-4, Citric Acid, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Ammonium Polyacrylate, Disodium Edta.&lt;br /&gt;I have read that the active ingredients are caffeine and niacinamide (vitamin B3). I&#x27;m happy those ingredients, but not the paraben--and I&#x27;d rather they left out the plastics if that were possible.</li>
    <li> Nice feel on the skin and blends in well.  I found that it works just as well as a more expensive eye cream but I am still looking for that perfect eye cream that does everything it says it will!</li>
    <li> Good price.  Arrived timely and love the product</li>
    <li> My wife has been using it for some time. Likes results! Started slowly but she stuck with it and is now showing results. Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> No difference - will  not buy product again.  Did not help with puffy eyes or dark circles at all.  Like other Olay products though.</li>
    <li> %This is one of my favorite Olay products. It feels so good.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and no crow&#x27;s feet!</li>
    <li> Still not sure what works best, but this is good stuff.</li>
    <li> Found this product rated on Good Housekeeping for solid results in small wrinkle erasing.  The product applies nicely and has a nice firm feel for hours.  I noticed that my eyes were slightly irritated the first day.  After a couple of days this has passed.  I have felt that it does some minimal changes in the appearance of fine lines and firmness around my 46 y/o eyes.  I will continue to use this product till Good Housekeeping finds a product that performs better.</li>
    <li> I get up at dawn every weekdays and I noticed that I was aging! I&#x27;m 50 years old, always took good care of my skin with expensive stuff. But after more than 2 weeks using this Olay product I see a clear improvement. It is easier to apply my eyeliner and eyeshadow when I go out. I put some just under my eyebrows not too close from my eyes. It&#x27;s not a total lift but hey, I like my eyes now. I recommend it. I used Dr. Renaud, Sothys, Lancome and Clinique before; it does the same effect for less money.</li>
    <li> Not my first tube.. will buy again.. I think it helps  9 more words required?? this is all i have to say</li>
