      <li>Love this product, great holding spray &amp; nice scent.</li>
      <li>Nice smell and non-sticky hold.  </li>
      <li>but I was overcharged as I did not get what I ordered and this spray does not give my hair the look or feel that I think is more suitable  for my hair texture.</li>
      <li>Very light and non-sticky.  </li>
      <li>You can add more for days where you need more hold and it doesn&#x27;t just keep building up.  </li>
      <li>I do not think you can do better than that.</li>
      <li>LOVE.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good hair spray, but it isn&#x27;t any better than what you could find in the drugstore.</li>

      <li>Goes on very light and still holds my fine hair.  </li>

      <li>and she was very thankful for my choice of hairsprays.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it and would like to find it in a travel size.</li>
      <li>It takes a little more spray than I anticipated at each use and I have gone through the can faster than I would like.</li>
      <li>It is so hard for me to find in salon&#x27;s in Grand Forks, ND.</li>
      <li>Holds, but not heavy or sticky.  </li>
      <li>It is not heavy at all.</li>

<li> I have very fine thin hair and often I am not happy the way the my hair looks.</li>
<li> First of all they sent the wrong formula.  </li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair before it dries.  </li>
<li> I finish it off with a firm spray.....</li>
<li> The spray makes my hair stiff and unnatural looking.</li>

    <li> Have used it for years!  Leaves no residue on scalp.  I finish it off with a firm spray.....great combo!  Arrived in just a couple of days!  I&#x27; d order again.</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray!!  I have been using it for a couple of years and LOVE it!!!!!  Great hold and not sticky!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray. It is not sticky at all. You can still move your hair after spraying it in. It is not heavy at all. It is so hard for me to find in salon&#x27;s in Grand Forks, ND.</li>
    <li> First of all they sent the wrong formula.  I ordered the shaping spray and they sent the extra hold shaping spray.  I have used the vavoom shapemaker for years and knew which formula I needed for my hair.  I was not charged the price of the extra hold but I was overcharged as I did not get what I ordered and this spray does not give my hair the look or feel that I think is more suitable  for my hair texture. The spray makes my hair stiff and unnatural looking.</li>
    <li> Very good &amp;#34;shaping&amp;#34; spray.  Very light and non-sticky.  It takes a little more spray than I anticipated at each use and I have gone through the can faster than I would like. Thus the 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> The best hairspray ever.  Nice smell and non-sticky hold.  Works good in humid Florida summer weather.  Will never go back to &amp;#34;supermarket&amp;#34; hairspray.  Well worth the price.  LOVE.</li>
    <li> Great product no build up no stiffness, great body shape maker, got my friends hooked on this stuff, been using it for years</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my purchase. the product is excellent. the price is fantastic.  and greatest of all i got it in the next 24 hrs which was unexpected and great surprise to me. thank you. good luck.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and, actually bragged about it to my mother over mother&#x27;s day brunch.  I do not think you can do better than that.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and it works really well. Makes it possible to brush through my hair the next day. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> Love this product, great holding spray &amp; nice scent. Combs out when re-styling. Does not leave your hair sticky. You really get your moneys worth.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of hairspray I will use.  Holds, but not heavy or sticky.  Just right!</li>
    <li> This hairspray and brand is so great! It holds.  I bought this for my friend that did my wedding hair and she was very thankful for my choice of hairsprays.</li>
    <li> If you want an extremely LIGHT HOLD this is it.  The product did not do as promised.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairspray for years.  Goes on very light and still holds my fine hair.  You can add more for days where you need more hold and it doesn&#x27;t just keep building up.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any water so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair before it dries.  On very damp summer days, I don&#x27;t think any hairspray will hold perfectly but this is the best I&#x27;ve found!!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good hair spray, but it isn&#x27;t any better than what you could find in the drugstore.</li>
    <li> been using for years. great stuff</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair and often I am not happy the way the my hair looks. I tried the Vavoom by Matrix and what a difference it made! My hair looks fuller and keeps it&#x27;s shape and looks great! I highly recommend it and would like to find it in a travel size.</li>
