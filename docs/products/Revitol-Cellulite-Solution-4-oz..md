### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>Revitol has been amazing for me!</li>
      <li>for almost one month that i am using this product and it is effective!</li>
      <li>just want to be honest!  </li>
      <li>If something is that good, why isn&#x27;t it sold in retail stores?</li>
      <li>The doctors and nurses commented on how nice my belly looked too.</li>
      <li>So, wear your sun block, and you should be fine!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle cream for sure.</li>
      <li>I know nothing will make it disappear , but this product makes it look better.  </li>
      <li>I wish they offered you a better deal than that.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, for sure.</li>
      <li>This is some really good stuff,I have tried other creams and cures for cellulite and this by far works the best.</li>
      <li>I got HUGE - I originally weighed 120 pounds and almost topped out at 200 pounds by the time I gave birth.  </li>
      <li>I originally ordered the Revitol cellulite cream from Revitol.</li>
      <li>Great product...starting to see visible results in a couple of weeks of regular usage...very good price as well, will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised of the amazing results and so quick.</li>
      <li>Although not as quickly as I had hoped, this stuff does work.  </li>
      <li>If you are happy with a less bumpy thigh, you should try this product.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s pleased with the results so far.  </li>
      <li>However if the new product is as good as the old one I will be the first to commend it.</li>
      <li>Amazon credited my account so they did me right.  </li>
      <li>If you want to see noticeable results, this is not the right product.</li>
      <li>My first order came in pump form.</li>
      <li>First I received expired product , finished the tube - no noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;Instead getting rid of cellulite</li>
      <li>, they sent me the product with two different printing, one with the original sliver printed logo and nice cap, but other one with the white printed logo, and the top of the cap is differnt too.</li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle already</li>
      <li>I gained more than any other woman in my family</li>
      <li>It is runny rather than rich and the ingredients are not the same.</li>
      <li>The cellulite is still there, but it appears less prominent.</li>
      <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t helped much yet.</li>
      <li>not thick at all</li>
      <li>I have to buy more now knowing how long it&#x27;s going to last.</li>
      <li>It was so hard to see during pregnancy that I had to be turned just right under the light to see them -</li>
      <li>What I wanted to let everyone here know is that using this product has a side effect of making your skin very sensitive to the sun.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I recently gave birth to my second son and used this product again from 4 months along twice daily with a body butter - Andalou Naturals - on top (I start showing at 9 weeks believe it or not).  </li>
      <li>and that was kind of weird to me at first</li>
      <li>but I do have just enough to make me feel self conscious in a swim suit, but Revitol really did make a diference.</li>
      <li>What I received was a thinner solution in a tube which seems to be what the company has replaced the old pump with.</li>
      <li>BUT I DID BUY DIRECTLY FROM THE COMPANY.  </li>
      <li>Being from a family where EVERY woman gets a ton of stretch marks (we&#x27;re from Scandinavian and Irish decent), I bought this stuff FROM THE COMPANY and started at about 5 months into my pregnancy and stopped about a month after I had my son.  </li>
      <li>This time I got a few very tiny stretch marks to the right of my belly button right where this kid was constantly kicking.  </li>
      <li>and I have seen major, major improvement.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t take away the deeper dimples but the more shallow ones seemed to fade away after about one week of twice daily dedicated use.</li>
      <li>I e-mailed seller shortly after receiving the product due to the consistency not being quite right and</li>
      <li>It is too early to judge results but the formula is different.</li>
      <li>and I barely see a decrease in cellulite.</li>
      <li>Due to the reviews was expecting a bit much I guess.  </li>
      <li>I guess you win some and lose some. :(</li>

<li> I guess you win some and lose some. :(</li>
<li> Strangely, I think my bottle is different from others as it&#x27;s quite watery!!!</li>
<li> I would not purchase this product again, complete waste of money</li>
<li> This seems strange to me that on Amazon it&#x27;s $15 and on their website</li>
<li> But I have only used this product only a few weeks.</li>
<li> Well, I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.  </li>
<li> I am on to my third bottle in two and a half months</li>
<li> but did I want to risk the wait while the deadly cellulite crept back?</li>
<li> It&#x27;s true the cream was thick and hard to remove from the bottle half way through.</li>
<li> I noticed the bottle was a pump &amp; completely different &amp; there were several people who commented that it was hard to get out &amp; the product was gone in less than 2 weeks.</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve already read in other reviews that this can happen, but my wife forgot when she went out today.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have extreme cellulite</li>
<li> I just wanted to redeem the product and hopefully other women can prevent stretch marks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Now after giving birth and with my body slowly shrinking back to (hopefully)</li>
<li> Ive been using it for almost a month, my dimples less visible.</li>
<li> I just think it&#x27;s a little pricy.</li>
<li> dont even waste your money.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few weeks as directed and can notice an improvement in my cellulite.  </li>
<li> I have been using this on a problem area for the past 3 weeks</li>
<li> Applied morning and night, in small amounts will make a difference, just give it some time.</li>
<li> A big disappointment but</li>
<li> The whole thing was annoying.</li>
<li> and they said it should be thick &amp; creamy.  </li>
<li> My wife was outside for around an hour in the sun with no sun block and received a very bad sunburn.  </li>
<li> It is quite expensive so when I saw it on Amazon for 1/4 of the price I immediately bought a tube.</li>
<li> They must be selling fake expired product..  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s impossible.</li>
<li> It smell really bad</li>
<li> Really bad product please don&#x27;t buy</li>
<li> doesnt do anything :(</li>
<li> Someone should report them that is very unhealthy and disgusting.</li>
<li> I hate the smell.</li>
<li> Very frustrated.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.</li>
<li> The product arrived damaged, it was almost liquid and the smell was terrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought 3 tubes of Revitol Cellulite Solution as I read you needed to use it for awhile to see results. Never happened. I used it faithfully, as directed, and did not see any changes in my thighs. My opinion is to save your money, especially as this is quite pricey.</li>
    <li> The seller shipped the product promptly. I e-mailed seller shortly after receiving the product due to the consistency not being quite right and the key ingredients not being listed on the packagin.  I never received a response back from the seller.  The product does not seem to work either. I guess you win some and lose some. :(</li>
    <li> I purchased Revitol Cellulite Solution in a non-pump bottle from Potential Dynamix.  The consistency was like elmers glue &amp; went on flakey.  After one use the tiny hole got clogged &amp; I had to use a pin to get it unclogged.  I called Revitol and they said it should be thick &amp; creamy.  Potential Dynamix referred me to Amazon where the product was stored.  Amazon credited my account so they did me right.  However, when they told me to try another seller like Health Buy I noticed the bottle was a pump &amp; completely different &amp; there were several people who commented that it was hard to get out &amp; the product was gone in less than 2 weeks. I wouldn&#x27;t mind spending the $39 Revitol charges on their official website but I can&#x27;t even see for myself if this cream works!  Very frustrated.  If something is that good, why isn&#x27;t it sold in retail stores?</li>
    <li> This seems strange to me that on Amazon it&#x27;s $15 and on their website it&#x27;s $40 a bottle, for the same 4oz size.  They must be selling fake expired product..  Someone should report them that is very unhealthy and disgusting.</li>
    <li> I am on to my third bottle in two and a half months and I have seen major, major improvement. My cellulite is almost gone! For faster results I started eating a low fat diet and massaging my problem areas before applying the cream. Revitol has been amazing for me!</li>
    <li> Great product...starting to see visible results in a couple of weeks of regular usage...very good price as well, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the ingredient list says it has Retinol A in the product.  But the actual product package states that it has Retinyl Plamitate, which is not the same product and does not offer the same benefits of Retinol.  A big disappointment but paying to ship it back doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, for sure.</li>
    <li> Being from a family where EVERY woman gets a ton of stretch marks (we&#x27;re from Scandinavian and Irish decent), I bought this stuff FROM THE COMPANY and started at about 5 months into my pregnancy and stopped about a month after I had my son.  I got HUGE - I originally weighed 120 pounds and almost topped out at 200 pounds by the time I gave birth.  I gained more than any other woman in my family so I should have gotten a ton of stretch marks.  I slathered this stuff on my belly, breasts, and thighs twice daily and followed it with a body butter cream I got from bath &amp; bodyworks.  I went through about 6 bottles of this stuff.  Well, I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.  The doctors and nurses commented on how nice my belly looked too. BUT I DID BUY DIRECTLY FROM THE COMPANY.  Looks like a lot of people had a problem with the seller on Amazon.  I just wanted to redeem the product and hopefully other women can prevent stretch marks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I recently gave birth to my second son and used this product again from 4 months along twice daily with a body butter - Andalou Naturals - on top (I start showing at 9 weeks believe it or not).  This time I got a few very tiny stretch marks to the right of my belly button right where this kid was constantly kicking.  It was so hard to see during pregnancy that I had to be turned just right under the light to see them - just want to be honest!  Now after giving birth and with my body slowly shrinking back to (hopefully) my former size, I cannot see the marks at all.  I did stop the product after I gave birth.  I still think this product is 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for the last 2 months or so, and it does appear to be working as advertised.  She&#x27;s pleased with the results so far.  What I wanted to let everyone here know is that using this product has a side effect of making your skin very sensitive to the sun.  My wife was outside for around an hour in the sun with no sun block and received a very bad sunburn.  The areas of her body that had sun block on did not get burned.  We&#x27;ve already read in other reviews that this can happen, but my wife forgot when she went out today.  So, wear your sun block, and you should be fine!</li>
    <li> I received 2 bottles $19.95 x  2 Total $39.90 sold by GSCM Ventures, Inc, they sent me the product with two different printing, one with the original sliver printed logo and nice cap, but other one with the white printed logo, and the top of the cap is differnt too. I did not open any of it yet, just want to return this order.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on a problem area for the past 3 weeks and I am beginning to see improvement. Although not as quickly as I had hoped, this stuff does work.  Applied morning and night, in small amounts will make a difference, just give it some time.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered the Revitol cellulite cream from Revitol. It is quite expensive so when I saw it on Amazon for 1/4 of the price I immediately bought a tube. The consistency was definitely creamier than the one I bought from Revitol and that was kind of weird to me at first but the results were the same. I don&#x27;t have extreme cellulite but I do have just enough to make me feel self conscious in a swim suit, but Revitol really did make a diference. It didn&#x27;t take away the deeper dimples but the more shallow ones seemed to fade away after about one week of twice daily dedicated use. I will continue to buy Revitol from now on!</li>
    <li> I tried this product just to see how it worked. I was very surprised of the amazing results and so quick. I started noticing changes after 10 days. Unfortunately I only bought one tube and that will not last you two weeks. I have to buy more now knowing how long it&#x27;s going to last.</li>
    <li> The product arrived damaged, it was almost liquid and the smell was terrible.  I&#x27;m very disappointed, I would never buy this product again!!!!!</li>
    <li> at last i found one product that not only helps to remove cellulite but affordable as well...for almost one month that i am using this product and it is effective! i am just amazed...i will keep continue using revitol  cellulite solution...</li>
    <li> This product works as described. I lost an inch off my waist &amp; it tightened my skin quite qell. It&#x27;s all gone now.    One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the pump did not work well. Maybe it should come in a jar you can open instead of a pump.</li>
    <li> First I received expired product , finished the tube - no noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;Instead getting rid of cellulite I got a lot of spider veins.</li>
    <li> Did not make any difference in the apparence as promised . I would not purchase this product again, complete waste of money</li>
    <li> I received the item promptly. Strangely, I think my bottle is different from others as it&#x27;s quite watery!!! not thick at all..sort of like diluted! I hate the smell. Ive been using it for almost a month, my dimples less visible.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cream for sure. It does seem to sort of help. It definitely made my legs feel smoother. I paid almost 30 dollars for it and I am out two weeks after. Two weeks is not even enough to see the results.  I wish they offered you a better deal than that.  I do like the stuff though. I just think it&#x27;s a little pricy.</li>
    <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t helped much yet. But I have only used this product only a few weeks. It does plump the skin some.</li>
    <li> doesnt do anything :( I am very disappointed. dont even waste your money. i want a refund for this product.</li>
    <li> I RECIEVED HAIR REMOVAL CREAM INSTEAD OF THE CELLULITE CREAM.  AND THEY WANT ME TO PAY TO SHIP IT BACK.   LOL</li>
    <li> My first order came in pump form. It&#x27;s true the cream was thick and hard to remove from the bottle half way through. But it worked, there was a difference in the texture and look of my skin.  The cellulite is still there, but it appears less prominent. So I ordered the reduced priced three pack. What I received was a thinner solution in a tube which seems to be what the company has replaced the old pump with. It is too early to judge results but the formula is different. It is runny rather than rich and the ingredients are not the same. Specifically there is no Retinol A listed on the back. I tried through the company website to contact a representative for feedback but it&#x27;s impossible. The seller offered to refund ... but did I want to risk the wait while the deadly cellulite crept back? No. So three tubes of who knows what are mine. The whole thing was annoying. However if the new product is as good as the old one I will be the first to commend it.</li>
    <li> If you want to see noticeable results, this is not the right product. I used the whole bottle already and I barely see a decrease in cellulite.</li>
    <li> This is some really good stuff,I have tried other creams and cures for cellulite and this by far works the best.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. It smell really bad and I felt sticky. Really bad product please don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Due to the reviews was expecting a bit much I guess.  No progress after two weeks, but I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks as directed and can notice an improvement in my cellulite.  I know nothing will make it disappear , but this product makes it look better.  If you are happy with a less bumpy thigh, you should try this product.</li>
