    <li> Found this at Target and fell in love..then couldn&#x27;t find it again.  I have ordered 3 and will continue to order it from Amazon as I run out.  I have tried tons of scented body washes and tons of organic/more natural body washes as well and this one is the most amazing.  Even my husband (a soap man) loves this.</li>
    <li> Really great for the skin! Everyone must have this body wash</li>
    <li> I liked this product ok.  It has a tropical smell similar to tropical flavored koolaid.  It has tiny little lava granules for exfoliating.  It was a bit pricey for the result.  It is also advertised as sulfate free, but it has sulfates as the 2nd ingredient.</li>
    <li> The smell is AMAZING! You will think you have died and gone to heaven! It&#x27;s the consistency of a sugar scrub, not harsh at all, could use it everyday without irritation. Leaves you GLOWING! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Even better it&#x27;s all natural, no harsh chemicals!</li>
    <li> Smells great, it was on time, and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out with it, even in Nebraska winters.</li>

    <li> Let&#x27;s pretend this is a mini hawaiian vacation in a bottle. I know a stretch. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells AMAZING. The scrubby things in it exfoliate well. Used on a poof this little bottle lasts forever. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell.  It smells cheap.  Sorry I ordered this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lightly body exfoliationg.  Smell is very nice!</li>
