      <li>/&gt;Thank you and very satisfied&lt;</li>
      <li>I think those who experience that problem may be using too much.  </li>

      <li>I love the distortion styling gum because it does not leave my hair sticky and tacky feeling like the other products I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I have thick, soft, fine hair and many products will flatten my hair if I use too much.  </li>
      <li>Then I take a little more to set my style</li>
      <li>I live in Florida</li>
      <li>but it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair is relatively short and I start by applying it halfway down the hair shaft toward the ends with my fingers, then I finish up with a little underneath at the bangs and at the crown where I have a really stubborn cowlick that causes a split (note that I don&#x27;t get any more product out of the tube).  </li>
      <li>Other products have not been as satisfactory and very sticky or makes my hair look oily.  </li>
      <li>and I can use a small dimes worth of product to style my hair.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t use too much, or your hair will be an oily, sticky mess.</li>

    <li> Good hair product I like the flexability it gives me to style my hair. Is alittle drying ? Overall great product</li>
    <li> This was an ok product, but I would not repurchase. You can&#x27;t use too much, or your hair will be an oily, sticky mess.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for my short spiky hair.  I love the distortion styling gum because it does not leave my hair sticky and tacky feeling like the other products I have tried.  I add a little to my hair while it&#x27;s wet and then hit with a blow dryer to style.  Then I take a little more to set my style and I&#x27;m good to go.  I can rework it in my hair and it never feels tacky.  I live in Florida and it still doesn&#x27;t get tacky with the humidity.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  For some reason, since I&#x27;ve had cancer treatment my hair responds differently to hair products.  I&#x27;ve gone through a ton of them and this seems to do the best job.  Four stars is only because I wish it had a tad more holding power...but it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I had to learn to use just a dab of the product otherwise my hair just looked greasy - took some practice</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  I had read that it had left some people&#x27;s hair greasy but that is not the case with me.  It works really well for my bangs and makes them easier to handle.  I have difficult hair - thick but fine.  Anyway, it is working for me.</li>
    <li> works great and fast fast delivery</li>
    <li> Works great for styling hair.  I use it on dry hair to pump up the hair a bit.  You only need a dime size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and very satisfied&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin</li>
    <li> Excellent product...will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This is really terrific stuff.  I&#x27;m really picky about my hair products and this is the bomb.  Makes my hair really shiny too!!!</li>
    <li> BEST EVER FOR SPIKING HAIR BUT ISNT STICKY</li>
    <li> great product.  Does not make hair stiff.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I will definitely purchase it again.  It&#x27;s light, but holds great.  Not sticky and easy to wash out!</li>
    <li> Great product, good value.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. So disappointed. Waisting money1</li>
    <li> I like the way it helps my hair look texturized, not greasy.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I saw this styling gum demonstrated on a video and wanted to give it a try.  I looked in beauty supply stores everywhere and could not find it until I looked for it on Amazon.  Although it is a styling gum, It looks more like a cream as you squeeze it out of the tube.  I have thick, soft, fine hair and many products will flatten my hair if I use too much.  After reading some of the other reviews, I chose to use just a small amount - maybe a little smaller than a dime.  Rub the stuff really well between both hands before applying it to your hair with a light touch. My hair is relatively short and I start by applying it halfway down the hair shaft toward the ends with my fingers, then I finish up with a little underneath at the bangs and at the crown where I have a really stubborn cowlick that causes a split (note that I don&#x27;t get any more product out of the tube).  Once I get the stuff on, I pull the hair around to arrange it and also back comb it a little at the crown for the split and to make it fluffy.  I end up with a piecey but controlled look which I like.  I usually wash my hair every other day and I use this styling gum on the second day which works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this styling gum does not feel gummy in my hair as some do.  I think those who experience that problem may be using too much.  In the video, they really slathered a lot of the product on, but I think you have to take into account the texture of your hair.  I am happy that the product washes out well, which also makes it a winner for me.  I really like this product and will continue using it.  Thanks, Amazon for carrying it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I have fine hair and I can use a small dimes worth of product to style my hair.  It holds my style.  Other products have not been as satisfactory and very sticky or makes my hair look oily.  This product  is not sticky and washes out without any traces left.  I am so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Well, I regularly buy this product for 14-15 bucks and now up to almost 50. My supply just ran out and I found out that they discontinued this wonderful product.  Anybody out there know/use a similar product to replace this brand?  This was the only thing that tame my curls and did not feel heavy, sticky or like-I-had-product on my hair.  Supremely bummed!</li>
