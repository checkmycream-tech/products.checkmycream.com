      <li>This is good stuff!</li>
      <li>and I use it with the Primed and Poreless primers by two faced which are also great.</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>Great for humid, summer weather.  </li>
      <li>i love this powder!  </li>
      <li>but does do a nice job to prep for make up</li>
      <li>It set my makeup nicely, but I felt like it paled my expression even though it&#x27;s supposedly translucent.</li>
      <li>Love love this good powder u don&#x27;t look ashy or anything I use this with too faced face primer for oily skin and is really good</li>
      <li>Achieve perfect results using the new Powder Pouf Brush created specifically for Primed &amp; Poreless Powder application.</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!</li>
      <li>Very light feeling.</li>
      <li>However, my pores are quite obvious underneith my foundation despite my best efforts!</li>
      <li>I love Too</li>
      <li>The product works well to give an airbrushed finish if applied on top of mineral foundation.</li>
      <li>It also allows more hours before getting oily.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I bought this.  </li>
      <li>I use a primer, dust this over it and then do my foundation/concealer routine and dust it over top of that.  </li>
      <li>This product really works great at hiding your pores.</li>
      <li>I tried so many powders (lots of $$$)</li>
      <li>I am so glad I bought this.  </li>
      <li>It is fine and is very absorbent and leaves a beautiful finish.  </li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
      <li>A silky, translucent finishing veil that adjusts to any skintone while minimizing the appearance of pores and fine lines.     </li>
      <li>The shipper did a fine job though</li>
      <li>just fine.  </li>
      <li>It has made a huge difference for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Too-Faced products, but this one I felt so-so about.</li>
      <li>I will use a light bit of Too</li>
      <li>also it has no base color to it</li>
      <li>Too Faced primed &amp; Poreless powder did none of that and for me its worth a bit more $ for it.  </li>
      <li>This goes on so smooth and light that it feels like you have nothing on, yet it covers well and is buildable.</li>
      <li>THe finish it leaves is smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling</li>
      <li>that it go&#x27;s on so light &amp; fine, lets your skin breath a little and is great for Florida humid weather.</li>
      <li>I love Too Faced products and find most of them very useful, especially their Primed and Poreless Powder...</li>
      <li>Great product although a little light.</li>
      <li>A good quality loose powder.</li>
      <li>This is a good product for setting your make-up or to use alone, doesn&#x27;t cake up, helps with fine lines &amp; helps a little w/pores, but please note it will not help</li>
      <li>You need to be careful and make sure you apply this very lightly, otherwise it will look like you have a chalky residue all over your face.</li>
      <li>Poreless left did not add any unwanted color, but most importantly did not leave my face looking washed out.</li>
      <li>It is worth the price</li>
      <li>All &amp; all it works fine with older skin  </li>
      <li>This is a great finishing powder that offers good coverage and requires minimal touch-ups compared to other powder products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>im pretty sure my skin feels smooth due to my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>On top of Amazing Face foundation it does make my uneven skin tone and large pores disappear, but I definitely don&#x27;t like the paling effect.</li>
      <li>What it does: Primed and Poreless Powder contains a high-resolution, reflective powder technology that transforms skin by visually minimizing pores, fine lines, and imperfections for an airbrushed-looking finish.</li>
      <li>really sets your makeup for a finished look.  </li>
      <li>like the cream version much better&lt;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>However, this product irritates my nasal passages so much, I have had to stop using it.</li>
      <li>Also, I don&#x27;t think you get a whole lot of product for your money, so I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;ll repurchase it.</li>
      <li>I love other products from this company but not the powder.</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast and the I would definitely do business with this seller again!</li>
      <li>I will use this to set my foundation only and continue my search for a better primer for larger pores.</li>
      <li>OTC &amp; Dept Store brands - even ones for older skin and</li>
      <li>and it comes with a cute little brush(&#x3D;</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without the tinted moisturizer.</li>
      <li>if you get a bit too much it is easy to use a brush &amp; dust off a little, some bronzer will still be applied &amp; won&#x27;t come off</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s easily fixed with a bronzer, blush or even the Too Faced powder foundation.    </li>
      <li>As far as the powder, I&#x27;m at a loss as for what this is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>and I have searched high and low for a product to control my shine.  </li>
      <li>I love the container as well, since you can slide and close the powder vents, leaving less of a powdery mess to deal with.</li>
      <li>Just a light dusting over my makeup with a big fluffy brush left my skin looking soft and set my makeup to last throughout my 8 hour work day.</li>
      <li>It left my skin with a soft matte finish.</li>
      <li>Although this powder really works at making the skin smoother, it does not really do a lot to hide my pores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So happy since I found this powder as I haven&#x27;t had too use an oil control base primmer since. This is a good product for setting your make-up or to use alone, doesn&#x27;t cake up, helps with fine lines &amp; helps a little w/pores, but please note it will not help w/larger lines - use a filler. All &amp; all it works fine with older skin  just fine.  I&#x27;m 51 w/min wrinkles - Oily Lt-med tone skin.  Use it lightly especially on darker skin.  I like that it go&#x27;s on so light &amp; fine, lets your skin breath a little and is great for Florida humid weather. I will use a light bit of Too Faced bronzer over it, and if you get a bit too much it is easy to use a brush &amp; dust off a little, some bronzer will still be applied &amp; won&#x27;t come off but a little bit will come off.  I sometimes then apply a really tiny bit of the primed &amp; Poreless powder over the area.  I tried so many powders (lots of $$$) OTC &amp; Dept Store brands - even ones for older skin and either they made my skin itchy, cakey or oily &amp; clogged up. Too Faced primed &amp; Poreless powder did none of that and for me its worth a bit more $ for it.  One container of it last about 9 months &amp; for me so that&#x27;s pretty good.  I can wear it all day not be itchy and the application lasts. I&#x27;ve paid more for a bad look!

    <li> Great product although a little light.</li>

    <li> I am so glad I bought this.  I have extremely oily, acne-prone skin and I have searched high and low for a product to control my shine.  I legitimately fill up an entire beauty blotter with oil at least 3 times a day, and this has been a miracle worker!  I am so glad I bought this.  I use a primer, dust this over it and then do my foundation/concealer routine and dust it over top of that.  It has made a huge difference for me.</li>
    <li> i love this powder!  a little goes a long way.  really sets your makeup for a finished look.  also it has no base color to it so it will work with any tone of foundation.</li>
    <li> Very light feeling. No color so it doesn&#x27;t change your foundation shade. I bought it in loose &amp; pressed.</li>
    <li> The packaging itself is a little trickey to get the powder on to the brush but after that it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Too-Faced products, but this one I felt so-so about. It set my makeup nicely, but I felt like it paled my expression even though it&#x27;s supposedly translucent. I looked like I had a very fine film of rice powder on my face, like the base for geisha makeup. On top of Amazing Face foundation it does make my uneven skin tone and large pores disappear, but I definitely don&#x27;t like the paling effect. However, it&#x27;s easily fixed with a bronzer, blush or even the Too Faced powder foundation.    A good quality loose powder.</li>
    <li> I purchased the primed and poreless powder on the recommendation of a rep at the ulta store.  it can be blended with your mineral foundation, or applied as a finish over your complexion makeup.  I like the setting effect, but it does seem to pale you a bit, and its a little too matte.</li>
    <li> This product really works great at hiding your pores. The shipping was super fast and the I would definitely do business with this seller again!</li>
    <li> I bought this to counter act the forehead shine I deal with every afternoon. I put it on over and under my mineral foundation and it has helped a lot.</li>
    <li> buying this product on amazon is a rip off when you can buy it on sephora.com for half the price $15 and it comes with a cute little brush(&#x3D;</li>
    <li> The product works well to give an airbrushed finish if applied on top of mineral foundation. It also allows more hours before getting oily. However, this product irritates my nasal passages so much, I have had to stop using it. When I apply this powder, the small amount that I breathe in leads to irritation. I have not had this problem with any other loose, mineral, or silica powders.</li>
    <li> Great for humid, summer weather.  Controls sweat to some extent and minimizes the look of pores.  I would use it only in summers, especially if you tend to have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love other products from this company but not the powder. It&#x27;s too cakey. Not natural like say, the other poreless products. The shipper did a fine job though and I would buy from again. Just not this product.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! It helps my makeup last longer, not transfer onto clothes, and hold off that shiny/oil look. I&#x27;d highly recommend it! (I dust it over my foundation of Dior Airflash)</li>
    <li> Love love this good powder u don&#x27;t look ashy or anything I use this with too faced face primer for oily skin and is really good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a finishing powder for quite some time and I think I have finally found it! Too Faced Primed and Poreless left did not add any unwanted color, but most importantly did not leave my face looking washed out. Just a light dusting over my makeup with a big fluffy brush left my skin looking soft and set my makeup to last throughout my 8 hour work day. It left my skin with a soft matte finish. I love the container as well, since you can slide and close the powder vents, leaving less of a powdery mess to deal with. All in all, I would definitely recommend this powder to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love Too Faced! This goes on so smooth and light that it feels like you have nothing on, yet it covers well and is buildable. I won&#x27;t go back to any other brand now. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!</li>
    <li> Just picked this up from Sephora...im pretty sure my skin feels smooth due to my moisturizer. However, my pores are quite obvious underneith my foundation despite my best efforts! Blah! I will use this to set my foundation only and continue my search for a better primer for larger pores.</li>
    <li> I love Too Faced products and find most of them very useful, especially their Primed and Poreless Powder...I couldn&#x27;t live without the tinted moisturizer. As far as the powder, I&#x27;m at a loss as for what this is supposed to do. It might be that I&#x27;m applying it wrong, I just don&#x27;t find it useful and actually makes me a little pale.</li>
    <li> This powder is like nothing I have ever tried before.  It is fine and is very absorbent and leaves a beautiful finish.  THe finish it leaves is smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling like is has a thick mask on your face.  It is worth the price and I use it with the Primed and Poreless primers by two faced which are also great.</li>
    <li> product works well but drying to skin&lt;br /&gt;I like the cream version much better&lt;br /&gt;goes on very dry but does do a nice job to prep for make up</li>
    <li> Although this powder really works at making the skin smoother, it does not really do a lot to hide my pores.</li>
