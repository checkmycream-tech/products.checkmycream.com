      <li>Has good amount of nice colors and for the price I am pleased.</li>
      <li>The polish removers included with the set are also nice to my surprise.</li>
      <li>Pros:  - Nice color selection.</li>
      <li>- Nice packaging.</li>
      <li>it comes with smell nice</li>
      <li>Variety of colors is nice.</li>
      <li>some of the lighter colors like neon orange dont crackle as well and are a bit more watery but still look good.</li>
      <li>The polish was very easy to use and started cracking almost immediatly.</li>
      <li>If you love cracked bail polish you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!!!</li>
      <li>Again, I am pleased both with the seller as well as the product itself.</li>
      <li>Cons:  - Even after our best efforts, a friend and I could only produce the smallest of cracks.</li>
      <li>and you get so many cute colors.</li>
      <li>so them toes can stay looking sexy..</li>
      <li>I ended up purchasing the OPI &amp; China Glaze crackle polishes and love them.  </li>
      <li>The polish remover is also really cute</li>
      <li>The designer/manufacturer is just going with a theme, so it&#x27;s okay for children to use.</li>
      <li>For this price though I can say I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>Love the nail polish but more so their customer service.</li>
      <li>I will definately purchase more of these.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
      <li>When I received the product I was very excited.  </li>
      <li>I got this really quickly and it had even more product than was advertised!  </li>
      <li>and there are so many that I am having to really search my nail color supply to find good colors to go underneath the crackle...</li>
      <li>The colors are bright and really cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was expecting by some of the other reviews that this would be a great purchase!</li>
      <li>Other than that, no complaints, the colors look awesome!</li>
      <li>They crack well, much better than OPI, whose crackle polish I find to be lacking compared to the great quality of their regular polishes.</li>
      <li>Everything else in the kit was fine.</li>
      <li>The ones that are not dry, work great.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for the great price and product.</li>
      <li>The best we could come up with with applying a bottom coat of one of the included colors, then applying a top coat (not included) of clear polish, then adding a second color.</li>
      <li>I then wished i could find a crackle polish in more colors than the six I had, but wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to find them anymore after all nearly a year had passed since that Christmas.  </li>
      <li>- The six extra nail polish removers in my package were a great touch.</li>
      <li>I received all crackled perfectly unlike many more expensive brand named polishes with less than perfect results.  </li>
      <li>These are great, and very economical compared to the price that you may expect to pay for a single bottle of crackle polish in stores.</li>
      <li>The packaging could of been better, I thought it would be in a nice big box</li>
      <li>I checked all the polishes to make sure they weren&#x27;t broken and they were all in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>The nail polish worked great and came in a wide variety of colors.</li>
      <li>I work part time and after bills don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend, but after adding together how much it would cost to buy most of these colors separately, decided to purchase this set.  </li>
      <li>cool colors          </li>
      <li>/&gt;-looks really cool when it cracks&lt;</li>
      <li>The colors are rich and bold, what every girl wants in her nail polish.  </li>
      <li>but if u are just buying this for cheap crackle paint, this is for u, the polish doesnt crackle as fast  as i thought it would</li>
      <li>WELL WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
      <li>None were dried out, and most were of perfect consistency and the one or two that were a bit thick for my liking were easily thinned with polish thinner.  </li>
      <li>Deffinitely recommend this to anyone who wants a really cool look without all the effort.</li>
      <li>AND my first order got lost &amp; I never received it</li>
      <li>but overall satisfied.</li>
      <li>After checking all the stores and discovering how expensive it was, this seemed like the best choice.</li>
      <li>I use these all the time and the color range is different and interesting.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I would have given a positive review.</li>
      <li>The colors are strong and lasting as well.  </li>
      <li>If this happens to you, just add a little nail polish remover (or polish thinner, if you&#x27;re fancy) and it will be almost good as new.</li>
      <li>I thought I made a smart purchased.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that in ordering such a large amaount, be sure to check every nail polish when it comes!</li>
      <li>Came in a nice little organizer which is always helpful</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Chips very easily without clear overcoat&lt;br /&gt;- takes a long time to crack</li>
      <li>well         shipped fast          </li>
      <li>My daughter just absolutely loves this crackle polish.  </li>
      <li>you want it to crack, put on different nail polish THEN put this on top, then apply clear overcoat to avoid chipping,&lt;br /&gt;IF you DON&#x27;T want it to crack, put on</li>
      <li>I was so excited to open up my crackle nail polish.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for myself, really wanting some new nail polish.</li>
      <li>The crackle polish at the department store worked much better, though it was much more expensive.</li>
      <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much from them, but they removed three coats of dark colored nail polish with relative ease.</li>
      <li>The nail polish is super fun, it needs a little help to crackle</li>
      <li>but once you get the routine down it&#x27;s sweet!</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t as thick as China Glaze, so make sure you really load your brush up in order to get the color that you see in the bottle.</li>
      <li>but instead it came in seperate little clear cheap plastic boxes.</li>

    <li> The nail polish works great, creates a great crackle effect. The only downside is that in ordering such a large amaount, be sure to check every nail polish when it comes! I found that three of mine were chunky and almost unusable. If this happens to you, just add a little nail polish remover (or polish thinner, if you&#x27;re fancy) and it will be almost good as new. Other than that, no complaints, the colors look awesome!</li>
    <li> Pros : cool colors          crackles well         shipped fast          came with all 24 bottles none were broke    cons : came with no black yellow  or white       : did not come with the six scented nail polish removers       : contacted seller about nail polish remover 3 times          responded once and ingored me after that so far its been almost two weeks since ive herd back .     so i wasnt very pleased with customer service , however the polishes are great ! :]</li>
    <li> When I received the product I was very excited.  I thought I made a smart purchased.  When I started using the product it was very disappointing, it did not work  like I thought it  would.  Next time I would just buy OPI even though the product is a little bit pricey.</li>
    <li> These are great, and very economical compared to the price that you may expect to pay for a single bottle of crackle polish in stores. I got both of the color options offered in these 24 bottle sets and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! They crack well, much better than OPI, whose crackle polish I find to be lacking compared to the great quality of their regular polishes. These 2012 polishes crack as well as the China Glaze crackles, but lack some of their opacity. These aren&#x27;t as thick as China Glaze, so make sure you really load your brush up in order to get the color that you see in the bottle. The polish removers included with the set are also nice to my surprise. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much from them, but they removed three coats of dark colored nail polish with relative ease. I did get floral scents instead of fruit, however. You won&#x27;t be sorry you picked this one up, so if you&#x27;re considering this set don&#x27;t hesitate. :)</li>
    <li> Pros:  - Nice color selection. The colors are rich and bold, what every girl wants in her nail polish.  - The six extra nail polish removers in my package were a great touch. This makes it a great gift.  - Nice packaging. Each container had it&#x27;s own thick blue net cradling it.  Cons:  - Even after our best efforts, a friend and I could only produce the smallest of cracks. Granted, there were cracks all over the nail, but not nearly enough of the bottom color would show through. This was after playing around with several different methods. The best we could come up with with applying a bottom coat of one of the included colors, then applying a top coat (not included) of clear polish, then adding a second color. Still.. disappointing. The crackle polish at the department store worked much better, though it was much more expensive.</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s:  - came within 3 days of my payment  - Extremely well packaged  - crackles decently  - pretty colors    Con&#x27;s:  - Smells gross (not like normal nail polish)  - the colors arent the same, i have no yellows, black, or white    So basicly if u are looking for salon quality like OPI, u might want tolook somehwere else but if u are just buying this for cheap crackle paint, this is for u, the polish doesnt crackle as fast  as i thought it would but it just takes longer to dry than some other products ive used and the nail polish removers are FABULOUS!!!!! the pads are as thin as paper and feel dry but remove the nail polish exceptionaly well. i would reccomend this to anyone 15 and under as far as gifts go but if its for urslef and for fun its a great steal! so yes!!!! i would buy again!!!!!! The darker colors like the purple and browns seem to crackle the best. some of the lighter colors like neon orange dont crackle as well and are a bit more watery but still look good. BTW! thats my thumb up there with the purple and teal!!!! isnt it pretty???? :D</li>
    <li> I ordered this for myself, really wanting some new nail polish. The colors are bright and really cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-cool colors&lt;br /&gt;-nail polish remover works GREAT and smells AWESOME&lt;br /&gt;-lots of colors&lt;br /&gt;-cheap&lt;br /&gt;-looks really cool when it cracks&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Chips very easily without clear overcoat&lt;br /&gt;- takes a long time to crack&lt;br /&gt;- when it cracks, makes a mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;If you want it to crack, put on different nail polish THEN put this on top, then apply clear overcoat to avoid chipping,&lt;br /&gt;IF you DON&#x27;T want it to crack, put on just this nail polish THEN put on a clear overcoat as soon as it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Painting!!</li>
    <li> My daughter just absolutely loves this crackle polish.  She loved this gift.  Came in a nice little organizer which is always helpful</li>
    <li> Great selection of every color and the value was amazing!!And added bonus of the nail polish remover pads were a great addition to her gift and very useful!! my daughters favorite Christmas gift!!</li>
    <li> My niece opened her nail polish kit gift and the silver nail polish was dried up and half empty. I think the bottle must have been slightly open or not closed tight enough and it dried up during transit. The nail polish remover wipes were also slightly dry. Everything else in the kit was fine. I emailed the seller several times asking if we could return just that bottle of nail polish and the wipes and get a replacement bottle of silver nail polish and wipes. No response. I&#x27;ll just buy my niece a completely separate bottle of silver nail polish to make up for the half empty one, but I was really disappointed that I never got a response. Otherwise, I would have given a positive review.</li>
    <li> awsesome polish there wasnt a color that i didnt want or like. The colors are strong and lasting as well.  Thanks so much for the great price and product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to open up my crackle nail polish. It came a day earlier than expected too. I checked all the polishes to make sure they weren&#x27;t broken and they were all in perfect condition. They did a very good job with packing. The polish remover is also really cute and I can&#x27;t wait to use it. The polish was very easy to use and started cracking almost immediatly. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the look I got. No way I&#x27;m paying $5 for a bottle of crackle polish this stuff works perfectly and you get so many cute colors. Deffinitely recommend this to anyone who wants a really cool look without all the effort.</li>
    <li> I got this really quickly and it had even more product than was advertised!  Love it!  The nail polish is super fun, it needs a little help to crackle but once you get the routine down it&#x27;s sweet!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the purchase. It is for a gift for my niece. Has good amount of nice colors and for the price I am pleased. The packaging could of been better, I thought it would be in a nice big box but instead it came in seperate little clear cheap plastic boxes. but overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was going to purchase this for a sweet little girl...until I saw the colors: \\&quot;Sinner, Sun god, prophecy,\\&quot; etc. Um, no thank you. This is terrible marketing.</li>
    <li> If you love cracked bail polish you&#x27;ll love this! It has every color you can think of. It has crazy colors and some normal colors. The nail polisih works great. I bought this for my best friend for Christmas but I&#x27;m always borrowing colors from her.</li>
    <li> I heard about crackle polish at a salon, some ladies were talkkng about it so I came home and Googled it, o found this! I LOVE LOVE.LOVE it!!! It&#x27;s so neat watching the polish crackle I tried like 10 out of the 24 the day I got them. The fun part is finding the perfect colors to mix match!!! I even.gave the link.to.this site to a nail salon!</li>
    <li> Have a teenager who was desperately wanting some crackle polish for her birthday. After checking all the stores and discovering how expensive it was, this seemed like the best choice. Was VERY nervous about the quality prior to ordering and couldn&#x27;t find any info on this brand online. After receiving the product, we have painted our nails countless times and even painted neighborhood friends&#x27; nails. Great quality and Great price!!!</li>
    <li> Polish did not crackle well at all, was too thick and clumpy.  Attempted to use a couple of times and bottles were drying up.  Horrible product I wish I would have returned.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter birthday party goody bags was a big hit! The nail polish worked great and came in a wide variety of colors.</li>
    <li> I am a teenager who purchased it for myself. The selection of colors is great and you receive all the colors that are shown in 4 packages of six. Delivered in under a week after the order was placed. The quality was great of all the polishes although if the base coat is COMPLETELY DRY it will remove it when you put the crackle on. it crackles well also. I&#x27;ve seen complaints about the names of the polishes and the names come from the 2012 theme of the world ending. The designer/manufacturer is just going with a theme, so it&#x27;s okay for children to use. The removers are flower scented, not fruit, and they contain a cuticle oil that helps your nails so it&#x27;s a plus! WELL WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> Its pretty poor quality, the nail polish is very thick and it doesn&#x27;t dry very hard, so it is easily scraped off, both accidently and on purpose. Now I have a ton of these and nothing to do with them, I would hate to just toss them in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Product was not what I was expecting. The colors look great from the bottle but when you put It on the nail it comes out dull,</li>
    <li> My wife like to get her nail done all the time so I went out and order it for her so them toes can stay looking sexy.. LOL</li>
    <li> Shipped within 2 days. Came in a neatly organized package with crackle nail polish in containers. Very good price considering OPI crackle is $8.99 a bottle. Glad I bought it! Scented nail polish remover it comes with smell nice but it takes a few pads to remove all your nail polish. Glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product.  It doesn&#x27;t look anything like it shows on amazon.com.  The nail polish doesn&#x27;t crackle and the nail polish remover pads do not work.  It also doesn&#x27;t include the base polish that it says is needed to make sure the nail polish crackles.  It is horrible and was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love the nail polish but more so their customer service. I ordered it yesterday, and asked them if I can get it as early as possible because I needed this for party favors next week. I got it overnight! They were very prompt with emailing me back as soon as I emailed them. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Half the colors were dried out and those colors that weren&#x27;t didn&#x27;t work very well at all.  I ended up purchasing the OPI &amp; China Glaze crackle polishes and love them.  Don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever buy and off brand nail polish like this again!</li>
    <li> One Christmas I received a mini set of 6 of this product and although I had never heard of this brand was very skeptical of it.  I had purchased several brands of crackle nail polish that really didn&#x27;t crackle. Or it crackled in such a way it looked like I  had fallen asleep with my nails still sticky and my polish had wrinkled it was that bad.  In the mean time I began getting into nail art, and collecting polishes; metallics, shimmers, cremes, glitters, etc and ended up with a lot-virtually any color one can envision and separated them by season and colors.  I had put the mini set give to me that Christmas in their respective bags with like colors intending to use them when I got to them figuring they would mediocre rather than trying them out.  Well, I came across one and decided to try it half-heartedly, and to my amazement, the color i tried crackled beautifully! It was amazing! I then wished i could find a crackle polish in more colors than the six I had, but wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to find them anymore after all nearly a year had passed since that Christmas.  I was told the set was bought on Amazon, so on a whim, searched out this brand to see if it was still sold.  I found the singles, and was going to buy some, that is until I found this set! I work part time and after bills don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend, but after adding together how much it would cost to buy most of these colors separately, decided to purchase this set.  And I am glad I did!! The order was put in, which arrived much sooner than I expected.  All bottles were intact, useable, and packed well in these 4  little plastic containers which separated into six bottles per container.  None were dried out, and most were of perfect consistency and the one or two that were a bit thick for my liking were easily thinned with polish thinner.  I have used a few and just as the mini set  I received all crackled perfectly unlike many more expensive brand named polishes with less than perfect results.  Again, I am pleased both with the seller as well as the product itself. Thank you very much!!!</li>
    <li> Variety of colors is nice. The ones that are not dry, work great. But I did get a few dry ones. For this price though I can say I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> The colors are great! and there are so many that I am having to really search my nail color supply to find good colors to go underneath the crackle...</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t review it as I have STILL not recieved this product - 2012 Cherimoya Crackle Crack. I am very disappointed and my daughter is so upset as it was her birthday gift; I would greatly appreciated reciveing the RIGHT item.Have been waiting over a month at this point.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time and the color range is different and interesting. I will definately purchase more of these.</li>
    <li> I was expecting by some of the other reviews that this would be a great purchase! Boy am I ever disappointed..... I don&#x27;t know whether I got some old bottles of polish or what but every single color is crap! I&#x27;ve used crackle nail polish before so I know how it&#x27;s supposed to work and this stuff does not work! And it dries within seconds and goes to this weird multi toned dried out look. Then within minutes the polish actually starts to lift up off your nail. AND the order says non-returnable so I&#x27;m out of luck. AND my first order got lost &amp; I never received it so I had to wait weeks for this second order to come. Boo!</li>
