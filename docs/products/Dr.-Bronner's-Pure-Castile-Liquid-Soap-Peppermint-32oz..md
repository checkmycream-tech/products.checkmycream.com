<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the smell of this soap, its multi-purpose usefulness and the fact that it recieves a good score from EWG.org for having few chemicals - that is why I give it three stars. BUT it is very drying for my skin and expensive, so i had to take off two stars. I also tried the eucalyptus one to see if that would help, but it didn&#x27;t really fare much better for keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap.  Smells good and gives a nice cooling sensation when you dry off.</li>
    <li> I love the way my house smells and looks when I use this stuff to clean the floors, baseboards and bathroom!!! This strong cleanser without the burning chemical smell. It leave surfaces shiny and leaves a wonderful fresh mint smell in the house. My dad&#x27;s housekeeper was using pinesol - there were multiple times I arrived shortly after she&#x27;d cleaned the kitchen floor and I found the smell overwhelming. I brought over a bottle of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and she was skeptical until she tried it. Now she&#x27;s a Dr. Bronner&#x27;s fan too! (and so is Dad!)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Never really thought twice about soap until I used this a couple of years ago on a camping trip. Now I won&#x27;t use anything else if I can help it. Feels tingly when you use it and I never end up with dry or oily skin. You only have to use a small amount as it suds up really well! Product smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a doused in perfume odor. Works great as body wash, laundry detergent and even as a general household cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, if you have a Trader Joe&#x27;s nearby you can actually but this product for less $)</li>
    <li> So refershing in the morning! Shower with this and you will not only feel refreshed but smell wonderful.  I also used it to clean around the house as recommended and it is a great alternative to using chemical cleaners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don&#x27;t appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I&#x27;m returning the product because I don&#x27;t want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it&#x27;s a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I actually wanted to buy this product.  (...)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this soap already and it came so on time I was surprise Love it</li>
    <li> This is all we use now.</li>
    <li> Very cooling on hot days when using in the shower.  The cool feeling stays with you for a long while.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Peppermint soap of Dr Bronner for years. I use nothing else and I love it. I always make sure I have a few bottles so I do not run out. I take it to the gym everyday. Richard Blue, PhD Psychologist</li>
    <li> The only flaw of this product is the way it squirts out of the dispenser -- straight out. If you can manage this, then the product is a great soap, that cleans universally, with instant lather and a great scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this stuph for years. Before I actually started using it.&lt;br /&gt;In 1997 I bought a quart (32oz) bottle to use at my virgin trip to Burning Man, because it was eco-friendly and versatile. I could wash myself, my clothing, &amp; my dishes.....and eventually used it to wash the playa dust off my car when I returned home.&lt;br /&gt; I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;This is the prefect soap for use with Hard water, it also leaves you feeling clean beyond what regular soap can do (with no soap scum or filmy feeling on you or the shower/tub!).&lt;br /&gt;For personal bathing I recommend diluting 50/50 with water. I use it to wash my hair, but Dr Bronner&#x27;s alone makes my hair/scalp dry; so I follow up with conditioner/conditioning shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Even diluted for bathing, less than ONE TABLESPOON can do your entire body.....one bottle for just bathing can last almost a year!&lt;br /&gt;I started bathing my kids with it as an alternative to the expensive Baby Soap. One Half-Ounce (~10ml&#x3D;10cc) is enough for a full bathtub and get 2 clean kids.&lt;br /&gt;Another side benefit is that after bathing, your bathroom smells absolutely Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Fragrance is way too strong........Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)...I threw it out!~ I prefer Myers Geranium scent!~</li>
    <li> love the peppermint smell; especially for bodywash &amp; hand soup; hair soap use may require its paired pH conditioner</li>
    <li> I love this, I use it as a body wash and love how the peppermint makes my skin feel after a shower</li>
    <li> I used this as shampoo by using 2/3 soap and 16 ounces brewed green tea.  It left my hair clean and fluffy soft. I use an ACV and water rinse afterwards. I can&#x27;t go a day without shampooing, and was really hating all the harsh chemicals in most shampoos and conditioners. I love that this soap can be diluted with water or tea into a wonderfully pure and natural and VEGAN shampoo. Also, the shampoo doubles as a face and body wash in the shower. And you smell like peppermint. YUM...</li>
    <li> Nothing but the best, wash my face, and body and WOW so refreshing and clean feeling. Skin feels so nice afterwards A+A+A+A+A+A+ My favorite is Peppermint, my husband loves it too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful!!! I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> There is no other soap that is so versatile and refreshing as this. Living in the South it is a plus as you leave the shower feeling cool.</li>
    <li> Although overall I do like the product, I have noticed after several weeks of use that it has started to irritate the more sensitive skin areas (underarms, face and nether-regions). After not using it on those areas for a few days, the irritation did go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be in the minority on this - my skin may be overly sensitive to one or more of the ingredients - but it may not be perfect for everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this stuff my entire adult life... since 1979.  There are 1001 uses for it. My main use this time is going to be making a homemade flea &amp; mite dip for my dogs with other essential oils and sulfur... and... making a flea repelling yard spray because this soap will incorporate cedar oil very well when diluted with water and can be used in a sprayer bottle system for the yard.  Other than that I&#x27;m looking forward to a nice cool shower after a hot sweaty day of garden work and let the peppermint tingle all over like an ice plunge when you run the cold water after soaping up with this stuff. What&#x27;s not to love about this soap?  As one of my friends used to tell me &amp;#34;it&#x27;s hippy trippy&amp;#34;.  These days it&#x27;s just considered &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; and common sense.  I hope that trend continues.</li>
    <li> This soap has a nice, strong peppermint smell that wakes you up in the morning and gives a nice, energizing zing. It rinses well and cleans well. I have bought this directly from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website, which I highly recommend, because they did not mess up my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have not been so lucky with Amazon. Within a month of signing up for Amazon Prime, I received two botched shipments. One was for an order which I had cancelled on the Amazon website within five minutes after mistakenly placing it.  The next was with this shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of sending me two 32 oz bottles, they sent me one. I made a phone call, during which I was put on hold several times for about five minutes each. The woman who answered the phone was quite pleasant and promised me I would get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got the email to confirm the refund, but instead of refunding me half the cost of this item, they said they would refund an amount that was two dollars less than what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite disappointed with Amazon. Not a good track record of customer service for this Amazon Prime customer.</li>
    <li> Wow this soap is amazing!  The smell is fantastic - very strong in the shower, but it mellows out.  Also - it tingles!  I use it on a loofah and wash all over my body and I feel clean and refreshed.  Just recently I decided to try it on my face (my sensitive skin/acne-prone face) and wow am I amazed.  Two days in and my skin is amazing!  Soft, clean, and finally starting to decongest.  Just as a note here - I only apply it to my face with my hands - I think using a washcloth or face brush would be too much.  Although this seems to dry my skin out slightly, it&#x27;s not too bad, and a very lightweight lotion cures that fairly quickly.  Now I think I&#x27;m going to try using it elsewhere - according to their website you can use it as a household cleaner - including in your laundry!  Wow, this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product  quality and performance. :)  My wife loves this soap because its all natural, and I appreciate the positive message on the label.</li>
    <li> I love peppermint soaps and shampoos, and this one is pretty good. It does leave a little bit of that tight, dry feeling you can get from bar soaps, but if you dilute it with a little it works quite well. My problem is more with the label and all of the strange, religious nonsense all over it. I&#x27;m sorry, I just don&#x27;t want a weird religious lecture from my soap and it makes the label hard to read if you&#x27;re trying to figure out the directions for recommended use. But having said that, if the label doesn&#x27;t bother you, it&#x27;s a good, healthy, natural product that you can use just about anywhere.</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for a good alternative to the pricier shower gels I have been using.  I have used the peppermint and lavender scented soaps for the past few years, and really love the mild scent and the gentleness of these soaps.  You really don&#x27;t need to use a lot on your wash cloth to get a good clean.  If you&#x27;re looking for a better alternative to those other shower gels with all of those chemicals this is a great product to try.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap that I have ever tried.  I don&#x27;t know about others but I like my skin to feel squeaky clean with no left over residue.</li>
    <li> These bottles are $ 15 at the vitamin shop...when they have them in stock.  So 2 for $ 21 is, shall we say, awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is like an air conditioner for the skin.  It wakes you up in the shower and you smell so minty fresh when done!  It does leave your skin dry, so to combat this I use (in the winter) the Body Shop Scrubbing oil and (in the summer) Skin so Soft oil (to ward off mosquitoes) which will stop the skin from drying and seal in that shower moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this soap for the face, even if you have oily skin.  It would dry out the face.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this soup it feels amazing on my skin. After i started using it i only shower with this soup and sometimes even wash my hair. I have a skin condition that is very painful however this soup helps a lot!!!!!!!!!!! I sometimes just leave it on my skin over night and it works better than the creams my doctors give me. I use it pure because it works best for me however its recommended that you add water because it is so fresh. You wont regret buying this soup. Best purchase ever</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale at Target (about $9). I used it on my hair and I was VERY pleased. I have long, dense hair that tangles easily. Because of this, I normally prepoo my hair before shampooing. But I didn&#x27;t have to do that since this contains a mix of different oils. I also like that you can use this for many other things as well. I would definitely recommend this to others! And I plan on purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> This soap is thoroughly refreshing. After I work outside in my garden, I love taking a cool shower while using this soap. It&#x27;s cool and a real pick-me-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will caution you that it definitely can irritate sensitive areas like the lady-parts, but it is otherwise wonderful. Just keep it out of your eyes like you would any other soap. It gets my hair squeaky clean, but maybe a little too much. I prefer regular shampoo because this seems to over-strip the oils from my hair if I use it too often. From my experience, it&#x27;s best used with a netting bath scrubbie. It only takes a tiny bit to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a good general cleaner. Be forewarned that full-strength it is powerful stuff. I&#x27;d labeled a bottle of it with a Sharpie and it took the marker right off the plastic in no time. Read the directions and follow them.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been a staple of mine for years.  You can look online and see so many uses for it... I really like it and appreciate its value.  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s was at one time a thicker product... but still a good product to have around... and it still goes long way as well, just maybe little less strength as was several years ago.  Yes, yes, everything has either gotten smaller for the price or lost some of it&#x27;s potency.... our economy!!!  But this is still a good value for the bucks....</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for years and can highly recommend it.  Even used sparingly it lathers well and is gentle enough to wash your hair yet good enough to get you clean.  The nice, not too strong, peppermint scent does not linger on the skin to interfere with an aftershave or perfume.  Be advised that a little of this liquid soap goes a long way so don&#x27;t feel the need to splash it all over to do the job.  The plastic container is break proof if dropped in the shower and the squirt top allows for application without waste.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I have read reviews how this isn&#x27;t the same old soap it used to be. But, I see no difference. It works great, smells wonderful and is just the best soap I have ever used in the shower. I recommend this soap to anyone looking for a natural alternative. It lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need much if you use a shower puff to wash with. Just be careful around certain parts of your body. If it get in there it might be uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> The best Soap on earth!</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for the shower and such a nice cooling effect in the hot &amp; humid days.  It is mild and really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Love the pepermint soap.  I mix it half and half with water and put in in the foaming hand soap dispensers.  The smell is fantastic and I&#x27;m not using harsh chemicals or Triclosan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than ten years and always looking for good prices.  There are many varieties of this product within this company but this one is the best and cheapest.  As usual it came when expected.</li>
    <li> The Good:  My wife introduced me to this soap a few years back and I&#x27;ve been a believer ever since.  I use it every day, from the shower to the camp site and everything in between.  I&#x27;ve even used it to wash my hair and yes, even once to brush my teeth.  It&#x27;s fantastic and it leaves me feeling tingly clean without dryness or annoying fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  It is somewhat expensive when compared to other soaps and, in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t exactly do everything it says it can.  For example, brushing my teeth with it wasn&#x27;t that fun of an experience and with my thick oily Italian hair, I do need a traditional shampoo to make it squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> Purchased the foamer pump along with it and use it in the shower. The hemp peppermint...simply put into one word...invigorating!</li>
    <li> great price on Amazon, multiple uses for sure</li>
    <li> I love this product but i over payed:( Go to wholefoods for 11.99 each of this size. Ooops</li>
    <li> I moved away from harsh chemicals when my husband and I found out we are expecting. I used this for EVERYTHING ... dishes, cleaning the shower, face wash, body wash, etc. It smells great and our stuff comes out cleaner than ever before. A bottle isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; but it lasts forever with a multitude of uses so it also means less clutter around the house. I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it. P.S. It smells great!</li>
    <li> Love the feeling on your skin</li>
    <li> This soap is great, you can can use it to clean just about anything. When using it as body wash it makes your skin feel tingly and it spells great.  I purchased a bottle here on amazon, and also at trader Joes (32 oz bottles for just 9.99). The baby mild is great for washing your face.</li>
    <li> 40 year fan, prefer the liquid to the bars.  Only lesson to pass along is be sure to keep cap closed.  Enjoy</li>
    <li> keeps inflammation down in my knee.....only thing keeping me walking</li>
    <li> We use this as a great morning wake up in the shower.  Smells great and leaves skin feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry our skin like many soaps do.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how wonderful this liquid soap is (and the bar soap is not shappy, either, but definitely get the liquid). Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is one of the few soaps/gels with scent that doesn&#x27;t irritate my super-sensitive skin. Most gels and soaps make me itch or get dermatitis. Not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minty smell is a joy. Makes you feel so clean. And it lathers like nobody&#x27;s business. A little goes a loooooooooooong way. Many gels claim the same, but it&#x27;s a fib. This one really lathers like crazy. (I find that I can make it last longer by diluting the contents with water for showering purposes. Still great cleansing and smell.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hot days, nothing is more refreshing than a cool shower with minty Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is basic (good, I want what&#x27;s inside to work well and the price to be low). The label is actually quite weird. (Other reviewers have commented on the \\&quot;trippy\\&quot; or \\&quot;hippy\\&quot; text. They ain&#x27;t exaggerating.) You&#x27;ll get a kick out of trying to figure out the odd--but nice!--writing on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product. Great smell, affordable, and effective.</li>
    <li> I started using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap when I went organic two years ago. It is a bit pricier than other soaps, but sometimes I like to treat myself. I use it as a shower gel and to make it stretch a bit longer, I mix equal parts soap with water in another bottle and it works just as well because the soap is very concentrated. The peppermint is very minty and refreshing especially when you wake up in the morning and leaves your skin tingly and clean. You can also use this soap to wash dishes, the floor, and clothes. It&#x27;s all natural and does not contain any sodium laurel sulfate, which can dry out the skin and potentially cause even more serious damage. I highly recommend this product. I also like their bar soaps.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower, at the sink, really all over the house and all over my body. It cleans well, tingles delightfully and leaves me smelling great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it to wash my hair, i have fine, oily hair, that needs daily washing.  My hair stays oil free longer with this.  I also use it as a body wash and use it to bathe my kids. they love the peppermint and i love the way it rinses clean from there hair and body.  i use it in my kitchen and it DISSOLVES grease! I mean really disolves it.  I take a bowl, throw some of this stuff in with hot water, sponge with scrubber and go at it.  It really cleaned the vent hood over the stove.  Awesome stuff!!</li>
    <li> You have to be prepared for a different kind of soap when using this product. It doesn&#x27;t lather as good, and while it is mint-scented, it does not leave you with the traditional clean, crisp, sweet mint after-scent. I like the product for its natural content.</li>
    <li> This soap is very good, the aroma is intense and pleasant as others have said and a little goes a long way.  It will however, burn your eyes and other sensitive areas, so be careful if using with small children.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product.  Its one of the best all purpose body cleaning soap.  I recently moved and don&#x27;t have convenient access to a local health food store like I once did.  I think I will be buy this product from this vendor on an ongoing basis. Product came to my house on time and in tack with no spillage.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my skin tingle with freshness! Peppermint is good for the skin. I also use this on my hair, sometimes to wash my laundry and the floors. Who could go wrong with castile?</li>
    <li> Great product, good price. I love this soap!!</li>
    <li> You cannot possibly go wrong with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps. Well, maybe you can. I don&#x27;t recommend that anyone with a decent amount of hair use this product as a shampoo. I thought I would never be able to comb my hair again.  Otherwise, it is awesome.</li>
    <li> not only cleans, but also refreshes; tho care should be used in the eye and genital area&lt;br /&gt;so as to not antagonize the tender mucus tissues.</li>
    <li> I loved the fragrance.  I bought \\&quot;lavender and \\&quot;peppermint\\&quot;, however I found that it dried my skin.  It was fine as long as I directly used moisturizer after washing my hands.</li>
    <li> This soap is very potent, very strong, and refreshing--it makes your skin tingle.  The peppermint is our favorite and is EXCELLENT for hot, tired feet.  Use it in the shower or for soaking just your feet--great after a long day in shoes, playing sports, running, or walking at a mall or theme park.  You can use it full strength on your feet, but even diluted a lot it maintains a potent zing that refreshes.</li>
    <li> Fast accurate very pleased</li>
    <li> My Hunny loves washing with this, says cleans his body, calls it his godly soap. Can wash walls n floors and use it to clean other things and washes the stink away. Used it to clean out our stinky freezer, no more stink.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Peppermint is my favorite. I&#x27;ve got my husband and mother hooked on this soap as well. If you have really hard water like I do, you&#x27;re going to get the soap scum thing going on because this is real soap. I use it as shampoo too. If I don&#x27;t rejuvenate my shower water softener I&#x27;ll need to use more soap than normal and after washing my hair I will need to rinse it with a little water/apple cider vinegar mix. My mother now uses this soap to wash dishes, too.  If my water wasn&#x27;t so hard I would probably use it for dishes as well.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever!  There is a wonderful documentary about the amazing Dr. Browner.  Look it up on Amazon or Netflix.  Try reading the label on the bottle.  This is truly an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I grew up using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap. The formula may be the same but it is a lot thinner then it use to be and lighter in color. When I first started using this product it was a darker tan almost carmel in color and a thicker consistency. However it still preforms as it always has but it doesn&#x27;t last as long. I will continue to use this product and recommend it. I support fare trade.</li>
    <li> I dilute this with water and shower with it..feels soooo clean, but the smell can be a bit much at times. Also helped my acne prone skin significantly</li>
    <li> No further comment needed.</li>
    <li> My sons have sensitive skin and so they use this as body wash and really helps.  It was exactly what I wanted and came quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a nice peppermint soap, it has a very strong smell.  I like it, even when I am done with my shower, the whole bathroom smells like peppermint for a while.  If you do not like strong smells, you can dilute it with water if you like.  You only need a  little to get cleaned.  It lathers up nicely.</li>
    <li> This is the staple at our house for many things - hand washing, it&#x27;s in all the dispensers and I water it down a bit. Nice smell and leaves hands feeling clean without stripping them of oils.  This is also good for body washing - just a dab will go far on a wash cloth.</li>
    <li> Classic, envigorating peppermint soap, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> We love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soaps because they have a great smell, work very well, have no artificial ingredients and they leave no residue.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s when camping and having to bath in creeks, it&#x27;s biodegradable.  This was perhaps 25 years ago and I&#x27;ve since been using it exclusively at home, on the road and when camping.</li>
    <li> I love this it reminds me of back in the 60 &amp; 70s. I will be buying it again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Makes your skin feel wonderful, can use it for all your bathing/cleaning needs. It&#x27;s mild, great for your skin. The peppermint gives a nice, natural tingle.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr Bronners Magic Soap since 1980 and every time I try anything else I am reminded that Bronners is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;* Works on just about anything like your body, your clothes, your teeth (yes it makes a tremendous replacement for all those chemicals in toothpaste) and a lot more&lt;br /&gt;* Cheap, a little goes a LONG ways and way cheaper than anything else per use, 32 OZ lasts us most of a year&lt;br /&gt;* You know what is in this stuff, and it is all stuff you don&#x27;t mind putting in/on your body, no animal testing needed, human animals have been using these ingredients forever&lt;br /&gt;* The new labels don&#x27;t come off and wash down the drain&lt;br /&gt;* Great to take camping in the back country as a little goes a long ways and does not hurt the environment like a lot of products do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;* Really miss the full text of Emmanual&#x27;s holy writ on the bottle, used to read that in the shower to start my day, wish it would come back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the whole story see Dr Bronners Magic Soapbox: [[ASIN:B0014NA52A Dr Bronners Magic Soapbox Bronner]]</li>
    <li> The best thing about using these oils is there are 101 uses!&lt;br /&gt;(google: 100 uses for Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soap)&lt;br /&gt;I personally dilute 4 or 5 parts water to: 1 part soap-in a hand pump FOAM Dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;I dilute it the same 4 or 5 parts water to 1 part soap- for my SHAMPOO&lt;br /&gt;I use Dr. Bronners soap diluted the same 4-5 parts water to 1 part soap for washing&lt;br /&gt;dishes in a sink.&lt;br /&gt;There also is a MILD baby soap if you like UNscented.&lt;br /&gt;But ALWAYS dilute at least 4x what is in this bottle...it goes a looooooong way</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has a great story.  The company is awesome and has a fantastic philosophy.  I use the liquid castile soaps as a body and for home cleaning - diluted in a spray bottle.  It makes me feel closer to &amp;#34;doing right&amp;#34;.  The peppermint is a great wake-me-up</li>
    <li> I like using the castile soap on my body, and as a spreader/sticker for oil in my garden, but as a shampoo??? Awful!  I don&#x27;t even know how to describe how awful my hair felt.  My scalp felt good, but it took a week to get my hair feeling half way healthy again.</li>
    <li> Dr.Bronner&#x27;s peppermint Castile liquid soap has been a standby for me since the 70s. It lasts decades in my case because I also use Woolite and regular laundry soaps for volume washing. But Dr. B &#x27;s is Gentle and safe. These days I use it to wash altar cloths.</li>
    <li> I like the way this soap makes my skin feel. Not dry and fresh and clean and tingly feeling. I really love how it doesn&#x27;t dry out the  skin the best.</li>
    <li> This is not Castile soap. I&#x27;m sure it is nicer than most commercial products out there and maybe even comparable to handcrafted, but I&#x27;m not sure why they are marketing it as pure Castile when it clearly is not. Either the makers are uninformed (!!!) or using unsavory marketing tactics (!!!). Again, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a fine product but read the label if you are looking for pure Castile.</li>
    <li> I spray this on hemlock bushes to prevent and kill mites.  I works great, leaves the yard smelling nice and is MUCH cheaper than insecticidal soap.  You have to dilute it or it will burn the bushes.</li>
    <li> This organic, environmentally friendly soap has been part of my morning routine for years.  There is nothing not to like--the scent will wake you up, its gentle on your skin and you can feel good about using it.</li>
    <li> If you have problems with ants............this will keep them away. Mix some with water in a spray bottle, and spray the area. Ants hate peppermint. Use for general house cleaning.</li>
    <li> Love Dr Bronner soaps.</li>
    <li> This stuff is tremendous! I stumbled on Dr. Bonners years ago, and I&#x27;ll never go back. Love love love the peppermint soap on a hot summer day to cool down. Great product and free of all of the garbage additives that exist in most commercially produced soaps these days.  There is actually a very interesting documentary out there on Dr. Bonner&#x27;s life journey which you should check out if you have some time. A really fascinating man who had a great message that he was spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never tried it, do yourself a favor and pick some up. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP.  I BROUGHT IT FOR MY HUSBAND AND WHEN HE USES IT THE WHOLE BATHROOM SMELLS GOOD AS DOES HE..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, since the early 70&#x27;s. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this soap, and will not go back to popular bar soaps that are sold in stores. I feel so much cleaner using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soap compared to regular soaps.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. I use it to wash my hair and body gives a nice clean tingly feel. I feel very refreshed after it&#x27;s use. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Always a good product, and very easy to obtain through Amazon.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps I submit they are worth a try.  Lather and rinse well.  The peppermint adds a refreshing zing to your shower.  I also like the almond as it reminds me of the old Jergan&#x27;s lotion.</li>
    <li> What else can you say about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  If natural pure soap is your thing, this is what our generation has been using for generations.  Not only is the product great but buy it to read the label.</li>
    <li> Best Castile Soap hands down.  Use it for everything!  I like the 32. oz for the laundry room.  This stuff is amazing.  Peppermint is my favorite because it&#x27;s so versatile.  We use it as laundry soap, hand soap, body wash (tingly though), anything.  Great product and hope I never have to go without it.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap for summertime cool down. I mix it with my favorite body wash because I&#x27;ve always found it to be drying to my skin. When mixed it works great and adds a cooling quality to my skin for about a 1/2 hour after a bath. Refreshing on really hot summer days. Just avoid the sensitive skin areas as it will have a burning sensation, although probably not harmful. I&#x27;ve used this product for 30+ years.</li>
    <li> Dr Bronner&#x27;s is the best Pure-Castile soap on the market and the price is right on Amazon.  Wonderful tingling sensation when applied to the skin.  The Peppermint just explodes when washing with this soap.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this soap and for sure I will keep on buying it for the rest of my life! So many uses for it!!! My favorite use is as a vegetable/fruit wash. It strips them clean! Also my mom is really enjoying it as a body wash. She loves the smells and says it&#x27;s very refreshing. I can&#x27;t wait to try it as shampoo. A must have for everyone!! Only thing is that it is way too expensive here on amazon. I bought mine at Fresh n Easy for $12. I would buy it at Trader Joe&#x27;s for $11 as other people have said but Fresh n Easy is closer to home.</li>
    <li> I really love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap.  It has a wonderful scent that wakes you right up and although the soap itself is very watery, it lathers up great just using little bit.  The peppermint also makes your skin feel amazing.  And the 32 oz bottle is huge!  It will definitely last me close to a year.  The only drawback of the soap is that it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest moisturizing qualities.  I live in New England and the winters get VERY dry.  I wholeheartedly recommend this product for the warmer months but it is not a moisturizing soap by any means.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bonner&#x27;s peppermint soap, have used it for years.  Cheaper to purchase here than at my local health store.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  The refreshing smell gives you a little boost in the morning.  I also use it to refill the foam hand soap dispenser bottles. Just be sure to dilute it first.</li>
    <li> I have been using castile soap for about a year now. I use it for all my bathing needs - shampoo, body wash, shaving cream... it works great. I love that it is natural -nothing synthetic- and it last a long time too. When I dilute it in water, it last about 4 moths.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. My mother used this soap when I was a kid- we used to call it hippie soap. Now some 20+ years later, it&#x27;s still the same and still the best.</li>
    <li> Ive been using Dr Bronners peppermint soap for years, Love this stuff, however last 2 shipments were weak on the peppermint. Used to smell strong and tingle when used, not anymore. Looks like this company has followed suit with corporate america and reduced the main component that made it great to increase the bottom line. Too bad, This WAS a great product.</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this to me for dry skin and it works great! Love the SMELL! A gentle soap with no harsh chems. If you have dry skin, you should TRY IT!</li>
    <li> Put in the laundry and love the smell!</li>
    <li> Extremely Concentrated!!!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves you clean but moisturized unlike most soaps that dry out your skin in the process. Found this at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $11 for the 32 fl. oz.bottle.</li>
    <li> cool and refreshing while I shower. smell great too. I give this as a gift also and the person loves it</li>
    <li> Consistently Dr Bronner! I&#x27;ve used it for decades. Wash all veggies and fruits with it.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews I was excited to get this soap and tried it out as soon as I got it in the mail.  Needless to say I was deeply disappointed with this product, more so than I could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very liquidy and watery which was a surprise to me.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be thick and as creamy as what I normally use, but it was hard to tell the difference between this and water.  Consistency though was not so much a concern as when I washed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the smell was a bit strange, but then I realized that it smelled chemically and the closest thing I could equate it to was not peppermint but rather far more like vomit.  My hope at that point was to wash it off as soon as I got a lather.  I used this in my beard and my hair initially, and once rinsed out the texture left in my hair and beard was like i had just poured sticky machine oil residue to the touch in my hair.  I then grabbed my regular soap and had to wash out the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the day my skin has even felt warm almost burnt like its been chemically burned from just a minute of having the soap on the skin, and even though I used other soap to wash it out the faint smell of it is lingering throughout the day.  Now I can&#x27;t wait to get home to scrub my hair and beard again to try to get that smell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit this is probably the worst shopping experience I have had with a product so far especially since i was excited to use it.  I bought 2 32 ounce bottles based on hope and they are both going in the trash.  I can only assume others must have a different expectation from this product or are used to natural soaps, or the product received was just different.  I wanted to make sure to post my experience though so others can see it.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding? This soap is amazing. I have been  using it since college. In the summer when it is hot, there is nothing better than a shower with Dr. Bronners. When you have been doing work in the garden, garage this soap is fantastic  in the shower or as hand soap. We use it year round next to the sink for hand washing and tough dishes. We use it in the shower in the hot months because it is so refreshing. Although the bottle says you can brush your teeth with it, dont. I tried it, it was disgusting. Other than that, I love this soap and wish regular supermarkets would stock it.</li>
    <li> A friend uses this and gave me a chance to also try it out. I love that it is naturally made from herbs. I also drop a few in my laundry</li>
    <li> I used a pea sized amount on my face, worked into a nice lather (avoiding my eyes), gently scrubbed with a soft wash cloth and rinsed.  Wow!  Is my face soft and clean!  I honestly don&#x27;t think my face has been this soft since I was born...okay, I may be exagerating a little, but just a little.  And, the smell is heavenly!  I am a huge peppermint fan and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the aroma.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I love this soap, it was a good price and delivery was quick.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years and would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Great product, quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Cleans and smells better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Strong peppermint concentration is great if you happen to love its scent and clean feeling. It&#x27;s great for the whole body except right on your wee-wee and eyeballs (I use it around and the wash-off is quick and diluted enough to wash the more sensitive areas I don&#x27;t put soap on. You may want to use soap without peppermint for the sensitive areas). The label spiritual-wannabe rant doesn&#x27;t seem to make any sense, but who cares, I just love the soap and use it undiluted in a foam spray, don&#x27;t even see the label. I don&#x27;t know of any better, more pure soap. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This soap is literally all purpose. You can use it to clean and make your home smell minty. Or you can use it in the shower and leave your skin feeling amazing.</li>
    <li> I like this natural and great smelling soap. It&#x27; versatile , can be used for many differnt things. Unfortunately, I found the same soap, same size for a much lower prize at Trader Joe&#x27;s, this one was overprized.</li>
    <li> Dr. Browner&#x27;s is awesome!  So many uses.  I also have the lavender scent. I got the peppermint to clean with.  Bugs do not like peppermint!</li>
    <li> I used this product everyday and I appreciated the quick service since I almost ran out.  Great for cleaning face, don&#x27;t get in eyes.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap, except that if you use it for entire shower, it is hard to keep from getting in your eyes. Unlike regular soap, it seeps into and diminishes the permeable barrier and easily seeps into your eyes. So just be aware of that, and be very conscious of that, and you may find yourself squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> As with all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products, this is an excellent one and I use it for many different purposed.  I used to take this camping as I knew it would not harm the environment.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this soap with cold pressed neem oil to fight insects in the garden.  The combination got rid of whitefly on citrus where other organic remedies had failed.</li>
    <li> Sent this to Afghanistan and it was most appreciated because its so soothing</li>
    <li> One of the finest castile soaps out there.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for over 40 years.  Only three drops needed to wash your hands, five for face including ears and neck.  And it is simply the best for your skin.  Seems expensive, but if you use only what is actually needed it costs less than other liquid soaps, and don&#x27;t even get me started on stupid bar soap!</li>
    <li> Only product I use in the shower! Love this stuff for camping too!</li>
    <li> Great, fragrant product. I use this soap diluted to clean everything from my microwave to myself. I think it&#x27;s actually helping my keratosis pilaris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This product also works really great for removing soap scum and hard water build up from my shower. It leaves a weird white buildup if you don&#x27;t scrub it all off after though. I use an old, used up scouring pad from the kitchen in my shower, spray the diluted soap on, and then scrub as I rinse it off with my shower head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I bought this in peppermint scent to scare off the mice in my building. It seemed to work, but the peppermint smell wears off, so you have to scrub your floors again. Instead,  I used a peppermint essential oil, soaked some cottonballs in it, and stuck them wherever the mouse came into our apartment through the heating pipes. Seems to have deterred the mouse from hanging around too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the keratosis? VERY HELPFUL. My keratosis flares up in summers and this soap is gentle enough to dry them out without messing up my skin. I am AMAZED. My keratosis isn&#x27;t that bad and it&#x27;s not the hard, bumpy kind. They&#x27;re the softer kind, which makes exfoliating key and moisturizing an important but secondary concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this soap and how natural and gentle it is on everything. Instantly dissolves oily stains and scours everything off without making you feel dizzy from the fumes. Almond is my new favorite scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products for many years now and they&#x27;re fantastic. I use the peppermint soap to wash my body. The scent is pleasant and just a few drops lathers up beautifully. I find the 32-ounce size lasts about three months and that&#x27;s with twice daily use. This product works great, is fairly priced, is organic, and won&#x27;t harm our fragile environment. You just can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Old school quality item. Very few ingredients &amp; all are good for u &amp; your skin;)&lt;br /&gt;I use it for dishwasher&#x3D;the best! Hand-washing is fine,dilute it twice and its not gonna dry your skin as pure one does.&lt;br /&gt;Forget all your eczema&#x27;s &amp; other skin probs, if u change your chemical soaps for this one.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all, folks;)</li>
    <li> My mom loved this stuff, but I think it makes my skin really itchy for about fifteen minutes after using it. I bought this for my mom, but realized only after I could get it a few dollars cheaper at longs drugstore on sale... So before you buy two large bottles for $30, make sure you check your local store prices.</li>
    <li> harsh on the skin after using almost every day</li>
    <li> BEST SOAP IN THE WORLD</li>
    <li> love it, will continue to purchase, it smells so great.</li>
    <li> This soap has so many uses, though prefer to use it in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with a sticky film and invigorates me, very refreshing.</li>
    <li> As a personal taste... the peppermint soap may not be to everyone&#x27;s liking.  A bit overpowering unless you really like the fresh clean sent of peppermint....  My wife loves it.  As a soap I love it, a very good product that cleans better than most toxic commercial soap products and  the peppermint aroma  is all natural and not chemical concoction like most nasty orange scented cleaners.  Since it is concentrated I mix it with a good green soap.  Pure castle soaps are a product well worth trying with or without the peppermint.</li>
    <li> This minty soap makes my morning shower delightful! It&#x27;s great for my skin and leaves me feeling super refreshed and invigorated.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap delivered right to my door! Nothing beats bathing with tingling Castille Peppermint soap on a hot summer day! I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 40 years, but it is difficult to find locally. So glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this soap for my dogs. They get so clean but their coat still remains healthy and they smell great days later. It is also useful to clean my parrot&#x27;s cage from the poo and grime they love to create.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE PEPPERMINT.  USE IT EVERY DAY TO WASH MY SKIN.  IF YOU REALLY LOVE PEPPERMINT YOU WILL LOVE IT.  IT IS STRONG SCENT.  CAN&#x27;T SHOWER WITHOUT IT!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this product.  I now use this soap, baking soda, and vinegar alone to clean my entire house.  My house is sparkling clean, and finally cleaning no longer makes me feel sick.  I buy a huge bag of baking soda from Costco for $3 as well as four gallons of vinegar for $4.  Cheap, extremely effective, and no need to worry about toxicity.  I can&#x27;t believe I ever bought into the idea that I needed toxic expensive cleaning products.  Another big one was the discovery of real steel wool instead of SOS pads that disintegrate in a few days.  Real steel wool will last forever.</li>
    <li> My family has been using Dr Bronners soap since I was a kid (I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now).I stumbled upon this soap again while in NYC on business and I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I bought the last three 16oz bottles on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell you there&#x27;s NOTHING like Dr. Bonners soap and a loofa. The only thing I can liken it to is, you know the cool feeling in your mouth when your eating a York Peppermint Patty? Imagine that feeling over your entire body!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s Dr. Bonners in a nutshell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes along way, I swear the stuff is concentrated. You can easily cut this in half and double your product. I love when someone who doesn&#x27;t know about Dr Bonner is in my home when I&#x27;m showering. I get all kinds of comments from, &amp;#34;is that a candle&amp;#34; , &amp;#34;are you showering with peppermints&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;did you spill Vicks&amp;#34;? I love it.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years, and years.... great for oily skin. Love the peppermint smell. I dilute it, maybe 60% soap to 40% water - otherwise it plugs up the opening.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. Dropped a star because it seems like lately it is a bit watered down. May be my imagination.  I haven&#x27;t found any other product that comes close to the refreshing effectiveness of this one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as many other&#x27;s claim that they do, I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant amount of &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; on the tub since using this product (probably the same issue as why they say you cannot use it in a pump, it gums up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently using it with a body luffa, I usually start with my hair for a &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; or else I just feel like the luffa is just not doing anything but exfoliating, not as much &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; due to the lack of soapy-ness.  (I understand that this is a claim of the soap), but unless you use a decent quantity of it, there really is a degraded quality in the performance the further you get away from the point of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corey</li>
    <li> My wife and I LOVE this soap.  We put it in a foaming dispenser and it lasts forever.  We use this for laundry, washing hands, in the shower and for many other uses.  Smells great and  feels great.</li>
    <li> I love the peppermint but was sent 1 bottle of almond instead of the two peppermint I ordered  I am very disappointed</li>
    <li> I discovered this soap 20 years ago in a discount store in New York. It is the best soap ever &amp; the company founder&#x27;s philosophy is interesting reading in the shower/bath too. If you workout, use this soap after and it will revitalize you. I guarantee that you will feel like you are ready to go back for more excercise. I&#x27;ve introduced it to my entire family &amp; friends network. They all rave about it too!</li>
    <li> Great product but found significantly  cheaper at Trader Joe&#x27;s</li>
    <li> The best soap hands down</li>
    <li> Have used many times with complete satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Favorite product for many years.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this soap to me and I recieved my first bottle 3 days ago.  I have only used it as a body wash and shampoo so far but am very happy with it.  It rinses clean quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any residue afterwards.  It is a pleasure to  wash with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent multipurpose soap. Have always taken it camping and advise everyone to get some.</li>
    <li> used this soap for years and liked it ran out so this replaces the old one</li>
    <li> wash everything with it, except your eyes.</li>
    <li> great product.  I have ben buying for 10+ years!</li>
    <li> I have used this to replace all of my shower products and it performs better than any of them. I use this to clean my hair, body, and to shave with. It leaves you feeling very clean, and a little tingly from the peppermint. The aromas make me very relaxed. I like the fact that its made from natural products and that I&#x27;m not supporting &amp;#34;big soap&amp;#34;. I can also get lost and spend too much time in the shower reading the label with its interesting but somewhat nonsensical philosophical inscriptions.</li>
