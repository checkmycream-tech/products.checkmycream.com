      <li>, i even did my nail outside of my house, and put the table and light in back yard to do the nail.</li>
      <li>They contacted me and asked if okay to send same thing in 2 small bottles instead of 1 large.</li>
      <li>a professional</li>
      <li>it will go far</li>
      <li>or you do this professionally</li>
      <li>Very small but love it.</li>
      <li>I will be going to school soon for Nail Technology but cannot currently purchase professional products.</li>
      <li>Worked well with the powder to create false nails :)</li>
      <li>This was a bit of a problem for me as a beginner, so I&#x27;m not sure I will buy this again as I need a slower set to build the right structure for myself.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve found my new go to acrylic liquid.</li>

<li> The smell is different and the color is bluish instead of clear (probably due to environmental laws over the years), but it still works with the powders from both now and powder saved from way back when it was purchased from Ball Beauty Supply on Fairfax in Los Angeles.</li>
<li> Expected this to be a bit bigger</li>
<li> Not sure if this is the same company that I used some 35 years ago.</li>
<li> The liquid has an odor, but with windows open and fans going it was cleared out of my small apartment less than an hour after I was done.</li>
<li> no lifting my only complaint is the smell</li>
<li> Its just to small of a bottle</li>
<li> I was going to try using this with the acrylic powder in a craft, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell of it.  </li>
<li> Seriously of your gonna do this</li>
<li> This made me look bad.</li>

    <li> Was just as described.  Packaged very well. No spillage at all! Product was great for what I needed it for. Great price and fast shipping. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This has lasted me quite some time, was exactly as described and arrived on time, thank you!</li>
    <li> good value for this!! work well for me.</li>
    <li> its the power not the liquid. they really need to change the picture</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, love it. already received right on time thanks.</li>
    <li> I used this product with the super nail powder. im a professional and i regret it! I used it on three clients and their nails just popped off within a day or two. This made me look bad. I do not recommend for professionals at all. And its not cheap i could have bought real acrylic.</li>
    <li> Worked well with the powder to create false nails :)</li>
    <li> Just like the one they use in the salon. Smell isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
    <li> Soo.. whoever said this didn&#x27;t smell strong was lying! Seriously of your gonna do this I advise to do it outside or something cuz the strong is so strong it lingered all night and gave me a headache I foolishly did it in my apartment but next time I think I&#x27;ll do it outside on the deck. Other than that it&#x27;s great it worked well no lifting my only complaint is the smell</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Recommended seller.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product! I like to give it a thumbs up! I definitely will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> The smell is not that of what you smell when you walk by a salon or nail store. It has such a low smell you almost don&#x27;t even smell it.</li>
    <li> This product is really good it&#x27;s a nice amount for the price I&#x27;ve done nails about 5 times with this and still have a lot left as long as your not waist full it will go far</li>
    <li> I will be going to school soon for Nail Technology but cannot currently purchase professional products. Supernail works well for me doing my own nails at home.

    <li> My daughter likes that is what counts. They contacted me and asked if okay to send same thing in 2 small bottles instead of 1 large. I&#x27;m glad they where nice and called.</li>
    <li> Oh, the odor is horrendous!  I was going to try using this with the acrylic powder in a craft, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell of it.  The product may be a great one, but the smell is intolerable to me.</li>
    <li> shipped was so fast, but it is so and too strong smell, i even did my nail outside of my house, and put the table and light in back yard to do the nail.</li>
