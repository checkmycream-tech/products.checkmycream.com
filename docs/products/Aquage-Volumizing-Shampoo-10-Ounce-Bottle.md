### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am usually very happy with Aquage products, but i have to admit i am not a fan of this shampoo because of the smell.</li>
      <li>Great Shampoo!</li>
      <li>This is the best in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>I am impressed with this shampoo!</li>
      <li>The best part, however, is the fact that it does all this for me AND doesn&#x27;t fade out</li>
      <li>this really is great for your hair</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>The best volumizing shampoo I&#x27;ve tried - and I love all the Aquage line.</li>
      <li>I have used Aquage shampoo from salons and loved it.</li>
      <li>The volumizing lathers well, smells good, and does leave volume in your hair.  </li>
      <li>Love Aquage products!</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>Love the way my hair looks.</li>
      <li>I love aquage volumizing Shampoo, I have used this producted for sometime.</li>
      <li>I just discovered this line of hair care and fell in love with the Aquage Root Lift spray, so I decided to go ahead and try the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>but I have been so impressed with the shampoo and conditioner that whenever my current supply of anything else runs out</li>
      <li>I used more of it than I thought I would have had to because it was so watery.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get my hair feeling clean!</li>
      <li>My hair is a fine texture and it works well for it</li>
      <li>I can use this every time I wash my hair and my hair feels light and clean afterward, and it remains easy to style.</li>
      <li>This shampoo works fantastic for my hair type (colored and frizzy).  </li>
      <li>They are lightly scented so</li>
      <li>Probably a cheap grocery store shampoo.</li>
      <li>it does not volumize as well as others I have tried and it doesn&#x27;t clean as well either.  </li>
      <li>After reading all the good reviews I was instantly sold on it, but after using, not at all.</li>
      <li>I had to wash it more frequently.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is very moisturizing, so if you have flat or greasy hair this product may not be good for your hair type.</li>
      <li>Price is right too.</li>
      <li>works great on fine thin color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>I have color-treated, fine hair, so I&#x27;m always looking for products that not only clean my hair but moisturize and add volume.</li>
      <li>First of all, these came wrapped in homemade baggies and some of the product had leaked out, which I did not expect from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I bought my last bottle of shampoo on Amazon because the salon I go to was sold out, and it is a better deal than the store price</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo through my salon, was satisfied with it, and ordered my next bottle from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>ago, having tried MANY different brands including Pureology.  </li>
      <li>It was an Aquage bottle that had clearly been filled with another product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but if you are going to claim your product does certain things, then they should hold up that.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money because it helps to keep your haircolor from fading too quick; as well as give your hair lots of volume and shine.</li>
      <li>This shampoo adds nothing, it takes so much to even make any lather.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I took my hair colorist&#x27;s advice and tried out the Aquage line, and it&#x27;s definitely made a return customer out of me!</li>
      <li>Then when I poured it into my hand it was very watery.</li>
      <li>, it does not bother my allergies like most other hair products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>A little volume would be better than this one claims to provide.  </li>
      <li>I also feel like it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair looking/smelling clean for very long.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo made my hair shiny, and when I tried another brand, I could tell the difference and went right back to Aquage.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft, flexible,  and I get my hair colored and highlighted every 5-6 wks.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s definitely a noticeable difference: my mom asked me if I was using a new shampoo!</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair and you can use daily and makes it feel soft</li>
      <li>This shampoo was recommended to me by my hair colorist after I complained to her that the reason I never use \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; shampoos is because my hair never feels clean.</li>
      <li>I could use Herbal Essences regularly, at the cost of fading out my hair color (sadly, even \\&quot;color protecting\\&quot; grocery store products are not as effective as those found in a salon).</li>
      <li>I had tried Redken, Paul Mitchell, you name it, and they would work for the first week or so and then after that my hair would be left feeling heavy and flat.</li>

<li> This shampoo does volumize well and it lathers nicely, but the smell is unpleasant.  </li>
<li> I am SO disappointed, and wondering if I got a product that was tampered with after all the other great reviews I have read.</li>
<li> I have not tried other Aquage products</li>
<li> it is definitely not worth the price</li>
<li> It seemed watered down</li>
<li> They truly give volume to your hair without weighing it down.  </li>
<li> and I wonder if its been watered down?  </li>
<li> It acts like watered down conditioner rather than shampoo.  </li>
<li> This bottle may have been a bad lot, but sadly the shampoo is much thinner in consistency, and leaves my hair too soft and very limp (the opposite of the salon bottles).  </li>
<li> It is one of the few shampoos that does not fade color-treated hair.  </li>
<li> I will use it because I don&#x27;t want to waste the money.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what to do.</li>
<li> I wondered if the conditioner would help, but it only made it worse!</li>
<li> Expensive, but lasts a long time.</li>
<li> this shampoo is as thin as broth.  </li>
<li> It was a lot of money for a horrible product that I had high hopes for and my hair has never felt worse after a washing!</li>
<li> and I do know manufactors do make mistakes, sorry</li>
<li> Hugely disappointing.</li>
<li> However, this bottle may have come from the manufactor as a bad lot.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.</li>
<li> Even after scrubbing my scalp until it was sore, my hair was all knotted and horribly brittle feeling!</li>
<li> the worst shampoo I have ever used</li>

    <li> it  doesn&#x27;t produce much foam, my hair is heavy and sticky , looks like I didn&#x27;t wash it, the worst shampoo I have ever used</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended to me by my hair colorist after I complained to her that the reason I never use \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; shampoos is because my hair never feels clean. I have very fine hair but a lot of it, and I color it regularly. I had tried Redken, Paul Mitchell, you name it, and they would work for the first week or so and then after that my hair would be left feeling heavy and flat. I had been using grocery store shampoo brands because I know I could use Herbal Essences regularly, at the cost of fading out my hair color (sadly, even \\&quot;color protecting\\&quot; grocery store products are not as effective as those found in a salon). Fortunately, I took my hair colorist&#x27;s advice and tried out the Aquage line, and it&#x27;s definitely made a return customer out of me! I can use this every time I wash my hair and my hair feels light and clean afterward, and it remains easy to style. There&#x27;s definitely a noticeable difference: my mom asked me if I was using a new shampoo! The best part, however, is the fact that it does all this for me AND doesn&#x27;t fade out my color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the volumizing conditioner as well but am thinking about changing to a moisturizing one. I bought my last bottle of shampoo on Amazon because the salon I go to was sold out, and it is a better deal than the store price so I will continue to purchase it here. I have not tried other Aquage products but I have been so impressed with the shampoo and conditioner that whenever my current supply of anything else runs out I&#x27;ll give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I have used Aquage shampoo from salons and loved it. What I received was NOT Aquage shampoo. It was an Aquage bottle that had clearly been filled with another product. Probably a cheap grocery store shampoo. What I received did not feel, look, or smell at all like Aquage. Hugely disappointing.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this shampoo.  It&#x27;s worth the extra money because it helps to keep your haircolor from fading too quick; as well as give your hair lots of volume and shine.</li>
    <li> are you kidding?  for this price....this shampoo is as thin as broth.  it is definitely not worth the price and I wonder if its been watered down?  I will use it because I don&#x27;t want to waste the money.  it does not volumize as well as others I have tried and it doesn&#x27;t clean as well either.  I will not purchase this product from this site again.  I am going to compare it to the one my hairdresser uses.  I know hers is thicker!</li>
    <li> I love aquage volumizing Shampoo, I have used this producted for sometime. However, this bottle may have come from the manufactor as a bad lot. It seemed watered down and I do know manufactors do make mistakes, sorry</li>
    <li> This shampoo does volumize well and it lathers nicely, but the smell is unpleasant.  It smells like kitchen cleanser.  I also feel like it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair looking/smelling clean for very long.  I had to wash it more frequently.</li>
    <li> I am usually very happy with Aquage products, but i have to admit i am not a fan of this shampoo because of the smell.</li>

After reading all the good reviews I was instantly sold on it, but after using, not at all.</li>
    <li> I like the Aquage shampoo I rated this a 5 however that is not what I received. I have not tried the shampoo that was shipped.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo through my salon, was satisfied with it, and ordered my next bottle from Amazon.  This bottle may have been a bad lot, but sadly the shampoo is much thinner in consistency, and leaves my hair too soft and very limp (the opposite of the salon bottles).  It acts like watered down conditioner rather than shampoo.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Received on time and met my expectations.  Have used this product for years and can&#x27;t use anything else.  My hair is a fine texture and it works well for it</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the way my hair looks.</li>
    <li> this really is great for your hair it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair and you can use daily and makes it feel soft</li>
    <li> In three weeks I have seen an improvement in the managability, feel and appearance of my hair. I am impressed with this shampoo!</li>
    <li> works great on fine thin color treated hair.  Price is right too.</li>
    <li> Love Aquage products! They truly give volume to your hair without weighing it down.  They are lightly scented so, it does not bother my allergies like most other hair products.</li>
    <li> I just discovered this line of hair care and fell in love with the Aquage Root Lift spray, so I decided to go ahead and try the shampoo and conditioner. I have color-treated, fine hair, so I&#x27;m always looking for products that not only clean my hair but moisturize and add volume. First of all, these came wrapped in homemade baggies and some of the product had leaked out, which I did not expect from Amazon. The bottles were not sealed. Then when I poured it into my hand it was very watery. (hmm). I used more of it than I thought I would have had to because it was so watery. I couldn&#x27;t get my hair feeling clean! Even after scrubbing my scalp until it was sore, my hair was all knotted and horribly brittle feeling! I wondered if the conditioner would help, but it only made it worse! I am SO disappointed, and wondering if I got a product that was tampered with after all the other great reviews I have read. I&#x27;m not sure what to do. It was a lot of money for a horrible product that I had high hopes for and my hair has never felt worse after a washing!</li>
    <li> Got hooked on Aquage about 6 yrs. ago, having tried MANY different brands including Pureology.  This is the best in my opinion.  Leaves hair soft, flexible,  and I get my hair colored and highlighted every 5-6 wks.  The volumizing lathers well, smells good, and does leave volume in your hair.  I will also get the volumizing conditioner next time to use with it. Expensive, but lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works fantastic for my hair type (colored and frizzy).  The shampoo made my hair shiny, and when I tried another brand, I could tell the difference and went right back to Aquage.  It is one of the few shampoos that does not fade color-treated hair.  A lot of shampoos say they do not fade color-treated hair, but do anyways.  The shampoo is very moisturizing, so if you have flat or greasy hair this product may not be good for your hair type.</li>
    <li> The best volumizing shampoo I&#x27;ve tried - and I love all the Aquage line.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo! My hairdresser recommended it and it works.</li>
