      <li>not too happy with it.</li>

      <li>even my own mother loved it!  </li>
      <li>and when I have fun colors I always go to them!!!!</li>

      <li>Best brand for fun colors.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Manic Panic I love and continue to use!</li>
      <li>Love manic panic hair dye!</li>
      <li>When I wash it out it is a very vibrant purple and it looks awesome.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it is a great, cheap toner.</li>
      <li>Great product, worked perfectly when mixed with conditioner to add a lavender tint.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own anyway).</li>
      <li>so that wasn&#x27;t nice...</li>
      <li>It looked nice, but bled everywhere and washed out after one wash.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect, i really recommend it</li>
      <li>The longest she lasted without re dying her hair was a month and by that time her color had faded to a nice lavender color.</li>
      <li>With semi-permanent products the pigment washes off very easily and gets EVERYWHERE.</li>
      <li>Its great dye, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t stain towels/bath tub, and when your dying your hair and get some dye on your skin it wipes off easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really strong!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great dye if your willing to keep up with it.</li>
      <li>The color was vibrant and beautiful.</li>
      <li>and also that your hair needs to be a very light bleach blond or platinum blond beforehand for you to be able to achieve any cotton candy color.ou to be able to achieve any cotton candy color.</li>
      <li>And i love this purple..</li>
      <li>Then I twist up into a bun on top of my head and let it sit while I shave and all that.</li>
      <li>The longer the better because it is like a conditioning mask</li>
      <li>my favorite.</li>
      <li>My daughter in in love this product,  she used Manic Panic&#x27;s ultra Violet for about 4 months.</li>
      <li>The more you was you hair, the more it will fade.</li>
      <li>in mind the dye will appear more pigmented in the container than it will turn out on your hair.</li>
      <li>Color held very well and looks great.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I recommend leaving it in for a couple of hours to get a more darker look.</li>
      <li>IN LOVE with Manic Panic.</li>
      <li>) Style and go :)</li>
      <li>I love the colors.</li>
      <li>I love this brand because all colors are also vegan and leave your hair feeling better than it did before use.you can also keep it on for hours upon hours when coloring hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>But we found that the Manic Panic &amp;#34;Amplified&amp;#34; works better.</li>
      <li>so the purple really popped and was a great color.</li>
      <li>This has always been my favorite color by manic panic.</li>
      <li>both my daughter and I are completely satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I thought I might be able to get some what of a purple tint</li>
      <li>Have had much better results with another brand.</li>
      <li>I love that I can redye what has faded as many times as I want without damaging my hair.</li>
      <li>Love Manic Panic and this color is to &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34; for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was perfect: It made the streaks deep purple, and the non-bleached hair just looked jet-black, which is what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I would suggest getting 2 jars, or if you want it to be more pastel from the get</li>
      <li>Color held very well and looks great.  </li>
      <li>I love the Manic Panic products; Vegan, no chemicals, not tested on animals and it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like a heating pad for your hair :)</li>
      <li>Nice, gorgeous color.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely suggest if you&#x27;re looking for a vibrant colour,</li>
      <li>The main reason I went for this product was the great reviews I had seen on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>My bangs were a fushia color and my tips looked like a bright purple when i first dyed it</li>
      <li>For best results, use Manic Panic Flash Lightning to bleach out your hair, then dry it, and then apply the color.  </li>
      <li>I get the most fabulous color, just what I wanted</li>
      <li>My daughter would re apply her color every two weeks because she liked the fresh color look.</li>
      <li>If you are looking to dye your hair purple, I would try to find a deeper more pigmented purple because it&#x27;s going to fade to a light purple eventually anyway, and that way you aren&#x27;t spending tons of money on this having to reapply it every week, particularly if you are dying a good amount of your hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it works great just as nice as on loose hair</li>
      <li>and I was excited to have my hair that way as I had never dyed my hair an exotic color.  </li>
      <li>I really loved the vibrant color..</li>
      <li>I have white hair from bleaching and the dye is amazing because its beautiful dark and fades into an absolutely beautiful pastel purple.</li>
      <li>I have used this jar of dye for this purpose for 6 months now, twice a week, and it&#x27;s still more than halfway full.</li>
      <li>Got it really quick!</li>
      <li>We used this in my daughter&#x27;s light brown hair to dye the tips (about the last 2&amp;#34; of her hair) and it came out looking great once it was done.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this for people with light hair.</li>
      <li>Its a temporary color that doesn&#x27;t harm my hair, its all natural, and vegan so its a product I can feel good about using.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you stain a porcelin sink with the color, put more of the color on the stain and it will wash right off.  </li>
      <li>This product is easy to use, with no bad smell, and is not damaging to hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used it on unbleached dark hair and it was only visible for 4-6 days... with the help of sunlight :)</li>
    <li> Used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and was disappointed with the staying power of this dye. The color washed our after two shampoos. Ah well...</li>
    <li> Works well. I loved how it looked. Obviously it will wash out a bit after a few washes. I washing with cold water will definatly help it last longer. Warm water will open the cuticles and take it right out. The color was vibrant and beautiful. I bought this and atomic turquoise I believe and they&#x27;re both great.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted to go purple but she didn&#x27;t want a permanent color and she was afraid that her hair was going to be damage. She goes to beauty school and her teacher recommended her to use Manic Panic do to the fact that its a Semi-Permanent color and it will wash out. My daughter asked me to get it for her due to the information given by her teacher so I did, and both my daughter and I are completely satisfied with this product. Manic Panic is true to color, the color you see is the color you get. They are also conditioned, so after decolorizing your hair and applying the product to your hair, it will feel healthy and soft. My daughter in in love this product,  she used Manic Panic&#x27;s ultra Violet for about 4 months. If you are going to dye your hair with any of the colors you should know that it is an up keep just like any non permanent color. The more you was you hair, the more it will fade. My daughter would re apply her color every two weeks because she liked the fresh color look. The longest she lasted without re dying her hair was a month and by that time her color had faded to a nice lavender color. So If you lighten your hair well when you decolorize and then use any color from Manic Panic and last a long time without washing and don&#x27;t mind having nice pastel color if not re applying product every two weeks then this product is perfect for you. But is you aren&#x27;t ready for the up keep then I don&#x27;t recommend this product for you. If that&#x27;s the problem then you should find a permanent color. With all this said, I will recommend Manic Panic 4oz Semi-Permanent Ultra Violet Hair Dye Purple to each and every one of you crazy outstanding color hair junkies. natharty</li>
    <li> I love manic panic so much and when I have fun colors I always go to them!!!! Best brand for fun colors. :) odorless and long lasting for a temp color. I love this brand because all colors are also vegan and leave your hair feeling better than it did before use.you can also keep it on for hours upon hours when coloring hair.</li>
    <li> I dyed my bangs and tips this color, and i bleached my hair first(my hair is dark brown). Its great dye, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t stain towels/bath tub, and when your dying your hair and get some dye on your skin it wipes off easily. But the color only lasts until I wash my hair. I wash my hair with redken color extend shampoo + conditioner but the color fades. My bangs were a fushia color and my tips looked like a bright purple when i first dyed it and I loved it. I didn&#x27;t shower for about 3 or 4 days and when I did it looked horrible. By my roots the yellow was showing and my hair looked grey when I went out and my tips looked blue. I ended up dying my hair every time I showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair very short and bleached it out platinum blonde. I was trying to figure out a way to grow out the blonde as I grew out my hair without having to keep bleaching it. This product became my perfect solution. Its a temporary color that doesn&#x27;t harm my hair, its all natural, and vegan so its a product I can feel good about using.&lt;br /&gt;I mix the product with a white colored conditioner and v&#x27;oila, instant lavender grey hair. It blends in nicely with my darker roots and since its a temporary color it washes out in a few shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;If I used it full strength and didn&#x27;t dilute, I would end up with VERY VIOLET colored hair, but their products can be diluted to add a subtle hue.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m IN LOVE with Manic Panic. These colors actually leave my hair feeling in better condition than before I used it and since its got no chemicals in it, I can use it as often or as little as I like without having to worry about ending up bald in a few months from over processing.</li>
    <li> Washes out in just a few washes, not semi-permanent at all.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair purple for about a month. This is the best purple I&#x27;ve ever used. It looks purple in yellow light and blue in lights that I don&#x27;t know the name of. It looked blue in my refrigerator light and classroom lights. I recommend using L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Sulfate-free color care system as it did not fade my hair! It stayed a bright purple for over a week before it started to become dull.   This doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it feels like children&#x27;s finger paint. It does stain so be careful not to spill or drip any on any surface. I am definitely going to dye my hair purple again.</li>
    <li> I used this purple while I was dying my hair rainbow colors, and I will post a picture of how it looks (don&#x27;t confuse it with the blue right next to it) In general I think Manic Panic is a little overpriced for how little you get, and how quickly it washes out, but, it&#x27;s not terrible, I still use it along with other brands. This particular color, ultra violet, comes out as a pretty light purple,  unfortunately, the lighter the color- the faster it fades.  If you are looking to dye your hair purple, I would try to find a deeper more pigmented purple because it&#x27;s going to fade to a light purple eventually anyway, and that way you aren&#x27;t spending tons of money on this having to reapply it every week, particularly if you are dying a good amount of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, if you are looking to tone your hair WHITE, from a bleach blonde, THIS is the dye to use!  You get this dye, and any cheap white conditioner, and mix a small amount of this dye into a small bowl of the conditioner so it is a light purple color and apply it to your hair like you would a regular hair dye.  It can tone out the brassiness quite well as long as you find the right balance of conditioner and dye,  it&#x27;s a MUCH cheaper way to tone your hair since you can stretch the dye out so much by mixing it with the conditioner and it works better than say, manic panic&#x27;s toner \\&quot;virgin snow\\&quot; (which really doesn&#x27;t have enough purple pigment on it&#x27;s own anyway). Keep in mind your hair needs to be a super light bleach blonde first if you ever want to achieve white hair with ANY toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the same lines, if you are looking to dye your hair a Cotton Candy Purple, then you simply need to mix a small amount of white conditioner with this purple dye, and it will be the perfect cotton candy purple.&lt;br /&gt;keep in mind the dye will appear more pigmented in the container than it will turn out on your hair. and also that your hair needs to be a very light bleach blond or platinum blond beforehand for you to be able to achieve any cotton candy color.ou to be able to achieve any cotton candy color.</li>
    <li> Purple to the extreme. I leave mine in until my hair dries, and only wash my hair about every 3 days so that it will last longer.</li>
    <li> I have a base color that is dark brown (I am completely gray).  I have my stylist color my base then I put this color on and leave it on for 3 hours.  I get the most fabulous color, just what I wanted (after doing this look in a mirror in the sun, it&#x27;s totally beautiful).  What I like about this product is that it isn&#x27;t messy and doesn&#x27;t color my towels or pillow if I rinse it very, very well then shampoo.  I rinse it out in my stainless steel sink because it doesn&#x27;t stain the SS.  If you stain a porcelin sink with the color, put more of the color on the stain and it will wash right off.  If you want dark hair with a total purple tinge (beautiful), this is the product to use.</li>
    <li> I did not like this color at all. It looked vibrant in the pictures that other&#x27;s posted, but it just did not work for me. It looked really pastel and with the name of this being &amp;#34;Ultra Violet&amp;#34; I did not expect that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect, i really recommend it</li>
    <li> I have used other Manic Panic colors and loved them. For some reason, this color washes out after 1-2 uses. I have no idea why especially since it is a darker color. It just doesn&#x27;t want to stick. So if you are okay with good looking color but not long lasting, this is for you otherwise find a different color.</li>
    <li> Manic Panic is a long time favorite. I have used this product quite a bit. It is awesome also that it is vegan, not tested on animals, and not as harsh on the hair as many other colors are. Manic Panic has proven to work for me time after time. My hair is a crazy bleach addict (I have bleached A LOT) and even as damaged as it gets Manic Panic nails the color:) !!! The colors are vibrant and true. I feel the need to mention this next part, since I have read so many reviews regarding this. As with all bold colors, it can be messy, these colors are \\&quot;SEMI-PERMANENT\\&quot; so you need to keep in mind that it is going to wash out when you shower (not all at once, but little by little). Again that is with ALL colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manic Panic I love and continue to use!</li>
    <li> I got this for my 13-year-old who wanted to experiment with funky colors.  It was a vibrant purple on her red hair and looked beautiful.  It was also very temporary (lasted less than two weeks) which was perfect for her to try things out.  So if you&#x27;re looking for something that will last then this is not the product.  But if you&#x27;re just trying things out or want temporary color it&#x27;s great!  (Plus it was a fun flashback to high school, when it was either this, punky color, or kool-aid)</li>
    <li> Manic Panic products are great they have no harsh smell!! the color looks great on your hair. Manic Panic dye does not dry out your hair either infact its just the opposite it conditions. Awesome Product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I applied this product right after using Inebrya to bleach my hair, and the results came out really pretty. I had majorly stubborn orange/red tones haunting my hair (my grandmother had orange-red hair and I started with dark brown hair). I mixed it with my shampoo and left in on for a couple minutes, and the carrotness was gone and a near-platinum blond and light purple streaks remained (which I was aiming for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a rather small jar for the price and for how long it lasts, but the result is soft and shiny hair. I will have to try different colors in the future after I give my hair its needed 2nd round of bleaching in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to lighten my hair so I thought Ill try this on my dark hair. It doesn&#x27;t work so I recommend this for people with light hair. I thought I might be able to get some what of a purple tint but...nope.. its okay though I had a feeling that this will work on LIGHT hair ONLY. I will try again.. after lightening my hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite manic panic color I&#x27;ve used with and without lightening my hair(I&#x27;m African American with medium brown hair) and it&#x27;s worked great both times. It kind of comes off blue indoors but vibrant in the sun. I also have locs now and have used it on them and it works great just as nice as on loose hair</li>
    <li> This turned my already blonde hair into a nice shade of purple. Over a week, it did fade a little, but not as bad as other brands. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Stays for two shampoos. I would not label them as semi-permanent.  Good  for touch-ups in between colorings. My stylist uses Pravana dyes and they are much more vibrant and last a lot longer. I used this only on two bleached streaks, so I can&#x27;t speak for it being used as an all over color.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have naturally gray white hair and I use this to get an hombre affect from gray to light purple to dark purple. It does get messy but it lasts about two months.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of the dark haired ppl saying it showed up bright and vibrant, I got excited and bought it right away (my hair is dark brown). After following the directions to the T and rinsing, I became discouraged  because it looked nothing like the pictures.  Mt hair dried and still nothing.  I don&#x27;t recommend this for ppl with dark hair color. Don&#x27;t even waste your $. I&#x27;m really pissed because I was looking forward to this new look.</li>
    <li> Very blue purple. I think it would be improved with just a hint of more pink undertones just to give the color a little more depth.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another color and mix on my next application. Otherwise works as advertised.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a cheaper brand that I use (Adore) and the first time you wash your hair post dying it, most of the color comes out. The containers aren&#x27;t that big so expect to buy a lot more of these to keep your vibrant violet color in tact.</li>
    <li> First off, BEWARE! This may turn a blueish/greenish on virgin, dirty blonde hair when it is fading out. I bought this in order to mix with the Fuschia Shock color from Manic Panic but also did a few strands of just Ultra Violet for my nieces. When it was washing out, it did turn quite a sickly color so that wasn&#x27;t nice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is a great, cheap toner. I have dyed ash-blonde hair and use this every other wash to keep from going yellow/brassy and maintaing a more natural hue. I know that Manic Panic also sells a toner specifically for white hair but I feel like this is a better value since it is so saturated that I only need to mix slightly less than a teaspoon amount into a handful of regular conditioner. Instead of buying the pricey \\&quot;purple toning conditioner\\&quot; I create my own! I have used this jar of dye for this purpose for 6 months now, twice a week, and it&#x27;s still more than halfway full. Great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even distilled with 4 parts conditioner to 1 part dye, its stains badly, so mix your conditioner and dye with a stick of some sort first. Then, when in the shower, apply with your hands like regular conditioner after shampooing, making sure to work it into all of your hair. You have to do this pretty quickly or rinse your hands often in the process because it does leave your palms and nails purple. Then I twist up into a bun on top of my head and let it sit while I shave and all that. About 10 minutes. I rinse and that&#x27;s all! Toned, cool blonde hair at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Probably great. I bought it and never used it.  Why WHY WHY do I do this.</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly when it said it would, and applied super easy. DO use some oil or something on your skin, as it&#x27;s a little easy to get onto ears. I dyed a base dirty blonde and ended with a silvery purple and would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I turned to Manic Panic first because I love the fact that they never test anything on animals and are non-toxic.  (It even smells like blueberries somehow....)  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not a very vibrant purple, even applied on 40-bleached hair.  It also washed out rather fast compared to a Manic Panic green I used to use a few years ago.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to dye my hair but I was afraid to damage my curls. What I did was lighten my hair without using bleach so the purple could be more vibrant and noticeable. That did a little damage but not as much as bleaching it would have done. After lightening it I did a protein treatment (eggs &amp; coconut oil) to revive my curls then I left the manic panic in my hair for 3 hours. Since it has no harsh chemicals and vegan it can be left longer. Don&#x27;t shampoo!! Cowash instead when you need to cleanse your hair. Once it faded I just redyed it. I love that I can redye what has faded as many times as I want without damaging my hair. Awesome product. If you have light hair you&#x27;re soooo lucky but I still recommend for darker hair. Worth a try if you want some change</li>
    <li> This colorant sticks to my hair better than most brands, which works fabulously for toning down yellow in blonde air. After 2 weeks, I still have silver color in my blonde hair, while other direct dyes (and Shimmer Lights and L&#x27;Oreal Silver shampoos) are long gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix this with conditioner for a transparent weak dye and it still tends to turn blue-purple. It&#x27;s really strong! Used at full strength, it should color most blonde hues a vivid orchid purple.</li>
    <li> I PREVIOUSLY WAS USING PURPLE HAZE ON MY HAIR AND THIS COLOR REALLY HELPED GETTING MY HAIR A BRIGHTER PURPLE YET IT IS STILL SUBTLE  :)</li>
    <li> Nice, gorgeous color.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely suggest if you&#x27;re looking for a vibrant colour,</li>
    <li> The color works okay in my teen&#x27;s light brown hair. But we found that the Manic Panic &amp;#34;Amplified&amp;#34; works better. Especially the Amp in Red. The blue did not show much at all. This product is easy to use, with no bad smell, and is not damaging to hair. It lasts through several washes.</li>
    <li> Very nice shade, though it&#x27;s far more blue-ish than expected. Will wash out to blue/perriwinkle, and fades very fast. Doesn&#x27;t stain other things (towels, sheets) quite as much as other dyes I&#x27;ve used, which is nice.</li>
    <li> The color isn&#x27;t bad. I just did it a few days ago but like it so far. I had some pink still left in my hair when I put it in, so mine turned sort of a plum color with a blend of purple. People that have seen it, like it so far. I may put another layer on soon to see if I can darken it up a bit. Not sure yet since I am kind of curious to see what it fades out to.</li>
    <li> It looked nice, but bled everywhere and washed out after one wash.</li>
    <li> Got it really quick! It only took two days to get it! Got it brand new in original packaging!  Love manic panic hair dye!</li>
    <li> The vegan dye, living up to its name, did no damage to my hair at all. Contents are tightly sealed. Only hitch is opening the seal was quite a feat, i resorted to using a penknife to cut it.</li>
    <li> Eep. I should have listened to my friends and not used this on bleached hair. It fades quickly and it fades to a sickly grey color on bleached hair in just a couple of weeks. On dark hair it simply fades to nothing in a few washes. Have had much better results with another brand.</li>
    <li> We used this in my daughter&#x27;s light brown hair to dye the tips (about the last 2&amp;#34; of her hair) and it came out looking great once it was done.  Unfortunately, after 2-3 washings, the color is almost entirely gone.  I heard that a lot of people have had success with the Special Effects brand of hair dye so I think I&#x27;ll check that one out next time around.</li>
    <li> I really loved the vibrant color..so beautiful. The only problem I found was it washes out waay to fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a number of reviews saying that this product works great with dark brown hair, however, for me it did not work what so ever. If you are planning to color your hair the true color of this pigment you must lighten your hair. I wanted to avoid lightening my hair due to the damage however putting on the dye without lightening turned my hair in a very slight darker shade with no purple in it what so ever. With semi-permanent products the pigment washes off very easily and gets EVERYWHERE. My pillow case is stained forever. If you want to go purple and your not sure if you want to commit for permanent color dyes then try this product to experiment with the color, but you MUST have light color hair in order for the pigment to show, if you have dark brown hair like me ITS NOT GOING TO WORK.</li>
    <li> Delivery was Good. Dye not satisfied, didn&#x27;t Work.</li>
    <li> Washed out in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Fades out quickly - even when using &amp;#34;color safe&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is one of my very favorite colors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It&#x27;s a vibrant purple and even my own mother loved it!  (and THAT is great!)  For best results, use Manic Panic Flash Lightning to bleach out your hair, then dry it, and then apply the color.  Let it set up for 30 minutes under a plastic cap, and then uncover and wash out.  I always wash my hair out 3 times with good clear shampoo to make sure that the excess is totally out, and the color is still eye-popping.  You can NOT go wrong with Manic Panic!  Plus, I reckon that any people named &amp;#34;Trish&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Snooky&amp;#34; should probably know something about hair products.</li>
    <li> I have this one as of now! And i love this purple.. my favorite. Arrived on time i loved it! i dont have other words</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, received many compliments</li>
    <li> GREAT!! just great... the quality, the color... and it lasted for ever in my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I told my little team of gymnasts that I would dye my hair purple if they made it to state (purple is our team color). This stated that is is a temporary hair coloring so I thought it&#x27;d be perfect. It took about a week&#x27;s worth of showers to wash out, but as it faded, it was never a bad color. The purple just lightened little by little. I have light blonde hair so the purple really popped and was a great color. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Manic Panic Ultra Violet is a stunning purple hair dye that, unfortunately, is about as lasting as Crayola washable markers :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural hair is very thick and very black. Prior to dyeing my hair, I bleached the strands framing my face to a light straw blonde. Then I slathered the goopy dye all throughout my bleached hair, slapped a plastic cap over my head, and let it saturate overnight for 12 hours. I rinsed it off the next day with white vinegar and icy water. The end result was a beautifully intense, deep blue-purple. (A word of warning: while this dye is free of noxious chemicals and smells, it is VERY staining. I didn&#x27;t apply Vaseline and my hairline was purple for two days--to say nothing of my sink.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the lovely violet hue did not last the week. First, the color around my hairline faded to white, as a result of contact with water whenever I washed my face. Then I made the unfortunate mistake of washing my hair (hah), and my hair immediately dulled from deep purple to blotchy blue-gray-yellow, with especial fading at the ends and at the hairline. A mere week had passed since I initially colored it, and I was already forced to retouch my hair! The second time around, I left the dye on for only 30 minutes, and applied strong heat via blowdryer throughout. Same result: gorgeous purple that rapidly faded into a murky bleached mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is just too high-maintenance, even if you only wash your hair once a week, as I did. It doesn&#x27;t wash out evenly, stubbornly clinging onto the middle of the strands, while readily fading at the roots and at the ends--and just like a toner, it discolors bleached hair, leaving it a gross gray. This hair dye is definitely not worth the hassle of bleaching and weekly reapplications.</li>
    <li> The color fades after 1 day to wash it</li>
    <li> I use the ultra violet on my dark blonde hair and it looks awesome! I put it on and then wrap my hair in plastic and leave it like that for 24 hours. When I wash it out it is a very vibrant purple and it looks awesome.  To keep the color since it&#x27;s not permanent I was my hair only once a week and use dry shampoo the rest of the time.  As it washes out it becomes a really pretty pastel color and pastel hair is really popular right now.  My hair is shoulder length and it takes almost the whole jar, so if you have long hair I would suggest getting 2 jars, or if you want it to be more pastel from the get go add a little conditioner to the mixture to &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; it out.</li>
    <li> I love the Manic Panic products; Vegan, no chemicals, not tested on animals and it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a brunette (dark, dark brown!) and refuse to lighten/bleach my hair to achieve the purple.  I know it&#x27;s silly, but I refuse to put chemicals in it.  So, for the Manic Panic, here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Pre-wash and dry hair (I use DevaCare No Poo shampoo &amp; conditioner...you don&#x27;t have to have curly hair to use Deva&#x27;s line - there are no harsh chemicals which is why I use it, even though I do have curly hair, I recommend it anyway)&lt;br /&gt;2.) Add color to hair.  I separated my hair and did Manic Panic in Ultra-Violet, Midnight and Vampire Red.  NOTE: Prior to adding color, you might want to slap some vaseline around hair line, ears, neck...or get a hair coloring stick called Remedy from Sallys...either way, protect the skin because it WILL stain.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Slap on a shower cap...because you can never be too sexy!&lt;br /&gt;4.) I bought a &#x27;heat helmet&amp;#34;...it&#x27;s like a heating pad for your hair :) I put it on for 30 minutes, off for 30.  I did this for a total of 3 hours.  NOTE: Because this is a conditioning color, it will NOT harm your hair no matter how long you keep it in! The longer the better because it is like a conditioning mask&lt;br /&gt;5.) OK...the RINSE! :) Mix 50/50 of vinegar and cold water and spritz into hair and comb.  I got impatient and just dumped the bottle on my hair (upside down over sink) and combed it.  YES, it will stain, but COMET takes it right out of a porcelain or cast iron tubs/showers.  I&#x27;ve had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;6.) DO NOT wash with shampoo or conditioner...because you just conditioned it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;7.) Style and go :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the color last longer, don&#x27;t wash so often.  Mix some water and essential lavender oil together and spritz on scalp and rub with fingertips if you want a &#x27;clean scalp&#x27; in between wash days.  Plus, it&#x27;s good for you to not wash your hair daily anyway! My color stays vibrant for about 3 weeks, but I wash my hair only 1-2 times/week.  But, I&#x27;ve gotten a good 6 weeks of noticeable color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I had super-dark hair.  However, in the sun light, flourescent lights, my flood lights outside...the red, blue and purple really add a gorgeous ting without being &#x27;punk&#x27; (since I had a professional job, I have to be careful...however I&#x27;m a Zumba instructor too, so I gotta have fun!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the HOT PINK as well from Manic Panic and loved the results on that as well.  I&#x27;m excited to try the turquoise and green to see what happens with that as well.  My hairdresser was jealous of the color because she&#x27;s been trying to achieve it on me anyway with Framesi color line, but without lightening it, we couldn&#x27;t do it.  Manic Panic actually gave me the color I wanted without hurting my hair :)  Check out Manic Panic&#x27;s website as well for more tips.  I would&#x27;ve never tried it if it weren&#x27;t for reading all their tips.  For the price, it&#x27;s worth trying out...even if you do have dark hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/21/15 - was asked for pics.  Since that time, I ended up having my hair professionally lightened (which I regretted).  I got tired of the $120+ upkeep and used Manic Panic for my touch-up.  They&#x27;re bleached about 4 inches from root and down (but not BLEACH blonde).  Color held very well and looks great.  I wish I had a pic of it on my actual natural dark hair, but I can tell you this, it shows up like it does in the &amp;#34;wet hair&amp;#34; pic.wash my hair only 1-2 times/week.  But, I&#x27;ve gotten a good 6 weeks of noticeable color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I had super-dark hair.  However, in the sun light, flourescent lights, my flood lights outside...the red, blue and purple really add a gorgeous ting without being &#x27;punk&#x27; (since I had a professional job, I have to be careful...however I&#x27;m a Zumba instructor too, so I gotta have fun!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the HOT PINK as well from Manic Panic and loved the results on that as well.

    <li> Beautiful color.  The color can be made lighter by adding conditioner to it.  I have been playing with it to create different shades of purple all summer!  Very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this dye multiple times hoping that everytime I use it, I will obtain the results that everyone else seems to get. But NO! every single time that I have used this dye, the result is the same. i end up with bright BLUE hair without a hint of violet anywhere! i don&#x27;t understand why this keeps happening, I&#x27;ve put it over bleached hair and i keep getting the same result. The only time it turned remotely purple was when i put it over pink strands of hair. I am so frustrated with this product. Will not be buying this color again.</li>
    <li> The main reason I went for this product was the great reviews I had seen on Amazon.  The dye looked good after letting it set and rinsing with cold water.  The dye was allowed to be in my hair for a good 30 minutes as instructed(probably a bit longer actually).  Once my hair dried, it looked amazing and I was excited to have my hair that way as I had never dyed my hair an exotic color.  When I rinsed my hair, we allowed it to rinse with cold water until there was no more color running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I washed my hair, I used my Herbal Essences Shampoo and Conditioner for dyed hair and after washing my hair three times, the color is now almost completely gone.  I have blonde hair and it now sort of just has a purplish tint but it doesn&#x27;t pop like it did when first dyed.  I am sad that this was my first experience dying my hair a fun color as I have been excited for this.</li>
    <li> not too happy with it. I know Manic Panic products don&#x27;t last that long usually, but this purple is worse than most. My hair currently is &#x27;atomic turqoise&#x27; and &#x27;ultra violet&#x27;, and I&#x27;ve had it that way for over a month. I havent had to re-dye the blue at all (it has faded, but it&#x27;s still looking pretty good), but I&#x27;ve had to re-dye the purple THREE TIMES. it fades to a ugly greyish color after Like three or four hair washes. Not a product I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Loooove manic panic hair dyes! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is I wish the jars were bigger, as I have to re order fairly often but this is a great product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product, worked perfectly when mixed with conditioner to add a lavender tint.</li>
    <li> I bot bad boy blue and purple amethyst. I love the colors. I recommend leaving it in for a couple of hours to get a more darker look. And apply a few coats. It&#x27;s my first time using this brand I like it so far. I didn&#x27;t bleach it before either and I like how it turned out. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh dye smell and my hair is still soft. It&#x27;s a great dye if your willing to keep up with it.</li>
    <li> Love Manic Panic and this color is to &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34; for. I&#x27;ve received many compliments. This product arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite color by manic panic. I have white hair from bleaching and the dye is amazing because its beautiful dark and fades into an absolutely beautiful pastel purple.</li>
    <li> The color turned out a lot darker then it looks. The dye is very thick; because of this I had to use my hands to get it to spread evenly. The dye came out in two washes.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and DON&#x27;T shampoo, so I was pretty surprised when the color came out after just one conditioning. I&#x27;m told it lasts longer if you use heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have \\&quot;darkest brown\\&quot; hair and I used the volume 30 lightening kit to bleach streaks in it. Then I mixed Ultra Violet and Virgin White, to get out some of the orange. I left it in about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was perfect: It made the streaks deep purple, and the non-bleached hair just looked jet-black, which is what I wanted. If only it hadn&#x27;t all come out right away. After all that work, it was a bummer! Next time I will try the \\&quot;amplified\\&quot; version.</li>
