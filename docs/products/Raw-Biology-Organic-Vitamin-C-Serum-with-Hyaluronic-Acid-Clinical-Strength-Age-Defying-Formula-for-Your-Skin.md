    <li> My face feels so fresh and soft after using this product.  I find it is amazing in such a short time to see such results</li>
    <li> I have used other serums that claim to firm and  increase collagen but have always been disappointed, until now, wow your vitamin C Serum has really made a noticeable difference in my skin. I can honestly say that in just two short weeks I have seen my jaw line tighten up and there is a fresh glow that has been missing for a very long time. Thank you I will be sure to reorder. Julia</li>
    <li> I am addicted to Organic Vitamin C Serum. After just two weeks my skin is glowing. This serum is so light, not harsh on my super sensitive skin.  It has no odor and never irritates my skin. I am actually  leaving my house without makeup these days. It is truly anti aging.  This is an awesome rejuvenating serum.</li>
    <li> OMG this product is really concentrated! It take about two weeks to work on peelings but it does work very well. I add it also on some homemade lotions to keep sking healthy.</li>
    <li> The best product on the market. My cabinet is full of products purchased claiming to be an end all for tired skin but I believe you have discovered the fountain of youth. The value is in this product and to need only one bottle to pack for travel is a blessing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, under my eyes.  Dark skin there appears a little lighter now.  Product is easy to use - great dispenser - it goes on smooth, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, and it vanishes into your skin after a few minutes.  It never stings, even when you use it on compromised skin.  Quality ingredients, and a further plus is the green glass bottle they use instead of plastic.</li>
    <li> I just started using the vitamin c with the retinol and saw a big improvement in the spots under my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;These serums of not dry my eyes out like I have experienced before using a spot corrector.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great! I work in an oily environment and find it hard to keep excess oil at bay resulting in spots, after just over a week of using this product there was a clear decrease in spots and although my face wasn&#x27;t as oily I didn&#x27;t feel like my face was dry or sore.</li>
    <li> I am excited to see the results from this product, since it has only been a few days since I have received it and had the chance to use it. All the advertising out there is for Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid to be the specific combination to help this age-defying skin for women. I know I will continue to use this product for that reason alone.  Thank You, for making products that are reasonably priced!!</li>
    <li> Reccommend this, great for skin</li>
    <li> I am happy with the prompt delivery service and I cannot wait to use this product.. I will follow up in a few weeks and let you know how I like the product overall. Happy I got my new serum :)</li>
    <li> Like how this goes on and how it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I already see and feel a difference in just a few weeks!  My skin feels smoother and softer and my skin tone looks more even. I have melasma pretty much all over my face, and while I know it will never go completely away, it is such a relief to have found a product that lightens and brightens my skin. The darker spots on my face are not the first thing I see in the mirror anymore!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks and feels after several months of use.</li>
    <li> Very impressed! Smells fresh and feels great on the skin!</li>
    <li> I have a stubborn age spot on my left cheek.  I am using Raw Biology Vitamin C Serum to improve it.  I like how smooth my skin feels after applying.  Time and Vitamin C will be the great healer and staying out of the sun.  Applying it on the backs of my hands also.  This has been the best product I have used for this condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C along with the Retinol and have seen a reduction of sun spots and acne scars, this soaks right into my skin with no stickiness and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Wish I had found this sooner!!</li>
    <li> works good but very watery so much is wasted</li>
    <li> I loved how the Vitamin C Serum made my skin feel so smooth.  It gave my skin a glow that I haven&#x27;t had in a long time.  I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I was a little bit disappointed bec I thought it was 20% vitamin C but it was only 18%. Im really looking for a 100% vit C but I think it only comes in a 20% max. I have to use it thou. Not really satisfied. If you have a higher percentage of the C I&#x27;d be happy to buy one!</li>
    <li> I found that this serum did lighten my dark spots a little. It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> love your vitamin c will keep on useing thank you for these products</li>

    <li> A very good product for acne scarring and for the marks I have on my legs from a bike accident a few years ago.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for five days now and my skin is already responding.  I have noticed a reduction in the lines around my lips, and my dark circles seem to be fading.  I am using it with the retinol A serum and the hyaluronic acid, also from RAW BIOLOGY.</li>
    <li> First let me say, the customer service from this company Raw Biology is bar none the best service that I have received in years!  The product are nicely pack, and easy to use. The shipping is fast and on time. Wonderful Seller, wonderful Product, wonderful delivery, even early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out just using the Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C. The results are still continues to amaze me. I was extremely happy with the results from just the single product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I had a chance to extend my boundaries and with what was on the Dr Oz who about these sorts of products, told us how wonderfully they worked for us women who want to be the best we can be, with out the dangerous surgery&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched the products from that show and was horrified at the cost that came along with it. So I started searching. The price of 100.00 was not in my income bracket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have friends that use over the counter products, paying up to and over the amount that these miracle workers that Dr Oz, talked about, and since I seen no results, I wasn&#x27;t about to spend that money on products that dont work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, Raw Biology! Lady&#x27;s it works! For a fraction of the cost of the same products, you to can enjoy looking in the mirror and seeing true results! I do every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said I started out just using the Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C. I seen results in just 2 days, my boyfriend friend looked at me and said, &amp;#34;Tami your skin looks like it did 30 years ago&amp;#34; he wanted to know what I was doing. I told him of the new product, and he said that he would even use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy and used my product everyday. The results continued. Then I was reading again on the article from Dr Oz, and seen that there was actually two products he endorsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to see that Raw Biology had the second product. I got some. And again the price is a fraction of the cost. You can&#x27;t even buy the over the counter stuff for the cost of these products, and the OTC products dont work! These products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is how I use this amazing Organic Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I either exfoliate, ( I do 3 Times a week ) or wash my face with soap and hot water. I pat dry. I apply Raw Biology Organic Vitamin C. I wait 15 minutes, I then add the Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid, and wait another 15 minutes. At this time I add a very good moisturizer. And since I walk everyday in the sun up to 10 miles a day, I add sun screen after the moisturizer . At night before bedtime I do the same thing again, minus the sun block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face looks amazing! Fine lines are almost gone, my skin tone has evened out, age spots are gone. I am 56 and am from Arizona and Nevada, I&#x27;ve been a sun baby my whole life, and I don&#x27;t need to tell you about sun damage, and we all know what age does to our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cost of this product, and don&#x27;t forget free shipping, its a fraction of the cost of products that dont work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so worth ur time, and for pennies a day, worth your money for true results! My first bottle I bought 2 months ago and I&#x27;ve only use 3/4 a bottle. So needless to da it takes very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your worth it! And this is a product and a company that goes beyond today&#x27;s customer service. They are in my opinion, the best customer service around. More like the days of my youth, where companies cared about their customers and word of mouth mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself! I did!se products, and the OTC products dont work! These products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is how I use this amazing Organic Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I either exfoliate, ( I do 3 Times a week ) or wash my face with soap and hot water. I pat dry. I apply Raw Biology Organic Vitamin C. I wait 15 minutes, I then add the Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid, and wait another 15 minutes. At this time I add a very good moisturizer. And since I walk everyday in the sun up to 10 miles a day, I add sun screen after the moisturizer . At night before bedtime I do the same thing again, minus the sun block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face looks amazing! Fine lines are almost gone, my skin tone has evened out, age spots are gone. I am 56 and am from Arizona and Nevada, I&#x27;ve been a sun baby my whole life, and I don&#x27;t need to tell you about sun damage, and we all know what age does to our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cost of this product, and don&#x27;t forget free shipping, its a fraction of the cost of products that dont work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so worth ur time, and for pennies a day, worth your money for true results! My first bottle I bought 2 months ago and I&#x27;ve only use 3/4 a bottle. So needless to da it takes very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your worth it! And this is a product and a company that goes beyond today&#x27;s customer service. They are in my opinion, the best customer service around. More like the days of my youth, where companies cared about their customers and word of mouth mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself! I did!</li>
    <li> Good product. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as part of the trinity which included retinol and hyaluronic acid.  I have been using these products as part of my skincare routine for a number of years.  I have tried every brand out there and can safely say that these guys have the best quality products.  I experienced a noticeable difference in my skin quality and appearance rapidly and have received comments from people very soon after using the product.  My skin feels both tight and smooth in a way I haven&#x27;t experienced with other products.  From a price standpoint, buying the three products together is great value and even separately I found Raw Biology to offer the best value for money.  I received my order before the expected delivery date and I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for long term exceptional clear skin results.</li>
