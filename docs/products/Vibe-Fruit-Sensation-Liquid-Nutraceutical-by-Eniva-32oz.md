<li> My husband used this product a few years ago but had been off it until we found it here on amazon, he restarted his regimen as soon as the vibe arrived, and in 2 days had already mentioned feeling better, my husband is Techquad and suffers from bladder and kidney stones, this can make some day to day activities very uncomfortable, since restarting vibe he has less complaints of urinary discomfort and a more energized overall feeling of well being.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really in it for taste anyway, it&#x27;s all the benefits that matter.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but isn&#x27;t your health worth it?</li>

<li> I been using it a little over a week</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t take this product for the taste, I take it because my body is in trouble without it.</li>
<li> As for kids... when I was growing up, my mother forced mineral oil down my throat, and Epsom salt  ie; magnesium -</li>
<li> it still not good.</li>
<li> yep, there will be those who will hate it.</li>
<li> this juice is so disgusting....</li>
<li> Oh my goodness that was awful...</li>

    <li> Excellent product, very beneficial to my health. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My husband used this product a few years ago but had been off it until we found it here on amazon, he restarted his regimen as soon as the vibe arrived, and in 2 days had already mentioned feeling better, my husband is Techquad and suffers from bladder and kidney stones, this can make some day to day activities very uncomfortable, since restarting vibe he has less complaints of urinary discomfort and a more energized overall feeling of well being. When he first started vibe years ago the taste left much to be desired, this time we purchased the fruit sensation, and compliments to Eniva on their efforts to try and add some flavor. All in all this product is a great vitamin supplement for ANYONE.</li>
    <li> product was as advertised and delivered in a timely fashion</li>
    <li> This is a great Vitamin supplement, giving you high doses of fruits and veggies. It&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t interact with my medications. I had problems taking pill forms of vitamins, heart racing, not feeling so great. I been feeling more focused, more energy, and overall healthier by taking 1oz of vibe daily. I been using it a little over a week and im impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the taste, some might not care for it. I add 1oz of Vibe in 12 oz of water and it taste like a fruity healthy cocktail. I&#x27;m not really in it for taste anyway, it&#x27;s all the benefits that matter. If you don&#x27;t get enough fruits and veggies on a daily basis or you take medications (check with your doctor first always) this could be the right vitamin supplement for you. I haven&#x27;t found anything so natural. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but isn&#x27;t your health worth it?</li>
    <li> Love the ease of adding it to my morning orange juice, great way to get the vitamins I need every day.</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin &amp;#34;Alive&amp;#34; try &amp;#34;VIBE&amp;#34; BY ENIVA....</li>
    <li> It makes my head spin when I read reviews where people are talking about taste! I started off taking Eniva products drinking the actual clear solution minerals that were horrid! And you couldn&#x27;t STOP ME from getting it in me. I don&#x27;t take this product for the taste, I take it because my body is in trouble without it. To even mention the taste is a sign of immaturity. As for kids... when I was growing up, my mother forced mineral oil down my throat, and Epsom salt  ie; magnesium - in a bit of water. Oh my goodness that was awful... but... my mother loved me. She didn&#x27;t care how it tasted, her FIRST concern was my HEALTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a grip! Get this down your throat, and your children as well - when the body starts receiving the important nutrients that it needs, the important minerals that it needs, the taste becomes irrelevant as you began to feel GOOD! Have more energy, start to sleep better. Feel better. See clearer. It&#x27;s NOT a miracle drug... you still need to eat right - exercise - and maintain a healthy lifestyle... however, THIS VIBE - goes a long way with helping you get on track. Because of this, changing our eating habits, and exercising... my husband who used to be a diabetic, have high blood pressure and cholesterol is off of ALL the prescription drugs with all NORMAL readers, gluclose, cholesterol and blood pressure... ALL normal! Did VIBE do that? NO, of course not. BUT - it gave his body what he needed along with various healthy foods, to correct the wrongs that were there. It helped to prove, that we should all, \\&quot;Let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food!\\&quot; Hippocrates - he was right on the money and correct!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last... I add it to water, stir and drink it down. It actually tastes like juice, the dominant flavor is Blackcurrant, personally, I don&#x27;t like blackcurrant at all... but... again, taste is not a priority for me, good health is. There will be those, who will LOVE the taste and yep, there will be those who will hate it. But since it&#x27;s about your HEALTH and getting those important fruits and vegetables in you so your body can start to heal itself - yeah... as for the taste ... get over it! I did... I don&#x27;t even think about it now, it&#x27;s an important part of my morning routine.t.

    <li> This is a very good supplement.  The price is reasonable.  It tastes good and is easy to take.  I find that it works well in conjunction with my regular multivitamin.</li>
    <li> this juice is so disgusting....no kid will drink it. I bought it for my ADHD child....also it is way to expensiv. my son is not picky... eats everything.....but that juice. I even mixed it with other juice ...it still not good. I  would not recommend Eniva  for Kids.</li>
    <li> This stuff really makes your skin and just plain everything feel amazing. It started out as I gotta try this stuff and iam hooked big time.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever!!  I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I have been taking this supplement for 10 years. It is filled with quality vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. The price for what you get is reasonable.</li>
    <li> A little sweet, but everyone I know who uses this, loves it.  I immediately felt more alert and focused.  Will definitely continue to use it!</li>
    <li> It arrived.in a timely manner, and more importantly it was sealed.</li>
    <li> The results for me weren&#x27;t fast, but all of a sudden I no longer catch colds as easy and I overall don&#x27;t require as much sleep.  I just feel better!</li>
    <li> I have used it for 7 years and love it still.  Children thrive on it too.  We notice a difference in just having good nutrition that is bioavailable.</li>
    <li> I can feel more energy when I use this product. The taste is not bad.</li>
    <li> it is a great help to me and my health</li>
    <li> Thank you , very satisfied with this purchased.</li>
