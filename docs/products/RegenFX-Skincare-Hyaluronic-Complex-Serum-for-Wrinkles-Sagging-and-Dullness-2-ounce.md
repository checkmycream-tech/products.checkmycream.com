<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I liked this product, but the smell was a bit off and made me nautious.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Seems to help with texture and tone. Non-greasy and light.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first but I really do like it definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Good product. I gave this to my mom and she is in love.  She had nothing but good things to say. I got this to try for free thanks to snagshout.</li>
    <li> sNAGSHOUT.COM Allowed for me to snag this item for free. I love making sure my face stays wrinkle free I can not wait to try this product even more so because I got it for free everyone loves free especially me!!</li>
    <li> This serum seems &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;, not a miracle worker but is hopefully helping! It is a bit sticky in my opinion, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a promotional coupon to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Pump in bottle did not work.  No way to screw top off to utilize.  Wasted money.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this for free to review and was so excited because my skin is crazy sensitive and I have a lot of acne scarring. The first thing I noticed when trying this was that it kind of burned. It wasn&#x27;t in a bad way though, I think it was just because my skin was so dry. Slowly, with each day, it burns a little less so I think that&#x27;s a good sign. This also makes my face feel more taunt, which definitely makes me think it&#x27;s helping with sagging, etc. I can&#x27;t be sure yet if it is doing anything for the acne scars but I&#x27;m hoping by the end of the bottle it will be very evident. Regardless, I love that I can tell this stuff is moisturizing and tightening my skin. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate it, which isn&#x27;t something I can say about all age-defying stuff. So, all in all, loving this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d love to try your product</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I am still young but I noticed some laugh lines starting to show. I have used it for almost a week and I have noticed the lines are starting to fade. I will be recommending  this to my mom. I love how it it is not sticky either and has a nice scent.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I received this about four days ago maybe, maybe less.. The packaging was great, I got it with some of my other prime products ( I realllllllyyyyy am going to miss prime when my free trail is up, but prime costs alot!!! Even compared to the savings and the stuff you get with prime that&#x27;s a huge chunk of money to pay at once for something) but any ways like I was saying it was packaged great, the delivery was fast, come in a few days earlier then expected and as for the product it self I love it so far, I haven&#x27;t got to really use it yet but the for days I have it makes my skin feel great, it smells clean and fresh ( it has a little chemical smell to it but not enough to make me hate it) the container is easy to use and so far I really love this product! I&#x27;m going to keep using it and in about two weeks or if anything happens sooner I will update my review to let you guys know if my skin/ feels looks better, if this stuff really works or if my thoughts turn negative in any way... But until then know that as of right now I do think this makes my skin feel awesome, the smell is nice, products easy to use and the feel of my skin after use is soft and kind of tight like it really maybe working! As of right now I would recommend and I hope I found a face cream gel that works!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how this product makes my skin feel smooth. Not only I can tell this product works but my family and friends as well! I have received so many compliments on my when. Thanks! Keep up the great products!</li>
    <li> Did not live up to product reviews...that, after further review, were &amp;#34;paid&amp;#34;reviews. Very little moisturizing effect and sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> Another good quality product! I would recommend this serum to anybody. It gives my face a more youthful appearance because it fills in the fine lines in between my eyebrows</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every morning for 5 days. Haven&#x27;t really seen any changes, so I will continue with this product for another nine days &amp; check back with my review.</li>
    <li> It works great, but, made my face break out.</li>
    <li> Have been using this along with the moisturizer for about a week. Skin is smoother,  brighter &amp; has a more even tone. Absorbs quickly &amp; creates a good pallet for moisturizer. Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in fine lines. Receiveded this complimentary in order to test &amp; review- no compensation was provided.</li>
    <li> I was given the RegenFX Anti Aging Eye Gel for Dark Circles, RegenFX Ultimate Hualuronic Acid Serum, and RegenFX Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream for free to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using all three products as a system for a few weeks now and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I&#x27;m a 45 year old woman who has little by way of wrinkles, but there are a couple of trouble spots that I was hoping this would help - some fine lines on my forehead and between my eyes at the bridge of my nose. There does not seem to be any difference in the appearance of those lines. The biggest disappointment, though, is the way this product feels on my face. It feels, after it dries, like having a thin layer of dried glue on my face. It is not a pleasant feeling for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is even when it&#x27;s coupled with the Moisturizer Cream. This cream is nice and light and has a lovely, herbal-minty fragrance that is not overbearing. But, it does not seem to be a great moisturizer for me. I&#x27;m going to put it away and try it again in the summer when its light weight might be just enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye Gel has done nothing for the dark circles around my eyes - bear in mind that I think the bulk of my problem there is genetic. The gel is nice and soothing after a long day, however.</li>
    <li> I love the way this lotion made my face feel but it didn&#x27;t do much as for my appearance. I could feel that it made my skin tighter but that effect didn&#x27;t last long either, kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum. Once I started using it the skin looked rejuvenated, it seems more hydrated, and the color of the skin looks more uniform and it has less brown spots. The serum worked in an approximately a week that was when my husband told me that my face looked younger. The serum feels great after applying it to the skin, and the combination with the vitamins in the formula make my lines under the mouth smother.</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot.  It feels really light and my skin feels tighter after it has been on for about 5 minutes.  Very reasonable, will buy it again</li>
    <li> I have used many products over the years with high hopes it would be as good as promised from reviews.  So far so good. I can not yet attest to the full affect as I have only started using it. I can however tell you that it is not sticky and I can apply it easily before applying my makeup for the day. It does smell like the other one I bought on Amazon (like pickled ginger).  I usually apply this right after I get out the shower, or after my face has just been washed, allowing for more open pores while my skin is still damp &amp; supple. That way, it seems to absorb this serum better. Once it dries (which takes about a minute or less), it will give you sort of a shiny, luminous or instant glowing effect to your skin -- which sort of has somewhat of a drying &amp; tightening effect.  I will update in a month or so..</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this (3-4 uses) &amp; really liked the feel of it and the immediate impact it had on the expression lines by my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy the full size b/c of the price, but splurged during a 20% off deal.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did because this has made an incredible difference in my skin - evening tone, smoothing texture &amp; visibly diminishing my fine lines &amp; wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;And, just as important, it did not break out my super-sensitive, acne-prone skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finishing my first bottle, I was trying to wait for another 20% off deal to repurchase (again, that hefty price tag...) but my skin started to go downhill again.&lt;br /&gt;I knew this product was effective, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference it had made until I went a month without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I have since reordered &amp; am experiencing the same results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Got at a lovely discount to try this product and i am in love! Leaves your skin soft and supple and made my wrinkles around my eyes practically disappear! I know ill need some more asap!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this new moisturizer! This stuff is affordable and amazing! It sinks in and absorbs quickly and my skin looks and feels amazing. So many products make me break out, but this is one of the few that does not. My skin looks dewy and radiant after using it! I will definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I&#x27;m already starting to see a difference. I like that the scent is not too strong. Good product!</li>
    <li> I loved RegenFX&#x27;s Serum! So far I have been using it for 4 days. I already see a difference in the softness of my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results I get after 2 weeks! I did receive this item as a gift to try. After seeing the results it will be worth buying again!</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin or anything but I like this product very much. I used it immediately and it goes on smoothly and is odorless. I woke up the next morning and my skin felt amazing! I have this and the product for dark circles under your eyes. I got this product free to sample and I will be buying it when my bottle is empty definitely</li>
    <li> Should use it a bit longer...</li>
    <li> I need a little more time to see results…but at this time it does dry out my skin. Hoping for better results soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with bottle…when I try to take the cap off the whole bottle unscrews.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot goes on smooth and makes foundation easy to apply</li>
    <li> Great item really helped.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic change in my skin or appearance.  I wish I could give it five stars, but it really isn&#x27;t any different than most face creams and their claims.  The face cream all of a sudden would not pump, so I take the top off to use.  The feel is good, but nothing to say it is great.</li>
    <li> I will give my honest opinion on it. I will focus on reasons why I chose this product, delivery time, pros and cons, and whether I would recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons why I chose this product:&lt;br /&gt;I am a 32 year-old-mom who enjoyed sunbathing most of her teenage years. As a result, I started noticing some minor wrinkles or lines mostly on my forehead. Therefore, I decided to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time:&lt;br /&gt;I have an Amazon Prime membership, so this product arrived super fast. I literally ordered it yesterday afternoon and it arrived first thing in the morning the next day, that is, less than 24 hours. Amazing! It arrived carefully wrapped, sealed and protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions on how to use this serum based on the Amazon web site. I read them carefully applied the serum into my face, having previously cleaned my face as directed. I have to say that I have super oily complexion, and I have tried several creams/lotions that leave my face oily, greasy and sweaty (specially in the summer). As soon as I applied this serum into my face following the indications on Amazon web site, the serum absorbed super fast and it DID NOT LEAVE MY FACE GREASY OR OILY. My skin looked fresher and felt clean. Because it is a gel, in comparison to a lotion, the absorbency is faster and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a heavy feeling. Honestly, I was impressed. I have spent several dollars on very expensive skin care products in the past and they left my face super oily. I also put some make up on after I left it absorb and it didn&#x27;t interfere with my make up routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on its label are very general, apply to skin after cleansing and let it absorb. So I had to go to the Amazon web site, and read further instructions on how to apply it. From there, I screen shot the instructions provided. See attachment below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the bottle doesn&#x27;t specify how much hyaluronic acid this product contains, a crucial information to miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this serum to my friends. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results of continuous future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.d this serum to my friends.

    <li> I have used this product for almost 2 months and have not noticed a significant difference. It is just okay</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Tightens skin</li>
    <li> Firms apon drying.. Great under makeup</li>
    <li> I received this as a free product to review from snagshout. I really like this and must say that it is really good. I&#x27;m enjoying the produvt and definately recommend this to others who need it!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. You can check out my full product review here: [...]</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to give a full review, but so far I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best product I have ever use to my face,with in 3 days I saw big difference on my face,such as glowness, brightness ,softness,I look 5 years younger,I just love this product,I will recomond for my family and friends ,For sure I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you much....</li>
    <li> I love this!!!  It has really made a difference on my skin.  I am always trying new products and this one wins!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for myself. This hyaluronic acid serum goes on nice and smoothly and works well with her makeup. Good product.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty large bottle for such a good quality serum. Usually you get teeny TINY bottles when you want such good ingredients. A little goes a long way, so this should last for quite some time. I use this at night before bed to get the best results. Within a really short time, I have noticed great results, I mean the ingredients speak for themselves.  It goes on really smooth, and dries quickly. Its not oily and I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues at all. This is such a high quality moisturizer I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to freshen up their complexion (without spending tons of $$$$ on a small bottled product). I did receive a discount to sample the product.</li>
    <li> This serum is really helping overall with the condition of my skin.  It is very moisturizing without causing break-outs, which my skin is prone to.  A good buy in cosmetics.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all. It&#x27;s still too soon to see any results though, as I&#x27;ve only been using it for 5 days. Praying for a miracle!?!</li>
    <li> The serum flows on so smoothly, and you need only use a very small amount.</li>
    <li> I recieved the trio of products for review, and although I didn&#x27;t love the serum, it&#x27;s the best of the 3. The day I wore the eye cream and moisturizer, my eye sockets and cheek bones broke out in tiny red splotches that resembled broken capillaries. I used the serum on a day after the splotches had gone away and just thought it was mediocre. Nothing really great, nothing terrible. Overall, just meh.</li>
    <li> I have a drawer full of serums and creams and this line is truly amazing and inexpensive. I originally purchased the under eye serum for dark circles. After two weeks they are barely visible. I then proceeded to buy the facial serum and night cream. I am a believer</li>
    <li> For the couple of days I have used it, it seems to work. But I have only had used it a couple of days. I don&#x27;t recommend putting it around your eyes for it feels like it doesn&#x27;t dry well there. It does make your face super soft. There is no heavy scent so that is also a plus side.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to try and review. I was hoping for better results in the time that I used it. It goes on smoothly and smells good, but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. I think I will stick with my usual daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I feel it tightens my skin. I like it</li>
    <li> It is the ultimate serum immediate results!!! Something to fill in lines temporary, while it does its job!!!</li>
    <li> As someone that is always on the look out for amazing skincare products that will keep my skin looking and feeling healthy, I was so excited to receive this RegenFX Ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum by RegenFX Skincare in the mail!! After testing this serum out for myself I have to say this hyaluronic acid serum is amazing and is definitely one of my favorite hyaluronic acid serums I own!! This serum made my skin look and feel amazing and healthy after using it!! This serum  is  the highest quality serum available it&#x27;s certified Pure by CCA!! This serum works wonders,  its an anti- aging serum so its designed to fill facial fine lines, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, diminish sagging, and many more amazing benefits!! This serum also restores and replenishes your skins moisture to give you a youthful glow!! This serum is fast absorbing so you will get fast results when using this amazing serum!! I definitely recommend this RegenFX ultimate Hyaluronic Acid Serum to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Thick consistency, it does not leave a sticky feeling after application.  The smell reminds me of medicinal ointment, but it does not bother me and goes away after a few minutes. I wear it at night, before going to bed. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results, but I will get back to update my review in due time.</li>
    <li> Hate It!  Its as if I were putting aloe vera on my face.  Its sticky and then peels off in a white flakey mess.  Its a scam.</li>
    <li> This product is my new go to. I originally requested a sample because of the price of the full size. (I didn’t want to pay all that money and hate it) After using the sample up, I instantly ordered the full size without hesitation. This product is defiantly worth the price! My skin has never looked so fresh and renewed! I barely get pimples anymore and my pores have shrunken. The fine lines are slowly fading but I know with time they will be completely gone!</li>
    <li> My mom fell in love with this product after one use</li>
    <li> A friend of mine has this product and I tried a little bit of it before a wedding. This product felt so amazing on my skin. I have sensitive skin and this product left my face so soft! I noticed that my pores even looked smaller with the first application! I also noticed that my friend&#x27;s skin was clearing up from the dark spots she had. I had to get this product after trying it. I received this yesterday and immediately started using it. Again, felt so soft on my skin and it dried it very quickly. I have a few dark spot on my skin and I did notice a slight change in color in the area where my dark spots are. I&#x27;m excited to continue using this in my daily beauty routine! Hello beautiful skin! I received a promo code for this product and all opinions are of my own :)</li>
    <li> I think i may return it? Im not seeing any improvement?</li>
    <li> Works great in conjunction with the Lisse et Natural Professional Strength Anti-Aging Vitamin C Serum - skin feels smooth, taught, and wrinkles are diminishing daily!</li>
    <li> love the smell and the way it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> Received product for exchange for review. The product feels good on the skin. I&#x27;m an esthetician so I will be using on my clients</li>
    <li> After putting this on for the first time, I was left with a sticky feeling left on my face. I have used many face creams and serums and have never had one like this. I saw that the asking price was $40 and I&#x27;m assuming that if you can get beyond the stickiness, that maybe it actually works?? I&#x27;m going to ask around my friends/family who would like to give this a try. Maybe they will have better luck than me and be able to tolerate the feeling.</li>
    <li> The only problem I had is the dryness after using it.</li>
    <li> Prior to trying this product, I used separate Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C serums, which I will use again when I finish this jar of RegenFX.  For my aging skin, I find the item description very overstated.  It may work best for people in late teens through 20&#x27;s before sun impact on skin and aging begin to kick in.  As for baby boomer skin, save your money.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I got this product to test from the company for free. These thoughts are my own, are truthful, and are solely based on my experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few days. First thing, the bottle is nice. I like that it came shrink wrapped. The smell is really a fresh and clean kind of smell but not over powering.  I put this product on immediately after washing my face and it has a slight tingle. Not a bad, I want to claw my face off kind. But the kind where you can feel that its tightening your skin.  After only using it for a few days I can say my face feels more moisturized than it has in months and that says a lot coming from someone with Psoriasis. Obviously, using it only the few days I haven&#x27;t noticed an immediate change in the dark spots on my skin. But I will update my review again in a month or so and let you know. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a nice serum. The consistency isn&#x27;t too thin or thick. It absorbs very quickly. I just pat it on my face with fingers, less than 30 seconds,  it gets absorbed into your skin. It&#x27;s not sticky which I like. The smell is tolerable, not bad, not good. I can&#x27;t say much about it&#x27;s moisturizing affects, though. Maybe I live in Arizona so the weather is extra dry,serum but you will need to use a moisturizer on top of this serum. It does leave your skin matte and smooth. Overall, good product, it&#x27;s still too early to say about whether it&#x27;s helping with my dark spots, but I like it so far. I will update.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this free product for my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Have not really noticed a difference after a month.</li>
    <li> Only been using a few days, but I can see a difference. My skin looks nice and plumped up with hydration. A little also goes a long way, just a drop covers my entire face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and this is just what I was looking for. My friends definitely noticed the difference</li>
    <li> My wife uses it and is too early to see the results.</li>
    <li> Saw almost immediate improvement!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in wrinkles at all. BUT, I have noticed that it helps my eyeliner not smudge. (I have oily skin, and the smearing of the eyeliner is a problem for me that normal-skinned people probably don&#x27;t have - lucky ducks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just lightly rub a dot of serum on each bottom eyelid. The liner is not completely smudgeless, but so much better than without. I would keep buying this product just for that. I usually don&#x27;t wear eye shadow, so I haven&#x27;t tested it on the top lid.</li>
    <li> Had an allergic reaction</li>
    <li> I waited until I used the product  for a week before writing any review.  I have many allergies to product&#x27;s and very sensitive skin.  I was very excited to try this product but hesitant as I usually have issues after day 2 to 3.  Well after a week of using all three product I am excited to say I can feel a huge difference in my skin hydration.  I have less wrinkles-cracks from the dryness.  I have used the products together and would say jump in!  They are great!  Not one issue with irritation and the softness of my skin is pretty remarkable.  My husband even noticed the difference!!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I liked it. It was a little oily but it did the job. I can&#x27;t say I would buy it again but I&#x27;ll use it til it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS HYALURONIC ACID SERUM FOR SEVERAL DAYS COUPLED WITH THEIR MOISTURE.  WHAT AN AMAZING DIFFERENCE THIS PRODUCT HAS MADE FOR ME.  FINE LINES HAVE DIMINISHED, CROWS FEET HAVE LESSENED, AND I ACTUALLY LOOK YOUNGER! I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.  THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I love love love this serum! It goes on so smoothly and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all! When I&#x27;m done using it and my face soaks all of it up my looks and feels so healthy and pretty! Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been not using a serum after all these years! Will definitaly buy again!! *i received this with a promotional discount*</li>
    <li> Great stuff, buy this you will love it!!</li>
    <li> This is a very luxurious serum all around. I really like the packaging because it&#x27;s very sleek looking and sturdy. It won&#x27;t fall over on a makeup tray or bathroom counter. The serum itself goes on really smooth and sinks in very quickly. There isn&#x27;t a strong smell that I notice so if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance this shouldn&#x27;t bother your skin. I have dry/sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction or irritation with this serum. It makes my skin look a lot more hydrated and more plump. When I use it at night the next morning my skin feels so soft and has a healthy glow. I like to use this on my neck and chest area too and I do notice that it firms my neck area. I think this is a great all around gently but effective anti-aging serum.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for review but all opinions and experiences are my own.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this serum and OMG I LOVE IT! I have fine lines on my forehead from frowning all the time and by my surprise this serum diminished my lines. ITS A GREAT INVESTMENT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks now and I love it It light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue behind.I am 35 but I looks  years younger.I just use it under a tinted sunscreen during the day. The Regenfx line has kept my skin looking even,bright and youthful</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin tone</li>
    <li> So far I love it. I have been using this product for about a year.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my mother and she loves it!! I can tell a significant difference!!</li>
    <li> Awesome texture, light scent, smooth finish, and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy in my 40 &#x27; s and this works and feels great. Not oily or greasy. Seeing improvements in about 2 weeks.  Will buy again. .But it&#x27;s usually cheaper on that &amp;#34;auction site&amp;#34; ;) that starts with a E. Good stuff though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and it definitely made my skin have a healthier appearance and glow. I still needed a moisturizer over it. I will review after a few more applications. I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate it at all.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for about a week now. My skin is definitely softer and smoother, and slowly seems to be getting clearer. Will have to continue my use longer to see if it continues to improve my skin, will update review.</li>
    <li> This face serum isn&#x27;t my favorite :(  I also purchased the eye serum and face lotion in this same line and loved them! They were wonderful, met my expectations plus. They made my face feel revived, fresh and youthful. However, this face serum left my face stiff! Maybe that&#x27;s how it gets rid of lines, it freezes them? I can see how it works, it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> This product is seriously amazing! I received it at a promotional price to test and I love the way it makes your face feel, even just after one use!</li>
    <li> i need more time to use this Serum, for more result .</li>
    <li> I received this for review and loved it it works great with RegenFX Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream and RegenFX Anti Aging Eye Treatment.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product! Goes on smoothly and seems to work against wrinkles</li>
    <li> I see results and look forward to seeing more</li>
    <li> I love that I can feel this product working yet it does not dry out my skin! After just a few weeks use I have noticed that my skin appears healthier and tighter. I have recommended this product to all of my girlfriends and it’s about time I left a review! Now that I know about this product and it’s amazing results, I simply refuse to go without!!</li>
    <li> Loved using it. Easy to use. Comes out easily. It is a very creamy lotion. Makes your skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> (I received this product for review purposes. My opinions are my own. For more information and pictures, please see my blog, Lit From Within.) I&#x27;ve tested a lot of Hyaluronic Acid serums, and my skin loves this ingredient.  It&#x27;s so important for aging skin!  As someone with oily skin, serums are so important to deliver nutrients and moisture without using heavy, rich creams that cause breakouts.  Old AND pimply is not cute.  I use this 2x a day, and my skin stays smoother and looks younger.  It&#x27;s also cruelty-free and made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Great customer service. Unfortunately, the product (and it is the only difference in regimen) makes my skin too flushed and feverish. I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin, so not sure what&#x27;s going on.</li>
    <li> its not as good as another brands i have tried.   the solution comes out clumpy sometimes and watery at other times.  im only still using it because its there.  i wouldnt buy this one again when there are so many others out there that are way better.  i have tried about 5 brands now and this is the bottom of the barrel.</li>
    <li> Its a really good product I recommend it! It helps with aging wrinkles. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and I see the results. A daily use would really improve wrinkles. Order yours now!</li>
    <li> Already seeing results after only a week. Excited to see the results after a few more weeks.</li>
