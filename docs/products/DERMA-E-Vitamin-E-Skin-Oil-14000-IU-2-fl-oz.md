<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GREAT ALSO DARK PATCHES, ALLEGEDLY, TRY IT</li>
    <li> I have tried using vitamin e capsules but this derma e oil is much thinner - lower viscosity than the capsules. So the oil is not much visible on your skin. Over a period of 3 weeks you can see considerable smoothness in the skin. This is a good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had seek customer service help with the shipment and they were very nice and helpful!</li>
    <li> Well I have been using this oil for the past two months and I love it. I mix it with pure unrefined pressed coconut oil and argan oil and voila! It feels luxurious even applying it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, great for problematic skin!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for 100% Vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;This has safflower oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;I guess 100% Vitamin E oil is no longer available.</li>
    <li> Works great on skin and nails.</li>
    <li> Used for making homemade lotion bars. Works great.</li>
    <li> I receive my bottle a week ago and it does wonders to my skin, my old aged spots gone&lt;br /&gt;my skin looks bright  then ever I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> After spending some time researching ways to keep my face smooth, supple, &amp; minimize lines without causing breakouts, I found that Vitamin E is an affordable and natural product to use.  Once I decided to use Vitamin E in my nightly routine I researched Vitamin E products. I then came across Derma E Vitamin E Skin Oil (14K I.U.). It was in my price range and it had excellent reviews so I decided to order it. I&#x27;m very happy that I did! I apply this Vitamin E almost every night before bed using a cotton ball and when I wake up in the morning my facial skin is so soft, fresh and young looking. Keep in mind, I&#x27;m almost 29, an age where you can still get breakouts but those fine lines start coming in. I would recommend this product to almost anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too watery for me but I am sure other people would love thay it&#x27;s not thick. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a really good vitamin E oil. Derma e is that. Safflower oil is the carrier, and this is great because it is light and dries quickly. I use it on my skin and nails. I also use their Skin, Hair, and Nail oil (argan, jojoba, kukui) [[ASIN:B00BGVM578 Derma E Skin Hair and Nail Oil, 1 Fluid Ounce]] on my hair. Excellent, pure products, no filler oils, fragrances, or funky ingredients. And unlike many oils on the market, Derma e&#x27;s always has an expiration date. Great family owned and operated company. I feel good buying this brand.</li>
    <li> Just received using for face cream...waiting on results. Will let you know as time passes. Hope it works. ;) GO</li>
    <li> Perfect for scrapes, cuts, etc.  I&#x27;ve noticed less scarring when I use this! Nice to have on hand for human or dog injuries.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it, I use it for my face, body, and hair. I use it most of the time on my face and my hair day and night and I will buy more as soon as this bottle is about to be finished :)</li>
    <li> I use this product to clear up bruises on my hands.  After a few applications over the bruise, the bruise&lt;br /&gt;disappears.  Because it requires only a thin coat on each use, a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It was open with no seal cant be aure whats inside, the oil is runny not thick, I applied it twice only</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin and I do a ton of research before buying anything that will go on my face and I thought for sure this would work great for me because safflower oil is non comedogenic.  After using this a few times I notice small tiny bumps all over my face (similar to hives) so its obvious my sensitive skin does not handle this particular oil well.  It seems great though and I&#x27;m sure it will work wonderfully for people without super sensitive skin like mine but it didn&#x27;t work good for me</li>
    <li> Just came yesterday...used it last nite and again this morning and my skin&lt;br /&gt;looks better than ever.  My husband is trying it to thicken his skin on hands&lt;br /&gt;because every bump releases blood into skin and it looks terrible.  We do not&lt;br /&gt;expect a miracle but if it lightens those purple makks that cover his entire hands,&lt;br /&gt;it would be terrific.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that we have used for years.  Quick delivery at an attractive price.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son who is using over some burns. Seems to be helping. Hope it continues to help out.</li>
    <li> My face suffers from discolorations and acne scars. After using this oil for a week I can see a noticeable difference! My skin is brighter and clearer. I had a hard time finding a light moisturizer for my face as it is very sensitive and this oil is God scent. A little goes a long way. I use it after each face wash.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Especially if you suffer from eczema.  My face tends to peel and this product leaves my face hydrated throught the day.</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own beauty items like lotion bars, cuticle balm, hair serum, beard oil, etc. I honestly can&#x27;t think of much to say about the product other than the fact that it&#x27;s exactly what I expected it to be and seems to be a fair value!</li>
    <li> I use it with coconut oil and other organic oils for my own face cream/moisturizer.  I love knowing I have good ingredients and saving money making my own.</li>
    <li> In my family stretch marks comes along when two things happen. Puberty and pregnancy. The women of my family all had them so when I found out I was pregnant I tracked down every lotion out there. This one kept popping up so I tried it. NO STRETCH MARKS! I&#x27;m no 3 months post pregnancy and my baby Penelope is also enjoying this on her tiny feet.</li>
    <li> I used to use a different kindof vitamin E oild. I like this one better. Been using for couple of days. The smell is pleasant. I have very dry skin on face, body and scalp. Using it for the whole body. Face feels soft. Can&#x27;t say if it made any difference is my scalp yet.</li>
    <li> Have been using this on a couple of dark scars, seems to be making them lighter.  Also, I use it around my eyes and on any fine lines.  Very pleased with results.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other Vita-E serums but they have been too thick to use facially--this one is easy to use on the face, and is all natural, as well as being a good value.</li>
    <li> I love the feels of the vitamin e oil. I have used it several times so far, in salves and lotions. Feels great.</li>
    <li> High Quality Vitamin E Oil</li>
    <li> Softens skin. Improves the appearance of nails and hair also. A little goes a long way and it does not leave that greasy/oily feel behind! Put a couple drops of your favorite essential oil in it and you have the perfect daily moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This brand is my choice always -- so tried the Vitamin E Skin Oil and am very pleased. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dry skin and It has been amazing.This is a mixture of Vitamin E oil and Safflower oil. I literally saw a difference within a day. Other people around me have noticed as well. My skin looks softer and has a nice glow to it. The dry patches on my skin have started to diminish as well. I usually use this on its own or mix it with another moisturizer.  One annoying factor was that it didn&#x27;t come with a pump! Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> I bought 5 bottles to my friends in Taiwan as a gift and they all like it very much.  nice~</li>
    <li> Love this oil and have been using it for many many years. It is the best I have ever found and is perfect for my extremely dry skin. I am always getting compliments on the skin on my face and this is what I use daily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after it was recommended in a demonstration for scalp and hair care on YouTube. I&#x27;ve used it on my scalp, hair, face (including lips, all around my eyes, and dry patches on eyebrows), and on a dry patch of skin I have on my arm and hand. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for less than 2 weeks and all areas have already improved in appearance and/or in how it feels. My hair is shiny but not oily feeling, my face is smoother and more plump/moist but not oily (and it does not promote acne), dry patches on my face are gone, and the dry patches on my hand and arm are much less noticeable. It did not irritate my eyes at all. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend, when using it, dip a Q-tip into the bottle, don&#x27;t touch your finger to the bottle opening. This will help keep it from getting bacteria in it.</li>
    <li> I am not really sure yet - I have only been using this for a week along with &amp;#34;Vitamin C serum for the face 20%&amp;#34; - I have had no adverse reactions so that is really a plus, does look oily for a couple of minutes until it dries and then completely goes away so you can easily wear it both in the day and night - I am using it both times, but the directions say one time of day is fine too.  I think it will work good once I give it time - I have read great things about using vitamin E and Vitamin C together on the face.</li>
    <li> got this for my dog who has itches &amp; the vet told me this would be perfect for the dry skin!!</li>
    <li> I must be honest and say that I haven&#x27;t use this oil consistently enough to know if it fades any type of dark marks. What I can say is that, I really love the texture of the oil and it feels really nice on my skin. It does leave my skin feeling soft and smooth. So for what I know so far and as much as I&#x27;ve used so far I think it&#x27;s really nice, feels great on my skin, and I will continue to use it</li>
    <li> Great for skin and hair!</li>
    <li> Really like this vitamin E. Added it to a face moisturizer I made and I am sure in a few weeks I will look 10 years younger😊. Received quickly and packed well.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It&#x27;s super hydrating without being greasy. There&#x27;s no bad scent or stickiness. I&#x27;ve got dry skin and use it morning and night, but I think if you&#x27;ve got combination or oily, you would only use it at night before bed. My skin looks clearer and there are no more dry patches. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Very good and pure oil. I use sparingly on my face over a moisturizer also rubbing elbows and knees. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great for hair and nails</li>
    <li> This stuff saved my skin. I had been using an expensive brand of face lotion that left me with HORRIBLE dry skin all over my face, not just patches but my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this on Friday, got it Monday, and put it on every night. After the first night, it was better but I still had spots that collected any makeup I applied. After the 3rd night, its the best it&#x27;s ever been in my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see one dry spot, even after a day of wearing heavy foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing it&#x27;s doing is starting to balance out my redness and oil on my face. I used to work really hard to get rid of all oil, but applying this every night, I don&#x27;t think my skin feels the need to over produce oil now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really loving this and so glad I bought it!!</li>
    <li> Seems to be good quality, will probably order again.</li>
    <li> This oil leaves my face hydrated and glowing. Perfect under makeup if you choose. I once thought applying oil would increase an oil problem.... not the case. Our skin produces extra oil when its dry, just like extra sweat when you use antiperspriant. Give your skin what it actually wants and be amazed at the balance that is restored!</li>
    <li> Sunburns clear up quickly when applied.</li>
    <li> Great product. It works well to help skin that is dry and makes it soft and supple. I use it at night over my retin a cream and during the day under my makeup. I love how healthy and plump my skin looks with makeup! Just a great natural alternative. I&#x27;ve also noticed an increase in my eyelashes since using it. Sometimes I apply a little on my lashes and the growth has been incredible. Amazing multipurpose product!</li>
    <li> I feel my face come smooth when use it</li>
    <li> A little heavy and sticky. I add it to my epsom salt for a nice hand and body scrub.</li>
    <li> The product arrive on time and looked as describe.</li>
    <li> Great product, loved it!</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I use it all over my body, mix with Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Love the oil!  It&#x27;s great on skin, especially for age spots and relieves dry lips.  Recommended by a foundation for an autoimmune disorder.</li>
    <li> Absolutely live this product.  Has really helped my dry skin!!</li>
    <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have only used this oil a couple times but so far, it hasn&#x27;t caused any allergic reactions or had any unpleasant side effects.  I have very sensitive skin so finding products that don&#x27;t make hives flare up or make my skin red and blotchy is a difficult task.  This oil is thick and kind of has a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling when being rubbed in.  It spreads nicely but requires a good amount of rubbing to be fully absorbed.  It has absolutely no smell that I can detect.  I also applied some to a scar on my husband&#x27;s arm last night.  I didn&#x27;t look at it this morning to see whether it helped any overnight but we&#x27;ll probably apply it again tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I am using this product in conjunction with Vit C Oil, Rosehip Oil, and Evening Primrose Oil for stretch marks and deep lines across my neck and collarbone area.  I have stretch marks from my second pregnancy and have used Strivectin SD for awhile but wanted to try something more holistic and natural...not to mention, cheaper!!  So far, my skin is very smooth and supple.  My stretch marks seem less prominent and my neck skin is nice and tight.  I intend to try these products with my dermaroller and will update my review with the results after awhile.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works for my sensitive skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night on developing stretchmarks during my pregnancy and it has faded their color pretty drastically. Obviously not a cure, but giving this paranoid momma to be a little bit of comfort!</li>
    <li> great vit e oil- has nice clean scent, use it daily and very satisfied with it</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade cosmetic products. It&#x27;s a good buy and a good product.</li>
    <li> It is quite diluted and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the derma e Vitamin E Skin Oil.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff.  I use it on small wounds to prevent scars, on bruising from eye surgery, neck for aging skin. And this is a great price.</li>
    <li> I had been using vitamin e oil forever before, well the first time I used this one it gave me a horrible allergy in my face. To the trash can it went, not buying it anymore.</li>
    <li> Product came at the last possible day, but happy with product so far.</li>
    <li> Glass bottle. Cheap. No smell. Spreads well.</li>
    <li> I was having laser hear removal on my legs, underarms and chin.  My skin is sensitive to the laser.  After the treatment I rub vitamen E all over the treated area.  This particular bottle of Vitamen E was pure and had no additives.  My skin was soft and supple after patting/rubbing in this oil.</li>
