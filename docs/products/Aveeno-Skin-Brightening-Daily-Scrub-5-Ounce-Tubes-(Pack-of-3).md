      <li>Quantity, quality, and price; 100% satisfied!</li>
      <li>This Aveeno cleanser is just ok.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely a satisfied customer</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love all the Aveeno skin care products and this is no exception.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Gentle on the skin but does an amazing job!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate and price is fantastic</li>
      <li>still enjoy using it, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily fair to describe it as a scrub, more than a slightly more intense daily cleanser.</li>
      <li>I do follow it with a good facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love how gentle this is and how you can see its work as soon as you rinse it off.</li>
      <li>this one makes my skin feel clean and fresh without residue on my face.</li>
      <li>Your service just keeps me coming back for more and more help from you while I am in Yap, Micronesia.  </li>
      <li>I use Aveeno&#x27;s Positively Brightening line of products and was looking for an exfoliating cleanser to add to the line for when I didn&#x27;t feel the cleansing pads weren&#x27;t doing a good enough job.  </li>
      <li>If you apply this in the morning and evening in small amounts (pea sized) this stuff works great.</li>
      <li>This is the right product adn delivery is always very fast.</li>
      <li>This is a nice facial wash, just not as much as a \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; as the name would lead you to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nobody does it half as good as you,</li>
      <li>Aveen PB cleansing pads get their exfoliating nature from the texture of the roughness of one side of pad and generally, it&#x27;s okay for daily use.  </li>
      <li>Just perfect light scrub for daily cleaning without irritating the skin.</li>
      <li>It feels like there&#x27;s a gentle grit to it, without it being drying at all, with the trademark Aveeno gentle, natural smell and clean rinse.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my face and neck in the shower daily and seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much Amazon for getting the Aveeno product to me in a timely manner.  </li>
      <li>Wife uses this alot and really likes it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t help too much with blemish control though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle -</li>
      <li>It smells good, the scrub isn&#x27;t too abrasive, and i&#x27;m not worried about it effecting my skin negatively.</li>
      <li>This scrub, while a little better, really isn&#x27;t that much of an improvement.  </li>
      <li>Though a lot of us like to feel real scrub action in our exfoliators, scraping off the skin</li>
      <li>Modern exfoliators are more gentle and a little more vague about what exactly makes them exfoliate, using terms like microbeads, whatever those</li>
      <li>It just never really rose to the level of what I&#x27;d consider a scrub, not even by today&#x27;s modern standard of a gentle, hydrating scrub that&#x27;s safe to use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and this keeps my skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t make it feel dry.</li>
      <li>After shopping around for a while and trying different products (jack black being the absolute worst…)</li>

    <li> This is the right product adn delivery is always very fast. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I like this product because of the less harsh EVERYTHING. It smells good, the scrub isn&#x27;t too abrasive, and i&#x27;m not worried about it effecting my skin negatively. It doesn&#x27;t help too much with blemish control though.</li>
    <li> I had a coupon so I got this when it was on sale. It&#x27;s gentle - that&#x27;s a plus. Though a lot of us like to feel real scrub action in our exfoliators, scraping off the skin w. abrasives isn&#x27;t always best for our face. It doesn&#x27;t break me out - that&#x27;s another plus. I have acne prone skin. But frankly I prefer the results I get from the [[ASIN:B0015S88Y6 Olay Daily Facials Deep Cleansing Cleansing Cloths - Combination/Oily 120 Cloths (6\\&quot; x 7.25\\&quot;)]]. This Aveeno cleanser is just ok. I keep it in my shower. I will use it 2-3xs a week to get that extra exfoliation. But I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again once I&#x27;m done w. the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance.  It does not irritate my skin and it&#x27;s pleasant to use.</li>

This is a nice facial wash, just not as much as a \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; as the name would lead you to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of your mother&#x27;s exfoliators (that would be me!) would be the awful apricot seed, chunky, pore scraping variety that would clean the pores, sure, but would also remove a layer of skin.  Modern exfoliators are more gentle and a little more vague about what exactly makes them exfoliate, using terms like microbeads, whatever those are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aveen PB cleansing pads get their exfoliating nature from the texture of the roughness of one side of pad and generally, it&#x27;s okay for daily use.

    <li> Thank you so much Amazon for getting the Aveeno product to me in a timely manner.  Your service just keeps me coming back for more and more help from you while I am in Yap, Micronesia.  I am absolutely a satisfied customer and I talk about you everywhere that I go including here in Yap, Micronesia.  Amazon.com please keep doing what you do...reminds me of a song: &amp;#34;Nobody does it better, I feel sad for the rest.  Nobody does it half as good as you, Amazon, you&#x27;re the BEST!&amp;#34;  Until the next order, &amp;#34;here&#x27;s lookin&#x27; at you kid.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love all the Aveeno skin care products and this is no exception. This product cleans my skin and doesn&#x27;t overdry it. I also like the fact that this manufacturer does not test on animals.</li>
    <li> Aveeno is a great product line.  This facial wash cleans without drying or clogging.  I do follow it with a good facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love it. Doesn&#x27;t irritate and price is fantastic</li>
    <li> This scrub is wonderful.  I have very dry skin and this keeps my skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t make it feel dry.</li>
    <li> I looked around quite a while for a decent facial cleanser that wasn&#x27;t going to over dry my skin, make it oily, or otherwise effect my face in a negative way. After shopping around for a while and trying different products (jack black being the absolute worst…) I tried this when a friend recommended it. If you apply this in the morning and evening in small amounts (pea sized) this stuff works great. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my very favorite products. Gentle on the skin but does an amazing job!</li>
    <li> Quantity, quality, and price; 100% satisfied!</li>
    <li> Wife uses this alot and really likes it.</li>
    <li> You know that feeling when the results on the commercials are the same you get after using the product??  I have had problem skin since middle school, trying everything (even the much more expensive Proactiv) and nothing as cleared up/improved my skin like this wash.  My routine also include the daily Brightening Lotion, and the Nighttime Intensive by Aveeno as well.  I got so my compliments!  Never turning back.</li>
    <li> not too harsh, and not too watery. Just perfect light scrub for daily cleaning without irritating the skin. I use it on my face and neck in the shower daily and seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> I am picky when it comes to cleansers. this one makes my skin feel clean and fresh without residue on my face. The smell is great as well.</li>
    <li> I love how gentle this is and how you can see its work as soon as you rinse it off.</li>
