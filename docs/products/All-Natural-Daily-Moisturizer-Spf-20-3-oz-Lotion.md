      <li>But rather than returning it, I use it on my lips, Tastes good and smells great.  </li>
      <li>spf&lt;br /&gt;- rated very safe by CosmeticsDatabase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out the sunscreens, lotions and lip balms on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of best sunscreens, lotions and lip balms and this one was pretty good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff has even helped my skin look more youthful!  </li>
      <li>The zinc literally stays on top of your skin and reflects everything as a good sunscreen should.  </li>
      <li>I give this product 5 stars because of its high quality organic ingredients, smell, and added bonus of making my skin look awesome!</li>
      <li>I am quite happy to say that this product passes my incredibly strict requirements for a daily sunscreen and moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>My face smelled like oranges - a nice scent but a bit too strong for my preference.  </li>
      <li>and it sure as heck didn&#x27;t protect as well.  </li>
      <li>As a guy finding a safe sunscreen was like finding a needle in a haystack.  </li>
      <li>Lets protect our skin! :)</li>
      <li>however, i think many people would dislike the thickness of this lotion.  </li>
      <li>just okay for my arms.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 31, and after a week of using this, my skin is softer, hydrated, and it has a healthy glow to it</li>
      <li>I tried this based on environmental working group&#x27;s report of safe effetive sunscreens.</li>
      <li>So I can get better protection.</li>
      <li>It rubbed in just fine though</li>
      <li>i use a powder foundation, so it&#x27;s fine, but i think liquid foundation might be a challenge.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the effect this 20 SPF moisturizer gives and it&#x27;s worth the try for anyone wanting a moisture barrier along with their SPF 20.  </li>
      <li>It felt comfortable throughout the day, but I didn&#x27;t reapply.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, that sensation subsided after a while.  </li>
      <li>I have to say I am very pleased to find a mineral based sunscreen moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have to create that ghastly white cast that deters most.</li>
      <li>and it blended well and was easily absorbed into my mature skin and turned out to be the perfect make-up primer for my natural water based liquid foundation(Benecos) that I was about to give up on!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy, and haven&#x27;t used many moisturizers in my day, but I can&#x27;t imagine anyone having a pleasant experience with this product unless your skin is super dry to begin with.</li>
      <li>I almost gave up until I tried True Naturals.  </li>
      <li>Looks like I&#x27;ll still be searching for a good chemical-free daily sunscreen...  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m loyal to any product that helps with the illusion.</li>
      <li>I like the idea of this product - an effective daily sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my twenties I would recommend this product for  more mature skin, or as a winter moisturizer .</li>
      <li>it does have many ingredients that naturally protect you from the sun like olive oil, jojoba oil, shea butter, coconut oil, and aloe.  </li>
      <li>I tossed the tube after that because it just wasn&#x27;t worth it to try to get used to it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how well this product would hold up if you were working outside all day, but for a moisturizer with SPF added, it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
      <li>It allowed the makeup to glide on as smooth as silk and my mature skin took on the dewy look of youth.</li>
      <li>Because others have noted it separates, I massaged the tube a bit to help make sure it&#x27;s mixed.</li>
      <li>and I was pleased overall with it.</li>
      <li>First</li>
      <li>If you have a picture taken of yourself with the flash on all you get back is a big bright flash where your face should be.  </li>
      <li>I will admit it is a bit thick and oily, however it does amazing things to my skin!</li>
      <li>Unusual, because my first tube separated into solids and oily liquid when dispersed.  </li>
      <li>the smell is fantastic, and i definitely feel better about putting something without toxic ingredients on my skin daily.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizer certainly is &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;..</li>
      <li>It is very greasy to the point that I feel and look like I&#x27;ve just rubbed butter on my face.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my face moisturize through out the whole day.</li>
      <li>However, it is very greasy and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Went straight in the trash.</li>
      <li>I have the most wonderfully soft skin the next morning.</li>
      <li>That didn&#x27;t do any good, as I opened the tube to give it another try and ended up with oil oozing out everywhere, making a big mess.  </li>
      <li>It is also a very emollient formula which leaves my dry skin soft and smooth all day.  </li>
      <li>Sunscreen must be safe for everyday use.    </li>
      <li>Washing it off was also a huge pain -- I had to scrub my face several times with soap since the beeswax and all the oils in this product are not soluble with a regular face cleanser.</li>
      <li>It does not come as easily as it claims on the back, I have to use a facial clanser to completely remove it when i&#x27;m no longer out in the sun.</li>
      <li>I really love this product, and even though it&#x27;s certainly not for everyone, it&#x27;s definitely the product for me.  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time, and is worth a try.</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion after searching for a moisturizer with sunscreen that was also natural.</li>
      <li>At the time I purchased it, I was charged nearly $22 for 3oz of this unusable moisturizer.</li>
      <li>There are many moisturizer/sunscreen combos claiming to be natural, but when you read the ingredients you find a few natural ingredients mixed in with a bunch of chemicals and preservatives.  </li>
      <li>I did not have store it anywhere near heat either.  </li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t anything about this in the description, so you think at most it&#x27;ll be as thick as a creme.</li>
      <li>The  product has maybe a little too much glycerin for my taste ,people gave me compliments on my &amp;#34; dewy look&amp;#34; but I felt like maybe it was a bit much,  </li>
      <li>The key is to only us a small amount, and I always &amp;#34;shake&amp;#34; it up before applying (really more squeezing and shaking the bottle to keep the oil and lotion mixed together).</li>
      <li>While it is organic free of harmful chemicals &amp; it also seems to last me the entire day I have a few complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>though it&#x27;s pretty sticky and leaves heavy residue on skin.</li>
      <li>I was surprised in this product that it was so thick when I tried it for the first time.</li>
      <li>A little goes a very long way, so it wins brownie points for bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>bottom line, this product is good for some skin types and bad for others.  </li>

<li> i&#x27;m not sure people with acne would be wanting to use something so thick and oily, but for people with extremely dry skin like me, it&#x27;s amazing and my skin feels so well moisturized all day long.    </li>
<li> it puts a very thick coat of lotion on your face, and it does not absorb quickly.  </li>
<li> but if you have dry skin and have concerns about white cast then this is the sunscreen for you.</li>
<li> And also i&#x27;m a bit skeptical when it comes to suing this product because it doesn&#x27;t say anything about not clogging the pores, and I also believe this product might have fragrance because it gives off this strong orange scent (and</li>
<li> /&gt;Shortly after using this product my cheeks became covered with these dry redish patches (an allergic reaction I assume).</li>
<li> I do have dry skin, but like others have commented, this stuff feels like I rubbed butter and honey all over my face.  </li>
<li> I have dry skin</li>
<li> However the thickness is a drawback because it leaves my skin (naturally a little dry but overall fairly normal) slick and oily for a while.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and by the end of the day my face is still sticky and goopy and it apparently &amp;#34;makes</li>
<li> I wanted to get some face moisturizer with minimal health hazards as rated by Environmental Working Group.  </li>
<li> So I spent hundreds of dollars and tested every sunscreen under the sun.  </li>
<li> Not sure how this one will work out for summer, might have to find something lighter, but for winter this seems satisfactory for the drying conditions and the inevitable dry flaky skin that follows,</li>
<li> As the other reviewer noted, it leaves quite a shine.  </li>
<li> I agree with the other people on this review thread.</li>
<li> also, if you don&#x27;t use anything to cover it up, your skin will look extremely shiny as it seems to be an oily product.  </li>
<li> Also decided due to safety concerns</li>
<li> It also appears to be separating as other people have said that it has done to them.</li>
<li> It will leave your skin &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;, which is why a small amount is key.</li>
<li> This is due to the beeswax I&#x27;m guessing that coats the skin.  </li>
<li> Then I switched to a chemical active sunscreen.  </li>
<li> My bottle may have been a little off-cause the consistency was weird-there was a separation of oil and lotion.</li>
<li> Just a little dewy but not the oil slick</li>
<li> It has lasted a long time because I can only use it for a few days at a time, then put it aside, then think maybe it wasn&#x27;t all that bad, then use again for a few days until I remember that I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
<li> I have used this sporadically over the past 4 months and would not recommend it.  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t feel too heavy (although it is a thick lotion) nor oily or sticky.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I like the idea of the product and not the actual product.  </li>
<li> me look sick.&amp;#34; It is also hard to put my mineral makeup on as the makeup does not want to spread over my face, it just sticks to the moisturizer.</li>
<li> went on thick, but soaked into the skin well</li>
<li> It is thick and sticky, too sticky for use on my face,</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s thick.</li>
<li> This product smells a bit like lemon, it&#x27;s quite thick, and its texture is sort of grainy.  </li>
<li> or if i didn&#x27;t like the feeling of a thick moisturizer on my skin all day.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i had previously been using a neutrogena product that got a terrible rating from the environmental working group so i decided to try this product.  the smell is fantastic, and i definitely feel better about putting something without toxic ingredients on my skin daily.  however, i think many people would dislike the thickness of this lotion.  if you wear a lot of makeup, this isn&#x27;t for you.  it puts a very thick coat of lotion on your face, and it does not absorb quickly.  i use a powder foundation, so it&#x27;s fine, but i think liquid foundation might be a challenge.  also, if you don&#x27;t use anything to cover it up, your skin will look extremely shiny as it seems to be an oily product.  i&#x27;m not sure people with acne would be wanting to use something so thick and oily, but for people with extremely dry skin like me, it&#x27;s amazing and my skin feels so well moisturized all day long.    bottom line, this product is good for some skin types and bad for others.  i&#x27;d be wary about it if i had acne or if i didn&#x27;t like the feeling of a thick moisturizer on my skin all day.  otherwise, it&#x27;s great and great for your skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out the sunscreens, lotions and lip balms on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of best sunscreens, lotions and lip balms and this one was pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on thick, but soaked into the skin well (there was no chalky white look). It felt comfortable throughout the day, but I didn&#x27;t reapply. It didn&#x27;t feel too heavy (although it is a thick lotion) nor oily or sticky.</li>
    <li> As a guy finding a safe sunscreen was like finding a needle in a haystack.  First the basics: 1. Sunscreen cannot contain chemical actives.  2. Sunscreen cannot leave a white cast on face.  3. Sunscreen must be moisturizing enough.  4. Sunscreen must be safe for everyday use.    I used to use a sunscreen with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.  I cannot count the number of times someone would come up to me and ask me if I was wearing makeup.  It just got too embarrassing.  I would wear the sunscreen off and on because of this.  Then I switched to a chemical active sunscreen.  Just didn&#x27;t like the way it felt on my skin and it sure as heck didn&#x27;t protect as well.  Also decided due to safety concerns I wanted nothing to do with chemical sunscreens.  So I spent hundreds of dollars and tested every sunscreen under the sun.  I started with mainstream brands and then tried all of the EWG recommended brands.  NONE of the mainstream brands came close to what I was looking for except for Yes To Carrots.  However, it contains nano-particle zinc as well as fragrance and Vitamin A.  All the rest either left white cast, weren&#x27;t moisturizing enough or both.      I then tried the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands.  To my dismay same thing.  Either too drying (didn&#x27;t realize how drying zinc oxide on your skin can be) or left white cast.  I almost gave up until I tried True Naturals.  This contains non-nano zinc (1000nm) and leaves absolutely no white cast.  I just don&#x27;t get how they do this but it works.  It is also a very emollient formula which leaves my dry skin soft and smooth all day.  As the other reviewer noted, it leaves quite a shine.  This is due to the beeswax I&#x27;m guessing that coats the skin.  The zinc literally stays on top of your skin and reflects everything as a good sunscreen should.  If you have a picture taken of yourself with the flash on all you get back is a big bright flash where your face should be.  I&#x27;ll take that as a sign the sunscreen is doing it&#x27;s job.  I&#x27;d rather be asked why my face is so oily than if I am wearing makeup.    You can&#x27;t have everything but if you have dry skin and have concerns about white cast then this is the sunscreen for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the rating it received from the Environmental Working Group with respect to product safety and efficacy.  Unfortunately, I like the idea of the product and not the actual product.  It is very greasy to the point that I feel and look like I&#x27;ve just rubbed butter on my face.  After a couple of weeks, the product has also separated so that there&#x27;s a gritty component and an oil component that squirt out of the tube.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> PROs&lt;br /&gt;- organic&lt;br /&gt;- spf&lt;br /&gt;- rated very safe by CosmeticsDatabase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;- nasty consistency&lt;br /&gt;- moisturizer arrives already separated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a lotion. It&#x27;s not even a creme. It&#x27;s a paste. Imagine trying to apply a paste to your face every morning! Yuck. Even if it hadn&#x27;t arrived already separated, the thickness would be the same. There wasn&#x27;t anything about this in the description, so you think at most it&#x27;ll be as thick as a creme. At the time I purchased it, I was charged nearly $22 for 3oz of this unusable moisturizer. Considering the totally non-standard consistency and lack of information about that in the description, I returned it.</li>
    <li> Unusual, because my first tube separated into solids and oily liquid when dispersed.  Yuck! Not a good beginning...but then I used it anyway and it blended well and was easily absorbed into my mature skin and turned out to be the perfect make-up primer for my natural water based liquid foundation(Benecos) that I was about to give up on!  It allowed the makeup to glide on as smooth as silk and my mature skin took on the dewy look of youth. I LOVE the effect this 20 SPF moisturizer gives and it&#x27;s worth the try for anyone wanting a moisture barrier along with their SPF 20.  I&#x27;ve been told I look 20 years younger than my age and I&#x27;m loyal to any product that helps with the illusion.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer certainly is &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;.. though it&#x27;s pretty sticky and leaves heavy residue on skin. I like to use it on my legs when I&#x27;m out in the sunshine. My bottle may have been a little off-cause the consistency was weird-there was a separation of oil and lotion. It rubbed in just fine though and I was pleased overall with it. Again, it&#x27;s quite oily.. doesn&#x27;t soak/sink in like a regular lotion. I appreciate how clean/natural non-harmful the product is though!</li>
    <li> The  product has maybe a little too much glycerin for my taste ,people gave me compliments on my &amp;#34; dewy look&amp;#34; but I felt like maybe it was a bit much,  I&#x27;m in my twenties I would recommend this product for  more mature skin, or as a winter moisturizer .</li>
    <li> I have dry skin so I apply it ten minutes before foundation. So I can get better protection. Then apply my foundation. Works every time. It keeps my face moisturize through out the whole day. I really enjoy. I had to give a review this stuff is awesome. I would definitely recommend. Lets protect our skin! :)</li>
    <li> I was surprised in this product that it was so thick when I tried it for the first time. A little goes a very long way, so it wins brownie points for bang for your buck. However the thickness is a drawback because it leaves my skin (naturally a little dry but overall fairly normal) slick and oily for a while. If I put it on at night and let it soak in ( or let my pillow rub it off) I have the most wonderfully soft skin the next morning. Just a little dewy but not the oil slick it was 8 hours prior. I have to say I am very pleased to find a mineral based sunscreen moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have to create that ghastly white cast that deters most. Not sure how this one will work out for summer, might have to find something lighter, but for winter this seems satisfactory for the drying conditions and the inevitable dry flaky skin that follows,</li>
    <li> I too ordered this product because of its safety rating from the EWG. The texture was like grainy Vaseline. Washing it off was also a huge pain -- I had to scrub my face several times with soap since the beeswax and all the oils in this product are not soluble with a regular face cleanser. In short, it was horrible. Went straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> Goes on greasy and stays greasy for hours afterwards. I&#x27;m a guy, and haven&#x27;t used many moisturizers in my day, but I can&#x27;t imagine anyone having a pleasant experience with this product unless your skin is super dry to begin with. Also leaves an unattractive sheen that had everybody at work asking me if I was sweating. Not a good thing.</li>
    <li> While it is organic free of harmful chemicals &amp; it also seems to last me the entire day I have a few complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after using this product my cheeks became covered with these dry redish patches (an allergic reaction I assume). It does not come as easily as it claims on the back, I have to use a facial clanser to completely remove it when i&#x27;m no longer out in the sun. And also i&#x27;m a bit skeptical when it comes to suing this product because it doesn&#x27;t say anything about not clogging the pores, and I also believe this product might have fragrance because it gives off this strong orange scent (and fragrance isn&#x27;t necessarily organic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I may continue to use this moisturizer but may just use my organic sunscreen on my face instead.</li>
    <li> I tried this based on environmental working group&#x27;s report of safe effetive sunscreens. Did it get the rating because you don&#x27;&#x27;t absorb it?  Incredibly thick greasy and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I have used this sporadically over the past 4 months and would not recommend it.  It is thick and sticky, too sticky for use on my face, just okay for my arms.  It has lasted a long time because I can only use it for a few days at a time, then put it aside, then think maybe it wasn&#x27;t all that bad, then use again for a few days until I remember that I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other people on this review thread. The product is very thick and does not rub into your skin, I&#x27;m assuming because of the sunscreen component. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and by the end of the day my face is still sticky and goopy and it apparently &amp;#34;makes me look sick.&amp;#34; It is also hard to put my mineral makeup on as the makeup does not want to spread over my face, it just sticks to the moisturizer. It also appears to be separating as other people have said that it has done to them.</li>
    <li> Product separates into oil and zinc oxide and will not remix so if you just get the  oil portion you have no sunscreen properties. I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> This product reminds me of Vaseline with SPF. I do feel like it is moisterizing but it&#x27;s thick. I got it b/c of the UV protection but the way it applies is something I would sleep in. I have used it twice and am debating on returning it.</li>
    <li> This was rated well by ewe.org/skindeep.  However, it is very greasy and shiny.  Has sun block!  But rather than returning it, I use it on my lips, Tastes good and smells great.  Who would figure...</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this product - an effective daily sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals.  However, this one misses the mark for me.  I do have dry skin, but like others have commented, this stuff feels like I rubbed butter and honey all over my face.  It stays sticky!  Because others have noted it separates, I massaged the tube a bit to help make sure it&#x27;s mixed. That didn&#x27;t do any good, as I opened the tube to give it another try and ended up with oil oozing out everywhere, making a big mess.  And this was days after I received it from Amazon.  I did not have store it anywhere near heat either.  Looks like I&#x27;ll still be searching for a good chemical-free daily sunscreen...  Sigh.</li>
    <li> There are many moisturizer/sunscreen combos claiming to be natural, but when you read the ingredients you find a few natural ingredients mixed in with a bunch of chemicals and preservatives.  I am quite happy to say that this product passes my incredibly strict requirements for a daily sunscreen and moisturizer.  Although not a vegan product (it does have beeswax) it does have many ingredients that naturally protect you from the sun like olive oil, jojoba oil, shea butter, coconut oil, and aloe.  This product smells a bit like lemon, it&#x27;s quite thick, and its texture is sort of grainy.  It does not soak into your skin all the way, and you can definitely tell you are wearing a moisturizer, but since there is no zinc oxide or titanium dioxide you don&#x27;t have to worry about any white residue.  I&#x27;m not sure how well this product would hold up if you were working outside all day, but for a moisturizer with SPF added, it&#x27;s awesome.  I really love this product, and even though it&#x27;s certainly not for everyone, it&#x27;s definitely the product for me.  This stuff has even helped my skin look more youthful!  I&#x27;m 31, and after a week of using this, my skin is softer, hydrated, and it has a healthy glow to it I haven&#x27;t seen in several years.  I give this product 5 stars because of its high quality organic ingredients, smell, and added bonus of making my skin look awesome!</li>
    <li> I wanted to get some face moisturizer with minimal health hazards as rated by Environmental Working Group.  This was one of the ones I tried.  After I applied it, my face was shiny and sticky/greasy feeling.  My face smelled like oranges - a nice scent but a bit too strong for my preference.  About 20 minutes after applying it, my face started to burn.  Fortunately, that sensation subsided after a while.  I was afraid to try it again for a couple weeks, but then thought it might just take some getting used to.  I tried it again about a month later and had the same experience.  I tossed the tube after that because it just wasn&#x27;t worth it to try to get used to it.  Unfortunately it ended up being a waste of $ for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion after searching for a moisturizer with sunscreen that was also natural. I will admit it is a bit thick and oily, however it does amazing things to my skin! I tried a couple of others, but kept coming back to this one. The key is to only us a small amount, and I always &amp;#34;shake&amp;#34; it up before applying (really more squeezing and shaking the bottle to keep the oil and lotion mixed together). It will leave your skin &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;, which is why a small amount is key. It does work under makeup,however I use a tinted moisturizer with spf when I wear makeup (physicians formula) and this one in the evening, weekends, and non make up days. It lasts a long time, and is worth a try.</li>
