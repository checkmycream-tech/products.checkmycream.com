      <li>I have the Sigmax brushes and fell in love with using them</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>the reason why I&#x27;m so excited to have the P86 to play with!</li>
      <li>... wash really easy.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really soft and apply my make up so nicely!</li>
      <li>they are easy to handle and so easy to clean as well.</li>
      <li>i really enjoy all my sigma brushes, i have been buying them for almost a year already</li>
      <li>Overall great product.</li>
      <li>These brushes are fantastic for using with liquid or cream based products as they are synthetic so do not absorb the product.</li>
      <li>Great length and size of the actual handles of the brushes.</li>
      <li>Small and perfect fit girl</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get these brushes and could not wait for my order to come.</li>
      <li>They are unique and I recommend them for anyone who loves make-up.</li>
      <li>Not disappointed with this purchase.</li>
      <li>These brushes are unique, and a necessity.</li>
      <li>I played with them as soon as they came out the package, I was sooo excited...</li>
      <li>Well worth the $49 price tag!</li>
      <li>honest speaking, I am in love with this product and will try all the products related to sigma brands.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the flat top kabuki!</li>
      <li>I bought these after purchasing the large angled synthetic brush which I love to apply my foundation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experienced a lot of shedding and they don&#x27;t seem as dense as I expected them to be.</li>
      <li>They seem better made than the drug store brushes, but not by much.</li>
      <li>The P82 and the P86 brushes are also fun and very useful.</li>
      <li>Especially the cream and fluid products are perfect ot apply with these  brushes.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and they&#x27;re such great quality.</li>
      <li>I have the F80, F82, and F84 when it first came out as a set, unfortunately I do not have the F86 yet but more</li>
      <li>The F86 was not available when I received my Sigmax set, but the P86 is a tapered brush that works great for applying my under eye concealer, which is exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
      <li>The synthetic brushes apply concealer as well as foundation to smaller, hard to reach areas very easily and flawlessly!</li>
      <li>The brushes were fine, however they were too large for my gf to use.  </li>
      <li>GREAT FLUFFY BRUSH.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT</li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying these</li>
      <li>Decided to go for a set of four instead of just paying for one brush as it&#x27;s worth buying a set.</li>
      <li>and I saw the familiar eye-shadow shapes (with the addition of a flat-top -- which is really the reason I bought the set ... wanted to play with that shape).</li>
      <li>Amazing quality, soft bristles, comparable to high end brands</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Received these early, and I am very impressed. The packaging is great, the brushes are great, and I love the holographic imagery on the handles and that the handles are made of plastic, not wood (so no worries about cracking when wet). Overall great product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these brushes. They are very soft and it is perfect to apply Highlighter, Concealers...even I use it for contouring. Especially the cream and fluid products are perfect ot apply with these  brushes. The shipping was very fast from the US to Germany and I can absolutely recommend these products. I love SIGMA brushes ....good quality for a good price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. The results of this precision kit is amazing. I have been using with my customers and the results of the photos are impressive. Look like the skin has no make up. I am really happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have wanted the precision kit for soo long! I have the F80, F82, and F84 when it first came out as a set, unfortunately I do not have the F86 yet but more the reason why I&#x27;m so excited to have the P86 to play with! I&#x27;ve only washed them so far and have yet to use them but I liked the big version so much I don&#x27;t see why I wouldn&#x27;t like this kit!</li>
    <li> A perfect set. Love them</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they were eye-shadow sized. I read the write-up and saw they were &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; brushes. But then I looked at the picture and I saw the familiar eye-shadow shapes (with the addition of a flat-top -- which is really the reason I bought the set ... wanted to play with that shape). THen I got them and they are about twice the size of eyeshadow brushes. I almost sent them back and then I started to play with them ... YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them for applying base colors on my eyes as well as fine detail work on my face. They are high-quality... really soft without being whimpy ... don&#x27;t shed at all ... wash really easy. And the best thing of all, I&#x27;ve never played with brushes this size before. They pick-up and apply liquids, creams &amp; mineral powders equally well. The only small thing I will say is they do use a lot more powder eye-shadow product than a smaller brush, for obvious reasons because they are bigger brushes. But they don&#x27;t fling it around your face like a cheaper brush would. They are unique and I recommend them for anyone who loves make-up. They will last and it&#x27;s been really fun to invent new ways to use them.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes today and I absolutely love them! I played with them as soon as they came out the package, I was sooo excited...My favourite is the angled which is just perfect for my undereye concealer application! They are so soft and gentle under the eyes, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it pulling my \\&quot;aging\\&quot; skin. I own over 15 sigma brushes excluding these and since I&#x27;ve had them I have not touched my MAC brushes....I absolutely love sigma brushes! Well worth the $49 price tag!</li>
    <li> I totally love Thea brushes they work well for all types of makeup, liquid powder, creams etc. Very good for Blending &amp; also really good for buffing the products into the skin to get a Flawless finish, I am in love with these Brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought these after purchasing the large angled synthetic brush which I love to apply my foundation. These brushes are fantastic for using with liquid or cream based products as they are synthetic so do not absorb the product. These apply and blend concealer perfectly in small areas such as around the nose/under eye areas and giving a natural polished finish. I have also used with eye primers and MAC paintpots which they work equally well for. Definitely worth buying these and they are great value for money.</li>
    <li> The brushes were fine, however they were too large for my gf to use.  She was expecting something smaller in size.</li>
    <li> I use the tapered brush in the attached video - it is amazing for getting into the corners of your eyes to deal with dark areas there!    [...]</li>
    <li> Sigma never lets me down. I have the Sigmax brushes and fell in love with using them (even thought I don&#x27;t always wear foundation) I LOVE the flat top kabuki! When the Precision kit came out I knew that I&#x27;d love them too. It was exactly what I needed to apply my concealer. The synthetic brushes apply concealer as well as foundation to smaller, hard to reach areas very easily and flawlessly! As soon as I received my order I played with them and applied makeup. The P80 (flat) works well to blend my concealer in the trouble areas I&#x27;m trying to cover. The P82 and the P86 brushes are also fun and very useful. The P82 works great for my eye primer or base. The F86 was not available when I received my Sigmax set, but the P86 is a tapered brush that works great for applying my under eye concealer, which is exactly what I was looking for!! I LOVE SIGMA!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get these brushes and could not wait for my order to come. It was my Christmas present to myself this year. I use both the precision flat (P80) and the precision tapered (P86) for concealer. P86 is for the cream/liquid concealer, and then the P80 for putting setting powder on top of that. I use the precision round (P82) for my eye shadow primers and have searched high and low for a brush to do this for me! It&#x27;s perfect. It applies so luxuriously. It does exactly what I wanted it to, which makes me really happy! The precision angled (P84) is what I use for my highlighters. I use a powder form of highlighter on the top of my cheek bones, on my brow bone and a swipe down my nose. I really like how this applies and had been looking for a brush to do this job too. I don&#x27;t like getting products that are sparkly on my fingers, it just seems much more messy than necessarily so I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase! These are my first Sigma brushes and from this order I know I definitely want to try more brushes by them. They&#x27;re really soft and apply my make up so nicely!</li>
    <li> The Sigma Beauty Synthetic Precision Brush Kit is everything I want from a high-end brush kit.  I took one star off because I had ordered this kit anticipating much smaller brushes, and was disappointed that they were so large - in between the usual eye brush and face brush sizes.  But, once I started experimenting with them, they quickly became part of my daily make-up application and an integral part of my kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are soft yet firm, sturdy, and a breeze to keep clean and sanitized.  They reach places where face brushes are too big and clumsy to work well, while eye brushes are too small to work quickly.  They definitely fill a gap I didn&#x27;t realize needed filling until I began using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Synthetic Precision Kit - just be aware of the \\&quot;in between\\&quot; size - and be aware that that size really does fill a gap.  You&#x27;ll be reaching for this kit again and again and again!</li>
    <li> I saw quite of a few of my favorite YouTube beauty gurus either using or talking about these brushes, and as a lover of Sigma brushes, I had to get the whole kit! I just got them yesterday, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to go home and try them. Each one can be used in so many different ways! I managed to try out each of the brushes this morning while applying my makeup and I must say, I am very excited about these! I would suggest these to anyone who loves makeup brushes!</li>
    <li> i love the sigma brushes. they are great and wonderful to use. they are easy to handle and so easy to clean as well. i have the face bruches of this set and had to get this set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of these kits as gifts and finally ordered one for myself. I LOVE them! The brushes are SO soft and help in blending SO well.</li>
    <li> these brushes are the bomb</li>
    <li> These brushes are the perfect size.  Very light in your hand, and they blend wonderfully, as well as highlight very well.  I may be using these exclusively from now.  These are my first sigma purchase, and I am so happy with it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without!! So functional. Can be used fur eyes, face, shadowing or foundationing. Small and perfect fit girl any corner of my face.</li>
    <li> honest speaking, I am in love with this product and will try all the products related to sigma brands. Love it.</li>
    <li> WHATS NOT TO LOVE ABOUT AUTHENTIC SIGMA BRUSHES.&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE SOFT YET, FIRM.&lt;br /&gt;THEY WORK JUST AS ADVERTIZED&lt;br /&gt;I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AS WELL</li>
    <li> Amazing quality, soft bristles, comparable to high end brands</li>
    <li> I love it. Definitely love these brushes. they are so multipurpose. Best brushes for concealer contour even eyeshadow!!! Will recommend.</li>
    <li> very happy to enjoy my brushes are of excellent quality and help me get a better precision in the makeup I hope to have the entire collection of brushes i loved....</li>
    <li> GREAT FLUFFY BRUSH. NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT SO FAR WITH SIGMA. LOOKING FORWARD TO BUYING MORE BRUSHES FROM YOU. AND PACKAGING WAS GREAT</li>
    <li> These brushes are the backbone for every eye look you could want. The wash up nice and hold their shape.</li>
    <li> I love love love this set!! I dont know how i ever lived with out them ... Get this set!</li>
    <li> Loved these brushes as soon as I opened the box. Very professional looking and had the plastic sleeves to protect the tips. Great length and size of the actual handles of the brushes. Recommend these brushes to anyone who is contemplating adding to their collection or even a first set. I use these for concealing underneath my eyes and areas on my face. Decided to go for a set of four instead of just paying for one brush as it&#x27;s worth buying a set. Not disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> i really enjoy all my sigma brushes, i have been buying them for almost a year already and i have nothing negative to say. i enjoy doing my makeup with these professional brushes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. Shipping was fast and they&#x27;re such great quality.</li>
    <li> My wife was very happy with these.  I had to watch a lot of youtube to make sure I got a good brand and these didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of these brushes. I reach for these brushes every day to apply concealer effortlessly and have also used them to apply eyeshadow base as well as pigments. The quality of these brushes is outstanding!!  Since I frequently purchase brushed from the Sigma site as well as from this vendor on Amazon &amp;#34;Etaliz&amp;#34;I can assure you that these brushes  are genuine!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are unique, and a necessity. I use the pointed one to blend concealor into the inner corner of my eyes, the rounded one for under eye concealor, the slanted one to set under eye powder, and the flat to cover facial blemishes. Allows you to use minimum product for maximum coverage and blends to a flawless finish.  Essential for everyone, especially those with more mature skin who are trying to use minimal product to avoid it settling into fine lines.  Love love love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes!! The brushes were bigger than I expected but guess that makes for better handling. They feel like they will last and hairs won&#x27;t fall out! Yay!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!  They are densly packed and do not shed even after multiple washes.  Great for applying cream, liquid and powder products in those hard to reach and eye areas.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> My brushes were shipped the day after I ordered them and I received them before the expected delivery date! They look exactly as pictured and are better than I expected. They&#x27;re really soft and sturdy! Sigma has stepped up their game since I ordered from them when the company first started. I have already washed the brushes and there was no shedding, loss of shape, any leakage of dye or anything like that. I&#x27;m definitely ordering more brushes later!</li>
    <li> The precision round brush is amazing for concealing and so soft! The precision tapered brush works well for blending eyeshadow or for crease colour. Would recommend this set!</li>
    <li> sigma has the best brushes seriously and I love that these are the smaller versions of the larger ones. I use these for contouring and they work great. They work well for anything very impressed.</li>
    <li> These are a good quality brushes and do its job as it tends to do.. Its kind of pricy but its ok for the quality you get</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely perfection! They blend out products nicely, I am in love with these brushes.  These are a must have item.</li>
    <li> I never purchased Sigma brushes before and the seller I purchased from is listed on Sigmas website as an authorized seller.... but, IDK, these brushes seem to be defective maybe? I&#x27;ve experienced a lot of shedding and they don&#x27;t seem as dense as I expected them to be. They seem better made than the drug store brushes, but not by much. Disappointed since so many reviews say these are amazing brushes. I just don&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> Sigma has been my favorite brand in brushes, all the brushes that I have are amazing and this ones I am just in love, I couldn&#x27;t ask more :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the material is great and the way they work I don&#x27;t have words to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks sigma for your amazing products</li>
    <li> Great price for an awesome product!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. The reason that I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a little dirty when I received it in the mail. Look like it has been used.</li>
    <li> Sigma is a cheap with high end results. You can&#x27;t go wrong with any of their brushes.</li>
