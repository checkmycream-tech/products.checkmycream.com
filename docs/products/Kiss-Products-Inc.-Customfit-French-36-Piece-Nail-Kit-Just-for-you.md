      <li>This is an easy to use product.</li>
      <li>Mine worked for me just fine except one would pop off every now and</li>
      <li>I like how they fit.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I think I actually like them better than the kind I use to wear.</li>
      <li>I wore these nails the whole time working at my last job (3yrs) and did a lot with my hands (working with money, cleaning, making food, etc) and these nails always stayed on GOOD!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s JUST as good as a really good super glue if not better!</li>
      <li>But the cost has increased sooo much I will not be able to continue buy thisproduct from you.</li>
      <li>Was very pleased with the product and the quick delivery of same.....</li>
      <li>The most natural looking nails they made.</li>
      <li>The glue that is included offers a strong bond.</li>
      <li>but this product just looks old and used before the customer even gets a chance to enjoy the product.</li>
      <li>A lot of people even thought they were my real nails!</li>
      <li>I purchased the nails and work pretty much like</li>
      <li>The nails provide an easy quick style for a night out or any other event where you don&#x27;t have time to sit in a nail salon.</li>
      <li>Warning all of those who are thinking to buy this not to it is a waste of money for sure!</li>
      <li>I always wore the medium length custom fit french manicure nails, but filed them shorter.</li>
      <li>This time I bought the everlasting french manicure short nails with tabs because I couldn&#x27;t find the kind I use to wear.</li>
      <li>I used kiss nail products in the past and always had AMAZING results with them</li>
      <li>these really do fit hard to fit nails.</li>
      <li>I actually use the glue for MANY different things at home that break!</li>
      <li>I love the variety of nails that come in the package (i.e., there are multiple thumb sizes) since not all fingers are created the same shape and size.</li>
      <li>But after I put them on, they REALLY look like I professionally french-manicured nails!</li>
      <li>like this particular style for couple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;The nail_bed is longer then other medium length nails, which makes your nails look more natural and slim.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased one separately with high reviews</li>
      <li>I am just one of those kinds of people who is kind of hard on the nails.</li>
      <li>half moons give even more natural look to those nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I think they did something differentely to the everlasting french nails now because they look different and the box says chip free guaranteed.</li>
      <li>I tried the everlasting french years ago and the white chipped almost right away!</li>
      <li>Glue was old so it became brittle and nails did not stay on.  </li>
      <li>I received an old package that looked like it had been returned.  </li>
      <li>Great product, unfortunately has been discontinued (story of my life!)</li>
      <li>use 5 second nail glue which works faster and better, so I am not sure about what is supplied in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Glue is not good, otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>it usually only take me ten minutes to apply and be ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I have found a few boxes that arrived earlier than promised.  </li>
      <li>The quality is much better then other brands.&lt;br /&gt;There are no chips and breaks while typing or doing dishes, or any other daily chores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love these false nails.</li>
      <li>Did not fit right at all.</li>
      <li>I love this particular style because they look very real but very disappointed because I bought them for an important event and had nothing but trouble.</li>

<li> and it sucks!!</li>
<li> Dirty and the opening was taped shut.  </li>
<li> The nails were also off color (ugly tan that didn&#x27;t match my skin tone &amp; very fake looking).</li>

    <li> I love these nails! The are by far the best kiss makes. Not sure why they were discontinued. The most natural looking nails they made. I always get so many compliments on my nails. Wish I could still find them in stores, they were half the price then on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Did not fit right at all. They did not look good on at all. they look cheap and the quality are very cheap. Don&#x27;t get it! But on the bright side, the people who sold them were very fast and great to work with.</li>
    <li> The product is great. I have been using it for years. But the cost has increased sooo much I will not be able to continue buy thisproduct from you.</li>
    <li> these really do fit hard to fit nails. The glue lasts a long time</li>
    <li> No better product around. (Instead of using the enclosed cyanoacrylate glue, I wear them with adhesive tabs. Much better for my nails!)</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> Glue was old so it became brittle and nails did not stay on.  I love this particular style because they look very real but very disappointed because I bought them for an important event and had nothing but trouble.</li>
    <li> These are tougher than most.  I like how they fit.</li>
    <li> Fortunately, I have found a few boxes that arrived earlier than promised.  Hopefully, I will be able to&lt;br /&gt;order more before they&#x27;re all gone.</li>
    <li> love these nails but wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive</li>
    <li> THESE ARE AWFUL! MADE FOR 2ND GRADERS</li>
    <li> I have been using Kiss Nails for many many years. The quality is much better then other brands.&lt;br /&gt;There are no chips and breaks while typing or doing dishes, or any other daily chores.&lt;br /&gt;I like this particular style for couple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;The nail_bed is longer then other medium length nails, which makes your nails look more natural and slim.&lt;br /&gt;The half moons give even more natural look to those nails.&lt;br /&gt;The french white part is thinner which gives the classy and delicate look to your nails and hands.&lt;br /&gt;I use 5 second nail glue which works faster and better, so I am not sure about what is supplied in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope Kiss does not discontinue this product like they did with LONG LENGTH nails that are nearly impossible to find now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To seller: keep those in stock, I just ordered another 6 boxes and will keep buying especially with 1/2 price compared to pharmacies.</li>
    <li> I received an old package that looked like it had been returned.  Dirty and the opening was taped shut.  Gross!!!</li>
    <li> Too bad they&#x27;re all discontinued.... :-(</li>
    <li> Great product, unfortunately has been discontinued (story of my life!)</li>
    <li> no problems same as you would buy at the store</li>
    <li> I thought it was easier to get this product online than trying to find it in the stores. However when I got this product the glue was already harden before I even opened it to use it! The nails were also off color (ugly tan that didn&#x27;t match my skin tone &amp; very fake looking). I used kiss nail products in the past and always had AMAZING results with them but this product just looks old and used before the customer even gets a chance to enjoy the product. Warning all of those who are thinking to buy this not to it is a waste of money for sure!</li>
    <li> I purchased the nails and work pretty much like other reviews say.  Mine worked for me just fine except one would pop off every now and then but that was easily replaceable with another nail and glue. I am just one of those kinds of people who is kind of hard on the nails.</li>
    <li> Nails look nice, but the glue does not withstand time.  Next time, I will buy the glue separately.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with the product and the quick delivery of same.....</li>
    <li> They are good.  The glue that came with it I could hardly get it out.  When it did, the nails started falling off so I had to use other glue that I have.  They are chipping already and they haven&#x27;t been on that long.  Not professional looking.</li>
    <li> reorder.... says its all. thank you</li>
    <li> I love these false nails. They are easy to apply and look great for over a week.  I always get compliments on my nails and it usually only take me ten minutes to apply and be ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always recommend this product to family and friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these nails for about 7 years now! I feel these are the BEST nails you can buy! I&#x27;ve NEVER had one break or even fall off and I use my hands a lot! They don&#x27;t come off till I take them off and that&#x27;s after 2 weeks of wearing them! I wore these nails the whole time working at my last job (3yrs) and did a lot with my hands (working with money, cleaning, making food, etc) and these nails always stayed on GOOD! I&#x27;ve got SO many compliments from customers wearing these and even from men! Everyone thought I got them done in a salon and where shocked to hear I did them myself!! A lot of people even thought they were my real nails! The glue they come with is AWESOME!! I actually use the glue for MANY different things at home that break! It&#x27;s JUST as good as a really good super glue if not better! I always wore the medium length custom fit french manicure nails, but filed them shorter. I took a break from these for a while and just started wearing them again the other day. This time I bought the everlasting french manicure short nails with tabs because I couldn&#x27;t find the kind I use to wear. It seems like the everlasting nails are all they make now. I tried the everlasting french years ago and the white chipped almost right away! But I think they did something differentely to the everlasting french nails now because they look different and the box says chip free guaranteed. So far so good and no chips! I think I actually like them better than the kind I use to wear. I don&#x27;t have to file them shorter which saves on time and they do look better. I guess I&#x27;ll see if over time they&#x27;ll chip or not. But if your thinking of buying these, just buy them! They&#x27;re worth every penny! And you could just buy them from walmart (like I do), rite aid, cvs, and probably target instead of ordering them on here. *Great product:)*</li>
    <li> First off, I have to say that I was a little skeptical when I first saw the nails. They seemed a little flimsy. But after I put them on, they REALLY look like I professionally french-manicured nails! I love the variety of nails that come in the package (i.e., there are multiple thumb sizes) since not all fingers are created the same shape and size. A con would be the glue - I couldn&#x27;t even get it to open, but I&#x27;m not counting that against my rating fro the nails. Beautiful, classy and durable. I will definetely order them again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can anybody tell me what&#x27;s a good nail glue? I purchased one separately with high reviews and it sucks!!</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use product. The tips go on so well my friends didn&#x27;t believe I did them myself. The glue that is included offers a strong bond. The nails provide an easy quick style for a night out or any other event where you don&#x27;t have time to sit in a nail salon. I often have a hard time finding nails wide enough for my thumb but Kiss has a variety of sizes and this kit has 36 nails so I even have nails to spare. I love this product.</li>
    <li> They where to big and the glue came in a block and wouldn&#x27;t come out from the tube</li>
    <li> These nails were great exactly what the pictures showed they came in the box with glue included. I will defently be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Glue is not good, otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
