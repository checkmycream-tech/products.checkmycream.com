    <li> Excelent Product and service.</li>
    <li> priced right and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard and sensitive skin.  I use this in the shower, get a close shave and no skin issues.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, excellent shaver accessories and foils, Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Nice to have a good shave again.  This razor takes some time to get the shave done though.</li>
    <li> Met expectations, very close to the original. Removal and replacement of both cutter blades was very delicate to handle. nice</li>
    <li> Works as promised to prolong life of razor. Costing only a fraction of the cost of the razor is costly!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!! It&#x27;s such an easy close shave that he doesn&#x27;t mind shaving.  It&#x27;s easy to use too!</li>
    <li> Really happy with this electric razor.  Was hoping to find a replacement for blades, got tired of spending $14-$20 a month on replacements so got this.

    <li> Worked perfect for dad&#x27;s razor.</li>
    <li> This is second set of replacement foil and blades. Works fine just like the original blades.  I still think all replacement blades are generally way too expensive though.</li>
    <li> It was simple and easy to install.  Now it works like new.  This shaver has been very good since buying it last year.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement. Works like new. Didnt realize how dull the old blades and foil were. Shaves like new again. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Blades cut close, great shave. Blades came packaged well, made my razor feel like new. Price was right. Would buy again in 6 months.</li>
    <li> Battery life is great and it out performs my other name brand razor.</li>
    <li> Works great with existing shaver and saved money buying one in home country as well (Australia). Also gives you a smooth irritation free shave as well.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Feel sharp but not closely shave as the original. Probably need to change every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure these are good but if you own a Panasonic LT41 or LT71, you wasted your money. These may fit, but if you look in your manual the replacement model number is WES9013 which is almost 1/2 the cost of this replacement set (yes, what is advertised on Amazon as the replacement number in the chart is NOT correct). Trust your owners manual. (You can download one from Panasonic&#x27;s website.)</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005DKKBTC Panasonic ES-LF51-A  Arc4 Men&#x27;s Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Flexible Pivoting Head]]Smooth shave.  I hadn&#x27;t bought an electric razor in over 20 years so don&#x27;t know how good today&#x27;s competition is.  That being said, it does not shave as close as a regular razor but close enough.  I&#x27;m actually rating the Panasonic shaver ES-LF51-A.  Very pleased.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have used several types of electric shavers and I really like Panasonic shavers.  The replacement foils and blades are a bit expensive, but the shavers are durable and do a good job.  The only downside I have found to them is that they do not do well at holding the shaved off hair.</li>
    <li> The original Panasonic shaver is a real work horse.  These replacement blades and screens fit perfect, work perfect, and keep the shaver running just like new.</li>
    <li> This replacement part if not identical is a perfect fit for my razor. If you have the same model, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Replaced the blades after 1.5 years of use... Feels like a brand new shaver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy replacement of parts... Hardest part was opening the plastic packagaing</li>
    <li> Great shaver, I&#x27;ve tried Remingtons and Brauns before and this one has been the best of all those.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves it. The replacement fit like a charm.</li>
    <li> great fac replacement. my puppy chewed my razor to shreds and thoight it was done for...ibwas searching razors and this poped up. great!!!</li>
    <li> Ive had these blades for approximately 1 month and they are definitely not like the originals in terms of performance. For the first 2-3 weeks, they worked well and performed like the original. Unfortunately, this quickly went away. I know others have stated the same.</li>
