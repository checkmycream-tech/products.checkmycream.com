<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is as good as others which cost much more.  My dental hygenist said my teeth were absolutely clean; and I don&#x27;t use floss, just picks. Holds up, too.</li>
    <li> Yes:    A good hygene tool.  Brushes thorughly with flossing tip.    Charge lasts reasonably long on new model.    No:     I&#x27;ve had two of the older model and the motors wore out more quickly than I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush for myself and I think this is a good product. The rotating bristles are good enough to clean your teeth thoroughly.   However, I would give it 3 stars because there is one design flaw and that is you need to hold the grip up by at least 30 degrees otherwise the toothpaste-saliva thing from your mouth flows back into rotating steel thing on which the bristles are attached.This is unhygienic and bad for the electric motor inside.  I wonder if others have had the same problem.  Overall good for the price.</li>
    <li> The Oral B Vitality Precision clean does not have the run time my old Oral B had. After a full charging I am fortunate to get three days out of it before putting it back on the charging stand.</li>
    <li> These electric toothbrushes are low-priced, reliable, and as effective as those costing several times as much.</li>
    <li> i was using an Oral-B cross action toothbrush for a couple of years (the one with the replaceable battery) and after changing countless of batteries and brush heads i wasnt getting the desired performance and it showed on my teeth. i was on the verge of giving up on  powered toothbrushes cuz i didnt have the heart to throw around $100 for those high end models which \\&quot;work\\&quot;.    But after reading favorable reviews for this model i thought i would give powered brushes a last chance and boy i was lucky.. this toothbrush works great. i noticed a change in the appearance of my teeth immediately after the first use and many stains just disappeared.     although my gums bled after a few uses (they do mention this in the instructions which come with it) and my teeth are now a bit sensitive, the feeling you get after a cleaning with a dentist. but i think that will go away after some use.    All and all a great product, i havent used the more expensive brushes but i dont think they can do a better job than this....and if they do i really think the dentists will have to go on welfare ;)</li>
    <li> Very basic electric toothbrush but does what it&#x27;s supposed to at a very reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I think that this toothbrush is wonderful.  I was using Crest Spinbrush before this one.  This one is much more quiet than the Spinbrush.  Also, the head is thinner which makes it easier to get at the back molars.  I just love how it tells me when it&#x27;s been two minutes.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I&#x27;m always fast when I count 1-60 so I know when to switch from my bottom teeth to my top teeth and when to stop brushing my teeth all together.  The charger for the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t even look like a charger.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years and it finally wore out.  Oh, it still operates beautifully, but the toothbrush won&#x27;t stay on anymore.  But, I liked it so much that I bought another just like it and expect to get 10 or more years use from it.  I would strongly recommend this product.  Did I mention?  It does a heck of a job cleaning your teeth too.</li>
    <li> I love my Oral-B Vitality!  I enjoy the two-minute pulsating timer and the smaller brush head that fits in my smaller mouth.  I&#x27;m finally able to reach all the way to the back of my mouth with this brush head, a feat not common to me with normal brush heads and my small jaws. Additionally, the rotating head really gives me a fresh clean and helps to whiten my teeth naturally.  I have also found the unit is easy to clean with hot water and takes up very little counter space.  The rotating head is great for a gum massage, too. I thought the original brush head attachment was way too rough, but replaced the brush head with the sensitive brush head type and the toothbrush is now perfect!</li>
    <li> Had a recent trip to the dentist where she recommended I start using an electric toothbrush. She recommended Oral B Vitality or some expensive brand that was about $100. I shopped around and found the Oral B Vitality through Amazon and ordered one for me and one for my husband. We both think they are a great product and a very good value.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace an older model which lasted a few years.  Good cleaning action; hopefully it lasts as long as previous one.</li>
    <li> I was just about to purchase a $90 Braun after the batteries in my last $80 Braun gave up the ghost, when I came across this one. Money is hard to come by these days was and shelling out so much for a new toothbrush was making me cringe, so I ordered this one. It works great, has a built-in 2 minute timer and gets my teeth as clean as the last one. It is a bit louder and doesn&#x27;t have the 30 sec quadrant timer like my last one, but it is also a whole lot less expensive. I&#x27;m very happy with it and would reccomend it and purchase another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great way to get kids to brush their teeth well. For the price, it&#x27;s one-third the price that I paid for mine and is a good starter for them to get in the habit of using it</li>
    <li> I use oral-B for a long time.  This type is good.    But the input voltage is 100-130, not suitable for travelling around the world.</li>
    <li> Is there a review with less than one star?  The brush is stopped working after one day of use.  Customer support says I just didn&#x27;t charge it enough.  They informed me to charge the brush for 16 hours.  I have done so, but it is still not working.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t give this product a review because it did not work. Wait a minute, it did run for 30 seconds. I am disapointed that my money was refunded without trying to replace my none working toothbrush. I would have thought customer satisfaction would have been the first priorty.</li>
    <li> I prefer the oscillating movement.  This is a great brush.  The head is small enough to reach absolutely everywhere, and on a full charge it&#x27;s powerful enough to feel like you&#x27;re flossing too!  We bought them at Amazon for around $12, a promo price that comes around every once in a while.  At that price it&#x27;s barely more than a disposable battery brush, but far more effective in my opinion.  Also the charger is very compact, so the footprint on the bathroom counter is not even an issue.</li>
    <li> I think it is a good product and then ordered replacement brushes from Razor which they sent quickly very good service on both products.</li>
    <li> This is well worth the price. I was looking for a low end electric toothbrush to see if I like having an electric toothbrush. I have been sold on the electric part and I really see no reason why I would need to upgrade to a more expensive toothbrush. I have been a manual toothbrush person forever. I had one other electric one a long time ago but it was loud and didn&#x27;t hold a charge well so I was always skeptical. But this Oral-B toothbrush is great. It isn&#x27;t super loud and it is comfortable to hold. The charge lasts for several days before it begins to lose brushing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is the 2 minute timer. It has made me much better at brushing for a the correct period of time.  Some of the more expensive brushes beep every 30 seconds so you know when to switch regions, but I have gotten so used to this that I usually finish brushing everything within 5 seconds of the 2 minutes. In addition to a more thorough cleaning, I can definitely say that the electric brush cleans much better than a manual brush. The brush heads last, the entire assembly is easy to clean, and replacements are not that expensive. If you are trying to decide whether or not to try an electric toothbrush, this is a great one to start with. It is inexpensive and works great. There is no need to spend upwards of $100 for something like this.  If you already have an electric and are looking for a replacement, well my dentist likes the results of this brush so this is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  Just used it for the first time!  I think I followed the direction correctly.  Minimal wrist pressure, just let the weight of the thing do it&#x27;s own work, like shaving with a DE blade.  My mouth feels so fresh!  Like I just came out of a dentist (without the rubber taste if applicable).  My teeth feel and seem very clean, definitely a nicer feeling than after using my old manual brush.  If anyone is wondering like I was, it did not tickle.  Much :P. The two minute timer is great!  It was starting to feel like forever, I must only brush my teeth for 30 seconds or something!  But very clearly I felt and heard the three pulses telling me my two minute recommendation was finished. The charging base is pretty cool simply because of the whole no-metallic parts thing, but you still can&#x27;t drop the charging base in the sink.  You know, electrical chords and such. Charges in 16 hours, which I know, sounds like forever to run it for 2 minutes, but this isn&#x27;t an RC car you are waiting to play with.  And if you are waiting to play with a toothbrush, you have other issues. Plug it in when you get it, and by the time you are getting ready to go to bed, or getting ready in the morning, it will be good to go!    PROS:  -GREAT, clean feeling  -Nifty charging base  -long chord if needed  -FANTASTIC price for the brush and replacement heads!  -Easy to use  -BIG findable button, but has resistance so you won&#x27;t accidentally press it.  -Stands up on it&#x27;s own. I don&#x27;t have to worry about germs and stuff on my toothbrush!  -Nifty in general.  -Toothpaste doesn&#x27;t spin off it in any way.  Benefit of vibrating instead of spinning heads.  -Washable handle  CONS:  -colors? Designs? Fun? -1/4 star.  trivial, I know, but I like my personalization options.  -Compared to manual toothbrushes, the head of this doesn&#x27;t quite contour or fit in your jaw like a manual does.  Requires a bit of maneuvering, but I was always stretching my cheeks out brushing anyway, and apparently that&#x27;s bad!  -1/4 star  -Base is not magnetic.  You COULD jiggle this thing out of place and onto the floor, which, as someone who grew up with a litterbox in his bathroom, really disturbs me when a toothbrush falls.  -Doesn&#x27;t tan you.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush because I don&#x27;t need to replace any batteries. Saves a lot of money in that respect. You can buy replacement toothbrushes as needed. Great item.</li>
    <li> I love the timer feature but was very surprised when it came with an  entirely different and huge brush head rather than the one shown in all the pictures.  It is usable but I have bought this brush before because the head is  smaller than other brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for about a year now at my dentists recommendation. She said that I was missing some hard to reach areas in the back of my mouth (near the wisdom teeth) where a manual brush is pretty insufficient. She said you can find very inexpensive electric brushes and mentioned that Oral-B had a great solution.    As a young man who has commonly had cavity&#x27;s filled nearly every 6 months, after purchasing this, six months later I had the first cleaning I can remember for probably the last 6-7 years with no issues!     I&#x27;ve replaced the brush a few weeks ago and as with most of these you can find generic replacement heads that work fine for half the price.     I highly recommend this brush. I get a good 4-5 brushes between charges and it does the job. I&#x27;m not sure what else a brush can do that&#x27;s 2-5 times the price but until they learn to floss for me too, this seams to suffice perfectly fine.     Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> After 10 years, my old Oral B finally \\&quot;died\\&quot; and I was searching online to find one that was comparable.  I decided to take my chance (after reading all the reviews) and order this one from Amazon.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality.  It comes with more updated bigger bristle brush and it&#x27;s pretty powerful.</li>
    <li> This works well as a basic poered toothbrush, though it is slower than the more deluxe Braun units.  Well worth the 2o bucks or so it sells for.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for brushing my dog&#x27;s teeth.  Works great, very convenient!</li>
    <li> This is one of the cheapest electric brush u can find. I wanted to try them for my kid. Not for me, since I am a devoted manual brusher. But my opinion of the electric brush changed immediately after my first brushing.    This cheapest electric brush was doing much better job at brushing than I was. It turned out to be little too strong for my 2.2 year old. So he will have to wait but I gained a basic brush I felt in love and I can&#x27;t wait to upgrade in the future.     Pro: Price - cheap, get one. Brush compatible with more expensive ones so this brush makes perfect sense to be your first electric brush. Performs well.  Con: uses NiCad battery. Any device with NiCad are planned obsolescent equipment. Do not buy. unless that is disposable. Li-Ion ones are like $80+.     Buy Buy Buy.. there is absolutely no reason not to buy and use electric brush. I will make sure everyone I know use it and you should too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a year or so ago.  The start/stop button was two separate areas, which was excellent, not one like this one, which only had one for the on/off button.  Poor design for sure!    At best, this one with the multi-function button will last about 6 months, tops!    If manufacturers are concerned about the environment with the so-called green movement, then why don&#x27;t they make their products to LAST like they did in the OLDEN days. I&#x27;ll tell you why, GREED!    This is better than the lower price $6.00 type items, but don&#x27;t expect it to last a year.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I initially bought one for myself.  So pleased, got one for my husband.  Then ordered three for my daughter and her two children.  Then ordered two more for my other daughter and her son.  Will now order one for my grandaughter.  I guess that tells you how great these are.  And the price is fantastic.  Just wish the refills were not so expensive.  But there is always E-Bay.  Sorry Amazon.</li>
    <li> The brush died after 6 weeks of light use, alternating with a manual brush. In the meantime, the metal melted and caused noticeable taste and probably can be attributed for some metal accumulation on a tooth. This is not worth it even at this price.</li>
    <li> Be careful and save the packaging and warranty information if you buy this brush.  While it is a good brush for a good price, mine didn&#x27;t last for 9 months before it started losing its ability to hold a full charge.  Now, after having it for 13 months, I can only use it 3-4 times before it needs to be recharged!  So, I just called the phone number in the package insert, and complained.  They are sending me a new one!  (There are no service centers where I live).   This is a good buy, and I like the fact that it fits multiple kinds of brush heads.  The 2 minute timer is nice as well.  But, this brush was not built to last.  (Though what, nowadays, is??)  The key is to complain and get your money back or hold the company up to its warranty.  Thankfully, this brush comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> For the price you cant beat this product, IF the problem I&#x27;m experiencing can be solved.  &lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these brushes, one for my home bathroom and one for my work-out bag. Love the price and timer feature...  &lt;br /&gt;But it seems that once I&#x27;ve used up the power in the brush, it wont recharge properly. I&#x27;m experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long I leave it in the charger. &lt;br /&gt;If there is a simple fix for this then I&#x27;d say 5 stars. If not, then 2 Stars is well earned, seeing as how I&#x27;ve been on their support line waiting (as I type this) for over an hour.</li>
    <li> This is Oral B&#x27;s bait model intended to get you hooked on its brush heads. The toothbrush itself is powerful and well built. If you are going to commit to paying up for those expensive brush heads anyway, this is the best bargain  for a power brush.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time and performed as expected. For the price, it&#x27;s an excellent unit.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my Professional Model Oral B.  Would I buy another one?  Probably not!  However, I would buy another Professional model in a heart beat.  It&#x27;s the best electric toothbrush on the market today.</li>
    <li> I just recently got my braces off, and realized that my teeth were quite yellow after their two-year confinement in a metal cage. My old non-electric toothbrush just wasn&#x27;t gonna cut it. So, I went to Amazon (naturally) and found this cheap electric toothbrush. I was not disappointed. My teeth were sparkly white after 2 weeks, and they remain there. The two-minute timer is an excellent feature, and very noticeable. The brush head is just the right size for my teeth, and does a very thorough job. Overall, great brush for a great price.</li>
    <li> I have used similar brushes, and noticed surprisingly good results from checkups at the dentist&#x27;s office once I switched from a regular brush to one of these rechargeable motorized ones. Not the ones powered by AAA batteries, I tried one of those when my first Braun brush failed, and it&#x27;s nothing like this. Not nearly the same power or speed. Since the AAA one was complete fail, I ordered this brush, and it is faster/more powerful than my previous one of the same brand. (The first one lasted for years.) This is money well spent. My mother reported similarly effective results with hers, based on her own visits to the dentist. Planning to buy some as presents in fact.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if dentists prefer Oral B electric brushes, but I do.   I have needed to replace previous models because rechargeable battery goes after 3 years or so.   I&#x27;ve never bought the expensive ones.   These cheaper models seem to work just fine.    Pros &#x3D; charge lasts a week or more, charger is petite and easily tucks into a drawer when not in use or it can be mounted to a wall.  Cons &#x3D; still think the brush heads themselves are expensive.   Look for sales.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 for my daughters. They love them. Such a good value verses the much higher priced &#x27;Professional Care&#x27; 2 packs.</li>
    <li> The product shipped promptly and has worked as advertised. We were pleased with the price.</li>
    <li> My 2nd Sonicare toothbrush died, so I picked up this Oral-B.  For what I paid, I guess I can&#x27;t complain.      There are things I prefer about my Sonicare, like the fact that it had a charging indicator, it was much quieter, and seemed more powerful.    For what I paid for this Oral-B, I guess I can&#x27;t complain.  It does the job, although it is much louder than my Sonicare.  I have noticed that the toothbrush seems to \\&quot;bog down\\&quot; if you use anything but light pressure.  I mean it get&#x27;s a bit bogged down when it&#x27;s rubbing up against my cheek when brushing my back molars.  There is no charging indicator on the unit, so there&#x27;s no way of knowing whether it is charging or not.  I will say, however, I do prefer the brush head size/shape in comparison to Sonicare&#x27;s shape/size.  I was even using the compact brush head&#x27;s with my Sonicare, but the Oral-B&#x27;s are just more comfortable and do a better job reaching my back molars.  While I wouldn&#x27;t buy this model again, I will most likely step up to a higher priced model to see if the noise gets any quieter and the motor stronger.  All in all, it was worth it to find out I prefer the brush head shape/size over Sonicare&#x27;s.  Also, the price of the replacement brushes are much more reasonable.  Granted you change these heads ever 3 mths v. 6 mths with the Sonicare, it&#x27;s still a significant savings.</li>
    <li> Very good product and nice price!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush ever and I even didn&#x27;t expect the result  I see just after a few times of use.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush and very affordable!  The brushes last a good amount of time.  You really can feel a difference between brushing with this and a regular toothbrush.  This toothbrush makes it easier to clean around the back of your backteeth-the last molars...You can really feel that it&#x27;s cleaning your teeth and gums.  The timer on it makes it better so that you are aware if you are brushing long enough.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these and both I and my daughter love them.  The product was shipped super fast as well.</li>
    <li> My dentist took one look at my inflamed gums, and strongly suggested I start using an electric toothbrush.  I knew a cheapie like this wouldn&#x27;t last, but I got it to tide me over until I got a proper electric brush.  Even so, this brush was so disagreeable that it induced me to shell out money sooner than I wanted to get a quality brush.    This comes packed with medium bristles.  I was wondering why it was so stiff, but then I went out and got a pack of soft bristles, which barely helped.  The problem with this brush is that it rotates so fast that you have to use a lot of pressure to keep the bristles in contact with your teeth, otherwise it just bounces off them when you use light pressure.  This makes it really hard to control and achieve any degree of precision.  Even with all the extra pressure I exerted, I still had plaque in easy spots that I couldn&#x27;t reach with this brush.    Don&#x27;t be pulled in by the price.  I consider the thing dangerous; it rotates lightning-fast and requires hard pressure.  The whole time I used it, I worried that it was going to damage my gums even more than they were already.  After about a week I ordered a Rotadent, and finally learned what all the fuss was about electric toothbrushes.  Spending extra on a good electric toothbrush is worth it.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with junk like this.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND DOES A GREAT JOB. GREAT FOR THE YOUNGSTER WHO DOESN&#x27;T KNOW HOW TO BRUSH THEIR TEETH WELL. MY 4 YEAR OLD LOVES IT AND SO DO I.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and am absolutely satisfied with this brand.</li>
    <li> Works just about as well as our 10-year old model whose battery just gave up, but at a fraction of the price. Good value!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd or 4th Oral-B toothbrush. They seem to last a year or two, sometimes longer. Unfortunately this one uses a different charging unit than the previous two toothbrushes, so I no longer have a spare to set up at my parents&#x27; house. Other changes over the years include the 2-minute timer (which I don&#x27;t like), and the lack of a light on the toothbrush to indicate that it&#x27;s still charging. But it&#x27;s just a toothbrush so I can live with these changes.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes since before they added the 2 minute timer, or at least on models where a person could afford it.  I have only needed to replace them once the battery would no longer hold a charge, and that is after many years of service.  I was very pleasantly surprised I didn&#x27;t have the pay the big bucks as in past purchases.      This model uses the same heads as my last ones, still has the 2 minute timer.  Can&#x27;t ask for more.  When using Oral-B the dentist has always complemented me on how great my teeth are.  Once I started using Oral-B my checkups improved remarkably.    I highly recommend getting this model, unless you want to pay more for the other Oral-B models.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t think you need to.</li>
    <li> It worked great until yesterday when, after 12 days of use it wouldn&#x27;t shut off, and now it won&#x27;t turn on, it&#x27;s kaput.     This is an update, I got a new one that works fine, we are very happy with it now.</li>
    <li> I went through a few Oral B toothbrushes before I realized that leaving the toothbrush head on the handle after using it allows water to run down the stem into the electronic circuitry inside, which will eventually cause it to short.  They&#x27;d only last about a year or so.  When I opened the handles to take out the batteries for recycling, it was obvious that moisture intrusion was the cause of the problem.  Also, others have mentioned a brownish residue settling on the recharging base.  It finally occurred to me that both of these problems would be solved by simply removing the toothbrush head and wiping off the stem after each use.  I just stand the toothbrush head on the counter by the charger.  Keeps everything looking clean and like new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using some type of Oral B \\&quot;spinny\\&quot; toothbrush for years. My old one just died so I bought this one thinking that the price had come down a lot in the last 3-4 years. Apparently not. This one&#x27;s a lot less expensive but you can tell. I *LOVE* the Oral B line of electric toothbrushes, but don&#x27;t waste your time with the $20 version. But the $80+ ones - they really are that much better. This one spins so poorly; I know I&#x27;m not getting the cleaning I&#x27;ve enjoyed for years. I returned mine and bought the better version and am now very happy.</li>
    <li> For the first time in a long time, I finally have found toothbrush that really makes your mouth feel clean.  It is programmed for a 2 minute warning which really makes me brush longer than I used to.  It&#x27;s strong and doesn&#x27;t shatter your mouth like some of the \\&quot;vibrating brushes\\&quot;  I found this a welcome change to my dental care and highly recommend it to any and all.....and you just can&#x27;t beat the price.[[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> We bought this for my mother-in-law and she just loves it.  Fast shipping.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> Great deal!  The dentist always says to brush for 2 mins, but who really times it?  This is great, you&#x27;ll be surprised how long 2 minutes really is.  But way better cleaner teeth :(&#x3D;) &lt;- see!  I liked it and thought the value was good.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at Target for &lt; $20 after reading reviews here. So far I really like this brush and it really cleans my teeth well. It moves quick enough to give the Sonic feel of the more expensive units. You can&#x27;t go wrong buying one or even two of these!</li>
    <li> I just replaced my old Oral B after (I think) seven or so years.  This one is okay but I liked my old one better and I regret not dishing out more money to get the better one which has two speeds.  This one only has one speed...fast, whereas I used to use the slower speed.  For someone new to this or someone who prefers the fast speed, this one should be fine.  After two weeks of using this, I still find the speed bothersome.  But that&#x27;s just me.  Aside from that, I like the smaller footprint and the two minute \\&quot;buzz\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use this kind of electric toothbrush. I love the way to clean my tooth. Very good start!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife. She is very happy, then, indeed, I am happy. This tooth brush work very good and low cost. I would buy two more if it is on-sale again. Amazon service is prefect for this order. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For around 15 bucks, this rechargeable brush does a good job. My teeth feel cleaner compared to using a manual brush. I haven&#x27;t used any of the more expensive ones (those over $100), so can&#x27;t really say how this compares to those. However, compared to manual brushing, this is easier and more fun to use. So you actually look forward to brushing, which I guess has to be good for your teeth in the long run.    As for the brush head, I think its small enough that it can reach those wisdom teeth at the back, but its large enough to fully surround a molar. To get a feel for how well it scrubs against my teeth, I gently pressed it against my tongue and I must say it does a much better job than a manual brush.    The 2-minute timer is helpful, although I go about three minutes to satisfy myself.</li>
    <li> Product well worth the cost. Holds a charge for over two weeks. Easy to grip handle. Very quiet.</li>
    <li> its a great product, have bought 4 of them for my entire family. Wish it would come in more color options.</li>
    <li> I bought a more expensive power toothbrush for my wife and thought I need one for myself. After doing some research, I pulled the trigger on this one.     For the money, you get   1. an Oral-B power toothbrush with good quality and water proofing   2. reasonable battery time per charge  3. a built in &#x27;stutter&#x27; timer (stutter every 2 min)    It has most of the functionalities as the more expensive ones. There are a couple of weak points:  1. The timer does not reset itself after each use and has a memory effect. To be more specific, if you turned off the toothbrush at 1.5 mins, the next time you use it, it will stutter at 0.5min and recycle the timer.  2. The brush is not very durable. I am guessing the manufacturer intentionally makes it so that you will buy replacement more frequently.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Power Toothbrush because of the great price (others go for $50 - $100+!) and am very very happy with it! It helps get rid of and prevents plaque buildup and it actually makes brushing a lot of fun! And it pulses a few times after 2 minutes (the recomended brushing time) wich I find very convenient. What I also like a lot about this power brush is that it has a variety of different brush heads (my personal favorite - the FlossAction.) These replacement brush heads cost a lot, so I just search eBay and usually find good deals there. Anyway, I have been using the Oral-B Vitality (Precision Clean) Power Toothbrush for over 3 months now and have zero complaints. I am COMPLETELY satisfied with it!!!!</li>
    <li> I used...  Conair Interplak (9 months. Bought at Target)    I now use...  Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean (2 months and counting. Bought on Amazon).    Comparison...  1) Batteries: Both are rechargeable (no need to fuss with buying and replacing batteries). Interplak recommends you run the batteries down every 6 months and then do a full recharge before use again. Oral-B encourages you to keep the toothbrush on the charger all the time, as they claim \\&quot;there is no such thing as over-charging\\&quot;. Interplak has a light that turns on to let you know it&#x27;s charging, Oral-B does not. Interplak&#x27;s charger is bulkier, but that&#x27;s only because it has two ports for you to stick extra/replacement brushes on.  2) Power: Interplak has decent power, but Oral-B is definitely more powerful, and very feisty.  3) Replacement Brushes: To get the best cleaning quality from your electric toothbrush, you should replace the heads around every 3 months. Oral-B brush heads are a bit smaller, which is better for navigating around your mouth and \\&quot;precision cleaning\\&quot;. Department stores are more likely to carry Oral-B replacements, but both are readily available online, and they go for around $5 to $10, depending.  4) Function and use: Dentists recommend at least two minutes of brush time. Oral-B has a two-minute timer, signaled NOT by sound (like I thought), but by short, intermittent bursts, to let you know two minutes are up. This feature is on all the time and cannot be disabled. Interplak does not have this feature. Oral-B has a simple on/off toggle button. Interplak has two buttons - one for on, one for off.    Conclusion...  Personally, I recommend Oral-B over Conair. It was like, NOW I feel like my teeth are clean! Happy shopping~</li>
    <li> This is a really nice design. Sturdy, good ergonomics, and works like a champ. Comfortable to use, very effective cleaning.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 10 years old, and unable to brush her own teeth. We&#x27;d been struggling to brush her teeth using a manual tooth brush, and found that approach inadequate. We&#x27;d tried a Sonicare previously, but found the larger angled head difficult to use, and the vibration was so intense it would freak her out sometimes.      I selected this particular model because the head was small and rounded, making it seem a more comfortable option for my daughter. The results have been fabulous. Her mouth is far cleaner than before. Teeth appear a bit lighter, breath is much fresher, and she initiates tooth brushing every morning, which is new. For us this has been an excellent purchase. Had I known how much this simple change would change our dental routine, I&#x27;d have made it much earlier.     If you are responsible for another person&#x27;s tooth care, I recommend this brush. The small rounded head is easier to negotiate, and more comfortable. The price makes it a safe gamble, and the functionality is excellent.</li>
    <li> Even after a multi-day charging, this product chugs along with minimal power; if you bear down at all, it slows to a crawl. Then, when the two-minute timer goes off, it quits entirely, and refuses to restart. Useless.</li>
    <li> It is a great price compared to the $100 I spent on an Oral-B from Costco. (It lasted approx 5 yrs) Granted the quality isn&#x27;t the same, but I guess you can look at it with a disposable attitude. It doesn&#x27;t have to last as long as the higher quality Oral B.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist.  My wife and I both have them now and they are very effective in keeping our teeth cleaned and polished. Amazon had the best price and is most efficient getting the product to you.</li>
    <li> I love the speed and the feel of the Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Toothbrush.  It&#x27;s easy to maneuver in your mouth and the speed of the brush head feels like it&#x27;s really cleaning your teeth.  The timer on mine is not exactly 2 minutes (it&#x27;s 2:08, so I have to adjust my timing)  I do half the time on my uppers and the rest on my lowers.  I reverse the uppers and lowers morning and evening.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have the toothbrush for a while now. The battery don&#x27;t seem to last what it suppose to. I average brush my teeth 1.5 times a day, and 2 minutes each time. But I have to charge it almost every other week. It&#x27;s my first electric tooth brush, I bought it because of the good reviews I read here, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint me. I like the small brushhead, it can each all places inside my mouth. It&#x27;s pretty loud when it&#x27;s on, but it&#x27;s bearable when the bathroom door is closed, to not distract others.</li>
    <li> I have been through many of these. Don&#x27;t expect them to last more than a year. Unfortunately for the environment, it costs less to buy one of these every year than one more reliable model.    My second issue is that the base only works on 110V. I cannot take this brush with me when I travel, since I cannot recharge it. Adding a transformer in the bathroom is not practical. I&#x27;m sure some more expensive models work on worldwide voltage, but due to overall unreliability of all those toothbrushes, I refuse to buy one. If one carried a warranty of at least 3 years, I would.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s brushing, and then there&#x27;s brushing. Brushing is the good one. Proper brushing  removes stuff from your teeth that, if not regularly removed, can eventually lead to things like plaque build up to gingivitis and eventually even to things like pyorrhea. Pyorrhea is one of the most horrible things that I have ever seen. Proper brushing  is an important part of your oral health regime (along with regular dental check-ups and flossing, etc.). I&#x27;m not a dentist, so I&#x27;m just reiterating what my dentist has told me every six months for the past 39 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, choosing a good toothbrush is a very important part of preventative maintenance. From a frugal living perspective, it always makes sense to practice preventative maintenance (especially with things like dentistry that is generally quite expensive - especially with major surgery). I have used Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes for about five years or so and they were recommended to me by my dentist. I have been one of the &#x60;fortunate ones&#x27; who seems to have been born with good teeth (my teeth are straight and I have never worn braces, I have also only ever had one cavity and it happened way back when I was thirteen years old).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush that I currently use is the Braun Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean electric toothbrush. There are a few important reasons why I love using it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It feels great as you use it. It kind of tickles as it rotates upon your gums and it feels feels like it is giving them a really good massage (although I have never fallen asleep while brushing my teeth, I have nodded off a few times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Your teeth feel really clean after you use it. It&#x27;s not quite the &#x60;I just left the dentist&#x27;s office&#x27; clean, but it gets you pretty close to it. It seems very effective at getting into those &#x60;hard to reach&#x27; areas. I can feel a significant difference between when I use this brush and when I use a manual one (which seems to be only when I go camping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The toothbrush has a built-in timer. Apparently the optimal amount of time that you should be brushing is about two minutes. Many people do not brush anywhere near this amount of time. This brush makes it easy by including a built-in timer that gently pulsates the brush to let you know when two minutes are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other factor to consider, cost-wise, is the cost of the replacement tips. I replace mine about every two to three months and the cost anywhere from between $3-$5 a piece depending on where you buy them and how many you buy in the package. I feel that, despite being more expensive than a regular manual toothbrush, this this ongoing cost is well worth it. I will never use a manual brush again (unless I am camping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are millions of different electric toothbrushes. I am not an electric toothbrush aficionado or a dentist or a dental hygienist. I am just a frugal thirty-nine year old, with his first child on the way any day now, that knows that brushing your teeth well is very important, that this brush is less expensive than many, and that I feel that it does a terrific job of cleaning my teeth and massaging my gums.

    <li> Awesome Brush for the money, bought two brushes for my Grandchildren ages six and nine years old they love these brushes.The two minute auto timer is very helpful as it encourages them to spend more time brushing.Have had the brushes for a month so far no problems.We are so satisfied we are going to purchase two more for ourself for travel.I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace a lost sonicare toothbrush. I did not want to pay $100 dollars again for a toothbrush. This is great replacement for under $20. It cleans really well and being rechargeable you do not have to buy batteries. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and does an amazing job at cleaning your teeth.  Plaque build up is greatly reduced and your teeth are left feeling infinitely cleaner than any manual toothbrush.  I cannot understand the price difference between this and the higher end models.  The only thing to keep in mind with this is that you should not press the brush head too hard against your gums - the action is strong enough to cause irritation and strip the gums away from your teeth if you are overly vigorous with it.  That said, it does such a good job cleaning that everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> I have had the Oral B Vitality toothbrush for about a year. It really does a great job, and my last dental visit was my best ever - no cavities or gum issues, my dentist was impressed. I&#x27;ve tried both the single and dual action heads, and have a preference for the latter (it just feels like it cleans better).    However, I have one major complaint. After only a year, the toothbrush has stopped charging. (This after I fully discharged and recharged it regularly, like they say you should.) I suspect everything in the product works well, except for the rechargeable battery locked inside. However, I must now throw away the entire thing - charger, plug and all - because I cannot change the Ni-Cd battery itself.    Braun, please make this product more environmentally friendly...</li>
    <li> At the suggestion of my periodontist, I purchased this Oral B Vitality Precision and am having a difficult time rating it.  Yes, I think it does the job.  When the brush vibrates at the two minute mark, I am able to keep brushing because it does not stop until I turn it off.  The problem with me is that I have been using the Oral B Cross Action battery operated brush for years and in comparing this new brush to the battery operated, I believe the battery operated Cross Action brush did a better job. My mouth felt cleaner after using the battery operated brush.  Perhaps if I buy the Cross action brush heads for the Vitality Precision, I will be more positive. Since the periodontist told me I was doing a great job brushing (with my Oral B battery operated), perhaps I was too fast to even consider a different toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Best tooth brush- 2 min for 2 times will keep the dentist away for cleaning your teeth. I am dentist and would recommend it to any one who is not interested in spending lots of $$ on more expensive stuff. This would be the best start up brush for any change from your manual to electric brush\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I first received one of these tooth brushes as a stocking stuffer at Christmas 5 years ago.  It was my favorite gift I got that year.  I&#x27;ve tried traveling without taking it, but never feel like my teeth are as clean as when I use my Oral-B Vitality.  I recently switched dentists and they gave me a new one.  I love having two.  I keep one at work and one at home so my teeth are always silky smooth and breath is minty fresh.  The two minute timer is a great way to make sure you&#x27;re brushing long enough.  Holds a charge for a several days, so I can take it on a weekend trip without the charger and feel confident that it will last all weekend.  Great product for a low price.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out an electric toothbrush. For a first buy, this is a good deal. Cheap it but does the job!</li>
    <li> Does everything it is supposed to and more. My Dentist recommended I buy a $100.+ version of this brush since my gums were beginning to recede and the plaque buildup was bad. I did my homework and decided that this unit would fit my needs and I gave it a try.    Works great and I went back to my Dentist 30 days later for a followup checkup and my gums, which had begun to recede, were making a substantial rapid improvement and NO plaque buildup. He was very impressed. He asked if I had bought the Hi-Tech Elect Toothbrush he recommended for $100.+ somewhere else and I told him no, I got a good one on Amazon for under $20.     Fantastic value.. Love it..</li>
    <li> I have had this for a year. It no longer holds a charge. The grip gets filthy really fast. The place where the brush head connects to the handle gets filthy fast also. The bottom which sits on the charger and the charger itself get moldy if you place your brush on it after you brush. You have to let it completely dry, but then it dies and you have no charge for brushing. Some major design flaws.</li>
    <li> I previously had a cordless version of this toothbrush, but was plagued with issues changing the batteries. This one is perfect since I don&#x27;t have to ever change a battery. The drawback being that I have to use up valuable counter space and and electrical outlet. The number of rotations is astounding and leaves my mouth and teeth feeling wonderful clean and tingly. I absolutely LOVE the timer. It really does help me ensure that I have brushed the dentist recommended amount of time for a truly clean mouth! I also appreciate that I can chose from different kinds of replacement heads to see if a different one fits my needs better.</li>
    <li> My mother bought me one of these rechargeable Oral B toothbrushes when I was 19, I am now 31.  I use it at least once a day, most likely right before I go to bed.  I have not gone to the dentist since I was 17, until 6 months ago.  The dentist didn&#x27;t believe that I had not seen a dentist in that long of a time, I have NO cavities and I use the cheapest toothpaste money can buy (I don&#x27;t even think its anti-cavity).  I am very much a true believer of this toothbrush and have since bought all of my kids and my step kids these to use.  I am glad now the new versions have the two minute timer, as my first one did not.  The price of this toothbrush is SO valuable, however the replacement heads are kinda expensive, I can get them for about $5 a piece, but I guess filling cavities would cost more money.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works great and definitely better than expected for just paying $20. Definitely a must buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush last Christmas 08, and it&#x27;s still going strong!  Great quality, even better price!  It&#x27;s a total score!</li>
    <li> The price is great for this toothbrush, especially comparing it to the rest of electric toothbrushes out there. With this great price comes some design flaws. The Vitality is shaped differently than the AdvancePower (which my wife is using now and is happy with). The AdvancePower is shaped with the wide part at the base, whereas the Vitality is wide at the top and tapers down at the bottom. While it might not seem like a big deal, the result is that your toothpasty saliva very easily drips down the body of the toothbrush and onto your fingers and hand. Even when I&#x27;m careful, on most days my toothpasty saliva gets all over my hands, and it is the most annoying thing in the world. So unless you raise your elbow up to the sky every single time (which is not terribly comfortable), expect your hands to get dirty. Also as a result of the tapered shape, the toothbrush falls over easily, causing the head (that you stick in your mouth!) to get dirty. This toothbrush is as annoying as ever... but it does run well, and I can&#x27;t complain too much because I didn&#x27;t pay that much for it.</li>
    <li> The Oral Bs are good brushes, I have been using them for a long time. I bought this for my kid and contrary to its claims, my kid has to recharge the brush every other day, so at 2 minutess each brushing session and 2x a day, that means one charge is good for 8 minutes before it dies.</li>
    <li> This brush is powerful, and is overall a pleasant brushing experience. I also have an [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], but hardly ever use it. I prefer to use this toothbrush with the optional soft heads [[ASIN:B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]]. This electric toothbrush is very effective at cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Also, check out my review on the Oral-B Pulsonic if you want a comparison between the two.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for 4 months and love it. At the same time that I bought the toothbrush I also bought the 4 replacement pack of brush heads from US HEALTH TESTS thru Amazon.com, not knowing that the replacements were generic. At 3 months I replaced the original brush head (which was performing great) with the generic replacement. After a week it became so loose that it pinched my tongue and lips. Installed the second generic replacement. Same problem. Contacted US HEALTH TESTS and explained the problem, they sent me a new generic replacement 4 pack at no charge. I am on the first replacement brush head of the second 4 pack and am having the same problem. This is one of many reviews with the same toothbrush head replacement problems, which causes me to ask Amazon.com and anyone else that may have the answer \\&quot;WHERE CAN YOU BUY ORIGINAL REPLACEMENT BRUSHHEADS FOR ORAL-B ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES\\&quot;???????.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Oral B Vitality toothbrush for just over 6 months. I just had my 1st dental exam after using it, &amp; it was the best ever! My dentist said my gums have never looked better, I didn&#x27;t have to have ANY cleaning at all!! They just did my exam &amp; polished my teeth. When I asked about the cleaning, the hygienist said I didn&#x27;t need any cleaning because I did not have anything to be cleaned off! WOW! I love how the heads on the brush have bristles that stick out further on the outer row to get your gumline &amp; between your teeth cleaned. It also has a 2 minute timer which doesn&#x27;t reset itself if you stop for a few seconds to spit. I love this toothbrush &amp; I hope Oral B never stops carrying it. I started using it after my previous brand&#x27;s heads became harder &amp; harder to find, &amp; the price kept going up to almost $8/head! I called Oral B customer service &amp; was referred to this brush. The rep said that this brush head only goes around &amp; doesn&#x27;t pulsate, so it&#x27;s easier on your teeth. I had used a more expensive Oral B model for a few years, but it was just too hard on my teeth, &amp; they became super sensitive. That&#x27;s not the case with the brush. I love it! The Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat either.</li>
    <li> It is great.  I just had to wait too long to get it because of back order.!!!  But it is worth the wait!!!</li>
    <li> My family has been using this product for years. Simple, but efficient. The two minute timer is handy. I just replaced my last Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush after 8 years of use. The replacement heads are on the expensive side, but shop around and get a four pack when they are on sale.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years.  This one is the best I have used -easier to use than the previous models because one can turn the tip to reach both back and front and side-to side in the mouth.  The fact that it costs quite a bit less than previous models does&#x27;nt hurt, either,</li>
    <li> This  is my second Oral-B rotary toothbrush.  The first one lasted more than 5 years.  When I told my dentist I used an Oral-B rotary, she gave me a big smile and said \\&quot;good choice\\&quot;.  I like the 2-minute timer.  It makes me pay attention to what I&#x27;m doing and to brush each surface the correct amount of time.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in good condition.    Pro: 1. Rapid motion. 2. Solidly built. 3. Uses standard Oral-B brushes. 4. Automatic 2-minute alarm. 5. Easy to grip and control.    Con: 1. Charging unit is suited only for American current, so if you are going to travel you&#x27;ll need either a transformer or a different brush/charger. 2. There is no way of telling if the unit is charging (i.e. a light that goes on when the handle makes proper contact with the charger). 3. The On and Off buttons are not clearly demarcated and you have to locate them by touch, which can take some getting used to.    Overall I really had to dig to find anything negative to say. This is an excellent item which I have been using for over a month and I recommend it to anyone in the market for an inexpensive tool that is totally well suited for its task.</li>
    <li> Was hesitant to purchase an expensive rechargeable toothbrush without first trying one out. Discovered this Oral-B model and took it out for a test drive. Have not been to the dentist yet but believe that he will be pleasantly surprised. After each &#x27;brushing,&#x27; the teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> This is almost exactly the same as the Braun  it is replacing.  The Braun lasted more than 15 years.  I don&#x27;t use the timer...I brush longer than the timer.  Great value (under $20) and I recommend.</li>
    <li> Having used electric spin brushes for a few years now, I have become a firm believer.  The big reason is, my dentist only has to do a little cleaning and spends a very short time on me.  \\&quot;Disgustingly healthy\\&quot; is how he once joked about my teeth.  Also, brushing is much less work.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush is fine... just a little different than the one I had prior to it.  I would recommend to others.  Does a good job.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun&#x27;s electric toothbrushes for many years with a high degree of satisfaction. Like all the others before it, this particular brush is powerful, reliable and, unlike the previous ones, very inexpensive. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend I asked him to rate it he doesn&#x27;t really have anything to compare to hints the 4 stars but I feel once you switch to an electric toothbrush you won&#x27;t wanna go back to manual brushing.</li>
    <li> I bought it for myself and love it. Small brush head is very gentle on your teeth and gum. Recharger is small and convenient. Battery life is good. Simple great product.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d chime in here... I bought my Oral B rechargeable toothbrush almost 10 years ago... Yes, that&#x27;s TEN years ago! And it&#x27; just now starting to die on me (thus why I&#x27;m here getting a new one). It has been dropped in a sink full of water by my kids, dropped on the floor, taken camping (where in its early years it held a charge for about 4 days), in numerous hotels, on a cruise and more! LOL It&#x27;s been my faithful companion for these last ten years and the best $20 investment I&#x27;ve ever made! Well, actually, 10 years ago, I only paid $16.00 for it. I haven&#x27;t had any cavities in the last 8 years and my dentist compliments my lack of tarter. Although I&#x27;m sure he misses my cavity business ($$). The small head is easy to manuever around in my mouth that I think it&#x27;s easier to brush than with a standard \\&quot;long\\&quot; head brush. The vibrations are gentle and powerful leaving me with a super clean feeling without effort. My secret is that I rarely floss anymore either because the small head gets in between my teeth so well (shhh! I hate flossing!). The replaceable heads last me about 4 months... that&#x27;s 3 per year. No big deal. I don&#x27;t know how this toothbrush compares to high-end systems like Sonicare, but I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone would need a toothbrush better than this for this price. I swear to you, get this. You will never regret it and you will tell strangers about it because you&#x27;ll be so in love.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for the money - I&#x27;ve been using mine for 2 years, and have no complaints.  The internal battery recharges to it&#x27;s original strength.  I really like the 2 minute timer.  I recommend this brush over the really expensive options on the market.  It does a great job cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful brush that cleans the teeth oh so well.  We have used quite a few of these already, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  The brush lasted us about 1 or 1.5 years max (maybe less sometimes).  Though the dentists might dispute this, the brush cleans well enough that even if you skip flossing every now and then, it is quite all right.  We kept replacing the heads as needed.  Don&#x27;t regret the buy at all.</li>
    <li> I am very particular to pick up my toothbrush and I am very satisfied with Oral-B. First of all it has a small head. I always had a problem to clean my teeth in the back around my wisdom teeth. The other toothbrush has way to big head and really hard for me to reach that area. With Oral-B small rotating head is very easy and I can feel the difference how clean is my teeth after brushing them.     Second, it&#x27;s rechargeable so I don&#x27;t have to do anything with it just put it back to the station and leave there until I use it again.</li>
    <li> great.  works just like lot more expensive models.  only difference i can tell is that it does not have a light to show it is charging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model of the Oral-B toothbrush for almost 2 years. It works great, but I do find the timer feature to be quite annoying. The timer activates at least 2 or 3 times during my brushing session. I&#x27;m not quite sure what purpose it serves, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to deactivate it. Mechanically, this device has worked flawlessly. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it maintaining a proper charge, and all of the brush heads (I&#x27;ve gone through a couple of dozen) have worked without any malfunctions of any sort. Best of all, my teeth are cleaner and whiter since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Skeptical to use an electric toothbrush but my dentist said I should. So, I tried it. Teeth feel amazing. I love the timer that lets you know you are ok to stop. Unbeknown to me, prior to using this brush I was not brushing long enough.</li>
    <li> Works very well, just like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Third day I use it and I already notice cleaner teeth, especially the hard to reach molars at the back. Also, it has a 2-minute timer. You press the button, and start brushing. Then, it will pulsate 3 times, which means the 2 minutes passed, and then you just turn it off and rinse. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitality tooth brush for years, and bought my wife one.  She loves it.  Good quality, I&#x27;ve had mine for years and did not need to replace it yet (Just replace the brush heads periodically).</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does an excellent brushing job -- no need to buy a more expensive model.  I bought this one to replace a similar Oral B that lasted more than 8 years before the battery conked out.  Great product! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> My first electric toothbrush.  Works fine although I still think a regular toothbrush works just as good.  Lasts at least a week on a single charge (although now I just leave it plugged in and charged all the time).  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for nearly six months now and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I&#x27;ve always been something of an over-brusher and thought I was doing fine with my old manual toothbrush, but was amazed at how much cleaner my teeth felt after the first use with this.  I still can&#x27;t get it done in the 2-minute timer period, and generally take at least 4, so I figure this unit has actually done double duty this past 6 months, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is quite a bargain....I felt like a just brushed dentist feeling after using this toothbrush for the first time.</li>
    <li> My rather expensive power toothbrush quit and instead of spending the time to research a replacement, I bought this one.  It is great.  I love the two minute warning. No need to worry about another one, I&#x27;ll stick with this one.</li>
    <li> Gentler than my old braun oral-b which is a positive, and still cleans well. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long, but at 1/4 the price, I can buy 4 of these for the same price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few electric toothbrushes over the years including a couple of Sonicares, and this Oral-B toothbrush is easily my favorite. My mouth has never felt this clean, and my most recent trip to my dentist was great confirmation--only 1 small area of plaque on 1 tooth. The dental assistant was perplexed that she didn&#x27;t really have any work left to do. Also, while Sonicare&#x27;s have an oscillation cavity that inadvertently collects the \\&quot;runoff\\&quot; during brushing (yuck!), the Oral-B doesn&#x27;t suffer from the same issue. With these advantages and a modest price, I can strongly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is the best value in electric toothbrush, I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 weeks now and it&#x27;s worth every penny. I can brush better than most people using regular toothbrush, but this electric one allows me to clean below the gum line better.     However, the replacement heads are expensive; a 3-pack cost almost as much as the entire toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It gets my teeth super clean. Unlike the fuller head counterpart, the small round head allows you to give each tooth individual attention. The head would be small enough for a child to use. It is also lightweight. It is quieter than other brands like the cheap Crest power toothbrushes. It gives the cleaning of a much more expensive toothbrush.     The replacement heads are a bit pricey. I leave mine on the charger to store it. It loses some power quickly when not fully charged, but still cleans acceptably for probably 4 days of no charge. The timer is a great feature to let you know that you&#x27;re brushing long enough. It takes so much less effort to brush than with a manual toothbrush that you will have no trouble getting those 2 minutes in.    Some other reviewers have complained that the battery quit taking a charge after a year or so, but even if that happens you&#x27;re still better off cost wise to replace this toothbrush many times over than to pay the hundreds of dollars to get the same clean in a more expensive brush.    I recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the tooth brush.  Good battery life, does a good job, small and easily mounted charger.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the battery-powered model for several years, and when it failed, decided to upgrade.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this rechargeable product so far (in use for about a month).  Unlike with the battery-powered unit, there is no slowdown as the batteries get weak, so I get a more consistent cleaning.  The charger uses an induction system so there is no electrical contact between the base and hand-piece, vastly reducing the probability for shock.  Comfortable to hold and, most of all, effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different brands of power toothbrushes for the past 10 years.  I started off with the Colgate battery powered ones, and they were good for dorm life but not a longterm investment.  These Oral B brushes are great.  They have different variations in the $20 price range, and they&#x27;re great investments but keep in mind the rechargeable battery does eventually poop out (I&#x27;ve had to replace mine about every 2 years).  This last part I don&#x27;t mind because dirty mouths yield dirty toothbrushes!  The instructions state that to properly clean after brushing, you need to remove the brushead and rinse under running water.      PROS:  This model has a rubberized grip, 2 minute timer (I didn&#x27;t brush long enough before), rechargeable, never experienced overheating, since using these brushes my dentist says my gums look great, small enough to get precision cleaning    CONS:  Will most likely need to replace unit every 2 years or so, expensive brusheads (keep an eye on Amazon sales) - I might put too much pressure on my brush but I have to replace a brushead every 2 months although the savings in dental bills make up for that!    If you&#x27;re new to power brushes, it takes some time to get used to the vibrations, but that&#x27;s the cleaning mechanism.</li>
    <li> I really like this tooth brush with it&#x27;s plug in power way better than the battery tooth brush, I have used before. Maybe a little too poweful in the beginning if your teeth are sensative but works great once you get accustomed to it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son and he loves it.  He brushes his teeth without complaint every morning and evening!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll need heavy duty shears to open packages like these. This package, worse than others of its ilk, had difficult to reach edges so be prepared for a real battle to get it open...Also look very closely to locate highly camouflaged battery direction (+/-) indicators...Once you get the toothbrush in your hands and batteries installed correctly it works fairly well...Order it from a store that will unpack it for you. The packaging will dissolve if submerged in sulfuric acid. Wonderful for the environment (if anyone cares any more.)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. I just turned to electric toothbrush and feel good about it till now. It can keep powerful for about one week or less once full charged (16 hrs). And it&#x27;s safe for charging even in the bathroom, because you cannot see any metal material under the bottom of the toothbrash and the surface of the base.</li>
    <li> I live in the UK and have the same product in the 240V version. I bought this to use while I travel in the US. The products are comparable in quality and function, although I think the 240V version recharges more quickly. I Can&#x27;t see the point of paying 2-3 times the price for a product that does exactly the same and uses the same brushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really simple to brush, but the care required for washing the actual brush is a bit of a nagging flaw. A previous electric toothbrush I used eventually leaked water into the mechanical/electrical components and rusted the interior, so now washing is a little bit more tedious (always having to turn the toothbrush downwards, etc).     The toothbrush&#x27;s action is fine, though - it provides great cleaning and it isn&#x27;t really *that* noisy.</li>
    <li> My family has used Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes for years.  We end up replacing them after about 3 years or so, but, at a price under $20 each, it still is cheaper than a Sonicare.  The replacement head brushes are about the same price as the more expenseive rechargeables, and we purchase them at Sam&#x27;s and on line.  And, in the end, the results are what matter.  No one in our family has had a cavity in over 7 years.  Some of that has to be the results of a good toothbrushing (especially with my children).</li>
    <li> seller canceled order with no reason.  Stay away from shifty 3rd party amazon sellers</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself and one for my 14 year old son.  We both love it and the timer is a great thing for both of us, especially him!  The toothbrush pulses at the 2-minute time.  This toothbrush really makes your teeth feel clean and works great compared to a regular toothbrush. I charge it about every 4-5 days, just to keep it going really fast.  My son leaves his on the charger.  Both ways are fine so far.  we have been using them for three weeks or so.</li>
    <li> My previous (dentist prescribed) electric toothbrush failed after about one year use.  So, after doing some research, I purchased the Oral B Precision.  For the money I didn&#x27;t expect much. But to my surprise, the Oral B cleans better than the dentist version.  I really like the timer feature.  I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> I had been getting my teeth cleaned every three months when the hygienist recommended that I buy an electric toothbrush. So, I bought the Oral B mainly because of its low price and the reputation of the company. There were several other brushes I could have bought. It&#x27;s strange how well this brush works. It does make a little noise but it is not unpleasant. It is easy to operate with the on/off buttons. I like the brush itself because it is smooth and soft and I even found &#x27;extra soft&#x27; replacement brushes from this company. The whole thing--brush and recharger unit -- are inconspicuous and can be tucked away near an outlet. I now go for a professional cleaning only two times per year and the hygienist smiles a lot. She says that this brush has kept stains from forming and removes plaque and other gunk very well. I&#x27;ve saved myself some real money with this brush.</li>
    <li> Works fine but could be a little slower.  Rattles your teeth if you aren&#x27;t careful.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Never owned one of these electric jobs before. Could not believe how good it felt and how clean my teeth felt and looked. Hated brushing my teeth before and now I will look forward to the experience. Never wanted to spend the money before but now they are at an affordable price point. Why not have 2 and get all the different heads for a real professional clean?  &lt;br /&gt;Everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush to keep on the first floor of my house in order to brush after meals. I also own a Sonicare Elite toothbrush. For $100 less, this toothbrush definitely works. It doesn&#x27;t notify you to change every 30 seconds, but it does have a 2 minute notification. I&#x27;m used to my Sonicare 30 second intervals, so timing is pretty easy. The brush head that came with the brush is a little too big for my liking. It&#x27;s tough to squeeze it between my teeth and gums in order to brush my gum-line. The brush has good movement and gets the teeth and gums clean. I definitely prefer the Sonicare, but this is a nice inexpensive spare brush to have around. I&#x27;d recommend it for a spare, but not for a primary brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Oral Bs $100 Professional Care Toothbrush and this $20 brush beats it hands down. It has more power, stays charged longer and actually feels sturdier than the ritzy $100 brush. I&#x27;ve had my Vitality for over a year and it is working good as new. The expensive brush crapped out the first week I had it.  This is really an excellent brush, regardless of price.</li>
    <li> The same product is availible from Target for $ 17.98. You ultimately save on the shipping and have a return facility as well. Good value for money either way.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of this item because prices were all over the place for similar products. I tried this one (very reasonable price) and I am delighted. It works great, light weight, easy to use and holds the charge well. So far so good.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both have been using this toothbrush and its predecessor for 10 years.  When the battery finally dies after 5 +/- years, we just buy a new one.  Now on our fourth.</li>
    <li> This power toothbrush is to replace our previous one.  We have used the Oral B for many years and it seems to cut down on our cavities.  The price was very reasonable and we are very satisfied with our purchase.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Vitality is a great electric toothbrush.  I have been using electric toothbrushes, beginning with a much more expensive Philips Sonicare toothbrush, for several years.  After I broke two of the Sonicare toothbrushes (probably by pressing too hard on them), I bought the Vitality because it was the cheapest electric toothbrush around.  To my surprise, I found that it works much better than the Sonicare did.  The Oral-B Vitality has a small round brush which can get into hard-to-reach areas and to hard-to-reach surfaces that the large brush on the Sonicare couldn&#x27;t.  Also, the circular motion of the Oral-B Vitality works and cleans much better than the back-and-forth motion of the Sonicare brush.  After I switched to the Oral-B Vitality my dentist was surprised at how clean my teeth were!  You can get Oral-B electric toothbrushes with wide a range of features and at a wide range of prices, but I found that the low-cost Vitality serves me well.  You can also get a range of different types of brushes for the Vitality.  The batteries of cordless electric toothbrushes eventually wear out (after several years, depending on use), but replacement of the low-priced Vitality is also affordable.  I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these, one for myself and two as Christmas gifts.  I love mine..it is smaller than most brush heads, and fits my mouth better.  I love the rotating brushes rather than the pulsating ones..my teeth feel cleaner.  I am able to get way to the back teeth for a good cleaning.  I own several very expensive tooth brushes, and also a waterpik, but this is my favorite...and very inexpensive.  My little 10 year old grand-daughter loves hers that I gave her, and also my 35 year old daughter.  This is a great little toothbrush, very small and compact.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Oral B power toothbrush has worked efficientlly so far and we are quite pleased with it</li>
    <li> I wanted to shop around for an electric toothbrush because, despite my best efforts to brush at least twice a day and floss, I still felt like my teeth weren&#x27;t getting clean enough.  My battle involves bleeding gums, which requires that much more cleaning power in between your teeth in order to get rid of the bacteria that&#x27;s keeping them inflammed.  The Vitality brush does a pretty decent job of reaching deep into the surfaces and the spaces of your teeth to get them clean.  Licking my teeth, they feel pretty smooth, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is recharged with an adapter unit.  Remove it from the base, put on your toothpaste, and turn the unit on.  The agitation has a little bit of splashback to it, so minimize it by brushing the back of your teeth first and then moving to the front; then the outside surfaces, then the inside.  Also, the brush head is fairly small compared to standard brushes.  I thought it was a little distracting at first until I started brushing to pay more attention to individual teeth rather than sweeping broadly across them.  Finally, I thought the timer was a digital read-out; your brush will vibrate a couple of short pulses to let you know that two minutes is up.  It was disorienting at first.  I thought the brush was out of power, but I figured it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a solid investment, and the good thing is that it&#x27;s relatively affordable and still an effective device compared to more expensive powerbrushes on the market.</li>
    <li> First rechargeable electric that I have owned and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I don&#x27;t know if the more expensive models offer more value but I can&#x27;t imagine that they clean any better. The 2 minute timer is handy, comfortable to hold, teeth feel clean when finished. Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good product.   Shipped and delivered quickly an on time.    Charged the product as instructed.   Product works great.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this electric toothbrush. Very easy to use and does a much better job than non-electric toothbrushes. Price is surprisingly low for the quality and I really don&#x27;t see why it would be necessary to buy a more expensive model.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love the fact it does not overcharge, and can be left on the charger. Feels powerful on each use. Leaves my teeth feeling clean, and do not feel like I need to brush for hours or use a great deal of pressure when brushing.</li>
    <li> Works great, especially for the price. I have this an a Sonicare and I think they both work well, but this was a lot less expensive and tends to accumulate less yellow junk on the charger, so I dont have to clean the charger as much.</li>
    <li> This Oral-B electric toothbrush is both inexpensive and an excellent performer. Hands down beats manual brushing for getting teeth clean quickly and effectively massaging gums.</li>
    <li> I pay this bruch near 20 dollar just 2 months ago, now i see cost as low as 11.  Get it ! amazing value for what you getting, pretty powerful brush, might not entire replace a regular brush, some area still i prefer using regular brush, but most area can easily cover with the power toot brush, the best feature it has a timing of 2 minutes, not many has that feature. However you need to somehow figure a way to cover the brush, cause it doesn&#x27;t come one.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral B Vitality D12513 Precision Clean Power Toothbrush]]  Just as good as the expensive ones.  I was replacing one that was about 7 years old, and it works great.</li>
    <li> Great brush at a great price. Just like the one I had that finally wore out. The 2 minute timer is a great option. Ray</li>
    <li> Requires 16 hours charging before use.     Once charged, delivers a powerful and consistent brush action.    Pulses after 2 minutes brushing.    Only minor problem is that the package contains only one brush head - thus the low price.     Easy to find inexpensive brush replacements if you look around on Amazon.     I&#x27;ll probably replace my brush head every 3 months.     Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Was going to spend more on another brand but decided to give Oral B a try.  Just the right size, battery holds adequate charge, timer works great, makes my mouth and teeth look &amp; feel spectacular!  The handle is small but works for me since I have small hands.  Gets in all the nooks and crannies no problem.  Also works in the shower.  I love brushing my teeth now.  Add flossing and a mouth rinse &amp; your dental checkups will shine!  Can buy 5 more and still come out ahead.  Thanks Oral B!!</li>
    <li> Oral-B Vitality is the first rechargeable electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s simple and effective.  A great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Even though he already has a more expensive Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush that he keeps in the medicine cabinet, I bought this inexpensive electric toothbrush for my husband - one that he could keep in the shower (I&#x27;ve always liked having the option to brush my teeth while taking a shower).    I asked him how he likes this new toothbrush and he says it is really great.  In fact, he says he somewhat prefers it to his other rechargeable toothbrush because this one has a really comfortable brushing speed and is easy to hold onto.    Thus, it is a nice inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush and at this time he would recommend it.  However, we haven&#x27;t had it long enough to determine how well the battery lasts.  The other Oral-B that he he&#x27;s had for years (probably 7-10 years) is still amazingly working well with the original battery; yet that toothbrush was probably over $50 at the time.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is unsatisfactory.  Bought one on Amazon and after 4 days it did not work--Dead.  Called P@G for warranty.  Nice person--sent a replacement.  Lasted 2 days.  Discussed with P@G again.  Offered to ship it back, offered to pay more for a better model.  Was told that they would refund and did.  Beware.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m replacing an older version of the same brush - it lasted for YEARS with no trouble, but finally was having trouble holding a charge.  I don&#x27;t know who buys the $90+ models while this one is available.</li>
    <li> This works much better than a manual brush. It feels like you just had a teeth-cleaning at the dentist every time you brush. It also seems to reduce wear on gums. I&#x27;m not sure why one would purchase the more expensive models; this one does everything you&#x27;d want an electric toothbrush to do.</li>
    <li> These people shouldn&#x27;t call themselves \\&quot;buy for less.\\&quot; This product is $25 in store at Bed Bath and Beyond.    It&#x27;s a great product though. It really gets into the hard to reach areas at the back of the mouth. After brushing your mouth feels pretty clean. My dentist recommended this toothbrush. He said it was the best out there along with colgate Total toothpaste.    Don&#x27;t forget to floss.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for the exact one I have had for 10 years or so.  My dental cleanings are a breeze since there is almost no plaque build up.  My gums have also improved.  Don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles of the other models.  Bought through Amazon with free shipping.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> designed-in obsolescence and &amp;#34;buy all new to replace&amp;#34; concept If the NiCad battery does not hold the charge....</li>
    <li> Its cheap and is great for cleaning behind those wisdom teeth. I wish the battery life was longer than 5 days though. Replacement heads are easy to find and cheap as well.</li>
    <li> Compare to other electric toothbrushes, I got mine at a great value of $15.90 back in March 2009. The best part is that it is still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want a fancy electric brush, just one that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> we have been very happy with the product, even though the one we bought kinda stopped working,  but after contacting braun (with the number given on the toothbrush) the thing was replaced within a couple days,  no hassle, and has been workin well ever since..thumbs up, bright smile :)</li>
    <li> I have resisted buying electric toothbrushes for quite some time because of the price.  \\&quot;My manual toothbrush is working just fine, and I rinse with an anti-cavity rinse after brushing,\\&quot; I told myself.    I went for a year without dental insurance.  When I went to the dentist, He told me that I had the beginning stages of gum disease, and a potential cavity.  At that point, I thought I&#x27;d try spending $20 to avoid the much higher cost of cavities and gum disease.  I selected this brush because of the high rating and the reasonable cost.    I had my semi-annual checkup yesterday, and my mouth is now much healthier.  The concern for gum disease is gone, and I don&#x27;t have a cavity.  The only thing I changed is the type of brush I used, so I credit this brush to better health.    I have not noticed a loud noise or a warm handle in using the brush.  The timer is a great feature (apparently, I brush my teeth for too long).</li>
    <li> This works really well - although it cost less than $20, it seems indistinguishable to me from one I used to have that cost close to a hundred. One great advantage of a power toothbrush is the built-in two-minute timer - I suspect just brushing longer probably makes a big difference in your dental hygiene, even without the power aspects. When we got away we find we miss brushing with it!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  If you have problems with your gums receding (like I did) because of agressive brushing with a regular toothbrush, you should get this toothbrush. It&#x27;s fantastic!  I will never go back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve got this product on time they promised ,which is good ,and it works very good. Toothbrush needs to be replaced earlier than they advertize ,but don&#x60;t mind it at all.</li>
    <li> I got this after the dental-hygenist asked me if I used a power toothbrush. Her question was a hint, not a compliment. After some searching, I decided that for the price, what did I have to loose.     I did in fact loose something - the crud on my teeth! Now, every night my teeth feel as smooth and clean as they do after a professional cleaning. I even notice that flossing after brushing with this toothbrush is easier, as much of the easy / large bits are already brushed away.    I used to dread brushing at night, but this makes it easy to do a good job when tired (the instructions say not to press or rapidly brush side to side). The included 2 minute timer also keeps you on track.    Battery lasts a great 4-6 day time, and then I charge overnight again. I only use this once per day, so your time may be lesser if you use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I owned an Oral B toothbrush for more than five years before the battery finally would no longer charge.  The new brush I purchased is an exact replacement and my unused brushes fit perfectly.  My dental checkups are great and I hope to continue using the new Toothbrush for the next five years.</li>
    <li> Easy to care for, quick to recharge; has all the features necessary for good oral hygiene. The timer is a plus, as is size ( no storage problem with this compact unit). Good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this approximately one year ago when it was only $16.99. It worked well... much better than regular (manual?) toothbrushes and my dentist noticed a difference. I like that it signals after 2 minutes of brushing time since I tend to not brush long enough otherwise. Maybe that&#x27;s why my dentist noticed a difference.    The toothbrush broke after about 9 months of use. No biggie for a toothbrush that was less than $20. However, as I am writing this review the toothbrush is selling for $40, which makes it not worth it anymore. I have since upgraded to the \\&quot;Oral-B 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush\\&quot; which I also ordered from Amazon. It&#x27;s priced at $48 and I would definitely recommend spending that extra $8. The \\&quot;Oral-B 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush\\&quot; feels like it has more rotations per minute, and just feels much better in general. I am going to assume that it will last me more than 9 months as well.</li>
    <li> It is a good product that I can use for two things: A tooth brush and a facial massager.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is just as good as the Sonicare one it is replacing, and for a lot less money!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 toothbrushes over a year ago they both are still working great. My husband and I now have better cleanings at our dentist. This brush has a 2 minute timer the recommended time to brush. I have purchased the replacement brushes at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond but the dentist has them for sale also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a great brush!  Took off one star because it comes with a small head, while the green one comes with a regular toothbrush kind of head.  I didn&#x27;t realize this and I ended up buying a regular head which added to the cost.    I have both, blue and green, and they both work well.    The only issues are:  - It&#x27;s a NiCd battery which means it&#x27;ll have the memory effect  - If the battery dies, you have to wait at least 8 hours before you can use it, so either keep it charged all the time, or have a backup brush.    (If it matters to you:)  For whatever reason, the blue one is made in Mexico and the green one is made in Germany.  The heads are all made in Germany.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  I was skeptical at first since it was really cheap but I must say, I&#x27;m VERY impressed with this brush.  This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it.  I can&#x27;t stand brushing my teeth the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; way anymore lol    Get it!  It&#x27;s cheap and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush but where do you get refills.  I can not find them anywhere and they are so expensive.  they cost more then the tooth brush alone.  so if anyone has an idea please let me know  jongale64@comast.net</li>
    <li> I just buy the cheapest Oral B rechargeable toothbrush.  The first one I had lasted about 8 years and so I bought a second one.  I don&#x27;t have any gum or mouth issues.  I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would buy a $100 toothbrush when a $20 works just fine.  The secret?  BRUSH YOUR TEETH!  I floss at night before going to sleep.  I brush twice a day.  Because this brush has a timer, I brush for a full two minutes (don&#x27;t leave the water running while you brush!).  I feel like a powered toothbrush does a more thorough job than a regular toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t leave it charging all the time.  It shortens the life of the battery.  I put it on the charger when it gets slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this unit has been replaced with the flossing action version.  Get one or the other and brush often!</li>
    <li> Great size for traveling.  Makes brushing a little more fun!  On/off mechanism is not very sensitive.</li>
    <li> I like the feature of the 2 minute timer on the toothbrush and the cost is inexpensive.  I&#x27;m not sure of the value of the brush since it lasted me a year and ten months.  I am debating on buying another one.</li>
    <li> This is a good electric toothbrush, but all the replacement heads I&#x27;ve purchased since have been defective.  The lose a small metal pin and then the head bobbles about.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush in January and also one for my daughter. By early summer we both noticed a strange metallic taste and the toothpaste in our mouths was gray instead of white. Black drops started coming out of the handle and it became clear that metal from inside the handle was mixing with the toothpaste and getting into our mouths. Other than this problem I thought the device was great but this is just not acceptable so I am buying a different brand.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my old electric toothbrush that died.  I had spent quite a bit of money on the other one and it lasted a couple years.  To my delight, this one does the same job as the other.  This gives me the same results and saves some money.  Gotta love that.</li>
    <li> Per dentist&#x27;s recommendation, I started using this and the results are very impressive. My teeth are visibly cleaner than they used to be with manual brushing. Even though I took utmost care during manual brushing, but still can&#x27;t beat the advantages of the precision cleaning around the teeth &amp; gums. As an experiment, I ordered [[ASIN:B000GBID0M Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush (Colors May Vary)]] and then used [[ASIN:B000X6IUY4 Oral-B Precision Clean tooth brush refills, new package, 7 ct]]. And I found that the Precision clean is definitely better than the Dual Clean in terms of cleaning the hard-to-reach areas. However, life of Dual Clean is more than the Precision Clean. (And either of them is better than the manual brushing anyway)</li>
    <li> I wanted a second brush for my downstairs bathroom so I could catch the kids before they went to school.  This is a great little brush for the money, it even has a two minute timer built in.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Works very well. A little noisier then some other models I&#x27;ve owned. I have no idea what a two hundred dollar electric toothbrush can do for you but this one works just fine. The timer is a nice feature. My only real complaint is that I like to see the rechargeable batteries replaceable because once the batteries die so does the toothbrush. I usually get about two years out of one before the batteries stop recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 9/30/2010. It&#x27;s been over three years and it&#x27;s still working great. The motor is just as strong and the battery still holds a good charge as the day I purchased it. Same with the unit my wife uses. Just thought you&#x27;d like to know.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Oral B electric toothbrush for about five months now and have had absolutely no problems with it.  The fact that it comes with a compact charger is certainly an advantage as I only need to charge it about once a week so the charger stays in the cabinet and out of the way.  Another advantage is the fact that the entire brush is completely waterproof so taking it along with me into the shower is not a problem.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone interested in purchasing their first electric toothbrush.  It is both affordable and easy to use.  For the price, nothing else can beat it!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Just as good as the more expensive Oral B models and at a fantastic price! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush replaced and earlier Braun model with which I was satisfied.  I am just as pleased with this model although it has a simpler charging stand without storage. It does the job as promised and is just as simple to use.  I would recommend it.  The price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Always buy Oral-B electric toothbrush, but this Vitality Precision Clean is worth the money. The name says exactly what it is.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Oral B through Amazon.com at a great price!! I had my doubts that this would work as well or have the quality my other Oral B had...I was amazed. The brush works great, holds a charge, and is small enough so it does not take up alot of room on my vanity. I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> My Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush performs better than expected. This is my second Braun electric toothbrush, the frist one, 11 years old, finally died. The new one has more power and does an even better cleaning, my dentist can attest to that. The  price was unbelieavable and well worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush for 22.00 USD - The shipping was great as usual from Amazon, free with the prime service and I received it in a little under two days. That aside, I&#x27;ve never used any other electric brushes before and like most my family have hung onto the manual-brush train with the hopes that the prices on these would go down. Well, the price has gone down, and the difference between a standard brush and an electric brush (at least in this case) is fairly impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my very first use I was quite surprised at how much my gums bled, that sounds a little disgusting, but it means the brush was scrubbing harder than I was originally use to. This is a good thing, as after a few weeks of use I can honestly say my teeth feel cleaner and my gums no longer bleed, even when I floss. The two minute timer is also a neat feature, and ensures that I&#x27;m not just guesstimating my time and brushing the full length morning and night. The recharge station is easy to use, and I&#x27;ve yet to experience any problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great deal, does not take up much space, looks decent, and if you&#x27;re looking to move up from a manual brush, you really can&#x27;t beat the bargain price and functionality of the Oral-B Precision. It just works!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is simply amazing.  It is electric.  Not only is it attractive but it is fun to use.  I get excited every time I put it in my mouth.  I eat my meals in haste so I can go brush my teeth.  I have, on occasion, brushed my teeth again without having eaten anything.     I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> It gets deep and down under the gums and cleans really well!!! I love it!</li>
    <li> i wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order this item again if necessary.  i would, however, purchase this item for use with batteries and not the rechargeable kind (takes up outlet space that i need for other items).</li>
    <li> Yes , oh yes , Finally !!! , a toothbrush that cleans your teeth real clean and for that price , its just brillant !  Love it , my teeth never felt that clean before . Highly recommended . Thanks Oral B and thanks Amazon for featuring it .</li>
    <li> A very effective toothbrush, and it even makes brushing enjoyable! Somewhat loud, but no louder than your average electric brush. The feel of the grip is very comfortable and fits nicely in your hand. It is true what they say: it does actually feel like you just went to the dentist after you use it. The timer is a clever feature and encourages you to brush for at least two minutes. The recharging station takes up very little space and keeps the brush ready to go at all times. The brush and recharger even look cool! For the price, it&#x27;s really a no-brainer. If you care about your teeth, and are familiar with the pain of getting cavities filled, you will not regret purchasing one of these. My teeth have actually gotten whiter after a few months of using this brush, and my breath never smells bad! It&#x27;s always nice when your dentist compliments you on your teeth, and I&#x27;m a former smoker.</li>
    <li> We have several other Oral Bs, which cost a lot more than this basic unit, which we got for an occasional granddaughter visit.  Although not quite as hefty in the hand, this economy model appears to work as well as the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Surprised that the brush lets you know when to stop.  Everone should have one.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a much more expensive model brush by the same company that I used for about 3 years before the non-replaceable battery died.  Happy with the basic product but not thrilled at the sort-of-short lifespan,  I opted to buy a less expensive model by the same company ($12 vs. about $50).  Guess what?  Except for the lack of a short 1-second pause in brushing action every 30 seconds to tell you to move on to the next brushing quadrant, I don&#x27;t feel or see any difference.  The battery keeps a charge for at least 3 days of brushing so it&#x27;s good for weekend trips (the charger is very small so extended trips are not an issue).  What a bargain at $12.00.  Rather than a throw-away quick fix, I am very pleased with this model highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned in 7-8 years, and is by far my favorite.    I did love my Interplak brushes, which came recommended by my dentist as having the best cleaning action, but they were not durable (hence \\&quot;brushes\\&quot; and not \\&quot;brush\\&quot;). They say the key to getting an Interplak to last is to not use toothpaste, just dip the brush head into some Listerine. Sorry, but for me that wasn&#x27;t a satisfying brushing experience.    After two Interplaks died, I moved on to Sonicare. That brush is more durable. My husband is still using it. But when I went to the dentist and told the hygienist who cleaned my teeth that I used a Sonicare, she said that must be the reason my gums were bleeding. In fact, she said pretty much every patient she sees that has bleeding gums is using a Sonicare. I don&#x27;t think she means that no one can clean their teeth successfully with that brand of brush, but apparently it fails a lot of people.    I did find the Sonicare to be a very tough toothbrush to use because of what I&#x27;ll call \\&quot;the splatter factor.\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t brush some areas of my mouth very thoroughly without spraying toothpaste everywhere. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I had to change my shirt after brushing in the morning. Because it was difficult to maneuver, I probably didn&#x27;t brush my gums the way I should have.    So, my dentist recommended a Braun / Oral B brush. Initially, they recommended a brush that cost more than $100. It had all kinds of bells and whistles, including a digital display that you could affix to your mirror which would tell you how well you were brushing. I decided to first try the Braun technology with this super-affordable model, partly because of my experience changing brushes over the years, and partly because the Oral B web site claimed the exact same plaque removing power (I think 97 percent) for every single brush they offer, regardless of price.    This model has absolutely NO bells or whistles. It doesn&#x27;t even have the standard LEDlight on the handle to show you when it&#x27;s recharging. It just has one button that turns it on and off. That&#x27;s all I need.    A couple of key differences between the Sonicare and the Oral B brushes:    1) With this Oral B brush, I can use REAL toothpaste.    2) The entire brush head rotates, not the individual brushes. For me, this is more comfortable. It also takes the splatter factor down to about zero.    3) Both brushes have a 2-minute timer, but whereas the Sonicare shuts off after two minutes, this Oral B brush gives a pulsing signal at two minutes and then keeps going. For me personally, this is preferred, because I rarely finish brushing in the two minutes allotted. When I&#x27;m done, I hit the power button.    4) The standard brush head is smaller than some. That is by design -- you brush one tooth at a time rather than sweeping the brush across your teeth -- but some might prefer something with more coverage.    It&#x27;s been several months. My gums are healthier and the battery is going strong. I just bought an additional Vitality brush for my preschool-age son, who&#x27;s finding it very manageable.    My one real complaint is the same one I have had about every electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned, which is that you have to remove the brush head  and rinse off the brush mechanism after each use. If you don&#x27;t, you get a raunchy build-up in that area. I guess there must be something that requires the brushes to be engineered this way, since it&#x27;s the way all the manufacturers make them. Just be aware of this as you care for your brush.     BOTTOM LINE: You aren&#x27;t going to beat the value of this brush. It&#x27;s outstanding technology at a terrific price (and the Amazon price is $3-5 less than what you&#x27;ll find at retailers).</li>
    <li> While the replacement brushes are not cheap, this toothbrush does the same job as models costing 3 times more. Since the batteries on rechargeable brushes&lt;br /&gt;tend to last only about 2-3 years, i would consider this a wish purchase.&lt;br /&gt;P.K.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my grandchildren ages 6 and 9. They love them because they make their teeth feel so much cleaner. Mom and Dad like them because they&#x27;re convinced that their teeth are cleaner and healthier.  So Mom and Dad went out and bought their own.[[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral B Vitality D12513 Precision Clean Power Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> Does the job well, I can feel a difference in my gums after I use this vs. a regular toothbrush. The one I bought from Amazon.com broke: you have to be careful not to drop the brush or hit the head of the brush on anything. The head of my brush started coming off and eventually came off completely (it fell in the sink once and then it just started getting looser and looser). The good thing was that Oral B sent me a new one, free of charge, after I called them. I&#x27;m being more careful with my new one, and so far so good.</li>
    <li> Excellent looking product with a wonderful cleansing action from the brush. This is the 3rd Braun toothbrush I have owned over many years and would thoroughly recommend them for reliability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral B tooth brush for more than 5 years.  Of course, I&#x27;ve tried sonicare and other electric tooth brush; however, I like oral b more.    For the price of $20/each at walmart, I replace my older tooth brush with a new one every 6 months or so.  This might sound like a waste of money since they are brush heads available; however, 1) brush head is $7.50 each 2)battery is irreplaceable and weakened greatly after 6 months.  Brush head last pretty long, I brush twice a day and about 5-8 minutes each time.     This model is especially good because of the price, and it also cleans really well.  My teeth are squeaky clean &amp; no cavity.     For $14/each, i&#x27;ll stock them up!</li>
    <li> It was a present from me to my husband and he is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush and clears much better than the traditional ones!  I&#x27;ve had it for only about one month. So far so good!! Nothing to complain.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a much more expensive Oral-B model that we lost on a recent vacation. Surprisingly, this one cleans just as well. In fact, its lack of high-tech scrubbing motion is a plus for me; this brush doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s forcuing my jaws apart. If you really need an LCD screen on your toothbrush, spring for the more expensive version, but if you just want clean teeth, save your $80.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m throwing this in the garbage (unfortunately the return window closed already) - must have been made in China, metal taste/gray metal bits exit holes in head and get mixed in with toothpaste. Get a pricey item like Sonicare - doesn&#x27;t have this issue since parts are made with quality materials.  I&#x27;ll probably be getting a Sonicare now.</li>
    <li> I replaced a Sonicare with it.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased, does much better cleaning than I expected!!&lt;br /&gt;Definite good buy, holds a good charge!!</li>
    <li> This brush is easy to  use, timer is very helpful.  i have had great reviews from my dental hygenist since I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B.  It&#x27;s priced right too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who was leaving for college.  He says it works just great.  He was happy with the toothbrush and I was happy with the price.</li>
    <li> From the very first use I fell in love. Money well spent. I would suggest that you just click BUY BUY BUY. Probably a $100+ toothbrush would work better who knows... I am sure nothing close to this cost can give you such great results. Wonderful Product.</li>
    <li> Oral B is definately a good provider of dental care products. The oral B vitality is a great product that you can order additional brushes with for changing as often as needed. I tried the ones for gentle or sensitive and they work great. My teeth are so clean feeling and definitly whiter since using this product</li>
    <li> The small round shape of brush is perfect for my teeth. That was the primary reason I chose this item.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush, and especially so considering the low price. It works reliably, charges well and runs smoothly.  The heads are easy to remove for cleaning and the motor isn&#x27;t too loud. An economical and efficient purchase. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Works very well, the replacement heads are kind of expensive.  I use it on the few teeth I have left.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun electric toothbrush I have owned. While I am happy with the way it cleans my teeth I am extremely disappointed with permanent gradual unsightly blackening of the rubber grip part of the handle. Proctor and Gamble say that this part of the toothbrush is not covered by the warranty and is caused by not drying the toothbrush properly after use although I do this. I believe that the raised lines in the rubber make it difficult to dry properly and that a hard plastic handle would be preferable. In my view the materials used for the handle which is an integral part of the design do not stand up to normal bathroom use. When I emailed a reply to P&amp;G I received only a request to complete a customer survey. I was not impressed and would avoid buying another toothbrush made with this material.</li>
    <li> I have always brushed too hard and my dentist recommended this one and he was right.  it is great</li>
    <li> Until a year ago, I never liked the idea of owning an electric toothbrush: I&#x27;d owned several cheap ones and never liked any of them. Then I figured that I&#x27;d try one again about a year ago and so I chose the Sonic Spinbrush by Arm &amp; Hammer. I chose the Spinbrush because it had a large brush, which I thought meant less time/effort brushing my teeth.  The Spinbrush worked pretty well, but the large brush head gagged me horribly. Because of this, I decided to give the Oral-B Vitality a try and I like it much better. The first reason I prefer the Vitality is because it has a much smaller brush head (you don&#x27;t need a large brush with an electric toothbrush, since the toothbrush is doing all the work.) The smaller brush head also allows me to reach places the larger Spinbrush cannot reach, because it&#x27;s too big. The Vitality is easier to maneuver in your hand as well, thanks to the smaller handle base.  Another thing I didn&#x27;t like about the Spinbrush is how it would click off automatically after 2 minutes (I don&#x27;t think all models of the Spinbrush do this, though.) The Vitality purposely sputters after 2 minutes for it&#x27;s timing function, but then continues it&#x27;s normal operation after a second or two. I still find this annoying, but at least I don&#x27;t have to remove it from my mouth, dripping with toothpaste, just to turn it back on. And if I finish early, the Spinbrush required me to punch the button twice to stop it (again, something not easy to do with a vibrating toothbrush in your mouth), whereas the Vitality only requires a single button push. These two things alone make the Vitality much more convenient.  I also think the Vitality is more powerful then the Spinbrush. The reason you had to push the button on the Spinbrush twice was so you could use it at a lower speed if necessary, but I never found that necessary at all. I prefer the more powerful Vitality, because it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning better by not slowing down if I push too hard.  About the only thing I liked better about the Spinbrush was that it had an indicator light on the base to tell you it was receiving power (I think it gauged the charge, too, but that was never a problem for me.) I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s even important, but it is something I tend to prefer with rechargeable items. Other than that, I love the Vitality and I much prefer it over the Spinbrush. Now I can brush my teeth without gagging and I am thankful for that.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric toothbrush for the money.  Most electric toothbrushes cost much more but this one works great and you don&#x27;t need to give an arm and a leg to get it.  Will definitely buy another one.</li>
    <li> having no problems at all.Keeps your teeth very clean and helps without having to do alot of flossing later.</li>
    <li> My family has several different Oral B electric toothbrush models. All give us that just polished feeling that one gets at the dentist! I prefer the models that have the 2 min auto timer, as it encourages spending that extra time to get all surfaces clean. The electric unit and timer are particularly useful for young children and older folks who may be suffering with limited hand dexterity due to arthritis and sore joints. I have given up manual toothbrushes forever and even take the Oral B when I travel. A full charge will easily last a week.     I have noticed the children have fewer new cavities when they use their electric Oral B. It also promotes healthy gums. Although we were able to share one base unit with our own individual brush heads at home, each child was sent away to college with a new electric Oral B to maintain that dentist visit polish every day!     Of course the unit and brush heads cost more than a manual brush, but for sparkling teeth, fewer cavities, healthy gums, fresher breath--a real bargain!</li>
    <li> I got this from Amazon for a few dollars less than retail, which is always nice. I saw it at Safeway the other day for about $20, and even at that price, I think it&#x27;s well worth it. Nobody likes brushing their teeth. It&#x27;s just one of those little chores that has to be done, and with the Precision Clean Power Toothbrush, it&#x27;s not such a chore. It&#x27;s very efficient and cleans the teeth faster than a conventional brush. AND, the head is so small, you can reach into those little nooks and crannies and between the teeth more effectively, and that is really nice. My teeth feel cleaner and I am more motivated to do this little chore several times a day. I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This Oral B is as good as any other electronic toothbrush you are going to buy and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, price of product very good, shipping cost was slightly higher than usual. Works very well, charges up overnight and does not over charge. It might oscillate a little bit faster than my old one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush 6 months ago after my first visit to the periodontist, when I was told that some of my pockets had turned into \\&quot;5\\&quot;s (I&#x27;m fairly young, so this was not a good turn of events). I&#x27;d used a sonicare toothbrush in the past (over $100 for the model), and I hadn&#x27;t noticed a major difference - still got cavities same as ever, so when it died I went back to a manual toothbrush. Anyways, I just had a check-up after 6 months of faithfully using the oral-b electric toothbrush, and my 5&#x27;s were down to 4&#x27;s. Not to mention that my teeth feel noticeably cleaner after using this brush, and the 2-minute timer ensures that I do brush for a full 2 minutes (which I never did with a manual toothbrush). I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the far more expensive Braun/OralB Triumph toothbrush which is the top of the line model for around $100 from a local store. After taking it home, I realized that most of the advanced features such as the wireless LCD screen were kind of gimmicky. I returned it and based on the reviews here, purchased this Vitality model for around a sixth of the price. After using it, I noticed that there is absolutely no difference in the toothbrush mechanism and I am positive that both this and the much more expensive Triumph model give the exact same results. The only downsides i noticed were that this model lacks a charging indicator and it uses the slightly older NiCad battery tech. Also, if you travel internationally and need a multiple voltage charger, you may want to spring for the more expensive model because this one doesn&#x27;t have that capability. For me, this wasn&#x27;t an issue and with the money saved, I could probably stockpile enough replacement brush heads to last me a loooong time.</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush uses the same brush heads as Oral B&#x27;s more expensive products, yet the price is very low.  It looks to be well-built, and it works just fine.  After trying it, I bought another one for my son.  He has difficulty brushing due to his braces, so I bought him the heads made specifically for that.</li>
    <li> Good brush expect brushead is a little small, Power cord for the recharging dock is short, about 2 feet, and a full charge takes 16 hours or so. Other than that the brush gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This brush works as advertised. I really like brushing my teet with it, and it&#x27;s helping my gums get healthier. I can&#x27;t really hear the TV well unless I turn the TV volume way up, &#x27;though I think this is the same for all electrical brushes. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the charge. I like that it tells me when 2 minutes have gone by brushing.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good electronic toothbrush with reasonable price, this is your best choice. Clean well and comfortably, Good Price.</li>
    <li> Die Zahnbuerste ist total klasse. Hatte sie mir als Reisebuerste fuer den USA Urlaub bestellt. Sie ist total handlich, super leise und der Akku haelt sehr lange. Ich wuerde sie auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen.</li>
    <li> Everything about this was great. The price, fast shipping (received in 5 days), and the toothbrush works great and has excellent quality with a 2 year warranty. I give it 5 stars here!!!</li>
    <li> Oral B Vitality D12513 Precision Clean Power Toothbrush is clearly one of the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. The charger is even portable, which means if packed properly I can even take this with me on trips! The handle is easy enough to grab onto and it fits comfortably in your hand. The timer that indicates you&#x27;ve been brushing for two minutes is very helpful for me because I tend not to watch the clock when brushing! SMILE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the toothbrush should be changed every three months; I plan on changing mine every two months just to be extra careful with my teeth. In addition, this toothbrush DOES get hard to reach areas inside your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer comments that the brush is noisier than they were expecting. It does make noise but in my opinion it&#x27;s not very loud at all. Don&#x27;t let this deter you from buying this toothbrush. Oral B makes high quality dental products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is one toothbrush I intend to use for quite some while to come. I love that it&#x27;s portable and overall it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy the $60-$100 OralB toothbrushes, stick with this basic, cheap, and effective one.  This works as well as the big guys, but is so cheap you can buy 2 or 3!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, and I absolutely love it. Took this with me on my 4 day weekend getaway to California, and it held a charge for the entire time (I brush twice a day). My teeth feel cleaner and I actually enjoy brushing now. I highly recommend the Oral B Vitality to anyone who is on a tight budget that desires a top notch product.</li>
    <li> I have Oral-B&#x27;s for everyone in the household.  I really like the product and needed one for travel.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for a fraction of the price of other electric toothbrushes.  No regrets on this purchase!</li>
    <li> nice product, it make my kid enjoying brush his teeth.  And it&#x27;s  also rechargable.</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush!  It makes my teeth feel much cleaner and I am no longer brushing too hard, which was causing my gums to recede.  My dentist recommended this brush and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product has restored my faith that some companies are ethical.  They know how to make excellent products at descent prices.  This product has exceeded my expectations in every way possible.  When I use it I actually feel like I just left the dentist office.  I have noticed that my teeth are noticeably whiter and more healthy after using the product and I frequently hit the 2 minute timer because this product is addictive and fun to use.  I have used Sonic tooth brushes before this and have found their electric tooth brushes to be utterly useless.  I even ended up throwing away my $129 sonic tooth brush.  This brush not only cleans well, it can be easily cleaned, and can be easily upgraded with different attachments.  I am anxious to try the floss head soon as I hear it is also well rated and does the job it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  As stupid as this sounds... thanks Oral B.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful brush, with spin power! It cleaned better than my 6 yr old Oral B ultra and that was $90 back then so this one I spend $15 (with coupon and special) bought two, one for me and one for my wife. So it was free shipping. What a deal! Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush, but the one he recommended cost $100, so I didn&#x27;t buy one.  Then I found this one for $15.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive models, and don&#x27;t put off the purchase because of the prohibitive cost.  The electric brush does do a much better job, and this one works fine.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my wife....she raved so much about it, I decided to also buy one...good quality product that we both enjoyed....We both wish we would of purchased  these years ago.....Amazon price was 25% lower than local stores. also got free shipping by spending more than $25.00 total purchases. Very fast shipping....</li>
    <li> I was not an electric toothbrush user, but this Oral-B has surprised me and made me a confirmed user.  Thorough, reliable and effective.  I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Has a strong motor and cleans very well. Time will tell how long it holds up (a different model OralB fizzled after a year).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for approx. two months now, and i honestly feel a difference as opposed to regular manual brushing.  Not exactly top of the line, but gets the job done.  One thing about it, not necessarily a bad thing, but the handle gets really hot when you leave it on the charger, it claims it is impossible to overcharge, but it heats up, real well.</li>
    <li> Good product so far....have only used it once but seems to work fine. Very good price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(update) 2012 ....Still working...;)</li>
    <li> It seems fine and is replacing one like it, another Oral B product.  I think my old one had a little more pep.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a $200 Oral B Poower Toothbrush set, which came with two brushes and a nice stand/charger.  After two months with the Vitality, the only significant difference I can see between the two brushes is the Vitality lacks the 30 second intermediate timer that prompts you to move on the the next quadrant of your mouth.  For a $160 savings, I&#x27;m finding a way to suffer through without that functionality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kindof obsessive about keeping my teeth clean..I brush at least 4-5 times a day..I&#x27;ve never even concidered an electric toothbrush before until I started have some gum issues and someone suggested to me that a rotating electric toothbrush would clean down in the gum line better than a regular brush..So I did some research and this one was rated very high and the cost was small so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot..  I&#x27;ve had it about 10 days now and my gums are almost back to normal !  (I&#x27;ve had this painful problem for a couple of months)  My teeth feel so clean I can&#x27;t believe it ! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was the replacement for dead battery earlier version of the same tooth brush; however, this one has timer on it.  I was obviously not brushing long enough before. Now my teeth feel and look straight from the dentist office.  Even using it for three weeks impressed the hygienist, much less plack build up for her to deal with.</li>
    <li> The charge on the toothbrush last for a few days, unlike some others I have used. Very good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing too hard with my regular toothbrush so my dentist recommended an elctronic one.  He said don&#x27;t buy one with all the bells and whistles as you don&#x27;t need it.  He was right.  My wife and I use this toothbrush and we are very happy with it.  It has the 2 minute timer which is key and now makes us focus on brushing instead of walking around the house doing two other things...  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush. My dentist told my I was brushing too hard manually and cutting grooves in my enamel. With this unit I don&#x27;t need to use as much pressure to feel clean. I can&#x27;t wait until my next check up to see how I am doing. I like the 2 min timer.    PA Biker</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a battery powered toothbrush for several years but wanted to get one that was rechargeable so I didn&#x27;t have to keep changing batteries. This toothbrush is almost exactly the same as my non-rechargeable one except it has a one additional great feature:  the 2 minute timer really helps you make sure you&#x27;re brushing long enough.  Plus the fact that it doesn&#x27;t slow down over time like the non-rechargeable ones.  I feel like I&#x27;ll get a better more consistent cleaning since the battery is always charged up to the max.  This is a very basic toothbrush but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2, one for the wife.  It is everything we expected.  New to the rotary motion of this one, past one was a vibrate method.  I like the holder/charger, easy for on and off while your hands might be wet.</li>
    <li> Save your money.  I have had 2 of these.  The first one worked for a week before is suddenly stopped working.  I bought a 2nd one thinking &#x27;how bad can it be twice in a row?&#x27;  I found out.  The 2nd one never ever worked.  I know it was only $20, but Oral can&#x27;t make something that works at all?  This is the worst product I ever purchased.  What is worse is that there are only 2 customer service centers in my state and both over an hour drive.  Look elsewere for an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Why on earth did they modify the physical shape of the interface between the brush and the charger from the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; fitting on earlier units?  Maybe there&#x27;s a technical reason that is not obvious but the change precludes using earlier charging bases that provide for brush storage.  The brush unit itself is fine and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> We originally started using an oral-b at the recommendation of our dental hygienist. Our last oral-b lasted 10 years, but eventually started turning itself on in the middle of the night.  We wanted another oral-b but didn&#x27;t want to spend the $80 at Costco.  I wasn&#x27;t sure why this was so much cheaper, but figured we wouldn&#x27;t be out by much if it didn&#x27;t work.    I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity at this point but it seems to work just as well as the more expensive oral-b.  I&#x27;ll update this if it breaks in the next year or so.  Update:  It&#x27;s now been almost 2 years, with 3 of us that use it and just change out toothbrush heads.  That is now 6 person-years of use and still going strong</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush daily for 5 1/2 years and it&#x27;s as good as new. I&#x27;ve had 2 other Braun rechargeable toothbrushes which were much more expensive. This one is just as effective and powerful. The 2 minute timer is very useful as well. I&#x27;d like to comment on some reviewers charging problem. Since the battery is a NiCad so if you remove it from the charger before it&#x27;s completely charged it can&#x27;t be charged fully UNLESS you let it run down to nothing and recharge from there. The replacement brushes are expensive so I bought CVS replacements. That was a mistake, I&#x27;m back to the Braun made brushes. My dentist comments about how well maintained my teeth are now, in fact he has lengthened the suggested time between checkups.</li>
    <li> Im very pleased with this toothbrush. Its cheaper, Fast, Very portable, and does the job well.  Just put this on your teeth and let it do the work for you.  You get that smooth dentist feel on your teeth every time.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this wonderful toothbrush at Amazon on April 4th 2009.  It started to not charge fully about six months ago.  So as time went by it became less and less useful.  Unfortunately Amazon no longer sells it, but to my delight, I found it today at Walmart priced very reasonably!</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush for the price. I have used Oral B for many years and this is one of the best so far and again at a GREAT price.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this brush.  Don&#x27;t confuse this with the dual brush - that one I didn&#x27;t like and threw away.  This single rotary brush makes my mouth feel like the dentist just cleaned my teeth.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the $100+ brushes but this one feels like it does a pretty good job.  My only real complaint is the bristles are much stiffer than my normal toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using OralB brushes for 7 years and they&#x27;re great; this is my second one; I&#x27;ve had it for three years (the other I&#x27;ve had for 7 and still works!). Battery&#x27;s amazing; lasts for a really long time without keeping it plugged, as I brush often during the day. It&#x27;s a really great pick given its electrical prowess and unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> How did I go so long without owning an electric toothbrush? I always thought they were pricey, so I was surprised to find how affordable this model was. My boyfriend&#x27;s dad is a dentist, and this was the toothbrush he gave him when he started developing sensitive teeth. I was skeptical, the last thing I thought you would want to do is give your teeth a good scrubbing when they&#x27;re already sensitive. Now I&#x27;m no professional, but from personal results- my teeth are feeling better and it&#x27;s amazing how clean they are!! Almost like having gone to the dentist for a deep clean. I wouldn&#x27;t substitute this for regular visits to the dentist though. I highly recommend this. Totally affordable (although the replacement tips can be $$$), but for what it does... it&#x27;s worth it!!!!! Do it!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this toothbrush for about a month now and I am very happy with the way it works. I find the two minute timer buzzer most useful, as it enables me to brush sufficiently without overdoing it as I did earlier. I love the fact that it is rechargeable since I have stopped using many older electric toothbrushes as soon as the battery runs out. It is not too bulky, making it convenient to carry on trips as well. My only complaint with this brush is that it stains my countertop with the water left behind after rinsing the brush after use. Overall, I would recommend this to someone looking for an inexpensive rechargeable electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth wih oral-b for over 10 years now, and they are all similar to  the vitality model.  I&#x27;ve  always used the least expensive model since I see no difference from the expensive ones, unless you are looking for \\&quot;extras\\&quot;, like timer, lcd screen, etc. The vitality is a very good brush. I use the round head instead of the elongated.  I rather brush my teeth with oral-b than any other eletric brush on the market. The sonic kind hurts my gum and it tickles a lot as well. Oral-B, and their  entry level eletric brushes are the way to  go. I can&#x27;t brush my teeth with regular toothbrush anymore. Brush heads are cheaper on ebay but I found out they don&#x27;t last as long as those you buy at grocery stores around $20 for 3. I buy the precision clean brush  in bulk  on ebay for around $1 each. They last a good 2 months. The ones at walmart/amazon and such last 3 months or more. The bad  thing about the vitality rechargeable and all the older  oral-b I own is that you need to  recharge it after 3-4 days of 2-3 daily brushings. I think this is annoying. I didn&#x27;t want to leave the brush recharging after every use. So I bought the ORAL-B Pro-Health that uses two AA batteries. It is simply AMAZING. The quality is the same as the rechargeables, but it is even better. The batteries lasts forever on the pro-health. I put 2 rechargeable AA (2000 MA) and the thing kept  going and going without a noticeable lack  of power for a good 2 months. It is the best.  The vitality rechargeable brush gets very slow after 3-4 days. Not with the pro-health. Buy the  pro-health. It is the way to go if you like this kind of ORAL-B design. Another thing is ORAL-B equipment lasts forever. I only have one eletric brush where the original rechargeable battery died on me. And since they are the entry level brushes, I just buy another one of  the same. No need to buy another battery.  Again, go with the ORAL-B PRO-HEALTH eletric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. The best thing about it is that it produces circular vibrations for cleaning, which is close oval type motions thought to be best moving for not only cleaning but for the health of tooth.</li>
    <li> I have used Oral B products for YEARS.  In fact, the last electronic brush I had lasted for at least 10 years.    When it failed to operate one morning recently I was heartbroken!  I thought I would try a manual brush but was sorely disappointed.  I have been extremely happy with my new brush and love the 2 minute warning it gives - I realized I had not been brushing long enough before.      My teeth feel so clean now - I love my new brush!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these and the item seems to shut off for 1-2 seconds here and there.  Both toothbrushes do this. i still use them but I just wish they wouldn&#x27;t shut off like something inside isn&#x27;t wired right</li>
    <li> I have resisted getting an electric toothbrush for years, but I finally broke down at the suggestion of my dentist and my periodontist.  I&#x27;m getting used to it now and love it.  It does a great job cleaning my teeth!</li>
    <li> My dentist even commented on how clean my teeth are after regularly using this toothbrush.  There is a remarkable and noticeable difference between this toothbrush and a manual brush.</li>
    <li> Machine works good, but should have focused on the brush size.  Little too&lt;br /&gt;small for efficient cleaning.  Bigger brush next time.</li>
    <li> Price was about 1/2 less than what I could find it for locally. It was a replacement for an older oral B product and performs similar. Only complaint is the new version charger base no longer has a compartment to store extra brush heads.</li>
    <li> At less than [...] bucks, this is a good deal. It works as well as our older, more expensive model, and is much smoother and quieter, and feels faster. The only negative point is the lack of a wall mount or pass-through plug.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these on Sept 23, 2009. One for my wife and one for me. Recommended by my dentist who said it should be as good as more expensive models.   At first, my wife had problems with her unit holding a charge but it seems to be running OK now. However,two days ago while rinsing my unit and cleaning the brush under the faucet my power unit simply quit. I tried recharging it but all I get now is a little whirring sound but no action of the brush.  I think the Braun Oral-B should hold up a lot longer than that, even at the low end price. I&#x27;ll probably end up tossing it and purchasing a highly rated higher end Braun model.</li>
    <li> I got it last August and it worked fine until it died yesterday.  Maybe it can not be recharged anymore.</li>
    <li> This great little tool not only works to clean your teeth, but it cleans a lot of other things too.  I use it to clean the water line in the toilet, the grout in the shower, my belly button, toe and finger nails, and all kinds of other things.  My wife enjoys it too.  After all this, it still cleans my teeth as clean as can be.&lt;br /&gt;  This little gem would make a great bingo prize.</li>
    <li> My hygienist recommended this brush for a beginning brush.  I love the way it cleans my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like I went to the dentist each time I brush.  I don&#x27;t know if I would be willing to pay&lt;br /&gt;much more for a brush when this one works so well.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for someone who is looking for a cheap entry into electric toothbrushes.     A combination of switching to an electric toothbrush and flossing more regularly has helped me clear up my moderate to severe gingivitis.     The two minute timer is a great features.    I&#x27;ve only had this for a few weeks, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it will hold up, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> These Oral B toothbrushes are all great and I was thrilled to grab a couple here for under $14 each with free 2 day shipping. Arrived partially charged and ready to go. Wish I&#x27;d ordered more to have for spares.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush was exactly as promised.  It works equally as well as the one I used to have that was much more expensive. Also, it is smaller and does not take up as much room on the counter.  I recommend it very highly and the price was extremely good.</li>
    <li> Still working after many years service. Braun rules</li>
    <li> My old oral-B died after many years of service so I replaced it immediately with this one.  Just what I wanted. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The tootbrushes are exactly as advertised. They are very light on your teeth, the brushes glide over your teeth. No need to press down hard when brushing. I made the right choice when I bought these.</li>
    <li> I am not that happy about this after I spent 30 dollars for a discounted Philips Sonicare one. This one is like a toy and have no way to clean out anything from your teeth and waste money and time.</li>
    <li> Good buy and I love the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Bought new and the battery would not hold a charge even after 48 hours of charging. I could not even finish brush my teeth even once before it failed. Also, the battery got hot- not warm, but hot.</li>
    <li> It is okay, but spend a little more money and go for the Oral-B Precision 1000.  A better tooth brush with a better clean</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for myself. And I liked it so well I had my wife try it. Then I bought another one for her. Works great.</li>
    <li> This is an A+ toothbrush. It has a timer, which is convenient. It lasts a long time, and my dentist recommended it. And it isn&#x27;t too noisy. It&#x27;s pretty attractive as far as toothbrushes go.    If you have a tiny apartment without an outlet in the bathroom, I would recommend getting the same model with batteries instead of a charger. I switched to a battery one and it sounds crazy, but you don&#x27;t even have to change the batteries twice a year, and it makes the toothbrush more portable and you can bring it to other countries.    I&#x27;m still giving this toothbrush five stars, because there was nothing wrong with it at all. But people with small bathrooms who frequently visit other countries should get the battery-operated one.</li>
    <li> Very durable and does a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> Needs just a bit more power</li>
    <li> I enjoy and still enjoying this cleaning sensation.  Recommend it to everyone.  Now I have a cleaner/healthier mouth and smile!</li>
    <li> this is my first power toothbrush, and i&#x27;m lovin it, easy to use, really clean up the corner teeth inside out well.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. If you&#x27;re not used to using an electonic toothbush then it can take some getting used to. At first it felt a bit rough on my teeth and gums but afer about the third use I really started to appreciate how clean my mouth felt. This toothbrush seems to do a real good job and a very reasonable price. I can&#x27;t tell you how it compares to the expensive powered toothbrushes but I can tell you that, in my opinion, it beats the heck out of manual brushing. The  main reason I say this is because there are times when I wake up and I&#x27;m really sleepy and spend two minutes with the toothbrush without making much of a difference At least with this brush even if your sleepy and barely paying attention, your mouth will still get a proper brushing. The only things that I thought would be nice accessories to this toothbrush are  1.) a longer cord (it&#x27;s only about 3 ft long)  2.) something to cover the brush with just in case it falls over and to make it easier to travel with (Of course you can always improvise)</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush about a week ago and ive already thrown it in the trash. The head on the brush hardly moves, it feels like its just vibrating more then anything else. I dont understand how others think this is a good brush.....</li>
    <li> This is the best tooth brush for your money. My teeth felt so clean after using this brush than they ever have with a manual brush.</li>
    <li> Could not be happier with my OralB.  Great price, performs well and the timer is a big plus.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is almost perfect. My teeth always feel great afterwards. Sometimes my gums are a little soar after changing the head, but that only lasts a few hours.    I have noticed that the bottom of the toothbrush can be a bit messy. I run it under the water and put it on the charger, but the bottom of the base &amp; sink gets messy, not matter how well i rinse it. The very bottom of the toothbrush also gets a tiny bit crusty.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son 3 months ago.  It will no longer take a charge.  Can&#x27;t recommend this product if it only lasts 3 months.</li>
    <li> Purchased this model Oral-B toothbrush due to specific recommendation by a dental hygenist.  Before, I used a manual brush and had tried a cheap battery powered breifly.  The Oral-B&#x27;s automatic 2-minute timer is a help to ensure fully cleaning my teeth.  I have used it for a coulple of weeks now and am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who has braces.  I love that it cleans his teeth and the braces well.  He&#x27;s had great responses from this Orthodontist.  I also like the fact that the heads are inter-changable so eventually, we can switch them out without replacing the whole thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a person who&#x27;s always had excellent dental history and great teeth so I was surprised on my last routine cleaning to see that heavy calculus had built up. After mentioning that I&#x27;d been using a Sonicare, my dentist immediately told me to switch to this toothbrush, claiming that it&#x27;s a far more superior brush and a great value. Right after that visit I walked straight to Walgreens and bought one. Since then I&#x27;ve noticed a BIG difference in how much cleaner my teeth are. After doing some research I understood why the Vitality was so much better than Sonicare... the only method of brushing that is more effective than using a manual toothbrush was using one that brushes in a circular motion. With the Vitality you can really clean behind your teeth and reach all the way back to your molars very effectively; which I could not with Sonicare. I went in today for a routine cleaning and my teeth were looking great! For the quality and value of this toothbrush, it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love our new toothbrushes.  The timer is helpful so you know you have brushed them for the right period of time.  Also the brush head is the right size so you can reach every tooth, front and back.  My teeth have never felt this clean.  Plus I am using less toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted with the right price. No fancy feature but good enough.</li>
    <li> I started using this toothbrush at the recommendation of my dental hygienist and I love it.  I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush for two years and just finally replaced it.  It wasn&#x27;t replaced because it stopped working, though its battery life off the charger is pretty bad now, but I just wanted an upgrade.  This is a great, no frills toothbrush to use when switching from manual to powered toothbrushes. Beware of the adjustment your gums undergo during the switch, which is why this is a good starter because the head spins much slower than my new 3000.</li>
    <li> I think your teeth feel so much cleaner and its easy to use. My favorite part is not having to buy batteries just plug it in. Keep it clean to avoid corrosion.and calcuim build up since its used with water. I alternate with a regular toothbrush just in case they hit different surfaces, now if only I could find a product to floss my teeth for me I&#x27;d be set</li>
    <li> Wow, I bought this in 2008 and now, five years later am still using it. It works great, especially on a full charge. Just change the brushes every three months. I charge it every other days and it provides good power to activate the brush. Have less cavities than hand brushing, and leaves fresh clean feeling each brushing.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
    <li> it does the best job to keep my teeth xxtra clean ,recommend this product above the other very overpriced products,unfortunately cannot be bought from here anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful user of Braun Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes for about 5 years.  This brush does a great job just like the brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I like the 2 minute timer.  This feature is typically not available in their entry level brushes, but this one has it, and I found out quickly that I wasn&#x27;t brushing for nearly long enough. (now I am)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle on mine does not even get warm when it is charging...and I have never seen this issue with a Braun Oral-B brush...doesn&#x27;t sound normal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this brush has more vibrations per minute than my previous Braun Oral-B brush.  Since I have been using these brushes I haven&#x27;t had a single cavity, and often get comments at the dentist about how there is almost no work for them to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy the brushheads off fleaBay for a lot cheaper than you can find elsewhere, and everyone in my family has a Braun Oral-B brush in some form or fashion.  I highly recommend this brush.  Why wouldn&#x27;t you spend $16 + maybe another $10 annually for brush heads to insure a healthy mouth and a beautiful smile?</li>
    <li> Had one for 2 years, and it died of a dead battery.  Got another one and it lasted 1 year and now will not take a charge.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great product. Cleans teeth flawlessly, has average battery life and looks great in your bathroom. Brush-refills are a bit expensive though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Oral B electric toothbrushes for 20 years, and this is the best one yet. It has more power and it holds a charge better than any of the previous generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take it on business trips, and it is plenty strong to do the job even after a full day of travel and not being plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it a 5 if there were some clever means to attach the charger to a wall. Also, I&#x27;ve only had it a few months, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the battery life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several prior versions of this toothbrush; this is an improved model. Small charging base uses little space on the vanity. Easy to grip with tapered, rubberized handle. Small brush head helps get into tight areas. Timer helps ensure proper amount of brushing. Brush refills are widely available. Great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this tooth brush for 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I&#x27;m a \\&quot;hard-brusher\\&quot; and I tend to bleed from my guns occasionally. This brush is very gentle on the gums, and I&#x27;ve yet to bleed using it. In fact, my teeth have never felt so clean before.    There are so many different brushes available out there, and they can get very expensive. I&#x27;m not sure what a $200 brush can do different than this one. It can&#x27;t get much better than this. So, I highly recommend this to all!</li>
    <li> I worte this toothbrush following the advice of my dentist.  At the beginning I was a little skeptic about the effectiveness of it, but after the first week I got used to handle it (at the beginning the spinning head annoyied me a little and my gums were aching a little) and now I use it every day. I think it improves the effectiveness you brush your teeth as the head is much smaller than a traditional toothbrush and, hence, it is easier to reach the some parts of your mouth, plus.....it is even less tiring than using a traditional toothbrush. I am very satisfied ot it and the price I got on Amazon was so convenient. I suggest everyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I switched to an electric toothbrush.  My teeth feel so much cleaner after brushing!  This is the only electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others.  What I don&#x27;t like so much is that it&#x27;s a bit loud and makes my nose tickle when I use it because of the strong vibration.  What I like is the affordable price and that the battery charge lasts long enough to use your toothbrush for a few days without putting it back on the charger (like if you go on a short trip).  You also use a lot less toothpaste.  It also tells you when 2 minutes is up so it gets you to brush more effectively.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral B Vitality D12513 Precision Clean Power Toothbrush]]    This toothbrush is great.  It does just what I expected it to do and a little more.  It has a built-in timer that lets you know when you have brushed your teeth for the recommended two minutes. I like that.  It makes my teeth feel as clean as if I had gone to the dentist.</li>
    <li> This Oral B Vitality electric toothbrush is a lot better than the previous Oral B electric toothbrush I had that finally went bad after about 10 years use.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the point of paying $100+ for a good electric toothbrush.  This one works great.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Took a chance and bought 4 Oral B Vitality (the price was excellent). Have 2 teenage sons that don,t like to brush. At their last not so stellar dentist exam it was recommended electric toothbrushes. Received them a month ago and they really do work great. We all agree it gives that \\&quot;just from the dentist clean feel\\&quot;. And the boys have even given me kudos on the choice. At first I felt the head was a little too small. But after a month of use we like the size because you have to concentrate on each tooth and thus gives you a better cleaning. The power and speed really does feel like a dentist tool. Never realized how long 2 minutes can be. Will buy these again, but order extra brushes because you will be cleaning your teeth more thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Low cost, circular motion, long-lived battery makes this electric toothbrush a winner.  Compared to the Sonicare that it replaced,it&#x27;s a much better product at about one quarter of the cost.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Even after leaving it to charge for more than 24 hours, brush does not last more than 40 secs.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both ordered Oral-B toothbrushes about four years ago. Although I&#x27;ve since gone with another brand of toothbrush (on my dental hygienist&#x27;s recommendation because of a certain type of gum problem that I was developing), I used the Oral-B for several months, and my wife has only recently replaced hers, due to the battery no longer holding a charge, but it lasted more than three years, which is very acceptable for such an inexpensive toothbrush. We were both very pleased with the Oral-B in every way. My wife replaced the brushhead every few months, and that was the only maintenance required.</li>
    <li> Oral-B products are always good.  What makes this one stand out from the pack is the two-minute timer that changes the speed momentarily to let you know that you&#x27;ve been brushing the minimum two minutes.  The price is reasonable (although replacement heads don&#x27;t come cheap).  Still, in the war for good dental hygiene this is a formidable weapon.</li>
    <li> Great for the price and they do a good job they charge well and they hold their charge a long time.  IF you want a good electric tooth brush this one is great.</li>
    <li> This is a basic \\&quot;no-frills\\&quot; electric brush. Works as described. You cant go wrong with a price under $15.00 for this brush.</li>
    <li> After being scolded by the dentist one-too-many times that I wasn&#x27;t brushing in circular motions and that I haven&#x27;t been giving my wisdom teeth enough attention, I recently decided to jump onto the electric toothbrush bandwagon, but at the same time, I had no desire to spend half a truck payment on one with \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; cleaning or five-way floss/torture heads. Over the past month, I&#x27;ve found that this Oral-B Vitality, which is actually manufactured by Braun and bears a small Braun logo, cannot be beat for the money! It does just what I need it to, has a nifty compact recharging station with no exposed metal contacts, and my mouth hasn&#x27;t ever felt cleaner.    The only two very minor cons that I think people should be aware of are related to battery life and the two-minute timer. It&#x27;s probably true that the battery will last 20 minutes between charges, but I&#x27;ve found in daily use that if I don&#x27;t hang it back on the recharging station after every other use, the bristles spin a bit slower than they do when the battery is fully charged. Not a huge deal, but my time is precious in the morning and I want maximum RPMs, so I prefer not to completely empty the battery beyond the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation to do so periodically. Also, I can see the two-minute timer being great for those who have a bad habit of not brushing long enough, but I find personally that I typically brush for about 2-1/2 minutes, even if I&#x27;m trying to rush, so it would be nice to have a way to turn the two-minute timer off. The timer isn&#x27;t a light or a beep, but rather the toothbrush \\&quot;revs\\&quot; its engine down and back up a few times once two minutes have elapsed, which makes brushing ineffective over the course of those one to two seconds of revving and thus again wastes precious seconds. Again, not a huge deal, but a way to turn it off would be nice. Otherwise, this toothbrush can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t afford a toothbrush in the triple digits, then this little guy is a powerhorse for your buck. Power toothbrushes are soooo much better for your oral hygeine than manual toothbrushes and the oral b Vitality Precision Clean has a small head, so you can actually get around the back of the teeth, and you&#x27;ll get that \\&quot;slick, just out of the dentist&#x27;s chair feeling\\&quot; all over again.</li>
    <li> While this toothbrush does what it is supposed to do and the 2-minute timer is a nice addition, the design is flawed. It is impossible to brush your teeth with this brush without drooling all over the place. I believe it has to do with the width of the brush attachment. Brushing your teeth with this toothbrush is quite messy, no matter how hard I try, and I would not buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for years.  Using this is much better than brushing manually.  It is significantly lower in price than some of it&#x27;s competitors but just as good.  Heads can be changed.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> had this same one for 7 years. love this thing! i&#x27;ve traveled with it without the charger at times and to my memory, a full charge lasts me at least 3 days! it&#x27;s slim and attractive and really the whole things is quite portable for travel as well.  i like how well priced it is as well as the prices for the replacement bristle heads.  and honestly, i&#x27;ve had the same bristle for years and it quality has only moderately degraded with time. the machine component/handle works as good new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, if you are good about actually brushing your teeth for as long as you should - your teeth get pearly white within a week or less!</li>
    <li> I have been using this tooth brush for over two years now and it is still going strong. I will definitely buy another one in the future.</li>
    <li> mine has been going for years now.  Well worth the cost</li>
    <li> Really too loud!  It has a small head on the brush to it takes longer too.  I keep it at work for emergencies.</li>
</ol>
