      <li>That site also has a lot of other natural hair products for more than reasonable prices.</li>
      <li>It can also be used for braids or twist and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>but why is the cost so high?  </li>

<li> A little goes along</li>
<li> I usually also use my spray bottle of water, a leave-in conditioner and Organic Root Stimulator Softening Lotion every other day before using this product.</li>
<li> and I was a little nervous</li>
<li> product at SamsBeauty online for HALF the price!</li>
<li> It has a subtle smell (you will barely smell anything)and does not leave any build-up behind.</li>
<li> and I bought this because my usual jamaican lime gel was sold out.</li>
<li> this product does not meet my expectation, too expensive for such poor quality.</li>
<li> Use this gel, you will not be disappointed.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t flake at all, but Amazon&#x27;s price is totally outrageous! :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I went with this product because the Mango and Lime product wasn&#x27;t available at my local beauty supply store. I saw the reviews and I was a little nervous but I went with it out of desperation. I am so happy that I did so far so good I started my locs today with this product. My hair is soft yet tangles easily and is so unmanageable in its natural state. (Shrinkage, tangles, matting, flaky scalp, dry scalp, sensitive to products, you name it!) My hair just ate the product right up and my two strand twists are held firmly yet look so elegant. I followed up with a water, jojoba oil, tea tree oil, and lavender oil spray mix so hopefully that will prevent flaking. A little goes along way so I suggest not pasting it on. I will update when I do my first retwist!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m now a month natural and transitioned for 4 months. I used this product for kinky twist and now plan on using for styling my own natural hair. It doesn&#x27;t flake at all, but Amazon&#x27;s price is totally outrageous! :( I could get this same 13 oz. product at SamsBeauty online for HALF the price! Just thought I should warn people. That site also has a lot of other natural hair products for more than reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> I have natural shoulder length dreads and I bought this because my usual jamaican lime gel was sold out. This stuff does not do a very good job holding when I retwist my dreads. My hair starts getting real frizzy like 2 days after I twist them with this stuff, not so with other products.</li>
    <li> I really like twist and loc gel, this product is non- Flaky, has a pleasant smell, very light texture and has a nice hold to it. I use it when re twisting my locs and it has a nice sheen to it when I get from under the dryer.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my hair. It has not left any buildup in my Locs so far and it dries really quickly.</li>
    <li> This works great for my daughter&#x27;s dread locks!</li>
    <li> I bought this gel to use on Double-strand twists. My hair is soft, very curly, and frizzy so after the second day this style looks like I had the twists in for a week already after daily moisturizing. Using this gel holds my hair better without the hard, crunchy hold that most gels have. It has a subtle smell (you will barely smell anything)and does not leave any build-up behind.I usually also use my spray bottle of water, a leave-in conditioner and Organic Root Stimulator Softening Lotion every other day before using this product. Products from Organic Root Stimulator are really good anyway for natural hair girls because it goes to the source. Use this gel, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with locs and I&#x27;ve been using this product ever since I started them over a year ago. This gel smells great (almost like coconut), dries clear, holds for a longs time when used correctly and moisturizes. It can also be used for braids or twist and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something to use in my hair for twist outs and braid outs and I&#x27;ve tried so many gels and puddings out there. This is the one that works for me. It has no alcohol, very little buildup (my hair absorbs a lot of the moisture) and great hold, especially when I go under the drier for 10-15 minutes. THe best thing is it really \\&quot;stretches\\&quot; my hair unlike the Ecostyler or other gels that give me a \\&quot;shrunken &#x27;fro\\&quot; lol</li>
    <li> Thank you so much I&#x27;m starting my dreadlock and this hold my hair pretty good</li>
    <li> While I did not buy this product from Amazon, using this cause white flakes and no holding power on my locs I will not buy this product again!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s a great product but why is the cost so high?  I pay $3.99 for each tub-same size.</li>

    <li> I use this for creating two strand twists and for smoothing my hair into updos. This gel hold well, doesn&#x27;t cause a ton of buildup, plays well with other products, has a light and non-intrusive smell, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy, and is a great price for the amount you get. I have used many other gels and custards at various price points, and didn&#x27;t get the results I get with this product.</li>
    <li> This gel provides a very nice and soft hold. I would suggest that you use it with a moisturizer because it doesnt do much for nourishment.

    <li> I love this I use it in my hair and my daughter uses on her natural hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my locs because it had rave reviews. I will NEVER use this again. I&#x27;ve used several different products to twist my hair and have never had such flaking, immediate flaking, with any other product. Never, again, back to Mango Lime</li>
    <li> This twist gel is perfect. It is very gentle on the hair yet holds the twist in place and does not make them stiff like other gels I&#x27;ve tried. You really don&#x27;t have to use that much and it also smells great!</li>
