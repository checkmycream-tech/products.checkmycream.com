      <li>I would buy it again to be used with L&#x27;Oreal curl activator products which worked great but were a little drying because I needed to use it also a lot because of the hot weather and the humidity.</li>
      <li>OMG, this is my absolute favorite hairstyling product and my inability to find it locally (until someone told me it&#x27;s being closed out) did not make me happy.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have a scent and some people may actually like that better.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a new formula and doesn&#x27;t work the same as the old formula and they&#x27;ve added a scent, strong scent to it...</li>

<li> This product goes on slightly sticky, but as soon as it dries, and I pick or comb my hair, it is SOFT and CURLY</li>
<li> Keeps my curls in check and keeps the frizzies down to the bare minimum!</li>
<li> but I am a little upset that the manufacturer used to sell this product at local retail stores for YEARS , up until last year for $3.99 a bottle.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other name brand curl products and NONE have given me the same results as FX Curls Up.</li>
<li> but I can tell it&#x27;s not exactly the same.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a hard residue on your hair and makes your hair soft and extra curly.</li>
<li> Works on either wet or dry hair.</li>
<li> it was slightly oily but after the scrunching product  I needed additional oil back into my hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder for me to find it in the stores</li>
<li> Just a little goes a long way</li>
<li> The tops on all three were not screwed on tight.  </li>
<li> and I think it is a little stronger smelling.</li>
<li> Almost every one makes my hair like a football helmet when it&#x27;s dry, or is sticky enough to mend broken dishes!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really sure what this stuff is.  </li>
<li> Unable to locate in stores now</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought the 3 pack.</li>
<li> I was so disappointed.  </li>

    <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years! It doesn&#x27;t leave a hard residue on your hair and makes your hair soft and extra curly.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel for wavy/curly hair ever....no crunchy curls with this. I think  I have found my HG in this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the same stuff. It&#x27;s a new formula and doesn&#x27;t work the same as the old formula and they&#x27;ve added a scent, strong scent to it...ugh! I&#x27;m sorry I bought the 3 pack.</li>
    <li> Excellent for curly hair</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Brings out the waves without making them feel greasy or crunchy.</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;FX Curls Up&amp;#34; for 5 years or so now.  I love this stuff! Leaves my hair with beautiful soft curls.  Just a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t put too much in your hair because it will feel weighed down and not as soft.  Unable to locate in stores now so thank goodness for Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I Love this product. My curls are better without being frizzy or stiff.</li>
    <li> this stuff is best for my thick curly hair and i have tried just about everything</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for years and it is my absolute favorite.  It helps control but leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> THis products works great but I am a little upset that the manufacturer used to sell this product at local retail stores for YEARS , up until last year for $3.99 a bottle. Last year they pulled it out of all the retail stores and started selling it online for $7-8 a bottle!! Whats up with that?????? THEY DOUBLED THE PRICE !</li>
    <li> Keeps my curls in check and keeps the frizzies down to the bare minimum! Wish I could find it in my local store</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 19 years and it&#x27;s the only thing that gives me great curls without leaving my hair feeling dry or crunchy. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder for me to find it in the stores so I was thrilled to see Amazon was able to find it. I&#x27;ve tried other name brand curl products and NONE have given me the same results as FX Curls Up. Plus my boyfriend loves the way it smells!</li>
    <li> I have tried about a hundred hair gels for curly hair.  Almost every one makes my hair like a football helmet when it&#x27;s dry, or is sticky enough to mend broken dishes!  This product goes on slightly sticky, but as soon as it dries, and I pick or comb my hair, it is SOFT and CURLY and I love it!! If I re-moisten it, it works again!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product,it works very well with me,love it,I will continue buying it,thank you so much.makes hair beautiful,won&#x27;t weight hair down,I just wish it would go back to its original price.</li>
    <li> My lady loves it i need more she loves the way it curls and defrizz her hair thank you sg.blaze</li>
    <li> it was slightly oily but after the scrunching product  I needed additional oil back into my hair. It smelled good but you did have to use a lot of it. I would buy it again to be used with L&#x27;Oreal curl activator products which worked great but were a little drying because I needed to use it also a lot because of the hot weather and the humidity. But when going to a cooler climate this worked well by itself. It could be used by itself but you would have to use a lot depending on your hair type and the weather. My hair is soft fine and has  natural pattern like a jeri curl when wet, so while hair is wet use this product which will lock it your natural curl patter and curls.</li>
    <li> Easy order and delivery.  Not as good as the original.  It does not de-frizz the ends as well as it used to and I think it is a little stronger smelling. Still one of the best products I have found and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Looked all over for this product. So glad Amazon had it. I will be ordering more soo. Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t put tape over the bottles so they all exploded in the box. So each bottle is only about half full.</li>
    <li> OMG, this is my absolute favorite hairstyling product and my inability to find it locally (until someone told me it&#x27;s being closed out) did not make me happy. Surprise me! when I found it on here at such a wonderful price! I hope to buy more soon to stock up if you have it cuz the thought of my curls feeling like straw, as it has with all other curly-hair products, is not acceptable!</li>
    <li> Awesome to keep curls looking good! Use with the spray.</li>
    <li> Best product for naturally curly hair! Very lightweight and really defines the curls. I have been using this over 10 years!!!</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed.  I love this product but can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  I bought the three pack figuring I would stock up.  The bottles arrived in a ripped plastic bag and were leaking all over the place. The tops on all three were not screwed on tight.  There were different amounts of product in each bottle.  The product has no scent at all.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like the original.  I had a tiny amount left of the bottle I had and compared to be sure.  The texture is the same but still I was wondering what I was putting in my hair.  My curls came out pretty good but I can tell it&#x27;s not exactly the same.  I miss the great smell it had.  I&#x27;m not really sure what this stuff is.  However, I will use it because I&#x27;m now stuck with three bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New UPDATE:  I have to say I have been using the product and although it doesn&#x27;t smell like it used to the results have been good.  My curls come out the same as they used to.  I think because it was leaking all over and had different amounts in the bottles I was a bit put off.  I would say anyone who liked the old version will still be happy.  It just doesn&#x27;t have a scent and some people may actually like that better.  I don&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from buying it because I amusing it and I am happy.  It was always my favorite curl product.  If you are thinking of buying it don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite hair gel.</li>
    <li> The best hair product ever!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! It works great without leaving my hair feeling like I have lots of product on it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores and I was so worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it again.  This is the best curl definer and defrizzer I have ever found.  Keeps hair bouncy and not crusty or greasy (as long as you don&#x27;t use to much).  Works on either wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I have naturally curly hair &amp; have been using this product for years.  I love that it gives me a soft, natural look.  It tames the frizz, defines my curls, &amp; does NOT make my hair crunchy. Oh, and it also smells good. If you have curly hair I definitely recommend trying FX Curls Up defrizzant.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for my curly, frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
