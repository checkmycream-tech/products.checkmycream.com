<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Honestly, this has really helped me. I am writing this review to really help people like me. I am a 33 yr old female with very long, curly hair. Last year, I had a horrible time with severe scalp itching and tiny pimples right on the very front of my hairline. At the time, I didn&#x27;t know what was going on. The area was very red, itchy and smelly. Ewwww!! I have never had a smelly/zitty scalp!! This was very disturbing to me. I consider myself a young/attractive female, so loosing my hair is not something that I am willing to deal with. I know it isn&#x27;t okay at any age, but last year at age 32 I was not ready to handle hair loss. After much research, I figured out that I had folliculitis. I went to my Dermatologist twice...total waste of time and money!! He tried to tell me that it was just age related hair loss. He said &amp;#34;Wow! It looks really red and irritated, but I think it&#x27;s just female hair loss.&amp;#34; The problem is literally just at the very front of my scalp. Female hair loss usually occurs as an overall, general thinning. I would get a little zit/pustule on the actual hair follicle, and then the hair falls out. This is the exact definition of folliculitis. I only wish that I would have found this product earlier. Other reviewers have said that this product is watered down...yes, it is, I think it&#x27;s supposed to be. It runs over your scalp like water. I assume that they make it so thin, so that it can cover your whole scalp easily. I enjoy the feeling. It has a cooling menthol feeling, that feels wonderful. I haven&#x27;t had one scalp bump since I started using it. My hair smells a million times better!! Even my husband agrees that the stink is gone!! If you think you have some type of scalp infection/fungus, buy this!! i&#x27;m ordering more right now, so I thought that I better spread the word to help someone like me. I have literally spent hours/days on Amazon looking for something to help me. I also recommend Acure Shampoo and Conditioners. I use the volumizing mint formula. The 2 products together have truly helped me.  Also, I started taking Biotin from Natorol and Collagen plus C from Neocell. Trust me, I have tried everything!! I was spending at least an hour a day(combined) glancing into mirrors to see my thinning/zitty hairline. This is not the way to live!! I consider myself an attractive, confident young women. The hair loss was taking it&#x27;s toll. Every time I read an Amazon review, I always wonder...is this one of those crazy people that has nothing better to do, but write reviews??? Please know that I am writing this to help someone like me!! BTW...I put this allover my scalp about 15 to 20 min before I wash my hair with Acure shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is seems to work well with folliculits as part of a regimen with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree hair &amp; scalp treatment (as mentioned by another reviewer) and vinegar.  By itself, it&#x27;s antibacterial with Triclosan, so I try to use this on and off. I think bacteria may be able to build immunity over antibacterials like Triclosan.  THe folliculitus dried up and flaked/scabbed off. However, minor to moderate flareups still occur, where I try to attack with vinegar at night and Therapro in the mornings (so I don&#x27;t go through the day with vinegar scent).  Haven&#x27;t had a major flare-up in 2 months, which is a big improvement for me.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well for my scalp seborrheic dermatitis and light folliculitis. I know everybody&#x27;s scalp is different. I experimented with many treatments before this one. For me it reduces itch on contact. I use with Selsun Blue Naturals 3% salicylic acid shampoo: 1st apply Thera Rx, then add shampoo to scalp &amp; wait 5-10 minutes (with or without towel) before shower, lather &amp; wash. Follow w/Pure &amp; Basic 2% salicylic acid tea tree conditioner. This started working after about a week and now I use every 2-3 days which seems to keep it under control for the most part. This is such an annoying, sometimes painful and frustrating condition, I hope this might work for someone else...</li>
    <li> I used it every day because I read a review that stated it help with bumps on the scalp. I didn&#x27;t help at all. I get these scalp bumps that are like a hive or insect bite, when scratched, the leak clear fluid. Doctors have given me meds that have done nothing and after reading reviews on here about people with similar problems who found success when using this product, I thought I&#x27;d try it. It didn&#x27;t work for me. I did like the cooling sensation it gives the scalp and it does not smell bad.</li>
    <li> I had been using sea breeze as my scalp treatment for two days when I received this, on the third day of my scalp treatment I used the therapro. Poured it on my dry scalp let it sit there a few mins then got in the shower rinsed and shampooed as usual. When I was towel drying my hair I started to get a faint gross smell, this didn&#x27;t happen with the seabreeze. (Note: was treating my hair with sea breeze cus I all of a sudden started suffering from overly oily scalp after stopping birth control) the sea breeze seems to be helping more. I may be using this wrong idk but it just didnt give me the same result as seabreeze did on the first use. And for all the rave this product gets I was expecting quite a result. Maybe mix the sea breeze and the therapro!?</li>
    <li> This is a good product and has helped my scalp problems a lot.  The only problem I had was with leaking of the product in shipment.  This needs to be addressed.</li>
    <li> AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 year of no poo-natural poo-expensive PH balance shampoo - baking soda - vinegar etc etc this was the only thing that cured my smelly scalp. It started working within the 1st week and I&#x27;m no longer paranoid about my hair smell and washing my pillows constantly. THEN I experimented with using it as an astringent and my skin and I was amazed at how quickly my skin cleared up. The difference is incredible. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this. My bottle has lasted almost a year and I&#x27;m happy to see it&#x27;s still on the market, I&#x27;m buying more as I now use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This pours really more like alcohol than it working up into a foam or lather.  I originally bought this for my scalp for after gym work outs. You will much rather pour this on your head then straight alcohol but like I said, it doesn&#x27;t work up into a lather much. Its also good for your face / neck and cuts. It has a distinct smell to it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works very well.</li>
    <li> If you have problems with a smelly scalp this will help.  It&#x27;s easy to use and does not smell bad, but will sting your eyes, so be careful.  You do not have to use it with the whole Therapro system.  I have used it with Head and Shoulders and it works well too.</li>
    <li> During this past summer , I developed small white spots under my chin and on my forehead. I thought it just wasn&#x27;t tanned enough. So I would stay in the sun longer only to notice that the white spots would only look whiter and because my skin was more tanned. After talking to my wife, she told me that I had a skin fungus. (I never knew that people could get a fungus on their face.) I could not find anything that helped in stores, so I looked it up this product up and had to try it. I must say that IT WORKED. I didn&#x27;t use the shampoo that they recommended with this product. I just used it as a face and a post shampoo wash. After using the product, I also noticed that the \\&quot;dry skin\\&quot; that would never seem to go away around my nose, beard, and mustache was gone. I realized that it wasn&#x27;t not simply dry skin as I thought. I think it was some type of facial dandruff, if that makes any sense. My wife also told me that my face looks clearer. I am so happy with this product and I would recommend it to anyone who has developed some type of skin fungal issue.</li>
    <li> First of all, the &#x27;Active Ingredient&#x27; in this product is Triclosan 0.3%, which you could buy for a fraction of the price of this product at any grocery store. Just wash your scalp with liquid antibacterial hand soap, which also &amp;#34;Kills 100 types of bacteria, staph, strep, fungi and viruses&amp;#34;, (both good and bad), leave it on for 2 minutes, rinse, then use your regular shampoo and conditioner. That&#x27;s my first issue with this product. I don&#x27;t use Triclosan, because I&#x27;m allergic to it, as are many people. I have other issues with it, as well. If I did use it, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for it. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find this out until after I received the two bottles I purchased. This should be stated on Amazon, and unfortunately, even Amazon wouldn&#x27;t refund my money, supposedly backed by their &#x27;A to Z Guarantee&#x27;. Shame on the sellers for not posting the ingredients! Soon, it will be the LAW to state that a product contains Triclosan, BEFORE you can sell it. Shame on Amazon for their useless &amp;#34;Guarantee&amp;#34;, too.  Second, this claim, &amp;#34;Reoxygenates the scalps microvascular system&amp;#34;, simply makes no sense. If making your scalp feel as though it&#x27;s been set on fire has &amp;#34;oxygenated&amp;#34; your scalp&#x27;s microvascular system, then I&#x27;m here to tell you, it&#x27;s unpleasant, at least to me. A simple massage will stimulate the scalp&#x27;s vascular system, although I&#x27;m not sure that it would have &amp;#34;reoxygenated&amp;#34; it! That&#x27;s just marketing pseudoscience. Shame on me for not recognizing BS when it&#x27;s right in front of my face!!! I was thrown off guard by the glowing reviews, I guess.  Third, this is watered down, just as the other reviewers stated. It&#x27;s like pouring burning watery mint onto your scalp. Then, I read the ingredient list, and tried to return it. The sellers were rude, told me that I needed a doctor if it burned my scalp, and refused to take it back. I bought 2 bottles, and I would have had to pay to return the one I hadn&#x27;t used. Now, I see it&#x27;s for sale for Prime members, but don&#x27;t be fooled. This stuff is potentially toxic, especially if you&#x27;re allergic to Triclosan, and don&#x27;t realize that this product contains it. At best, it&#x27;s no better that any shampoo, or hand soap, with Triclosan, and worse, it has ten times more &amp;#34;cool mint&amp;#34; than Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo, which I&#x27;d really like, except that it&#x27;s too drying. So, just imagine Paul Mitchell&#x27;s cool mint to the tenth power. Just image paying ten times the price for a bottle of watered down antibacterial hand soap.  Finally, this comes wrapped in plastic, but the container itself has no seal over the top. Unheard of. Maybe Therapro doesn&#x27;t bother to seal it. I wouldn&#x27;t know. However, anyone can plastic wrap a container. Without a seal over the top, this product would be incredibly easy to tamper with, dilute, or replace with cheaper substitute ingredients (are there any?). Just saying...  So, in short, study Triclosan, decide if you wish to spend this much to pour what may or may not be Triclosan, plus the equivalent of extra strength Scope mouthwash over your head, and take the plunge, if you dare. Just be sure to keep your eyes covered, because it could do some serious damage to them.  But, first, please research Triclosan before you purchase this product. According to the Minnesota Pollution Control, &amp;#34;Do not put Triclosan down the drain or toilet!&amp;#34;. Until they come up with another way to dispose of it, they advise throwing it in the trash, which is what I did with mine. By 2017, Minnesota&#x27;s ban on Triclosan will take effect, and other states may soon follow suit. There are environmental and safety issues regarding its use, and there are plenty of alternatives. The costs of using antibacterial soaps outweigh their benefits, and one cost may include losing more of your hair.  Check into the potential dangers of Triclosan before you buy this expensive, overrated crap.</li>
    <li> Although this came with a new topper (not pictured) that I don&#x27;t like, I have utilized this product for years.  I mostly use it for skin blemishes while my husband has used it for his head.  It worked wonders for him related to his hair folliculitis.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from seborrhea for 30 years have used everything from steroids to tar shampoos. I have seen numerous dermatologists and nothing has helped, everything I used dried out my scalp and most of the time if feels like it is on fire.. I have also suffered from hair loss..&lt;br /&gt;My daughter bought it for a follicle infection, sadly for her it didn&#x27;t work but she had read that some people had, had success with their seborrhea and so she gave me her bottle, This will be the 3rd bottle I have purchased, my condition covers my entire scalp, but miracles of miracles  it is getting better, I don&#x27;t care that it is very runny it saves me from having to part my hair and apply it to every section, I just start at the top of of scalp and literally saturate my head in it, I took it to my dermatologist I wanted to make sure it was ok to use, said there was nothing in it that would harm my scalp and if it worked then Yay &#x3D;) I recommend it to anyone with my condition and Hope it works as well for you as it has for me, oh and my scalp is no longer red and doesn&#x27;t  feels like it is going to split into.. My condition is not completely gone I imagine it never will be but this little miracle in a bottle makes it livable and that is something I can now live with &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Ok I had these red bumps at the back of my head near my hairline. They were gross and some had white heads in them.  I researched a bunch of products and found some people had success using this product.  I ordered and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t really give much instructions so I just applied using a cotton pad to the back of my head.  I also read a review on here that someone also tried Paul Mitchell Tea Tree and Scalp Treatment Shampoo so I also got that.  Using the 2 together the bumps on the back of my head cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were painful bumps and in about 1 week they were all cleared up.  So i recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great for scalp rinse with weave or braids.  I wear braids and weave, but I also do crossfit so I sweat profusely.  One of my hairstylist told me to try to product to keep my scalp clean before and between washes as need.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very irresponsible seller!!!&lt;br /&gt;Open, incomplete product with particles in the liquid. SELLER VERY INRRESPONSABLE AND DARING.............</li>
    <li> I am not reviewing the product yet, but the bottle came with the top sticker open. When I spend 21$ for shampoo, I want to make sure nobody opened it.</li>
    <li> I actually thought this would be a shampoo but after it arrived I saw it was a liquid you work into your scalp after shampooing. I used Head n Shoulders then let this stuff sit for a few minutes then rinsed it out per the directions. It made my hair very voluminous and it seemed really clean. I&#x27;m not sure how this is treating the color on my hair but I lasted about 24hours before the funky smell came back. I also made an effort to blow dry my hair completely so that there was no damp area for the mildew to grow.  I have used it 4 times and half the bottle is gone. I do have shoulder length hair so I may use more than someone with short hair. At 2.50 per use I would not repurchase unless it really knocked out the smell for more than 24hrs.</li>
    <li> Works great for my scalp, eliminates all odors! Odors seem to return when the scalp becomes oily and sweaty again.</li>
    <li> stings and leaves a mint essence hard to remove. but still no effect on scalp dont waste your money !</li>
    <li> My husband developed an extremely bad case of scalp folliculitis. His scalp was an angry red color and he had tons of white filled pustules. He couldn&#x27;t even sleep because he said it was liking laying on nails it hurt so bad. I did hours of research only to find that it is a very difficult condition to manage. Some people stated they were on antibiotics for years and years.  His hair was falling out with the inflammation and he was so afraid that he would lose all his hair and be left with a awful appearing scalp. We both hesitated going to a dermatologist because we didn&#x27;t want him to start on courses of antibiotics with no end in sight.&lt;br /&gt;He started using this as a scalp treatment 5 minutes before his shower. He then washed his hair using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Hair And Scalp Treatment Unisex...also purchased on Amazon. These were used simultaneously from day 1 so we are not sure if one product is superior to the other.&lt;br /&gt;The results are nothing short of miraculous. Within the first few days he had a ton of drying and flaking. The pus filled bumps were drying up and literally falling off his head. He continued to use both treatments for about 2 weeks. He has also been taking orally a probiotic, curcumin and oil of oregano capsules to work this from the inside as well.&lt;br /&gt;Merely 2 weeks later his scalp is over 90% healed and he has no pain or itchiness. He will maintain this daily regimen at least one more week.&lt;br /&gt;The beauty of these products is they will fight both bacterial and fungal infections.&lt;br /&gt;If you are suffering please give this a try. I never take the time to write reviews but feel so strongly about his success that I want to help anyone who might be suffering. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;Update - a few week after initial post and absolutely zero folliculitis remaining. Totally clear scalp!!</li>
    <li> Seems to work so far; have used it only for a short time. Did not know that a rinse  product should follow product use.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all. Liquid antibiotic that is not like a shampoo or cream and is difficult to use.</li>
    <li> The Product is workings and not a fast as some reviews had mention, but all around a good product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you,</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!  Its a shame that when Amazon shipped it they did not package it correctly and i lost a quarter of it!!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this shampoo for minor scalp issues.  If this does not work, go see your medical physician for another look at your scalp problems.</li>
    <li> It took 7 months for a dermatologist to listen and do a biopsy of my scalp. I have a bacterial infection under the skin of my scalp that causes burning and could only be seen under uv light. The biopsy came back with mild folliculitis with bacterial colonies. The Folliculitis is secondary to the condition.&lt;br /&gt;I put this in a misting spray bottle and treat my scalp in the morning wrapping it in a towel for 10 minutes and then rinsing. No shampoo needed. Very little hair loss and pain goes away as well as inflammation for most of the day, then I do a second treatment at night.&lt;br /&gt;This has allowed me to go outside again, even tho I cannot stay in the sun light long. I am also on anti-biotic. Derm refuses to do another biopsy to determine cause of bacterial infection, figures antibiotics are enough. This product allows me to function without much pain! It is helping the process soooo much.&lt;br /&gt;Some hair loss is expected with my condition but honestly maybe 15-20 hairs each treatment, and my hair looks healthy and clean. I really believe this is taking care of the infection from the outside while the antibiotics work on the inside. I have only been using for 2 weeks and have relief for most of the day. Will repost in another 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have scalp folliculitis for over 10 years and been through various treatments which all lead to same issue of becoming resistant.  I&#x27;m to the point where I&#x27;m on the maximum Rx of Bactrim and Nicomide to prevent &amp;#34;flairs&amp;#34;.  Since the Drs say there is nothing else available, I&#x27;ve decided to try combinations of topical products in additional to my Rx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Thera-Rx skin wash for several months and find it verify effective for quickly easing &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34;.  Anyone that is familiar with this condition is well aware that an itchy area is forbidden from touching in any way.  Years ago I learned the itch from mosquito bites is caused by the bacteria injected into the skin, which also gets worse when scratched as more bacteria is added. I experimented with anti-bacterial dish soap (no water) and found that if applied before any scratching to a bite would not only stop the itch in moments but also heals it quicker.  This concept lead me to this product as folliculitis is caused by bacteria so considered relative principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results so far is that this skin wash product is most effective for &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34;, especially in the event a pustule hemorrhages. I normally put several drops directly onto the effected area and let it sit and dry.  The irritation is normally tolerable if not gone within minutes. I&#x27;ll also note that when either directly applied or applied with dampened swab onto a pustule, for 10+ minutes, it seems speed up them drying out/healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In shower I&#x27;ll spot treat the irritated area with the skin wash, let it sit for few minutes, then will follow it with their Solv-X product.  After Solv-X sits for a couple minutes the &amp;#34;cool mint&amp;#34; feeling sits in, a couple more minutes and I rinse.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Thera shampoo, and it works. I have severe psoriasis on my scalp, and these products work.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old boy have the worst smelly scalp there is... He sweat a lot, but the worst smell came from his scalp.  I try every shampoo there is, from kids to adult..  But nothing can get rid of that sweat smell on his scalp.. Even after he took his bath, the scalp smell like he never took bath... I did my research and found this product.. You don&#x27;t know how thankful I&#x27;m for it.. Now before he took a bath I would spray this product on and leave it for 1/2 hrs... After that shampoo like normal... Now his head n scalp smell like fresh spring... N it stay fresh throughout the day... Even after he goes out and play... No more smelly sweaty scalp for my boy...</li>
    <li> Was watery. Did not lather. Cap looked like it was the wrong one for product. Cap was pointed and seal was stuck to cap not bottle. Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> I love this wash.  My hairdresser recommended it to help me with some flaky scalp problems and it has made a huge difference in my scalp in just a short time.  Granted I use it about 3-4 times a week, so it is not exactly a cure for flaky scalp, but it is keeping it under control and that is all I&#x27;m asking for.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. The next morning was still smelly&lt;br /&gt;I saw this video and bought everything and so far it has being excellent. I dont have psoriasis but this treatment works! http://youtu.be/K0UAv3Blung</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work to well. Is the product supposed to be super super waterd down? Very very very liquidy.</li>
    <li> A number of years ago I noticed, quite suddenly, that no matter how often or harshly I washed my hair, it would smell funky shortly thereafter. Having an extremely delicate sense of smell, this drove me out of my mind - to the point of keeping me up at night. I tried tea tree oil, etc., etc. I can&#x27;t even remember all the failed remedies I tried. Then I found a product called Carmol Shampoo online. It worked like a charm. I cannot tell you the relief of finding something that left me smelling pretty again. A bottle lasted forever since it only took a few days for the smell to disappear. Perhaps a year later something, and I have no idea what, would invade my follicles and I&#x27;d gradually (all the while in denial until it was undeniable) start smelling like a barn right out of the shower. When the bottle ran out and I went to reorder... WHAT?! THEY DON&#x27;T MAKE CARMOL ANYMORE?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You must be sh__ing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After numerous failed \\&quot;cures\\&quot; and an exhaustive search I found Therapro and it works. For anybody who has experienced what others have termed &#x27;smelly scalp syndrome&#x27;, which I believe to be a form of folliculitis, try this. It works for me but not all symptoms that sound alike share a common cause. One thing I do have to say, Carmol worked after one shampoo. I feared this wasn&#x27;t working because it took a few days to completely lose that smell. If I could only find the precipitator of this condition. I would simply really love to know. The active ingredient in Therapro is both an antibacterial and antifungal agent, so it doesn&#x27;t help much with a diagnosis. And doctors are generally not very good at diagnosing or treating this type of condition. We are on our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It is now September 6 and I can say that this stuff works. For a while I wasn&#x27;t sure because I kept catching a whiff of this smell I hate. I finally realized it was my hair, not my scalp anymore. Like laundry that&#x27;s gotten mildew, it&#x27;s difficult to get rid of that musty smell. But it kept getting more faint. My hair is very long now. It was very short the last time I had this issue. I imagine that I wasn&#x27;t washing the long hair as well as I was my scalp. When I became aware of this, after I&#x27;d treated my scalp, I started making sure I really sudsed up my hair when washing it and gradually that smell went away. What a relief. I stocked up on the stuff in case they stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3/27/13  Wore an old headband and started getting it back. Used Therapro THAT NIGHT and nipped it in the bud. Used it two days in a row and I&#x27;m still good a week later. Whatever it is, it&#x27;s contagious. I&#x27;m thinking fungal. Possibly the spores activated in the warm moisture of my hair. It&#x27;s unlikely bacteria. Those headbands were thrown together into a box when I moved a year ago. I hesitated, too, but was in a hurry and my hair was a disaster, so put this really thin, innocuous looking one on. Never again!!!! They all went through a long, hot wash cycle and an even longer hotter dryer cycle but am still afraid to wear them. Was half wishing they&#x27;d all disintegrate but they&#x27;re so beautiful. Only lost 3 of about 30, fyi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s unbelievable how much we take for granted. I&#x27;d just moved on my merry way with my nice smelling hair and bam! Stinky hair AGAIN! It&#x27;s a total game changer, and one that takes you completely by surprise. You&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;why me God, WHY ME\\&quot;. You feel like a horror story from the bible about locusts and pustules - until you see a burn victim or a kid with cancer. Then you&#x27;re like, \\&quot;sorry, just sayin\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s still more difficult to deal with than one would imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Whatever you try, if it works right away, use it for at least a week if not two. If you don&#x27;t, whatever is plaguing you can become immune to the active ingredient and then you will really be creating a problem. My first mistake was trying to wring out the Carmol bottle by watering down what was left on the bottom when I got a return of funky head. Carmol worked, but the active ingredient is the same as what&#x27;s in this and I fear the diluted solution allowed whatever it is to overcome it and grow stronger. Now I&#x27;m scrambling. All I know is, nothing works like Carmol did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/6/2014: I left off here with my hair getting back the smell (not as bad as before I&#x27;d started treating it) and me feeling thoroughly defeated. I&#x27;d read numerous times to try vinegar. &#x27;They&#x27; say to dilute it with water. I was so irritated in the middle of the night that I jumped in the shower, washed my hair then took an entire small bottle of vinegar and soaked my head from stem to stern, follicles to split ends. Let it sit for a good 5 minutes then rinsed it off. How many times can you say \\&quot;it works\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m saying just that. I did it every time I washed my hair for a week, no conditioner and I did&#x27;t care how I looked and it really doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. Then I went about my business as usual, only using conditioner on my ends and I&#x27;m smell-less. It&#x27;s been months. If this stops working they&#x27;ll have to commit me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/22/14: Still stinkless.t a return of funky head.

    <li> I like, It did solve my scalp problem. The only issue is that it gave me allergy.</li>
    <li> I had a situation going on my scalp, it was extremely itchy, burning and sore to the touch. I would go to different dermatologies and they would take a look at it and would say it looked normal to them. I will be given treatment for the itch, which mildly work. Until I came across with this one product I got it on October 2014 and gave it a try. I used to wash my hair every other day, so every other day I would apply this before shampooing not paying attention whether it was working or not. After a month I found out I no longer had to use it BC my scalp was getting and feeling healthier. I then bought nizoral 2% ketoconazole and used it once a week or every time my scalp would want to itch, it kind of felt as it the itch wants to come back but it doesn&#x27;t. Then on January I purchased the Shea Moisture JBCO line and my hair health and scalp overall is way better. I can go 3 to 4 days without washing my hair and it would be fine. It doesn&#x27;t help with foliculitis thou...I also had a bad dry eczema which was bogus and every morning I would notice a flaking dry skin on my face that was itchy and burning same as the scalp, then I remembered twondays ago thatbI still have my bottle of this product, well....I read it again and it says skin wash too!!! To I massaged my whole face with it then wet a cloth with warm water and put it over my face counting up to 10 to activate the minty sensation...oh my!!! What a relieve...two days now and I have softer skin on my face and no traces of this rash on my face....I will continue using it for a while hoping it will stay like that. :)</li>
    <li> This will be a review that gets updated over time.  I am creating this on Day #1, after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to write a lot because I KNOW there are others like me and this could be beneficial to them!&lt;br /&gt;My star rating will probably change as well - but I wouldn&#x27;t pay much attention to that since this stuff will be different for everyone...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick background:  Ever since I was a little kid, I had problems with my hair.  Whether it was short or long, wet or dry, clean or dirty - it smells like death.  It smelled like someone was giving me swirlies in the boy&#x27;s room at school...with a toilet full of feces.  Sorry to be gross, but that has been my reality for the last 20+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would shower after school and wake up the next morning because I could smell the scent of dog crap in my dreams.  It was my pillow case.  I would shower before high school and smell it every time I sat down and stood back up quickly.  If I scratched my head at all, my finger tips would smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I complained to my mother as a child, but was always told some excuse as to why my hair smells all the time.  Excuses like \\&quot;it must be a bad shampoo\\&quot; or \\&quot;you must not have did a good job rinsing\\&quot; or \\&quot;you must have gotten something in your hair\\&quot;.  It wasn&#x27;t until I was out of college and on my own that any kind of real progress was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two years, I used a sulfur bar soap called SAL3.  It smelled okay dry, but once it was in your hair it smelled like farts.  I would wash with the bar soap and then follow it with their recommended Dial Antibacterial Body Wash.  I remember the first morning waking up to a nice smelling pillow.  I remember being at work and leaning over a counter and then standing back up quickly and getting a whiff of that Dial Body Wash.  It was something I had never experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time went on, the SAL3 soap got less effective.  My head was resisting for some reason.  I continued using it anyways for the next few years because it was better than nothing.  Eventually, I couldn&#x27;t take the odor of farts coming from the bathroom after every shower as the wet bar of soap sat and dried out - so I went to my first dermatologist appointment a few months ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I have never seen anyone with this problem - you are a first\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Oh cool...great.  He basically told me what I already discovered on my own - that my head was really oily which caused some kind of fungus or bacteria to grow and stink up the place.  He wrote me a prescription for some medicated, anti-fungal shampoo.  I was very excited because this was the first time I had a doctor give me something MEANT for my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was small and contained a thick, bright red liquid.  It had a slight chemical odor which was a nice change compared to the scent of farts that I was used to.  I followed the directions and got to work.  My first morning I awoke to a clean pillow.  My head smelled okay during the day when I would scratch and sniff.  I was happy but kind of bummed the bottle was so small and would require weekly refills.  Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just like the SAL3 soap, my head fought back and the stuff became useless - even quicker than the SAL3.  It even caused some acne on my scalp which was totally new to me.  Shucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am.  I got the Thera Scalp Wash yesterday afternoon in the mail.  It was not what I was expecting so I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply it.  It had no instructions and their site sucks.  It basically looked like one of those bottles sandwich places us to put oil and vinegar on your sandwich.  I think the actual solution inside the bottle was as thin as water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I winged it last night at about 9PM.  I stood in the bathroom in front of my vanity mirror and slowly squirted the stuff onto my head with one hand while rubbing it in with the other.  I may have done a little too much, but I wanted to make sure it got where it needed to be.  I gave it five minutes to sit on my hair/scalp before hopping in the shower.  I rinsed it out and then did my normal shower routine and finished by washing my hair with my handy Dial Body Wash.  I let it dry and then made my wife sniff my head since she has had to live with my foul stench for the last 7 years.  She said it smelled like shampoo.  This wasn&#x27;t surprising since I had showed only an hour or so ago.  I made her sniff again right before bed last night - same response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my results.  I will update as time goes by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day #1 - Thursday (APPLIED AT NIGHT)&lt;br /&gt;9:41AM -  It has been over 12 hours since my initial application.  Scratch and sniff test with my finger has positive results.  No negative scents.  Slight positive scent from shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;12:51PM -  Still no negative odor on main parts of scalp after scratch and sniff testing.  Some faint negative odor on very edge of scalp about ears but it may be due to poor application last night.  Will try a different method to cover entire scalp tonight.&lt;br /&gt;4:25PM - I think this is the latest in the day that I have passed the scratch and sniff test after showering the night before...in my entire life.  Even the medicated stuff from the doctor didn&#x27;t fight my head like this stuff is doing on day one.&lt;br /&gt;9:15PM - It has been 24 hours since I applied this to my head.  I still pass the test.  I decided that I am not going to use it again tonight and just shower and shampoo with normal products.  Maybe I will make it into Day #2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day #2 - Friday&lt;br /&gt;Did not apply scalp wash.  Showered like normal.  Made it through the day/night without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day #3 - Saturday&lt;br /&gt;Did not apply scalp wash.  Showered like normal.  Made it through the day/night without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day #4 - Sunday (APPLIED AT NIGHT)&lt;br /&gt;Started to fail scratch and sniff test towards end of the day so I applied the scalp wash before my nightly shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day #5 - Monday&lt;br /&gt;Passed scratch and sniff test/pillow sniff test in the morning.  Passed throughout the day.  Showered normally at night without applying the scalp wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day #6 - Tuesday&lt;br /&gt;Passed scratch and sniff test/pillow sniff test in the morning.  Early AM still smelling fine/neutral.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is smelling foul at around 4PM.  Will require application tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I near the first week of using this item, it seems to be like it may end up being something I apply every other night (for now).  My head may react the same way it did for the medicated shampoo and this stuff may eventually become useless or counterproductive.  I will update again after a few weeks to see where we stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I have almost finished using my first bottle of this stuff on my head.  I do it every other night and shower each night on the weekdays like I have for most of my life.  If I go more than 2 days without using the scalp wash, I can smell my head when I move quickly.  I don&#x27;t mind the every other day routine and the solution seems to last longer since I cut my hair shorter.  I upped it to 5 stars for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am nervous it could one day dissapear and I will be screwed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 01/23/15 - It has been 3 months since I started using this.  I am almost through with my second bottle.  I am still sticking to applying every other day and continue to have similar results to what I had initially.  Sometimes I skip using it when I have long weekends to avoid going through the product too quickly - and I can totally tell the difference during those long weekends...rancid cheese head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a hair cut since earlier in this review - so it is about 2.5-3\\&quot; in the longest areas.  Curly.  More product is required to cover my scalp compared to when I had shorter 1\\&quot; hair.  Kind of makes me think this stuff isn&#x27;t even possible for a female or male with hair longer than 3\\&quot;.  A bottle would last them a week instead of a month.  Sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read people with \\&quot;smelly body oil\\&quot; having good encounters with Milk Thistle.  I bought some from the pharmacy and take as the bottle suggests and my facial oil still smells funky a few hours after a shower or face wash.  I am going to move up to the stronger doses or liquid versions next to see if I have any luck like the other folks online.illow sniff test in the morning.  Early AM still smelling fine/neutral.  Hair is smelling foul at around 4PM.  Will require application tonight.    As I near the first week of using this item, it seems to be like it may end up being something I apply every other night (for now).

    <li> Works great for fungus in your scalp</li>
    <li> This product is okay. It works to keep your scalp fresher a little longer than regular shampoos, but it doesn&#x27;t completely stop scalp odor from returning.</li>
    <li> I have had smelly scalp syndrome for 25 years and had to wash my hair almost every other day to keep it from going &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34;. For a woman with afro-textured hair, that&#x27;s a LOT of work! Thank you Therapro for making this product. After years of visiting doctors and dermatologists to get my infliction diagnosed (with no success) I scoured the internet for others with similar symptoms, which eventually led me here. I use this on my scalp every other day as a leave-in and I&#x27;m finally odor-free for several days before having to wash (and blow-dry) my hair again. Love this product!</li>
    <li> It has a good smell, but unfortunately it does not help if you have folliculits. Though I used it for one month and i didn&#x27;t see any changes.  I&#x27;m not sure what product to use next (please suggest), i heard of Sulfur soap might help my problem maybe i&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
    <li> I give only one-star because 85% of the bottle leaked out onto my other items before arriving on my doorstep.  The design of the bottle top has been changed.  It now has a snap-on cap that covers an open spout similar to a hair color bottle.  There is a seal underneath but mine had a hole punched in it as shown in the picture.  It was fulfilled by Amazon. I&#x27;ve purchased other hair products with better sealing caps before by mail and the seller usually tapes the caps into place very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks.  It seems to be helpling my scalp folliculitis, so at this point I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> There is no use with this product for folliculitis . Its waste of money</li>
    <li> Watered down.  So seal on top of bottle. Not same as the one sold in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Counterfeit ?? Or company turning 1 bottle into 2 bottles for profit ??  Hmmm</li>
    <li> this did not meet my expectation.All u feel is a cool mint feeling on your head.</li>
    <li> UPDATE SINCE USING THIS FOR MONTHS NOW: Maybe it was hopeful wishes, but I still have these red bumps that show up sporadically.  Nothing has really changed since using this wash + their shampoo, just a little lighter in the Amazon gift card balance.    Only negative (as others have posted) - Amazon&#x27;s shipping/packaging on this is terrible. I ordered the skin wash and solv-x shampoo, both bottles were leaking. It was a mess. I called Amazon and got some $ back as a result. If enough people complain, maybe they will alter the shipping and packaging.  As for the products - they have been tremendous. I suffer from folliculitis and my red bumps would get bad. Tried Neutrogena TGel, Ketoconazole shampoo (otc and Rx) and some other stuff I tried from Walmart. The skin wash and solv-x shampoo BY FAR have reduced my red bumps that can get big and nasty.  Here&#x27;s what I do: 1) Wash hair with solv-x shampoo in shower morning and night. I put it on just after getting in the shower and leave it on till the end of my shower. 2) Dry hair out of shower, apply skin wash ONLY at night. Coat hair good with it. 3) Leave skin wash on all night. 4) Next morning, shower and wash hair again, apply normal hair stuff for day. Note - I am a male w/ very short hair, so this regime is very quick and easy. Not sure how it would work for a female w/ longer hair.  I know the instructions say to put it on before the shower and then rinse it off. My case of red bumps was really bad at times and it seemed that they appeared over night. So I just leave the skin wash all night to hopefully combat those bumps. I also sweat a lot while sleeping, so that could be the issue there. I can&#x27;t stop the sweating, so the skin wash for now appears to fight whatever is actually causing these bumps.  These 2 products have not gotten rid of the bumps completely, but the bumps are less frequent and usually smaller. And this treatment has been the only treatment that actually helped. Everything else I tried up to thispoint did nothing.  If you have red bumps on your scalp, these 2 products are worth a shot.</li>
