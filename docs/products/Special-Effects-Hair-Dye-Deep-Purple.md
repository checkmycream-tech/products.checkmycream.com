      <li>Excellent color!</li>
      <li>I am totally impressed with this product.  </li>
      <li>So I applied a month ago and while this dye bleeds quite a lot even now, it works perfectly and doesn&#x27;t even seem to have faded a bit.</li>
      <li>Best color out there.</li>
      <li>It looks  brilliant in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous!</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s a great purple</li>

      <li>Very interesting.</li>

      <li>I LOVE the way this shade turn out!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I chose this color!</li>
      <li>hair is now the perfect beautiful shade of deep purple I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>colour (which comes out a nice magenta on my hair).  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t bleach your hair it does fade with each shampoo, but it fades gracefully to a nice lighter purple, rather than turning off-colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
      <li>Deep purple is beautiful and will fade beautifully too.</li>
      <li>It is very important that you wear gloves and apply a generous amount of petroleum jelly around your face, ears and neck.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not shocking purple, and</li>
      <li>but make sure you have bleach and rubbing alcohol for the color on your skin.</li>
      <li>And the color is lovely.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I believe the colour will stay longer on bleached hair because the bleaching process makes the hair strand more</li>
      <li>As you wash it, it gradually fades to more of a cadbury purple.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this product and color.</li>
      <li>Love the color</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair dye.  </li>
      <li>I received so many compliments I could not believe it.  </li>
      <li>, it is more pronounced and shows up while you&#x27;re indoors.</li>
      <li>know and love this brand .&lt;br</li>
      <li>Deep Purple is the best color purple.</li>
      <li>I am a HUGE fan of Special Effects hair dyes.&lt;br /&gt;They really are the best out there for funky colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a great product that produces vibrant colors just like the pictures.</li>
      <li>I am not disappointed at all!</li>
      <li>Love the color, it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
      <li>This purple fades very beautifully, and sometimes it can be very bright or have blue or red tones under certain lights.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with the easy purchasing and fast delivery of the three deep purple bottles I received.</li>
      <li>also really enjoy the &amp;#34;Virgin Rose&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Too light for my liking.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great about it.</li>
      <li>This stuff will come out in the shower for weeks, though too - and don&#x27;t wear shirts light in color until your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;But only one star off, because at this price grade it&#x27;s really the best quality dye I&#x27;ve found, and you do get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Special Effects is my go-to brand now for unnatural colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the pigment is so strong, you can even get away with diluting it with some conditioner.</li>
      <li>sg&#x3D;he loves it and plan one getting alot more color too!plus this one and your other ones have great prices</li>
      <li>I dyed my hair for the first time and decided that I wanted a nice deep, not too bright, purple color</li>
      <li>The stains go away when you clean your bathroom.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, Special Effects is the way to go.</li>
      <li>I had tried Manic Panic on two separate occasions before trying Special Effects brand</li>
      <li>Special Effects</li>
      <li>Let me begin by saying that Special Effects are vegetable based dyes...</li>
      <li>But I have used the products enough to give you some good tips.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Electric blue is good.</li>
      <li>But if you are looking for a deep gorgeous purple this would be it.</li>
      <li>&gt; Granted, I have not yet opened the bottles that just arrived ,( quickly and packaged well</li>
      <li>After about 6-8 weeks it eventually fades to a light rose colour on my hair, which is naturally white.  </li>
      <li>Besides loving it myself, I constantly get compliments on my hair color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>still think this is worth it, but I felt it was worth</li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s after making sure to shampoo and rinse until the water runs clear immediately after dying.</li>
      <li>I decided to order online after reading positive reviews of Special Effects Hair Dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>right after I do it -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Special Effects products for a number of years now, and really like them.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really have any problems with that when I lived in the bay area because the water isn&#x27;t super chlorinated.</li>
      <li>I had a lovely streak of purple down my back, my neck was bright purple for days, my face had streaks of purple, and it took 3 wash jobs to get the dye off of my scalp.</li>
      <li>I actually try for 2 hours  or more when I have the time.</li>
      <li>That said, for the first two nights after dyeing your hair, put your hair up in a bun or somehow away from your neck when you sleep, so you don&#x27;t end up with &amp;#34;grape nape&amp;#34; in the morning.  </li>
      <li>so one bottle sufficed and was even more than enough.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I mix it with a protein conditioner and it dyes my hair a really pretty lavender color.  </li>
      <li>Sold out and back ordered for over a year, most places.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will say that this dye will stain everything it touches so when applying it in your hair and washing it out, make sure that you take the proper precautions so that you can limit the staining.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, it really really does bleed all over everything!</li>
      <li>Exactly what it needs to be: Purple.</li>
      <li>also use Cherry Bomb underneath at the sides and back, it&#x27;s luscious and amazing, deep rich intense color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After washing my hair a couple times, you really were able to see the people, then it faded to a magenta kinda color which I didn&#x27;t mind because I got several compliments on the color.</li>
      <li>It stays in my hair for SO LONG... months after dying it, it fades to a beautiful pink color without getting splotchy or washed out looking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Deep Purple a few times, and it is the best semi-permanent purple dye I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>my idea of a good time :/</li>
      <li>down side is that it gets kind of pinky as it fades.</li>
      <li>Every time I wash my hair for the first couple weeks after I dye it, my whole shower turns purple because so much of the color rinses out.</li>
      <li>(For the record 91% pure alcohol from a pharmacy works wonders getting off your skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again.</li>
      <li>I start with naturally gray hair, and it takes better than professional normal colored hair dyes to the gray.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it in my hair for well over a month and the color is still vibrant!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes very little dye to colour the hair - my first bottle lasted 3 years just doing streaks, and the colour was still effective after years.  </li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t take on my hair very well -</li>
      <li>The hair, not so much.</li>
      <li>the pros say about using a &amp;#34;cold rinse blast&amp;#34; really causes me to shudder.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The hair dye i ordered showed up 2 days before it was expected so that was great and it was all packaged neatly.  The color itself is gorgeous. It looked great on my already medium/dark brown hair. That being said, the dye gets EVERYWHERE. Places you didn&#x27;t even have the dye touch was purple.  My bathtub looked like a grape when i was done rinsing my hair.  I had a lovely streak of purple down my back, my neck was bright purple for days, my face had streaks of purple, and it took 3 wash jobs to get the dye off of my scalp. My boyfriend had to help me get it off of myself and my hair. I wore gloves and my hands were still purple for days.  Now every time i wash my hair the purple washes out, which i expected but i didn&#x27;t expect to have to bleach my shower weeks after the dye job. I&#x27;ll be honest i&#x27;d probably buy again just because of the color. but make sure you have bleach and rubbing alcohol for the color on your skin. wear gloves, use Vaseline around your head, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Special Effects products for a number of years now, and really like them.  The deep purple comes out a very dark purple at first, and fades first to a brighter purple, then to a nice magenta.  After about 6-8 weeks it eventually fades to a light rose colour on my hair, which is naturally white.  I believe the colour will stay longer on bleached hair because the bleaching process makes the hair strand more permeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes very little dye to colour the hair - my first bottle lasted 3 years just doing streaks, and the colour was still effective after years.  I put it on with a mascara brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really enjoy the &amp;#34;Virgin Rose&amp;#34; colour (which comes out a nice magenta on my hair).  I tried a teal/green colour as well but it didn&#x27;t take on my hair very well - possibly because I was using it on the slightly darker hair at the back of my head.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and color. It&#x27;s not shocking purple, and a lot of people will think your hair is just dark, until the light hits it; they do a double-take, and then smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For over 2 years I have been using Special Effects, Ive tried Pimpin Purple when Deep Purple was out of stock, I didn&#x27;t like it. Too light for my liking. But I have used the products enough to give you some good tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Cherry Bomb underneath at the sides and back, it&#x27;s luscious and amazing, deep rich intense color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear gloves for sure! My white shower curtain has tinged purple over time.  You can use Soft Scrub to get it out of your countertop, floor or toilet seat. I found it beneficial to use a color seal right after I do it - my favorite is Garnier Fructis Color Shield, which I can&#x27;t seem to find lately :( .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, when applying, keep damp and comb it through a lot, I leave it in for 20 minutes. I can&#x27;t say enough great about it. Besides loving it myself, I constantly get compliments on my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side is that it gets kind of pinky as it fades. When I reapply it, to get that darkness back, it doesn&#x27;t soak in as good unless you : wash your hair with REGULAR shampoo (not color treated stuff, you WANT to wash out what is there); apply it just like it were the first time, and COMB it thru several times, NOT allowing it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the pros say about using a &amp;#34;cold rinse blast&amp;#34; really causes me to shudder. I do not do this, I hate the thought of putting my head under cold water.. but don&#x27;t take hot showers or you&#x27;ll see streams of dark purple running down your body...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never done the part of the instructions that say to apply Vaseline to your ears and neck, I just pin an old towel around my neck .. if I get it on the back of my neck or my ears, use your finger in a washcloth, dampen and use dishsoap or barsoap and it will wipe it off. I also always get it on my scalp, and never had any problems or reactions.calp, and never had any problems or reactions.</li>
    <li> I had tried Manic Panic on two separate occasions before trying Special Effects brand and I must say there is a ton of differences! This color lasts and lasts and lasts! Its been 4 weeks since my last dye job and when I wash my hair it still looks as though I just dyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My poor shower looks as though I&#x27;ve murdered Grimmace in it though &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> I am totally impressed with this product.  This brand is very much superior to others I have tried.  Recently I decided to visually represent my individuality with a daring new purple look.  After two full dye attempts my hair only stayed purple for a few days.  I decided to order online after reading positive reviews of Special Effects Hair Dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed a small amount, about 2 tablespoons, with an equal amount of shampoo.  It is very important that you wear gloves and apply a generous amount of petroleum jelly around your face, ears and neck.  I started with damp hair and shampood in the dye.  I let it rest for about 15 minutes and then rinsed my hair carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now the perfect beautiful shade of deep purple I was looking for.  I work in a professional capacity as a Program Director and did not want pink hair.  I was looking for something dark and subtle, yet fun and pretty.  I received so many compliments I could not believe it.  If you are looking for purple, choose this one!</li>
    <li> This stuff is VIVID. Now. I made the somewhat catastrophic mistake of thinking I could get away with not using gloves, thinking I could wash my hands immediately after application. MY HANDS WERE PURPLE FOR THREE DAYS. And this was using exfoliating wash, frequently, oatmeal lotion, and scrubbing in chlorinated water. My neck was also bad, ears and even my torso (front &amp; back) where the water had run down me in the shower :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND!!&lt;br /&gt;Warning: this dyed the porcelain sink basin and tub, where application and rinsing occurred. Solution? Carefully put gel TOILET BOWL cleaner with bleach everywhere that is stained. Let set briefly and rinse. The gel is best as it doesn&#x27;t drip/run while it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color on the hair lasts for a few weeks, even on dark hair w/o bleach it tints it, especially in the sun. This stuff will come out in the shower for weeks, though too - and don&#x27;t wear shirts light in color until your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of Special Effects hair dyes.&lt;br /&gt;They really are the best out there for funky colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this review is for this Deep Purple color alone, it is TERRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;I thought reds were the worst at running after dying, but at least they would settle down after a couple washes.&lt;br /&gt;So far, i have washed my hair TEN TIMES and its still dying everything, my ears, my nails, towels, you name it... its now purple. (For the record 91% pure alcohol from a pharmacy works wonders getting off your skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again.</li>
    <li> Product WILL stain everything. All dyes of this nature do. Be careful to cover anything you don&#x27;t want stained.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used. It stays in my hair for SO LONG... months after dying it, it fades to a beautiful pink color without getting splotchy or washed out looking. SUPER dark to begin with. Sometimes I mix it with a protein conditioner and it dyes my hair a really pretty lavender color.  The only thing I will say about it is... if you have a lot of chlorine in your water, be prepared to have a purple shower for a while. I didn&#x27;t really have any problems with that when I lived in the bay area because the water isn&#x27;t super chlorinated. Now I live somewhere with water that smells like a swimming pool. Every time I wash my hair for the first couple weeks after I dye it, my whole shower turns purple because so much of the color rinses out. And that&#x27;s after making sure to shampoo and rinse until the water runs clear immediately after dying. Obviously this is not Special Effects fault, but just beware!</li>
    <li> Excellent color! Stays in a long long time! I love it. There is no other like it! The tip I would say is make sure you don&#x27;t wear any white the next day the color will bleed onto your clothes the next day.</li>
    <li> Love the color, it&#x27;s easy to use but it&#x27;s very messy.... comes out in every wash and never completely sets.... but it&#x27;s a great product that produces vibrant colors just like the pictures.</li>
    <li> I ordered this dye because it had really good reviews in terms of the color payoff and the time that it stays in your hair. I am not disappointed at all! The color is gorgeous! And it lasts longer than any other purple hair dyes that I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve had it in my hair for well over a month and the color is still vibrant! I will say that this dye will stain everything it touches so when applying it in your hair and washing it out, make sure that you take the proper precautions so that you can limit the staining.</li>
    <li> Love the color it&#x27;s a great purple can&#x27;t wait to use it!!!</li>
    <li> Best color out there. Holds color weeks  longer than any other brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Deep Purple a few times, and it is the best semi-permanent purple dye I&#x27;ve found so far. It is rich and deep. If you have dark brown hair like me, it only shows up in the sunlight, and it only lasts about 2 weeks. However, if you bleach your hair yo a blonde, it is more pronounced and shows up while you&#x27;re indoors. It lasts longer also, and fades to a pretty purplish pink before completely fading out.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to decide if this is the color for you, but are considering others: don&#x27;t get Pimpin&#x27; Purple unless you like pink. It is VERY pink, not purple at all, and fades to a bright pink. The Electric blue is good. It fades to purple and then to pink in my hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair dye.  It smells nice, makes my hair so soft, and it has the longest lasting color out of all the different brands I&#x27;ve tried.  It fades to a pretty red-violet color, so if I get lazy it doesn&#x27;t look awful til I get around to coloring it again.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that Special Effects are vegetable based dyes... they more-so STAIN the hair rather than dye it. So don&#x27;t be alarmed; of course you&#x27;ll see it wash out every time you wash your hair. But lemme tell you, the pigment is STRONG!! I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic in the past, and it just fades way too quickly. Special Effects is my go-to brand now for unnatural colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the pigment is so strong, you can even get away with diluting it with some conditioner. This way you can save so much product, and one bottle of color can last for months! Especially since the color is so long-lasting anyways, you&#x27;ll be saving so much money. This purple fades very beautifully, and sometimes it can be very bright or have blue or red tones under certain lights. Very interesting. It&#x27;s been 4 weeks since I put in the deep purple, and the color is as vibrant as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does stain everything it touches. Don&#x27;t be a silly goose and not wear gloves when applying it, or not protecting your hairline or skin with vaseline. I even wear gloves when I wash my hair. But because it is only a SURFACE STAIN, I&#x27;ve never had any problems with my bath areas being ruined with stain marks. The stains go away when you clean your bathroom. And of course, as a general rule with all other hair dyes, always rinse out the color away from your face and body so your skin doesn&#x27;t get stained. I&#x27;ve never had problems with my skin getting stained... and even when it did happen, it would only last a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Special Effects is the way to go. Deep purple is beautiful and will fade beautifully too.</li>
    <li> Special Effects Deep Purple!!&lt;br /&gt;I searched high and low for this brand and shade.... Sold out and back ordered for over a year, most places.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only purple I use on myself or clients. 20 year devoted user!&lt;br /&gt; ( the pigment is deep and heavy... Towels will be sacrificed.)&lt;br /&gt; Granted, I have not yet opened the bottles that just arrived ,( quickly and packaged well, I must add.)&lt;br /&gt;  They appear brand new and unused.&lt;br /&gt;I know and love this brand .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review if the product is not as it should be.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m very impressed with the easy purchasing and fast delivery of the three deep purple bottles I received.</li>
    <li> Special Effects is the best staining dye on the market, I think.  It lasts longer than other dyes.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> sg&#x3D;he loves it and plan one getting alot more color too!plus this one and your other ones have great prices</li>
    <li> It took me some searching to finally find a color in the shade of purple that I wanted. This color starts out quite dark, almost a purply black. As you wash it, it gradually fades to more of a cadbury purple. I LOVE the way this shade turn out! It looks  brilliant in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it really really does bleed all over everything! I am used to colors like this bleeding for a day or two but this color NEVER stops. Everything is covered in this color now. My hair doesn&#x27;t even seem to need to be wet to rub off on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think this is worth it, but I felt it was worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is also dark enough to cover well over other colors. My hair was green and blue before I used this dye and it turned out fine.</li>
    <li> So I applied a month ago and while this dye bleeds quite a lot even now, it works perfectly and doesn&#x27;t even seem to have faded a bit. I have thick but short hair so one bottle sufficed and was even more than enough. Needless to say, just one bottle of this dye definitely goes a long way. And the color is lovely. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product provides AWESOME color, but runs all over your face for DAYS and dyes your collars, pillowcases, and even your earrings! You have to paint it on lightly in order to minimize (and I mean minimize) the staining. I almost had to cancel a conference the first time I did it because it stained my face and ears so badly! Just be careful.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair for the first time and decided that I wanted a nice deep, not too bright, purple color but just to the end of my hair. I&#x27;m so glad I chose this color! When I first applied it, it was such a deep purple that you could only see it in the sun. After washing my hair a couple times, you really were able to see the people, then it faded to a magenta kinda color which I didn&#x27;t mind because I got several compliments on the color. If you don&#x27;t mind having magenta hair after a couple of weeks, I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Dyed my shower purple. Dyed my soap purple. Dyed my bathrobe purple. Same for my pillowcase and sheets. Dyed ME purple. The hair, not so much. And when I used it, I rinsed my hair for AN HOUR before the color finally slowed down running out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For days and days, every time I washed my hair, this junk would come running out. And for days and days I had to use bleach to scrub my shower to get the color out. Threw away my soap. Used an Oxy stain fighter for my bathrobe and pillowcase. Washed myself last, with an exfoliating shower gel, so I could clean up the purple streaks this left on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my idea of a good time :/</li>
    <li> I loved the purples but hated the mess this caused on everything. Even a strand of hair would stain a floor tile and sink. But if you are looking for a deep gorgeous purple this would be it. Just it was messy for me, never seemed to rinse out right constantly had stained skin every time i showered  and dyed my parents bathtub from blue to purple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color for the past 8 years consistently, and for longer than I&#x27;d like to think about before that.  I have tried every other brand (manic panic, punky color, directions, ion brilliance, raw, etc), especially during this last backorder where it was impossible to buy this anywhere for over 6 months.  Nothing even begins to come close for the richness of color and longevity.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to leave it on for more than 20 minutes.  I actually try for 2 hours  or more when I have the time. At least for me, the longer I leave it in initially, the longer the dye lasts in my hair.  I start with naturally gray hair, and it takes better than professional normal colored hair dyes to the gray. My husband starts with bleached hair and it takes beautifully to that as well. You can see my results in the customer images section.  As everyone has mentioned - gloves are a must, it will dye anything it touches - my husband who uses electric blue wrote up a helpful tutorial about 10 yrs ago - iago.net/hair (iago dot net slash hair) If, prior to dyeing you use a shampoo like prell (or any other shampoo that you&#x27;d normally avoid because it is too harsh to your hair) and  you don&#x27;t condition before dyeing, and then after dyeing, you avoid using conditioners with &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34; (silicone, dimethicone, etc) I find the post dye color bleed (on your hands, neck, pillow case etc) is greatly reduced.  That said, for the first two nights after dyeing your hair, put your hair up in a bun or somehow away from your neck when you sleep, so you don&#x27;t end up with &amp;#34;grape nape&amp;#34; in the morning.  If you get it anyway a washcloth with soap and some scrubbing should remove it. Or baby wipes - those things are great for more than you can imagine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it needs to be: Purple. For your head. Deep Purple is the best color purple. Oh, how it shimmers majestically in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off because it tends to end up everywhere: your shirt collar, your hats, your pillowcases, your hands, your neck. Your loved ones. Your cat. You&#x27;re a danger to expensive fabric furniture for weeks. (We make sacrifices. I cut my hair short and bought purple pillowcases.) And it doesn&#x27;t stick for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But only one star off, because at this price grade it&#x27;s really the best quality dye I&#x27;ve found, and you do get what you pay for. If you don&#x27;t bleach your hair it does fade with each shampoo, but it fades gracefully to a nice lighter purple, rather than turning off-colors.</li>
    <li> There was staining in my tub longer than there was dye in my hair. It was so not worth the time and cost.</li>
