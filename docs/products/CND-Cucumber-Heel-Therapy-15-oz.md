<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product - I have used this for years, however, this was the best price.  Recommend highly to all that like soft skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  65 and have dealt with dry feet all my life.  This year the woman who gave me a pedicure recommended I try this cream.  I was faithful this entire winter in applying this cream daily.  It is light and has a fresh fragrance.  I am a fan.  I have tried so many heel creams / foot creams and just cannot make myself apply the thick, greasy creams everyday, especially when I don&#x27;t see the results.  I really committed myself this time by buying the largest jar!  It works and I unequivocally recommend it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing if you have dry calluses heels. Simple as that. It&#x27;s a little expensive but a little goes a long way. I use nightly before bed.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 years, and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on the heels of my feet! Thanks</li>
    <li> I have used the product before and it performs as it is represented.  In today&#x27;s world that&#x27;s a reason to continue using a product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last five years with great success.  During the dry winters it keeps my feet in great shape.  I also use it on my hands and love it.  The product has a creamy consistency and is pleasing to the senses-highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was in Michigan in the Spring and Summer and my hands and feet were dry and cracked from the climate change.  The pedicurist there suggested I try this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing.  I use it 1-2 times a day, usually in the evening at bedtime and after a shower in the AM.  When I returned to Florida in the Fall, my pedicurist was delighted to see how well my feet looked even though I had not been getting my regular twice a month pedicures.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I initially got a small sample jar from my nail stylist. She uses it in her salon. I have found it to be very effective in keeping my feet smooth between pedicures.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care product I have ever used for dry flaky skin! Try it and you will like it. My results were almost instant and are definitely lasting. I thought I was going to have &#x27;alligator legs&#x27; for the rest of my life - wrong!</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have found to heal those cracked heels.  I have used many, many products before and this is the best ever!  I applied it day and night the first week and was very pleased with the healing results.  It is now part of my daily routine and my heels are once again soft and normal!</li>
    <li> I have always had deep cracks in my heels. This is the only lotion I have found that keeps my heels soft. I use it every night before bed and have not had any cracks in my heels. I can wear open back shoes and do not have to worry about walking on sore split heels. I love it!</li>
    <li> love the heel therapy does a great job</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I use it everyday on my heels and it keeps the skin soft.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this creme! I put it on daily and it keeps my heels from cracking even in our dry Colorado mountain winter weather.</li>
    <li> I love it and so do my feet.  Great price compared to what I use to pay at the spa!</li>
    <li> This heel cream is the best that I&#x27;ve ever found.  I live in AZ and my feet are always cracking from the dry climate.  My husband tried it and now he uses it all the time too!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a few years and it heals my dry badly cracked heels.&lt;br /&gt;Yes will recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it helps keep my heels soft.....used it for years in New England and now in Florida.  Yes, it is alittle on the expensive side, but that old saying, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is certainly true with this product. Love it!</li>
    <li> While its no miracle cure for poor heels that take a beating and are calloused from sand volleyball, it does make the feet much softer. The smell is wonderful and it&#x27;s very rich and creamy. I put it on my knees, elbows and décolletage and have actually noticed a difference in the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I just got this product three days ago and started using it in conjunction with the microplaner that a lot of people buy together with it. I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my feet.  They haven&#x27;t been this smooth since I was young.  I&#x27;m almost scared to delve into the ingredients to see if there is anything harmful in them since this product works so well.  I microplane before I shower (dry) and then put the product on after my shower.  I&#x27;ve always had a lot of dry skin on my feet no matter how much I moisturized and scrubbed, it never improved to a great extent.  Try this, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Excellent for soothing my dry skin during our harsh winter, and keeps my feet soft and smooth in between pedicures.  It has a very slight scent that doesn&#x27;t linger, but the wonderful, smooth effects last until the next shower.</li>
    <li> I use the CND Cucumber Heel Therapy every morning on my heels and sometimes on my elbows. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> This product softens your feet...even if you have rough/calloused heels. If you use regularly and put on socks in a short time you have soft feet. When I get my pedicures they cannot believe how great the bottom of my feet are!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the condition of my heals, but they do feel softer. I guess I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used CND Cucumber Heel Therapy for years! I order a large15 oz. jar about every other year to use mostly on my feet, but it can be used on any dry spot on the body.</li>
    <li> I use it on all of my skin after exfoliating.  It is incredibly soft.</li>
    <li> Have used for years.  Good for your feet.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! My nail tech introduced it to me. I&#x27;ve used it for years. Ordering through Amazon.com is a little less expensive. And with Prime, I get free shipping, which makes it an even sweeter deal!!!</li>
    <li> Our pedicurist gave us a small sample to use on our feet.  We saw immediate improvement soe we ordered a supply for ourselves.  We are now enjoying smoothe ankles and heels.  It works well for us.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Even if I don&#x27;t scrub my heels, I put this on and it makes them smoother.  It has a pleasant smell and is not greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years after having a pedicure done at a high end spa.  Use it after every bath/shower without fail.  No more heels catching on the bed sheets!  Be careful if you put on sandals right after application as it can be slippery.  Other than that--Love it!! And this was a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Great cream for my feet and legs!</li>
    <li> The best foot cream I have ever used++++++++ It really works. It makes my feet very smooth and tender +++++++</li>
    <li> Best foot/heel cream I&#x27;ve ever used!  I use it on my arms and legs too!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wherever there&#x27;s rough skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Makes my feet feel silky smooth.  I put it on my feet, then cover with cotton socks before bed.  In the morning my feet feel silky smooth. I love that this lotion isn&#x27;t greasy.  It smells very nice too.  The 15 oz. is a MUCH better bargain than the smaller 2 oz.</li>
    <li> This is the best heel cream!</li>
    <li> i love this product!  my feet are always cracking and bleeding and this product makes them so smooth when i use it regularly.  would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Will need more soon!  Works great!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Use it everyday, my feet are so soft!</li>
    <li> My family and friends...I have used this product for approx.  5 years....was happy that I found it on your site...</li>
    <li> The soles of my feet get dry so easily...  I&#x27;ve tried so many different products - this one is the best so far.</li>
    <li> And I mean it literally! She has such a problem with dry heals, she would be up at night in torment. Not any more!&lt;br /&gt;This was just the answer for her.</li>
    <li> My niece and I love this product.  This is a gift for her and cannot wait to give it to her.  Excellent price and super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Love it!  110% effective. You will notice the difference within days.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Best cream for my rough heels....I recommend to everyone I know. Love it</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I have found for rough heels and rough skin in general.  My husband will also happily use it on his badly cracked heels.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who gets small cracks in the bottom of their feet or has very dry skin on their feet.  It is not greasy and works really well.  It smells good too!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and is exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic problem. I apply a small amount just after showering. It smells good and within a few days of using it, the dry painful heel was healed. HIghly recommend, it&#x27;s the only product that works for me.</li>
    <li> It not only works on my feet like nothing else ever has, but I use it on my arms and hands after my shower.  Will never give using it!</li>
    <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever used.  I have been buying it for years.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have found for my dry feet and cracked heels.  I have tried a number of other products, and none of them have done the trick.  I always smooth this on before bedtime, and read for 15 or 20 minutes while it does it work.  It works even better if you have the time to soak your feet beforehand and smooth with a paddle or pumice stone, and then apply the product.  Caution -- if you try and walk around before it has a chance to sink in and do it&#x27;s work, you will find your feet kind of slippery, so that&#x27;s why I usually perform this treatment at bedtime just before I retire.  I even smooth it over a couple of patches of eczema that I have on my ankles and it helps.  It smells wonderful and is soothing.  I have a hard time keeping my Chihuahuas from licking my feet or sticking their little noses in the jar when I apply it, it smells so good.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Cucumber Cream on a daily basis on my heel and I have seen marked improvements.  I am really satisfied with this product.  I have tried other creams and this is the only one that has improved the conditions of my heel and other areas of my feet.  Happy I bought the large jar.  Thanks to all the other raters of this product before me that gave this product 5 star reviews!</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff. Works great on feet and on hands before bedtime.</li>
    <li> the best for dry cracked feet.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! A little bit goes a long way and it really keeps the spots moisturized.</li>
    <li> Best foot creme if your have cracked feet.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best I have ever used. I bought it from a manicurist for an insane amt of money.After using it all up I went searching on line for a larger container. Buying it from amazon was 2 dollars an ounce and from my salon was 6.50 an ounce.HUGE SAVINGS. The best thing is that you use a tiny bit about the size of an m&amp;m and it covers your whole hand or foot and it soaks right in, smells great, heals cracks in cuticle or feet in 2 days if you use it twice a day.This stuff is truly amazing.</li>
    <li> This cream is so smooth and lovely that you may be tempted to eat it.  Don&#x27;t waste it that way.  Instead, smooth it on your feet, elbows, hands - wherever you have some dry spots.  I  have battled callused feet for years and this cream is the very first thing to make a real difference.  A little goes a long way although the jar is a very generous size.  I will absolutely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I get some pretty good callouses from working out. Couple that with drying out due to the environment and I&#x27;m left with hands and feel that look and feel pretty neglected. This stuff stays on and keeps me shaking hands during my business day without scratching people.</li>
    <li> CND Cucumber Heel Therapy is a must!  It&#x27;s a great product, keeping feet and heels &amp;#34;sandal ready&amp;#34; all the time.  Love it and wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> Love this product...and at half the price of my salon!  Quick ship too!  Why do I have to put seven more words?</li>
    <li> I have very dry heels so based on the reviews I was hoping this would moisturize my heels.  I does pretty good but I was hoping for more.  If you don&#x27;t have REALLY dry heels that eventually crack, then this will work better for you.  The scent is pleasant but since it is pricey and I need more than what this gives, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best I have used on my feet---ever!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for your heels. My heels had began to crack due to the cold weather, but within 1 week of applying the cream my heels are super soft. It has an amazing scent and dries up very quickly. Leaves your feet and legs really soft. I have used the medicated heel creams and Vaseline but nothing compares to CND cucumber.</li>
    <li> Healed my cracked heels almost overnight.  Smells nice and is not greasy.  I would highly recommend this product.  The jar is quite large for the price.  Well worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> There are not very many foot creams/moisturizers on the market.  I am very anal about moisturizing my feet on a daily basis because I hate when they feel even the slightest bit dry, especially at night and when I sleep.  This CND Cucumber Heel Therapy is worth the cost. It is not overwhelmingly thick or too thin, it is just the right texture and heaviness to leave your feet feeling quenched.  If you use a foot bath and foot file first, and then use this, it works and absorbs into your skin even better, and leaves your feet feeling nice and soft.  I have looked around a lot at Beauty stores and online for different foot moisturizing products and to me, this is the best and and worth the cost.  Also, it lasts quite a long time, months and months, so that makes it even more worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. It is very good for this purpose. Seven more words are being sent now.</li>
    <li> This lotion works wonders.  I love it!  I had been looking for this forever and finally find it here.  It also lasts forever.  I was first introduced to it at a salon and it is well worth the price.</li>
