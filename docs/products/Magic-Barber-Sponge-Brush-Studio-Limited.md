<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works nice but it falls apart and get in hair</li>
    <li> This little sponge did the job and is a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> It twisted the hair good but after a couple of uses it started crumbling up. Black crumbs everywhere.</li>
    <li> Noticed the curls right away and I love it!</li>
    <li> Came a day early  and gives a great look to your hair if you want the twisted nappy look</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for, exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Feels cheap but it gets the job done! My husband likes it so far.</li>
    <li> Does not work like ive seen online...I have natural curly hair and it made my head look spiky...I get a better twist with my fingers. .I used it once..its now being used to clean my bathroom</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair be on fleek using this</li>
    <li> This has been a great sponge brush. It lasts longer than the actual one the barber gives.</li>
    <li> The only problem is that the black stuff from the sponge rubs off in your hair then gets into your eyes.  But its better that getting my hair retwisted every two weeks for $60</li>
    <li> I ordered this sponge for my son who is 11 years old.  HE LOVES IT!!  Kids at his school are asking him how he gets his hair like that!  He has major swag as it is, but with his awesome twists he is SWAGALICIOUS!  Great purchase, arrived promptly, excellent service, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> All the people giving this 1 star and complaining about it, listen up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is always one rule that applies directly to finance and investments. That is, you get what you pay for. This cost only six bucks, these aren&#x27;t made to last for months....&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you want cool looking dreads and curls, don&#x27;t be cheap. You have to invest your money and buy at least 1 every 4-6weeks. Shipping was extremely fast but that&#x27;s because I live in downtown Detroit. I ordered this yesterday with expedited shipping and literally received it today. That&#x27;s faster than &amp;#34;1 day shipping&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, sorry for bad picture quality. Btw, my hair is short right now, this works best if you have maybe 2 inch afro at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;Wow, thank you guys for all the positive feedback! I never expected to get this many thumbs up ratings. This just shows that sometimes you have to be real and let people know the truth. It&#x27;s a buisiness out here, people won&#x27;t make extremely durable products and sell them cheap. It&#x27;s been a while since I bought this but this hairstyle is really blowing up now. It&#x27;s very popular so i would really suggest it. Still to this day i rep this hairstyle.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work good, unstead the sponge was breaking into small pieces.</li>
    <li> works good will buy again</li>
    <li> I order this product for my boys and the brush works as advertised.....</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sponge. I bought this for my son and he loves it. We bought others that was very thin and wore out within a couple weeks. This bond is quality and will last.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Looking for something different.</li>
    <li> This sponge is Absolutely wonderful!  Did my son hair in less than 3 min. For the price I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This item is really cool. My sons from age 5 - 26 loved it. I ordered 4 for Christmas and they all use it daily. At that price you couldn&#x27;t go wrong and with this it was just right...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like they say it does.</li>
    <li> False advertisement totally looks different from the display here I wanted the one that&#x27;s in the display picture which my friend has and it work wonders. The one that was sent to me is smaller and has very small holes wasn&#x27;t what I hoped for. But its &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; I guess if you want a nock off</li>
    <li> In week I&#x27;m be done it&#x27;s change day by day I like it I&#x27;m on 💯💯</li>
    <li> My fiance&#x27;s hair turns out great every time. Very easy and fast to style.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this purchase because it doesn&#x27;t work and I would have returned it but couldn&#x27;t find the return label</li>
    <li> It did not last long. I ordered another one from a different company when this one split in 2 after less than 1 month of usage.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> Looked exactly like how it does in the photo, I believe it&#x27;s the cheapest on Amazon</li>
    <li> good usage. Only thing about it is that it began to tear and leave pieces of the foam on my clothing after about three weeks.</li>
    <li> It did what it was suppose to do Ty</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like this product it kinda does what all the hype says it does and then again it doesn&#x27;t. I imagined great coils and curls of hair... This thing just bunched the hair together in peaks. I had better success using my hands and the same circular motion. Maybe if the holes in the sponge were smaller. But his product just sits in a draw it doesn&#x27;t give me the look I wanted.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent and came sooner than promised!</li>
    <li> Awesomeness works like it did in the barbershop Wifey loves the hair!!</li>
    <li> Finally got my locks.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I loved the way it curled my hair I received so many compliments.</li>
    <li> Made my hair come out.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised, love the product</li>
    <li> It was great it came quicker than i thought it would.</li>
    <li> This product was ok it didn&#x27;t produce the amount of curl or dread pattern i expected but it worked to its potential for the money</li>
    <li> It worked great for the first week, but started to fall apart shortly after.  I had to throw it away👎🏿</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t last as long as I told it would</li>
    <li> I order this for my friend and Iguess he liked it , it put alot of twist in your hair ,(small and plenty)</li>
    <li> because the picture is what I wanted because we use that one &amp; it did awesome but they sent us the cheap one and it didn&#x27;t work good at all. so next time if that&#x27;s not what your really shipping then don&#x27;t put up a picture of it.</li>
    <li> Works just right with my hair, which isn&#x27;t an inch yet.</li>
    <li> My son loves this sponge...and the outcome of his twist.</li>
    <li> Definitely works well on my son&#x27;s very short hair.</li>
    <li> Sponge needs to be more firm so pieces don&#x27;t break off in your hair.</li>
    <li> Works very well my boys love it!</li>
    <li> Should be made out fo plastic sponge fall apart</li>
    <li> Shed too easy but it works</li>
    <li> Placed my order more than a week ago hey wheres my twist I want to get started</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister. She loves it. Her hair never looked better.</li>
    <li> I loved it and it works great</li>
    <li> Used it every other day, for small twists, its very durable</li>
    <li> It shed alot and made my sons scalp itch.</li>
    <li> Did not like this as it was much bigger than I thought it would be. Gave it away.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my son...He loved it!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as great as I expected.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, but brush itself didn&#x27;t last long....wore out too easily and was hardly used!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. You can use the sponge after utilizing any hair moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Does the trick. It helps finish the look I was going for.</li>
    <li> I gave sponge to my grandsons, they  love it!</li>
    <li> Sponge works well so far!</li>
    <li> Great product and works well. Only minor problem is it doesn&#x27;t come with a case.</li>
    <li> It works GREAT!! Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Just as expected...works great!!</li>
    <li> I use my sponge on a daily basis. It is quick and easy to use. The results are awesome. I get a lot of compliments on my hair since I started using it. Three of my friends have bought sponges since seeing my hair.</li>
    <li> It does just as it says. My son really likes it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My son saw this on youtube and wanted to try it and it works!!!!</li>
    <li> This a great magic barber sponge and the curl last for a week or more. Thanks it safes time and money.</li>
    <li> Great for coiling hair!</li>
    <li> my son said is good because i ordering for him</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the sponge pictured but I&#x27;m still 100% satisfied</li>
    <li> Fell apart after a months use. Started to leave the pieces of the sponge in my hair.</li>
    <li> Does the trick for the twist but the sponge breaks up</li>
    <li> Wellv this product did not give me the desired effect and the shipping time was far too long.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and twist the hair as advertised.</li>
    <li> My son loves this and it makes his hair too cute.</li>
    <li> Great for creating curls, I wish it was a bit smaller for handling</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for my son, he loves it and it works.</li>
    <li> Works fine for me my hair is naturally curly and it enhances my curls. I use Shea moisture curl enhancer with my sponge and I have had my sponge for a month or so and it has not fallen apart on me...well not yet anyway. Still holding up</li>
    <li> Works great, thank you.</li>
    <li> This made some easy nice twist!</li>
    <li> Still use my sponge on and off! Works good!</li>
    <li> I love it, I get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Initially, I was creating twists in my hair with hair rushes, towels, and the palm of my hands.  While they all do the job, this product is so much easier to use.  So far, I have had no problem with it falling apart.  It is not necessary to rub your hair hard with this product.  Just use gentle circular strokes and you can achieve perfect twists. I usually use a little hair gel or hair cream on slightly damp hair.</li>
    <li> This is a must have tool in your arsenal when your teenager decides he wants curly hair. I was skeptical but it worked</li>
    <li> I love it it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Results very mine came out alright right after i washed my hair but since i do it at night it really doesn&#x27;t stay too well the next day when i go to school or something like that</li>
    <li> Sponge is great, and works. But little pieces break off with wear and overuse. You&#x27;ll have all of these little sponge pieces all over the place.</li>
    <li> I tried to make this with a regular sponge, did not work.  Even if it did it would not work as hood as this sponge. I like the beadie-bead look perfectly separated little curl.  Did i mention the price is right.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;  Put the sticker on the other side.  When I peeled it off it took some sponge with  it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Glad I finally ordered one.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after my sons barber used it on him after his hair cut. This is perfect for his Mohawk :)  It adds texture. To get better results I would suggest using water and some sort of grease or oil.</li>
    <li> This worked great when my hair was super short! It&#x27;s still short, but I discovered that it has to be really short  (like unable to two strand twist) in order for me to use it! But for those people who have a fine texture it will probably work on up to 3 inches! Should you buy it? Well, you can get it at the beauty supply now...but it does work better than a sponge!</li>
    <li> This sponge worked great with wet and dry hair id definitely recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing sponge thing.... all you have to do is hold it lightly over my short &#x27;Fro and move in circles in the same direction for about 1 minutes and voila, no need for complex and lengthy styling and saves me a ton on product that would otherwise weigh down my hair (which is 3b curly btw and a bit over 2 inches long). Golden. Would recommend to anyone with short kinky hair.</li>
    <li> love this sponge, has provided a new style for me!</li>
    <li> The product works fine.  Be aware that it enlarges significantly when it gets wet.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for thank you</li>
    <li> Because of the grade of my hair it does not do twist but it produces a head full of curls so I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush I just got lined up with a faded Mohawk medium length with a part and the brush just adds the extra Pop to my hair everyone compliments me it is absolutely a great product I don&#x27;t recommend on damp hair it will start to shed and leave pieces in your hair but I don&#x27;t care pat it out I love the product</li>
    <li> Got here on time and works great</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t even come out the way you would expect it to, very weak and fragile product.</li>
    <li> Sponge began to break off in the hair after several uses, but OK other than that.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get mine yet but I looked it up on youtube an people say and show that it curls your hair I can&#x27;t wait to get mine</li>
    <li> Yeah very different what you see is not what you get</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know it only works with certain kinds of hair or is there something I need to put on my hair first</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my Barber sponge.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and my so  and they love it</li>
    <li> Woudt recommend it the holes are to small</li>
    <li> Perfect,  curles my hair just right ..</li>
    <li> Great... It works awesome! And shipping was good too.</li>
    <li> So my son decided he wanted hair like the &amp;#34;Duke starting five&amp;#34;-Google it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes! That hair-so mom to the rescue- I searched for the brush that he said would give him that horrible looking style! Found this one-price wasn&#x27;t an issue because after all who wants to spend $$$ on that hair style! Certainly not me- so let&#x27;s get it it! The product came packaged well- it look just as the pictures show. It&#x27;s sorta stiff as most sponges are when you first open them. He immediately used the brush to give him the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; and it worked! I would have to say it worked a little to well- he used this product a couple of times a day! Not sure if that&#x27;s what you are used to do but-he did! And his hair looked the same! So I would have to say it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the flip side- if you are going to use it frequently-- as in a couple times aday -be prepared to purchase another brush because it will wear out as this one did! So first it started to tear right around the handles-I guess after rubbing it around your head over and over again the glue starts to seperate. Also, the holes enlarge and get worn leaving grey spongey residue in your hair! After that it&#x27;s not useable anymore because your picking small grey pieces of sponge out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again but it did give the look he was going for!</li>
    <li> Delivery took much longer but I like the product.</li>
    <li> My son used this sponge once and small black particles from the sponge began falling everywhere.  I have no idea if this is meant to be for one time use, but it created a mess..</li>
    <li> I use it everyday with my own products. I suggest one if you have a short afro..</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son and he seems to be satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love the new style it gives my hair. Great price it&#x27;s a sponge it&#x27;s not gonna last forever.</li>
    <li> Got this for my father, he loved it, he keeps smiling everytime he uses it!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Affordable price,  High Quality product, and it was delivered within days!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Starting to fall apart already, and not making my hair as curly as before.</li>
    <li> I would not repurchase this. I didn&#x27;t find this sponge brush to give any curls. On ethnic hair it appears to give &amp;#34;naps&amp;#34;. Not pleased.</li>
    <li> I was using a brush then I saw this on amazon and had to try. Glad I did dreads without actually having dreads.</li>
    <li> Works like the brand name. Good buy</li>
    <li> Not a bad product for the price it&#x27;s being offered at. It does get the job done, however do prepare yourself for the sponge start to shedding and even tearing apart.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t last long at all, the quality of the product wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> My son really loves it</li>
    <li> The more you rub on your hair, the more definition you get.</li>
    <li> Works great as described. Great use of money.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son. He loves his sponge.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Got exaclty what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Pretty much what i expected but for best results, use conditioner/gel and do sections of your hair in same directions. Guaranteed curls/coils</li>
    <li> This product really sucked. It did nothing for my hair. Rip off!!!!!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. My son was super happy</li>
    <li> Loved the look but the sponge wears out fast.</li>
    <li> I liked the sponge very much.</li>
    <li> This gives me a new dimension to my hairstyle.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Larger than expected but good product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. The sponge does not last long at all. It starts to break down after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Relatively quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase and the price was good..</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and it seems to work great for his hair. Didn&#x27;t notice any of it falling apart or anything else like that. He&#x27;s very pleased with it as am I.</li>
    <li> Great Quality. My son twists his hair at least once per day and has had good results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well I thought</li>
    <li> Good product. Creates twists/curls on wet/dry hair. I find if I do it with my hair a little damp, then hit it once again when it dries up, I see best results this way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok just breaks down to easy</li>
    <li> The Magic Sponge Brush changes the texture of my sons&#x27; hair in minutes.</li>
    <li> Worked amazing on my boyfriend. Easy to use, and the curls are tight. He looks like a new man!</li>
    <li> I bought the sponge for my 13 year old son, he loves it and it does exactly what he wanted.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, and the product works as expected</li>
    <li> Great quality, works great and recieved it really quickly!</li>
    <li> Bigger than expected, but my son loves this.</li>
    <li> I love this product, works so good. The sponge does not actually have the word &amp;#34;TWISTS&amp;#34; on it though which saddened me a little, but the overall product does wonders.</li>
    <li> Sponge did create a coil, however, it did not hold up well. Sponge start falling apart after two weeks of use. Natural sponge works better</li>
    <li> Work great! Thank you</li>
    <li> The only reason why this specific product received  4 stars from me is bc it didnt say &amp;#34;Twists&amp;#34; like it shows in the advertisement picture above..also i received an oval shaped sponge and not like the one above.. other than that this is a great product. As long as you have the curling lotion/cream or spritz  you are good to go! Nice curls/locks and price is great. as a barber this product is a must have for clients that are going for a more trendy look with fades or blow outs..My nephew loves it bc its easy for him to do his hair now.. hes only 6 yrs old. Great product to have either home or for your salon/barbershop.</li>
    <li> My son say this works. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome. I like it and would recommend it. I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Brush is too large for the average female hand.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what I was looking for it to do which is make my hair curly and I have been getting tons of compliments... In fact, everyone is saying I need to keep this style!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my nephew and he is happy!</li>
    <li> It does actually give u curls, just don&#x27;t go to harbor else they&#x27;ll really be twisties</li>
    <li> Not the same item shown</li>
    <li> Works really good my son loves it</li>
    <li> thank you.  great product.</li>
    <li> Love it...did just what it said. .</li>
    <li> Great price great product</li>
    <li> Great for  curls and it&#x27;s affordable</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do what I expected</li>
    <li> This works but the sponge wears out too easy.</li>
    <li> bigger than i thought it wood be</li>
    <li> Good Deal. It&#x27;s just like the original nudred</li>
    <li> The sponge twisted the hair with added products.</li>
    <li> Great came right on time</li>
    <li> Works good need another on the people love the look and always wanna buy minds from me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but the holes are too big if it&#x27;s being used on shorter hair. This would be better for taller hair because it&#x27;s big.</li>
    <li> Great product. I can&#x27;t wait to use it. It looks just like what it does on Amazon.com. I cant wait to use this product. I&#x27;m waiting for my hair to get a little thicker before I use it. Everything else has been a positive experience.</li>
    <li> I love my son new look with the curly sponge</li>
    <li> My son loves this brush!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product very easy to use</li>
    <li> Terrible  quality. The sponge is falling apart and leave residue on hair.</li>
    <li> The brand &#x27;Twists&#x27; that you see advertised in the picture, is not the product delivered. It is falsely advertised, and it has bot worked for me.....it does not twist my hair. I would  not recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Kinda bigger than I expected but it does the trick</li>
    <li> Great package and delivery time. Works....just not on my hair :-(</li>
    <li> This brush really does work!  Thanks and it arrived in great time</li>
    <li> I thought it would be bigger and i don&#x27;t know if the holes are big enough or separated enough IMO. However it does a decent job, maybe i  need to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> it is hard to form the the curls i have very short hair and it should have did great but it didnt</li>
    <li> Sponge crumbles and the middle forms a bowl shape</li>
    <li> This item did not work.</li>
    <li> this is not for people with longer hair.....I wish I could have returned it :(</li>
    <li> didnt work well. the texture should be harder to cause more friction on my head to create twist.</li>
    <li> does not work on permed hair</li>
