      <li>I like it better than the cheap plastic ones you&#x27;d get at a grocery store, but I&#x27;m not seeing the value of this $100 brush.</li>
      <li>Perfectly wonderful, as expected.</li>
      <li>I love this brush, as soon as you start to brush your hair you can feel how smooth your hair is after.</li>
      <li>I will never buy any other brand of brush again after having this brush, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful heirloom brush worth every penny of the incredibly high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I received very quickly</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still good as new.</li>
      <li>Also, it brush my hair so smooth and easily.</li>
      <li>I have several Mason Pearson products and they are all reliable and great for all types of hair.</li>
      <li>so far, so good.</li>
      <li>so I kindly gave him the older brush and bought this one.</li>
      <li>30 years after the original purchase, I decided to it was time to treat myself and order the identical product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*****ly enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair.</li>
      <li>that gets SUPER tangled at night...</li>
      <li>Mason &amp; Pearson brushes are the best and very hard to get.</li>
      <li>This makes the expense of a Mason Pearson brush well worth the money--it&#x27;s a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brush so far.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>This makes the expense of a Mason Pearson brush well worth the money--it&#x27;s a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>My husband loves it dearly though, and really enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair.</li>
      <li>The size is nice, and it doesn&#x27;t take me too long to brush my hair.</li>
      <li>I first received my first Mason Pearson brush in 1983 as gift from my parents.</li>
      <li>I have short silver avg to thick hair wavy and this size brush is just perfect for me.</li>
      <li>and I try and pretty much succeed in doing the 100 strokes per day routine, and</li>
      <li>I think I paid about $35 for it, but I eventntually threw it out as it wasn&#x27;t strong enough.  </li>
      <li>This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes.</li>
      <li>In fact the seller was very prompt in email response.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are two things you need to know when you&#x27;re ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost.</li>
      <li>Her hair really is silkier.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost.</li>
      <li>I have really fine, long hair,</li>
      <li>will definitely come back for more , combs also .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.   </li>
      <li>I may buy a cheaper all natural bristle just to have it, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for another brush at this stage of my life.</li>
      <li>Takes weeks and weeks to be delivered but that&#x27;s because these come from the UK or something - around that area of the world or so in a round a bout way.  : )</li>
      <li>come with a cleaning brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought the 1/2 natural and 1/2 nylon which is a little strong for my head, but it&#x27;s quite invigorating on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>and they certainly give you enough guidance on what to buy -</li>
      <li>It is so soft and shiny now.</li>
      <li>My young daughter repeatedly has asked for one.  </li>
      <li>Ordered this for X-mas present since wife would not spend this much on one.</li>
      <li>Years ago I had an all natural bristle Mason Pearson</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought this brush, it is expensive but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, this mixed bristle brush is for normal, finer, and shorter hair.</li>
      <li>but my husband uses it; although I have short hair it is very thick and straight and coarse and the brush bristles won&#x27;t reach all the way to my scalp, but slides over the top hairs.</li>
      <li>This mixed bristle brush will work well for you if your hair is fine to normal and not too long or too thick.</li>
      <li>, however I had a full thick head of hair and the natural bristles weren&#x27;t quite enough.  </li>
      <li>I have fine medium length hair, my husband and daughter have long, thick hair.</li>

<li> I wish the natural bristles were as long as they nylon bristles, I think it would be a softer brushing experience, but alas the naturals are about 1/2 the length of the nylon, making the nylon much stronger on your head.  </li>

<li> i&#x27;ve taken to washing my hair only a few times a week, and (unless someone&#x27;s not telling me)</li>
<li> I was nervous about international shipping but it made its way oversea a few weeks after I ordered the product.</li>
<li> other consideration is the bristle type.</li>
<li> Otherwise, you&#x27;ll need to go with the Detangler because the bristles are stiffer and can reach down through all of your hair to the scalp; the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair.</li>
<li> This cut my morning routine in half.</li>
<li> All the other little girls and Mom&#x27;s were very interested.... and shocked by the price.  </li>
<li> i got the mason pearson to tame some of my grays.</li>
<li> I recommend them to everyone with the saying that \\&quot;What is expensive works out actually cheaper!\\&quot;</li>
<li> My daughter had been wanting this brush for a long time, but soo expensive.</li>
<li> Now that I&#x27;m used up, broken down and loosing my hair, I bought another Mason Pearson.  </li>
<li> This brush seriously has changed my hair around!</li>
<li> But as they are so expensive it became a birthday gift for her this year.  </li>
<li> but you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good quality, feels good on the hair, dont make the hair oily , and i feel special when using it!!</li>
    <li> Everything good. Best hair brushes in the world. All the girls in my family have one and some of the boys.</li>
    <li> It is a Cristmas gift for my daughter at Hawaii I&#x27;ve heard she loves it .</li>
    <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;This is a review for a Junior (medium-size) Mason Pearson brush made of seven rings of mixed boar bristle and nylon. The longer bristles are nylon and the shorter ones are boar bristle. It is a beautiful heirloom brush worth every penny of the incredibly high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the larger Mason Pearson brushes, including this one, come with a cleaning brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things you need to know when you&#x27;re ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort. One is the size: full-size (the largest size), handy (medium sized), or pocket (the smallest size). This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes. The smaller sizes have shorter bristles. The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair. If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you&#x27;d do better with a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other consideration is the bristle type. Do you want a mixed bristle brush like this one that is part boar bristle and part nylon? What is most comfortable and performs the best with your hair. This mixed bristle brush will work well for you if your hair is fine to normal and not too long or too thick. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll need to go with the Detangler because the bristles are stiffer and can reach down through all of your hair to the scalp; the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair. Mason Pearson also makes an All Boar Bristle Brush for finer or shorter hair but I have never tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this mixed bristle brush is for normal, finer, and shorter hair. I bought it for myself but my husband uses it; although I have short hair it is very thick and straight and coarse and the brush bristles won&#x27;t reach all the way to my scalp, but slides over the top hairs. My husband loves it dearly though, and really enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair. This makes the expense of a Mason Pearson brush well worth the money--it&#x27;s a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--but it&#x27;s worth it. If you&#x27;re the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost. That&#x27;s how we did it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For additional information on Mason Pearson visit their web site at masonpearson dot com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****ly enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair.

    <li> sure, it&#x27;s a bajillion dollar hairbrush. but once you make the investment, you&#x27;ll never go back. i got the mason pearson to tame some of my grays. it works well to soften the hair and to bring shine all the way from follicle to end. i&#x27;ve taken to washing my hair only a few times a week, and (unless someone&#x27;s not telling me) the brush helps to distribute oils in a non-greasy way. so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Mason &amp; Pearson brushes are the best and very hard to get. This company had in stock and I received very quickly</li>
    <li> Best in the world. Costs a fortune but you can&#x27;t beat it. I always buy the mixed bristle / never just the boar bristle. Have for many many years.Takes weeks and weeks to be delivered but that&#x27;s because these come from the UK or something - around that area of the world or so in a round a bout way.  : )</li>
    <li> Years ago I had an all natural bristle Mason Pearson, however I had a full thick head of hair and the natural bristles weren&#x27;t quite enough.  I think I paid about $35 for it, but I eventntually threw it out as it wasn&#x27;t strong enough.  Now that I&#x27;m used up, broken down and loosing my hair, I bought another Mason Pearson.  I bought the 1/2 natural and 1/2 nylon which is a little strong for my head, but it&#x27;s quite invigorating on my scalp.  I like it and I try and pretty much succeed in doing the 100 strokes per day routine, and I think it&#x27;s helping.  I wish the natural bristles were as long as they nylon bristles, I think it would be a softer brushing experience, but alas the naturals are about 1/2 the length of the nylon, making the nylon much stronger on your head.  Overall I like it.  I may buy a cheaper all natural bristle just to have it, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for another brush at this stage of my life.</li>
    <li> This is our third mason. Two are for us, this one is a gift. We love ours and this one is for a friend who styles hair for a living and has always wanted one. All we can say is that you&#x27;ll notice th difference.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush, and worth every penny!  I have really fine, long hair, that gets SUPER tangled at night... this brush does the job with no problem, every time!  I will never buy any other brand of brush again after having this brush, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I have been using Mason and Pearson brushes for 30 years now; throughout these years I&#x27;ve changed brushes only twice and both were Mason Pearson brushes! I recommend them to everyone with the saying that \\&quot;What is expensive works out actually cheaper!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love this brush, as soon as you start to brush your hair you can feel how smooth your hair is after. The size is nice, and it doesn&#x27;t take me too long to brush my hair. My boyfriend has really long hair and it still doesn&#x27;t take long to brush. I am glad I bought this brush, it is expensive but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for X-mas present since wife would not spend this much on one. Now that she has it, she loves it. It works well on her hair even though she has long, think hair.</li>
    <li> I have slightly frizzy hair and have to flat iron or curl it daily. I have a mix of oily hair (at the scalp at the end of the day) to dry hair on the ends. Friends of mine that have this brush kept saying how it&#x27;s the best brush in the world and after using it daily I probably wouldn&#x27;t have these issues. They swore by it and said their hair has never looked healthier. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference though and it&#x27;s been over a month. It&#x27;s just a brush. I like it better than the cheap plastic ones you&#x27;d get at a grocery store, but I&#x27;m not seeing the value of this $100 brush.</li>
    <li> all my family will be getting these for presents next year , what a wonderful thing to do to your head and hair . I wish everyone could enjoy the wonderful feeling this brush makes in your hair and scalp , cant say enough .love .it  will definitely come back for more , combs also .&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if you can over brush ? just kidding  just love the feeling and look of my hair and they certainly give you enough guidance on what to buy - I have short silver avg to thick hair wavy and this size brush is just perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brush so far. I had it for 4 years and it&#x27;s soooooo sturdy and durable. There is no way you can damage this brush. I&#x27;ve been tossing it all over the place and it&#x27;s still good as new. Also, it brush my hair so smooth and easily. This cut my morning routine in half. I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this brush.</li>
    <li> I love love this brush. My husband wanted his own brush so I kindly gave him the older brush and bought this one. Well it is awesome. I use it, my daughter uses it, and I catch my husband using it too. I had some shipping issues but they were with US mail, nothing to do with the seller. In fact the seller was very prompt in email response. I was nervous about international shipping but it made its way oversea a few weeks after I ordered the product.I recommend this brush and seller. Wonderful transaction. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush that we use on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  It is a great size for my purse.  I have several Mason Pearson products and they are all reliable and great for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> I received my Mason Pearson as a Christmas gift almost 20 years ago now.  I have fine medium length hair, my husband and daughter have long, thick hair. It is the only brush I have ever used, and my husband will only use it now too.  My young daughter repeatedly has asked for one.  But as they are so expensive it became a birthday gift for her this year.  It is the only gift I bought her AND SHE WAS THRILLED.  All the other little girls and Mom&#x27;s were very interested.... and shocked by the price.  But, these brushes don&#x27;t pull and they last FOREVER.  Now, I catch my husband in my daughter&#x27;s bathroom brushing his hair with her brush!  If you want the best- this is it. By the way, the junior size is a regular size hair brush.</li>
    <li> It is the best brush I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has become more beautiful and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this great brush!!!!!</li>
    <li> I first received my first Mason Pearson brush in 1983 as gift from my parents. Over the years of daily use, some of the bristles have understandably fallen out and the red rubber has become unglued. 30 years after the original purchase, I decided to it was time to treat myself and order the identical product. Excellent quality and well-worth the price. Hopefully I will have enough hair in three decades to merit another brush if necessary.</li>
    <li> Perfectly wonderful, as expected.</li>
    <li> My daughter had been wanting this brush for a long time, but soo expensive. I wish I had gotten it for her years ago! Her hair really is silkier. Now I want one. Birthday coming, hint, hint!</li>
    <li> This brush seriously has changed my hair around! It is so soft and shiny now. I was skeptical at first that a brush could do that much but you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
