<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was hoping this was the miracle for my seborrehic dermatitis that I have suffered for 4 years now. My wedding is coming up, and I chose to get off the steroid cream and on to something else. My dermatologist wasn&#x27;t being helpful so I wanted to try some things on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In trusting Amazon reviews, I purchased this. I didn&#x27;t want to spend crazy amounts of money on some &#x27;serum&#x27;, and was hoping something with natural ingredients would aid my woes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly found out that this wasn&#x27;t much of a moisturizer unless I caked it on. To the point that my face was white in the areas that I was suffering red, scaly skin. While it did hydrate my skin, and would help overnight in to the next day for part of the day, there are days that I continually have to reapply and reapply, sometimes as often as every 30 minutes if I&#x27;m not caking it on (something I didn&#x27;t want to do at work when I have to work with others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for positives with this product, I did notice that it has fixed some bumps that were on my face that seemed they would never go away. I believe one of them was an acne scar that felt like I had a bb under my skin. It has dramatically reduced the size of it, but it was only after I was creating a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping for it to work, but in my case, it just didn&#x27;t do what I needed it to.</li>
    <li> nice on the skin, soothing and absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product and would highly reccommend it to anyone with dry skin.It&#x27;s not greasy and does not iritate your skin</li>
    <li> I love the skin cream, great texture and it feels wonderful on my face. I can&#x27;t truthfully rate how beneficial it is until I use it a little longer, but the prospects are good</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely one of the best to relieve the sore, sunburned feeling from rosacea and takes away the horrific dry skin tightness of this skin problem.</li>
    <li> The seller was wonderful when I had some concerns about the item. The customer service with Red Rock was excellent. The cream has helped with the dry cracking and potential bleeding that can come with the winter. I would recommend this item if you get painfully dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything ! This creame is amazing</li>
    <li> I hate putting cream on my face. Its normally greasy, gets my hair dirty and always ends up sliding into my eyes because it doesn&#x27;t soak in. However living in Wisconsin, it is necessary because of the evil winter weather we experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me about this organic cream from Red Rock that she liked and was able to try it at a great price so I thought, why not? What I love most about this cream is that its not harsh on my skin, not that I have sensitive skin mind you. It actually soaks in and does not just sit on my face. So no sliding into my eyes and burning. The cream is not thick and really does a good job at moisturizing. Maybe I will even be able to skip a day? Best of all, a little goes along way. I even put some on my hands where I have super dry skin. I noticed in two days that it was soft, smooth and no more flaky skin on my keyboard.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for less that a week, but am in love!! It is very versatile, so you can use it for many issues. I am allergic to nickle so anytime the inside of the jeans button touches my belly, I break out in a horrible rash. It&#x27;s just gross. I generally try to wear a tank top under all shirts to prevent this, but sometimes I get in a hurry and forget. When I received this jar, I immediately applied it to my yucky spot on my stomach and felt instant relief. Within a matter of days (not the typical weeks), the rash was completely gone and my skin was healed. I also use this on my face as a moisturizer because I really like how well it absorbs into the skin. It does not feel heavy like a lot of lotions do and it does not leave your skin feeling greasy. There are a lot of really great ingredients packed into this little bottle so I plan on trying it out on my stretch marks as well. I read on the product site that this jar has about a 9 month shelf life, but if you keep it in the fridge it can last up to years. I do not plan on keeping this jar that long as I will enjoy using it daily!</li>
    <li> My skin has been extremely dry over the last few months and I haven&#x27;t found anything that keeps my skin moisturized all day and through the night. When I was offered this Red Rock Organics Manuka Honey Skin cream to try for a great deal and share my honest opinion, I decided to give it a try. I started using it as soon as I got it. After using it for just a few days, I started to notice that the dry cracked skin on my heels and fingers were clearing up. The cracks were sealed and my skin wasn&#x27;t peeling anymore! If you&#x27;re looking for a great skin cream, I definitely recommend this Red Rock Organics Manuka Honey Skin cream from Bio Fitness.</li>
    <li> i like this product it seems to be highly effective, goes on real nice and no odor, customer service is also above and beyond in their services as well,  my item arrived with damage and it was instanly replaced and sent out without even asking for a replacement  that is what i call good relations, always a repeat customer now !!</li>
    <li> As a mother of 3 children who suffer from eczema I am constantly on the lookout for a great cream or lotion to use for their skin.  So many of them have so many ingredients that I can’t even pronounce and the smell of some of them makes MY skin itch! I have never really truly found a product that my kids have said made their skin feel good. I jumped at the chance to try this product at a promotional price so that I could share our experience with it here for you. As soon as the jar arrived I opened it and smelled it and to my great surprise there was absolutely no scent!! That was a great first impression. I than took a little bit and rubbed it on my hand and it felt amazing, very thick and creamy. The real test though was on my kids’ legs and arms where their eczema is the worst. It went on very smooth and they said that it did not burn their skin at all like other lotions and creams have. I put this on them last night and this morning the redness has even subsided after just one application! This is like a miracle cream! I love this product!</li>
    <li> Works amaizing for exzema!</li>
    <li> Even though this cream is not emollient enough for my dry skin I felt the customer service was outstanding. I feel the ingredients are wonderful and it is a high quality product I just need to add argan oil to the cream so that it will address my dry skin.</li>
    <li> So soft and silky smooth. Really like the mild aroma and this cream absorbs to the skin faster and easier than other creams I’ve tried. My skin gets especially dry and cracked to the point of bleeding during the winter. But this cream is very soothing and healing. Would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I am ordering the second one. I love this cream, and it really lasts.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth!!  I wonder if it comes in a larger jar?</li>
    <li> Not impress with this product have not noticed any of the benefits this product promised. Waste  of my money I am really disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for about a week now. It&#x27;s very expensive though it doesn&#x27;t take much to apply where I need it. I have very dry skin, it may even be a form of rosaisa, and I wanted something to try to keep these areas from being dried out and flakey. So far it hasn&#x27;t done what I was hoping it would. I will keep using it for a few months and report again on how it works.  So far, even though it&#x27;s full of all kinds of &amp;#34;organics&amp;#34; and it seems to do ok on unaffected areas, it doesn&#x27;t seem to perform any better than OTC creams that are much cheaper. I would not recommend this cream to others because of the price at this time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cream!  It is very gentle, no smell, no greasy feel.  I would highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My 18 month old son suffers from severe eczema and I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural way to help improve his skin rather than constantly using the topical steroids that all the doctors were prescribing. The first time I put this on his skin, it just soaked it up...his skin went from feeling like alligator skin to feeling much softer and more moist. After using this product for a few weeks now, his skin quality has greatly improved (although he&#x27;s still itchy). This product is great for anyone really...it definitely makes my hands feel softer and smoother when I apply it to my son.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this product. Not only does it make my skin feel nourished but it is safe for my new born baby too. My son and I both have sensitive skin and this lotion has become part of our daily routine.</li>
    <li> This is a really good face cream, nice and thick and luxurious.  My favorite thing about it is that it does not have a fragrance.  I feel organic products shouldn&#x27;t be stinky, and this one fits the bill.  I know when I&#x27;m using it that I&#x27;m not giving my skin toxins, and I like that.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff! Soaks right in, leaving a glow and overall even-ness on the skin!</li>
    <li> The cream is the best for me.  I have had a pretty serious eczema&lt;br /&gt;for years and medically hasn&#x27;t helped me at all, only worsening after ointments&lt;br /&gt;and prescriptions.  Further, I have spent a small fortune for moisturising&lt;br /&gt;cream of all kinds and none has effective enough to prevent itchness especially&lt;br /&gt;at nights and in cold/chilly weather due to dryness.  Now I applied&lt;br /&gt;the cream once it got home yesterday and I and my skin already feel&lt;br /&gt;a lot better and mositurized with mininmal itchiness overnight.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this cream is that it does not contain&lt;br /&gt;any paraben or harmful additives of which a lot of mositurizing cream have&lt;br /&gt;in the market.  I think I will be regular customer from now on.</li>
    <li> Awesome cream! I have used on my legs after shaving, my feet, pretty much anywhere that has dry skin. I do not have eczema or any skin condition, just dry at times but this has worked wonders!</li>
    <li> I happened to get this cream just in time for dealing with a gnarly sunburn.  Oops.  It really seemed to help.  It soaked right in, and I used it several times throughout the day for relief as well as just to get moisture to my poor, fried skin.  I love that it is all natural, and has great healing ingredients.</li>
    <li> Good cream, I like the texture, it goes on smooth and does not feel greasy. No fragrance so it does not interfere with any perfume I use.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I love that it is organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a scent as well which is amazing. Most creams have a fragrance that bothers my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s not too oily, which is great!</li>
    <li> I love this cream from Red Rock Organics!! It tightens my skin immediately (AMAZING!); goes in (not on, but in) cleanly, and still, lightly. Other brands I&#x27;ve used just sit on the surface of my skin, but this cream effectively moisturizes deeply -- and a little really goes a long way. I&#x27;m noticing my facial skin tone evening out. It maintains a refreshing feel--a wonderful way to start the day or comfort me at night! I like that it&#x27;s unscented and doesn&#x27;t accost me with artificial fragrance or compete with my makeup. I like to be in control of the natural fragrances I use when I do, and feel that creams and fragrances serve two separate purposes that shouldn&#x27;t be combined in the same product. It&#x27;s the perfect base! I&#x27;m also using it on incision sites of a surgery I had two months ago and gradually seeing a swift return to my natural skin color and suppleness--I feel it must be assisting healing for those sites are not as sore and are regaining their elasticity/flexibility! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase; and the merchant ensured immediate delivery---to my delightful surprise, I received it the very next day. Thank you Red Rock Organics for, very simply, such superb service and product! I&#x27;m excited and am sharing here their website listed on the jar ( http://redrockorganics.net/ ) where I found much more informative detail and graphic understanding of the compound, ingredients, what makes it so effective; and, the people behind it, too. They are active on social media forums and provide open service-oriented communication--so important. This is a company of integrity and I&#x27;m so happy I found them! I&#x27;m getting the eye serum next! :D</li>
    <li> I started using Red Rock Skin Cream as of Tuesday, July 14, 2014.  Although I need a bit more time to evaluate the product, I do like the way it makes my face feel.  I have medium to dry skin, so this cream seems to be a good match.  I especially like the fact the product is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;ve only used this product for 2 full days. That being said, I can&#x27;t believe how well this product has worked for me. After spending so much time and money trying to get my skin problem under control; just trying to find a doctor who could figure out what the problem is took so long. And when your face is broken out, a day is too long. It&#x27;s been months and for someone who had always had \\&quot;great\\&quot; skin, months equalled an eternity. The terms Dermatitis and ezcema were used. All I know, it was itchy,oozing and scabby. I tried all kinds of remedies, from strong toxic alopathic drugs. To granola crunchy type remedies such as coconut oil on my face. The coconut oil on the face was the last one I used before this produced showed up. For me, it seemed like the coconut oil made my condition worse. After receiving the Red Rock cream in the mail, I applied it to my entire face and neck just before I went to bed. The first thing I noticed, how the cream seemed to soak into my skin. It was not greasy at all, it was actually very silky. Although I went to bed with what I would consider a large number of eruptions on my face, I woke up with no new ones. And the ones that were there seemed to be on the mend and no more itching. Prior to this cream, I actually thought this face problem was caused by food allergies. I went to an allergist and she didn&#x27;t seem to think I had food allergies. She said it was a skin problem. Which didn&#x27;t sit well with me, as far as I can tell, food allergies can cause skin problems. I got the results of my allergy blood test, not food allergies. I am however allergic to two types of dust mites.  So I&#x27;ve been eating all the foods I previously thought were causing these itchy, embarrassing breakouts. No new breakouts and no more oozing, itchy rash. I put this cream on every night, yes sleep with it on. And in the morning after my shower, I put the Red Rock cream on while my face is still moist, to help seal in the moisture. Apparentlydryness is what was causing my skin problem. I am thrilled to be eating my previously self imposed banished foods, who doesn&#x27;t like peanut butter? Oh yeah, I had a huge list of foods I took completely out of my diet, thinking they were the culprits. All nuts, corn and even popcorn. I thought they were the cuase of this unexplained rash. Now, by no means am I saying this is what you should do, everyone is different. So, before go self diagnose off of the internet (and we know we all do, you&#x27;re reading this aren&#x27;t you?), check with a professional.  I guess why I started this rambling was to say, for the past \\&quot;2\\&quot; days I have seen dramatic improvement in my skin. While it is not 100% healed, my face is well on the road to recovery. For the first time in months, I&#x27;m not embarrassed to leave my house. Although it&#x27;s shallow, I have to admit that my self esteem is directly linked to how well my skin looks. And with this Red Rock cream, both my skin and my self esteem are improving. For me, the cost of a jar of this cream is money very well spent. Heck, I&#x27;ve spent so much more on lotions, potions and pills. Not to mention doctor bills. And non of them have had the effectiveness of this jar of cream. I&#x27;m sitting here writing this on a lovely Saturday mornig because if my experience can help someone to heal, it was time well spent. I know how skin problems, especially on the face can make one feel depressed and isolated. I say do like I did and give this cream a try. Right now I can say, I&#x27;m so glad I did. Much thanks to Red Rock for their incredible product and to amazon for helping to distribute such a fantastic product. I will try to give a follow up review after I&#x27;ve had more time using this product. If I&#x27;m not too busy out enjoying the world again. Right now, this product is a game changer. It comes with a money back guarantee, so what do you really have to lose? Obviously you&#x27;re searching for something to help yourself, I found it in this cream.  Hope this review has helped, good luck to you. I&#x27;m no longer searching, which makes me one Happy Camper!</li>
    <li> I would love to give this 5 stars because it REALLY works. I love it, but what I don&#x27;t love is the smell... it reminds me of baby vomit. I would highly suggest adding your own essential oils to this to help out with the smell :) as far as the claims of being the best moisturizer, it is true :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MaryKay is a wonderful person and I highly recommend her products!! She is very one on one and wants to make sure you are happy with your purchase.</li>
    <li> What can I say? This product is so calming for my skin!  I am someone who has chronic dry and sensitive skin and I have found that the combination of the Honey with the aloe just does the trick to keep my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  Thank you for this!</li>
    <li> it is great to keep moisture,but it does not stop from eczema.</li>
    <li> Normally lotions have an ingredient (or more) that dries your skin out. This one doesn&#x27;t. I tried it and I love it. My skin soaks it right in, it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky, it&#x27;s smooth and silly and my skin feels wonderful. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> It says organic but its not certified...its ok. Its not nearly as moisturizing and amazing as it says. I was REALLY looking forward to using it but I put a big blob on and still feel dry its like my face sucks it in and its not soothing my skin. I have fairly oily skin too.</li>
    <li> Great service! Arrived really fast. Have been using it and already see a difference. My skin is much softer and I had a couple of very dry patches that are now gone.</li>
    <li> honestly this is the best cream.  i had dry flaky skin under my eyes on my cheeks forever and nothing worked. i never went to the doctor but i assume it was eczema or something like that. after one use my skin was smooth.  i apply after every shower, before i go to bed and once or twice during the day.  It honestly makes a huge difference. i never write reviews unless im pissed at the product but i love this so much i had to. get this product and don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
    <li> Loving this cream. Seeing a difference in my face and loving it. Also it doesn&#x27;t feel too thick on my face which for me is really nice.</li>
    <li> i&lt;br /&gt;I just got his but used it not even a week ,I feel improvement on my skin.Hope to get better.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was great.  I have very dry skin and after using this for just a few days, I already saw a difference.  And the effect doesn&#x27;t stop if you skip a day, which is important to me.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I use it on my body and my feet.  Sometimes I mix a little essential oils with it and it&#x27;s amazing. Not greasy at all and gets absorbs quickly. Really does a great job moisturizing my skin.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She was impressed with the cream. Thank you again</li>
    <li> Its winter and I can&#x27;t even wear a long sleeve shirt. My elbows are so dry and rough that they catch on everything. It feels uncomfortable and painful and nothing i have put on them has worked, so I just don&#x27;t bother. I literally used this cream one time and it was like magic. My elbows are hydrated! They are soft and not catching at all! I could not believe it. It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is so smooth. It&#x27;s like a whipped butter. It&#x27;s organic and made with manuka honey. It&#x27;s antiviral and antibacterial. The formula is rich and creamy. It is not at all greasy and rubs in so well. It leaves my skin so soft and moisturized. I am ecstatic I recieved this item to review. It is absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> This past week I was sick looking in the mirror it was horrible my face was dried out and itchy. Oh so itchy! I washed it a few times but nothing helped then I remembered I got me a bottle of Red Rock Organics at a cheap price to try out. I ran and got the jar and instantly I felt relief from the itching. No more itching I was already phrasing how much I worship this cream before even seeing how amazing my skin looked after. My skin was not dried up anymore it was plump and full of life I was back to looking like myself again. I swear by this product now. I keep a little jar in my bathroom with it while the full container stays in the fridge to prolong the life as I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it in my house.</li>
    <li> Do you have any type of skin issues? If so,you will definitely want to use this skin cream.This cream has awesome ingredients in it to help with your skin. It has Manuka Honey,it helps to destroy bacteria and they use it in the hospital for burns.It also contains the ingredient called Old Man Weed.This helps with skin irritations and also helps with the pain associated with the irritation.I was so I was so excited when I received this product to review for my unbiased opinion.I would purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;I some times get dry skin and then I start scratching and as we all know that leads to irritation.Applied this on a few times and it is great. It took away the irritation plus the pain that I had from the scratching and irritation.It has aloe,shea butter and cocoa butter in it.So, you know that it leaves your skin feeling renewed and so soft. This is truly a great skin cream!</li>
    <li> Purchased thinking it would be similar to Egyptian or Sweet Blessed Bee Magic ( my personal fave). This has a much more creamy consistency, which apparently is the olive oil base.  It&#x27;s so-so not the best. I&#x27;ll go back to my beloved Sweet Blessed Bee Magic when this one it gone.</li>
    <li> I found this cream about 6 weeks ago and saw most of the review were so positive.  It is inexpensive compared to other products that I have used for years.  So I decided to ordered 10 jars (the guarantee of money back for me to free safe to do so); 4 went to my mother-in -law and 3 sisters-in-law, 1 to my 24 year old daughter and couple of close friends and the rest are for my husband and I.  Everyone of them was very pleased even my 24 year old daughter who is picky and did not care for the other products that I was using....haha.  My daughter especially has had breaking out on her face, and she told me that only over one night after putting this cream on her face changed to an even color, no more break out and smoother.  I was so happy to hear that because again mom knows best and I was able to help my daughter! ....haha.    I try to use organic food and GMO free pure products for my family.  I have always used excellent but expensive skincare products and did not think a less expensive product could work just as well, and it has.    Now that I have confidence in MaryKay Carr&#x27;s Red Rock product, I also purchased her new line of eye serum (if use the promote  code \\&quot;honeyeye\\&quot; the eye serum is only $ 9.99 instead of $ 39.95 I hope the code still works, good luck).  I want to wait for a few more weeks before I will write a review on it.  I am hopeful that it works as well as this cream!    I had a concern on the pump bottle of the eye serum that I ordered.  The owner of Red Rock, MaryKay Carr took immediate action to handle it  attentively, I really appreciate the 10+ service from her.</li>
    <li> Good, keeps skin moist</li>
    <li> NON greasy nice non-fragrant lotion. Your skin feels so soft and fantastic. I have eczema and this cream is so soothing. You will notice a difference in your skin so please give this a try. I highly recommend this all natural skin cream. Hard to find a product these days that&#x27;s not full of all different kinds of cheicals and preservatives. Thank you REDROCK for caring!!! Your fantastic!</li>
    <li> i love it this may be my forever moisturizer</li>
    <li> Love this product.  In fact I just bought two more jars.  And I bought the eye serum but it&#x27;s too soon to give an opinion.  The skin cream works better on my arms (which could be likened to crepe paper) than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything including very expensive creams.  I&#x27;m thinking short sleeve blouses again.</li>
    <li> It irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> I was really worried about trying something and not being able to return it, but this lotion is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it for just a few days and already see an improvement with my acne. No greasy feeling, just moisture where you need it and it heals your skin fast</li>
    <li> This is an OUTSTANDING product! The courteous and caring Seller also followed up with more helpful information including shelf life, as it is a natural creation,  very thoughtful!  Not only does this work well, the cream has a wonderful scent and an absolutely delightful fluffy and smooth texture, really creamy dreamy! Makes me happy just using it several times a day and night! LOVE IT! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Red Rock Organics has won me over with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, dry skin and I also have allergies to certain things. I cannot use most other commercially available skin products and I cannot use fabric softener -- my skin will break out! Especially in the winter, itchy rashes appear on my lower legs. If I&#x27;m travelling and use a hotel&#x27;s moisturizer (we&#x27;re talking about good hotels here, like the Hyatt, Westin, Swiss etc,) my skin will break out due to whatever chemicals are in those moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to applying products on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for skin cream that contained manuka honey (due to its healing properties) and was happy to see Cacoa Seed Butter, Manuka Honey, and Shea Butter as the first three ingredients in this product. Other brands advertise manuka honey but there are a bunch of chemicals list ahead of the honey ingredient -- no thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY happy to see that this product contained &amp;#34;No Fragrance, No Mineral Oil or Alcohol, No Parabens&amp;#34; !!! Dream come true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company really does live by its 100% Money Back Satisfaction Guaranteed. I mistakenly thought I was providing feedback for the &amp;#34;Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Body Lotion&amp;#34; (avoid!), and said that I didn&#x27;t like it due to the strong fragrance. The company&#x27;s CEO MK Carr immediately apologized and offered a refund because I was not satisfied. But she did mention that this product did not contain any unnatural fragrance. When I realized my error I apologized but was happy to see that a good company is making a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of use, I am HAPPY to say that I no longer have to reach down and scratch my itchy legs. The quality of life improvement alone is worth it. But now my skin feels much healthier and livelier ... just helps me feel better overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Red Rock and MK Carr!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream.  Best thing about it, is no perfume smell.  Absorbs quickly into the skin, great under make.  I highly recommended this product if you hate creams that smell like a perfume store and have a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream.I use it on my neck, and my face. It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizing  skin cream you wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed. It helped me with my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Decided to try the product again. The product is very thick. Applying a small amount to the skin does allow for absorption, not leaving a cake-y layer. It does not produce a shine like most moisturizers. In regards to whether or not my face is well moisturized, I can&#x27;t say for sure....but it does have organic ingredients, so I assume nature knows best...? However, i did notice i grew small pimples on my face after a few days so I discontinued.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few days ago and I&#x27;ve been using it daily. I have noticed that my skin is softer, and silky. I would recommend this product to my friends &amp; family absolutely. It also makes my tattoo shiny and more vibrant :)</li>
    <li> This cream is very rich so only takes a little bit to moisturize my skin. Has absolutely zero fragrance too which is nice. I love it! I use it following the shower and it keeps my skin moisturizer and soft much longer than store-bought brands I had been using. Recommended!</li>
    <li> great moisturizer! i have tried the high end brands...this is far better...natural...my skin loves it....so glad i found it...</li>
    <li> I am very much enjoying the manuka honey cream. I am a fan of manuka honey in general but have been using this on my face, neck and other areas with skin issues. I am already seeing improvement. I bought 2 jars as I wanted my daughter and 10 year old grandson, who both have eczema, to try it as well. They both say they feel immediate relief from the itching and dryness and my grandson says it is the first lotion that doesn&#x27;t burn or smell bad when he puts it on.</li>
    <li> Good product but small container</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> The seller sent this aloe vera skin cream promptly,  I use this cream to help keep my skin stay soft and supple.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love this cream. It makes my skin feel like a rose petal! And it&#x27;s not greasy! Will definitely buy again! :-) Thank you!! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product. No perfume. Organic ingredients and feels great on my skin. Being pregnant I&#x27;ve been doubling up on it and my skin feels really soft. Definitely recommend this product for those who are very attentive to ingredients and their health and want a great product that doesn&#x27;t feel caked on and the skin absorbs it fast.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream! Stays on well and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I like that it doesn&#x27;t come off easy and that it lasts.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as it&#x27;s described.  Unscented, a little goes a long way, and it absorbs fast enough that you aren&#x27;t left with any greasy, damp feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to try to fix my husband&#x27;s terrible &amp;#34;winter itch.&amp;#34;  This cream is not advertised for winter itch, but I&#x27;m trying everything.  While this did heal my husband&#x27;s skin (red bumps, welts, scales all went away, his skin is softer and supple) it only relieved the itching for a few hours.  So it didn&#x27;t cure the itch, but as I said his skin is much, much healthier and it does give him some relief we just have to keep applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had abdominal surgery three months ago leaving me with three thick, dark purple scars.  I use this cream on those scars and after just a month all three are thinner, less firm, and have noticeably faded.  This cream is amazing and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This was purchased during a promotional price in exchange for a honest opinion and review. This was smooth, and creamy and the smell is wonderful. It soaked into my skin so well. I have extremely dry skin and this soaked in and made my skin so soft and when my skin is really dry it hurts this took alot of it away Not all of it but alot. That means a great deal when it comes to lotion. Plus when my skin is properly  hydrated it looks so much younger. This is a definite find that will be purchased again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a face cream that doesn&#x27;t clog pores, is all natural, helps my severely dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t mess up my makeup application. This is EVERYTHING I was looking for. I LOVE it! My skin is starting to clear up, get softer and more even toned. I&#x27;ll never use anything else again!</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to all creams/cosmetics, this cream made my face burn on first application and gave me terrible migraine, had to return it</li>
    <li> This is the same product as several others that are being sold on Amazon under different brands. Although the cream itself is ok, I am skeptical of the same cream being labeled under several brands.</li>
    <li> While I do tend to have dry skin, it has been particularly dry this winter. My hands get dry to the point that cracks form on my  fingers and hands. It is very uncomfortable and embarrassing. Some creams I&#x27;ve tried gave temporary relief, while other perfumey creams made my skin even worse. Department store creams leave my skin feeling drier than what it was before. I was so excited when I found Manuka Honey Skin Cream at a great price and decided to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, I noticed how much thicker Manuka cream is versus other creams. It has a very mild scent and soothed my skin immediately after applying it. Since using this cream on a regular basis, I&#x27;ve noticed that my eczema has cleared significantly and my skin isn&#x27;t as itchy.  I also love that this cream is anti viral and anti bacterial properties. My skin is protected in more ways than one! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no secret that I have a ton of tattoos, and I decided the other day to put some of this on them to help make the colors pop again (you know... how that black never seems to be as bold after tattoos heal) and this is awesome for that it helps my tattoos colors pop again and be super soft, and appear hydrated. My son has eczema on his left leg and above both butt cheeks and I have been using this on him as well and it really is helping, its no where near as red, scaly and itchy for him as it was, and im sure in another day or two of use (applying 2 or 3 times a day)  it will be gone. I love that this product is organic! It goes on smooth as butter and absorbs quickly leaving my skin feeling hydrated and looking much better!</li>
