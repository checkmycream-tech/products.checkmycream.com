### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nivea is the best deodrant ever.</li>
      <li>Nivea is a great product.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this stuff to any guy, unless you don&#x27;t like smelling good.</li>
      <li>and I loved the smell and the way it worked.</li>
      <li>good quality and design.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and does keep the under arm smell at bay for 24hrs.  </li>
      <li>I liked the way it smells, very cool and sports like smell, just like it says.</li>
      <li>I was very glad to see that this spray is available on Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and I wish it were sold in more U.S. stores, but I am not sure many stores would provide the superior customer service that Simply Beautiful did.  </li>
      <li>Bought the 3 pack, so I have 2 more..</li>
      <li>That is more than I can say for any of the US made products.</li>
      <li>Now I am out and need to find more.</li>
      <li>I used mostly Nivea for Men products and came across this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous and by far the the best Mens anti-perspirant I ever used.</li>
      <li>Simply Beautiful was great about responding quickly and sending me a replacement order within a few days.</li>
      <li>easy on the skin and stays longer through the day.</li>
      <li>Not to strong either.</li>
      <li>Delivery was prompt and smooth.</li>
      <li>Will buy more pretty soon.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is great and keeps me dry all day.</li>
      <li>In this reviewers opinion the smell is more appealing than Axe or other popular deodorant body sprays and it keeps odor and perspiration down to a minimum much more effectively.</li>
      <li>If you like the original right guard smell you will like this one.</li>
      <li>The best.smell very good and last longer.48 hours protection.i only buy this one now.</li>
      <li>It smells fresh, lasts longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, doesn&#x27;t change the color after you apply it</li>
      <li>This is a rare commodity in the USA.</li>
      <li>Liked it so much that I brought back 6 cans with me.  </li>
      <li>There are a few different scents available from Nivea and each one of them smells and works great.</li>
      <li>The U.S. Post Office lost the first shipment and</li>
      <li>Smells like old school Right Guard spray.  </li>
      <li>I prefere the blue one, but this one does its job just fine, totally recomendable.</li>
      <li>; I was able to purchase about 20-30 of these in total for 6 bucks or less.</li>
      <li>Before leaving Germany I bought a few full size cans to take home with me as I&#x27;d never seen this stuff for sale Stateside before.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t go back to Right Guard or any other.</li>
      <li>Instead of helping you smell better when you perspire they make you smell worse.</li>

    <li> I like this product a lot although it&#x27;s hard for me to press the spray button with my arthritic hands. Also, the individual cans are somewhat smaller than other brands and don&#x27;t seem to last is long.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Good products&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Bought this deodorant while on vacation in Costa Rica.  I had suddenly developed a painful rash using my regular Mitchum stick deodorant. Looked for a spray type, and this was one of the few I could find.  Liked it so much that I brought back 6 cans with me.  Now I am out and need to find more. Hope it comes back to this site soon!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I wish it were sold in more U.S. stores, but I am not sure many stores would provide the superior customer service that Simply Beautiful did.  The U.S. Post Office lost the first shipment and Simply Beautiful was great about responding quickly and sending me a replacement order within a few days.</li>
    <li> I picked up a sample size can of this stuff while on a trip to Germany and I loved the smell and the way it worked. I did not perspire as much and the scent of the spray remained strong enough to cover up any unpleasant underarm B.O. Before leaving Germany I bought a few full size cans to take home with me as I&#x27;d never seen this stuff for sale Stateside before. I was very glad to see that this spray is available on Amazon.com. In this reviewers opinion the smell is more appealing than Axe or other popular deodorant body sprays and it keeps odor and perspiration down to a minimum much more effectively. There are a few different scents available from Nivea and each one of them smells and works great. My girlfriend goes crazy about the smell of this stuff, too. I would recommend this stuff to any guy, unless you don&#x27;t like smelling good.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t cause allergies.Isnt too harsh on skin and the smell is subtle.</li>

    <li> So far I cannot say anything bad about this product... It smells nice and does keep the under arm smell at bay for 24hrs.  It is winter where I am and quiet cold.  Have to wait for summer to see if it does keep the under arm smell away as well.  Bought the 3 pack, so I have 2 more.. Pity the US does not these product here.</li>
    <li> Smells like old school Right Guard spray.  If you like the original right guard smell you will like this one. Delivery was prompt and smooth.</li>
    <li> That is more than I can say for any of the US made products. Instead of helping you smell better when you perspire they make you smell worse. Nivea is a great product.</li>
    <li> Not really good product&lt;br /&gt;It somehow creates white spots on cloths&lt;br /&gt;This dies not happen with my regular brute that i get from walmart</li>
    <li> I liked the way it smells, very cool and sports like smell, just like it says. Not to strong either.</li>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> not a good product. when sprayed, left white residue on the skin. maybe the long shipping duration might have something to do with it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it in the US. The best.smell very good and last longer.48 hours protection.i only buy this one now.</li>
    <li> Will buy more pretty soon. I prefere the blue one, but this one does its job just fine, totally recomendable.</li>
    <li> Fabulous and by far the the best Mens anti-perspirant I ever used. The fragrance is great and keeps me dry all day.</li>
    <li> This is a rare commodity in the USA. I dont find it on any store shelf.&lt;br /&gt;Nivea is the best deodrant ever. I have tried a gazillion other products.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy on the skin and stays longer through the day.</li>
    <li> Nivea for Men Sport Deodorant Antiperspirant Spray (150ml)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for years after I&#x27;ve unsuccessfully tried to find a local brand that is comparable to these European products. It smells fresh, lasts longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, doesn&#x27;t change the color after you apply it so what not to like? Shop around until you find it from a seller who is not charging fortune for shipping; I was able to purchase about 20-30 of these in total for 6 bucks or less.</li>
