      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>glad I bought the sampler kit</li>
      <li>I got this sample pack, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many containers for travel and all of them leaked product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered the sampler so that I could see if it worked for me</li>
      <li>Great product works well with natural hair</li>
      <li>I moisturizes her hair really well, makes it easy to comb through, and smells nice.</li>
      <li>I give it 3 stars because the products are too light for my hair texture-3c 4a and it is also winter time</li>
      <li>So far, so good</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get a FULL size...</li>
      <li>I plan on buying more of these and giving them as gifts to my natural friends to try.  </li>
      <li>So I got this sample kit pretty quickly and was very excited to use, but my excitement soon ended when I actually used it...</li>
      <li>The spray is divine, and the moisturizer is on of the best I&#x27;ve used on my 4a hair, Unfortunately I cannot use the moisturizer because of the lavender.</li>
      <li>This would be a great product for dry climate only for me.</li>

      <li>I already bought a new sets of the individuals.</li>
      <li>but it was very soft.  </li>
      <li>Products is natural, None greasy, not heavy and don&#x27;t stain your pillow.</li>
      <li>The spray bottle needs a firm grip to hold and the cream is too light.</li>
      <li>I had just washed my hair &amp; it was already soft &amp; hydrated from my leave in conditioner...</li>
      <li>I bought it to try on my hair, for  a natural style but ended up using it on my little girls hair first.</li>

<li> Hands down.</li>
<li> the curl moisture cream did make my hair soft but also left behind the white residue and the Spray smells awful unless you prefer the smell of old roses....</li>
<li> WASTE of money, time &amp; effort:(&lt;br /</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like hospital lotion... :/</li>
<li> I tested this stuff &amp; It was very DRYING &amp; caused my hair to KNOT terribly...</li>
<li> it makes my hair frizzy and leaves this nasty white residue on my hair and is hard to get out unless you wash it...</li>
<li> but I tend to shy away from it.  </li>
<li> the curl enhancing custard  is terrible</li>

    <li> The curl creme is pretty good, BUT the smell is AWFUL.  It&#x27;s like hospital lotion... :/</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!! Hands down.</li>
    <li> Still working with it. So far, so good</li>
    <li> The curl enhancing custard is the best for a twist out! No product has given me such loose curls and smoothness at the same time. The trial pack lasts for quite a while. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> I got this sample pack, and I love it. I bought it to try on my hair, for  a natural style but ended up using it on my little girls hair first. I moisturizes her hair really well, makes it easy to comb through, and smells nice. Because I got such a small amount I have just let her have it, but I will be ordering the larger sizes of each of these items so we can both use them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this sample pack.... Thank GOD I didn&#x27;t get a FULL size...WASTE of money, time &amp; effort:(&lt;br /&gt; I have type 4c coily hair....I had just washed my hair &amp; it was already soft &amp; hydrated from my leave in conditioner...I tested this stuff &amp; It was very DRYING &amp; caused my hair to KNOT terribly...I had to wash my hair all over to get it out! UGGh!</li>
    <li> So I got this sample kit pretty quickly and was very excited to use, but my excitement soon ended when I actually used it...the curl enhancing custard  is terrible it makes my hair frizzy and leaves this nasty white residue on my hair and is hard to get out unless you wash it...the curl moisture cream did make my hair soft but also left behind the white residue and the Spray smells awful unless you prefer the smell of old roses....glad I bought the sampler kit cause I definitely would&#x27;ve been pissed if I  wasted my money on this</li>
    <li> The price was reasonable for a trial pack. You get to try them out without too much commitment. I tried this product a few different ways but didn&#x27;t get good results.</li>
    <li> I give it 3 stars because the products are too light for my hair texture-3c 4a and it is also winter time so it is not holding the moisture the way it should in my hair. The spray bottle needs a firm grip to hold and the cream is too light.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Exactly what I was looking for, for my natural hair up keep.  Shipping was fast.  I received it before the estimated delivery day. I already bought a new sets of the individuals. Products is natural, None greasy, not heavy and don&#x27;t stain your pillow. This is my hair product for life.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair products! My favorite is the custard!. The spray is divine, and the moisturizer is on of the best I&#x27;ve used on my 4a hair, Unfortunately I cannot use the moisturizer because of the lavender. Highly reccommend this line!</li>
    <li> Glad I ordered the sampler so that I could see if it worked for me and it does not.  This line of products does not work for me.</li>
    <li> This product was very moisturizing.  A little goes a long way.  Unfortunately, I used it while on a trip and the climate was very humid therefore my hair won&#x27;t hold any curls (definition) but it was very soft.  This would be a great product for dry climate only for me. I could add some gel for additional hold but I tend to shy away from it.  I give it 4 stars only because of the hold factor.  Otherwise, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product works well with natural hair</li>
    <li> perfect size, perfect price.  I plan on buying more of these and giving them as gifts to my natural friends to try.  I love the Obia line - so glad I found it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying to get my lotions and hair products in a travel form.  I&#x27;ve purchased many containers for travel and all of them leaked product.&lt;br /&gt;This twist on cap with the perfect size is great for on the go.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying these products!</li>
