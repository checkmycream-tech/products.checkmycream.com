<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about Herstyler products but they always smell great &amp; perform beautifully. The Argan Oil line was no exception. My hair came out silky smooth &amp; smelling fantastic. Just 1 use &amp; my hair looked better than it had in weeks. I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market &amp; Herstyler products are the only thing that make my hair look this healthy &amp; smooth. Even when combined with other shampoos &amp; conditioners the Argan Oil Serum kept my hair shiny &amp; soft. The price is so reasonable on Amazon I can&#x27;t see using anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is a great starter set if you&#x27;re new to the line. Just enough shampoo &amp; conditioner to last for a few weeks &amp; a large bottle of serum that will last months. I highly recommend this kit &amp; all the Herstyler products.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product and I love the way my hair feels when I use it.</li>
    <li> I usually buy my hair products from the local store but decided to browse on amazon because my hair has been in desperate need of some TLC from recent over processing.  This purchase was worth it and I wish I would&#x27;ve done it sooner. Great products.  Part of the experience is how nice everything smells...especially the serum.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> awesome product! does great job and smells wonderful! highly recommended! pricing is very reasonable and affordable. will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit at an incredible price on amazon.  I found the product through those mall kiosk and the girl gave me a brief overview and treatment of the oil.  I really loved it!  Not to brag, but I have beautiful long hair and am extremely meticulous with taking care of it.  The girl wanted to sell it to me for $75!  WHAT??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME???  I knew I would find it on amazon for a lot less!  And I did, like a fraction of what the kiosk girl was going to sell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are great products, too.  The only drawback is that the tubes are not enough for my incrdedibly long hair.  But the serum lasts a long time.  My hair is super thick and past my waist.  I only need less than a pump of it and I start with the ends and work my way up but 4&amp;#34; to 5&amp;#34; away from my scalp.  I use the flat iron on it and voila!  Take a look at my facebook page at Rubi DePompa and you will see my hair!</li>
    <li> This product transforms hair, especially long hair, into smooth, silky beautifully smelling hair. The stressed hair ends are nourished to allow an easy to comb out. Best product I have ever found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have mixed hair (curly/frizz).. I&#x27;ve been missing out by not using argon oil.  My hair feels and looks great; definitely a difference from using regular sheen.  It felt like my press lasted longer as well and looked better; doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all.  Great product! Will definitely be ordering more.  I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo/conditioner once, so no major opinion on it yet.  Buy the oil though, you won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
    <li> These products really work. My hair is shiny and healthy.  I get alot of compliments from strangers about how pretty my hair is.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...I was really surprised that the items were sealed ensuring they are authentic.  Worth the money! Thanks</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product. It makes my hair feels so soft and light. I have very thick hair and I have a very hard time finding quality product. Also, if you try and buy this at a mall kiosk, it will easily be over $100!&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I loveeeee the way this stuff smells! It&#x27;s amazing. Although its not making my hair as soft as I expected 13 bucks is wellll worth the price for this trio. Wayyyyyyyyyyyy cheaper than the mall as well!</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago I received a sample packet of this serum at the mall. I tried it and I was hooked. My hair never looked so good.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately ordered this set and got it within 4 days. My hair is very fine, thin and a bit on the limp side, but this product gives me great volume, shine and body. I got a lot of compliments on how different my hair looks. I dye my hair dark red and the serum gives it a nice glow and deepens the color too.  I use a blow dryer almost every day and it protects my hair from the heat. Also, I noticed less friz..  I  recommend this product 100%.  Oh, I forgot, the fragrance of this serum is amazing.</li>
    <li> i love this product. it makes my hair feel, smell &amp; look amazing!!!! i totally recommend it to anyone! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The price is awesome comparing to what you have to pay at the mall. Love the hair oil, works like magic. I use it for myself, my 11 years old, and my twin girls since they were 1 1/2 years old. Not sure if I like the shampoo, it&#x27;s a little too thick. The hair treatment conditional is alright. I bought this mainly for the hair oil.</li>
    <li> I have never try this product before, but when I got it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was,it was silky, smooth and shiny, since that day I haven&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
    <li> This kit is simply great!  Makes my dry, brittle, thin hair shinny and smooth.  You can see the difference in just one use.  I will forever use this product from now on!</li>
    <li> Works well with my hair, I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell but you really can&#x27;t beat the price and the shine it gives your hair. Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Love HerStyler! Great on my hair and a good price. Leaves hair feeling very smooth, especially when used with the serum.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I color my hair regularly, which is my only indulgence against my age. My hair use to feel like straw. Now it feels soft &amp; silky. It always looks like I came out of the salon.</li>
    <li> I tried this product before and loved it. They retail for over 100 $ ! This is a best deal i found on amazon.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter had over highlighted her hair and it was brittle and breaking off.  I had received a sample of this oil from the salon, so we gave it a try.  I could not believe the difference!!  I immediately logged on Amazon and was so pleased to see this set.  Her hair went from brittle/breaking/frizzy to soft and smooth.  This is a great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> So the products are overall amazing!!! Yet, by the look of it, I had thought the set cane with a shampoo and conditioner. The kit only incoudes a travel size shampoo, serum, and hair treatment.</li>
    <li> I love herstyler products. Amazon is the go to place to but their products. Much cheaper than in the middle of the malls. The shampoo is really great. The argan oil hair masc makes your hair so soft and healthy feeling. The argan oil hair serum is AMAZING!! I put it on when I get out of the shower and when my hair is dry before I straighten it.</li>
    <li> So I first found out about this product when I went to SF last month, I was walking around the mall and a girl decided to pull me aside and do my hair in one of those little booths! I fell in love with the hair straightener so my BF decided to buy it for me! Anyway, the girl used this argan oil and gosh it made my hair feel soooo soft and shiny! she gave me sooo many samples! I wanted to buy the bottle but that was $35, I went online and I found the whole set for less than $20! I bought it and I am soo happy with it!</li>
    <li> My dry damaged color treated hair loves this stuff. Makes my hair manageable and soft. Great price and I highly recommend. Especially if you have fine wavy hair like me</li>
    <li> have used it for some time love the product great price and fast shipment</li>
    <li> Keeps hair very soft and shiny. Smells absolutely awful!</li>
    <li> Great Product. Its Light and not oily and really helps your hair grow.  I loved it. But be careful and dont mix up teh Vitamin E product witht eh Argan oil product. The Argan oil is in a brown box, the vitamin E is in a black box.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my mothers friend and she absolutely loves it.  Her hair looks a lot healthier</li>
    <li> My daughter has had a difficult time finding hair care products that work as advertised.  This product worked well. She really liked it.</li>
    <li> Addictive frangrance! Adore the serum, like the shampoo and conditioner. Overall great products at reasonable prices compared to comparable hair products. Definitely worth trying. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> My friend paid a lot of money for this set in Cali on vacation.  She loved it and told me about it.  I searched and found on Amazon.  Great price.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair besides make it smell nice</li>
    <li> Love this brand and recommend to anyone with dry or frizzy hair. It makes my wavy/curly hair soft, smooth, and shiny. Also personally love the scent. Best prices I have ever seen for these and they last a good while making this a great value. This and Loreal brand evercreme are my shower essetials.</li>
    <li> My hair feels sooo much healthier and worth very penny</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I have very fine hair and it looks great without making my hair oily.  Calms down fried ends from flat iron.</li>
    <li> 10 bucks for all this? Dirt cheap, can&#x27;t beat it, been using the oil for years, just tried the mask, I&#x27;m in love, will order dozens more.</li>
    <li> Saw this product recommended on Youtube Elle Bangs and it works well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and the only reason why I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5, is that the shampoo smell is rather pungent and earthy. I don&#x27;t really care for it. The oil itself comes in an attractive bottle and is very easy to pump out. Love the oil serum. The conditioner is also very nice. Like how the product works. It is also safe for color-treated hair and at first glance, looks to be from a responsible company.</li>
    <li> these are the best products on the market and I have tried (sooooo many) Hope they stay around for a long time.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of the Argan Oil and loved it, so I figured I&#x27;d like the shampoo and mask as well. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t foam up at all so I actually had to mix it with regular shampoo to avoid wasting it, and the hair mask was so thick I couldn&#x27;t squeeze it through the tube. I had to take the cap off, and then once I did, it came out so quickly that I wasted it. Plus, I had to mix that with a conditioner to spread it anyway. The oil however, is fantastic and comes in a really nice glass pump. I wish I&#x27;d just bought the oil, because it works so well to make my hair shiny and strong, and repair split ends, but the shampoo and mask just weren&#x27;t worth the extra money. I think I&#x27;ll save them to use when my hair is really damaged or something but I think they&#x27;re kind of a waste. Also, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, it smells very strongly of chemicals and kind of overpowers everything else. But still the oil is great to use on the ends of your hair to keep them looking healthy and your hair shiny and tangle/frizz free.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft, shiny and manageable. It helps cut down on blow drying time. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used ( the hair serum)! It&#x27;s $50 on the HerStyler website, but Amazon sells it at a reasonable price. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, long, and frizzy. This serum does wonders to smooth it as I wash and straighten my hilited hair every day. The serum also holds up in the humidity without weighing it down. A little drop goes a long way, too. Lastly, I read some reviews where the customers expected vitamin E serum and received Argan Oil instead. I have both (Vitamin E is silver and Argan is brown labeled). I see no difference in the product- they feel the same, smell the same, and give the same result. If they stop making this product, I will have a meltdown!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Will be buying  more of it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic adds moisture and body to hair. Would recommend for dry, lifeless, dull hair. The Hair Mask is the best product I have used on my hair in a long time.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t a complete miracle worker but it did make my dyed-blonde hair feel more moisturized and shiny. I also like the smell of the argan oil and will repurchase as it&#x27;s such a good combo for the price!</li>
    <li> this is a great product and a seemingly great value,would recommend this to anyone looking for a new product to try</li>
    <li> The packaging that it comes in looks pretty enough to give it as a gift.  And I love the oil and the shampoo and conditioner.  It works very well for my hair making it soft and shiny and the oil protects against split ends.  I buy this stuff all the time..</li>
    <li> This is super inexpensive, doesnt leave your hair greasy at all, and a little bit goes a long way! The serum is in a glass bottle though...and looks like it could break if you take it traveling/ keep it in your purse..</li>
    <li> These three products really work well together and don&#x27;t weigh hair down or build up over time.  The serum really helps tame fly-aways too.  Argan oil is supposedly a good heat protectant so I use a drop of serum before and after flat ironing.  Works great for me :)</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal compared to the prices at the kiosk. I got sets for my sister, my mother, and me. My sister had very ruined hair from bleaching and frying her hair and after the first treatment, she got great results. My mother colors her hair, but it gets oily everyday, so she&#x27;ll use the serum but not the shampoo. She uses the hair mask once a week and it keeps her hair moisturized. I have pretty healthy hair; I sometimes straighten or curl it, but don&#x27;t color it. I use all three products and they make my hair so much softer and shiny and healthy. I have had these since August and I&#x27;m running out, so I am definitely going to repurchase this kit.</li>
    <li> Amazing products. fantastic price!!!!!</li>
    <li> MY HAIR IS SUUUUPER DRY AND WHEN I USED IT AND IT AMAZING! ITS CHEAP AND WORKS REALLY GOOD!!!!! IF YOUR HAIR FLIPS WHEN YOU STRAIGHTEN IT LIKE MINE DID I SAY GET IT LIKE NOOOOWWWW!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, love the smell and the feel, I have bright red hair and this stuff dosent strip my hair or make it dry. Its my new favorite.</li>
    <li> HerStyler argan oil is by far my favorite hair product when it comes to providing my hair with a shiny soft bounce without it looking greasy. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair at all and a little goes a long way. The shampoo and conditioning mask was only an added bonus! I have tried Chi, Biosilk, and Moroccan products. Trust me, this is the best in quality for an amazing price.</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow.  I love this stuff and it does wonders for your hair.  Excellent Excellent Price.</li>
    <li> The product delivered what it said it would. My hair is soft, shiny, and healthy looking. Additionally, the serum is effective against humidity</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The sMell is way too strong and overbearing. I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair while using this, but my allergies cerainly do!</li>
    <li> only used the shampoo and conditioner once so far because i had a keratin straightening treatment done which came with its own shampoo and conditioner, so i switched. but i&#x27;m thinking of switching back because these products shouldn&#x27;t effect my treatments length anyway. I still use the little bottle of argan oil and love it. it makes my hair feel angel soft and silky smooth along with the keratin treatment. not too oily at all, it absorbs right in to my damp hair and i blow dry / comb it out to be straight right after the shower. Definitely minimizes my getting ready time each morning.</li>
    <li> All of these products are wonderful, and I was not expecting much. The Shampoo has the most wonderful thick lather. The conditioner mask makes my hair soft, silky, strong, and truly makes me feel like a hair model. The serum is the only one I can use as much as I want of and not have to worry about my roots getting greasy and it makes my hair like silk. But the best part about all of these products is the smell. OH MY GOODNESS, THAT SMELL! The smell is very strong, nice, and lasts ALL day. Will definitely be repurchasing this!</li>
    <li> Wonderful &amp; would purchase again.  Just as described, made my hair soft and was not frizzy.  It DID NOT make my hair oily feeling or looking.</li>
    <li> Great price.... Great product. I love using this product but it&#x27;s so expensive, I was very happy to see it at this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these products before and loved them but this time it seemed like they were different.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this set! I have gotten the serum before and when I ran out I searched for it and I found this set with shampoo and conditioner too and for only a few bucks more then if I had just bought just the serum I figured I&#x27;d try it out. Best decision ever! I used the shampoo and condition and it made my hair so smooth and the smell! I could smell my own hair all day I loved it! My only complaint is that there wasn&#x27;t more! For only $10 this was a deal I highly recommed it!</li>
    <li> Love the Herstyler products.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really works very well.</li>
    <li> I never tried this before, but I&#x27;m sure It will do the job for my hair, i trust Herstyler and i trust Amazon, thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit if you wanna try this product, but you will get hooked on the shampoo and conditioner. The oil is not heavy, or weighs down my hair which I like a lot. I have thick and a lot of hair, and this product not only softens it, it keeps the natural frizzies under control too. Perfect Size for traveling too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Herstyler&#x27;s hair serum before and I was in love with it, but it eventually fiished. So I saw this with a few other add-on items and thought this was too good of a deal to pass. I absolutely love it, it makes my hair so healthy and soft. It&#x27;s amazing! I completely recommend this product and plus it ships in quickly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I actually went to the mall where these people were selling another product called Royale serum and they told me they were now using this Herstyler products now. For this kit they wanted $100!!!! I am a working mother of 5 and I don&#x27;t have $100 to just give for a hair product. Luckily it occured to me to look on Amazon.com for the product and there it is the whole set for $17.99!!!! I was so happy I ordered two! This product leaves the hair so healthy and fluffy! It is totally awesome! I recently put blonde highlights in my hair and we all know what kind of damage that does, but with the serum my highlights are just smoothed out when applying a small amount directly. My hair look healthier than it ever has!!! I LOVE THIS KIT and would recomend it to anyone who is feeling like their hair needs a kick of health and shine! And thank you Amazon.com for having such awesome deals!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Mommy with silky hair :)</li>
    <li> I like all these products,  but they&#x27;re no better than stuff I can buy at Walmart. The price for these at the mall is ridiculous ($50+) so I&#x27;m glad amazon has them reasonably priced. This is the first hair serum I&#x27;ve ever used and I like it, but it didn&#x27;t wow me. The smell is strong and I didn&#x27;t like it at first, but it smelled pretty good after it dried on my hair. I&#x27;m Polish with Caucasian naturally brunette hair, that is long and that I dye frequently. My current color is platinum blonde, so yes it is damaged. I occasionally style my hair and usually wash it every other day. I usually let it dry overnight, but sometimes I&#x27;ll blow dry it on a low setting. I apply 3-4 pumps of this in my hands because I have long hair (mid-back length) and then apply it throughout my towel-dried hair. The smell is better once it dries and settles into my hair,  but it&#x27;s not that great. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed the serum helps with is making my hair softer. The shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t work any better than stuff I could get at walmart. These bottles are pretty small and they don&#x27;t last me as long as normal sized shampoos and conditioners. I honestly like Suave Moroccan oil serum much better because it actually leaves my hair much shinier and softer, plus the smell is much better when settled into the hair. Plus,  it&#x27;s only around $4 at Walmart.  Overall,  I think the herstyler serum and the shampoo and conditioner are way overpriced for their results,  especially at the mall. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying these products again because I get much better results from Suave products for 1/3 of the price of these  even if herstyler is cheaper on amazon.</li>
