      <li>Its great.</li>
      <li>The product lasts forever and mine came with two travel size bars which are great to keep around.</li>
      <li>and I am sure they both work great, since Nano Cyclic did wonders for me.  </li>
      <li>Also this one is pretty close to it&#x27;s competitor on here and this is just as good at a fraction of the price!</li>
      <li>Very good product with a reasonable pricing.</li>
      <li>This has proven to be the MOST effective product for my granddaughter&#x27;s cystic acne.  </li>
      <li>This one seems to be the best so far.  </li>
      <li>This soap or cleanser is wonderful it makes my face feel soft.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>This is a really gentle cleansing bar on my skin, and I feel great after washing my face.</li>
      <li>one of the better ones - would re-purchase</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>Just ordered MORE...  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing more than soap.  </li>
      <li>Very happy to have tried this and plan on using it for a long time</li>
      <li>and she told me the soap was ok but nothing special.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t feel that it was as effective as a higher priced brand that I can&#x27;t afford at the moment.</li>
      <li>It is dying, and I feel the tightness in my skin, but my lotion takes care of that just fine.</li>
      <li>I am happy too because the supplier give out free smaller size  soap for every 60 gram size l purchased.</li>
      <li>nice price for silver soap really gentle</li>
      <li>Hence it is the most economically priced soap in the NANO soap family.</li>
      <li>my skin feels fabulous.</li>
      <li>Neither soap made any difference in fine lines, wrinkles or redness but did make a significant improvement in pore size.  </li>
      <li>Serves me right for believing the hype!</li>
      <li>In addition to the full size bar, I also received a travel size that I threw in my gym bag.</li>
      <li>Make sure to keep it out of as much water as you can.</li>
      <li>It smells good and tingles only the tiniest bit.</li>
      <li>I have also given bars of it to teens and young ladies that have been thrilled with it after their acne lessend.</li>
      <li>Saw Nano 153 and though it was a little too cheap in price to be good, but money doesn&#x27;t grow on trees</li>
      <li>He has been using this  NANO soap for a few years now and is happy with it.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>It lathers nicely but make sure after you use it that you let it dry out and store in a dry area.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, Nano 153 makes my skin feel clean and not dried out, also I don&#x27;t feel the need to use an astringent as with the Clinique products.</li>
      <li>It really helps my skin heal from breakouts and just overall better skin tone.</li>
      <li>The only difference I noticed is that this soap is a finely milled soap so more product is needed to foam and clean the face, however;  the 60g size of this is half the price of the 10g Cor trial size.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the best soaps I have ever purchased, my skin is normally dry in the winter and very itchy; however after using the produce my skin is thanking me every time no more dryness or itchiness</li>
      <li>I love this soap and will defiantly be a customer for a very long time!</li>
      <li>I have a granddaughter who has a real problem with scar tissue forming over pre-teen acne.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using the smaller sample that came free; I put the soap in a dish and keep it out of water getting on it, beyond use for washing.</li>
      <li>the soap was very drying for my skin and really did not help the acne</li>
      <li>I purchased this after falling in love with the much more expensive Cor silver soap.  </li>
      <li>Started using this product first of Nov. now is Feb first and behold her facial age spots are unrecognisable, ..</li>
      <li>you feel fresh all day long, even during the hot summer days like now.  </li>
      <li>highly recommended</li>
      <li>I was looking for something gentle to remove my makeup and clear my breakouts in one wash</li>
      <li>I used Nano Cyclic years ago to get rid of my acne, never tried Cor, however it seems pretty much the same ingredients as Nano Cyclic</li>
      <li>I normally purchase another brand of Silver Soap.</li>
      <li>This is my regular silver soap right now.</li>
      <li>I buy this product for my husband who has very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Nano 153 is good soap and does not dry my skin out, but is a softer-milled soap and won&#x27;t last as long as the Cor soap, so the savings may not really be there.</li>
      <li>Five years later: I had some skin problems again with acne and dryness, itchiness and didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money.  </li>
      <li>We had tried other special cleaners and facial products.  </li>
      <li>I was very skeptical that an inexpensive soap could be as good but was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>It has help clear up my acne and kept my face from getting dry.  </li>
      <li>One positive I will say is, despite the melting due to my not storing it properly, it did last a long time.</li>

<li> Get my face wet the then soap it up and leave it on my face as I wash the rest of me with different soap, and rinse.</li>
<li> These types of expensive soap bars can dissolve quickly if you use the in the shower daily.</li>
<li> I kept mine in the shower and that just made for a giant mess, it melted slightly on the bottom.</li>
<li> Acne and aging skin don&#x27;t go well together ... and hard to treat both at same time.</li>
<li> It is difficult to get a 12 year old to appreciate &amp;#34;saving the soap&amp;#34; though.  </li>
<li> After using this soap for a few weeks I asked if she saw a difference</li>
<li> No magical properties, no miraculous&lt;br</li>
<li> I usually lather it up and let it sit on my face for a minute before rinsing.</li>
<li> it actually helps heal her hands up instead of causing a bad reaction and rashes like other soaps do when you have eczema.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Cor nanosilver soap before and was looking for something not so expensive.</li>
<li> My daughter uses it when she washes her hands because she has eczema so bad and nothing else we&#x27;ve ever tried works for her hands.  </li>

    <li> I love this soap. Wish I knew about years ago!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best soaps I have ever purchased, my skin is normally dry in the winter and very itchy; however after using the produce my skin is thanking me every time no more dryness or itchiness my skin feels fabulous.</li>
    <li> found this while researching nano silver products. read some reviews and figured I would buy a bar for my wife. She uses some commercial brand soaps for her face only deemed to make age spot disappear. After using this soap for a few weeks I asked if she saw a difference and she told me the soap was ok but nothing special. Started using this product first of Nov. now is Feb first and behold her facial age spots are unrecognisable, ..Just ordered MORE...  highly recommended</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cor nanosilver soap before and was looking for something not so expensive. Nano 153 is good soap and does not dry my skin out, but is a softer-milled soap and won&#x27;t last as long as the Cor soap, so the savings may not really be there. Otherwise, Nano 153 makes my skin feel clean and not dried out, also I don&#x27;t feel the need to use an astringent as with the Clinique products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after falling in love with the much more expensive Cor silver soap.  I was very skeptical that an inexpensive soap could be as good but was very pleasantly surprised.  The only difference I noticed is that this soap is a finely milled soap so more product is needed to foam and clean the face, however;  the 60g size of this is half the price of the 10g Cor trial size.  Neither soap made any difference in fine lines, wrinkles or redness but did make a significant improvement in pore size.  My pores now look significantly smaller and clearer and I haven&#x27;t had any acne blemishes since I started using this soap.  I do want to mention that both soaps make my skin feel a bit &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; but I haven&#x27;t noticed any dryness or improvement in my oiliness.  I love this soap and will defiantly be a customer for a very long time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing more than soap.  No magical properties, no miraculous&lt;br /&gt;effect, just soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut it out with the hype!  Serves me right for believing the hype!</li>
    <li> Acne and aging skin don&#x27;t go well together ... and hard to treat both at same time. This is a BIG help. Helps reduce the bacteria on your skin but isn&#x27;t drying at all. Skin feels velvety when using this. These types of expensive soap bars can dissolve quickly if you use the in the shower daily. Make sure to keep it out of as much water as you can. I don&#x27;t leave the shower water run over it. Get my face wet the then soap it up and leave it on my face as I wash the rest of me with different soap, and rinse. I keep the soap on one of those soap pad thingy&#x27;s that keeps it out of standing water as it drains and drys. Lasts a long time this way. Also this one is pretty close to it&#x27;s competitor on here and this is just as good at a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> one of the better ones - would re-purchase</li>
    <li> nice price for silver soap really gentle</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my husband who has very sensitive skin. Any unsuitable product brieaks out his face. He has been using this  NANO soap for a few years now and is happy with it. He always bring it whenever he has to travel away from home. I am happy too because the supplier give out free smaller size  soap for every 60 gram size l purchased. Hence it is the most economically priced soap in the NANO soap family.</li>
    <li> It has help clear up my acne and kept my face from getting dry.  I Have cystic acne and nothing else has helped with stopping the break outs</li>
    <li> the soap was very drying for my skin and really did not help the acne</li>
    <li> Keeps the bacteria in underarms under control.</li>
    <li> I have a granddaughter who has a real problem with scar tissue forming over pre-teen acne.  We had tried other special cleaners and facial products.  This one seems to be the best so far.  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  It is difficult to get a 12 year old to appreciate &amp;#34;saving the soap&amp;#34; though.  Someone mentioned using a &amp;#34;sticky soap holder&amp;#34; on the shower wall and I tried that.  It works pretty well.  On my second order.  This has proven to be the MOST effective product for my granddaughter&#x27;s cystic acne.  She was without it for a couple of days and started to have problems almost immediately. As soon as she got back on it, her skin made improvement.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Not too drying or sticky either.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I was looking for something gentle to remove my makeup and clear my breakouts in one wash and this is it. I tried several of the more expensive brands prior to this and I&#x27;ve decided this is the best one for me. The product lasts forever and mine came with two travel size bars which are great to keep around. It smells good and tingles only the tiniest bit. I usually lather it up and let it sit on my face for a minute before rinsing. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This soap is working so well for my skin! Unlike some reviews, this is lasting a while. I&#x27;m still using the smaller sample that came free; I put the soap in a dish and keep it out of water getting on it, beyond use for washing. It is dying, and I feel the tightness in my skin, but my lotion takes care of that just fine.</li>
    <li> I use this soap every night on my face. It really helps my skin heal from breakouts and just overall better skin tone. My daughter uses it when she washes her hands because she has eczema so bad and nothing else we&#x27;ve ever tried works for her hands.  it actually helps heal her hands up instead of causing a bad reaction and rashes like other soaps do when you have eczema.</li>
    <li> This soap or cleanser is wonderful it makes my face feel soft.  I wound recomend this cleanser to anyone with skin issues. Its great.</li>
    <li> I used Nano Cyclic years ago to get rid of my acne, never tried Cor, however it seems pretty much the same ingredients as Nano Cyclic and I am sure they both work great, since Nano Cyclic did wonders for me.  Best part was not having to use it forever like Proactive.  Five years later: I had some skin problems again with acne and dryness, itchiness and didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money.  Saw Nano 153 and though it was a little too cheap in price to be good, but money doesn&#x27;t grow on trees and I decided to give it a go.  It works great!  For the price, I don&#x27;t think it can be beat.  Used it for about 1 week and the acne is almost all gone, skin doesn&#x27;t itch anymore and everything&#x27;s healing up real nicely.  That and you feel fresh all day long, even during the hot summer days like now.  Very happy to have tried this and plan on using it for a long time</li>
    <li> This is a really gentle cleansing bar on my skin, and I feel great after washing my face. I also see a big difference on my wife&#x27;s face since began to use it. Very good product with a reasonable pricing.</li>
    <li> This is my regular silver soap right now. I have also given bars of it to teens and young ladies that have been thrilled with it after their acne lessend. I am a fan!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in an attempt to save money. I normally purchase another brand of Silver Soap. I think that this helped my acne prone skin but I don&#x27;t feel that it was as effective as a higher priced brand that I can&#x27;t afford at the moment. It lathers nicely but make sure after you use it that you let it dry out and store in a dry area. I kept mine in the shower and that just made for a giant mess, it melted slightly on the bottom. One positive I will say is, despite the melting due to my not storing it properly, it did last a long time. In addition to the full size bar, I also received a travel size that I threw in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap sparely per directions; it should last a long time. I can not say that it has cleared up any of my skin aliments; but I assume time will tell.</li>
    <li> I limed the product you could tell the difference in your skin imediately</li>
