<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using the Callus Reducer for a couple of days, and it does seem very effective in reducing calluses. I should note that my real problem was a tiny shard of glass that stuck in the callus on the outside of my foot. Using this tool I was able to wear down the callus and ultimately removed the tiny bit of glass with another tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. It was painless and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Ilove this callus reducer it is the best I have ever used.  I use it all the time.  I am really glad you have this product.</li>
    <li> You will not believe how well this thing works!!  I bought two more for my daughters. I even suggested my favorite nail salon try them. Your feet will feel amazingly smooth. It does the job!</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and works very well! I&#x27;m so impressed with the results that I have recommended it to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> It really works.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I started getting blisters under calluses on my feet and they were making running very uncomfortable. I tried trimming with clippers but they just got worse. This devise works great and smoothing them down quickly and safely. I haven&#x27;t had issues with my feet since.</li>
    <li> Use in shower all the time</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a few weeks ago and must say that I&#x27;m very impressed! After about 10 minutes of using the callus remover on dry feet, my feet felt pretty darn close to how they do after a professional pedicure. I&#x27;ve never tried a scraper, but this callus remover worked better than several pumice stones and callus removers I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years. Love them.</li>
    <li> Does the job and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time, and still works great!</li>
    <li> Ive had horribly callused feet my whole life.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of products, lotions and pedicures. This is by far the BEST thing I&#x27;ve ever used.  My feet are softer than I can remember being. Amazing!</li>
    <li> THE BEST foot/heel callous file I have ever used, hands down (&amp; I have tried MANY). Easy &amp; fast. Gently &amp; highly effective. Sanding screen lasts for a LONG time. USE ON DRY FEET! Save some $$$ and buy a big pack of replacement screen (120 Drywall/Plaster sanding screen) at Home Depot for $12 &amp; cut to the right size yourself.</li>
    <li> I got this to remove two small stubborn calluses on my feet that I had not been able to remove for a year despite using all sorts of scrubbers and creams. After 2-3 uses i could see a very visible reduction in the calluses with this product and i would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how well this worked to reduce my stubborn calluses! My feels have never been smoother, and while I was skeptical at first about how this would work, now I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Sof&#x27; Feet is what I have been needing for several years.  I have tried other products and they didn&#x27;t make my feet any better.  I received mine today and have just completed using it and it really does work wonders.  It also doesn&#x27;t make your feet sore.  I put lotion on after doing both feet and can&#x27;t wait until in the morning to really see the results.  Thanks to whomever invented this instrument!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for removing dry calloused skin. After coming across a YouTube video I bought this product. It does a fantastic job! Throwing out my PediEgg, pumice and all other contraptions.....nothing is so simple and so effective as this.</li>
    <li> if you have calluses this really works</li>
    <li> This foot file is great. Be sure to use it on dry feet.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and  devices for callus removal and this simple  but very effective tool has been by far the best! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing to make feet smooth. I tried the Pedegg and that doesn&#x27;t come close to this product. Would highly recommend the product and the seller. Product arrived before I expected.</li>
    <li> I am 57 years old.  I get regular pedicures but have also tried every pumice stone, callus reducer, file, on the market!  This is the ONLY thing that works on my dried cracked feet!  Believe me, this is the best product ever!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I live in Arizona and am barefoot all the time. As a result, my heels became a horrible mess of cracking, flaking skin. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried to solve the problem by peeling the dead skin off by hand, or using a pair of toenail clippers to remove the callouses. This just made the problem worse. I&#x27;ve even used sandpaper, and amazingly that worked the best of anything I tried.    I knew a better tool/method was needed. Something that could rip down into the dead skin more effectively.     I then saw a video for this product online, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. After just a few minutes of use, it was obvious this tool was the solution. It easily removed my thick callouses within only 10-15 minutes per heel. The screen is quite hard and turns the callouses into a fine powder.      You do need to be a little careful, as once you get down to bare skin you can cut yourself....and I did....twice. Guess I was too enthusiastic, having finally found something that works. In addition, my heels are now fairly sore from the process, but that,too, is going away after just one day. I&#x27;m going to wait a week....let some healing occur, and then do the whole thing again to remove some of the areas I missed the first time around.     Great tool. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this little well made tool!  This is the ONLY thing that helps my dry cracked feet.  Believe me when I tell you I have tried everything!  You have to use this BEFORE the shower do not use on wet skin or after the shower....it will not work and you will ruin the screen.  Then after the shower put lotion on and your socks and you will have smooth heels in less than a week.  Then it is just once or twice a week for maintenance.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me well</li>
    <li> This product is the most effective thing I have ever tried... but all it is is something called \\&quot;Drywall sanding screen\\&quot; and a pretty handle. You can buy it at any hardware store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, but when it became unavailable in my area I went to Amazon to purchase it.  I bought several for my friends and family!  It gently and effectively removes dry calluses on my heels without any pain at all!</li>
    <li> I really love it and it does what other reviewers said. It works great on dry feet.</li>
    <li> works really good.better than anything i tried.I just received this last week.So far works well.</li>
    <li> i have lots of skin on my heels and every single other product i have tried(pedi egg etc) hurts EXCEPT this one. So glad that i stumbled across this by reading other ppls reviews.  You use this on dry feet then just use lotion after and you wont even feel it- it doesnt cut into your skin like the razor sharp other products because the the material is like a stringed sand paper.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  I like that you can use it on dry skin and it works!  I will definitely be buying the refills in the future!  :)</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the results however it does take a lot of work</li>
    <li> Worked great! Took a few days to get the calluses completely gone but it works!</li>
    <li> I had seen a youtube video where a woman uses drywall screening to get rid of calluses and dry skin on her feet.  I liked the idea, since it would be cheaper then the ped-egg type devices that wear out.  I was shopping for the drywall screens to give it a try and this came up in the other items list on the page, and this was just the perfect thing.  Holds the screens, so you dont have too.  Gives you a handle to work with, and will hold any type of screen or sanding material......I love this thing, my feet have never been so smooth, thanks</li>
    <li> This is much better than the ped egg. The screen lets you rub in any direction and seems less likely to cut skin if you rub too long, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the filed area all choppy and serrated like the ped egg does. The only complaint I have is that the skin you shave off just flakes into the air and onto the floor and gets stuck in the screen, so you have to tap it on something to clean it out after a few rubs. The screens seem to file themselves down rather fast (I noticed significant wear on my first screen after my first use) but luckily they can be replaced.  On a side note, the overall design is very amateurish and low tech. The handle also feels like it&#x27;ll be the first part to break and I&#x27;m always worrying that I&#x27;m pressing too hard because it feels like it&#x27;s about to snap. Still, I&#x27;m very satisfied overall with this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my pedicurist to help me with my callused feet.  It works great, I use it in the shower or before I put my shoes on.  Just be careful to not push too hard, take it slow and it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  My daughter is going away for college in the fall and I had to get her one - I was afraid she&#x27;d take mine with her and I wouldn&#x27;t discover it was missing until she was gone!  Get a supply of the refill screens or make your own and don&#x27;t over-do it.  Always use on dry feet.  Sand, tap out the dry skin from the skin.  Hop into the shower.  Apply lotion.  You&#x27;ll have baby soft feet!</li>
    <li> After visiting several Podiatrists, without any relief for a very painful callus, I tried this product.  Now, after 6 months, I am pain free.  2-3 minutes every morning before bathing keeps the callus under control.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Using it, morning and night, along with a foot cream, have eliminated my need to have surgery for removal of deep calluses.</li>
    <li> I needed something more gentle than a callus shaver for certain parts of my feet that dont&#x27; have thick build up. This works great on the  scaly, flakey,  skin verse the really hard callous that needs a razor/shaver (blade). I use it  before I shower and it works a treat. Smooth feet are the norm for me now.</li>
    <li> This worked awesome. The screens went dull after a while but that&#x27;s to be expected.  Will definitely order again</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LIKES IT. SHE HAS BOUGHT ALL TYPES OF CALLIUS REMOVING TOOLS AND THIS ONE WORKS VERY GOOD</li>
    <li> So effective and super easy to use.</li>
    <li> ***OOPS! I left this review on the REPLACEMENT SCREENS rather than the tool so I am copying and re-posting here, in the correct place.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t you just HATE the time you spend being INEFFECTIVE!!!??? :-( :-( :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that had been my experience when searching for, buying and using EVERY other pedicure tool available ...PRIOR to this little beauty! I have had manual, motorized, egg-shaped &amp; devices akin to WOODWORKING planers (lol) etc. but all they were was a waste of my time and effort compared to this little pedicure tool. NO MORE!!! Thanks to the beauty of YouTube browsing, I came across a woman who proclaimed this was THE BEST pedicure tool she had EVER used and she was 100% correct!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It perfectly, evenly and WITHOUT DAMAGE renders not-so-perfect, ill-treated doggies (feet) into soft, smooth, creamy fetish-worthy tootsies! :-)&lt;br /&gt;If you EVER do your pedicures at home you MUST, MUST, MUST replace every other outdated, hazardous-to-health tool in your collection and upgrade to the Sof Feet Callus Reducer---the LAST pedicure tool you will EVER buy!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband &amp; it works great. Better than any other one he&#x27;s tried before. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it when I acually used it at first.&lt;br /&gt;but my feet stays smooth longer than any other product I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;and I like the fact the I can use it anywhere in the house because my feet don&#x27;t have to be wet.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend !!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and watching a YouTube video, I bought it.  It works well.  It &amp;#34;reduces&amp;#34; the callus to smooth skin.  I didn&#x27;t buy replacement pads as I wanted to try it first.  It&#x27;s easy to use and quickly &amp;#34;does the job.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never even written an online review for a product before, but I&#x27;m SO impressed with this little thing. It works much better and faster at removing dead and callused skin from my heels than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I usually end up giving up and heading to the spa to shell out $30+ bucks for a professional to do it, but with this, I may never pay for another pedicure. I love you Sof Feet!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and absolutely love it! My mom sent it to me in Seoul last year, but I lost it when traveling in Thailand and Cambodia so had to get another one after that trip!! I have had a stubborn callus for years that professional pedicures couldn&#x27;t get rid of. After only a week my callus has vanished! I use this product every month before I go to bed. Not only does it make your feet look amazing, but they feel amazing too! It&#x27;s easy to use and you should use it dry.  You don&#x27;t need to get it wet.</li>
    <li> Was considerably worn after one use.</li>
    <li> This works better for me than the battery-operated files.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was using the ped egg but no more. In my opinion this works much better. I had to be careful when using the ped egg to make sure I didn&#x27;t remove too much and make my heels sore. With the sof feet calllus reducer I have more control. It is much kinder to my feet. To save shipping I went ahead and ordered the replacement screens. This is now my go to until if and when something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products to deal with my rough feet but this is by far the very best!</li>
    <li> While surfing the internet I ran across a youtube video of some woman reviewing this product.  In her video she said it was the best gizmo she ever tried to get rid of rough skin off the feet. I have tried everything myself.  I have tried various expensive creams, pumice stones and the egg you can buy in any drugstore.  I put this on my amazon wishlist and finally ordered it when I had enough items in my cart to qualify for free shipping.  It really does the job but I&#x27;m not telling my hubby and daughter.  They have the same problem with the dry cracked feet and I don&#x27;t want them using my tool.  Maybe I will order one for their own personal use.  Had I known this product was effective I would have ordered more replacement screens.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to get rid of thick callouses and dead skin on my feet and toes.  The little device is by far the best of them all.  It&#x27;s so simple, yet really works.  You can smooth down any bumps or imperfections until they are hardly noticeable.  I highly recommend this tool -- it works.</li>
    <li> I had a huge callus on my heel.  Ordered this because of the reviews and because it was cheap.  It took the callus right off.  I didn&#x27;t go all the way because some of the reviews about cutting oneself worried me.  I took about 90% of it off in 15 minutes.  I&#x27;ll do a little more later but it&#x27;s a huge difference already, I notice when I walk, it&#x27;s much nicer.  Great product!</li>
    <li> My heals were so dry and cracked that they would bleed a little and wearing sandels didnt help matters much.  Tried some of the best foot lotion but that did really nothing.  Received the sof feet callus reducer in the mail and that night, my heals were 1000% better and the callus/cracked heals are pretty much gone.  Have used it 3x in the past 5 days and I no longer have chapped, cracked, callus heals.  I should have bought one of these years ago because my heals have been bad for some time.</li>
    <li> I have tried a bunch of different brands and types and this one really does work the best for dry feet</li>
    <li> I have had cracked, dry heels forever and have tried many different callus removers.  Before this, the best I had found was a callus razor but you have to be very careful.  You can easily cut yourself if you get over zealous with a callus razor.  This is so much better!  The reviews that said it doesn&#x27;t work; bet they didn&#x27;t work at it very hard.  After working on my calluses with this over a couple of days, the calluses are gone.  It works best dry.  Since it is summer, I&#x27;ve been working on my callused feet outside.  When it gets cold, I will use this in the shower, before I turn the water on, so the dry skin &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t get all over the place.  You do have to get the replacement screens but I had to get replacement blades for the callus razor too. Highly recommended!! This thing is great!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Buy the refills at HomeDepot.</li>
    <li> This little tool is amazing!! I&#x27;ve always had extremely callused heels. So much that they would crack and bleed. I love sandals so it&#x27;s kind of embarrassing. I just received this today and I&#x27;m extremely impressed! My heels are smoother than the last time I had a pedicure. They even charged me extra because my heels were so callused! Now I can go get that pedicure without being embarrassed about my feet :)</li>
    <li> Works great on removing stubborn calluses on your feet and is easy to clean. I definitely recommend this over the &amp;#34;Ped-Egg&amp;#34;. The callus remover part is also replaceable.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it, you probably don&#x27;t, either. I am telling you with 100% honesty - it is amazing how well this thing works!!!  I have had a terrible time with dry, cracked heels for the past 5 years and with less than 10 minutes work my feet are baby soft!  All I did was rub that thing back and forth a bunch of times and then put on some Eucerin foot cream and it&#x27;s like I have new feet.  It seems unbelievable, but you can believe it.</li>
    <li> This product works really good and better than a pumice stick but I would recommend getting the refill pack when you buy it because this one does not last long especially if you need to remove heavy callouses.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! It&#x27;s a little delicate, so be careful. The first one I bought fell from my nightstand to the hardwood floor and broke (after ONE use!!). I was mad, yes indeed I was. But this tool was so awesome that I bought another one. It&#x27;s worth it! I bought one for my sister too...It files away and smoothes those crusty dogs like no other.  Don&#x27;t over do it though. You don&#x27;t want to file too much and hurt yourself! And don&#x27;t even worry about purchasing replacement screens. Go to Walmart and get the drywall sander stuff. When you go, you will see which one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;Use at night, on dry feet (over a garbage can). Wash your feet, pat dry, and apply a cream with 40% cream and Vicks vaporub. Cover with socks. Use the callus reducer once a week. Apply the cream/vicks every night. You will thank me later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re welcome. ;-)</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Quick Solution for Tough Calluses&lt;br /&gt;*Easy&lt;br /&gt;*Effective&lt;br /&gt;*Cheap&lt;br /&gt;*Sturdy and great handle/design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Add On Item so you need to have $25 in your cart to ship it&lt;br /&gt;-Mesh strip might need to be replaced after a couple uses depending on how much skin/callus you are removing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got some severe calluses on the bottom of my feet from running. The area right below the toes, i got two painful calluses on both of  them. I tried everything for salacyclic callus patches from CVS to solutions and even pumices stones. I even ended up paying a lot of money for special gel inserts that helped a little but not by much. The patches did help a little but my calluses were thick on each foot. Plus it was such a pain because I would have to keep them on all day. The pumice stone really hurt when i used it so i had to stop and it didnt do much. So I decided to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first when i saw this online i thought this was a cheese grater type of device and to be honest it kind of is. So i purchased with prime and ordered a couple other things i needed on Amazon since this is an Amazon Add-On item (you need $25 in your cart to ship it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out and literally within 2 minutes my callus was significantly smaller. I was really surprised, it worked amazingly and so quickly! The best part is that it didnt hurt, rather it was just a soft type of rubbing feeling. Keep in mind my calluses were thick and very painful so to see that this device didnt hurt my feet as I was using them was a huge relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, after a certain amount of rubbing down the callus, i would recommend washing it (the black mess) so the excess skin (i know gross) gets off the mesh. I washed it after the black turned to white haha or each foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically after 2 months of trying to find a solution for my painful calluses that wouldn&#x27;t go away and kept coming back, this device helped remove them within 5 minutes all for $8.25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can finally saw that after 2 months i can walk pain free and its almost a feeling I forgot. I would defniitely recommend this to all the people out there that struggle with painful calluses on the bottom of their feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall one of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon! A+++thin 5 minutes all for $8.25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can finally saw that after 2 months i can walk pain free and its almost a feeling I forgot. I would defniitely recommend this to all the people out there that struggle with painful calluses on the bottom of their feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall one of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon! A+++</li>
    <li> I saw a video for this product on YouTube, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. After just a few minutes of use, it was obvious this tool was the solution. It easily removed my callouses within only 5-7 minutes per heel.  The screen is quite hard and turns the callouses into a fine powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I cleaned and dried my feet and rubbed Soul Food Foot Cream on them. My feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> It kind of removes calluses, but doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product. I haven&#x27;t had a lot  of time to use it. Mine broke in a few days. I think it it was a flawed item. The company was terrific to deal with and replaced it immediately. And were very kind to deal with. I have not used my new one, yet I believe it will be fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this last year and invited a few of my friends to do the same.  Overall I really like the effectiveness of the screens on this product in removing calluses.  Although it seems the quality of the screw top on the holder is poor.  I have used it all this time.  I tried to replace the screen, the screw got stuck, and nothing, and I mean nothing could get it out.  I tried WD40,small pliers, nothing.  Manufacturer should look into the design and perhaps make the insert more easy to remove.  Finally I got it to move, and the top of the screw popped off and left the insert in the Lucite holder.  Holder not made too well.  So now I have replacement screens and nothing to put it on. I will try to call the company I bought it off for a replacement.  The screens are cumbersome to use without the holder.  They need to work together.  Good product, holder poor quality, for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDDATE 2012:  The company was very gracious and prompt in their response and in rectifying the problem.  Kudos to them!  They reissued another product very quickly with no problem, and additional screens free of charge..  That&#x27;s great customer service!  Very good company to do business with!  I will be a repeat customer.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> What an outstanding product!  Simply amazing!  It will leave your heels so, so soft and smooth.  You must try it!  Must!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many different products to give my feet that soft look, and none have performed anywhere close to this product. I never feel like it&#x27;s rubbing my skin raw, just sloughing off calluses. Make sure you buy replacement screens though, they full rather quickly. Best product for soft feet around!</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love it. I believe anybody needs to have one of these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not changing my life or anything. I guess if you&#x27;d never tried a good file before you might be blown away by it. It&#x27;s kind of like any other diamond file you can buy in terms of coarseness. Although I&#x27;m not sure it would last as long as a diamond file will. Seems like it will dull like an emory board.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is like waffle cut sandpaper, and as rough as a strong nail file.</li>
    <li> This product works as described. Feels good to use it, too. Found it via a YouTube video on grooming. Great!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! My feet have never looked or felt better. I wear flip flops everyday and you could never tell with this cream. Great product.</li>
    <li> The Sof Feet Callus Remover requires a bit of effort since it isn&#x27;t motorized, but I bought and like the product because I know it won&#x27;t break on me (no motors, it is robustly built) , and the callus removing strips are easy to replace at my local hardware store. It definitely works and is pretty gentle on the feet at the same time.</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread. Easily removes rough, calloused edges. After going barefoot most of my life, this really helps with the icky feet. Sent another one to a friend with same problem. Great product.</li>
    <li> This does a pretty good job, I have super cracked and dry feet so maybe I just need a tougher product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone who grows calluses as fast as my feet can, esp the right one. It seems like there is a 5 mm layer every day that needs to be pulled off. This is so strange because I can seldom get up due to health reasons. It&#x27;s worse on the right foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all the natural and purchased products, foot soaks, scrubbing scrubbing and more scrubbing, then filing, and even peeling off thick layers of this rubbery callus. When I saw this product and its reviews, well I jumped for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate!!! I got mine today, and as I rubbed the screen against my calluses, it gently turned the rubbery layers into a fine, fine FINE white powder, sort of like the softest of powdered sugar -- no exaggeration! I even used it on both big toes even though they aren&#x27;t too bad of a problem. Afterwards, I soaked my feet in a diluted soapy basin, then dried them off. I applied the Sof&#x27;Feet Cream to both feet, as well. It only takes a tiny bit (size of a pinto bean?) for each foot and the cream covers the entire foot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed my husband the results, and he is just amazed. I am so happy happy :D :D :D!!!! Thank you Sof&#x27; Feet!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was perfect, no heavy scraping and so easy to use</li>
    <li> It works wonders in rough calluses, no more rough skin, no more cracked heels. It&#x27;s worth its value in gold!</li>
    <li> This item is a joke. The screen that comes with the tool to reduce feet calluses is a flexible flemsy piece of material. When you scrape your feet with it nothing happens, it just feels akward.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used weekly and noted my foot is alot smother. I will buy refills. thank you.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s designed to do...but...the handle of this couldn&#x27;t be more uncomfortable if it tried to be. It needs reshaping to fit a woman&#x27;s hand...as it is now it would fit a pro basketball players hand. I can not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I saw a youtube video for these when i got frustrated with my pumice stone not quite doing the job for my feet... this little tool, works way better and more quickly.  Every women should own one.&lt;br /&gt;(also it was shipped on time perfectly - thanks!)</li>
    <li> Very nice and works great sturdy would buy again used it first day I received it . I would say buy</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I purchased this item and it does what it says! It works great!</li>
    <li> Used when feet are dry which is handy.</li>
    <li> the best  way to describe this is... wow.. omg it works great. I saw a video on youtube.... a lady was recommending it... so I found it on amazon and I have to tell  you, it works great on your feet but they have to be dry.  you will have soft feet in a few second.  I have bought to many other things in the past and I even pay to get callus removed at the beauty salon but nothing works like this item.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing a review on YouTube.  I&#x27;m thinking this person had to of gotten paid for the positive review because my experience was very disappointing.  I used as instructed and barely saw a difference under all the messy white powder-like flakes that were left behind.  I&#x27;m thinking if I wanted to spend days using this product, I&#x27;d probably get results closer to that of a pumice stone, but that&#x27;s so not happening!  I&#x27;ve even used the reducer immediately prior to using a pumice stone in the shower, and the pumice stone removes so much more dead skin - leaving me wondering if the reducer did anything at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
    <li> This really works. I have tried just about everything and this works. I bought this with the sole food lotion.</li>
    <li> This product really does the job. I didn&#x27;t have many expectations so I was happily surprised. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It works better than any other rasp or even the battery powered smoothest. Good old drywall Sanders!</li>
    <li> love this product, works great, easy to use and clean, I would recommend it to anyone with rough feet, good buy.</li>
    <li> This works great.  What a clever invention!  It is probably the best way to reduce calluses, and it is very easy to use, too.</li>
    <li> Never again will I use a foot razor again. This is it and works better than any product I&#x27;ve used it the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to deal with the large callus I have on my right foot.  Finally, I found something that really works.  It is used on dry feet, not wet, and it is very effective in gently removing dead skin.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When used on dry feet followed by a foot soak, a slathering of old fashioned Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline) and a pair of cotton or wool socks overnight, you&#x27;ll wake up to the smoothest feet you&#x27;ve has since childhood. Rather than purchasing the refills I purchased Fine-Grit and Medium-Grit Drywall Sanding screens and cut them the same size of the one that came with the callus reducer.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to receiving this and believed it would take care of my calluses. No. I didn&#x27;t find it to be of anything that special. If you were suggested this device by a you tube video, I&#x27;m wondering if that woman owns this company! I also ordered drywall paper and it isn&#x27;t a magic solution either. I think foot soaking works better than any devices one can buy. It&#x27;s just that most of us don&#x27;t have the time to soak as often as we should to soften the calluses. I was hopeful because I never had calluses until a few years ago, but no. This is as good as any pumice or device on the market though. It helps slightly I believe, but no outstanding difference after using this, so I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had i knew the minor, minor results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome gadget only 4 stars because it could have included a few refills, but over all very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every type of file out there (including a dremel!), and this has worked the best for me.  I use it before and after I apply Be Natural Callus Eliminator that I bought at Sally&#x27;s, apply lotion, then wear gel-heeled socks (which I also got at Sally&#x27;s), and my feet/heels have never been softer.  I need to do it once or twice a week in the winter to keep up results, but you may need to do it more often at first if your heels are really bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the ped egg for the last three years and always thought that it was the best thing out there, until I got the Sof feet Callus Reducer. This thing is amazing, my feet are done in half the time and smoother than they&#x27;ve ever been. Even those areas where I had to scrub and scrub and scrub are now smoothed down in minutes. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife was bothered by her rough feeling feet. Someone recommended this product to her. Since using the callus reducer she is very happy with the softness of her feet.</li>
    <li> I have a painful callus under my big toe that I even had removed by a doctor and it came right back!  No need to try that again, so I went on Amazon&#x27;s website to check products, found this and checked out the reviews for this product.  The video posted by one of the users sold me.  I have only used it a few times so far, but I feel I am getting good results - even compared with the doctor&#x27;s knife.  Of course, I&#x27;m using it all over on the underside of my feet.</li>
    <li> I had the choice of buying blade replacements for my ped egg or find a different callus remover.  I chose to try a different callus reducer with better reviews.  In my opinion the ped egg works waaaaaaay better.  No competition.  So if you are debating like I did, just get the replacements, don&#x27;t waste your time with this.</li>
    <li> This tool is amazing. I have had it for at least five years, and it is still intact. It is shaped so that you can exfoliate with ease.&lt;br /&gt;The replaceable screens are the secret:  they can tackle the roughest skin. The screens are replaceable, which means that when one screen wears down (for me, the screens last a few weeks, as I do not use the tool every day) it can be replaced and you have a brand new tool. The screens are very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, the tool with screen is waterproof. I do have some rust from not leaving it to dry properly after use, but I&#x27;ve used it in the shower as well as with dry feet. Use any cream or scrub you&#x27;d like. It isn&#x27;t necessary but if you do use something of that sort, just rinse the screen section thoroughly afterward.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent and well-kept secret.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  For best results, use it on the calus dry. Daily or even weekly use will keep all caluses in check especially if you use a good moisturizer afterwards.  My original Sof Feet Callus Reducer cracked in half after 5 years of daily use and I could not find a beauty supply store that carried them anymore. Replacement screens are inexpensive so its smart to buy a few more than you need to get the free shipping.</li>
    <li> Best callus remover I&#x27;ve ever tried. And you can purchase drywall sanding screens for replacement at a great price.</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;ve been on a mission to find the perfect callous reducer for my cracked and bleeding heels. I have to laugh - I&#x27;ve bought way too many of these things in the last 6 months. But here&#x27;s the final say.  Although I love the electric rolling callus removers, the replacement rolls cost too much and have to be replaced too often. The big callous grater works if you have very heavy callouses like I did. But once you rasp them down AND keep up on your pedi care  you don&#x27;t need the grater any longer. (You have to stay on top of callous reducing once you have them or they come right back and you have to start over again -sigh) This reducer gets my vote as the best of the bunch. The screens last a long time, they&#x27;re very effective and replacements are inexpensive. Buy a packet of the extra replacement screens right away when you order this. Then keep it near the bathtub to quickly buff callouses before and after a bath or shower. My heels are in better shape than they&#x27;ve ever been. I&#x27;ve also bought this for my daughter. Luckily, she learned from my purchases and doesn&#x27;t now have a drawer full of these things.</li>
    <li> I have bad cracked heals and callous on the balls of my feet.  The first usage in the shower made my feet smooth and soft again!</li>
    <li> This is my second Sof feet and I am happy with the results.  Keeps me from having to have my feet shaved when I get pedicures.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Does the job very well, a winner.</li>
    <li> This product is quite sturdy and works really well at removing calluses.  Should be used with a foot cream after for complete care.</li>
    <li> Best foot file and callous reducer on the market and I&#x27;ve had them all. From Amope to the pedi-spin. Glad I came across this. Great price too. The screens last a long time and they are inexpensive. Great product just in time for summer.</li>
    <li> I had the PegEgg and it doesn&#x27;t compare to how smooth my feet were after using the Sof Feet Callus Reducer. I enjoy being barefoot no matter what time of year it is, so I&#x27;ve developed a few calluses along the way. This keeps my feet baby soft and I&#x27;ll be taking it with me to the nail salon, for use during my biweekly pedicures. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> It holds the &amp;#34;drywall sandpaper&amp;#34; that has been cut up that one could easily buy at Home Depot and cut themselves. It holds the product well but it is so abrasive and had to be thrown away.</li>
    <li> I have a severe callous on my right heel and this is the only thing that has ever kept it pain free - in a matter of seconds my heel is smooth again with no pain at all -I&#x27;ve had to go to the podiatrist many times for it in the past and used expensive medically prescribed creams and wrapprd my foot all night and now I don&#x27;t have to do any of that and I don&#x27;t limp!!</li>
    <li> It takes care of the callus build up i get toes and heels very quickly.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product like this for a long time. I prefer to go barefoot during the summer and I don&#x27;t want to get a pedicure. Needless to say I have always had calluses and nothing ever seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a simple design and works so much better then I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitant because you don&#x27;t believe anything could work this well.. give it a try.. you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> My feet are gross; this helps.  It cleans easy, and you&#x27;d be amazed how much dead skin comes off of your feet and heels when you go at it with this thing.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit, and really gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best callous remover I&#x27;ve ever used ~ and much safer than razor blades! It lasts a long time before needing to change the screen! I just can&#x27;t get over the fact that I&#x27;ve missed this product for so long!</li>
    <li> This worked well on my calluses and was easy to clean. I also like the container it comes in for storage under the sink. I think for the price it is good quality and effective.</li>
    <li> All it did was smooth mine out. I guess it&#x27;s worth it for that much. Probably better to get something a little harsher and using this as a finisher/buffer...</li>
    <li> This is a great product and works very well.  It cleans up nicely after use!  I have recommended it to several.</li>
    <li> Always looking for a product to help with dry heels? Pumice stones, lotions, or other things? I don&#x27;t like using razors or shavers to remove dead skin. I usually use a pumice stone and lotion. It&#x27;s a never ending battle. I read the previous reviews on this product and was pretty impressed. My expectations were high for when the callus remover arrived. I was not disappointed. I spent a few minutes with the device and was so pleased with the results. A little bit of &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; back and forth on each foot and my heels were so smooth as if I just left the salon from a great pedicure. It&#x27;s been a few days since I used it and I did a couple of seconds (yes, seconds) on each foot today for a touch up. I&#x27;m so happy with it! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works better than other callus removers that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Works well with ProLinc Callus Eliminator.</li>
    <li> This is the best pedicure tool ever.  It works great, and keeps my feet soft for a long time.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best scraper I&#x27;ve used.  it&#x27;s very sturdy and easy to use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works better than anything I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for corns and dry skin on the foot, works very well for removal&lt;br /&gt;of dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a pedi egg for years, and always hated how long it took.  I was looking for something more like what my pedicurist uses.  This is a great tool, I spend 5 minutes instead of 20 getting the same amount of dead skin off.</li>
    <li> Incredible cream recommended!</li>
    <li> Did not get an extra pad as some reviewers stated but it does the job and those dry heels!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday... I love it!</li>
    <li> My feet definitely smell a lot less since being consistent about removing the dead skin, and this sucker works fast! Easy does it though... it&#x27;s easy to take off too much at once and leave your skin a bit raw. But this things works, and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
    <li> Really smoothes out calluses.</li>
    <li> Buy another foot dead skin remover! This one is worthless! I bought a better one at Walmart! This didn&#x27;t take off dead skin at all, got clogged first swipe!</li>
    <li> Best scrubber for my runners feet that I&#x27;ve ever used. Just a tip: I think it works best when my feet are dry.</li>
    <li> Simple product, much like the pumice it didn&#x27;t do much. I bought it because it had a lot of great reviews, but that was a mistake.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get all of the positive reviews. This is a BASIC sanding type callous remover. Not spectacular!  Now, if you want a spectacular callous remover, check out the electric Bario. I got it from amazon, too. Love it so much that I&#x27;ve given it as gifts. Check IT out!</li>
    <li> This is a must have! Love it!</li>
    <li> I found a video on you-tube whereby product was highly recommended.  After use, I can honestly say that my feet have never been softer.  Purchased one for a friend too and she couldn&#x27;t be happier either.  We will be sharing info on this product!  It&#x27;s is the best for removing the dry skin and so easy!</li>
    <li> This tool is awesome. Works better than anything I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> Best foot file ever leaves feet nice and soft</li>
    <li> Does the job without the pain!</li>
    <li> Works wonderful ! My feet never looked so good!</li>
    <li> This, by far, is the best foot product EVER!!! I cannot speak highly enough about this thing. It is amazing. As other reviewers have noted, the dead skin flakes just fall off. No soaking necessary, just start rubbing on the needed areas and in no time the dry flaky skin is gone. Be careful, this thing will cause friction burns so slow down when going over the more sensitive parts of your foot. L.O.V.E. I.T.!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and years. Our state codes require a disposable material, this tool uses an economical screen and the holder can be sanitized in barbicide. Professionally, contact the seller for stainless nuts and tools without printing (comes off in the sanitizer). The tool works both wet and dry and is very effective with callus softening treatments.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin and hated summer because of dried, cracked feet.  Once I was introduced to this product, I love wearing sandals all summer.  It is easy, quick to use and makes a huge difference.  I have the best results when I follow up with their foot cream.  Love this product!  [[ASIN:B0006NXOZY Sof&#x27;Feet Softening Cream, 8 oz]]</li>
    <li> I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE HOW EASILY AND WELL THIS PRODUCT WORKS.  I HAD A VERY PAINFUL CALLOUS ON MY FOOT AROUND THE SMALL TOE AREA AND WHEN I USED THIS ON IT IT REALLY HELPED MAKE THE CALLUS SMALLER AND RELIEVED THE PAIN.  THANKS &amp; KUDOS TO WHOEVER CAME UP WITH CREATING THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Works wonderful!  My feet are so nice now!</li>
    <li> Would give it 10 stars if I could.  This is the best callous remover I have ever tried - and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Only takes a few minutes each day and my feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind.  And I go barefoot all the time.  I use O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s foot cream afterwards, and my feet feel great!  Definitely worth it.  And - the screen lasts a really long time.  I&#x27;ve been using mine daily for over a month, and I&#x27;m still on the original screen it came with.</li>
    <li> Great item. I would re-order it again</li>
    <li> I LOVE my high heels and constantly wear them throughout my 12 hour days.  This unfortunately causes quite a few calluses which I usually have removed with regular pedicures.  I purchased this in the hopes that it would keep my feet soft in between pedis and I can say that it has pretty much removed the need for them. The last time I went the girl couldnt find any! We were both amazed! LOL! I would do my own pedicures at home with this tool if I wasn&#x27;t so bad at applying nail polish!</li>
    <li> This works fantastic helping me cope with my hard diabetes feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because the smaller plastic piece will break if you crank the screw too tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you got a vacuum close by of you got alot of large hard feet skin.... you will turn your carpet into skin land. I use a newspaper now so i do not get the scowls from the wife.</li>
    <li> Not working, bad quality.</li>
    <li> Do you have thick cracking heels?  does your husband have hooves?  this is for you.  approved by my podiatrist, it files down even man-hooves.  my husband had nasty cracking heels.  he would clip them with  scissors causing a bloody mess.  i got him one of these, he files the heels every night before bed ( over a trash can unless you want foot dust everywhere-ick!)  now he had bay soft feet!  i&#x27;d pay twice the amount for it now knowing what it can do and it would still be a good deal</li>
    <li> This is the best working callous remover I have ever used. I have very dry skin and this has provided terrific relief to my dry and calloused heels.</li>
    <li> Love it. Simple, easy to use, straightforward product for removing calluses. Works well and seems like a sturdy little product.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!  I have used a name brand callus file for years and I have to say that this thing blows that away!  I like that you use it on dry feet right before you get into the shower.  I always hated trying to file in the shower.  I have only used it twice and my feet look better than they ever have!</li>
    <li> I saw a review on youtube that touted this as THE BEST.  I&#x27;m so glad I went ahead and bought this.  It works better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these. However, if you need refills just go buy yourself a package of drywall sandpaper at the hardware store, (that&#x27;s all it is anyway), and cut them across the short way and they will be the perfect size. You should be able to get 4-5 refills out of one sheet. This is the most effective and sanitary way I have found to reduce callous build up.</li>
    <li> I recieved it Today Nov 1st and got down to business with it and Im so freaking amazed at how much softer the bottom, sides and heel of my feet are. I highly reccommend. giving this a try!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for months and it just didn&#x27;t work well.  Then I used my husbands pedi egg and it made a world of difference.  I tossed it out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Will never use another product after using this callus reducer. I have bought several as gifts and those who receifed it are very happy with them also.  Very happy with transactions and service.</li>
    <li> Sof Feet Callus Reducer did the job. I found this product through an online YouTube product endorsement clip and was intrigued. I had tried many products in the past but this product is easy to use, easy to clean, and does not cause injury.  I highly recommend it to those who want &#x27;salon smooth&#x27; feet for summertime.</li>
    <li> It was GREAT! I bought it for my girlfriend and it definitely got the job done. This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever done for an online product so you know that it was something special. I told my girlfriend that she had &amp;#34;Hard, Hobbity feet&amp;#34; all the time (jokingly of course ;) ) and that she needed to take better care of her feet. So for her 21st birthday I bought her the Sof Feet Callus Reducer and I performed her own little pedicure and foot massage for her.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This was a gift for a friend.  Arrived on time and my friend loves it.</li>
    <li> I have rough feet.  They drive me crazy because my skin grabs my sheets they are so rough.  I have tried a lot of products this product takes off the main callus on my feet.  I purchased more of the screens but have found the screen lasts and you can reverse it and it is like a new screen.  But I will use all of the screens over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then purchased a Emjoi Buffer and I use this after the Sof Feet Callus Reducer.  This really removes more dry skin.  I finish with the PedEgg black file to really smooth my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do this often to keep my feet soft and smooth.  So yes the Sof Feet Callus reducer really works expecially on two really bad calluses I have on the ball of my foot.</li>
    <li> I was quick to buy this callus reducer after reading several reviews on the web about it.  It does not disappoint!  I quickly and effectively got rid of the ugliness that was taking up residence on my heels in minutes!  It was painless and my heels are now soft &amp; smooth!  This is definitely my new go-to!</li>
    <li> I love this callus reducer.  I have tried other products and even an electric device.  This is working great so far.  My feet aren&#x27;t that bad, but they tend to get dry and then I will pick at the dry skin.  This makes the heels feel really soft.  I use it before bed and then put lotion on my feet.  For the price, try it and if it doesn&#x27;t work for you then send it back.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have bought from Amazon so far. I wish all products would do exactly what they promise, just like this wonderful tool that took care of my 30 year - old feet that has prior to now, never seen a callous remover.&lt;br /&gt;My heels started developing cracked lines,and I have never felt more ashamed of them especially because my husband has very smooth feet. In summary, this product is AWESOME as my feet are as soft as can be. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Now this really works, it is the best product I have bought that really works on feet.  Suggested was the sole feet cream, which I bought and it did not work it all, vaseline works better.  I highly recommend purchasing if you want something that actually get dead skin off your feet...</li>
    <li> Best one I have ever tried</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I normally groom my feet almost daily using a blade callous remover. I feel one need to, especially after wearing shoes that put stress and unsightly calluses on your feet.  I haven’t felt my feet this soft and smooth in some time. It works best when your feet are dry.  I Highly…recommend this product. - Meech</li>
    <li> Better then anything I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Just ok. The sheets are hard to get on and off and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> The item looks used. The package was dented, dirty and was opened in the box. The lettering on the handle is faded.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Nice light weight, perfect angle for less wrist fatigue. I&#x27;ll be ordering more for friends and fam!</li>
    <li> I bought this, in part, because of the positive reviews (both here, and elsewhere on the web.)  I&#x27;m not sure how everyone is using this thing to get such phenomenal results - but it was a dud for me.  It didn&#x27;t seem effective at all.  I tried it twice, but even after a fair amount of rubbing - the dead, calloused skin didn&#x27;t seem to budge.  I have one of those ped-egg like devices (different brand, same design) that I was hoping to replace with this, but nope.  I tossed the Sof-feet, and am back to the egg.  [And as an aside, out of curiousity I tried removing the screen to test how easy it would be to replace.  I could not do it.  The bolt that holds it on wouldn&#x27;t budge at all.  Maybe pliers are required?]</li>
    <li> I prefer the ped egg . it does a better job but I use this after and its great for that but I would not rely on this as your sole tool.</li>
    <li> I love this handheld callus remover.  I went to Home Depot to get drywall screen sander to cut refills.  Much cheaper than the refills offered. Great product. Bought one as a present too.</li>
    <li> Sof Feet is the answer to our prayers. Between my husband and I, we own a large collection of callus reducers and removers, we gone so far as making our own, but always being disappointed in them. Finally I saw a video on this product and realized that I needed to add Sof Feet to my collection. We are so happy to have callus free feet now. Needless to say I am trashing all of my other tools that are taking space in my pedicure kit and keeping the star of them all. For the first time in years we touched our feet under the covers and did not feel disgusted. It is magical.</li>
    <li> works really good on keeping my rough feet softer if I use it regularly and follow up with a quality moisturizer.</li>
    <li> If you are used to going to the spa/salon, this is not going to replace a professional…but it does help with the removal of dead skin.  You use this product dry which is a plus for me.  I am currently deployed to Afghanistan and my feet were so hard and crusty.  I started using this tool bi-weekly (as that is all I have time for) and it has helped out tremendously.  I went from snagging my sheets to about a 90% solution.  After four uses, I am still using the first screen.</li>
    <li> Had a terrible time with thick heels and cracks. Not anymore!Used as directed for three days and my feet look great. Now I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> Pumice stones--useless. Chemical callus removers--frightening. This thing--inexpensive, effective, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously tried a mild salicylic acid callus remover liquid I bought in a drugstore. It worked, kind of, but it was a slow process, painting the stinky stuff on day after day, and when the callus started to peel it peeled unevenly and turned white so my feet looked terrible and felt all rough and scratchy--worse than what I started with. I was thinking about getting a stronger chemical agent but got this instead and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool shaves off dead skin a little at a time, but very finely so I&#x27;m not left with any rough surfaces on my feet. It&#x27;s hard to tell from the photo but the surface is like a sandpaper screen stretched over a frame.</li>
    <li> Works nicely, order extra covers because you will need it. Also, don&#x27;t scrub hard because this thing works like sandpaper and can injur your skin. I like it but, don&#x27;t think it will take awy all dead skin for some.</li>
    <li> I came across this product online and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used for a callus reducer. I&#x27;m so happy that I got this and use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Does the job. IMO: it should include at least one replacement screen and where to order extra screens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting use to this type! I should have ordered replacements when I bought it. Not use to using on dry feet first but seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> This thing has been a miracle worker for my feet. I ha d calluses that were cracking and bleeding and this has helped immeasurably. I suggest using this regularly and on dry feet along with daily moisturizing. Oh - and pick up some extra screens so you can replace as needed.</li>
    <li> This is like a screen on a plastic strip. I was looking for something for rough feet. Maybe for finishing touches this would work, but for removing rough, tough calluses - forget it. Definently not worth the price!</li>
    <li> Another great grooming tool to add to the arsenal. I love this product. It works as advertised. Its very effective at removing calluses. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my feet and my hands from working out. It works wonders and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about how this would work but I have been very pleased with the results.  Leaves my feet smooth.</li>
    <li> it works when your feet are dry, was hoping it would be a little tougher though</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool to help smooth your heels.  It&#x27;s an acrylic handle with sheet rock screen stretch around it.  The sheet rock screen is a very good, yet mild, way to smooth out your feet for sandals.  I just buy the sheet rock screen and cut it to size when a refill is needed.  It works perfectly.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great - perfect for guys with thick callouses. If you have dainty callouses, get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely what a man needs to get rid of manly callouses, without being too sharp/abrasive that you&#x27;d end up hurting yourself / cutting up your feet or hands.&lt;br /&gt;For minor callouses, get something else.</li>
    <li> works good!!last longer!!!buy them!!!</li>
    <li> It works at first, but the scraping part loses effectiveness too fast to be viable for long term use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often but for this item I will&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used dry, this will be the best way to work those callous and hard heels to an incredible softness.&lt;br /&gt;Other grater type callous removers leave behind a grated feeling, making the need for additional sanding.&lt;br /&gt;Sof Feet  will amaze you.&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t pause before you click</li>
    <li> This is a nice addition to my foot scrub products.  I actually like this one.  To be used on dry feet, gets a lot of dry skin off, without hurting or over doing it.  Use your favorite foot softener lotion after and let your feet look and feel soft.</li>
    <li> Great gizmo.  Does work nicely.  I got two of these, one for the better half</li>
    <li> AS AN UPDATE OF THIS PAST REVIEW, SEE MY BELOW COMMENT RESPONDING TO MARTY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND NOW HERE&#x27;S MY PAST REVIEW FROM MONTHS BACK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who suffer from calluses on soles of feet, please refer to my uploaded pics (the ones with Red &amp; Black Arrows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, this is an excellent product concept, better than any other out there (in the past, I&#x27;ve wasted my money on various Harsh and Dangerous alternate products from Walmart &amp; other local stores.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that Sof Feet probably won&#x27;t include with their current product-photo, pics convenient for Sole Sufferers such as those i&#x27;ve uploaded. If they do change their current photo to include a 3\\&quot; x 2.5\\&quot; Sole Screen, they&#x27;re welcome to leave a Comment, and then I may upgrade my rating to 5 stars, if available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, worse than dry heels, I suffer from inflamed corns under calluses on the soles of my feet. I&#x27;m forced to walk alot, with my right foot taking alot of pressure, resulting in extreme soreness plus feeling black &amp; blue in that area.</li>
    <li> The Sof Feet Callus Reducer is by far the best solution I&#x27;ve ever encountered for &amp;#34;safely and effectively&amp;#34; reducing calluses.  Keep in mind, these sheets are two-sided and you can flip them over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to read my review about the replacement sheets.where I raise the question of convenience versus cost-effectiveness.  One needs to consider whether the diy method of cutting larger sheets of 100 grit silicone carbide drywall sanding screens into smaller 4&amp;#34; x 1.5&amp;#34; sheets using kitchen shears from the dollar store is worth it to them. The question here would be paying around $1 per sheet for replacements versus paying around 3 cents for diy replacements. Convenience versus cost effectiveness - the age old question  :)</li>
    <li> Beware - I went a little crazy with this at first and think I made my poor dry heels worse. I think moderation is key with this powerful tool. I think if you take off too much dry tough skin, you end up with dry thin skin that can crack easier and create other problems. And don&#x27;t forget to moisturize!</li>
    <li> OMG! I just used this a few minutes ago. Straight out of the box. I was skeptical at first to be honest. My feet were horrible and rough. Too excited and embarrassed to take a before pic. I have an after pic though. I&#x27;m so in love!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. make sure you use it on dry feet for supreme results. I only went over mine once.</li>
    <li> I expected this would have to be done after a good soaking, but you actually use it on dry feet. Best done in the tub just before taking a shower, because of the fine skin dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have been great to include just one replacement strip of the abrasive element: I was under the impression that this was some sort of metal micro planer without the need for any replacement parts. Not sure if it is mentioned in the product description: if it is, then it&#x27;s my fault for not being diligent enough.</li>
    <li> Skid gets stuck and it rusts.  Don&#x27;t keep in shower</li>
    <li> i bought this sof&#x27;feet callus reducer because of a video i saw on youtube.... I LOVE IT.... easy super effective ... it not only removes the callus  but leaves the area smooth at the same time.... the price couldnt be better and now that i see how great the product is im going to get the replacement screens.... thanks sof&#x27;feet!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just used this item while sitting on my porch.  When I was done, I had to vacuum - that&#x27;s either a measure of how callused my feet were or how effective this wonderful tool is or BOTH!!!  Throw away all the other ineffective crap you&#x27;ve bought to deal with your calluses - this callus remover is all you will ever need!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase &amp; it stops them from using the shaver when I get a pedicure. Helps keep the skin smooth!</li>
    <li> It may not be one of those fancy electric callus removers but who needs that when you can just put some elbow grease into it and take care of it yourself? It does the job and it looks like such a simple device that I am willing to bet you could make your own at home with a coarse screen and a wood handle.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve been having really bad foot pain because of a callus on my big toe and after 1 use of this, the pain isn&#x27;t there anymore!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works over time!</li>
    <li> This is THE real heel scrubber and more-to-reach foot areas, absolutely THE best beyond razors, pumex, etc. Get it! You will not regret it! Some kind of oil moisturizing after scrubbing is a plus!</li>
    <li> I have the worst heals, thick ugly cracked skin and this product takes care of them in seconds!  Of course you need good foot cream to keep them looking good.  But I have tried many things and this wins hands down.</li>
    <li> This really works!  Love it!  Better than the Ped Egg (or whatever it is called).</li>
    <li> I watched a YouTube video about this product and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I walk around barefoot in my house, and wear sandals during the warmer months,&lt;br /&gt;so my callouses build up and my heels have deep cracks in them.&lt;br /&gt;I have had pedicures done at establishments that use a chemical peel, a razor&lt;br /&gt;device, and sanding sponges, and all work to varying degrees, though a few times&lt;br /&gt;too much callous has been removed and my heels sting for the better part of a&lt;br /&gt;week afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;This product does a good job of sanding dead skin off, and it is best used on dry feet.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are softer and the cracks are much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I am putting cream on my feet and wearing socks to maintain the softness.&lt;br /&gt;The main advantage of purchasing the tool is to continue maintenance between&lt;br /&gt;pedicures, or to save money by doing them yourself.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package the first time, my husband immediately recognized the&lt;br /&gt;sanding squares as drywall screen, so I would recommend not purchasing the refill&lt;br /&gt;package for an extra $10 as I did. You could probably buy a sheet of drywall screen&lt;br /&gt;at the hardware store and cut it into small squares for less expense than the precut&lt;br /&gt;refills.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this item for a long time.  I get huge calluses my heels and have purchased several different removers over the years that broke or wore out quickly.  I haven&#x27;t owned the item for long but so far it beats every other one I ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This thing is great!  Quickly and safely files away those peeled ends.  MUCH better results than the Pedi Egg and not at all scary like it is.  No worry of gouging too deep with this!  I have toss my Pedi Egg along with a couple of other foot files that I had lying around.  Will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is a lifesaver for me!  I live in Colorado where the winters are harsh, cold, and dry.  It&#x27;s important to be careful about the amount of pressure used, however.  Just experiment.</li>
    <li> As long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve had problems with calluses on my heels. I&#x27;ve tried all the tools including the PedEgg but found the tools that look like a metal nail file with plastic handle worked best. Unfortunately, they were throw-away items, lasting maybe a year. The metal was thin, they&#x27;d bend and I&#x27;d bent them flat again. But every single one, eventually, the plastic handle would crack and break. Big problem was that they weren&#x27;t Full Tang (metal running the entire length thru the handle end). And it&#x27;d take me lots of time filing the calluses with it&#x27;s skinny surface area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was very hesitant to spend more money, yet again, on another callus reducer. Ideally, I wanted a full metal one that was structurally rigid. I came up on the Sof Feet searching thru Amazon and like what I read, but was not happy with the dreaded plastic handle, and kept searching off and on for days. All I could imagine was that it would flex, bend, and eventually break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With much hesitation, I ordered the Sof Feet. I got the Sof Feet today, tried it out, and am sold on it. I believe it&#x27;s the last callus reducer I&#x27;ll have to buy. The handle is thick, much like plexiglass, heavy duty, no flex. I doubt it will ever break. In fact, with the screen they use for the abrasive being so effective, the amount of pressure needed to apply is MUCH LESS. With my unscientific analysis, I think my time has been cut down 10x to get the same results. That is a time saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that I really like is the refill system. Of course I didn&#x27;t buy any refills as I wasn&#x27;t sold on the quality of this product yet. But the best way to describe this tool is &amp;#34;commercial grade&amp;#34;. Right after publishing this review, I&#x27;m spending more money with Sof Feet and ordering the refills so I have them on ready standby whenever the original one wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this tool, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I wish the mesh would last a bit longer before needing to be changed but I will continue to use it&lt;br /&gt;as long as it works as well as it does...</li>
    <li> Love this product, sawva review of it on you tube, tried it, works great.  Can be used on dry feet. Easy to store as well.</li>
    <li> I tried the &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; Egg Callus Remover and was not at all satisfied. It took forever and didn&#x27;t do a very good job. This item is very easy to use and does an excellent job. It maneuvers around your foot with ease and leaves them smooth and without irritation, unlike the EGG. I also like the fact that you can purchase replacement screens.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The handle is llog enough that I can stand and reach my foot and heal.  The wire mess remove dead skin easily and makes my feet very smooth.</li>
    <li> I made it my mission in life to find the best heel smoothing device or product and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet! I have the ped egg and that one takes larger pieces of skin and it&#x27;s necessary to use a file to get your heels smooth afterwards so that is a two-step process. I have the Emoji machine and that one takes a new roller every time to see any difference ( at $19 per 2 rollers it gets expensive) and it takes 10 times longer...no, 20 times than this file here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a tropical island so I&#x27;m always barefoot and if I don&#x27;t do anything my heels become cracked dry and look terrible! No girl wants &#x27; island feet&#x27;! Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so seriously impressed with this file that I am going to order refills after writing this review! I have no idea how long each screen will last but it took me seriously less than 10 minutes to do both my feet; heels and toes with this. You definitely want to use this on dry feet and you can see how much of the dry skin is coming off with each tap of the file against your sink or towel. My feet were left silky baby smooth and no additional filing with any other product was necessary other than a rinse &amp; some lotion. Seriously impressive!</li>
    <li> I wont be going back to the pedicure salon. Finally found what I need and have been looking for. Very simple and easy to use. This takes off all the built up old skin off my feet. I could not be happier. Thank you Amazon for carrying this.</li>
    <li> soft feet...love it...</li>
    <li> This tool is so handy and effective. I could not believe how easy it was to use. Callouses are gone! No pain. Soft soft feet. Buy - you will NOT regret!</li>
    <li> This is the very very very very very best product I HAVE EVER used on my feet.  It is amazing.  My feet havent been this soft in years.  The callouses simply fell off in a fine dust as I scrubbed them with this thing.  Make sure to use it dry.  It doesnt work when wet.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple of weeks.  Best I have ever seen.  It is like sand paper for your feet.  I have to do this outside as it kicks up so much skin dust.</li>
    <li> Ugly feet.  I have them.  Dry, cracked, and lots of calluses.  I have been searching for the right tools and/or products to help tame them.  I happened across a reviewer on YouTube who recommended the Sof Feet Callus Reducer in combination with Sole Food cream.  I ordered both products and am 100% satisfied. The reducer should be used on DRY feet before showering/bathing, and before applying any lotion or cream.  I put a towel under my feet to catch the &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; and go to work on the calluses.  When the screen gets &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;...I just tap it on the towel to empty it.  When I am done, I wash my feet and then apply Sole Food cream.  Another Youtube reviewer recommend just picking up drywall sanding screens to do the same thing, but I like having a handle to to grip.  However, I will probably buy some to use for replacements in the Sof Feet rasp.</li>
    <li> This rasp for sanding calluses is very simply made of 1/4 inch thick \\&quot;plexi-glass\\&quot; material. It is 7 1/2 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide and of very sturdy construction. I had assumed from the product description that the \\&quot;screen\\&quot; was of metal construction; it simply uses pieces of drywall sanding screen material &#x3D; 100 grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to buying this product, I had been using half sheets of Norton&#x27;s WallSand Waterproof Drywall Screen - 120 grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also ordered the 5 pack of replacement screens from Amazon; I would suggest that you can cut your own screens, a ten pack from Amazon or a home improvement store, costs less than $1 per sheet. You can cut a total of 10 \\&quot;replacement screens\\&quot; from a single sheet. The cost therefore being about 10 cents per piece, instead of the $1.38 each from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this tool is a \\&quot;step up\\&quot; in caring for my feet, it sure is a lot easier than my old method!</li>
    <li> This is the best callus remover.....definitely gets the job done right...leaves feet soft and smooth with no pain or soreness</li>
    <li> As every other woman has, I&#x27;ve been through every foot product out there....pumice, Pedi Egg, callous removing creams and lotions, even light sandpaper (yep). This product is, hands down, the best callus remover I&#x27;ve found yet.  It takes down the built up spots quickly and softens up the rough patches.  It only takes a minute of &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34;.  No need to soak your feet first, this really only works on dry feet...which is a great time saver.  I use it on my feet 3 or 4 times a week (only takes a couple minutes) before I go to bed, and follow up by using a foot cream and slipper socks so my tootsies can get quenched overnight.  By morning, my feet are looking good! You&#x27;ll want to lay a towel underneath your feet while using this, or sit on the edge of the bathtub...there will be a LOT of skin powder coming off.  Every once in a while you&#x27;ll need to band the scrubber lightly to knock the build-up off skin out of the screen.  So happy I found this!</li>
    <li> You will not believe what comes off of your feet with this thing! Easy to use and works really well. Leaves your feet callus free and soft.</li>
    <li> works better than anything I have used, it is the only thing that has taken the calluses off totally,  I am thrilled and highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well on wet feet and it seems that the screen needs to be replaced very often.  Hence, I went back to the regular tool that works well on wet feet.</li>
    <li> I ordered based on reading amazon reviews. The product arrived in 2 days, cirections are simple to follow and the construction makes reaching bottom of feetbvery easy. Within 2 minutes of use the worst of my calluses were gone. You don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure and the rough skin comes right off.</li>
    <li> This item does the job well enough -- after using it, my feet feel like I&#x27;ve spent the day running on the beach. However, it gets quite messy. It basically functions as sandpaper, reducing the dried/dead skin to a powdery mess. For this reason, I recommend using it outside. In your back yard, out of the sight of your neighbors.</li>
    <li> Maybe my expectations were simply too high. The sandpaper fills up quickly, performs poorly once full, and is a pain to clear. It smoothes the surface of my heels, but even when I press down very hard cannot seem to help me shed the thicker rough patches on my heels. This is okay, but sadly I&#x27;d toss it as soon as something better comes along.</li>
    <li> My roommate has dry skin and this product is great!  It doesn&#x27;t cut away skin like other removers do and it&#x27;s very effective. Only 4 stars because it&#x27;s obvious that the screen needs to be replaced and so it might not be that cost effective at the end.</li>
    <li> I have used at least 9 different callous removers. I have used mechanical and creams. This one is by far THE best. This is the first review I have written and am so excited I just had to put a review in!</li>
    <li> This is a good tool to get rid of callus on feet. I tried the Pedegg and that was a waste of money. I also use the foot shaver from my local drug store as shaving the callus is the best.</li>
    <li> Im a regular sandal wearer so I tend to get calluses on my big toe near the side/bottom. And also around the heel slightly. Its not crazy like some ladies you see where its cracking just slightly. I have used ped eggs and saw the high reviews for this and decided to give it a go. And the reviews were right on works great and in a matter of minutes. Also another reviewer mentioned you can buy the replacement screens for much cheaper at home depot which I will do. My toes are super soft and love rubbing my bf with my toes under the covers now! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried 4 different products for callous removal and all of them barely work.  None of them actually completed the job.  It required much rubbing back and forth which resulted in a sore heel...brush burn.&lt;br /&gt;This unit removes a lot with very little pressure and no pain or sensitivity after use.  I had a crack in one heel and it removed the skin and eliminated the crack without any after pain.  It is sturdy in construction and you will need some refill disks.&lt;br /&gt;This product is the real deal!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few things and like these the best so far.  does peel off dead skin remarkably fast without blades.  i would like it to have come with a few more refills. I&#x27;d have given the last star for more refills.  i&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this as an add on item. It doesn&#x27;t work for removing calluses or smoothing heels and is basically worthless.</li>
    <li> Fast and inexpensive way to remove callus.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used!  This was a replacement for one that broke when I dropped it on a tile floor after having it a long time.  I have given several others as gifts.  The screens last quite a while and are easy to clean.  Replacement of the screen is also very easy!!</li>
    <li> Best tool for my feet I have EVER USED.  Immediate results the very first time I used it.  I&#x27;m ordering for my family and friends.</li>
    <li> It is very soft for me though my feed are not bad  but it does not reduce the callus very well.</li>
    <li> I recommend this item for those of us with active, rough feet.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your feet feeling sandpaperish after use.  It&#x27;s great in the shower even though it&#x27;s recommended to use on dry feet.  Periodic use will leave your feet feeling &amp;#34;Sof&amp;#34; and smooth.  A good moisturizing cream or lotion will help too after use.</li>
    <li> Holy bejeezus is this thing awesome!!  When I tell you, that I&#x27;ve tried nearly every foot product (and cream and baggy) out there, I&#x27;m not lying.  I even have that rotating amope thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took very little elbow grease and my heels are looking and feeling spectacular!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend if you have hard heels like I do!</li>
    <li> As well as doing a good job for large areas of the feet, the Sof Feet Callus Reducer also is very good at getting in the nooks and crannies near the toes. I actually use the narrow part where the mesh wraps around the base to get in especially tight places. And if you only have a small area you want to scrape, this feature allows you to do that easily.&lt;br /&gt;The product feels solid and seems like it will last a long time. It also is a handy size and fits into my little bag I keep all my clippers and things in, which is a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have horrible calluses so I can&#x27;t say if it will cramp your hand if you use it a long time, but it seems okay.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I can get replacement screens once this wears out seems like a nice feature. Even though it kind of reminds me of a sander my dad uses. But I guess you are just sanding dead skin off of your feet. So it works.</li>
    <li> Excellent, thank you.</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve never used one of these before but for as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve always had rough feet and a callus that always comes back on both of my big toes. Using this every so often does just the trick! It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve got brand new feet. Very soft and great for footsie~</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed an exceptional difference.. I use it in the shower 2 or 3 times a week. Does an OK job of scrubbing your feet and maintain it.</li>
    <li> Seems a bit pricey for a bent piece of thick plastic. On the other hand, it does exactly what it says it will do; and it does it very well. As other reviewers have noted, don&#x27;t bother with the replacement screens. Just go to the hardware store, buy some sanding mesh (which is what these &amp;#34;screens&amp;#34; actually are), and cut it to size. It&#x27;ll cost a fraction of the replacements.</li>
    <li> It was alright, but it didn&#x27;t work as effectively as I thought it would. I work as a nail technician. I just wanted to try out this product and see if it worked, but it wasn&#x27;t as effective in scrubbing off thick calluses. It just skims away at the surface a bit and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even skim the surface skin away.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Removes calluses easily.</li>
    <li> its the closest and safest alternative to razor blading your calluses off...works quickly and precisely without leaving you in pain! combine this with a foot cream and your set!</li>
    <li> Excellent  Excellent  Excellent!  Excellent. Excellent.  I will never worry about rough heels again.  Buy this with the Sole Food Foot Cream and you&#x27;ll never worry about tearing hose or unsightly rough heels again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. My feet are like leather and this works and leaves them smooth. Unlike the cheese grater type which never leaves my feet smooth. A lot less effort than anything I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this purchase!!! I have never been able to remove the calluses from my feet before. Within minutes of using this product, I had soft, smooth feet for the first time in years.</li>
    <li> This might work on very light callusing, didnt do anything to the thick calluses on my feet. Get a pedi egg if you want somthing that works on calluses or if you want something cheap get a heavy emory board.</li>
    <li> I really hoped that this would solve my problems with calluses and rough feet.  The other reviews are true.  If you do it too much it will hurt your feet.  I think that other products are much better.  Just something about this I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Could never be without this tool. Better than ALL I tried. My feet are as smooth as a babys</li>
    <li> The Sof Feet Callus Reducer is essentially a rasp which does indeed reduce callouses to \\&quot;skin level,\\&quot; and it does that faster and more efficiently than a pumice stone or other \\&quot;rough skin\\&quot; removers. It&#x27;s actually quite gentle and leave the skin smooth. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how long it will be before I need a callous remover, but I&#x27;m guessing 6 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great little invention. I&#x27;m only sorry it wasn&#x27;t invented 20 years ago.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised. Works better than competetitor&#x27;s product[Pedegg]. Easy to use and appears to be of high quality. Delivered as predicted.</li>
    <li> Bought this with high hopes. Tried to use it and it did almost nothing. There are so many products for this that do a better job. Seek those out, instead.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job of reducing callouses and smoothing rough spots.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend, works great.</li>
    <li> This does work but I prefer using the razor shavers on moist feet. They are not as safe but I don&#x27;t like the dry skin floating in the air. Ugh. I will still use it but would not buy another one.</li>
    <li> Greatest foot product for men with severely calloused feet like mines. I walk a lot.</li>
    <li> I have tried every kind of callus remover for my feet and my calluses just laugh in their face.  Well they aren&#x27;t laughing now!</li>
    <li> This item works well!  It is very easy to use and convient.  I would recommend this item. Very lightweight but sturdy.</li>
    <li> I bought this after starting Kendo. Kendo is done bare foot on wood floors which for feet that have seen shoes for well over a decade for all outdoor wear, it is really brutal starting out. This tool is excellent at removing all of the dead dry skin.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ll  be dog on....  It works.  The best thing I&#x27;ve ever used.  As soon as the package arrived I read the material  and it stated that it could be used on dry feet...  I was like yeah right...  I swear by this product!!!</li>
    <li> I basically live in heels. A terrible habit, but I walk like a duck when I wear flat shoes. :x&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure I don&#x27;t end up with gnarled, callused ridden soles, I figured this callus reducer would be a great way to keep my dainty feet cute &amp; touchable. I liked the concept of a replaceable file. For the first month, I was smitten. It did exactly what it was meant to do: remove/reduce the garbage that made feet gross &amp; got my monkey toes ready for sandal season! Yaaayyyyy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after I replaced the screen/scrubby/exfoliation piece, what was once my &#x27;foot miracle worker&#x27; has become lazy at best. The screen keeps slipping out of place &amp; rotates when I&#x27;m doing my daily foot scrub-- the acrylic hardware meant to lock the exfoliator tool in place now rotates while I scrub. I&#x27;ve tried tightening w/ pliers, but slipping still occurs. To be honest, it&#x27;s almost as frustrating as sitting in rush hour traffic. In Los Angeles. It looks like this, but without the beauty: http://amzn.to/1ok60m0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s okay at best, but you might be better off purchasing a lifetime supply of the wood handled pumice stones that will eventually rot &amp; make your shower moldy. At least those files stay in place....</li>
    <li> It takes a lot of manual labor depending on your foot, but it works great!!</li>
    <li> Thank you! Item as promised!</li>
    <li> Wow! My heels haven&#x27;t looked this good in 20 years! I&#x27;ve just used it once and it was really easy! Thanks, Sof Feet!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work any better or worse than any of the other callus reducers out there. It&#x27;s the highest quality of reducer I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;ve bought them all. It&#x27;s a perfect gift for a gift basket of foot related products as it screams 5-star resort quality - very heavy duty and luxurious looking. I&#x27;m impressed with the construction, heft and feel of it. As far as it working better than anything else? Not so much. It DOES last longer than the crap you buy at Walmart or CVS or even Bed Bath and Beyond, but it is just a hair above the other stuff in performance. The longer you soak your feet the better. I would use/prefer or buy it over any other unit simply because of the quality of construction and the look and heft of it. Very substantial, worth the price. I guess I&#x27;m just looking for that miracle reducer that CAN tackle my callused feet with some kind of magic. This comes close, but not quite there for me.</li>
    <li> My feet look and feel softer than they did after my last pedicure!  That was ten months ago, and I was so disappointed after paying for an ineffective callus removal treatment.  The nail tech said I should come back every two months, which after that service, seemed like a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this little tool, I don&#x27;t have to pay for salon services anymore!  I can safely maintain my skin as often as it needs it, and my feet are sandal ready after just one use.  If you&#x27;re shopping around for an excellent home pedicure tool, the Sof Feet Callus Reducer is the way to go!</li>
    <li> This is great! Leaves your feet feeling very soft and wonderful. It&#x27;s definitely a great buy, very recommended. Your feet will thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using this along with Zim&#x27;s crack cream and my feet are in better shape and softer than they have been in years. I haven&#x27;t found that the screen gets dulled quickly, but intend (and meant to when I ordered this) to buy replacement screens for when I do need to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like this better than the Ped Egg and definitely better than a callous blade.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my partner. It is okay. I feel like there are better ones out there. It is messy so make sure you have a paper towel or something underneath where you are going to be using this. I don&#x27;t think that it goes &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; enough to fully get your feet free of scaly, dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a foot scraper.  It does its advertised function.  It does it well.  I really don&#x27;t have anything more to say about it!</li>
    <li> When I opened the package, it looked like sandpaper on a stick. I was surprised at how efficient this was for removing dead skin on the heels. I don&#x27;t have extremely thick callus but this smoothed away dry scaly heels in a snap. Was also pain free. Used with olkeefs healthy feet which kept the dry skin away.</li>
    <li> Just throw away all your pumice stones and skin filers. This is really the best tool out there to quickly reduce calluses and corns painlessly.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, but the reviews were so good I decided to try it.  I have used EVERY file, scraper, etc. made for feet with only mediocre success.  My feet are always dry and I have nerve damage.  This product seems to be made of a heavy-duty, hand-friendly piece of Lucite with an attached piece of rectangular screen - maybe even thick window screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this callous file is that it is easy to hold, appears sturdy (so the handle isn&#x27;t going to snap/break if pressure is applied), and the screen removes dead skin smoothly.  There was no tugging, gouging, or tearing of the skin.  I stroked in one direction with medium pressure and it did a great job.  There were no snags when I finished.  Then I applied foot cream and put on cotton socks for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In bed this morning, my heels didn&#x27;t feel rough against my legs and they didn&#x27;t catch on the sheets.  What a huge improvement.  I am very happy with this product.  I DO think it should have come with at least one replacement screen (wouldn&#x27;t have cost them a nickel!).  But additional screens are available thru AMZN and I intend to order some (or maybe I&#x27;ll cut my own).</li>
    <li> This device has my feet smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. It&#x27;s best to use on dry feet. The residue will easily clog the screens when used on wet feet. I don&#x27;t have the problem of scrubbing too much the other reviewer. I bought a pack of replacement screens.</li>
    <li> Works great on dry feet.....don&#x27;t try if your feet are damp after shower.</li>
    <li> I got one of these from my podiatrist at least 6 years ago. After much use, it recently broke.  I was so glad to be able to buy another from Amazon.  This is a great callus reducer.  Use it on dry feet or skin to scrape away calluses or dead skin.  I use mine on all dry skin patches, including to exfoliate my legs before I shave.  It can be a little harsh on legs,etc - so be careful how much pressure you use. It is the best callus remover available.  Buy the screen refills when you order it!</li>
    <li> I bought this device after watching a youtube video from a lady that recommends the drywall mesh for sanding your feet. At the beginning I just bought the mesh and it gave me fabulous results but having this product makes the job a lot easier. This one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Not bad, does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh! This works so well! I am hooked!</li>
    <li> The absolutely best file ever! Makes doing my husbands feet so much easier now. The magic is in the screen. What ever material they use makes filing the callus a breeze. When your done just rinse and air dry for the next pedicure. This product comes with a couple of replaceable filing screens. I also ordered a 12 pack of screens at the same for a really reasonable price here on Amazon for back up. Very happy about my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product worked well initially, but I don&#x27;t think the results were very lasting. I&#x27;ll try and use it on a very regular basis for the next couple of weeks and possibly update my review.</li>
    <li> Just was one word I have - amazing!  I always had very dry callused feet and ruffed looken heels. This product is so amazing b/c just using it for the first time gave me smooth beautiful heels. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Never thought I would be so impressed with this little unassuming gadget. This tool works miracles on DRY skin. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying this. Now that I have received it and used it, I am wondering if all of those reviewers work for the company. Let&#x27;s put it this way. You are paying for a nice plexigass handle. If you really have tough feet, all this does is make nice to your feet but hardly beefy enough to remove serious callouses. On the other hand, if you have fifi feet and you want a cool looking product and a little more than a massage and scrathing, buy this. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t return something like this . . . or I would.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! I am a nurse so the twelve hour shifts do the job on my feet.  This callus reducer works a ton better than a pumice stone and leave my feet soft and callus-free!</li>
    <li> It does take off the skin nicely and makes the feet smooth. It is definitely the best callus remover I have tried so far. I got the refills too, and it should last me a long time.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I have horribly dry feet as I live in a cold climate, and I have lots of built up calluses and dry skin areas on my feet. I typically use a salon board on the heaviest grit and I plow through them. This thing doesn&#x27;t use chemicals or peels or cremes or blades or a motor. I still cannot believe how much stuff comes off of my feet. I will use this forever.</li>
    <li> I saw this product highlighted on a youtube video and was very impressed until I read some of the reviews that stated it didn&#x27;t work. I was skeptical about ordering but the woman in the video seemed so sincere! Well this product works EXACTLY as she said it would. It got rid of the hard patch of callus on the ball of my feet in 2 days and the callus on the side of my big toe is now a memory! My feet were bad, and if you&#x27;re looking for a product that will do what it advertises, then you will definitely want to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous callous removers and nothing has worked until I found this product.  Make sure to use it when feet are dry and you will see results immediately!  Get ready for great feet for the summer!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as she wears sandals often which seems to make her heals very dry. When she uses this it helps and she doesn&#x27;t complain about it hurting like some other methods.</li>
    <li> The best thing I have ever used for dry skin on my feet ! I&#x27;ve tried so many different things and this one does the trick as soon as you use it the first time ! I usually use it outside so I can clean it as I use it on my feet by hitting it lightly on the side of my steps into the grass. I would def buy again and encurage anybody with callus issues to use</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am deployed at the moment and going to get my feet done every other week is not an option.  I used this as soon as it came in and OMG it&#x27;s awesome!  My calloused feet from my boots are loving the callus reducer!</li>
    <li> It was delivered early and wrapped very well. But as to being great it is not. I finally just went to the podiatrist to get rid of my calluses. I did find out I needed orthotics to put in my shoes to prevent getting anymore calluses. The doctor gave me a prescription for them and I believe they will be very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had been helpful. The pumas stone was better and did not cost as much. I would like to return it but do not know if they will take it back. I used it twice and it never did much. From the video I saw on YouTube made me think it would be so great and I could really get rid of my calluses but alas it just was not true.</li>
    <li> I know I&#x27;m only one of a hundred reviews, and I don&#x27;t write them often unless a product is super good, or super bad.  Well, this one is way over SUPER!  Like I said I have shopped with Amazon for many, many years and this is the absolute best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased of any kind.  It works like a dream, safe, and definitely makes the feet super, super soft.  And, on top of it, it is actually made in the USA!  I called the company that makes it, and they said that they&#x27;ve been manufacturing them for over 20 years....but I&#x27;m now just finding out about them.  It was that shaver thing on TV that got me to searching for something safer.  My husband has diabetes and congestive heart failure, which causes the blood to pool in the lower extremities, and especially the feet, so I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances with something that would actually cut him, or me, and this is perfect.  When my sister saw it, she not only was impressed but thought that the screens that actually do the job are similar if not the same thing that is used by sheetrock installers to lightly sand before painting.  It makes a lot of sense.  Ok, I rambling, but just wanted to share my experience with this little gadget. Well worth the money.</li>
