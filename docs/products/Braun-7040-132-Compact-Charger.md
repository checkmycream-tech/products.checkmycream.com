      <li>The size is perfect for travel (way better than the tower charger that comes with the brush).</li>
      <li>How nice to buy just the charger when that&#x27;s all you need!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still fairly bulky  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted to have it since I no longer need to pester my wife, and my toothbrush is fully charged at all times.   </li>
      <li>Good inexpensive charger.  </li>
      <li>It was as if I had ordered it new from the manufacturer - perfectly packaged and working beautifully.</li>
      <li>I love it, it works great and was just what I was looking for to travel with</li>
      <li>I bought this compact charger and I have been very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>Great quality item, glad I found and bought it.</li>
      <li>Placed an order on this compact version (much better than my dremel-tooled saw-down version) and anticipated its arrival with great trepidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Was glad to find this charger which works great.</li>
      <li>When we plugged it in in Budapest, with appropriate converter for Europe, it wouldn&#x27;t work!</li>

      <li>Nice and compact for my travel kit.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled.</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s working perfectly and way cheaper than buying a new toothbrush</li>
      <li>I bought this as an additional (and travel) charger for my Oral B Professional Series 3250 brush and it works great!</li>
      <li>good as the original.</li>
      <li>And, two more points that were very good surprises: I love that this small charger looks much better on the bathroom counter and that it&#x27;s perfect for traveling.</li>
      <li>Bought this because my toothbrush was bought in Europe and it has worked fine without any problem whatsoever!</li>
      <li>Charger has been working fine though it runs a bit warm</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
      <li>It is the charger that I use, and is better than others that I have had.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>Glad there is an alternative to buying another $100 toot rush set when your charger goes.</li>
      <li>We like this one better.</li>
      <li>But I thought give it one more try.</li>
      <li>So if it looks like the shape of the charger you need, it may be appropriate.</li>
      <li>We needed a second charger and this was perfect!</li>
      <li>and it is authentic</li>
      <li>Package arrived safe and intact via USPS 3 days after I ordered.</li>
      <li>but I just wish for more truth/accuracy in the offer.</li>
      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t have to throw out my 2 braun toothbrushes units, because the charger stopped working</li>
      <li>works perfectly and is more compact than many other charging bases.</li>
      <li>The new charger has worked great and saved me from having to replace the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Toothbrush fits on top of the peg holder just fine, without any imbalances or shaking.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new unit - perfect.</li>
      <li>This charger is much more compact and user friendly for use in my motorhome.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this one for over a month now and its still going strong.  </li>
      <li>It arrived on time and works fine.</li>
      <li>work fine with our Magellan converters.  </li>
      <li>The replacement works fine, but I do not leave it plugged in after the toothbrush has charged for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
      <li>This was a fine buy.</li>
      <li>Smooth transaction.</li>
      <li>While searching for a replacement on-line I found that a compact charger was also available at a lower cost.  </li>
      <li>that I felt comfortable ordering one.</li>
      <li>This is great to get as an extra charger.</li>
      <li>This one is much smaller and easier to pack and works great.  </li>
      <li>It looks exactly as it should, it works exactly as it should and it arrived in good time.</li>
      <li>The best part is the size, it travels easy and takes up a small amount of space on the counters.</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s more compact than Braun&#x27;s other toothbrush chargers, but is by no means a good _travel_ charger:  </li>
      <li>you always carry around your huge original charger with the toothbrush head compartment on vacations, you owe it to yourself to grab this one; save you a headache too if you lose it or it gets destroyed.</li>
      <li>Not only does it charge faster than the larger upright model, the charge lasts longer and it is much more compact, perfect for traveling.</li>
      <li>The original charger for my Braun toothbrush stopped working after 6 years.  </li>
      <li>My original Braun charger no longer was charging and found this replacement on your website.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Works just as well as the original charger (US)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I returned home the toothbrush did charge using the original charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I had to buy a replacement charger after the original one busted abroad</li>
      <li>We had to get this as a replacement charger because the son took the original to college.  </li>
      <li>The price was right, too!</li>
      <li>Works great and takes up less space than the original charger.</li>
      <li>Great little device; very useful to anyone who bought or buys electric brushes two at a time.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this charger to replace my old original one.</li>
      <li>I ordered a replacement charger it arrived in less than 10 days to my APO address excellant service and a great charger.</li>
      <li>This is a great little compact charger for my toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>I destroyed the original charger by plugging into a cheap voltage converter in New Zealand.  </li>
      <li>came as expected and works great, thanks</li>
      <li>Also, this size charger would be better for frequent travelers.</li>
      <li>For many years we have used a set of two Braun Professional electric tooth brush handles that shared one tower charger.  </li>
      <li>Smaller, lighter and equally effective is a must for motorhomes.  </li>
      <li>works fine with my older Panasonic toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Wish it was a full range of 100-240 like most personal appliances anymore.</li>
      <li>Great small toothbrush carger.  </li>
      <li>It works fine, even though the description and customer reviews did not mention that it would also work for our Braun model (Professional Care</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this compact charger.  It works perfectly with my Braun 3D Excel which I have had for years.</li>
    <li> Had to get a charger for myself since my mother bought a 2 pack of Braun Oral B Professional Care Series 3250 and that only came with one charger. Since this is my first foray into electric toothbrushes, I had no idea about the chargers or what type to get. The numbers (specifically, the DXX.XXX.X numbers) in the manual were not very clear and I could not find a match in the product description. And since the product features and product descriptions do not match, I was also a bit confused as to which one was the correct one. It wasn&#x27;t until I saw someone else&#x27;s review that it works with model 4729 that I felt comfortable ordering one. Package arrived safe and intact via USPS 3 days after I ordered. Charger has been working fine though it runs a bit warm but that&#x27;s nothing to worry about. Also, this size charger would be better for frequent travelers.</li>
    <li> works perfectly and is more compact than many other charging bases.</li>
    <li> After an unfortunate surge on a trip to Lebanon, I found that my old Braun charger had developed a cancerous looking bump on its underbelly and refused to charge my toothbrush. Placed an order on this compact version (much better than my dremel-tooled saw-down version) and anticipated its arrival with great trepidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything about this charge is great. The cables seem durable but are malleable enough that you can easily maneuver the cable around your other bathroom belongings. The charger&#x27;s plastic is well made and not too flimsy. Toothbrush fits on top of the peg holder just fine, without any imbalances or shaking. Charging begins immediately with no hums or whines.&lt;br /&gt;Unit runs a little warm, but this is no big issue; also there is no smell emitted from the warming plastic, which was also a slight concern for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you always carry around your huge original charger with the toothbrush head compartment on vacations, you owe it to yourself to grab this one; save you a headache too if you lose it or it gets destroyed.</li>
    <li> Bought this to take to Europe and didn&#x27;t use it prior to departure. When we plugged it in in Budapest, with appropriate converter for Europe, it wouldn&#x27;t work! Nothing, dead! Do not buy this! We bought it several months ago so we&#x27;re stuck with it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Bought this as a replacement charger for my Oral B electric toothbrush. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an additional (and travel) charger for my Oral B Professional Series 3250 brush and it works great! The size is perfect for travel (way better than the tower charger that comes with the brush). It charges in the same way as the one that came with the brush. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this charger would work with my brush prior to ordering so I took a chance, so if you are wondering...it definitely works with the Professional Series 3250 brush.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my used toothbrush as the old one went out when I tried to plug it into a foreign outlet.  I&#x27;ve had this one for over a month now and its still going strong.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> This charger is easier to carry with you when you travel. That tall, tower shaped charger gets in the way, gets knocked over, etc.  We like this one better.</li>
    <li> I purchased a set of the Oral B Professional Care 3728 from Costco but unfortunately it came with only one charger for two toothbrushes. I bought this compact charger and I have been very pleased with the product. Like other Oral B products this charger is also made in Germany. I have used this on a regular basis for the past few months and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. Its compact size makes is convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s compact, light and fits the travel bag for those long trips that will drain your battery. a must buy for the traveller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ver happy and satisfied with my order!!!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had to buy a replacement charger after the original one busted abroad (forgot to use a converter).  This came with fast delivery, was packaged nicely, and works great!  The small size is much easier to pack than the normal large tower.</li>
    <li> The seller response emails fast and is helpful. They helped me to find a 100~240v model to exchange the bought one, which only fits American standard.</li>
    <li> I have a 7400 model toothbrush which I&#x27;ve had since 2004 and also a newer model Braun toothbrush. Both are Oral B.  I ordered this product and I was a little nervous that it wouldn&#x27;t fit my toothbrushes since the models that I have were not listed.  When I received it I was very happy because it fits and we are travelers so the size is perfect.  It looks exactly like the chargers that came with the toothbrushes but a whole lot smaller. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping and exactly as advertised.  This charger is much easier to travel with than the big bulky charger that comes with the toothbrush.  It&#x27;s also a Braun product not some aftermarket crap.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a toothbrush charger. It looks exactly as it should, it works exactly as it should and it arrived in good time. Everything Good!</li>
    <li> This charger performs its function properly and is of a small enough size to be carried on trips.  This item was NIB.</li>
    <li> Our original Braun-OralB base died on a trip to Europe, so we bought this replacement. It is small and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I think this charger is a missed opportunity.  Sure, it&#x27;s more compact than Braun&#x27;s other toothbrush chargers, but is by no means a good _travel_ charger:  - It does not handle 240v  - It&#x27;s still fairly bulky  - The cord is fairly long and has a standard, non-folding plug    In my experience the toothbrush battery does not last long enough for a two week vacation so you need to bring this along.  If you need to get a voltage converter make sure you get one that can handle low wattages!  The charger only draws something like 5 watts.</li>
    <li> Bought this because my toothbrush was bought in Europe and it has worked fine without any problem whatsoever! I have used it a bunch of times since I bought it last year without any problem.</li>
    <li> I have an older Oral B 3d Excel with a tower charger.  I bought this one for travel and it works great.</li>
    <li> I needed a compact charger to replace the second normal-sized one that had been broken by traveling with it.  I was so glad to be able to find a small one at a reasonable price.  This one is much smaller and easier to pack and works great.  No complaints here!</li>
    <li> This is a great little compact charger for my toothbrush.  I used to take my toothbrush with me and hope that the charge would last for the entire trip, which was not always the case.  This is a great little appliance that I can pack with all my other chargers for a trip lasting longer than 3 or 4 days. I wish they came with or along-side all electric toothbrushes!  The price was right, too!</li>
    <li> Bought a Braun package at Costco that had 2 brush units but only 1 charger. Brush units are not used in the same place and by different family members. We needed a second charger and this was perfect!</li>
    <li> Great small toothbrush carger.  This charger is much more compact and user friendly for use in my motorhome.  Smaller, lighter and equally effective is a must for motorhomes.  Highly recommended for RV use.</li>
    <li> I was dubious that Amazon would have such a product.  I ordered it and it was here in about four days and it is authentic and it is not a book!</li>
    <li> This product works great. The best part is the size, it travels easy and takes up a small amount of space on the counters. I purchased this because I do a lot of traveling for weeks at time. When at home I can take the toothbrush and charger to work and it fits neatly in my desk drawer.</li>
    <li> I have been sharing our toothbrush charger, with my wife, for several years, usually after my toothbrush had lost all its charge. I finally \\&quot;splurged\\&quot; and bought this compact version of the required charger. I&#x27;m delighted to have it since I no longer need to pester my wife, and my toothbrush is fully charged at all times.   The compact size is a very nice feature.  This was a fine buy. Why did I wait so long?</li>
    <li> For many years we have used a set of two Braun Professional electric tooth brush handles that shared one tower charger.  The original tower charger recently gave out.  While searching for a replacement on-line I found that a compact charger was also available at a lower cost.  I decided to get two of the compacts instead of replacing the tower.  The compacts work equally as well as the tower and take up less space on our counter.  Now both brush handles are always fully charged.  In addition the compact is easier to take on trips and they are especially helpful when my wife or I are away from home without the other.</li>
    <li> I destroyed the original charger by plugging into a cheap voltage converter in New Zealand.  This was the best replacement I could find for travel. It arrived on time and works fine.</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement for my original charger that came with my electric toothbrush which was misplaced on a vacation.  I took it with me on a trip. It worked twice and then stopped charging altogether.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this charger to replace my old original one. I didn&#x27;t need a new toothbrush set, just the charger and this has worked very well. No problems with it so far.</li>
    <li> Not only can I use this when I travel but I can use it as a second charger for another electric toothbrush on an everyday basis.</li>
    <li> The charger that comes bundled with the toothbrush is unnecessarily large, and annoying to travel with. This compact charger is great for its small footprint in your bag!</li>
    <li> I found myself overseas and my charger was broken during the travel.  I ordered a replacement charger it arrived in less than 10 days to my APO address excellant service and a great charger.</li>
    <li> works fine with my older Panasonic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> this thing works sometimes for me, sometimes not at all.  I give it a C- (it could be my brush handle).</li>
    <li> Why Braun doesn&#x27;t include this travel charger with all their products is a mystery, other than they want to make more money off of us. Life saver is you&#x27;re on the road.</li>
    <li> Nice and compact for my travel kit. Works exactly the same as the little &amp;#34;tower&amp;#34; that came with the toothbrush. Wish it was a full range of 100-240 like most personal appliances anymore. I was just in Germany where there was no &amp;#34;shaver outlet&amp;#34; in the hotel, and half of the time the 110V outlets don&#x27;t work anyway because someone already burned it out trying to draw too much current.</li>
    <li> Great product. Glad there is an alternative to buying another $100 toot rush set when your charger goes.</li>
    <li> Accidentally left my original charger in a hotel room for my Oral-B 8000 series toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;- Compact design&lt;br /&gt;- Works just as well as the original charger (US)&lt;br /&gt;- Build quality is just as high as the original&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s no neat way to store the cord when not in use and wrapping it around the narrow charger is messy.</li>
    <li> I specifically wrote in and asked if the item looked the same as the picture.  One of the people who answered my question said, Yes, so I bought it.  It is NOT the same as the picture.  The &amp;#34;no longer available&amp;#34; quote is confusing.  It could mean that this item is no longer available anywhere but here, but that&#x27;s not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item I got was a solid roundish disk with the charger part sticking out from the center.  So far it does charge my toothbrush, but the charge doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as my other one did.  Too early to tell really.  But right from the get-go, disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> So far it meets my expectation</li>
    <li> I ordered the replacement charger after my charger quit working while on vacation.  The new charger has worked great and saved me from having to replace the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I needed a US charger for my Braun toothbrush bought in the Middle East.  This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Hooray for Braun for making this charger much smaller, lighter and available. It revived my dying toothbrush. I thought it was the toothbrush and was willing to toss it. But I thought give it one more try. The toothbrush now works better than it has for a year!</li>
    <li> I purchased this charger after I had left the original charger in a hotel room.  It works perfectly as a replacement and was offered at a good price.</li>
    <li> Works great and takes up less space than the original charger.</li>
    <li> Good inexpensive charger.  Absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> This was literally the only one I could find. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now and it&#x27;s working perfectly and way cheaper than buying a new toothbrush</li>
    <li> This charger is made by Braun for use with Braun and Oral-B electric toothbrushes, model types 3728, 4717, 4729 and 4736.  It runs on 100-120V, 50-60hz, 2W.  It is a nice, small/compact charger that takes up very little space in your bathroom, and for travel it is idea due to it&#x27;s compact size.  Much better than those bigger, bulky charging/storage units that come with the Oral-B Professional Care series toothbrushes.  This is great to get as an extra charger.</li>
    <li> Great little device; very useful to anyone who bought or buys electric brushes two at a time.</li>
    <li> The original charger for my Braun toothbrush stopped working after 6 years.  I ordered this as a replacement.  I really like its smaller size.  I can take it with me if I go on an extended trip.</li>
    <li> Had the stock charger tower that held 4 brush heads. Needed a smaller charger for everyday use and travel. Just what i needed!</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d have to buy a whole new electric toothbrush set when my toothbrush would no longer charge, since I saw no way to put a new battery into the charger. I was very pleased to see I could get this little charger since it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying a whole new set. And, two more points that were very good surprises: I love that this small charger looks much better on the bathroom counter and that it&#x27;s perfect for traveling. I would have gotten this small charger years ago if I&#x27;d known about it.</li>
    <li> Works as it&#x27;s expected ;)</li>
    <li> Not exactly as shown in the photo, but turned out BETTER as it was actually smaller so works even better for travel.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and I received it in a very timely manner</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. no problem!</li>
    <li> How nice to buy just the charger when that&#x27;s all you need! Smooth transaction. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun 7040-132 compact charger to use while traveling.  It arrived 2 days before our last trip.  I tested it to see if it worked with my toothbrush and it did.  Two days into the trip it quit working.&lt;br /&gt;When I returned home the toothbrush did charge using the original charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reread this review while writing another review and saw that I had not updated the final status.&lt;br /&gt;The charger was returned and was eventually replaced.  The replacement works fine, but I do not leave it plugged in after the toothbrush has charged for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 years of satisfactory use the second one died during a cruise.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it several times on past cruises and at home daily.&lt;br /&gt;I think the common element in the failure of both chargers is that I went 4 or 5 days without charging the toothbrush.  I feel that the charger burned out because of the extra load.&lt;br /&gt;One or two days seem to be okay.</li>
    <li> I had an English Braun toothbrush  that I moved over with and was hoping this would charge it.&lt;br /&gt;Different voltage..the charger wasn&#x27;t powerful enough. I had to buy a whole new one here in the U.S.</li>
    <li> Normally a left-behind item during travels becomes a travail: calling around to track it down or making do without.  After leaving my o.g. charger in one of numerous potential hotels i gave up and ordered this.  Not only does it charge faster than the larger upright model, the charge lasts longer and it is much more compact, perfect for traveling.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says, is small and efficient.  It is the charger that I use, and is better than others that I have had.</li>
    <li> Braun does NOT indicate that their charger will fail after use in Europe with a 240-&gt;120 converter and that you must purchase a 220-240 V charger with european plug to recharge the tooth brush.  All of our other 120V (that aren&#x27;t also 220V) work fine with our Magellan converters.  So, this is a replacement &amp; we also purchased a 220V charger for Europe trips.  Works well on 110V.</li>
    <li> We had to get this as a replacement charger because the son took the original to college.  It works fine, even though the description and customer reviews did not mention that it would also work for our Braun model (Professional Care 1500/ 2000/ 3000, Type 3757).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, none of the chargers I researched seemed to include mention of our particular model, even though we only purchased it on Amazon a few years ago.  It was a bit frustrating, but we thought we&#x27;d take the leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, I discovered that the old charger we still had from 9 years ago for an old Braun model actually worked fine, so I could have saved us a bit of money.  So if it looks like the shape of the charger you need, it may be appropriate.</li>
    <li> HAVE NOT USED IT YET.  iTS SAME AS MY 220V ONE i UED IN BUENOS AIES FOR  YEARS.</li>
    <li> Excellent charger.  I blew the charger that came with my toothbrush when I mistakenly plugged it into a 220V current in Europe.  I thought I would have to buy a whole new toothbrush.  Was glad to find this charger which works great.</li>
    <li> Received the charger. My original one finally gave out after nearly a decade. The charger I got works and has given my Braun toothbrush additional life but it is totally different than what is shown. The one in the photo shows the same item I had had for 10 years. The one I was sent was smaller by half; a sort of round disc without a back so the toothbrush sits differently on it and is a bit less stable than the original. All in all, it saved me from spending $100+ to get a whole new set but I just wish for more truth/accuracy in the offer.</li>
    <li> We bought this since we had lost the other charger.  Boy, does it ever work perfectly and is EASY to throw in the toiletry case!!  Been working perfectly ever since!  Nice to have peace of mind that you won&#x27;t run out of power when traveling with your electric toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I love it, it works great and was just what I was looking for to travel with, it&#x27;s small and compact.</li>
    <li> I left my original charger while vacationing and immediately went to check the manufacturer&#x27;s site for a replacement. The manufacturer no longer had any chargers in stock so when I found this one through Amazon I was thrilled. I was a little skeptical since it said no longer available and looked different than my original but I purchased it anyway. I was so excited when I received the exact same charger as my original. It was as if I had ordered it new from the manufacturer - perfectly packaged and working beautifully.</li>
    <li> great charger - works just fine with my oral-b electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> Came just as expected and it works with my toothbrush!  Yeah!</li>
    <li> My original Braun charger no longer was charging and found this replacement on your website. Works great!&lt;br /&gt;As good as the original. Glad I didn&#x27;t have to throw out my 2 braun toothbrushes units, because the charger stopped working</li>
    <li> My wife tossed old one and I was at a loss...I bought this guy in order to just use the same brush and not pay for a whole new outfit.  This worked like a charm.  I like it&#x27;s simplicity as well.</li>
    <li> It is the same as the one we originally had. and it is indeed made in Germany by Braun. Great.</li>
    <li> It was what I wanted and was shipped timely</li>
    <li> Arrived beat to hell, gets very warm in use but works fine.</li>
    <li> very practical and convenient to bring when travelling</li>
    <li> It fixed a problem that I feared could not be solved without having to purchase whole new device ( electric tooth brush).</li>
    <li> Old one died and bought this one. It works well and saved some bucks. What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. No issues so far. Wish it would work at 220 VAC also - that is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5</li>
    <li> My Braun toothbrush is from Europe and I this charger fits it perfectly.  I think it is smaller than shown it the picture which is even better. Great quality item, glad I found and bought it.</li>
    <li> It works exactly as I expected!  It charges my toothbrush and I don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new unit - perfect.</li>
    <li> the product shipped was a used one or refurbished one, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> came as expected and works great, thanks</li>
    <li> Fantastic! My husband&#x27;s charger gave up after many years, this one is perfect! Does the job!</li>
