      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>that actually works REALLY great!</li>
      <li>I will get more for sure.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it even seemed to make me more oily.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many things</li>
      <li>The beauty is that you can apply the mattifier below or on top of your foundation and powder.</li>
      <li>I just love this product</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I used this in addition to primer, foundation &amp; powder and it really looks great.  </li>
      <li>Do with that information as you will. :-)</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and this product removes all oil and gives me a nice, smooth face to put make up on.</li>
      <li>I just love the Mary Kay Oil Mattifier.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to spend any more money on oil mattifiers.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>Love this product, love being shine free</li>
      <li>i use my wonderful foundation and mix my pearl powder and this little tube of awesomeness and after almost 20 hours of wear plus a nap</li>
      <li>i really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Also, the consistency is light and did not clog my pores.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Kept me oil free for about 5 hours.  </li>
      <li>I have oil skin, but when I use this product I am shine free for hours.  </li>
      <li>This will work great for moderately oily skin.</li>
      <li>DEFINITELY will buy more of this product!!</li>
      <li>If using correct amount, works perfectly with powder makeup  - Even with a small tube, lasted me about 6 months    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought a ton of different mattifiers over the years and have to say the MK brand is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>it lengthens the time the face stays oil free :D... at least for me</li>
      <li>it didnt work half as good as this mary kay!</li>
      <li>I have a fairly oily T-zone, and tried this product to cut back on the oil factory that is my nose.</li>
      <li>But with this I&#x27;m still looking good after several hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very effective, while most solutions I&#x27;ve used have only been a little bit effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product i will now try other mary kay</li>
      <li>My skin is super oily and all I can tell is that this product did not work for me at all.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have SUPER oily skin.</li>
      <li>I put this on before applying my face makeup and it keeps my skin pretty oil free.</li>
      <li>but this turned out to be exactly what I needed!  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t work well or last very long (3-4 hours at best).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this stuff—if you have problems with your face being shiny because it is dry or greasy, this will soak it right up and take the glare out of your face.</li>
      <li>I can easily fill one of the Clean &amp; Clear oil removing sheets about every 4 hours.</li>
      <li>After about 6-8 months of daily use i found it wasn&#x27;t as effective</li>
      <li>Takes a bit of time but so worth it</li>
      <li>all fresh</li>
      <li>I was well worth the cost</li>
      <li>It keeps my face fresh looking for hours.</li>
      <li>the price on amazon makes it worth it.</li>
      <li>Finally, an really good pore minimizer that keeps the shine way down.  </li>
      <li>At first I tried a lighter touch while applying, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference on my shiny nose as the day went on.</li>
      <li>I dab it on with my finger in the T zone area and then blend it by dabbing it some more with the same foundation brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My face is extremely oily, unfortunately for me I tried this out (even at night when I was home) and within an hour my face was as oily as usual. I&#x27;ll be returning.</li>
    <li> It worked the first day I used it. Kept me oil free for about 5 hours.  Then every time after that it did absolutely nothing. Sometimes it even seemed to make me more oily.</li>
    <li> Keeps me from being shiny. I am very pleased with this product. My face is not so shiny in pictures anymore.</li>
    <li> This sucks up oil on my face and leaves it shine free for hours. However since I have dark skin, you must be careful not to use too much or it will dry with white streaks. It&#x27;s still the best product that I own for an oily t-zone. I use this instead of foundation or powder.</li>
    <li> I dab this on areas on my cheeks where my pores are too large.  It definitely makes them appear smaller while not being too drying.  Also, the consistency is light and did not clog my pores.  I like to put it over my foundation, rather than on bare skin and that works best for me.  Very inexpensive compared to similar type dept store products available.  I repurchased a second tube.  First lasted quite a while.  Really no downside.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! It works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used for keeping the shine away.  It&#x27;s very effective, while most solutions I&#x27;ve used have only been a little bit effective.</li>
    <li> I honestly had no idea what this was when I received it along with some other Mary Kay products as a gift.  I&#x27;ve never been well versed in cosmetic products but this turned out to be exactly what I needed!  I tend to have very oily skin and was amazed at the result when I tried this.  I feel way less greasy by the end of the day and look better all day!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. It is much better than the Mary Kay Oil Control Lotion. Using this product will provide a powdered /no shine result especially if you blot before applying. It allowed me to go from blotting 10-12 times a day to 4-5 times instead. For someone with really oily skin this product will help reduce shine for the whole day - especially if you re-apply mid-day. After about 6-8 months of daily use i found it wasn&#x27;t as effective so a user may need to take a 1-2 month break then continue use to maintain the same level of effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I think that this stuff works about as well as any mattifier. I find it hard to find ones that don&#x27;t cause break outs and this one does not. I can tell if I don&#x27;t wear it and the price on amazon makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> My aunt sells Mary Kay and recommended that i use this product. I was skeptical because i only use MAC make up products, and at the time was using proactiv&#x27;s oil mattifier. after using the this for a week i was hooked. it soaks up the oil so much better than proactiv&#x27;s! i was shocked. when i ran out of it i had to buy clearisil oil mattifier.. it didnt work half as good as this mary kay! this is without a doubt the best oil mattifier i have ever used. and i have really oily skin! i apply it each morning to my clean face, i only use a tiny tab on my forehead and then i rub it in around my chin and nose area as well. then i apply my makeup and it lasts for the entire day without having to re-apply. if i dont use the mattifier, i have oily and shiny skin that i notice immediately. if you have oily shiny skin and are sick of carrying around oil pads all day, BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I have oil skin, but when I use this product I am shine free for hours.  Have used this stuff for years.</li>
    <li> (I am not an employee of MaryKay and was not paid to say this! I just love this product so I had to get the word out there!)    I have oily-combination skin, and had researched products that promised mattifying results for shiny T-zones. This one seemed to have the highest reviews - and although the price seemed a little much for such a small tube, I was decided to jump and try it (it was in the middle of summer and I was getting sick of always having to wipe at my face with the back of my hand or with a kleenex).    Pros:  - Works well for up to about 8 hours (in colder, dryer climates only - up to 3-4 hours in the hottest months of summer)  - Instant results of mattifying the oil - flattens out shine immediately after application  - If using correct amount, works perfectly with powder makeup  - Even with a small tube, lasted me about 6 months    Cons:  - A little expensive  - Can over-dry skin (if too much is used in one application)    How I use it:  - Wash my face with scrub cleanser  - Pat dry and apply Cetaphil cream to entire face (I&#x27;ve found this is very needed for the mattifier to avoid over-drying)  - Pat dry excess oil from cream application  - Apply MK Oil Mattifier to T-zones ONLY (very, very small amt goes a long way)  - Wait a few minutes to dry completely  - Apply powder foundation  (Later in day: as needed, touch up with more oil mattifier/powder combination)    BOTTOM LINE:  Slightly expensive product, but worth the money for the results!!! I would highly recommend this product. I&#x27;ll be buying it again in the near future.</li>
    <li> I am way too oily for this I guess. It goes on nicely, but it only last maybe 30 min on my skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 3 years now and I love it! I can&#x27;t go a single day without it. I have very oily skin an this keeps the shine away. Would recommend this product to anyone with the same problem!</li>
    <li> Works great at keeping my shine away for 6 hours. It&#x27;s lightweight and you cannot feel it at all after about 60 seconds!</li>
    <li> I love this product and it reached my home in the time frame it said it would! I will be ordering from them again!!!</li>
    <li> best matifier you can buy.  This is the best stuff around.  worth the extra money. Lasts a very long time.  I recommend this particular product</li>
    <li> I have the GREASIEST skin. Within 15 min of washing my face, my face looks like I was dunked in a frying pan. This mattifier is a life saver! It keeps my face fresh looking for hours. My only complaint is that if I apply immediately on my face after a wash it leave a powdery white residue on my face which is cute. I have tried applying moisturizer first then the mattifier and that usually helps but there are some caveats.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works to control my oily skin.  I have tried the expensive ($45) stuff and this works just as well for a fraction of the cost.  Will have to get a couple more before they disappear!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a ton of different mattifiers over the years and have to say the MK brand is by far the best.  I have dark, EXTREMELY oily skin and with this stuff, my makeup stays put for hours without looking oily.  I use the mattifying papers in the late afternoon just for touching up but no need to reapply the mattifier itself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  For me, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in the summer time.  Big fat thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin and this has become my best friend. I normally blot my face about 4-5x/day if im actually paying attention and trying to keep the serious glow down on my face. With this product I blot about 2x/day and my face does not look as oily as it normally does after the application of my make up or throughout the day. I would recommend if you have serious oil issues like me.</li>
    <li> My skin is super oily and all I can tell is that this product did not work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;It was the same thing as nothing.</li>
    <li> This is awesome and it does work. I suspect I&#x27;ll be buying it for the rest of my life. For it to really work, I have to apply a thick layer around my nostrils and smile lines (I have really oily skin). At first I tried a lighter touch while applying, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference on my shiny nose as the day went on. But when I tried a thicker layer, halfway through the day I checked myself out in the mirror and said, &amp;#34;OOH!!&amp;#34; My foundation was matte and flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought Urban Decay All Nighter spray too, hoping it would do the same thing (keep my face matte/less oily all day), and for me it does nothing (very disappointing since so many online reviewers swear by it), but Mary Kay&#x27;s Mattifier WORKS. I haven&#x27;t tried the Mattifier and UD All Nighter together yet. I&#x27;m hoping it will be the holy grail of oil prevention!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that really works on oily skin.  When my skin was oilier I did have to apply it several times a day, but now that my face has calmed down (thanks, accutane) I apply it once in the morning and I&#x27;m set for the day.  There is no color to it; it&#x27;s just an oil absorber/mattifier.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping! Thank you!</li>
    <li> MK&#x27;s oil mattifier is amazing!  You put it on after you wash your face and put lotion on (it can even go on over makeup) and it takes all the shine away!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all of the positive reviews but I didn&#x27;t have the same success with this product. I am extremely oily, moreso in the summer months. This didn&#x27;t adhere to my skin well, &amp; although I waited 10 minutes to apply oil-free foundation I had oil breaking through within the hour. Not good for the oiliest of us, unfortunately. Still seeking the perfect primer....</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Doesn&#x27;t stay matted for very long however so I have to apply it a few times throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! It didn&#x27;t make me break out. I used far less oil sheets during the day and really noticed a difference! It lasts awhile and is reasonably priced. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Tried a million matti fires, most are useless. In all fairness, my t zone is an oil slick. This, however, didn&#x27;t work for any length of time at all. Almost like using nothing. Look elsewhere, or try a setting powder.</li>
    <li> Great product i use it in my T zone because i tend to be oily there a little goes a lone way,the tube is small for the prize.</li>
    <li> I use this over my SPF moisturizer and under my make up and it helps to keep my face less shiny over the course of the day/evening.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers really seemed to like this product, which is why I purchased it but, I do not. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect at all on my skin.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and owning a lot of different Mary Kay cosmetics, I was expecting this product to be a high quality mattifier that actually worked. I was very disappointed after I used it (as directed, on a clean face with no makeup on) the effects simply did not last more than a couple of hours, and I tried reapplying it throughout the day to get rid of sheen and it simply did nothing... will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I get very shiny in the summer and greasy with humidity. This stuff helps a lot!</li>
    <li> Its a good primer, but my face tends to still get very oily later in the day due to my foundation.  I have been trying every brand under the sun.  I may have had too high of an expectation.  It&#x27;s just as good as the expensive brands, although it is very small.  However, the directions state &amp;#34;apply sparingly.&amp;#34;  It is a good alternative to the silicone based (which don&#x27;t work) or expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many things and this is the only product that has actually worked. I ended up buying 3 of them!</li>
    <li> Very nice product to reduce shines. I will get more for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better mattifiers. This doesn&#x27;t work well or last very long (3-4 hours at best). Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s the real deal for oily skin.</li>
    <li> A necessary item in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;NECESSARY....</li>
    <li> This is just awesome! I have oily skin and when I use the oil mattifier I can keep my makeup much longer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled oily skin all my life and this stuff is absolutely amazing! It keeps the oil at bay so my makeup doesn&#x27;t run south during the day. A little goes a long way so using it sparingly. I always keep this on hand because I just can&#x27;t wear makeup without this under it.</li>
    <li> Finally, an really good pore minimizer that keeps the shine way down.  I am blotting twice a day instead of every 2 hrs, and this product goes on like silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Cliniaue pore minimizer until they changed the formula and this is superior to the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have shine, buy this product.</li>
    <li> i would recomend this to anyone figtin oily skin&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product i will now try other mary kay</li>
    <li> I have such an oil slick of a face, but anything that can help is good!  I used this in addition to primer, foundation &amp; powder and it really looks great.  The tube was bigger than I was expecting and it really doesn&#x27;t take much at all so it will most likely last a long time.  For the price I will keep coming back!</li>
    <li> Love this product, love being shine free</li>
    <li> I use Mary Kay Oil mattifier daily. I have very oily skin and this product works wonders on my face. After about 3 to 4 hours of wearing it  I have to retouch it   so that I can go all day without my face looking greasy. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Product  performs very well keeping a matte appearance...works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried so far. Happy with product.</li>
    <li> This product did make a difference with my oily skin, but I&#x27;ve used better, alothough more expensive, products.  I prefer Murad Oil-Contol Mattifer, but it is much more expensive and has the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s glue.  In summary, I have found no perfect solution to the problem of controlling oily skin.:(</li>
    <li> I found this product works about the same as any other over the counter.  It was a bit more expensive and did not offer a better result.&lt;br /&gt;However, it will work on oily skin for about two hours before you need to powder.  You can not-not apply this product once makeup is applied.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that is no fun at all. It&#x27;s embarrassing how oily my forehead, nose, and chin get after a couple hours. But with this I&#x27;m still looking good after several hours. I put on all my skin care products and sunblock, wait till my skins compleatly dry, than take a pea sized amount and gently pat it into my oily zones until the skin under my fingers feels dry again. Than I wait 10 min minimum before I begin applying makeup. Takes a bit of time but so worth it</li>
    <li> I have a fairly oily T-zone, and tried this product to cut back on the oil factory that is my nose. It worked for a few days, and then my skin adjusted and kept producing just as much oil as before. Overall, not a great product for me.</li>
    <li> awesome for the t zone!!!!!! i have incredicably oily skin you can fry a chicken but thisstuff really helps control it.. i use under and over my moizterizer</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting it to be like my last one. My last one was in a white bottle and dried on contact. This one is oily and takes a few minutes to dry. Dont like it as much.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Will definitely order again. I have extremely oily skin. I put this on before applying my face makeup and it keeps my skin pretty oil free. It lasts about 5-6 hrs then my skin will take on a dewy appearance. Humid days are different, after 5-6 hours the oil comes back through. But it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> I have VERY oily skin. I can easily fill one of the Clean &amp; Clear oil removing sheets about every 4 hours. My whole face is a \\&quot;problem area,\\&quot; so I apply this product all over before applying powder foundation. This is the first mattifier I&#x27;ve tried, and while it works okay, I definitely still have to carry around oil removing sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- After applying, my face does look beautifully matte. This is especially great during humid weather when my skin seems to constantly be shiny. This might be enough for some people if your skin is not as oily as mine.&lt;br /&gt;- The tube is big enough to last you at least several months, if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-This product only helps out my skin for the first 3 hours or so. After that, I&#x27;m back on my schedule of using the oil removing sheets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this stuff—if you have problems with your face being shiny because it is dry or greasy, this will soak it right up and take the glare out of your face.</li>
    <li> Great product. This lotion visibly reduces the shine I get after a few hours of wearing make up. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> It only lasted maybe two hours before I was blotting my fact with a VIVA paper towel.  Maybe I&#x27;ll find some other miracle out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying [[ASIN:B00343Z5DC Dr. Brandt Skincare pores no more(R) anti-aging mattifying lotion 1.7-Ounces]] only to discover that it made my face even oilier, I decided to try the Mary Kay Oil Mattifier again.  I couldn&#x27;t find it after going through every possible place it could be, I gave up and ordered another from Amazon.  I have used it again somewhat successfully - two hours - and that&#x27;s GREAT for me.  I just have to remember to keep blotting with my VIVA paper towels.  I&#x27;m not going to spend any more money on oil mattifiers.  I use witch hazel every day to help shrink the pores after cleansing with my $200 Clarisonic Skin Care System.  I may try white vinegar.  I have discovered from Web MD that another user uses it to cleanse ears with Q-tips.  I&#x27;ve tried that and it works, so why not try it on my face.</li>
    <li> does what it is said to do.&lt;br /&gt;after u av applied ur makeup and the T-zones start getting shine just dab a little on ur T-zone and u r looking all fresh again.&lt;br /&gt;its not heavy</li>
    <li> It works as well as can be expected. I was looking for a colorless, natural looking mattifier and this works well. One word of advice though. If you have super oily skin, as I do, this will only work temporarily. I have the type of skin that, after taking as much oil off of my face as possible without completely drying it out, it&#x27;s back to its extremely reflective state fifteen minutes later. I&#x27;ve found that this product, when used in conjunction with a few others, keeps my face from being too shiny for about the and a half to four hours. Much better than other products I&#x27;ve tried. Do with that information as you will. :-)</li>
    <li> This works great. Only need a very small amount. Can even put on after your foundation.  Perfect for oily skin or combination skin.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this Mary Kay Oil Mattifier. I was tired of using expensive make-up, and looking like I had washed my face with baby oil, having to constantly re-touch it up by blotting away the shine. I was looking for something that went well with liquid foundation. I would apply Mary Kay on a clean face, give it a few second to dry then apply my make-up. The application is very smooth, enhances my make-up and gives a flawless look. Pores shrink, shine gone. Try Mary Kay Oil Mattifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuff Cookie</li>
    <li> I have almost used up all my product. It is a good base for my T zone if I think I might get shiny during the day and it also is a good refresher if I already have worn my makeup all day and notice some shine. The beauty is that you can apply the mattifier below or on top of your foundation and powder. I usually only apply overtop my makeup if I&#x27;ve already had my makeup on for several hours, like after work before going on a date for the night.</li>
    <li> This is the best for oily skin! Highly recommended!  Helps keep makeup looking flawless and in place! A must buy</li>
    <li> I love this mattifier!! I&#x27;ve bought it 3 times. It goes on smooth. It&#x27;s not cakey like other mattifiers, and it works for several hours. My skin is very oily. And this does the job for me of getting rid of excess oil under makeup or without makeup.</li>
    <li> I have very oily face... that&#x27;s why i purchased this product and honestly i didn&#x27;t see any improvement by wearing it. once you apply it your skin feels softer but no mattifying effect! at least for me</li>
    <li> I have tried all types of oil control products. Some were very expensive. This product is hands&lt;br /&gt;down the best!  I teach all day in a non air conditioned room and this kept my face \\&quot;t-zone\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;nice and non oily-looking. It works all day.</li>
    <li> I have SUPER oily skin. If i put anything on my FACE the oil just POURS out.. i used many kind of things to control my oil leak.. this actually does the WORK!! thank God! because my face is oily.. it doesn&#x27;t work as long as it would but still does! so if your face isn&#x27;t as oily as mine DEF buy it! *TIPS* if you think ur face is oily as mine one way that i&#x27;ve been doing with this is wash face-&gt; moisturize-&gt; Mary Kay oil mattifier on problem areas-&gt; face primer-&gt; bb cream/ foundation / whatever you do on ur face XD. that actually works REALLY great! it lengthens the time the face stays oil free :D... at least for me</li>
    <li> My skin is very oily and this Mattifier is wonderful.  I have used oil blot papers, powder, primers and the shine and oil always comes back.  I put the oil mattifier on after my moisturizer and I didn&#x27;t have to use anything else all day long.  I will definately purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products in the past but this one is the only one that actually works well. It is expensive for what you get but this bottle will probably last 4-6 months depending on how often you re-apply during the day.  I was well worth the cost</li>
    <li> perfect product. the service was great too! DEFINITELY will buy more of this product!!</li>
    <li> I just love the Mary Kay Oil Mattifier.</li>
    <li> Worked ok but my freakishly oily skin adapted to it quickly and the shine control didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hope. Check out Skindinavia No Shine for about the same price with better shine control.</li>
    <li> this product works very well i really enjoy it. i use my wonderful foundation and mix my pearl powder and this little tube of awesomeness and after almost 20 hours of wear plus a nap lol my face os basically oil free !!</li>
    <li> I put this on AFTER i apply my foundation. Works like a charm. I dab it on with my finger in the T zone area and then blend it by dabbing it some more with the same foundation brush. I do this because i was cast as an extra on a tv series and this is how the makeup artist applied it to my skin after the foundation. However, Mary Kay was not the brand she used and she said I couldn&#x27;t buy what she used in stores :(. Mary Kay brand works great for me though.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it every day and I actually just ran out :( I definitely will be purchasing another one. I put this on right before I put my makeup on and it works very well. I have oily skin and this product removes all oil and gives me a nice, smooth face to put make up on.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t soak up the oil for long, but I have extremely oily skin. This will work great for moderately oily skin.</li>
