<ol>
    <li> I have used this scalp treatment serum several times and every time I use it my scalp itches and itches.  I believe it is the ingredients and I am probably allergic to something this product contains.  Every product that states it is \\&quot;100% Natural\\&quot; is not allergy free/reaction free.</li>
    <li> I love it for my hair i don&#x27;t use anything but Deity products.</li>
    <li> I found this product locally over the weekend.  Tried it and by the next day, it already feel stronger in addition to using the shampoo.  Since I am new to these products, I will keeping mentioning my progress as I continue to see results.</li>
    <li> Smells great works well</li>
    <li> the best for my hair!!!!!! The only thing that make my hair look beautiful in this nature state love this product</li>
    <li> It is good for hair growth.</li>
    <li> Still using product. I haven&#x27;t notice any change in my hair.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite and the best nutrient dense hair food. .</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but it smells soooooooooo good I can&#x27;t wait to use. I read Amazon reviews and it helped with my drcidiin.</li>
    <li> this product works great i i will be  ordering this product again i need to order for a friend thanks</li>
    <li> I have just purchased this product as I have used Deity America hair colour treatment and shampoo before. Surprisingly, I could not get this greasy &#x27;scalp treatment for hair loss&#x27; out of my hair. The instructions are not very clear and so I shampooed my hair 10 times but the oily treatment still remains in my hair.  As it is supposed to improve your hair growth and prevent hair falling out  - during the 10 shampoo washes I lost a significant amount of hair trying to wash the greasy serum off. I hope I don&#x27;t have to use bleach to remove the product. I do not recommend this particular product to anyone unless they want to wear a wig to cover their greasy hair.</li>
    <li> There was a product I once used and it is no longer available. I happened on this product at a health food store, until they no longer carried it. I then search the internet and came across this seller on Amazon.com. I continue to buy this product because it really helps me with my thinning in the scalp. Sometimes its as if I&#x27;m losing hair, but when I use this, it not only grows, but it fills in what I&#x27;d call possible bald spots. Can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, but works for me! I could see the difference when I ran out and hadn&#x27;t used it for about 2mths.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for some months and am awaiting better results. I will continue to use, along with the shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product and I am receiving the result I thought I would get from using the product.</li>
    <li> Didnt notice that this made my hair grow any faster.  Did leave my scalp feeling gummy, and I didnt like that.</li>
    <li> Greasy product.  Only used once.</li>
    <li> hasnt been long enough to tell if its really working but i can tell you it really soothes the scalp.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that made  my daughter&#x27;s hair grow.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment since October 2014 and it has been amazing. Recently, I added the tonic hair growth restorer, which I use on my temples and nape area. My hair was originally brittle and constantly breaking. After the first shampooing and conditioning my hair stopped breaking and has been growing ever since. I have become a walking advertisement for these products.</li>
