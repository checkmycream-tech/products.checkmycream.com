      <li>This will work nicely for me and my wife.</li>
      <li>It was a good choice, but could be better.  </li>
      <li>When not in use, it is out of the way but still looks nice on my wall.</li>
      <li>So, it ended up looking like something from a used junk store, not suited to be in out nice .  </li>
      <li>It was very easy to install and the screws and anchors were included.</li>

      <li>The mirror itself does swivel quite easy!</li>
      <li>When I first purchased this item, I thought it was great.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon, I am one happy customer.</li>
      <li>I could use the 7x side for perfect make-up and the pull-out and swivel feature to see the back of my hair.</li>
      <li>so you will have to be sure to anchor it well to whatever wall space you use.  </li>
      <li>Love the mirror.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making this available, and in a choice of colors too!  </li>
      <li>I used some machine oil on each of the joints, I have played it like a accordion many times to see If it would loosen up</li>
      <li>It looks very nice and it is also very functional.</li>
      <li>I have limited space in the bathroom so this mirror worked out perfectly.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t hung it up yet but do know I will need molly bolts to make sure it is secure.</li>
      <li>Easy to install as well.</li>
      <li>I would tell them to look in the mirror to make sure their faces are clean.  </li>
      <li>This was an easy install.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I was looking for, and looks nice in my bathroom, too.  </li>
      <li>once it made it to us it worked out just fine.</li>
      <li>It has been fine in terms of not accordioning out when I wasn&#x27;t telling it to so</li>
      <li>nice product--works very well and easy to install.</li>
      <li>IMPORTANT ITEM TO HAVE BEFORE YOU STEP OUT OF THE HOUSE.</li>
      <li>Although the brass color is not my favorite, it matches the other fixtures in the bathroom, and otherwise looks great.</li>
      <li>It attaches easily to the wall and telescopes adequately, so that you can see all sides of your head.</li>
      <li>The product itself is perfect for my small space.  </li>
      <li>The mirror is beautiful and very big compared to the tiny mirror she was using and most of all I wanted something hands free!</li>
      <li>I am quite handy and was able to make a replacement part out of solid brass rod.  </li>
      <li>Overall a well made lovely mirror!</li>
      <li>It looks great mounted beside my regular bathroom mirror and swings over to the middle easily.  </li>
      <li>Great little mirror that didn&#x27;t take up any counter space.</li>
      <li>This one was quickly sent out, price was great over local big boxes, and it arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>From now on I check here first for everything.  </li>
      <li>This mirror is exactly what I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.  </li>
      <li>I was amazed firstly to find this product for sale at all because it was the exact thing I was looking for</li>
      <li>I found this one and was able to screw it on my current mounting.</li>
      <li>I have had numerous similar models, but the quality of this one, including the finish, is superior.</li>
      <li>It did take more time than expected to get it shipped, but</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I bought this mirror a few months ago and simply love it.</li>
      <li>Of course I didn&#x27;t realize all of this until I installed the mirror, so now I guess will have to live with it even though it is not the mirror Amazon advertised for $49.99.</li>
      <li>Then, one of the rivets that are at the joint of the scissors action broke.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for my 90 year old mother in law that is living with my wife and myself.</li>
      <li>PLACE IT UNDER A NATURAL LITE SOURCE OR LAMP</li>
      <li>The swivel-type mirrors didn&#x27;t extend far enough to see the back of my hair on both sides for styling.  </li>
      <li>Not long after, two more rivets failed.</li>

    <li> I have been looking for a mirror to put on the wall of my small bathroom for a long time. None of the stores I went to had just what I needed. Then I looked in Amazon and there it was. Within days the mirror arrived. It took about 5 minutes to install and is perfect for my needs. When not in use, it is out of the way but still looks nice on my wall. Thanks Amazon, I am one happy customer.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. It looks very nice and it is also very functional. I have bough two and I am going to buy another one.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this item, I thought it was great. However, with the test of time, it has become a piece of junk. Of course, I was past the time for returning it and the warrany had expired.  First the threads on the base of the mirror stripped out. I am quite handy and was able to make a replacement part out of solid brass rod.  Then, one of the rivets that are at the joint of the scissors action broke.  I ended up using a brass rivet to replace it, but it didn&#x27;t match the others. Not long after, two more rivets failed. The brass frame around the mirrorbegan to discolor. So, it ended up looking like something from a used junk store, not suited to be in out nice .  Needless to say, the mirror \\&quot;lives with the fish.\\&quot;  A piece of junk.</li>
    <li> This is a super mirror if you are like me and blind without your glasses (and tired of sitting in the sink to get close enough to apply make-up).  It looks great mounted beside my regular bathroom mirror and swings over to the middle easily.  The thing to know when deciding the height of your drywall fasteners (I used the biggest white plastic corkscrew type from Home Depot) is that when the mirror is extended out all the way, it ends up being a couple inches lower than when it is compressed.  (As it moves toward you, it slides DOWN the shaft.)     I learned this the hard way and have some big ugly holes in my wall to show for it after I re-installed it the next day.  I hope this makes sense and is helpful to others.  The mirror seems a bit flimsy when extended (I think the shaft it is on could be alot sturdier to hold the weight of the mirror) which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> IMPORTANT ITEM TO HAVE BEFORE YOU STEP OUT OF THE HOUSE. PLACE IT UNDER A NATURAL LITE SOURCE OR LAMP AND YOU ARE SET TO APPLY MAKEUP OR PLUCK YOUR EYEBROWS.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d mirror and was impressed with the quality and how large it is. Magnification side of mirror does not distort.  I haven&#x27;t hung it up yet but do know I will need molly bolts to make sure it is secure. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. It was very easy to install and the screws and anchors were included. It feels sturdy even when fully extended. Although the brass color is not my favorite, it matches the other fixtures in the bathroom, and otherwise looks great. No complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I just mounted in it the bathroom. This will work nicely for me and my wife. This was an easy install.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. Love the mirror.  Already mounted in bathroom and am using daily.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> excellent,so good i purchased two</li>
    <li> I use it everyday for my hair.  So I can see the back of my head.  My daughter uses it also.</li>
    <li> I was amazed firstly to find this product for sale at all because it was the exact thing I was looking for and it was great to find it.  The product itself is perfect for my small space.  It is rather heavy so you will have to be sure to anchor it well to whatever wall space you use.  It has been fine in terms of not accordioning out when I wasn&#x27;t telling it to so not sure what the other reviewer was experiencing.  Overall a well made lovely mirror!</li>
    <li> very nice quality, sturdy, easy to install, depending on what you will use this for, you might want a lighted one - I will be using it to cut my hair, but for makeup, get a lighted one</li>
    <li> My wife likes her replacement mirror.  It did take more time than expected to get it shipped, but once it made it to us it worked out just fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror a few months ago and simply love it. It is much sturdier built than past ones I have had. It attaches easily to the wall and telescopes adequately, so that you can see all sides of your head. I have had numerous similar models, but the quality of this one, including the finish, is superior. I highly recommend it. No negatives.</li>
    <li> I would like to give this mirror five stars but the only complaint was that it is very hard to extend the mirror and push it back into place. I purchased this for my 90 year old mother in law that is living with my wife and myself. She has a security pole next to her chair so I fastened it to the pole. She is not a frail person but couldn&#x27;t extend this mirror. I used some machine oil on each of the joints, I have played it like a accordion many times to see If it would loosen up but after two weeks it is still very hard to extend and retract it. Maybe I just happen to get one that is slightly bent or?? The mirror is beautiful and very big compared to the tiny mirror she was using and most of all I wanted something hands free! The mirror itself does swivel quite easy!</li>
    <li> I have had this type of mirror for years. I accidently broke the mirror. I found this one and was able to screw it on my current mounting. It was just what I needed to replace the one I broke. I was so happy with it, I am thinking of ordering another, just to have a backup. Goldtone extension mirrors are hard to find.</li>
    <li> This mirror makes it easier for my children to see themselves upclose.  I would tell them to look in the mirror to make sure their faces are clean.  This is a help.</li>
    <li> I like the mirror. It seems some what fragile. I would have liked one side to have a greater magnification, perhaps 10X.&lt;br /&gt;I also wish it could extend farther from the wall. It was a good choice, but could be better.  Tom Hurley</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I was looking for, and looks nice in my bathroom, too.  The swivel-type mirrors didn&#x27;t extend far enough to see the back of my hair on both sides for styling.  This works great!</li>
    <li> In my little teeny, tiny bathroom with no room on the non-existent vanity, this mirror was a life saver. I could use the 7x side for perfect make-up and the pull-out and swivel feature to see the back of my hair. Great little mirror that didn&#x27;t take up any counter space.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.  From now on I check here first for everything.  Thank you for making this available, and in a choice of colors too!  I love it. &lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have a small space in which to put my makeup on and always had to get a TV tray to set my makeup mirror on.  Now I have this attached to shelving where I sit and have my makeup. No more setting up the tray and taking it down every day!  It is so handy!!!  Just perfect and it expands out plenty to do makeup and hair and just push it back in when finished.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Easy to install, looks great.  Works well.  I have limited space in the bathroom so this mirror worked out perfectly.</li>
    <li> Mother-in-law wanted a wall mirror in brass.  This one was quickly sent out, price was great over local big boxes, and it arrived quickly.  She likes it and says it works great. Easy to install as well.</li>
    <li> nice product--works very well and easy to install.</li>
    <li> This is just the trick for seeing how you are styling the back of your head. Extension gives plenty of room.</li>
    <li> The mirror is well made and works as it should, there is no sagging when fully extended and it stays in place; however it is not 7x magnification, it is only 4x.  It also extends only 22&amp;#34; from the wall and that&#x27;s if I pull hard on it.  Of course I didn&#x27;t realize all of this until I installed the mirror, so now I guess will have to live with it even though it is not the mirror Amazon advertised for $49.99.</li>
