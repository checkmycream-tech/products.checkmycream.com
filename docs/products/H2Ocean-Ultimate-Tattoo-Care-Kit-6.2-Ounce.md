      <li>The moisturizing foam doesn&#x27;t have the best smell in the world, but it works very well at keeping your tattoo moisturized and helps seal in the ink.</li>

      <li>, also it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first used H2Oceans saline when I had my ears guaged and was very pleased. I have recently tested their tattoo aftercare kit and I must say it works well. The soap is mild and effective even though this kit doesn&#x27;t give you much of it. However one/two pumps is enough to clean. The moisturizer is great, a little goes a LONG way when put on gently (or rough when the scabs fall off the tattoo). The Ocean foam is awesome, a thin layer is all that is needed to really add that extra lock in. As a heads up though, users will experience a slight &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation when applying the ocean foam to new tattoos (that is normal). If you&#x27;re going to invest money into getting a good tattoo, then invest in a good aftercare product that helps it stay looking good. My tattoo has healed and looks great thanks to this company&#x27;s product. Thank you H2Ocean!.....and Amazon for a great deal :)</li>
    <li> If you get any tatts with color this is a MUST have!! H2Ocean helps lock in the brightness of the colors that you see from the first day and for years to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for both my half-sleeve tattoos. Easy to use and lasts and long time. Great product. Use this for 2-3 weeks until its healed then switch to the scent free Lubriderm lotion for as long as you wish to use it.&lt;br /&gt;This is different from the white label H2Ocean because the white label one is petro based, not water based.</li>
    <li> Tattoo didn&#x27;t get infected, but there was irritation around tattoo. Switched to Neosporin Antibiotic and Aveeno moisturizing lotion and had better luck with that conbination.</li>
    <li> I have used H2Ocean exclusively on two sleeves over the last 2 years. After years of using petroleum based products I was bothered by the heavy scabbing and small whiteheads I always had during my tattoo healing time. This product has eliminated both those issues for me. The green soap is gentle and I have never had any issues with the irritation that I have experienced with other cleansers. The cream is very comfortable and absorbs well and the foam is the best post tattoo product I have ever used. it is so comfortable and light on the skin but adds a good amount of necessary moisture. My skin never feels greasy and I get only very light scabbing and no whiteheads during my healing. For my skin this has proven to be the best product.</li>
    <li> The moisturizing creme keeps your tattoo soft and moist all day without scabbing or.drying out... The cleanser is wonderful for cleaning the tattoo... And everything is easy to use and work great.</li>
    <li> I love the way that H2ocean heals my tattoos.  I would suggest this to anybody who wants an incredible looking tattoo that heals very quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this being somewhat skeptical about whether not it would actually work and let me tell you, IT IS FREAKIN AWESOME!! I got a large piece of my side and was told it would take about 2 weeks to heal, it is the end of week 1 and it is almost done healing, I can&#x27;t believe!! So easy to use and very effective in making the process less annoying or irritating, anytime I had an itch or piece that would appear to be peeling I used the foam and it working like a charm to reseal the tattoo, allowing me to more easily move around and not worry about the tattoo!! I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an easy solution to healing your new tattoo!!</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff i have a tone of tats all over im covered like the subway this is the best stuff to get for your tat works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different things from A+D ointment to various scented/unscented lotions. This is the only thing that I can use relatively pain-free, and keeps my ink looking vibrant. It also does quite a good job keeping the ink from scabbing. Quality product.</li>
    <li> My daughter receieved her first tattoo and was given a sample of H2ocean from someone with several tattoos. As soon as she tried it you can see the difference. It took the redness around the area away and the tattoo healed in only a couple of days. Non greasy, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the process of getting a very large dragon tattoo done (my first and only) and the outline took about 2 weeks to completely heal.  I&#x27;d heard about H2Ocean and decided that I&#x27;d give it a try when I went back for color, and less than a week after I got the color, it was completely healed.  Well worth the money, and the only thing I&#x27;ll use from here on out.  Would be really great if the kit came in a larger size because I&#x27;ve still got a ways to go.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re honestly better off using Aquaphor and Eucerine. Those are both water based products and don&#x27;t dry up nearly as quickly as H2Ocean products.</li>
    <li> Pleased with products... Bottles are small but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot especially if your tattoos are small or medium sized.  A little goes a long way.  Moisturizer worked particularly well.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great tattoo care stuff, best in the business</li>
    <li> I have multiple tattoos and never used anything other than unscented soap and A&amp;D ointment. It always made a mess! This system is great! The soap is very soothing and with it being a foam pump its much easier to use. The lotion kept my tattoo moist but not suffocated like ointment does. The moisturizing foam is also really nice and I feel like it helped heal my tattoo with a lot more vibrant color than any other I&#x27;ve had. I have suggested it to other friends and suggest it to anyone else getting tatted up soon :)</li>
    <li> Had my tattoo done six days ago and am using this kit since day one. So far the tattoo is healing very well and looks better than the other ones when healing. The biggest negative is the price... but if you spend $200 or more for a tattoo, what&#x27;s another $30?&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try... and follow the directions...</li>
    <li> Good product, a little pricey in my view but it does do a good job keeping skin moist and itch free</li>
    <li> This kit worked very well along with the extreme care h2ocean that I normally use, I&#x27;m not sure but the foam that this kit came with really locked in the ink. It felt a bit weird at first, kind of a warming sensation but this stuff worked great on my sleeve and I&#x27;ll defiantly be buying this stuff again.</li>
    <li> The product is a bit expensive, but having a solid anti-bacterial soap to wash the tattoo with is key. The cream is nice and thick to and will keep your tattoo moisturized. It&#x27;s also pleasant smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had almost no scabbing using this for after one day of A&amp;D ointment. I switched to regular lubriderm after 3 days with the HS2Ocean.</li>
    <li> I feel the moisturizing foam dries my skin out. Sticking with tattoo goo.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Nothing special. I like Lubriderm the best. It does come with some good soap for ur Tat though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never get another tattoo until I have H2Ocean. This kit is very convenient as it has everything you need to care for your tattoo. The moisturizing foam doesn&#x27;t have the best smell in the world, but it works very well at keeping your tattoo moisturized and helps seal in the ink.</li>
    <li> Helped me heal and got me a compliment from my tattoo artist about how I had kept up with it post session :3</li>
    <li> My skin broke out. White heads surrounding my ink. Could be a mixture of product irritation and irritation from the dry shave. I tried this after Tattoo Goo irritated me. Soap and lotion for me now.</li>
    <li> Healed my tattoo perfect</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product.. The results are worth the price. My tattoo was closed within the first 24 hours and the scabbing process was complete within one week; completely healed in two weeks. I would get this product the next time I get another tattoo.. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast everything healed!</li>
    <li> There really is nothing much to say about this product. It basically speaks for itself and it is very effective. I used it on my first tattoo and I am impressed on how it sped up my healing and kept my new tat moisturized. The instructions that came with the kit are easy to follow and the use of the product is easy and not messy. I will definitely buy another set when I get a new tat and would recommend it to anybody looking for a great aftercare kit for their fresh ink.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It great for tattoos. I&#x27;m definitely going to purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This is only my secondish tattoo I say secondish because I got a cancer ribbon for my papa last year just a very small one that I wanted to add to later. That tattoo I washed regularly and used tattoo goo on after over a week it still was not doing all that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Thrusday I got the second phase of the tattoo a large fully colored lotus blossom surrounding the small cancer ribbon. I used tatoo goo the first day only because this was not here yet.  But have used this every day since and after less then 4 days it is almost completely healed. That&#x27;s like magic considering there was soo much more work done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely sold on this product and will not be without it for any other work I have done or any that anyone else I know has done. For 30 bucks to be able to wear real clothes over your brandnew tattoo without worrying about greasy nastey stuff ruining them it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also planning on continueing with the ink lock and the lotion they give after this kit is done. The bottles look tiny but a little goes a long way I don&#x27;t even think I have used 15% of the bottles washing and mosturizing my tattoo roughly 5 times a day since Friday afternoon and my tattoo is maybe around the size of a bagel or a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Idk why but all these name brand tattoo after care creams dont do shit for me. Tattoo goo made my sleeve look darker then it should be, and this one turned my whole tattoo turn into one big scab. The foam needs to put on like every hour(which i didnt do because that just over moisturizes your tattoo which sucks out the ink, but i still had to put it on like 6 times a day which is double what i do with a&amp;d), and when it dries it leave this white powdery shit on me. And the cream doesnt do much of anything either, i only use it when i needed to carry it around because my curel is to big to carry with me. The only thing i like is the soap, its actaully really good, which is why im giving this 2 stars instead of one. Now i got this tattoo that looked awesome before i used this shit, but since i decided to try out a new product it looks like shit, got all scabbed up, and now its covered with white spots, and worst of all i cant even touch it up because i did it in another state, so im basically screwed with it for the rest of my life. So what did i learn, if you&#x27;re guna try out a new product, dont get your tat at another state, that was a dumb move, and now i have to stare at the mistake for the rest of my life. This shit may work for alot people, but im sticking to a&amp;d, thats the only thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Started using it a few months back when I began work on my leg sleeve and it works awesome. The soap is really gentle on the fresh tattoo and after the first wash it feels great, unlike when you use regular hand soap. The lotion does not leave a disgusting sticky mess like A&amp;D does and it is all natural so it allows the skin to breathe while it is healing. The ocean foam is great because it helps moisturize even more when you begin using it on the second day. Everything together helps speed up the healing process significantly and keeps most of the ink in and your tattoo looking sweet. Your tattoo also seems to peel a lot less when using this which is awesome. Now if only it could stop the itching XD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is an amazing kit and it definitely worth 20-30 that you pay for it. It lasts quite a while as well so you are only buying one maybe every month to two months.</li>
    <li> I paid for 3 day shipping and received it on time. All 3 aftercare product are in box, only problem is that the skin moisturizing cream seal was more then halfway peeled off as if it&#x27;s been opened and used already.</li>
    <li> Bought this kit before I ever got my tattoo. But as soon as I got my first tattoo and asked my artist that it was OK to use. I didn&#x27;t waste no time. I read so many reviews and read all tips and did my homework.  The direction is very simple, and easy to follow.  Yes! Its pricey, but I spent $340 on my tattoo. So I want to make sure to get a full care on my new found Art.  If you can afford a tattoo, well of course, why bother for the price. My tattoo still looks fresh and healthy, like I got it yesterday. Its been a month now. I recomend this product, and will buy again and again..</li>
    <li> They claim their product &amp;#34;locks in the ink&amp;#34;. I doubt it. I use aquaphor the first couple of days and then unscented lotion after that. Just wash with dial soap. This stuff is kind of a gimmick.</li>
    <li> The worst. Couldn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturize even if it came with a fire hose. Skin would crack during the healing phase. Should of just stuck with a&amp;d and aveeno.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on a whim and found that it is no where near as food as the tattoo goo product. The lotion is ok, but very oily.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and he loved it its a great product everyone should definitely buy this :-)</li>
    <li> The pictures of my tattoo are on the product page.  I did a TON of research on aftercare and it seems that there&#x27;s just as much contradiction between the professionals as there is with the amateurs.  I had a special a&amp;d ointment applied and saran wrapped for 3 hours until I got home.  I immediately used the foam soap to wash off the ointment and then dried it by dabbing a soft towel on it to soak up the water AND MOISTURE which avoids the scabbing.  Then I used the Salve \\&quot;instructions are in the box and are very easy to follow\\&quot; for the first 2 days and then started the ocean foam.  I stopped oozing after a day and a half.  I&#x27;ve heard tons of stories about how other peoples tattoos healed and I believe this product accelerated the time and took GREAT care of my tattoo.  I know it&#x27;s 30 dollars but the freaking tattoo lasts the rest of your life so don&#x27;t be a cheap ass and screw up your tattoo so it ends up looking cheap and crappy. *** I used this product for the initial healing phase of my tattoo.  Such as the first week.  After that, save money and use alcohol and fragrance free soap and hand lotion.  I use that in conjunction with the tattoo aftercare kit and I still have some left over to begin finishing my half sleeve with.  I ordered a second kit because I believe I&#x27;ll run out in the healing process of getting my second outline filled in.</li>
    <li> I originally bought one kit, and then just started buying the 2oz moisturizing cream. and the Aquatat Moisturizer, 1.75 oz  That stuff is awesome! The foam wash will last about 2-4 washes depending on the size of your new ink. and the other stuff is okay. But if you are here either because you are new to tattoo healing or you are looking to change, buy the two I listed. The Aquatat can replace your aquaphor/AD and the cream can replace lotion. I actually mix them tbh, 2 parts Cream one part aquatat. That way my leg isn&#x27;t all goopy feeling, but instead feels super soft and stays well protected. I&#x27;m 16 hours into a 36 hour piece and this stuff is working great.</li>
    <li> it was recommended to me by a tattoo artist friend and cant complain, the healing process of my tattoo was excellent. no wonder why many big name artist cosign it.</li>
    <li> This aftercare kit is absolutely wonderful!! My tattoo healed very quickly and I had no issues with it all. It still looks perfect. I definitely plan on buying another kit when I get my next tattoo.</li>
    <li> I have two tattoos and didn&#x27;t know about this stuff for my first one. I was told to use  triple antibiotic ointment, so I did, but that is a definite no-no! I used this kit for my second tattoo and could not believe the difference in the healing process. The scabbing and healing process was basically unnoticable. I also didn&#x27;t have any itching. I feel like my second tattoo looks much healthier because the immediate aftercare was so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product while look for H2Ocean spray for piercings. That stuff works miracles on my piercings so I figured I would give their tattoo kit a try. I was definitely not disappointed and you won&#x27;t be either!</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff. Tattoos heal faster, it seems. The scabbing stage is quicker, and there seems to less itching. I&#x27;m heavily tattooed and have used just about everything. This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used and will get this kit before every tattoo session.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a recommendation from my artist. I used it as the instructions that come with it tell you to and I ended up with really bad scabs all over the tattoo. This is my fourth tattoo by this artist and far from the most extensive work I&#x27;ve had done. I&#x27;ve NEVER had a problem with scabs before. I usually use good ol&#x27; A&amp;D and lubriderm lotion. I know plenty of people say sometimes that happens, but it&#x27;s too much of a coincidence that this is the first time I use the product and all of a sudden I have problems. I would steer way clear of this product and just stick to the basics.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect kit for a tattoo I got on my lower back.  Not only did this help with the healing process, but a year later the tattoo color is still nice and this was ink that was done by the same artist as some of my other tattoos.  I have several tattoos and this is the first one I tried the H2Ocean on.  There was no damaging scabbing and the tattoo healed beautifully.  All the hard work of my artist did not get damaged and my skin was well taken care of because of this product.  The kit was the perfect size for the two week healing time and I even had some left to share with a friend who got some new ink so he could try it before he purchased.  He reported that even the tattoo he used this on looks better than previous ones that he used other products on.</li>
    <li> My tattoos are in perfect shape thanks to this. I followed the steps that came with the kit and my tattoo is smooth and radiant.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just okay. Its not the worst and its not the best. I actually don&#x27;t even spend all kinds of money using all these tattoo healing lotions anymore, regular lotion works just fine.</li>
    <li> Stick with regular dial soap and unscented lotion. This stuff made me break out so bad and made the tattoo look disgusting. The man who did my tattoo yelled at me for using this instead of following his instructions.</li>
    <li> These products made me itch more rather than soothe this itching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products on my tattoos and this is by far the best so far. Years ago I did the A&amp;D ointment when that was the thing, Vaseline, tattoo goo and the best until now was aquaphor, but this kit is just great. Love the size of the bottles because I can throw the foam in my makeup bag and have it with me all the time. It&#x27;s kept my older tattoos looking fresh and I&#x27;ve never had such quick healing with any other &amp;#34;soap.&amp;#34; Will definitely keep on hand for all future tattoos (ordered in advance and with prime shipping it arrived the day before my appointment, so I used it from day one). The only other product you need is a sunscreen, but don&#x27;t waste your money on the ones marketed for tattoos, it&#x27;s the same stuff as coppertone and the like. The sun does more damage to your tats than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I am an Esthetician (skin care specialist) and esthetics instructor and the ingredients they use are great. Noncomedogenic (won&#x27;t cause comedos, aka blackheads) non irritating, protective, gentle, and hydrating. I am very particular about the things I put on my skin and I had no problems using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your tats clean, follow your tattoo artists instructions to the letter, and DON&#x27;T PICK!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for color and black tattoos. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a hard time finding products for their skin.</li>
    <li> awesome product plain and simple heals better than anything I&#x27;ve used and does not ruin your clothes or tattoo awesome product</li>
    <li> First things first, the photo that you see above is wrong. The kit comes with three different items, a cleaning foam, a moisturizing cream and another foam that you put on after the second day.    Most tattoo shops recommend A&amp;D Ointment, which I used on my first tattoo. A while ago, I got a scrape (not on my tattoo) and I figured that I would use some A&amp;D on it since it supposedly helped to heal my tattoo. After a few days, nothing really seemed to change, I used some Bacitracin and it healed in a day. (I am not saying that you should use Bacitracin on your tattoo!) Considering that A&amp;D didn&#x27;t really help me heal very much, I went looking for other products and found this...    The first day you get your tattoo you are supposed to use the foam and the cream. The instructions don&#x27;t make the most sense to me, but I&#x27;m guessing the foam is to clean it and the cream moisturizes. Again, it doesn&#x27;t really say that the cream also helps heal your tattoo, but after using it I think it does it (and does it well).     I&#x27;m only two days into using the kit, but it seems to be working. The pain has gone down a ton (I had a 1/2 sleeve outlined with some of the background shaded) and I am not seeing any flaking of the ink at all. By the second day, the tattoo stopped &#x27;leaking&#x27; ink. Everything seems to be scabbing up nicely.    It would appear that this kit really is helping things along. I will add more down the line, but I am very pleased with the kit.</li>
    <li> if you have recently gotten a new tat this care kit is a must have.. this kit is all you need for after care.</li>
    <li> if you want your tattoo to heal in half the time get this stuff.. the foam is good to use on a very fresh tattoo, and the cream a few days later when its gets flakey... its worth the extra money</li>
    <li> I have had three tattoos done, and for two of them I have used this set to heal. The soap I only thought was ok (basically any mild, hand washing-type liquid soap will work), but I love the cream! It moisturizes without suffocating. The foam is good for taking with you if/when you go places where applying the cream would be impractical, or for a few days after your session. I actually went to my tattoo artist today for a touch-up, and he commented that my last piece of ink from him still looked brand new. I used just this set to heal it, with the addition of some Oregon Soap Company hand soap for washing. I&#x27;ve tried other things, including A+D and Tattoo Goo, but this is the stuff I come back to. Nothing seems to heal my tattoos as well or easily as this stuff!</li>
    <li> The people leaving whatever if not negative feed back are tripping! This stuff works AMAZING! I have a decent amount of tattoos now, I&#x27;ve been getting work for about 3-4 yrs now and the last piece i got was on the top of my forearm pretty much a half a sleeve black and grey. First time i used H2ocean, all my other tattoos its just been the basic crap, moisturizing lotion, A&amp;D ointment, i&#x27;ve tried aloevera. Nothing can compare to this! It feels amazing just to use. the foam soap and the foam moisturizer, feels great when you apply it! Healed quicker then any other piece ive had. Does look like it helled in the color good. I used it until i was out of everything and then just used moisturizing body wash and lotion. if you do have a large piece i would recommened maybe getting 2 but i got an almost half sleeve and one pack was plenty for it to do its work. If youre getting a detailed piece, or has a lot of color in it, or you just appreciate the art. 100% get this product, it is def worth $25, and it will not let you down. H2OCEAN!</li>
    <li> first off i ordered this product on wednesday and got it on thursday to take with me to houston to get a few tattoos.... this product is awesome... i have many many tattoos and non of them felt this great just 24 hours later....no mess the anti bacterial soap isnt harsh and actually moisturizes as well... then the lotion is great because it is NOT petroleum based so there is no sticky or stinky oil residue...havent used the tatt lock in yet just because it&#x27;s only been 24 hours but i assume it will be fine...will always use this product going forward instead of dial a&amp;d ointment and unscented lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok... i am a bit obsessed with tattoos and i have been getting them for over 10 years now...i&#x27;ve used mainly tatt wax and a and d ointment both of which were really really itchy to my skin...i heal fine because ive got good skin but it makes the healing process annoying slapping instead of scratching or icing...if your into your tatts you know what im talking about...about the h20... this is NOT I reapeat NOT petroleum based which means vibrant healing with little to no fading at all... i wish i knew about this stuff for some of my color work that ive had done but thats ok because once i get them re worked i will be using this stuff for life...and btw you can use this on your older tattoos as well and you can also use the lotion it comes with on a daily basis for your daily moisturizer... no petroleum means no sticky tacky goo no grease stains on your clothes and your tattoo heals a lot quicker because it can breathe...not to worry it does include all of the anti bacterial stuff you need for a no infection hassle...quick fyi don&#x27;t buy these individually...if you go a head and buy all three the foam soap and the foam aftercare and lotion its like 25 bucks and the box with all three in it comes via amazon and free reg shipping...and you don&#x27;t need a lot if you are only using it for healing purposes....a lot of people say that the foam burns but getting the tattoo in the first place is a lot worse! it tingles it doesn&#x27;t burn...and trust me i have really sensitive skin i itch just from the tatt wax that&#x27;s supposed to be all natural!!!first place is a lot worse! it tingles it doesn&#x27;t burn...and trust me i have really sensitive skin i itch just from the tatt wax that&#x27;s supposed to be all natural!!!</li>
    <li> Alright so this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this kit...I have 3 tattoos, 2 very large ones which I have bought this kit for...One about a half sleeve size and one about 6x6 inches or so. Anyways....first of all, unless you have a small tattoo or use very sparingly this won&#x27;t last the 2-3 weeks healing time. Not the soap at least. I&#x27;ve been washing my new tattoo this time around for only 4 full days (2x a day) and the soap is already half way gone. I&#x27;d assume it will last me a week at the most. But my main issue with this product is the false advertising of being &amp;#34;ALL NATURAL&amp;#34; read the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see it contains PARABENS in the foam and the lotion. Not natural...It&#x27;s also causing some type of allergic reaction I believe on my tattoo....Every time I use the lotion/foam it BURNS badly. The soap doesn&#x27;t irritate it...so it is definitely the lotions. I&#x27;ve started using just coconut oil instead and having no issues now. I&#x27;ll just be making my own organic salve next time...Pretty disappointed because this is not cheap. I ordered once from amazon then the second time from the h20cean site directly...because they gave the 2 day priority mail option for $5 and ended up being cheaper than Amazon because I do not have Prime. The only thing I like about this product is the soap. Do yourself a favor and buy the soap separately and make or buy an organic salve if you truly care about a natural product.</li>
    <li> The foam actually makes the colors &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; in the healed tat after application.  Lotion applies smoothly and rubs in quickly, not greasy.  I plan to have plenty on hand for future work.</li>
    <li> I have plenty of tattoos and always run into issues when using ointment.  This is by far the best tattoo care I have found!  Does not leave that sticky feeling that Aquaphor or A&amp;D does and doesn&#x27;t make my skin react to it.</li>
    <li> the products seem to work better then the typical approach; happy I bought them</li>
    <li> My tatto shop recommended Tatwax but saw this and decided to give try. I didn&#x27;t need the soap but tried the two moisturizers. The foam seemed to be very effective as a moiturizer when I first applied but seemed to cause peeling the two times I used it in between using the Tatwax. The cream did not seem effective as a moisturizer at all. Could the peeling have been a coincidence? Perhaps but I am not going to test the theory and longer. Save your $$ and buy Tatwax.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try the skin moisturizing foam. I really didn&#x27;t like it. It left a weird film on my tattoo and really didn&#x27;t moisturize very well. I like the foaming soap. It&#x27;s not something I HAVE to use but I do like it. I would never heal a tattoo without H2Ocean lotion. I have 12 tattoos and have used H2Ocean lotion on all of them.</li>
    <li> I love the soap and foam moisturiser, but could do without the lotion. At first i thought the lotion would be good, it&#x27;s got a nice thick creamy texture to it. But after using it for a few days I just wasn&#x27;t impressed. My skin felt tight and dry only about an hour or so after putting it on. Was told by my tattoo artist to try Lubriderm and was much happier with it. The soap doesn&#x27;t lather up too much but definitely did a great job. The foam was nice too, you only need a little of it though, doesn&#x27;t take much at all. Will continue to use the soap and foam but will use a different lotion instead.</li>
    <li> Great for tattoos.  I have tried many different types of lotions but this is by far the best.  Has cut down my healing time by 40%.</li>
    <li> This stuff works magic. It is the ONLY aftercare I use during the healing process for my tattoos. 11 tattoos later and more to come you bets bet I will continue to use this stuff. It leaves your ink looking great and cut my healing time down to 1 week.</li>
    <li> My tattoo artist suggested using this product and I ended up loving it. The two tattoo&#x27;s I have gotten from her are still as bright as the first day and one of them is 4 years old. This stuff seriously cut down on my heal time and relieved some of the pain I&#x27;d normally endure.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone who like more natural options. I just recently got a pretty decent tattoo and H2Ocean has really helped through the healing process and it&#x27;s looking great!!! I was also very surprised how quickly it got to me which work out perfectly. Seeings how i needed ASAP;)</li>
    <li> The h2ocean worked so well on my new tattoo ! The instructions are easy to follow and it works . It was shipped quickly and was packaged well and I recomend this product to anyone getting a new tattoo!</li>
    <li> use this stuff all the time. It works really well and I have had no problems with it at all.</li>
    <li> I have 2 full sleeves and love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Healed tattoo quickly!</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is the best for anyone who has recently had ink work done!  The lotion goes on nicely and does not get greasy, the cleanser and all day care are amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m working on a full sleeve, and I bought this before the first session.  The outlining went very well, and healed very quickly.  Shading was a bit more painful and covered more canvas, and this product made the healing a breeze.  Now I&#x27;m starting color, and I expect great results as well.  I will continue to use this product.  My artist said he had never endorsed this product, but he&#x27;s glad I chose to use it.</li>
    <li> My son loved this now that he is bent on destroying his body!</li>
    <li> Used this on my fiance&#x27;s second tattoo and followed the directions word for word. We used baby lotion on her first tattoo, but I wanted to try something new for this one. Using this kit, her tattoo seemed to heal up faster, barely peel, and reduce any residual pain she was feeling. Overall, a great kit that we will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I would ever recommend to anyone needing tattoo aftercare. This is perfect for brightly colored tattoos. The set helped my very large, very colorful tattoo heal with very little scabbing and color loss. This stuff gets an A+!</li>
    <li> WORKED WELL FOR ALL MY TATTOOS, NOT MUCH SO BIGGER BOTTLES WOULD HELP MORE BUT MY TATTOOS HEALED BEAUTIFULLY WITH THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> I ordered this H2Ocean Ultimate Tattoo Care Kit to use on my first tattoo and it works fantastic! I first tried using Aquaphor as recommended by my artist and it made my tattoo ooze ink. So, I switched to using the 3 products in the H2Ocean kit and have had no problems since. It is now the 4th day and my Tiki tattoo on my ankle is healing fine with little or no itching and no scabbing. If you are serious about treating your new tattoo with the best care - you need to get and use this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this kit just to see how it works&lt;br /&gt;Its ok.&lt;br /&gt;I use Tattoo Goo and love that product&lt;br /&gt;The foam moisturizing is good and the soap is good to&lt;br /&gt;but the lotion was a problem for me made me break out on my arm.&lt;br /&gt;also felt like it didnt do that much for me.&lt;br /&gt;It might work for other people,&lt;br /&gt;it all depends on skin types.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked well at keeping my 3 tattoos clean after getting them, and keeps them looking great still to this day.  The moisturizing foam is awesome, puts a bit of life into my tats each time I apply it after a shower.</li>
    <li> bought this for my first tattoo.  very happy with how quickly I healed and it had a nice scent to it that wasn&#x27;t overbearing.  the only thing i wish i could change about it would be a bigger bottle of the foam soap.  i ran out of the soap well before the cream and the moisturizing foam.  would definitely recommend this to a buddy.</li>
    <li> Had a timely sale and am satisfied.I will use this product as often as I continue to ink people&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> I honestly thought this stuff would suck or be a waste of money but I&#x27;m surprised by how much it helped that&#x27;s a lot I will by a lot more I love this stuff</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful kit! I just got my first tattoo last month, and had been researching tattoo aftercare products. So I decided to order this. It&#x27;s wonderful. The moisturizing cream has a slight scent to it. It does smell like the ocean. All three products are soothing and keep my tattoo soft. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you&#x27;re getting your first tattoo.</li>
    <li> Faster healing time and does not burn nor sting like other tattoo healing methods. Defiantly not switching back to dial and  lubriderm.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous!! I have used this on 2 of my tattoos and the product is a great way to take care of a tattoo. I won&#x27;t use anything else! And the price is much cheaper here than buying direct from the manufacturer :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used H2Ocean products for helping piercings heal, but I had not heard of the tattoo care. It was recommended to me by a tattoo artist - and I love it! Highly recommend, and can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know this product was out there before.</li>
    <li> This was super cheap compared to what the stores were asking. It actually keeps my skin moisturized, unlike the other tattoo cleaning kits I tried. It has a light smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I recommend this to anyone who is getting a tattoo!</li>
    <li> Finding hypoallergenic unscented antibacterial soaps these days is like trying to find a toothpick in a hay bale. Every soap I tried always burned like hell on a fresh tat, this stuff works great and you know it is safe to use.</li>
    <li> Chose H2Ocean because I&#x27;ve used it before and keeps your tattoos looking new,and does a great job healing fresh tattoos heal.  Love it</li>
    <li> Best after care I&#x27;ve ever used .</li>
    <li> This is a great product for taking care of tattoos. I have many and have used a variety of lotions, balms etc... this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> This is pretty pricy stuff but it does some good work on your arm, truly it&#x27;s no needed but it does provide more comfort to your healing process and progress the process of healing as well. You would do fine with just basic unscented soap and lotion so it&#x27;s just a label that your really paying for which is the name more than anything. But it&#x27;s not needed for tattoos kinda like you don&#x27;t need a weekly spa treatment to wash your face just use soap. So I give it a high review for the performance of the product but by no means is it going to be this amazing tattoo healing product. It&#x27;s average folks.</li>
    <li> I have 2 tattoos just got my most recent one about 6 weeks ago .Saw this product a few days after I got my tattoo. I will never get another tattoo without usung this stuff. Works wonderfully on my still slightly sensitive tattoo (on the side and ankle of my foot)n I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Product works very well, I have used this for two tattoos and it really does a great job keeping the ink locked in and promoting fast healing.</li>
    <li> Overly enthusiastic, I ordered a few different items for tattoo aftercare the day before I was due to get my most elaborate piece yet. It had been 14 years since the last time I&#x27;d gotten new ink. Philosophies have changed about how to go about the healing process. That A&amp;D ointment I&#x27;d picked up last week wasn&#x27;t going to be my best bet if I wanted my art to remain vibrant. And while plenty of tattoo artists seem to be recommending simple care with unscented white lotion, I am one of those product junkies. I&#x27;m aware that there&#x27;s some perfectly good basic products, but I&#x27;m savvy enough to know that there&#x27;s some amazing solutions out there.&lt;br /&gt;But what&#x27;s best?&lt;br /&gt;I still might not know, but it&#x27;s not this.&lt;br /&gt;Confused by the one product deviation between this and the H2Ocean Extreme Tattoo Care, I sprung for both. Once they arrived, my confusion grew. Where the care card on this kit recommends the Ocean Care Moisturizing Cream as the moisturizer to start using on Day 1, the Extreme kit directs to not use it for the first day plus. Looking at the direction cards for both, this is the earlier produced kit with a copyright date of 2011 on the card.&lt;br /&gt;But of the two, this is the one I&#x27;ve used more.&lt;br /&gt;The foam soap is certainly a convenient item to throw in my bag to keep on top of my maintenance even at work. Both kits have this. Both kits also have the Ocean Care Skin Moisturizing Cream, an item that leaves me indifferent. Does the job, but I&#x27;d already knocked points off for the use of parabens. Not even just from a health standpoint, but with an awareness that in most cases, parabens are fillers. Just there to bulk out the product. The item that is the difference in the kits is the Ocean Foam Skin Moisturizing Foam, identified as a barrier. The item was not for me in the first week of healing. I have dry skin. I seek moisture. This only wound up feeling tight on my healing ink. However, after two weeks, with my peeling quite done and only slightly raised texture where the black lines are, I started liking this for the protective feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Still, whenever the ink urge strikes next, I&#x27;m not going to be seeking this kit. I&#x27;ve been experimenting, this just doesn&#x27;t impress.re where the black lines are, I started liking this for the protective feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Still, whenever the ink urge strikes next, I&#x27;m not going to be seeking this kit. I&#x27;ve been experimenting, this just doesn&#x27;t impress.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few other aftercare systems but this one is by far my favorite! My tattoo looks just as good as the day I got it done.</li>
    <li> This arrived just in time! I had just gotten a new tattoo and I wasn&#x27;t quite satisfied with using simple A &amp; E and unscented lotion for the care of my tattoo. Honestly, those previous products were too thick and messy and I felt like my tattoo couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; while it was healing. I did a bit of research and decided to check out H2Ocean. I&#x27;m glad I did! My tattoo healed faster than the last ones with almost no scabbing. The ink is just as vibrant and clear as day 1 and my skin is nice and hydrated without being suffocated. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more of this in the future!</li>
    <li> this is hands down the best for tattoo&#x27;s, I used tattoo guu for years and on countless inkwork. but once I was introduced to H2Ocean, it changed the way I did things. it has a great fragrance and it never over dries and the best part it&#x27;s not petroleum based like most products out there for tattoo recovery, it actually wipes clean like most foamy hand sanitizers out there now. I will continue to use and recommend this product to all my fellow tattoo inkster brothers and sisters</li>
    <li> Excellent product for after tattoo care. Easy application and convenient</li>
    <li> This product gave me an infection so bad that i had to go to the ER and now im on meds to help with the pain and fight the infection.</li>
    <li> I have a hade cancer and got all my scares covered with a big tattoe. I love the product and help in the recovery. I will use and recommend this to all my friends, thanks</li>
    <li> used these products on my recent tattoo. i think they helped keep the colors bold and sharp. small containers but didnt run out with daily use on my forarm</li>
    <li> I usually use Tattoo Goo, and decided to try this H2Ocean product. I am SO sorry that I did! This product is awful. I absolutely hated it. It doesn&#x27;t smell good either, like Tattoo Goo does. I followed their regiment of cleaning and salve then cream. This product ate my tattoo up. It certainly didn&#x27;t help it heal. I ended up with 2 huge craters in the tattoo. Miserable stuff! Stick with Tattoo Goo, that&#x27;s my advice.</li>
    <li> Best tattoo aftercare in the world. I think every tattoo should be used by H2Ocean. Easy steps to learn, no more A&amp;D!</li>
    <li> Awesome set! works great</li>
    <li> Compared to most tattoo shops prices this a great savings. I have used it for the last three years as an after care kit and if used as directly it will definitely smooth the healing process.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really give a fair comparison to anything else, since I used this on my first tattoo, but it worked great for me. I was completely healed in about 10 days and the colors of my ink still look as good as the day I got it. For me, this kit was worth it for the soap alone, as it&#x27;s difficult to find unscented, antibacterial soap nowadays. But I liked the moisturizing cream and foam too. My tattoo is pretty small (about 4 inches by 4 inches), so I had more than enough of everything to care for it.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do what it claims for me. I followed the instructions precisely and nothing. So not only did I waste money but time as well. Thanks for nothing!</li>
    <li> I had the first part of my tattoo done and used this product as it was a gift from my wife. I used this kit as the instructions told meand my tattoo was fully healed in five days. I used Lubriderm for my other tattoos. I use the blue-green foam after a day outside and then apply the moisturizing foam and my tattoo looks like it had just been done. I purchased two more kits for the reaminder of my tattoo. I thought it was well worth the money paid.</li>
    <li> I like the product as a moisturizer, but I feel like it was TOO moisturizing. I didn&#x27;t start scabbing until four days after I got my tattoo, and you&#x27;re supposed to within 24-48 hours. I scabbed much sooner with my other tattoo. The color, which is mostly blue-ish gray, did not stick very well. I have to go in for a touch up this week because of it. I will not be using h2ocean for the healing process this go around, hopefully it sticks better. I do not want another touch up on a detailed rib piece again, ouch.</li>
    <li> first time user of this product- half sleeve with bullets flames and an m16- it&#x27;s over a month old and looks like it did right when I got off the chair- I recommend this product to anyone who is willing to do &amp;#34;after stab maintenance&amp;#34; on their work</li>
    <li> This worked great on my new tattoo.  I healed very quickly, and was easy to use.  I liked the non-greasy feel compared to ointments.</li>
    <li> Great product. Like everything. Don&#x27;t really think the foam would be sufficent to protect though. However, used this in addition to aquafor and healed up nicely. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Easy 1-2-3 steps and heals fast.</li>
    <li> I got my first tattoo and followed the kit instructions. The kit not only had everything I needed but also there was more than enough of each product. It also gave me day by day instructions from day one on. I would say it a great kit to get. Also the price was very good form Amazon. Better than what most sites charge.</li>
    <li> Normally I just use unscented liquid soap and moisturizer for post care.  Given all the colors on this new one I splurged on this pack.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t.  Followed their instructions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and I ended up with the slowest healing, thickest scabs I&#x27;ve ever seen on a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No infection just lousy lousy healing and awful awful scabs.  10 days after my tattoo and it&#x27;s still ugly from using this stuff the first few days.</li>
    <li> best tattoo set out there</li>
    <li> These sped up my healing process. No infection no problem it works great.  And my tattoos look as bright as the first day</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous,  I&#x27;ve used these to help heal a few of my tattoos that I&#x27;ve gotten and it works great!</li>
    <li> I Got a full sleeve(in color) done and i usually use TattooGoo but i wanted to try something different, saw the great reviews and gave it a shot. So far my tattoo is healing fine, but the foam soap doesn&#x27;t last long (and not just because i have a sleeve) so this would be ideal for smaller pieces, the Lotion is THICK! Whoa, it has the consistency of toothpaste so the first day it was painful since my arm was sore and parts were swollen,so when using the lotion it will take longer than you would expect... trust me. Now the blue foam is OK, nothing special about it. Honestly if your tat is small go for it, but for larger pieces ill stick with the tattoogoo kit... Hope this helps</li>
    <li> This is a product I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;To a stranger a family or a friend&lt;br /&gt;I recently got a new tattoo&lt;br /&gt;And now it&#x27;s time to keep it new&lt;br /&gt;Everyday I follow the same routine&lt;br /&gt;I start with a wash of the soap blue green&lt;br /&gt;And then with the ocean foam&lt;br /&gt;I do this all before my hair is comb&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least after my hair&lt;br /&gt;A dab a bit of ocean care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well! I&#x27;ve used A+D in the past and so at first I was worried about putting too much of the ocean care on, I eventually realized that I should have used more because it dried out way quicker than A+D, also it&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. I healing fairly quickly, I stop oozing after a few hours so this bundle was great for me, if you ooze a lot longer I&#x27;d recommend you get a bottle of aquatat to supplement this kit. My tattoo is looking great and it&#x27;s almost completely healed. Great Product and good results.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price! This stuff is cutting edge for tattoo healing, and works great. No problems for those with sensitive skin that I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s super moisturizing and won&#x27;t stain your clothes.</li>
    <li> This kept my tattoo clean and helped to slough the dead skin as the tattoo healed. My skin is smooth, moisturizer and the color is retained. My skin stayed moisturizer much longer than other lotions that were water based (curel)</li>
    <li> Definitely recommended for use with new tattoos.  I had a medium sized color tattoo on shoulder.  I used this kit and it healed great.</li>
    <li> ocean foam arrived with no air pressure, leaks out like a bad can of whip cream. I&#x27;ve used this product in the past so I know its a good product, but unfortunately I won&#x27;t be able to use this can and the seller offers no returns. makes me wish I bought it from a tattoo shop instead.</li>
    <li> Virtually everything I have read about tattoo aftercare cautions against the use of products containing fragrances and alcohol in caring for a new tattoo, yet these products do.  And they irritate/sting when applied.  Wish I had paid more attention before ordering.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, no itching and my artist even said that my tat healed great too.</li>
    <li> The best for tattoos!</li>
    <li> I have been in the stages over the last few months getting tattoos on my foot and leg. I used the H20 kit. The cleanser and cream worked well. I don&#x27;t really think it worked dramatically better than picking up stuff at my local CVS to use. The 2oz size containers are very easy to travel with which I liked a lot. The Ocean Foam was my fav out of the 3 products. It made my tattoo look vibrant and provided moisture without being heavy. So if you are looking for a nice small kit that is easy to travel with then this one is as good as any out there but I was not blown away by any of the products.</li>
    <li> Only use the skin moisturizing cream to shine up an already healed tattoo. The rest is overpriced garbage and may just cause you problems due to excessive dry out. DO NOT USE FOR AFTERCARE!! Unscented soap and Aquaphor work just fine and cost half of what this kit costs. Don&#x27;t believe all the hype this company puts out. I have used dove soap and Aquaphor since I was 18. I am now 39 and heavily tattooed. My tattoos look just as great as when I got them. I used this product once and had to go back to Aquaphor mid heal due to excessive dry out which resulted in my tattoo having to be gone over again. Sensitive and dry skin &#x3D; stay away from H2Ocean. I got sucked in due to all the wonderful praise this product gets from spokespeople, artists, tattoo models. It&#x27;s all hype. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it. Lesson learned. Garbage. You have been warned.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I used it on one of my bigger, colorful tattoos for the first time. It worked great!</li>
    <li> Once I got the product and realized it does not do what is expected, I tried to return it. Return not allowed. No more purchases from me from this sell errrrrrrrr</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Does what it says it does. My new tattoo on my neck took about 1 1/2 weeks to fully heal. The fastest time for any of my tattoos and it still looks great. Well worth the price! I&#x27;m going to use this for all of my future tattoos.</li>
    <li> MY SKIN BROKE OUT INTO HORRIBLE WHITEHEADS.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE&lt;br /&gt;STICK WITH THE USUAL...ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP, AND LUBRIDERM. WORKS LIKE A CHARM.</li>
    <li> I like the moisturizer the most of all in this set. Would probably recommend just washing with dial liquid soap, soaking that tattoo in the hottest water you can stand twice a day for the first week, then using this moisturizer. My tattoo healed very fast, and absolutely without texture. :)</li>
