<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Yes yes, yes. I love them. They are the same way it is describe. People should buy with no fear. I am happy that I bought them. I love it.</li>
    <li> These days perfume is so expensive so i buy scented lotions from bath and body works instead.And this one is my favorite. It smells so so so good! I do love that lotion moisturizes too. This one makes your skin super soft.I love it! I will buy more soon. This scent is there most popular for obvious reasons,(A) it smells Fantastic , (B) Same as reason A, and (C) Same as reasons A and B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a tip for buying it: Have a receipt from bath and body works, and do the phone survey and get the code for $10 off your $30 purchase, and then go to Bath And Body Works and use the buy 3 bottles get 2 free deal.Each bottle is 10.50 so for 3 bottles it is 31.50 and $10.00 off is 21.50. So you pay 21.50 for 5 big bottles of lotion. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of japanese cherry blossom but these days feels like the scent has been changed. I miss the original scent of japanese cherry blossom.</li>
    <li> Fav, fav, FAV floral scent ever! Since most of us don&#x27;t ever really have Japanese Cherry Blossoms at home or sent to us, imagine a fresh rose in your hand...hold it up to your nose...inhale...add a little sweetness to that scent and that is what this lotion smells like. It is not too strong but not so light that an hour later you have no clue you even put it on. This bottle usually lasts me 2-3 months (it&#x27;s a thinner lotion so you really get your money&#x27;s worth). I prefer the lotion over the body cream because of that fact.     Best part of the lotion? Every time I put it on after a shower my boyfriend tells me I smell \\&quot;sooooo good.\\&quot; :-)</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good and  do keep my skin moisture and comfortable. Thank very much for delivered the package on time a big bargain</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth and clean fragrance and goes on really nicely. I use it often and buy it in candle form when it is available.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful and used in conjunction with the rest of its set, it leaves one feeling refreshed and smelling Heavenly. It is not overwhelming at all, just pleasingly fragrant.</li>
    <li> My wife love,s this stuff,and  it,s fragrence seems to last all day.I may be ordering some more soon.Glad I found it @ Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product, mostly the smell .. hehe and really happy i finally received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes i  would recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> very fast shipping thank you! this is my favorite bath and body works scent!!! i have the bath wash, lotion. and the body mist!! love it lol</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances and it is long lasting.  So I love wearing it.  I just wish the body spray that I bought along with it lasted as long.</li>
    <li> After waiting for this to arrive at my house...I went to open a bottle to use, It was scotch taped shut. This is not how you buy them at Bath and Body Works.. It states on your page that it is NEW that is not the case. Thanks but no thanks For the Classy Shop</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It has a very soft, lovely, unobtrusive scent. It&#x27;s also very creamy, but not greasy. Have reordered several times.</li>
    <li> Smells great, looks great, feels great, taste great (wait, what?). My girlfriend loved it and uses it all the time. Favorite scent that bath &amp; body works has.</li>
    <li> It feels good on leaving your skin feel silky. The bonus is it smells great, I have given this out now at different times to family to even out the number of gifts at Christmas each time it is a big hit.</li>
    <li> This product smells heavenly! It softens the skin and leaves one smelling wonderful. This product lasts all day and is well worth the price. It is long-lasting and I would like to purchase the entire set; therefore not only will I smell wonderful, but will be softening my body regularly.This particular fragrance smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Very good product as Well as useful. I like everything of this product. I world recomend it to moms with newborns.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this scent from Bath &amp; Body Works. Fragrances are terribly personal as to liking or not liking, so ask the wife first if this is what she likes before buying or (heaven forbid) hit your local mall &amp; check out the fragrance before buying, but my wife really loves it &amp; I earned mega bonus points for getting it for her. I like the smell of it too as it&#x27;s a light fragrant smell and isn&#x27;t too overbearing. The lotion apparently is really great too (wife loves it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you (or your significant other) dig this scent, grab a bottle. I can&#x27;t overstate the awesomeness of having it show up to my house instead of having to fight the mall to pick it up (being a guy, I could do without the mall entirely &amp; having to go into the foo foo girly Bath &amp; Body Works store &amp; deal with the &amp;#34;you know, if you buy another bottle of this [overpriced] girly lotion you&#x27;ll save another $$$ dollars&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;would you like to upgrade your order to the super expensive super girly foo foo package?&amp;#34; staff isn&#x27;t exactly on my &amp;#34;awesome things to do&amp;#34; list, so home delivery rocked!) and the price was great! Plus, with Prime, it landed here before the wife&#x27;s birthday &amp; shipping was free so I got great bonus points for that too (and saved some coin--oh yeah!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle arrived with some tape over the top of it to keep it from leaking. The tape did leave a bit of sticky residue on the bottle, but I didn&#x27;t care &amp; neither did the wife (remember folks, you don&#x27;t have to go to the mall--small price to pay. Sticky label vs. dealing with a bunch of raging hormone girls screaming &amp; giggling through the mall rolling their eyes at the &amp;#34;old man buying lotion for his wife&amp;#34;--yeah, I&#x27;ll take the slightly sticky label ANY day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you (or your significant other) dig this type of thing. And if you&#x27;re the guy buying it for her, remember, Bath &amp; Body Works lotion &#x3D; bonus points for you! Happy wife, happy life. Comprende? She&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;m happy. We&#x27;re all happy (and now she smells great too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. I&#x27;d buy it again.&#x27;m happy. We&#x27;re all happy (and now she smells great too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Leaves you sexy &amp; soft ... I always feel refreshed after putting it on after a nice shower!</li>
    <li> I buy this for my wife because she likes all the Bath &amp; Body Works products.  We both like this Japanese Cherry Blossom scent.  She primarily uses this lotion on her arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Mother is a Bath &amp; Body addict. I guess that you could be addicted to worst things in your like.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizing and non-greasy lotion. Very good in treating dry skin. The skin remains shining, smooth and without skin cracks.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and enjoy using this lotion ! :-) I enjoy using this lotion on a regular basis!</li>
    <li> I used it several times, I still like it. The ONLY thing I noticed to be different than the original ones I purchased from bath and beyond, was the fragance did not last as long. It lasted a bout 1-2 hours.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this collection from Bath and Body works and to find it way cheaper on Amazon was a blessing.  I just love the light floral smell of this lotion.</li>
    <li> Absorb quickly, and love the smell. Put it into your fridge even better. Good one in a good price, cheaper than in store.</li>
    <li> this was ordered for a birthday gift and was well received , my daughter just loved it and was so excited it got here on time</li>
    <li> Received as a gift and I love this scent! It&#x27;s not too strong nor does it fade with an alcohol linger like I&#x27;ve noticed many of vs scents do. This scent has woodsy notes bouqueted with subtle, yet comforting floral. The scent really takes me to a nice sweater weather sort of place though I will wear this all year long. Very nice if you&#x27;re in a comfy sort of mood well.</li>
    <li> This is great lotion. It smells wonderful and is my favorite.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, our bedroom smells like a cherry blossom lane each workday morning.&lt;br /&gt;The price was excellent although the shipping charges were excessive.</li>
    <li> love all there product it last a long time and you dont have to use a lot bath &amp; body is one of the best</li>
    <li> Especially when you are the one wearing their delicate scent.  This is such a favorite, long lasting scent in a cream form that I now use it almost exclusively.  It makes a lovely little gift for folks you know who like delicate scents.  This one is really delightful.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  Its scent is delicious and not too strong like some scented lotions.  In fact, I usually stay away from scented lotions but my sister was wearing this at a family reunion and I loved it so much, I purchased some for myself.  This would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> 100% recommended excellent product</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift and they love it. the smell is wonderful and she says it keeps her hands from getting dry.</li>
    <li> I have a collection of Bath &amp; Body Works lotion, as well as Victoria’s Secret lotions. Each lotion has a unique scent, and it’s own personality to fit you as an individual.  Whether the lotion makes you feel fun and flirty, or sexy and confident, the question is, what brand of lotion is the better product? As most don’t know, the two stores are sister stores, meaning they share the same corporate. Wouldn’t that mean their lotions are the same? Not quite. Bath &amp; Body Works lotion is a better value than Victoria’s Secret lotion because it contains more beneficial ingredients, is made with durable packaging, and is a better set price.&lt;br /&gt;The most important factor of lotion is the ingredients and how it is going to help moisturize your skin. Every bottle of Bath &amp; Body Works lotion contains Vitamin E, Shea butter, and Jojoba.  Vitamin E helps skin cells and provides a healthier skin, Shea butter provides relief from dry skin, and Jojoba helps bring out the natural oils in our skin. All of these are listed on the front of the lotion bottles and are easy to access. On the other hand, Victoria’s Secret all contained shimmer in their lotions, which can easily give rashes to individuals with sensitive skin. The Victoria’s Secret lotions also did not contain Shea butter or any vitamins. Of course, the ingredients are on the back or the bottom of the lotion, and are typed so tiny that it isn’t understandable. All in all, Bath &amp; Body Works lotion contains more beneficial ingredients than Victoria’s Secret lotion.&lt;br /&gt; Secondly, the packaging of Bath &amp; Body Works is more durable than the Victoria’s Secret bottles. The Victoria’s Secret bottles are cheaply made. If they are dropped within three feet of the floor, they crack instantly. The labels fade easily, which makes it hard to tell apart being that all of their bottles look the same. Although Victoria’s Secret packaging is pretty, it is not made to last longer than a month after it’s purchase. Unlike Victoria’s Secret bottles, Bath &amp; Body Works lids never get stuck. If they do somehow, they are easy to replace at the store. The bottles will not crack if they are dropped or stepped on. Most importantly, the labels stay in tact. They do not fade over time and are reliable for months later to use.&lt;br /&gt; Last but not least, the price of Bath &amp; Body Works is clearly a better value than Victoria’s Secret. Bath &amp; Body Works bottles are eleven dollars each, but they always have a buy three get two free deal. This includes five bottles for about $6.50 each. Bath &amp; Body Works also always has coupons online or sent through email and mail monthly. On the other hand, Victoria’s Secret lotions are seventeen to twenty-four dollars. Their store sends out coupons only if you hold a credit card with their store, and the lotions are never on sale. Victoria’s Secret is a bit pricey for lotions that do not offer as much as Bath &amp; Body Works. To get more for your money, Bath &amp; Body Works is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt; All in all, Bath &amp; Body Works is a more wise choice because it contains better ingredients, has better quality packaging, and is a smarter price. The Shea butter &amp; Vitamins in the unbreakable Bath &amp; Body Works lotion will last longer while nourishing your skin. At four to six dollars, it is the best way to provide moisture to your body. During the Semi-Annual sale there are even bottles for two to three dollars! Unless you are willing to pay for high priced bottles that are weak and do not provide enough nourishment for skin, Victoria’s Secret is definitely not the best brand. Bath &amp; Body Works is a better lotion because it is clearly the better value within skin care, packaging, and price.</li>
    <li> Love this scent from Bath and Body works.  A very light and crisp.  A must have for your after bath or shower needs.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance-not overwhelming. There are many other products in this line. I have not been disappointed. Frequently gift it to folks who are ill instead of flowers.</li>
    <li> I usually use lotions from VS, this was just as of good. Great lingering clean smell of cherry blossoms and moisturized the entire body!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. Not overpowering, and feels great on the skin! I would order again. Thats all I have to say!</li>
    <li> Try this lotion if you haven&#x27;t yet.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Also try &amp;#34;dark kiss&amp;#34; from this company.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with this product.it was sent in a timely fashion,and I was kept updated via E-mail as to when my product had been mailed and when to expect the item.I will definatly use this site in the future</li>
    <li> my mother in law really loved it as a christmas gift she loves both and body things for any event.</li>
    <li> Had one at work and had to have one for home, now everybody else likes it, so more are coming. Must try different ones from the maker.</li>
    <li> Love the Lotion, wear it all the time, receive compliments after compliments, will always buy this, sexy, sexy and sexy...</li>
    <li> amazing! makes my skin super soft and leaves a great scent. I don&#x27;t eve bother using the spray because this alone is great for smelling nice.It&#x27;s kinda strong but after awhile leaves the skin with a subtle scent.</li>
    <li> My favorite smell &#x3D;) If you&#x27;ve never used it before definitely give it a try. Just a note though, Bath &amp; Body Works lotions are often known for their stop smells and not their moisturizing capabilities. So if you have extra dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. But for its smell, oh boy do i love it!</li>
    <li> First time buying lotion online. Smells good, but bottle is not sealed, and label is scratched, which is suspicious. Will go to a store to pick one next time.</li>
    <li> Not only is it wonderful lotion but the slight fragrance stays with me. Wonderful product. Try it! I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells fantastic and it moisturizes well. However, being a guy, the smell was a bit too strong when I put it all over my body and made it seem like I was wearing a woman&#x27;s perfume. The scent also lasts all day and so does the moisturizing effect. All in all, the lotion is great, just don&#x27;t put it on all over your body if you&#x27;re a guy or people would ask you if you&#x27;re wearing women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
    <li> it was an awsome fragrance and it got here quickly liked every thing disliked nothing i will recommend your company</li>
    <li> Smells so good. The lotion is very creamy so I feel like it lasts a long time keeping your hands hydrated. To be honest, I love all of Bath and Body Works products.</li>
    <li> This product was given to a friend and when I tried a little of it I just loved the fragrance and how soft my skin felt after using it without feeling greasy.  I use it sparingly and get many compliments when I use it.</li>
    <li> The scent is very soft and feminine. There is nothing overpowering about it at all. The scent has pretty good lasting power as well. I put the lotion on one of my shirts and the scent was still on it days later. Amazing. It seems to smell even better after a while of being on my skin. It even moisturizes my skin slightly.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels wonderful. I&#x27;ll buy it over and over again. The price was very reasonable, too! I highly recommend it. It came very quickly.</li>
    <li> These Bath&amp;Body works scents are just too strong.  Ok, the scent is ok, nothing spectacular.  However, if you put enough on to be a moisturizer you would smell so strong no one could stand being around you.  If you just want to smell good - then you can only use a tiny amount - I&#x27;m talking smaller than a dime size amount - more like a green pea size....maybe even smaller than that.  Or else it&#x27;ll be too strong.  This is really a drawback for me.  Bodycology is much better in my opinion - you can use more without it overpowering.  I wouldn&#x27;t say any of these really moisturize though!</li>
    <li> Who does not love this line of products?  It is one of my favorite gift purchase as well.</li>
    <li> delicious fragrance.  I love it</li>
    <li> My six-year-old niece loves cherries and needed some body lotion she would use.  As she&#x27;s in her pink princess stage, this worked very well -- she loved the scent, which wasn&#x27;t too strong, and didn&#x27;t set off her skin allergies.</li>
    <li> The original scent was very nice and for some reason they changed it.  I will not wear this and need to give it away.  Please bring back the original scent/formula.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I just don&#x27;t understand why my orders were sent seperately. Otherwise, I am highly satisfied with the product.</li>
