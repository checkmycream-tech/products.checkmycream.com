      <li>Encapsulated inside each perfectly portioned pearl is a silky opaque serum similar in texture &amp; smell to some Olay products in the same price point like the Regenerist Serum, but this specifically contains retinol.</li>
      <li>only used it in the A.M. before putting on my makeup and was still very satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>Taken with proper vitamins and hydration, this is the single best line I use.    </li>

      <li>They always say look to see if water is the first ingredient??</li>

      <li>- They dry out your skin (causing more pimples) and bleach your sheets and towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B001DYM5Y6 Perlabella Retinol Anti-Aging Face , Pure Dose Pearls With Microsponge Technology]]I have used this product for over a year.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, these Pearls are pure Retinol....  </li>

      <li>Clear, radiant, smooth, tight, plump and acne free.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Why did you choose this rating? 5 stars --&amp;#62; I love it&lt;br /&gt;What did you like? Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;Who would you recommend this product to? all my buddy</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001DYM5Y6 Perlabella Retinol Anti-Aging Face , Pure Dose Pearls With Microsponge Technology]]I have used this product for over a year. It is fabulous! I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It really helps to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and lines on your face and neck. It is simple and easy to use and it makes your skin feel wonderful, so smooth and soft.  The only problem I have found with it is the ability to actually find it. Ulta used to carry it and so did Walgreen&#x27;s but no more. Amazon is the only place that I have been able to locate it. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is comparable to Philosophy&#x27;s retinol capsules...unfortunately the retinol percentage in neither of these products are on the package. However, I prefer this to Philosophy because considering Amazon&#x27;s price, the price is lower and that is always a good thing:)</li>
    <li> I was thinking like other products, this product would just sit on the surface of my face and look and feel greasy. NO it didnt. It instantly is absorbed and leaves the skin feeling soft and velvety. You can apply foundation right after applying this and it goes on even smoother. Can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful product and I am hard to please. My skin looks and feels much healthier.</li>
    <li> Silky, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, feels great going on.  It works gently over a few days so you can learn to apply it to desired potency.  I tried the RoC, but the RoC is sticky and doesn&#x27;t seem as effective.  I highly recommend Perlabella retinol.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, this product doesn&#x27;t just sit on the top of your face, being greasy for hours on end.  It soaks in almost immediately, and it really has made a difference in the quality and appearance of my skin.    I use the entire Perlabella line: Retinol face, Retinol eye, Vitamin C and Q10.  And my friends keep telling me how young I look (44 years old).     Taken with proper vitamins and hydration, this is the single best line I use.    I&#x27;d also recommend anything with Sea Buckthorn (Oridel Silk, for example, and capsules taken internally), it&#x27;s what I use after the Perlabella line.</li>
    <li> Perlabella has a small line of very nice products that you can find in both 7 &amp; 28ct portions. I&#x27;ll admit the pearls are more hype for presentation than anything. And I still require a pair of sheers to open it. At the very least it inhibits you from wasting it. Encapsulated inside each perfectly portioned pearl is a silky opaque serum similar in texture &amp; smell to some Olay products in the same price point like the Regenerist Serum, but this specifically contains retinol. This product goes on light &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a thick residue feeling like lotions or creams can. I doll out the entire pearl onto two fingers, pair them with the corresponding two fingers of my other hand so I have some to pat on either side of my face. After dotting it about, I massage it in. Seems to be the easiest way to get even coverage. Only use them at night. You&#x27;ll get better results as your skin (&amp; body) spends it&#x27;s time amidst sleep recovering from the day. Can be used with other products, but I would use caution when mixing too many ingredients together, (especially with retinol) until you are sure they won&#x27;t overdry or cause irritation. Overall, the perlabella line is great. If you go to their website you&#x27;ll find they offer great offers. They have a Q-10 line with a $10 off printable coupon.</li>
    <li> This product is just great I get lovely results with none of the burn of other retinal systems I have tried.</li>
    <li> I like this product because you don&#x27;t get greasy and it goes right into the skin. I can even use one capsule 2 nights because it spreads so fine. I want to try all of the skin line and will be doing so soon.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  It goes on like silk and soaks in almost instantly.  I was using it for my fine lines and did see improvement within about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used it in the A.M. before putting on my makeup and was still very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I have used Vitamin C, Q10 and the Hyaluronic - love all but cannot find the product easily and the Hyaluronic is no where to be found - do they still make this?</li>
    <li> Okay, I am 51,and my skin is beautiful! I&#x27;ve had spider veins zapped, Venus Freeze for skin tightening and fillers around my mouth!  I rinse my face in the morning only with lukewarm water! I use my daily serum, moisterizer, firming lotion, foundation and that is it. At night I cleanse the daily grime.  I do not rub my face and never use a wash rag! The smoothness of my skin is due these little Anti-Aging pearls for face! I actually use two for both face and neck. You must use them faithfully every night! Once in a while won&#x27;t cut it! Good skin takes dedication!</li>
    <li> They always say look to see if water is the first ingredient?? There is  NO water in this??NO water???? At this price and MICRSPONGE technology?? I love this stuff..The price cannot be beat and it works!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 and I have used several anti-wrinkle products over the last 5 years, from the least expensive to extremely expensive and have never been impressed ... until now.  Perlabella Retinol is amazing!  I&#x27;ve been using the anti-aging retinol for face for almost 3 months and love the results.  Are my wrinkles gone?  Heck no!  I wish.  But they are definitely visibly reduced ... thinner and with less depth.      I use one pearl every night and my skin is so soft ... like it was when I was in my 20&#x27;s.    I have not tried the other products in the Perlabella line but plan to and hope that they will be equally as wonderful.</li>
    <li> If I wasn&#x27;t in my PJ&#x27;s at the moment, I&#x27;d do a video review to show that at 47, my skin truly does pass for 37.  I&#x27;ve been using Retinol products since my 30&#x27;s, along with lots of Sunscreen in the summer.  Pro-Retinol does not reduce wrinkles, it is too weak, it needs to be Retinol.    Remember, Retin A that is used for acne.....?? That is the strongest form of Vitamin A (Retinol) you can get.  Too strong for most faces though, but people using it found that it reduced their wrinkles.... Thus the introduction of Retinol onto to cosmetic scene.    Anyhow, these Pearls are pure Retinol....  I mix them with some other moisturizer and between the two, it all seems to work so far.</li>
    <li> this is 28 separate capsules - break one open to use each night, which is a very tiny amount - I used around my lip wrinkles and didn&#x27;t see any improvement - but I&#x27;m old, think I need something more powerful</li>
    <li> This product makes my face feel smooth and silky.  It is a little pricey, so I use it sparingly, every other month!</li>
    <li> It is OK but the vials are smaller, less product, less results, more expensive. Not worth the money. Just ok.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great works great on my skin makes it feel more subtle and smooth gives it that youthful look</li>
    <li> I went to the derma and she asked if I was using any retinol products. I said, &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;. She said, &amp;#34;you&#x27;ve got beautiful skin&amp;#34;. I credit my skin to genetics, a healthy diet and skin products. I use an spf daily(Cera Ve), a PM night cream and this product. I typically apply it first and then let it set. After that I apply my PM Cera Ve cream. This goes on silky smooth as other users have pointed out. I took a page from someone else&#x27;s book and only use half of each pearl. It spreads nicely and you don&#x27;t really need to use all of it. So..it stretches the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year, and it has made a visible improvement in texture and softness of my skin.  It really makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I like the product, the way it fills, but. I never use retinol before and this one do nothing to me. Still, maybe it does, but I don&#x27;t feel it.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this twice now and love it, I have noticed a difference in evening my skin tone. This product is so soft and gentle on skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> Goes on light non greasy, skin feels soft and smooth afterwards. It does not treat spots just softens which is fine. I have very sensitive skin prone to rash breakouts and this product was gentle enough for me. No breakouts at all.</li>
    <li> Each capsule is a perfect dose for night time face treatment, and it is so easy to throw a few into my toiletries for travel!</li>
    <li> I really dislike the packaging, as it exceeds even normal packaging tricks to make it look as if more is included than really is. There is a small window on the box through which you can see some product - that is all there is. The rest inside the box is empty space. The bottom inch of the actual 5\\&quot; tube holding the product is foam to avoid having to fill the entire thing. The capsules also allow for a lot of empty space in the tube. Ostensibly these capsules are necessary to prevent sunlight damaging the contents, but other companies with less scammy packaging do this with an opaque bottle and not empty, space-creating pods. In fact, there are 28 pods, each with 0.011 fl oz. in them. That means that, for all the packaging, there is only .308 oz, less than one third an ounce, of product in the total package.  There is only .02 ounces of active ingredient. You are paying the equivalent of almost 900 USD per ounce of retinol when you pay 17.99 for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the product. It does contain some retinol and does create mild improvement in my skin as compared to no retinol. It also has no adjustment period like some retinol products do. So that is a good thing. However, the percentage of the actual active ingredient in very low (it doesn&#x27;t say what is is anywhere on the box but elsewhere online I&#x27;ve read reports of the low percentage of .07%).. Unsurprisingly, the results are not nearly as significant as compared to when using products with a higher concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: it&#x27;s better than nothing but the packaging is scammy and you will get better, more lasting results for less money with a different product. For me that meant starting with skinceuticals at .5% and then moving to 1% as my skin got used to it. I also got more than three times the product for a lower price with each order. My skin glows and I pay a fair price.</li>
    <li> I look 15 years younger and I give this a lot of the credit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Perlabella pure dose pearls on and off for years, and in a recent effort to simplify my skincare routine, decided to revisit them.  I&#x27;m 42 years old, and was an avid sun-worshipper back in the day, much to the detriment of my skin.  I have some large pores, wrinkling under/around my eyes, and some light \\&quot;blotchy\\&quot; spots.  I&#x27;ve tried everything (at every price) from basic moisturizers to a (very disappointing) $5k Fraxel Repair procedure.  Perlabella pearls are convenient, inexpensive, and most of all, EFFECTIVE.  I use the Retinol pearls every night, and my skin looks and feels absolutely amazing in the morning!  My pores are smaller, my skin has better, more even tone, and my \\&quot;blotchy\\&quot; areas are less noticeable.  I combine these with use of the Q10 pearls in the morning, and have seen an impressive difference after only three weeks.  Would definitely recommend these... they&#x27;re just awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this product line and have used it for a long time. I would always highly recommend. They work great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time and I think its great.  I am a beach junky and my skin is smooth and wrinkle-free in part to using this product every night.</li>
    <li> ARE U TRULY NOT SELLING THIS ANY MORE PLS LET ME KNOW JOAN ELLIOTT</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel good but can&#x27;t see a difference. I used the entire package hoping I could see some difference, but couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I was given a gift from my sister a few years ago and only recently started using it. I was complimented on my face (without any makeup) by no less than 6  people over a 2 day space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now got a stock of them as they really do work and make skin soft smooth and younger looking - even wthout makeup.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture of this product. It leaves the skin as soft as velvet with absolutely no oily residue. I have a sensitive skin, and most products will leave a thin layer on my face that ends up irritating it more than anything else. Those capsules are ideally sized, and it&#x27;s just a pleasure to apply the product. I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments about how good my skin looked since I started this regimen, including from my beautician herself - I could tell she was very perplex and wondering if I were seeing someone else for my facials.</li>
    <li> I think I have tried everything else on the market but Perabella makes the skin on this 70 year old face smooth and helps eliminate wrinkles</li>
    <li> I will never change everyone thinks I am around 57, I am 67. The doctor started me on retinol A for problems with my face. I found Perlabella after my medication was done. I love it.</li>
    <li> Was looking for something to put on my face after washing that wasn&#x27;t too drying or too oily. This product goes on smoothly and makes your face feel velvety soft. Pretty good undermake-up. Haven&#x27;t been using long enough to notice the anti-aging properties but I&#x27;m satisfied with it and would recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin was a DISASTER. I was desperate -- Pimples, acne scars (from picking and popping pimples), large pores, blackheads, blotchy, dull, dry, sun damaged ...terrible skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to fix my skin through what seemed like a never ending process...was grueling (and EXPENSIVE) I imagine many women are going through the same frustrations - so I am sharing this review hopefully helping someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switching from hormonal birth control to IUD - my skin FREAKED out and looked even worse. Nasty cystic hormonal acne I never knew I had became the norm and I wasn&#x27;t willing to accept that. I caked on all the acne meds I could. Desperate to get rid of my pizza face, I applied the derm&#x27;s rx acne meds, benzoyl, changed soaps, used toners, lotions, vitamins, went gluten free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed up my routine so many times and still - struggled with blackheads, large pores, and ACNE. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next step, I went through fraxel laser treatments (OWW!), microdermabrasions, facials... you name it, I&#x27;ve done it! So much money, time researching science behind skin and products and NO RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through trial and error, I found retinol tabs like Perlabella. I cannot praise the effects of vitamin A on my skin enough:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it once a night after I washed my face then after a few weeks started using it in the morning and at night. I will stop for two months after I am done with my container (28 days worth) as suggested of retinol usage. My skin is GLOWING! My acne is NONEXISTANT! I am so so so so HAPPY! The stress, obsession, desperation and money draining efforts are over! Do this ladies. I promise you. You will be happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that my skin has improved solely from retinol, yet since adding it to my routine it has turned my skin into something I never imagined it could be. Clear, radiant, smooth, tight, plump and acne free. I included all the products I use with the retinol pearls below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Routine (all products you can find on amazon):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash Face in the AM and PM:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Perlabella Retinol Anti-Aging Face, Pure Dose Pearls&lt;br /&gt;- Lumene Finland Vitamin C+ Pure Radiance Day Cream Spf 15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Primer! (protects pores from being clogged by makeup)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash your hands before applying makeup with fingers/ hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disinfect your brushes! (Bacteria grows so easily on makeup brushes, use cheap baby shampoo to wash foundation brushes and soak powder brushes - once a week or so - before you go to bed with vinegar diluted with water for a few minutes - let it air dry overnight for the next morning)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blemishes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Derma e Tea Tree &amp; E Antiseptic Creme&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spot treat or apply all over (rub it in for best results)...it smells strong (like tea tree oil) but works and wont bleach any clothes/sheets.&lt;br /&gt;Throw away all the harsh acne spot treatments - They dry out your skin (causing more pimples) and bleach your sheets and towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamins:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Biotin 5000mcg&lt;br /&gt;- Evening Primrose Oil 1300mg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot of products and steps, but if you are serious about wanting \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; skin - you have to take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could upload a before and after pic. But try it yourself if you haven&#x27;t already :) - Amanda</li>
