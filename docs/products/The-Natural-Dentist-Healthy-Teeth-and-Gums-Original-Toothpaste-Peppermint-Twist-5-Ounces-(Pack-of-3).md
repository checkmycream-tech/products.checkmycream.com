    <li> I have been using toothpaste without Lauryl Sodium Sulfate for a few years. This has really helped control mouth sores. The problem is finding toothpaste. I&#x27;ve used a few different brands and recently tried Natural Dentist Healthy Teeth &amp; Gums. Wow, I&#x27;m very happy with it. I will definitely continue to use it. It leaves my mouth feeling more clean and fresh than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great. On top of the \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; aspects of it (which are great), I like that the toothpaste easily rinses off of the brush. A lot of pastes stay on it even after rigorously rinsing the brush.  I wish it came in a travel size as well.</li>
    <li> We have been using Natural Dentist for years our whole family is happy.  The dentist gives us great feedback, and the brushing experience is so much more pleasant without the detergents that attack your mouth!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was having a few issues with bleeding gums and sensitivity. I am not crazy about the taste so I use a dab of this and a dab of my other regular toothpaste by Jason. It does seem to help and I also have the Natural Dentist rinse, which is very good.</li>
    <li> Gentlest, best feeling, and freshest toothpaste ever. I picked a tube of this up at a local grocery store after getting my braces off- after years of inadequate brushing- and this rocked my mouth&#x27;s world.</li>
    <li> Tastes great and no nasty chemicals in my mouth.  I&#x27;ll stick with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent. If you like Tom&#x27;s but don&#x27;t like SLA - this is the toothpaste for you.  It&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Do you get excited about toothpaste as much as I do? Probably not. But if you&#x27;re looking for a non-SLS toothpaste that actually works and isn&#x27;t $18 a tube, you&#x27;ve arrived. It&#x27;s ok to shed a tear, I won&#x27;t judge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years.  I usually purchase at Whole Foods, but decided to try buying in bulk this time.  My one qualm is that they aren&#x27;t sealed for protection, and I can&#x27;t remember if the ones purchased in the store are or not.  I will have to do a comparison when I run out.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste contains a higher amount of fluoride, what the ADA recommends, than other natural toothpaste.  It also contains no SLS foaming agents to give you the look of a rabid dog, if you use an electric toothbrush.  I like the minty flavor, it&#x27;s not so minty it burns(my kids will even use it on vacation and don&#x27;t have to lug around an extra tube of [[ASIN:B001E767U0 The Natural Dentist Healthy Teeth &amp; Gums Children&#x27;s Toothpaste Gel, Sparkle Berry Blast, 5-Ounces (Pack of 3)]]), but gives you nice fresh breath that lasts quite a while!  I like to buy this in bulk, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste and glad it came in a 3-pack.  Good price too..</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever! Tastes great, all natural, no SLS unlike Tom&#x27;s. Been using it a year and love love love it!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a toothpaste with floride, but no nasty chemicals.  This toothpaste tastes great and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t contain sls. Price is very close to local whole food store so it saves the trip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine baking soda toothpaste and the Trader Joe&#x27;s knockoff (essentially the same) for quite some time, as I like a simple toothpaste that&#x27;s not sickeningly sweet, as most commercial brands tend to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a comparison article that included The Natural Dentist as one of their best, as despite the higher cost, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now, and I&#x27;m really pleased with it!

    <li> I recently loss some of my sense of smell and this affected my taste buds for some things, toothpaste being one of them. This has a nice taste to it and seems to work better the the over the counter brands.</li>
    <li> This is a great natural toothpaste.  Very clean ingredients list, pleasant taste, and whitens teeth.</li>
    <li> A fantastic toothpaste. I wish I could find it locally, I&#x27;d use it all the time.  I love the taste of the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Although the ingredients this toothpaste contains are not harmful as in other toothpastes, I&#x27;m not entirely happy with it. For starters, the consistency is quite thick and it&#x27;s difficult to squeeze from the tube. I have arthritis in my hands and have a difficult time squeezing it out. If the opening to the tube were larger, this probably would not be a problem. My other complaint is that the flavor is not at all refreshing. The taste is very bland and, after using it, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel refreshed as it does with nearly every other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. I won&#x27;t be reordering this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to brush with something that gets the same results as regular paste without the toxins. The flouride in here is not toxic so you get the best of all worlds. My teeth are white &amp; just from the dentist clean!</li>
    <li> wow, my teeth don&#x27;t hurt anymore and I don&#x27;t have a lingering bad taste in my mouth after brushing my teeth!</li>
    <li> Dental hygienist said my gums were super healthy today.  It does not burn my mouth.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Not great, not terrible.</li>
