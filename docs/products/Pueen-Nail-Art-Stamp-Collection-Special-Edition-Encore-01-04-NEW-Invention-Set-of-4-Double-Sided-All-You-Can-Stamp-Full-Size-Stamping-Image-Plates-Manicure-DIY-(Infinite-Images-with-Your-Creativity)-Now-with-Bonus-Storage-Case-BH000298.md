<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nail stamping plates were delivered right on time. I would give 5 stars but one of my plates was not etched deep enough,  so I cannot pick up the pattern at all :( they are very pretty.  And the plates that did work, worked great. I did cut them out of the plastic casings.  It was way to hard to clean properly.  The edges are very sharp, so be careful.  I do like the case it came in, it keeps it nice and neat for storage.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these nail plates. They are all very nice designs and they come out very clear. My packaging was less painful than what others had my plates were already cut out and ready to go. I can&#x27;t wait for more plates to come out. I would recommend this product everyone. My shipping also came before expected delivery. Awesome product! !!!</li>
    <li> very nice images and great packing ,i like that it came in like album or a book ,if you want to gift this to girlfriends it has nice packing ,came on time as promised by amazon........</li>
    <li> These plates got here fast and I like them a lot. Great images and crisp prints. I&#x27;m not crazy about the plastic around them. Hard to clean. But I&#x27;m happy I got them as a gift.</li>
    <li> I Love pueen plates. Images are so crisp and beautiful!</li>
    <li> This is so too bad, too  many of these images don&#x27;t pick up and transfer. The images are so pretty, but so fickle. I wonder if they are not etched deeply enough. I have checked around and other stampers feel the same as me. Sorry to say, a waste of  my money.</li>
    <li> LOVE. Was so excited when I got these I ran to the store and found a cheap nail set since my stamper isn&#x27;t supposed to arrive for another month or 2. Tried using the cheap stamping plate before I used these and it didn&#x27;t work, used these with the cheap stamper and worked beautifully first try! I am so so excited, these have amazing designs. The plastic around isn&#x27;t annoying to me but it was a pain to get the blue protective cover off. Mine do have scratches sadly but it didn&#x27;t affect me the first time I used them so that&#x27;s a relief. MAKE SURE TO BUFF STAMPER WITH NAIL FILE FIRST AND CLEAN STAMPER AND PLATE BEFORE AND AFTER EACH USE. I used an old subway gift card for the scraper and use thick thick polishes. Watch a video online and you can be a pro! I definitely need practice but not bad first time!</li>
    <li> I love these plates so much and the new way it is packaged it&#x27;s really cute and better than the old packaging! ! Thank you! ! Oh and really FAST shipping:)</li>
    <li> Several of the plates arrived scratched. One design has a mistake in the etching, there&#x27;s an area missing. Mine came in a case different than described in the listing. It&#x27;s a cute little album type book with plastic sleeves to store the plates. One of the sleeves on mine came already ripped. My plates are mounted on plastic, they don&#x27;t have the plastic frames that other reviewers mention, so maybe they have changed the design. The plates are not flat, they are curved on the edges. This makes using the designs near the edges harder to use because it&#x27;s difficult to scrape across them properly. There are a lot of nice designs on these plates, but in a lot of places there is a swirl or line from one design that goes across another. So for example say you want to stamp a section that&#x27;s a star design and there will be this one random line going through it. A lot of the designs are like that. Overall this set has potential, but it could be better. I think I am going to return it due to the messed up etching and the curved plates.</li>
    <li> Love this product! So easy to use and looks great! Doesn&#x27;t come with the stamper or scraper so you must buy it separately but it looks better than something you&#x27;d pay tons of money for in the salon!</li>
    <li> I love these plates! I have long nails and love that the designs cover my whole nail. The designs are very beautiful also and all of them stamp very well. I would recommend these to others.</li>
    <li> In love with these plates! For anyone who wants to know, this is the newer packaging and its amazing. Arrived on time and in great shape! These will get lots of love.</li>
    <li> Was packaged securely and arrived on time great quality item great images</li>
    <li> I have many different nail plates from u.k etc. And these are the ones I always go back to. There are so many designs to choose from.</li>
    <li> They are very nice, but the problems are all the plates are curved at the center and some are unglued from the white frame, so I can&#x27;t use all designs, I think I will buy another brand. :-(</li>
    <li> Beautiful designs! My daughter loves them and learned very quickly how to use them! The plastic foldout storage sleeves were ripped and in very poor condition on arrival. But if you can overlook that and keep in mind you aren&#x27;t buying them for the packaging--the plates themselves are beautiful and the stamp impressions are excellent!</li>
    <li> I love pueen. Nice quality plates and they work with pretty much any stamper. They also come in the cutest packaging.</li>
    <li> Great stamping plates love the designs</li>
    <li> I really like this...nice folio style.</li>
    <li> Love the designs...only problem is figure out color combo...</li>
    <li> Pleased with product good quality came quickly nicely packaged!!!</li>
    <li> Love these stamping plates. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t transfer to my squishy stamper well at all. There are usually large gaps in the pattern. When I use my smaller rubber stamper (like the pink Konad stamper only I can&#x27;t remember which brand) the transfer is flawless.</li>
    <li> They are pretty ;) but the problems are two of the plates are bowed/curved a little at the center and one of them came unglued from the white frame :( i guess i&#x27;ll just have to add more glue.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed these so much so many great designs love the flowers.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. Easy and simple to use. The only problem is.... Deciding what pattern to pick. If you love nail stamping as much as I do, this is a must get.</li>
    <li> Nice plates. My album came ripped on 2 envelopes, but I taped them up. Still wish they would have came in one piece, though. Overall, great looking plates.</li>
    <li> Amazing plates. So glad that they are the newer set that aren&#x27;t in the plastic sleeves and accordion style case. They are in the flip case with nice border. They look great and stamp great. A few of the sleeves to hold the plate were coming apart a little bit but  fixed that right up. Great deal and I&#x27;m so happy I ordered!</li>
    <li> The stamp is great but after having it for only a month it&#x27;s warping so bad it&#x27;s pulling away from the plastic backer.</li>
    <li> great plates !!!! love them all.</li>
    <li> I love the ideas that I can do with these. Once I figured out how to prime my stamper I had no issues picking up the images. There are so many varieties of images I can do with this set. The designs are endless. It also came in a cute little photo album sleeve.</li>
    <li> Amazing! The possibilities are endless!</li>
    <li> I give it three stars because the frame and case are terrible, also the plates are very thin and they arrived scratched already!</li>
    <li> Received my plates directly from Pueen, not Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;These plates are just lovely! I was concerned that the designs overall would be a bit large for my natural nails. This is not the case. They are of a size that will stamp well on any length, or size of nail. Images are well-engraved, with clear lines. I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems in picking up these images. There are usuable images on every area of the engraved plate.&lt;br /&gt;Deducting stars for as silly an issue as the packaging is just idiotic. Almost every stamper has their own storage system, and doesn&#x27;t use the factory included case. As for the plastic liner around the plates, many stampers in my Facebook group have removed it, and used Washi tape or patterned Duck tape around the plate&#x27;s edges. Again, deducting a star for this is just as idiotic. Deducting stars for what boils down to a personal preference in aesthetics is misleading, IMO. Pueen has provided a means to avoid cutting your fingers on a sharp edge,  and you can&#x27;t really ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> These plates are absolutely gorgeous!! So many possibilities. A must have.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! I found it almost impossible to pick up a single image from these plates. I tried 4 different stampers and a few different nail polishes and nothing worked! The packaging is terrible as well, the plates are extremely sharp and scratch very easily. Its such a shame because I was so excited to receive these. They are beautiful images, I just wish they didn&#x27;t suck so badly. What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> Some great designs, but unfortunately, some are not etched deep enough. I&#x27;m an experienced stamper and a few of the designs are so shallow that it makes no difference what polish or stamper you use. I still think it&#x27;s worth the money however.</li>
    <li> These stamping plates work!  I have a lot of experience with stamping and Pueen is awesome.  I have not had a single issue with any of the stamps that I&#x27;ve purchased from this brand.  Buy these!</li>
    <li> Nice fast shipping but only thing I didn&#x27;t like on this plates is the plastic frame</li>
    <li> Pueen did a fantastic job with these plates. The etching provides a crisp, easy to transfer image. Unlike the Buffet plates with their weirdly oversized images, these images are tiny and just right for stamping on nails. I have several MoYou London all over plates and in terms of placement and usability these are much better. Unlike the MoYou plates which are beautiful until you actually start trying to isolate areas to stamp, the designs on these plates logically flow into each other and offer a huge variety of workable choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not in love with the plastic rim shielding the sharp edges of the plates, and in fact had a hard time even removing the windows as they were not completely perforated and the edges tore in places. But I haven&#x27;t had any problems getting polish under the plastic frame, even when stamping designs in the corner. There is a decent amount of distance between the stampable part of the plate and the plastic. As long as you swipe away from the edge it really isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case that the plates come is really nice. The double sided plates seem gimmicky, but they work fine.</li>
    <li> Might have to return these. They&#x27;re not flat. They&#x27;re made of thin metal glued to a hard plastic card.On every single one of the cards... on one side the plate curves outward which is fine, but on the other side the plate dips inward, not fine. I can&#x27;t scrape evenly so essentially half of these plates are useless. Update: Ive had these a few months now and I REALLY wish I would have taken the time to return them. They arent glued properly.  The white cards are lifted on the side so paint get behind them and warps them even further. They are impossible to clean all the way because of this and I hate messy looking plates. I find myself having to reach for the same designs over and over again with these plates cause over half will not work because the plated are bent and with use they seem to get more and more bent. The quality of the metal is just so cheap and flimsy for what you pay. The case is cheap and falling apart. The gold leaf logo on the front has rubbed off. That’s not something I would expect from a product that is not used often and it stores nicely and cared for nicely. The quality is just not there. For this price these plates AND their case should be such better quality. Im not sure if I will ever buy Pueen again after this experience. I bought so many cheaper plated that don&#x27;t have this many issues.</li>
    <li> Love the stamping plates... There wonderful...</li>
    <li> I was surprised on how exact the delivery date was, and how pretty these designs looked in person they all came in a white packaged box with a silver fabric ribbon around it. The white package seems similar as a huge wallet and the plates are as big half of my hand size, I love it!</li>
    <li> These plates are awesome! they stamp amazingly and I just love them, a must have for all nail stamping addicts out there! The only con I have on this set is the packaging, I think they need to redo the packaging cause just don&#x27;t think will last long the sleeves that you put the plates in are very thin and think eventually will tear and also beware of removing the vinyl center cause they did not make it easy to remove took me at least 20 mins to remove the center to get to the blue film protecting the plate. But over all the plates are worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used them a few times now, and it is great!!  Well made, great intricate designs, each side is different..  works fine with the right polishes..  Have fun! It&#x27;s so addicting.. I&#x27;ve never tried before!  You can design your own nails quickly and are only limited by imagination!  I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t need 1/2 as much polish as they show in most Youtube videos... just a tiny dab to fill the tiny etching, then wipe, and stamp...  very fun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep them out of the box, since it&#x27;s kind of strange, the way they unfold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered pure acetone to clean the stamper and plates , I use non acetone on my nails..</li>
    <li> As far as the designs go, these plates are lovely!  The plastic \\&quot;sleeves\\&quot; around each plate?  A total pain to keep clean!  I ended up removing ALL of the plastic (just be careful if you do this, as the edges can be sharp).  The packaging is the only reason that I took away one star.  I LOVE Pueen products (I have all of their plates, along with a ton of their other products) and while this plate set is great, the \\&quot;frames\\&quot; are just silly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also silly to insult others for their own opinions on a product.</li>
    <li> These plates are awesome for nail stamping! I love creating my own designs. The only thing I was unhappy about with this product was the case that the plates came in. It seemed very very cheaply made or it had been used already. When I opened the case for the first time, the plates were falling out all over the place; there were holes in the plastic. When I looked closer, the plastic was torn in the back of the case and the plastic sheets fell out of the booklet. I would recommend buying a better case for them.</li>
    <li> Amazing plates. So glad that they are the newer set that aren&#x27;t in the plastic sleeves and accordion style case. They are in the flip case with nice border. They look great and stamp great. A few of the sleeves to hold the plate were coming apart a little bit but double sided tape fixed that right up. Great deal and I&#x27;m so happy I ordered!</li>
    <li> These plates are great for stamping! Period. The designs are perfectly proportioned for nails. They are well-etched, hold the polish well, &amp; transfer the polish AMAZINGLY well. I am a newbie to stamping &amp; have been told by numerous people - including 1 nail tech - that my nails were gorgeous...who did them?...were they stick-ons, etc? That being said, it took me quite a while to get them \\&quot;perfect,\\&quot; but that is because I am so new at this! I highly recommend these plates &amp; I have purchased several brands in the last month - even from the UK - and these are my favorite! What appeals to me the most about this collection is the variety and flexibility offered. There are some designs that require precision placement - ugh! - but good for practice. Yet there are so many others that allow for latitude with placement, yet still render a professional-looking result. Very satisfying for us OCD types!  ;)    I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but IMHO this collection is deserving!  Now - addressing the funky plastic sleeves / lack of backing / 2-sided issue. Yes, that is odd. Yes, I&#x27;d prefer 8 plates each w/ their own cardboard/plastic backing. However, IMO, that quirky inconvenience is immaterial to what these plates have to offer. Any Newbies out there? This would be a BRILLIANT initial investment!!</li>
    <li> I received my plates fast and they were packed well. I love the plates but FYI they will flex on you when you are using them. I placed a folded up paper towel under my plate and this helps the flexing problem while lifting your image from the plate. The designs are beautiful and I have used the plate many times over the last month. This set is one of my favorites. Well worth the money .....</li>
    <li> beautiful product. desings im so happy</li>
    <li> I purchased these as my first set of stamping plates and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  The designs are gorgeous.  I tested several of them and they all came out wonderfully except for one on plate 4B.  It could be my stamper for all I know, though.  I&#x27;ll have to get another stamper one day to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for anyone who was looking at reviews and were concerned about the plastic protective cover and the potential for the plates to fall out if the booklet was held upside down - no worries!  Pueen has heard the concerns and has changed the packaging.  The metal plates are now mounted on a thin plastic board rather than wrapped, and the case has been changed into a booklet style, with openings toward the spine so the plates can&#x27;t possibly fall out [unless one of your sleeves was sliced like mine was].  I felt the plastic felt a bit cheap, and the plates sometimes feel a bit warped and pop slightly when pressure is applied to the other side [i.e. they&#x27;re not flat], but this hasn&#x27;t been as much of an issue as I thought it might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall quite satisfied.  This will see lots of love from me.</li>
    <li> Love Pueen for their creativity in stamping plate designs, keep up the good work!! The etching is great &amp; the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relatively experienced with stamping.  I was so excited to get these plates.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t pick up a full image from them.  Sometimes I get absolutely nothing and other times I get a few pieces of an image.  At first I thought it was my stamper, so I tried another stamper.  Still nothing.  Hmmm, I tried different amounts of pressure when scraping and trying to pick up images.  Nothing worked.  I then went and tried my stampers on other, much cheaper, plates I already own and everything worked just fine.  Maybe I got a bad batch, I don&#x27;t know.  It sounds like other reviewers had a good experience.  Mine are being returned.  They are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, yes, the packaging is some of the dumbest I&#x27;ve ever seen, but I was totally willing to completely ignore that because I loved the designs on the plates.  If only I could get those designs onto my nails, I&#x27;d be a happy stamper.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Beautiful designs and great quality</li>
    <li> Great set to have in your collection. The images are very well etched and crisp.  Variety of images to make all types of designs. Quite amazing. I</li>
    <li> I love this set. There&#x27;s no more to say. When the Stamping Buffet was released, many complained (including me) that the designs were too big and that many of the details would be lost on the nails when we stamp them. You won&#x27;t have the same problem with this set. Yes, it has big designs here and there but that won&#x27;t give you the same problems the Stamping Buffet did. I tried this plate with my little sister, which have really small and short nails and we were both extremely satisfied with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparing the plates (removing the center pieces and the blue film) took me a little bit of time because the plastic case they are in is a little bit... inconvenient. But if you help yourself with a pair of scissors and/or a cutter, you won&#x27;t have much troubles nor will damage it while removing the center pieces. With really made me swear a few times was trying to remove the blue film. Trying to remove it from the sides with the plastic case in the way, trying not to ruin it it&#x27;s not fun, I&#x27;m telling you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But despite everything, I&#x27;m really satisfied with this set and if I&#x27;d have to buy it again, I&#x27;d do it without thinking it twice.</li>
    <li> These are great. Lots of potential designs and in a nice holder</li>
    <li> So many options to choose from and to play around with.  Its a nice set to have specially if you like doing you nails with different designs.</li>
    <li> Some of the images do not stamp well. Especially the rose outlines, they don&#x27;t seem to be etched deeply enough.</li>
    <li> Just got them and their lovely thanks so much</li>
    <li> I love the plates. It is the holder I have an issue with. I loved the fact that it came in the new style book, not the accordian style. But, when I picked it up out of the box I noticed a plate slipping through. On 2 of the sleeves, the seam has come undone. On one of them it is torn. This does not affect the plates at all, but be careful. The seller was Inbeauty through Amazon and I am not going to send back because I had to return some other nail plates from Cici and Sisi a few months back. Not worth the hassle. I just kept this because I needed plates and these are so beautiful.</li>
    <li> These are perfect. You never get the same stamp twice, I really like that. Every nail is unique. Great quality and very clear images.</li>
    <li> LOVE! so far all the designs i have used came out perfectly</li>
    <li> Wow, so amazing stamping, very nice and a lot of picture.&lt;br /&gt;But it too high prices.</li>
    <li> So many designs, so little time to do them all. Great stamping plates and lots of fun.</li>
    <li> Package came super fast. I was excited about that. The product itself I fell in love with. At this moment I do not have any complaints about the product.</li>
    <li> The plates themselves are amazing. BUT the case it came in... its dented horrible like its been squished a few hundred times. The ribbon to keep the case closed immediately snapped upon opening it. Which is why its missing a star. Not worth sending the whole set back for the case.. but beware</li>
    <li> They do tell you to peal off the blue coating, but I missed that at first. Once you do that, these are magnificent. And in no way cute. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Packaging is horrible. Not sure why Pueen did it this way.  As far add the plates I haven&#x27;t tried yet but they den to be etched well.</li>
    <li> Love the design perfect 10</li>
    <li> So Amazon is generally pretty great at selling cheap stuff that isn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34;  I purchased this image plate set and a cheap stamper set.  First off, the plates have some really cool engravings and I love the case it comes in.  This is the first night I have ever tried nail stamping.  It went well!  There were a couple of images I had difficulty with, but it was likely due to an improperly primed stamper.  The polish (konad so you know it&#x27;s good) wouldn&#x27;t lift on to the stamper.  After some trial and error I achieved most of what I wanted.  I see endless possibilities with these plates.  All in all I feel it&#x27;s a good buy.  Either experienced stamper or just a beginner like myself, these are pretty good.  The people complaining on here may not have properly primed their stamper or are using the wrong polish for the stamping outline.  Just keep that in mind when you read the reviews.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because there was an odd line from either a scratch or residual adhesive that I could not get off on one of my plates.  I have not tried stamping from that area just yet.</li>
    <li> These plates are fantastic!</li>
    <li> Loved them! I had no problems with the transfers.  Beautiful designes.  The only thing I did not like was the case they came in.  I feel like the little booklets that they have for the other smaller plates are much better. This one was awkward and my plates would fall out of the sleeves if I had it upsaide down, its hard to tall which way is up.  But I did not buy them because of the case so I am very happy with my plates.</li>
    <li> Great plates.  Images are unique, stamp and transfer clear and sharp</li>
    <li> These stamping plates are amazing.  Love the images and the flexibility to create such beautiful nailart.</li>
    <li> These are better than I expected and shipped super-fast. I have never used this brand before so I was pleasantly surprised when I used these the first time. The plates are covered with a scratch protector which is peeled off before use and they are packaged in plastic sleeves with a perforated area to punch out. However, the plastic sleeves are pretty much stretched out and ruined when you remove the punch out area to peel off the protective scratch cover. I just cut them out of the plastic sleeves and promptly cut myself on the sharp edge of the plate! My fault, that&#x27;s why they are in the plastic sleeves in the first place. The plates are stored in the little red pleather folder that they come in, which is nice. All in all, these stamping plates are great, many design combinations, and only lost one star because of the odd plastic sleeves.</li>
    <li> love the plates love the storage plate holders!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of Pueen stamping plates; this set is unique and lives up to my expectations in terms of quality--the images are very  pretty, they are crisp and sized well for short or long nails, and there is a lot of variety to work with. I have no complaints at all in that regard, and am very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 4 plates, each is double sided, so 8 sides all told. Each plate has about three times as much patterned area as one of the plates from Pueen&#x27;s Buffet collection, so you&#x27;re getting probably the same amount of workable imagery despite the fewer number of plates, so it equals out the same. I don&#x27;t, however, like them being double sided; it&#x27;s gimmicky and serves no purpose. Perhaps it&#x27;s cheaper for the manufacturer, but it doesn&#x27;t benefit the buyer in any way that I can tell. If anything, it makes packaging a major hassle, which is my only real complaint about the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates come in a fold out series of sleeves, and each plate is sealed into a plastic frame that isn&#x27;t supposed to be removed, as the edges of the plates are very sharp. But polish gets smeared under the edges when you scrape, and makes clean up a pain. It&#x27;s a convoluted mess; if they&#x27;d just made 8 plates with paper backing like they&#x27;ve done with the smaller round plates, there would be no issue. As it is, I think this silly packaging is what has contributed most to the higher price tag on this series, as compared to  their earlier sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I like the set and would recommend it to other stamping fans.</li>
    <li> On time , amazing set of stamping plates. Came with everything pictured</li>
    <li> I have MANY brands of plates, these are well made, great depth on the etching and love the quality of them. Highly recommend. Try the little Pueen pink stamper too. It&#x27;s not extra large but you don&#x27;t need xl unless you have very long nails. The stamper is slightly sticky and whenever I have trouble with a pattern that won&#x27;t stamp properly,  this stamper always gets it.</li>
    <li> I love this collection,  it has finely etched delicate designs as well as deeply etched bold lines. Arived in great condition, and before some of the ones who preordered from company.</li>
    <li> Nail clients love these</li>
    <li> Stamps beautifully! Love the images, so many to choose from! I took the plates out of the plastic cases, I kind of felt they are unnecessary.</li>
    <li> I love these plates you can do your nail without having to double stamp like some other plates. You can make your own designs.  I only used one plate so far just got them and they stamp great</li>
    <li> awesome prints! so glad I got this!</li>
    <li> Receive this as a Christmas gift and the seller told me they arrived faster than he expected.  The plates are etched well and I have not had any problems picking up images. They came in a red book holder, which was nice, except one of the pages in my book is just barely holding on at the top.  The plates have so much engraving on them that you can create endless designs on your nails, limited only by your imagination!</li>
    <li> The styles and designs are awesome and I&#x27;ve ordered Pueen products before and have been very happy. This time however, these pieces were slightly warped, which means they bend a little and make a snapping sounds, because they&#x27;re crooked. I&#x27;m hoping this was a one time thing because I would still like to get them. Also, when I returned the item, they don&#x27;t give you a full refund, like they charge you for shipping it back, but it&#x27;s not the customer&#x27;s fault that the product was defective.</li>
    <li> these are soooo nice! so many designs. they&#x27;re great..  I just find it a bit difficult to clean because the crevices are really small/narrow really gotta make sure you clean it well.  other than that these plates are great!!</li>
