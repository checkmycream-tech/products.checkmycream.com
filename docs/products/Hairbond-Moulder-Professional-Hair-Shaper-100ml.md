      <li>Although that is pretty awesome, let&#x27;s get to the product itself.</li>
      <li>The product itself is fantastic and it gives a great matte finish.</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>and it really makes his hair look and smell great!</li>
      <li>The product has a nice presentation.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and holds your hair in place.  </li>
      <li>A superior hairstyling product, and in fact, the best I have personally used.</li>
      <li>this is by far the best hair product i ever used!</li>
      <li>Just make sure to get a nice spray that suits your hair to hold it afterwards.</li>
      <li>This is by far the simplest &amp; best looking hair product I&#x27;ve ever put on my head.</li>
      <li>Very cheap material and for the price of $30</li>
      <li>Strong hold, matte finish, nice aroma.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>So I decided to follow the hype and purchase this &amp;#34;award winning product.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Recently, I splurged and had a pro razor cut my hair into one of those undercuts, and this brought out the best of it.</li>
      <li>Perfect if you want that European look (David Beckham, David Villa, Miguel Velosso, Gerard Pique, Zayn Malik look), for hair tutorials I recommend going on youtube and looking up \\&quot;mhrrasmus\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you get this, make sure you &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; it with another product to compliment the effectiveness.</li>
      <li>If your hair is longer you may want to consider something more emulsified.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My inclinations were mostly correct.</li>
      <li>I love the Hairbond.</li>
      <li>LOVE it</li>
      <li>At $24 I would hope to have a better quality product.</li>
      <li>It smells outstanding.  </li>
      <li>Currently, I use it to keep my bangs up that perfect amount when I comb my hair</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The smell is overwhelmingly vanilla, nut.  </li>
      <li>This stuff has good hold, decent control, and a nice matte finish.</li>
      <li>Holds hair great also smells a lot more pleasant than other name brand hair products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>New to pomades/waxes and found this product and saw the great reviews and decided to try it out.</li>
      <li>I like the design of the product and overall its not a bad product, smells great and holds fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>and this product was able to give me a smooth hold and keep my hair together and not have a hard/stiff gel look.  </li>
      <li>Washes out easily as well.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s easily washable.</li>
      <li>hair is easily held by Suavecito, Dapper Dan, and Redken.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it is easy to work through the hair and easy to rinse out.</li>
      <li>description says it washes out easily which it does not.</li>
      <li>It provides a strong hold with matte textured separation finish.</li>
      <li>Strong Hold</li>
      <li>Holds hair in the perfect style all day without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, so anything that bonds my hair together is unusable; Moulder literally separates each strand and then lets you not-so-perfectly piece them together</li>
      <li>when I opened it, I knew this product was going to be a huge</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic too.</li>
      <li>I really wish I liked this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smell: Another reviewer of this product gave this a 1 star as well and said that it smells like a cheap, $2-$3 product that you buy from CVS or Walgreens.</li>
      <li>it was fantastic.</li>
      <li>I enjoy their Quicksand product</li>
      <li>This works best for thinner/straighter hairstyles (as do most hair products), but plays alright with curly, wavy, or thick hair as well.</li>
      <li>It was very smooth and soft, which made it very easy to work with.</li>
      <li>but well worth it!  </li>
      <li>Most companies are trying to be a bit more environmentally conscious.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, Has a fine finish without having that unwanted shine that most products give.</li>
      <li>But I was hoping for something special.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, and this is the only one that meets all my requirements - good hold, no shine, and not so sticky that it pulls my hair out when I put it</li>
      <li>Molds like a dream and the scent is not bad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll make sure to not purchase from this particular seller again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Meh. Doesn&#x27;t really hold up my hair that well.</li>
    <li> A superior hairstyling product, and in fact, the best I have personally used. I made this purchase based off of the number of other positive reviews and I agree--I&#x27;ll probably never use a different product again.</li>
    <li> Great texture, although hold is low, all you need is a little hairspray and your good.  Best product ive had in a while.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best hair product i ever used!</li>
    <li> First time i purchased this item it was fantastic. It was very smooth and soft, which made it very easy to work with. After purchasing it the 2nd and 3rd time, the items i received were very hard digging into it and clumpy when i was rubbing it in my hands</li>
    <li> When I got it, it was hard to get out of the jar. I had to heat it up with my blowdryer...no. Then when I was able to apply it to my hair it dried my hair out, causing it to break off. I will not order this product again. I will forever be loyal to Bumble and Bumble thickening creme.</li>
    <li> After seeing all of the video reviews and rants and raves of this stuff online, I decided to cave and buy a jar. I have been exclusively using Hanz De Fuko products for the last several years. I enjoy their Quicksand product but it dries out my hair a bit too much. The Moulder by Hairbond sounded like it would have the exact same effects of the HDF Quicksand, without the drying effect, hence my decision to purchase. My inclinations were mostly correct. This stuff has good hold, decent control, and a nice matte finish. It leaves my hair a bit more sticky than I&#x27;d like but the re-manageability of it after the initial application is pretty uncanny and allows for different styles throughout the day. I have pretty thick, wavy hair and I keep it at a medium length and the Moulder doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all. My only gripe is with the packaging. It&#x27;s 2013. Most companies are trying to be a bit more environmentally conscious. The jar that the product comes in is wholly excessive considering the amount of product that you get. That being said, the HDF will still be my go-to, but I&#x27;m happy to add the Hairbond Moulder to my rotation.</li>
    <li> I really wish I liked this product. After watching many a video deigning to dub this product the &amp;#34;holy grail pomade,&amp;#34; I finally indulged and made the jump. Sadly, this product doesn&#x27;t do what I want it to, at all. Perhaps if I had standard caucasian hair, it&#x27;d work. But I have thick asian hair that has a hard time with anything matte, as it makes it stiff. I&#x27;d been trying to get the James Dean hair down, and this product just makes my hair insanely poofy and not very cute. I shall be updating this review after several haircuts and attempts, but if your hair already has a hard time being swept back, this will make it worse. Although if you have wonder hair that does whatever the hell you want it to, I&#x27;m sure this would be perfect for you. Alas, on to the next.</li>
    <li> Bad stuff, it developed dandruff and that for sure. Never use it product unless you wash your hair the same day you use it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my hair clump in much larger groups than gel or hairspray.  It smells outstanding.  And it&#x27;s easily washable. Boom.</li>
    <li> The Product arrived in good shape. It looks absolutely amazing except there was a small glass chip on the product that is noticeable. The product itself is fantastic and it gives a great matte finish. Besides the little chip, it is a great product. It is also alot of product and its bigger than you expect.</li>
    <li> This will only hold your hair in place when it&#x27;s on the shorter side, after it grows out for about a month, it will be almost like you put nothing in your hair at all. I have very thick hair though, and A LOT of it. Overall, this is one of the better hair products out there, but for the money, you can do better. The product is also VERY tacky and can be somewhat difficult to work through completely dry hair. I have to say though, the packaging and smell is absolutely phenomenal! If you get this, make sure you &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; it with another product to compliment the effectiveness.</li>
    <li> It is a good production! I am very satisfied with it. My hair is soft, and this one work well.</li>
    <li> gives it the volume i was looking for and holds through out the day it also gives hair an attractive smell</li>
    <li> I absolutely HATE writing this review because I wanted to like this product so bad but people need to be aware of these concerns before they spend $30+ on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been collecting(if you will) hair products for well over a year now from many different designers and lines. I purchased the Hairbond Toffee a few months back and didn&#x27;t like the product at all.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I was going to buy By Vilain Gold Digger but for one small can of wax the grand total was $35 and they ship from Denmark so I wouldn&#x27;t be receiving for weeks; not at all worth it. So I decided to follow the hype and purchase this &amp;#34;award winning product.&amp;#34; Right when I opened it and I mean RIGHT when I opened it, I knew this product was going to be a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Another reviewer of this product gave this a 1 star as well and said that it smells like a cheap, $2-$3 product that you buy from CVS or Walgreens. Let me start the critiquing of this product by letting you know that it indeed DOES smell exactly like a cheap product you buy from CVS or Walgreens. Absolutely horrendous artificial apple/chemical smell that I cannot stand. Gives me a headache within the first 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: What I&#x27;m about to say is something I say in all of my reviews of hair products. There is NO SUCH THING as a men&#x27;s hair product that is not a gel that offers &#x27;extreme hold.&#x27; It doesn&#x27;t matter if you have thick, thin, curly, straight or wavy hair; a product by itself without any hairspray/holding spray WILL NOT HOLD. So obviously this product has barely any hold and will keep your hair style for about 15 minutes before it starts falling down and losing volume. So I will knock almost any product that claims to have high hold because if it isn&#x27;t a gel, it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: The texture of this product is very weird. It feels as if it was made in a 3rd world country. Very cheap material and for the price of $30 this is ridiculously over-priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quantity: This product has the standard quantity of any men&#x27;s hair product but can sometimes require a bit more than your average product. Unless you&#x27;re Bill Gates, this product is not worth $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Was EXTREMELY disappointed with this product. Based on the very constant and consistent praise, I expected this product to be one of my new favorites. Now, after two uses, it will sit in the back of my bathroom cupboard collecting dust and will never be used again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S: For those of you with experience in Men&#x27;s Hair Care that are thinking about giving this one a go, mark my words; you WILL be disappointed.</li>
    <li> great product, used others like Crew. prefer this over Crew and others.</li>
    <li> Molds like a dream and the scent is not bad. Just make sure to get a nice spray that suits your hair to hold it afterwards.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used hair product other than gel or have had mixed results, Hairbond Moulder is a great place to start. A lot of people will complain about various hair products because they don&#x27;t know what kind of hair they have, and end up using the wrong product for their hair or too much of that product. Hairbond Moulder is great because it&#x27;s quite flexible. My hair is thick and wavy (though I often straighten it), but the Moulder still provides a great deal of separation and hold. It gives similar results to American Crew&#x27;s Fiber while being even more manageable and pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to note about this product:&lt;br /&gt;- This works best for thinner/straighter hairstyles (as do most hair products), but plays alright with curly, wavy, or thick hair as well. If your hair is longer you may want to consider something more emulsified.&lt;br /&gt;- You will need to use shampoo to really get it out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;- The price tag is really quite reasonable for how much use you can get out of one jar.&lt;br /&gt;- It has a delicious granny-smith apple smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it does I was pleasantly surprised by Hairbond Moulder, and am really looking forward to trying some of their other products. My only real complaint is that the plastic packaging, while cool looking, started to crack by the time I was finished with it. Not a big deal at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> So when I recieved the product and used it I found it to be completely dry and hard to work with. I watched some reviews and it looks like the one I got had dried out. I dont know if it&#x27;s amazons storage or a bad batch...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Kind of heavy in the wallet but I find myself coming back to it time and again. Couldn&#x27;t imagine going back down to an inferior product.</li>
    <li> Like a few of the others that ordered this product my Hairbond Moulder arrived completely dried up I had to really dig into it to get a &amp;#34;chunk&amp;#34; of it out of the jar. I rubbed it in my palms and then put it in my hair. It felt very similar to putting Elmer&#x27;s glue into my hair. My hair stuck to my hand and made a giant mess. I tried to work with it the best I could but it just didn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;ll try to order it directly from Hairbond next. Product was purchased from &amp;#34;Etailz&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll make sure to not purchase from this particular seller again. I am returning the product for a refund. But now I have to make an extra trip to the UPS store. What a pain, it seems to defeat the point of buying things online.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t try to do my hair&amp;#34; look, then this is the way to go. Perfect for people who want to style their hair like Zayn Malik.</li>
    <li> Good for a hair a little bit long. The product has a nice presentation. I recomend it. Good Luck bye.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair holding product with a Matte Finish. I have straight hair and it allows me to shape it anyway I want and hold all day.</li>
    <li> I love this hair moulder, i use it every day to style my hair and it always comes out perfect. I&#x27;ve been using this styler for a while and i always purchase it after i run out because it never fails me.</li>
    <li> This stuff does the job well without making my hair too stiff or clumpy.  It&#x27;s kinda likke adding just a bit of oil to your hair without it feeling dirty.  I don&#x27;t use it when my hair starts to get long thoiugh.  Otherwise highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Pricey but well worth it!  Holds hair great also smells a lot more pleasant than other name brand hair products I&#x27;ve used.  Adds a lot of volume and texture! Fantastic hair product and would recommend this over anything!!</li>
    <li> Mine came in dry and i dont know if i can still use it</li>
    <li> I like the design of the product and overall its not a bad product, smells great and holds fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;What you should know:&lt;br /&gt;Waxed based so if you put it on when your hair is wet there is an instant slip and stick reaction.&lt;br /&gt;The description says it washes out easily which it does not. Even after two shampoos and no reapplication you can still feel the waxiness in your hair. On the plus side you probably only have to reapply every other day since there is still product in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a more creamy/pasty solution so this is the opposite of that.&lt;br /&gt;Hold power is probably 3/5 as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really just American Crew Fiber for the UK.  It&#x27;s good...as good as Fiber.  But I was hoping for something special. Eufora Hero Texture Putty is stronger and cheaper.</li>
    <li> Hair bond is a great product. Smells great! The texture is very hard almost felt like it was a little too sticky and to much product will just flat out make your hair stand straight up. Works best when I combined it with another paste. But I will defiantly buy again for when I have shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Holds up hair for long time but my problem is it has alcohol other than that it smells great and it&#x27;s something I would recommend</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, too much of it will make your hair greasy. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair very pliable, holds well .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good on damp. Blow dry after. Good for undercuts and thick hair. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Works great, has a really good matte finish, but if you want more hold get the toffe hairbond moulder 8)</li>
    <li> Hello, my name is Caleb and I purchased the Moulder by Hairbond about six months ago and I am barely half way through the product. This stuff comes in a huge jar that will fill up your whole palm. Although that is pretty awesome, let&#x27;s get to the product itself. This product is one of the best smelling products that I&#x27;ve ever used. The smell reminds me of pineapples. This product will boost a lot of volume and create texture in your hair. This product will work for almost any style because it also has great hold. I apply a small amount in my wet hair and then blow dry to create a foundation for my hairstyle. When I am finished blow drying, I have a lot of volume and texture in my hair. I will then add a little more for more hold throughout the day. I give this product a five out of five stars because it smells great, it holds your hair all day, and it provides a lot of volume and texture.</li>
    <li> I was previously using Bedhead Matte Separation and this stuff blows it out of the water. It creates a total dry, natural look with no shine at all and still gives the ability to sculpt whatever style you like. The Bedhead, if you put too much on will create some unwanted shine in my hair, and feels much stickier. I love the Hairbond. It smells fantastic too. Of course, it stinks that it&#x27;s more than double the price of the Bedhead, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually bad at distinguishing differences between types of products, but this was a no brainer.</li>
    <li> The Hairbond Moulder is the best hair product I have used. I am known for my good hair, but I was getting compliments on how my hair looked even better than usual after the first time using Hairbond Moulder. The smell is fantastic and it is the first product that gives me the desired texture and hold to my hair. I paid as much for the shipping to the US as the product costs, but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hug Hairbond fan BUT the moulder did come a little dried out and leaves flakes in hair (probably due to the dried out). The &amp;#34;Shaper&amp;#34; product they make is the way to go. I&#x27;ll stans by that one.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used!!! Highly recommended, Has a fine finish without having that unwanted shine that most products give. This stuff also last forever and worth every dollar spent on it</li>
    <li> I change my hairstyle somewhat frequently so I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products over the years.  Hairbond Moulder is a product that performs exactly as advertized.  My hair is somewhat curly/wavy and sometimes I have trouble getting it to hold straight, but not with the Moulder.  Currently, I use it to keep my bangs up that perfect amount when I comb my hair w/ a side part.  I&#x27;ll also use it all over when I&#x27;m going for the quiff look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips on usage though: a little goes a long way.  My hair is fairly thick so sometimes I need a little extra pomade or wax, but not with the Moulder.  Start with a little then add a little more if you need it.  Second, make sure you rub it all the way into your fingers/hands before applying it.  Also, your hair must be completely dry or it won&#x27;t work (just clumps up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is one of my favorite/go-to products.  Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.B.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically review products, Hairbond is the exception. This is by far the simplest &amp; best looking hair product I&#x27;ve ever put on my head. Recently, I splurged and had a pro razor cut my hair into one of those undercuts, and this brought out the best of it. I have fine hair, so anything that bonds my hair together is unusable; Moulder literally separates each strand and then lets you not-so-perfectly piece them together however you please - it never becomes over worked. The end result is a deviously matte, textured &amp; luxe work of art.</li>
    <li> This product performs exactly as intended. It allows your hair to do whatever you want while still giving a very natural look. Best product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> It has a great scent, but that&#x27;s all it has going for it.&lt;br /&gt;I used this stuff about 7 times and each time it was terribly difficult to work into my hair. I even tried it damp, but it did not hold. Yes, I warmed it up between my palms with the same result.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is easily held by Suavecito, Dapper Dan, and Redken.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great styling product and works 100% to help shape your hair,the container is very nice, like glass,definitely makes a world of a difference,its totally worth it</li>
    <li> I have flat semi striaght hair. This product works very well with my hair. It provides a strong hold with matte textured separation finish. Perfect if you want that European look (David Beckham, David Villa, Miguel Velosso, Gerard Pique, Zayn Malik look), for hair tutorials I recommend going on youtube and looking up \\&quot;mhrrasmus\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products I recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanz de Fuko Sponge Wax: Matte textured finsh, although not completly matt, (gives a little natural shine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Menkoi Matte Wax: made from organic products, Matte finish, gives hair volume, texture hard to find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bed Head Matt Wax: Matte textured fnish, flexible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ByVilain: Strong Hold matte finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hairbond Toffe Shaper: similar to the moulder, differences are that Shaper provides stronger hold and is not completely matte, adds a little bit of natural shine</li>
    <li> This hair product is perfect for me!  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, and this is the only one that meets all my requirements - good hold, no shine, and not so sticky that it pulls my hair out when I put it in!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair is shorter, this will keep my hair in a messy upward look.  When it&#x27;s longer, I use this to add volume and side part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You an add this to hair wet or dry.  I usually add it when it&#x27;s still slightly damp.  The product gives my hair a healthier look when put on wet, and keeps my hair soft. I can run my fingers through it afterwards without feeling any resistance and it still keep it&#x27;s shape.  When you put in in dry, it will feel sightly more stiff later and not as smooth if you run your fingers through your hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Strong hold, matte finish, nice aroma.</li>
    <li> The product came on time and was as advertised.  Purchased for my football playing son.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff and I am telling you if you have thin hair this will puff it up for you without the wet 90&#x27;s look. It also smells great. I used a pea size of this and it lasts ALL day long. LOVE it</li>
    <li> This was for my son.  He&#x27;s been wanting it for a while. . he thinks it&#x27;s great and it really makes his hair look and smell great!</li>
    <li> It is pretty sticky and difficult to distribute in dryer hair.  The smell is overwhelmingly vanilla, nut.  That would have been good to know.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Best shaper and pomade I have ever used. Not greasy and gives great hold and creates fullness. It smells good as well.</li>
    <li> My son loves this product can not go a day without it. Holds hair in the perfect style all day without weighing it down. Washes off without leaving any residues.</li>
    <li> Received as expected.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get to me but boy what an excellent product. Great hold and flexibility. Washes out easily as well.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and holds your hair in place.  I have long blond surfer hair and this has just enough hold while looking natural to keep it out of my face.</li>
    <li> New to pomades/waxes and found this product and saw the great reviews and decided to try it out. First off, it smells awesome and goes on matte finish, almost like having nothing on. Holds really well and makes it easier to achieve any style you want. I needed something that wasn&#x27;t greasy looking and made my hair clump up which looks terrible. I learned that the hard way after using these other terrible products. Even after a few days, I swear by this product and probably won&#x27;t use anything else. If your looking for a natural looking hold this is your product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if Amazon has this stocked up with 10-year old hairbond, but it arrived very hard and dried. Disappointed, to say the least.</li>
    <li> Styling: 0/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3-inch-long thick hair and usually with matte waxes my hair has hold but remains manageable/shapeable throughout the day. However, while the Hairbond Moulder had hold as advertised, it does not offer good texture or manageability. Perhaps because of the cheap quality of the wax, my hair&#x27;s texture was left very dry and frizzy instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: 1/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product feels cheaply produced and has a very plasticky texture. At $24 I would hope to have a better quality product. The product also has a fruit smell (watermelon?) that made it feel like one of the lower-end (supermarket) hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Care: 0/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller with my issues and they told me that they were not responsible and that I should contact Hairbond corporate instead. I wrote an email to Hairbond.co.uk with my issues and requested a sample of another product (willing to give them another shot) but I never received a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Cheap quality, weird smell, zero customer care, and worst of all it doesn&#x27;t style well.</li>
    <li> the best hair moulder</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but its true to the description and is good for holding up my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I would purchase one of these every 2 months for about a year and got my friends hooked on it too, but the last few times that I did order it came out pretty dry. They should keep better quality control especially for $24 a jar.</li>
    <li> The moulder is great for a matte finish with medium hold. it is easy to work through the hair and easy to rinse out. The smell is fantastic like juicy red apple. I like to combine a small pinch of the moulder and the shaper  together to get a stronger hold and achieve a different look. I use the shaper as an everyday use and it gives my hair a tighter hold with the look of product in my hair. I use the moulder for a more natural dry look where it doesn&#x27;t look like product is in my hair. When i combine them i find a perfect combination of both.</li>
    <li> very dry stuff. its good if you like your hair to look like you don&#x27;t have anything in it. but ive noticed it leaves white residue making it look like you have dandruff</li>
    <li> I had read an article online praising this product so I hopped on Amazon to see what all the fuss is about.  I was skeptical at first seeing the price but decided it would be worth a shot to see how it would effect my hair.  I keep my hair slicked back and keep it at a 6 to 7 or 8 length but sometimes will go as low as a 4 1/2 and this product was able to give me a smooth hold and keep my hair together and not have a hard/stiff gel look.  Everyone has a different hair texture so everyone will have different results but this definitely worked out well for me and I would have no problem recommending this anyone.</li>
