<li> Arrived sealed, but with missing mirror inside and considering that I had a few of HIP shadows, it&#x27;s old and most likely expired, because of how hard the shadow is.</li>
<li> noticed several reviewers mention that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long--so keep in mind that is not going to be the all-day wear that you get from high end makeup, at least not by itself.</li>
<li> It goes on more like a powder than a cream, even though the texture is not completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally disappointed at how little of the eyeshadow is actually included in the container, as it may be a bit misleading.</li>
<li> I actually wore them for years, but turns out they made my eyelids raw most of the time, which was painful!</li>
<li> I am black with fairly dark skin (think somewhere between milk and dark chocolate, but closer to milk).</li>
<li> and the colors are fairly subtle on my skin, but just add that little bit extra thing you want when you&#x27;re going out or to an event or something.</li>
<li> The bottom portion of the package is hollow, with a small applicator (padded brush) inside.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores now, I&#x27;m not sure of it&#x27;s been discontinued but worth the buy!</li>
<li> so you should add it kinda heavy</li>
<li> I use a primer (urban decay) and I layer an creamy neutral base shadow (smashbox) underneath, and then use this product over it, to give a little extra color and dimension, and it lasts 12+ hours.</li>
<li> Products made specifically for touch-ups tend to be a flat color and often have a bad smell.  </li>
<li> I bought this a Walmart a few years back, and was disappointed to find that they stopped carrying it!</li>
<li> I so sorry for that</li>
<li> No more painful eyelids!</li>
<li> but I have had really bad experience with Amazon sellers selling</li>

    <li> It was great everything I expected!😊</li>
    <li> I loved these shades - the orangey copper color worked perfectly with my skin. I actually wore them for years, but turns out they made my eyelids raw most of the time, which was painful! Beauty is pain, right? I thought so for several years and continued wearing them, but eventually switched brands and haven&#x27;t looked back. No more painful eyelids! But if you don&#x27;t have sensitivity to certain shadows/makeup, these are great.</li>
    <li> The package alone shows thought!  The applicator brush is in the bottom of the container, so it can&#x27;t be lost!  The colors are intense and attractive, I am a red head and this and the green color in the same line are extremely attractive!</li>
    <li> great colors, great pigmentation. really is metallic looking. so great for a more naturally bold look. i love these duos</li>
    <li> I try to en corporate this color with a lot of my looks. Love the burnt rust color great color pay off and lasts a while even on my greasy lids.</li>
    <li> I like to much l&#x27;oreal cosmetics but this product is not the same color of the picture I so sorry for that</li>
    <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s so shimmery and the colors are fairly subtle on my skin, but just add that little bit extra thing you want when you&#x27;re going out or to an event or something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I was able to find these again my local walgreens discontinued the item. . Just like I remembered stays on all day and it true color is awesome</li>
    <li> Charged is beautiful it really makes my blue eyes look more intense and the metallic finish gives it a sheen that doesn&#x27;t look sparkly. Richly pigmented can easily due a chocolate/bronzy smokey eye with this. I have used several different brands of eyelid primers and it wears the same with all of them, doesn&#x27;t fade. I think this would look beautiful on any eyecolor or skintone. A neutral that&#x27;s not boring.</li>
    <li> I love the pigment of this duo palette, I use it whenever I&#x27;m wearing anything earthy or to blend in with a gold look. It is beautiful. I recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I get so many complements and questions about this product when I wear it. People assume it is high end makeup!  Beautiful color for cool undertones!</li>
    <li> I loveeeee this eye shadow. Im not big on any makeup besides eye makeup, and I absolutely love eye shadow, and especially this one. The colors are so pretty and i like shine so the metallic shininess is perfect for me. Also having the two colors makes it possible to do smokey eye with this which I love :) BUY IT</li>
    <li> A++, love the color, it wasn&#x27;t shattered and arrived fast. Would def buy again!</li>
    <li> I use this product to touch up my hair between henna applications.  The color is just perfect ... the combination of the two colors makes it look natural.  Products made specifically for touch-ups tend to be a flat color and often have a bad smell.  This product has no smell and does a believable touch-up job.  Thanks, L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> I bought this a Walmart a few years back, and was disappointed to find that they stopped carrying it!

    <li> It was as great as it was on the L&#x27;Oreal video. Shipment was Fast.</li>
    <li> I just bought this today in the Charged duo pack and I love it! I am black with fairly dark skin (think somewhere between milk and dark chocolate, but closer to milk). I have been looking for an eyeshadow that 1. shows up on my skin and 2. lasts for a while. I bought this and I am excited to say that it does just that.The gold and rust color are pretty vibrant and show up wonderfully. I have pretty oily eyelids so I usually put a coat of eye primer on first and it lasts for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to girls with darker skin looking for colors with some oomf and staying power.</li>
    <li> Have  not used it yet but the colours are gorgeous can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> nice color when used with a eyeshadow primer and  it shows up great it a light color so you should add it kinda heavy</li>
    <li> I am a dark skinned girl so this product showed up excellent on my skin. I gave it four stars because I wanted it to be in gold and this is more of a \\&quot;club/party\\&quot; color to me. But I do love it and I wear it occasionally.</li>
    <li> Arrived sealed, but with missing mirror inside and considering that I had a few of HIP shadows, it&#x27;s old and most likely expired, because of how hard the shadow is. I love these shadows but I have had really bad experience with Amazon sellers selling expired (uhhh, 10 years old) makeup and from now on I try to find it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Love HIP eyeshadow! I always get compliments on it. It&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores now, I&#x27;m not sure of it&#x27;s been discontinued but worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Yes, been using it for years and yes it met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> Love this line of shadow! So sexy &amp; stays on for hours (creases a little but I didn&#x27;t put primer on)</li>
