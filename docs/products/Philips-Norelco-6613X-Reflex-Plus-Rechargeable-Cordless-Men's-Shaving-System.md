      <li>(Be kind to your fellow bathroom users and shoot the heads with air cleaner in the shower before showering -- no whisker accumulation in the rest of the bathroom!)  </li>
      <li>recommend using a before-shave for best results - it really brings out the best from the shaving system.</li>
      <li>, it had been a pleasant shave each time.</li>
      <li>It gives closer shave and also the trimmer is perfect for trimming the sidebeards and trying out new goatees :D</li>
      <li>All in all a good buy.</li>
      <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good shaver for the price.</li>

      <li>This is Norelco&#x27;s most comfortable yet - and the best shaver I have used to date.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s best to time your charge at exactly 16 hours.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with the improvements made, and don&#x27;t really see a reason to get the $100+ shavers...</li>
      <li>It takes practice and time to become adept at using an electric shaver.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve learnt to keep my disposable razors handy, just incase.&lt;BR</li>
      <li>Maybe this would be a good razor if you are just beginning, but I&#x27;m returning this junk and buying something better.</li>
      <li>No unnecessary bells and whistles, just a great shave at a great price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that a shot of canned air duster over the inside of the razor heads before each use will greatly extend the life of the razor blades and you won&#x27;t feel like you have to take the blades out to clean so often.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Norelco for 11 months. I will make it clear right now that in those 11 months I have had no problems with it whatsoever, it had been a pleasant shave each time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are new to shaving with automatic shavers such as this one (like I was), the trick of shaving will come to you after a dozen shaves. Just do it slowly, pull your skin, don&#x27;t press too hard (only hard enough, you&#x27;ll find your limit). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend using a before-shave for best results - it really brings out the best from the shaving system. I use Lectric Shave.</li>
    <li> This is a very basic shaver.  A downside is that the shaver does not work with the cord in when the charge runs out.  A good thing is that the charge lasts over a week.  A downside is that the closeness is not adjustable.  It gets a close shave but not great.  The flexible heads are good.  I wish I would have spent a few more bucks and got a better shaver.</li>
    <li> very awkward design, very low power - first I thought the battery was low.. even after letting it charge over 16 hours as it says on manual, still nothing. Apparently, I am not the only one who had that thought. I have always been using Braun and just wanted to try Norelco since it was cheaper but it was a mistake. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. Do yourself a favor and buy Braun.</li>
    <li> Norelco shavers work better for me than anything else. Razors give me ingrown hairs/shaving rash.  So do other brands of electric razors.  When my old Norelco died after 8 years of daily use and much travel, I knew I had to buy another.  This is a basic model--fine for most of us--that shaves close and comfortably.  The only downside is the NiCd battery--you need to charge them properly to maximize the capacity and life.  That was the problem with my old one--too many hotel maids and small children unplugged it after a partial charge, etc., so that finally it didn&#x27;t hold enough charge to shave with.  When you first start shaving with an electric shaver, your face will need several weeks to adjust, but if you get shaving rash from your razor or current shaver, try a Norelco, they work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the first time user of a rechargeable cordless shaving system. Did not know what to expect from this product but went ahead and bought it since the price was pretty attractive( i paid about $30 including shipping). It&#x27;s a good product and i will recommend for any first time users like me.</li>
    <li> Horrible, horrible, horrible.  I have been a long time Norelco user, but after buying this model 1.5 years ago I&#x27;m fleeing.  Since then, I have had several days with vast swaths of uncut stubble on my face.  I have had to spend large amounts of time, going over the same area time and again, only to have it miss over and over again.  I end up using a disposable razor to catch all of the uncut stubble.  Also, after 1.5 years, the battery is toast.  I have to charge it every day now just to get 5 minutes of use each day.  It will not operate on cord alone--it requires hours of charging for 5 minutes of use!</li>
    <li> After using the Norelco 6613X for over two months, I&#x27;ve concluded that the Norelco shaves just as close as my Remington TCT 2 Microscreen razor and it is also a lot quieter.  Initially, I had to make a lot of passes in order to get the super close shave.  Not anymore.  I shave everyday and there&#x27;s no irritation whatsoever.  One negative thing about the Norelco though, the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Remington.  When I charge it, I would leave it plugged in overnight.  If I had to buy it all over again, I wouldn&#x27;t.  The Remington TCT 2 is cheaper (29.99 as opposed to 38.99 for the Norelco).  The Norelco took a long time getting used to.  The Norelco is bigger than the Remington, though it is also a lot lighter than the Remington.  If I had to buy a new electric shaver today, I would purchase the Remington TCT 2 microscreen shaver again.</li>
    <li> This Shaver is lighter than the Reflex model it replaced and is missing a few bells and whistles. It only has one light, not separate lights for low batterry and for charging/adequate battery.  It also does not have a very quick charging cycle, requiring 16 hours for recharges. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaving quality seems to be very close though. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> With a remarkably low noise level, and what are apparently slower turning blades than on my previous (6 year old) Norelco, this rather low priced model does a creditable job, although as has been my experience in the past, nothing shaves a close as a blade.  But then again, nothing removes the top layer of skin like a blade.  Easy to clean, and I although I shave 6 days per week, I have only been charging it up every other week.  In short, if it holds up for a year, for slightly more than the price of a replacement head, I have a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I want to comment on the service on receiving the item from Brand. Great service - received it in about a week. This was given as an out of town gift so arrived in plenty of time to ship the gift before Christmas.</li>
    <li> It has a cheap feel to it, and doesnt shave very well. When there&#x27;s more than a day&#x27;s growth, it pulls the hairs out instead of cuts them. Its like mini electric shocks that come at any time, not very fun to shave with. It gets the job done, but I&#x27;d go with a better model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Norelco 6613X now for almost 4 months and I&#x27;ve been amazed at how much I like it.  This is my first experience with an electric/cordless shaver and I&#x27;m impressed -- especially since it&#x27;s been such a good trade off from the disposable razor. &lt;br /&gt;The shave....Being of Nordic decent I really don&#x27;t have to shave everyday.  I&#x27;ve found this razor to work best on at least a full day&#x27;s growth or more.  I&#x27;ve also taken the advice of at least one other rater and started my very first shave with an electric shave lubricant, like \\&quot;lectra-shave\\&quot;.  You&#x27;ll find this razor shaves much easier when a lubricant is applied first and you&#x27;ll wonder why you haven&#x27;t tried an electric/cordless sooner.  No more cuts, nicks, bumps, or razor burn.  I haven&#x27;t so much as thought about a disposable razor since owning this one. &lt;br /&gt;As for cleaning.....I&#x27;ve found that a shot of canned air duster over the inside of the razor heads before each use will greatly extend the life of the razor blades and you won&#x27;t feel like you have to take the blades out to clean so often.  (Be kind to your fellow bathroom users and shoot the heads with air cleaner in the shower before showering -- no whisker accumulation in the rest of the bathroom!)  The manufacturer recommends a monthly cleaning of each individual head as well as oiling each head.  I&#x27;ve followed the recommendations and haven&#x27;t had a problem yet.  Pay close attention when removing the heads.  You&#x27;ll want to place them directly back in the same place you removed them or risk getting a pulling or tugging from the razor as opposed to a smooth comfortable shave.  It only takes about 15 minutes a month to clean and you&#x27;d most likely have to do this with any electric shaver. &lt;br /&gt;About the charge.....if you shave every day or even twice a day, you may have to charge this model more often than every three weeks that I  do.  With this particular battery, the manufacturer recommends that you give it a 16 hour charge initially and each time thereafter.  If you&#x27;ve ever overcharged a rechargeable battery, you know they don&#x27;t hold a charge any longer.  You don&#x27;t want to replace the rechargeable battery often so it&#x27;s best to time your charge at exactly 16 hours.  And, only recharge when the charge is completely exhausted.  If you worry that you won&#x27;t get a complete shave without the battery going dead, (has only happened to me once) start with your neck; by the time you&#x27;ve completed your neck you&#x27;ll know if there is enough charge left to complete your face.  If not, go scruffy that day.  A shaved neck with a scruffy face can look very appealing.  After your first full charge you&#x27;ll know when the battery is getting low.  I&#x27;ve even left my shaver running while I shower and get dressed so it can completely exhaust so I can have it fully charged by the next morning.  However, if you chose to just let it run to exhaustion, it will take longer than when pressed on your face.  It&#x27;s all about mechanics! &lt;br /&gt;The backside trimmer works well for trimming around the ears or sideburns, I guess....I have none.  I&#x27;ve had the back of my neck trimmed with it and it seems to work as well as the corded trimmer I&#x27;ve used for years and hasn&#x27;t seemed to dull. &lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great cordless razor.  I&#x27;ve never used a corded model so I&#x27;ve nothing to compare it to except the disposables.  But for less than $50, I&#x27;ll never go back to a disposable blade again.  Of course there will always be those who think nothing beats a bladed shave.  I say, use this shaver for at least 3 weeks -- and use it exclusively.  Treat your face like it is your finest asset -- It IS!!; meaning, a thorough washing with a sudsy soap and water at least twice a day and a water based moisturizer after each shave or shower. You just might find you can simplify your life and never, ever, use a styptic pencil or worse, toilet paper, (yikes!) to dry the cuts and nicks on your face again! &lt;br /&gt;Men,....Be good to your Face!   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This shaver sets the standard for quality at an affordable price. I have been shaving with expensive disposable shavers and thought I would give the electric another try. Well, after using this razor for the past two weeks I have no bumps or razor burn and I am a happy camper. Overall a great value for your hard earned dollar.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about 2 years and I agree with the review \\&quot;Guess-A-Charge!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;When I received this as a gift I had no idea that shavers were made that didn&#x27;t work when directly plugging into the power outlet.  I guess it wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if the shaver held a charge, but even then, what if you forget and you have no charge one morning?  Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to know you could just plug it in and have full power??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to what I said about holding a charge, mine doesn&#x27;t.  I get one or two shaves at full power and then another shave at half power..nothing like listening to your razor die while you are trying to shave.  It never held a good charge from day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After maybe a year the head assembly started falling apart when I took the top off to clean it out..nothing funner than fishing through the bathroom garbage for shaver parts, thanks Norelco!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;For those couple of shaves I may or may not get at full power I am happy, it cuts close and relatively quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sideburn/beard trimmer is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product has let me down big time..I guess I was spoiled by my old Philishave that was built like a tank, held a charge and could be used with the cord.  Did I mention it worked for 10 years!  This is proof they don&#x27;t build em like that anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: it finally died after 4 years and now I can buy something better. The recharge time was always awful and didn&#x27;t last, I will not miss this product.</li>
    <li> It woks but not very good. Bought a $100 razor shortly after this and WOW! what a difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money, get a good razor.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase. I bought the shaver for my dad and he complains that it pulls the hair and the shave is no where near smooth. I also tried it and I have to agree. I found that I have to make too many passes to get an acceptable shave. I have an old single head electric shaver that my uncle gave me...probably cost $10 and it gives a closer more comfortable shave. I think its more comfortable because it runs at a much higher rpm than the 6613X and it has be running on 2 AA batteries for months. &lt;BR&gt;The 6613X book said to use the shaver for 3 weeks before deciding. I guess I will have to wait and see if the shave does actually get better with time but it seems highly unlikely.</li>
    <li> This is Norelco&#x27;s most comfortable yet - and the best shaver I have used to date. I have owned Brauns and Remingtons as well as older, more expensive Norelcos and I will never overpay for a good cordless again. I didn&#x27;t expect too much for this one because it was less than half what I usually paid for shavers that usually only lasted 2-3 years tops anyway (for whatever reason - there were many). If this one lasts 3 years I will be very happy.</li>
    <li> It gives a very close shave and works better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of replacing the batteries in my old Norelco (and I mean 20 years old), so I thought I&#x27;d purchase a spare to get me through.  This unit had reasonable reviews and a reasonable price so i took the plunge.      Here&#x27;s the deal, if you&#x27;re looking for the heft and weight of your old Norelco, it ain&#x27;t here.  To cut costs, they made it lighter, less bulky and not nearly as \\&quot;substantial\\&quot;.  But that&#x27;s not the main point.  It shaves fine!  It holds a charge for a reasonable period of time (mines going on two weeks and no reduction in blade speed is obvious) and, let me repeat, it shaves every bit as good as I expected.      So, if you want to spend less coin and get a good shave, this is a great choice.</li>
    <li> After five years, it was time to ditch my old norelco... it pulled when I went too long without shaving, took about 10 passes to cut everything, and didn&#x27;t hold much charge as a cordless...&lt;br /&gt;Tried to buy a more expensive razor, it was out of stock, so I got this one.  I was really surprised at first how little irritation there was.  My old Norelco was giving a bit of irriatation in places, but no problems with this one, even though it was a new razor.  First time I used it was on 6-days growth, and there was none of the painful pulling I was used to.  To top it off, the shave was so much closer.  I really have no complaints about this razor... I&#x27;m very impressed with the improvements made, and don&#x27;t really see a reason to get the $100+ shavers...&lt;br /&gt;With the Norelco guarentee on top of the performance, I&#x27;ll be sticking with their products for another 5 years...</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for like 39 bucks.  I tried this razor for a month and half and I absolutely hate it.   First, the pop up trimmer is very cheap and does a lousy job. But most importantly, this electric razor is simply not powerful enough. I have to shave over an area three or four times and that leaves razor burn.  I find myself going to a disposable sometimes when this razor won&#x27;t cut after going over an area five times. Maybe this would be a good razor if you are just beginning, but I&#x27;m returning this junk and buying something better. NOT GOOD.</li>
    <li> This razor by Norelco is excellent.  I have had close shaves ever since I bought this a month ago.  Two of my senior leaders borrowed my razor when their electric razors broke and they remarked how good it was.  The only reason this is 4 stars is the lack of a power meter on this model.  While not perfect, I consider this to be a worthwhile investment.</li>
    <li> The product is good. First time I am using automatic shaver and I did not face any problem. It shaves very smoothly. The performance of battery is also good.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with the three floating head style shaver.  I am pleased with results.</li>
    <li> Great Close shave, Easy to use and better than many more expensive shavers. An excellent value for the money!!</li>
    <li> I do not recommend it because it not cut my facial hair at all. I prefer to use shick or mach 3 of gillete</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my fiance and he loves it! Says it shaves soooo much closer than his old razor and he can go longer without having to shave.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as the older norelco I had (12 yrs old, only the battery has worn out) but still cuts nice and the flexible heads are great. Definitly sold on Norelco - the screen style shavers are irritating and only last ~1 yr before needing replacement screens/blades.</li>
    <li> After several years of using a safety razor, I decided to return to an electric razor. After over a month of use, I am pleased with the performance of the razor. It was not necessary to recharge during a two week trip out of the country.  It is nice to be able to recharge using the European voltage (with a plug adapter).</li>
    <li> Nothing beats this... Great stoof, great price... nothing more you can ask for.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a gift last Christmas. I knew the whole Norelco line pretty well, and when I got this I thought it was the &#x27;Bottom Line Razor&#x27; However, I believe that this razor does such a good job, that if the price was 60, even 70 dollars, that people would pay it. It charges a Lot faster than the susposed 16 hours they say. It has the finominal tripple-blade cutting system, leaves no irration. It even comes with a cleaning brush, a convient travel case, a small and sleek charging unit, perfect for travel, and the most important part, the replacement razor units are very cheap (I&#x27;ve seen them under 8 dollars at WalMart) and their extremly easy to install. I think you will love this razor as much as I did, and If your looking into a Norelco-System, I think you should start your looking right here. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good electric razor if you want a solid product at a good price.  I purchased this razor in April of this year and it has worked great.  I bought it after my old Norelco razor stopped working after like 8 years.  I paid about $40 for this one and $100 for my other one.  Would I have to say that the old razor was better; absolutely but I expected it to given the price.  Overall this razor is solid, cuts the hair, gives no skin irritation, and keeps its battery life for a long time.  Overall I would recommend this razor to anyone.  If you want a better razor you will be paying at least $50 more.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT razor.  I bought it to replace my old Norelco because this razor didn&#x27;t cost much more than replacement heads for my old razor.  I LOVE IT !!!  Much more comfortable and a closer shave than my older razor (which I thought was great also).</li>
    <li> It has been a month. So far there has been no problem.  I had an old Norelco shaver.  I had to go over the same area over and over again.  With this one, I get a very close shave.  The noise is minimal.  No irritation (I have a pretty soft skin).  All in all a good buy.</li>
    <li> A great smooth shave even when I&#x27;ve not shaved for a few days.  This model is exceptionally quiet which means you can still hear music/ tv whilst shaving - although the sound is a bit similar to high pitched dental drill whinnings!!  The beard trimmer works fine.  It recharges well.  All in all, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and would not hesitate to buy it again.</li>
    <li> You know, I&#x27;m surprised this shaver was not better by the reviews.  I used to use my Dad&#x27;s very old Norelco shaver and I thought it cut great.  Then my gf bought me a Remington shaver 5 years ago that I&#x27;ve been using since that cut cleaner, but wasn&#x27;t as soft as my Norelco shaver.  So I decided to finally upgrade and I bought this shaver thinking it would be good.  Well it leaves too much stubble and the sideburn trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut that well.  Better than nothing, but not better than much.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth electric razor I have purchased in the past 2-3 years. It works. It doesn&#x27;t iritate my face and I don&#x27;t have to use a safety razor once a week to clean up the hairs it misses. &lt;br /&gt;Sure, it is not as close as a safety razor, and the battery last only 2-3 shaves instead of the week of shaves I was expecting. But, overall I am very happy and would buy another. &lt;br /&gt;The price was less than half the retail list and much lower than I could get locally. Worth going on-line for.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase, and I am trying to make another, but the funds are not here yet. I keep on watching for the great deals that Amazon has to give us all.Thank you again.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor 4 years ago, have used it every week since; I charge it every wednesday, toss it in the car, and use it all week! It has never failed, never run out of juice. Keeping it clean is a pain, and new blades cost nearly as much as a new razor, but it&#x27;s still way more cost effective than using disposables! Saves tons of time, money, and water!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase. I bought the shaver for my dad and he complains that it pulls the hair and the shave is no where near smooth. I also tried it and I have to agree. I found that I have to make too many passes to get an acceptable shave. I have an old single head electric shaver that my uncle gave me...probably cost $10 and it gives a closer more comfortable shave. I think its more comfortable because it runs at a much higher rpm than the 6613X and it has be running on 2 AA batteries for months. &lt;br /&gt;The 6613X book said to use the shaver for 3 weeks before deciding. I guess I will have to wait and see if the shave does actually get better with time but it seems highly unlikely.</li>
    <li> What I want is manufactured in Holland. But when I received my order, I was disappointed by the manufacture. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s cheaper than others sale on other website.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Norelco razor for several weeks now and have been pleasantly satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only need to shave once every other day, but the Norelco razor shaves just as close as my Gillette Mach 3 razors.  I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once so far, and it doesn&#x27;t wreak havoc with my face at all.  I&#x27;ve never really used shaver which costs over $100 before, and I&#x27;m not sure exactly what they can offer that this one can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any bells and whistles, but I really like how it works and am happy to be using it.</li>
    <li> ...had to finally pick up an electric shaver; have extremely sensitive skin, and more than often cut myself to shreds with a blade.  This electric razor has thus far proven very adequete; though it does not cut as close as a razor (takes a little more work...almost grinding the razor into the face), it satisfactory conducts a relatively smooth shave.  A high-quality shaving unit, at a reasonably economic price.  Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for a year and am buying another (not because it is broke).  Norelco suggests that you replace the blades once a year.  Replacement blades cost about 2/3 the cost of the whole shaver.  Therefore better idea to just buy another shaver once a year or so and rotate the old one to the travel bag, the office, the car, etc.  That way when one dies there is always another nearby.  The shave is decent.  I&#x27;ve owned better Norelcos with higher RPMs, however.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sure this one doesn&#x27;t have a charge indicator and uses the old type Ni-Cad batteries.  But just plug it in overnight once a week and you&#x27;re set.  I love gadgets and electronics, but do I really need charge indicators on a shaver?  Simplify and spend your $ on more fun things at Amazon :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband b/c he has three razors he uses in stages.  I was hoping to eliminate them all with this one.  however, he goes a few days without shaving and he said it pulled the hair.  it was okay once the hair was cut shorter (using one of the other, older shaver that he has).  so then i decided to try it on my legs since I spent the money and the box was torn up and in the garbage (i didn&#x27;t think i would be able to return it without the box).  I figured since leg hair is pretty fine, it would work sufficiently.  I guess it works okay if I wirl it in circles, but it doesn&#x27;t work good enough.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the 6613X. Get close, smooth shaves and charge lasts for at least ten day&#x27;s shaves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this razor since I bought about 4 months ago.  No unnecessary bells and whistles, just a great shave at a great price.</li>
    <li> great product, works great, no problems whatsoever...we have had it for over a year and my husband is hard on shavers, but it still works great</li>
    <li> Did you know? Even when plugged in, this razor will not work if the battery hasn&#x27;t been charged.&lt;br /&gt;How can an engineer consider that this will be a useful idea?&lt;br /&gt;My razor is PLUGGED IN A WALL and RECEIVING ELECTRICITY and YET they  managed to make it so it will NOT WORK if the battery isn&#x27;t charged. Of course the battery inside it will die and stop charging properly thanks to programmed obsolescence, leaving you in a few years with a completely un-useful razor.&lt;br /&gt;Again, WHY would ANYONE in their right mind build an electric device with a power cord that doesn&#x27;t work when plugged in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never buying Philips again, this just proves how little they think, and how much they don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;Really pissed that a mistake so simple and basic was made. Totally ruined the product.</li>
    <li> I am 55 and this is the first time that I am using an elecric shaver in my life! I selected the Norelco 6613X because it had the fewest complaints and/or negative remarks amongst all the shaver reviews that I read. No electric shaver, however expensive, can give a shave as close as a good manual razor. First-time users of an electric shaver should not make the mistake of judging it after the first couple of shaves. As mentioned in the user&#x27;s manual, it takes 3-4 weeks for a conventional shaver&#x27;s face and beard to adjust to an electric shaver. I am now in my third week of shaving with this Norelco 6613X cordless shaver and am getting more comfortable with using it. So how does the 6613X rate? Well, I have no major complaints at all. It gets the job done. I would give it a rating of 80% in terms of the closeness of the shave. And that should be good enough for a first-time user. I charge it when the battery is completely down, for the full 16 hours as recommended by the manufacturer. I shave every other day and this lasts me for 4 shaves at 7-8 minutes per shave. There are no fancy gizmos like dials to set or flashing LEDs. I have not had any cuts, nicks or scratches. It takes practice and time to become adept at using an electric shaver. It is very much like learning to ride a bicycle or drive a car. You get better and better with practice. Perhaps, after another 2-3 weeks of usage I might get a 90% close shave. There are many advantages in a cordless shaver. It is not messy. It is faster than a conventional razor shave. There is no up and down scraping of the face as in a conventional razor because an electric shaver has rotary cutters. The best part of a cordless is that you can take it with you and shave in your car or the rest room of your workplace in case you got up late and had no time to shave!!!</li>
    <li> Another ripped foil, so I finally relented and gave this Norelco a spin.  I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;ve gone out of my way to avoid this particular razor for the past 40 years--probably because of its dorky looks.  Face it, it&#x27;s just not very \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; in its appearance--more ovarian than phallic, more like the grail than the lance.  But if you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice form to function, this razor can&#x27;t be beat.  It&#x27;s the first one that caught every single hirsute strand on my neck in a single pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re beardless and unmustachioed, the Norelco is a bonafide no-brainer.  If you&#x27;ve got a number of hedges to trim around, the Norelco doesn&#x27;t give you as clear a view or precise a cut as a more conventionally shaped Braun, Remington, or Panasonic.  On the other hand, the pop-out trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen, perfect for weeding out, pruning, shaping those less accessible areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for spending fifteen to twenty bucks more for the next higher model (6843XL), the only difference I can see is color (blue instead of silver metallic) and a faster charging time (perhaps useful to those testosterone-rich individuals who require a shave every hour).</li>
    <li> My old Norelco cordless had finally reached the point where the charge was only good for about 3 shaves and then it would pull the hair more than cut it. This was after about 5 years of use though. I decided to stay with Norelco and try this razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First off this razor is much quieter than my old one. Secondly, the shave is very close and comfortable. No pulling or nicking at all. I am very happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> my bf really likes how this thing shaves, he said it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the ordinary razors, but it gets the job done a lot quicker. plus, no shaving cream is necessary!  yay!  the refills are a bit expensive though, almost half the price of the shaver. be sure to replace them about once a year, it&#x27;ll feel brand new again.</li>
    <li> I use it as a SECOND, back-up shaver for either travel or while I&#x27;m waiting for my regular shaver to re-charge. Inexpensive and lightweight.</li>
    <li> My review is based solely on the features and conflicting information regarding the product.  I just recieved the razor and after reading the manual, plugging it in and speaking with customer service, here is the scoop:&lt;BR&gt;The shaver DOES NOT work with the cord, only in a cordles mode (the Norelco web site states otherwise).&lt;BR&gt;The LED charge indicator only lights when the razor is charging, and doesn&#x27;t turn off when fully charged.  Basically telling me the same thing that looking at the cord plugged int othe razor would do.&lt;BR&gt;There is NO low battery indication in any way (the specs on the Amazon web site states there is a low battery indicator).  Customer service told me the way to tell when a charge is indcated is one of three ways:  the razor is dead; the razor runs slow; or the recommended way is to manually track how long you have used it and when you get to about 30 minutes, then charge.  You are warned in the manual NOT to charge until the razor it is near total discharge or the battey life will be effected.  There is no quick charge, it takes 16 hours to charge the razor.&lt;br /&gt;So, since it can&#x27;t run on the cord, and its best to run the battery down to the end before recharging, and there is no warning on low battery, you will find yourself with a dead razor and a 16 hour wait for the next shave opportunity. &lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;ll be leaving the house on many occasions with a 24 hour shadow!&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The Reflex razors all appear to have the same shaving heads and mechanics that produce the actual shave.  So the different model choices/prices deal with features.  Go the few extra bucks for the feature(s) that display low battery, allow corded operation, and/or a quick charge (6 min.).</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It is quiet and does a good job.</li>
    <li> It is close to my skin, which satisfies me. But the spining sound is a little bit noisy. I don&#x27;t know if it is only the defict of mine, or all of the products have this problem.</li>
    <li> You have to get used to not as much power with this one, but it does a good job.  I&#x27;m pleased, for the price it was worth it.</li>
    <li> This shaver was bought for my husband as a gift. Since receiving it, he has put it to use on a daily basis. He gives it a weekly clean by removing the head and either uses the enclosed brush to remove the acumulated stubble or by tapping it against his free hand. The shaver is then put on charge overnight by use of the enclosed power cord. He sometimes uses a pre-shave lotion when desiring the closest possible shave. He is very satified with it and has even recommended this model to his brother and mentioned more than once he is glad to not be buying razor blades. Its quick to use and doesn&#x27;t have the mess associated with lathering up to shave. It has been used on our overseas travel as the unit  is designed for any world voltage standard, requiring only the proper plug adapter to be attached.</li>
    <li> I have been try to return one of the shavers since 6-28-06.  Mailing labers were to be mail to me at my address: &lt;br /&gt;806 Cherokee Lane &lt;br /&gt;Twin Falls,  Id 83301 &lt;br /&gt;A second laber was to be mailed after I did not receive the first one. To date I have not receive either.  I am not sure I would order anything again from Amazon.  I am not please with your service. One box has not been opened and I wish to return it for credit to my card account.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the length ot time needed to recharge the razor.  The old Norelco,  five years old, required one and one half hours to recharge, The new one takes sixteen hours.</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor for starters.  This was my first electric razor and I decided to go with a cheaper version rather than the hi-fi expensive ones.  This was well worth the money spent.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for over 2 years now.  I&#x27;ll be upgrading next year, but spending 60 bucks for the razor and replacement blades over a 3 year period is not bad at all.  The shaving is very good, although I would expect just a little sharper (maybe too picky here).</li>
    <li> Not bad for a good priced shaver. But the battery seemed to wear out prematurely. I use it now when all other options are not available but in runs in &amp;#34;slow-motion.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I recently switched over to this electric shaver and I must say I am impressed. The reason why I give this model 4 and not 5 starts is that it takes 16hrs to charge which is a bit inconvinient. But I&#x27;ve learnt to keep my disposable razors handy, just incase.&lt;BR&gt;This shaver gives a really smooth shave and it makes the job so easy that sometimes I shave twice a day. I would certainly recommend it for the price that it is selling for these days.</li>
    <li> I like it, shaves close and comfortable. much better than my old cordless Norelco. I would recommend buying this one instead of new cutting heads for an older razor, a few dollors more but you would have a new razor.</li>
    <li> I never owned an electric shaver before, but I hit a homer with this one. Used it 20 times so far and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it. Easy to clean, and does a nice job. Completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Since Im using this razor, my face is bit irritated after shaving, it takes more than 3 weeks to get used to it. Another thin is, this razor takes too much time for charging and short time of use(aprox. 15 min) .Overall. it works for me only if I use it in early hours (7 or 8 am) after that, its a mess</li>
    <li> I give this three stars only because it is a Norelco, but not more because the battery failed after eight months because I left it plugged in too often in part because of the fact that the charging system does not tell you when its charged.  I&#x27;m going to upgrade to the Norelco cord/cordless, but would not buy this product again because of those inconveniences.  Caveat Emptor.</li>
    <li> Does not irritate face and neck. Close shave.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried Remington shavers and they left big red marks on my neck. Been using an electric shaver for 30 years, and made the mistake of switching to Remington due to a sale. What a mistake. I am back to Norelco, perhaps it there movable heads (patented??) that keep your face from getting hacked up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Learn from my mistake !! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> When my last Norelco electric razor finally wore out after almost 18 years of service, I purchased the \\&quot;top-of-the-line\\&quot; Remington rotary electric razor. What a mistake. After using it for just under a year, I trashed it and decided to purchase the Norelco 6613X Reflex Plus Electric Razor. It proved to be a wise decision. It is compact in size and easy to hold. It provides a shave that&#x27;s as close to a blade shaver as you could possibly get plus the Amazon.com purchase price was $[...] less than the regular, suggested retail price.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot to be said about this shaver. It works just fine, giving a close, clean shave. There are no whistles or bells, just a decent, inexpensive shaver. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Why pay ridiculous prices for Gillette&#x27;s razors when you can buy the Norelco and only have to change blades once a year?  Smooth, comfortable shave every time.  It does take a little longer if you go 3+ days w/out shaving, but for everyday shaving, you can&#x27;t beat it.  The pop out trimmer is great too.</li>
    <li> I got this Shaver 2 years back and it still works fine without any issues. It gives closer shave and also the trimmer is perfect for trimming the sidebeards and trying out new goatees :D It&#x27;s also sturdy. I have dropped it few times in the hard floor. Nothing happened, it just worked fine. I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this product; it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I must have bought this 5+ years ago and put it on the shelf because the blades and carrier were all I needed because the dog chewed up the Norelco I already had. My old dog chewed Norelco&#x27;s battery finally went bad after 10 years so I put the blades and carrier back into this one, charged the battery and it works great.</li>
    <li> Great shave.  I purchased this, and didn&#x27;t regret it.  Quick shipment too. I have no way of checking on the quality, but the price is right.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of Norelco Shavers but I would like a a light or similar warning  to deshow  the ideal time to recharge the battery.</li>
