      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>

      <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>It lasts throughout the work day for sure.  </li>
      <li>I read the results on the Olay page and should have listened to many of the women there.  </li>
      <li>The REGENERIST line of products makes some pretty impressive claims and the results of using them don&#x27;t exactly measure up to the package inserts.  </li>

      <li>I used one full tube and liked it but wasn&#x27;t in a hurry to buy again.  </li>
      <li>At a good price, you can expect to get a good daily eye treatment in a convenient \\&quot;no-touch\\&quot; dispenser.   </li>
      <li>I was pleased with how it worked even if I didn&#x27;t notice any smoothing of the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Olay&#x27;s Regenerist uses a push-in stick roller delivers liquid and is \\&quot;kind of cold because the roller is metal.\\&quot;  Mrs. B saw \\&quot;no difference, really, although I don&#x27;t have big bags under my eyes, but it didn&#x27;t really do anything different.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would she buy it? \\&quot;No, but that&#x27;s not beause it didn&#x27;t work. It could work for somebody else, but not me.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product works just fine, but it contains methylparaben, a highly toxic ingredient, and it isn&#x27;t so good it&#x27;s worth putting poision on my skin.  I will continue to pay more to use Ayurmedic products, which work just as well and have safe, natural ingredients.  For those who are less concerned with cosmetic safety and who want to be able to purchase a product in a the drug store, this is still just an okay choice, as there are now much safer products on the market which are just as effective.</li>
    <li> My wife used this product for 3 days. On the 3rd day her eyes became very swollen with tiny red spots. She immediately discontinued using it,and took an antihistamine, didn&#x27;t help much.    Today I went online to do more research, and found many complaints of similar nature. Even the Olay website has many complaints in a product review section.   I called in and they offered a refund. I don&#x27;t care much about the refund, I wanted to know how to get rid of the swollen eyes with red spots.   If you go to Olay web site and search for this product, you&#x27;ll get \\&quot;This product is no longer available.\\&quot; So if the manufacturer itself is no longer producing this product, why don&#x27;t they recall it all together...... HORRIBLE......</li>
    <li> I can see a slight difference in the puffiness under my eyes, which is better than no difference.  I have used ths for the last two weeks, each morning.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this.  I love most of the other Regenerist items and I had high hopes for this, too.  I have been using this anti-aging roller for over 60 days and I don&#x27;t see any kind of improvement at all.  In fact, I took a before &amp; after picture so I could compare and there was no difference.  I guess there is no scientific way to prove this; after all, maybe if I HAD NOT used this for the past 60 days my after picture might look even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massaging the cream into my eye area with the cold metal roller balls felt like heaven, but I think this method of dispensing is a little on the gimmicky side.  I watched closely as I glided the balls over my under-eye area and it actually looked like there was more pulling and tugging than if I had used my ring finger and lightly tapped the cream into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cream dispensing out of the roller tube, one click was more than enough - it was hard to evenly disperse the cream onto both eye areas - if half the amount came out that would have been the perfect amount for one eye. Instead I had to click once, and dab some under both eyes, then go back with the roller balls and massage the cream in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The under eye area felt a little sticky for several hours, probably due to the amount that comes out with one click; that was way more cream than I apply when using other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin with a little crepiness under the eye, and very faint crows feet with some fine lines - I&#x27;m sorry to say this product didn&#x27;t help with any of my problems.  Maybe it&#x27;s more for puffy-ness and dark circles, which I do not have unless I eat something salty the night before.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this product for the longest time ever since I saw the commerical. I have fairly easy manageable skin. I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on how smooth it looks. The only problems are the dark circles and puffiness underneath my eyes. I decided to try this product. The first time I tried it was at night. The next morning I noticed my eyes were more puffy than before and thought it was normal. I tried it the next night and the next morning it gotten worse. It looked like I&#x27;ve had not sleep and had been crying all night. It was embarrassing. All it takes is two tries and I will NEVER EVER AGAIN use this product. Please save your money and DO NOT buy this product. It DOES NOT WORK!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Oil of Olay products. I started using the moisturizer when I was about 18.  I am now 41 and looking younger than ever.  People think I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s.  Is that Awesome or What?  As for the Olay Regenerist Line, it&#x27;s the best!  I was starting to get dark circles under my eyes from stress.  So, I tried the Anti-Aging Eye Roller.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and now, you can barely see them.  This products is the BEST!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It is easy and convenient to use. I keep mine in the fridge for those days when my eyes feel puffy, what a relief and soothing. I love all Olay products. Thank you, Carmella</li>
    <li> Olay promises instant results for morning puffy eye syndrome. That never happened after 3+ weeks of trying this stuff. However, I like the \\&quot;pen roller\\&quot; because the massage feels nice and doesn&#x27;t hurt the very sensitive skin under the eyes. My eyes have broken out a few times when I tried to treat them, but not with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advantage of the product is having a safe way to treat the eyes. But it doesn&#x27;t improve appearance any faster than not treating them. The puffiness from allergies goes down about the same time as it does with or without the Olay product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again if they could lower the price just to be able to keep moisturizing around the eyes and getting a little massage. The price is steep for something that doesn&#x27;t show any anti-aging results.</li>
    <li> Love the applicator for this product.  It is applied using a pen like applicator.  Press the clicker end of the pen and gently rub the nub part of the pen (with the little rollers on it) to the area of your eye you would like to treat.  No hands!  Feels cool and gentle on the skin!  Designed for anti aging so it is preventive not curative. If you already have wrinkles may want to use another product as well.  Hard to evaluate if it works or not.  Will only know over time. Rate four for the applicator.  Honestly hard to tell if it does work.  For those who are very savvy about these kind of products may be the ingredients will be a better indicator of how effective it may be.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after the death of a beloved step-parent, hoping to banish puffiness beneath the eyes from crying.  Alas, no luck on that score, but it was nice otherwise.  It goes on smoothly and has a good feeling on the skin.  I can&#x27;t say that I notice myself looking much younger, but I never really expected that.  But it does feel like I am pampering myself when I use it ...</li>
    <li> Like other Olay products I have used, Regenerist does exactly what it says it will do.   At a good price, you can expect to get a good daily eye treatment in a convenient \\&quot;no-touch\\&quot; dispenser.   My husband and I both used this product for several weeks, and there is a noticeable reduction in under eye lines and puffiness.   I saw the best results when I used this product twice daily, before bed and in the morning right out of the shower.   Results were significantly less when I sporadically used the product.    Regenerist is comparative to others of the same type.   I could not find anything substantial that makes this product stand out above the many other products out there on the market that profess the same results.  However there are some minor things to consider, this product is non-greasy, non-sticky and works very well under make-up. The formula is thin enough to use over make-up and in other areas of the face like around the lip area.   The roller dispenser has advantages and disadvantages.  It took me several minutes to figure it out, but once you get used to it, I can see why it&#x27;s better than using your finger to apply.     Overall, I think I will continue to use this product for the reasons I list above.  I like the convenience of the pen shape which takes up little space in my make-up drawer.</li>
    <li> Perhaps the reason I&#x27;m not too thrilled with the results of this product is because I&#x27;m used to applying creams to my crows feet area daily &amp; nightly.  After using this for a few weeks, I don&#x27;t notice any difference or improvement, and actually miss using my old Olay Regenerist, which I actually like the silkiness feel it has when I put it on.  With this item, you simply click to get the lotion out and gently roll it on.  While the metal balls feel kind of strange, they&#x27;re oddly soothing at the same time, but I&#x27;m left feeling kind of stiff and sticky around the crows feet, something I&#x27;d never experienced with my Regenerist.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a double pack from Costco.  Immediately after I used it I noticed a little increase in puffiness, but thought it was just my imagination.  By the next night I looked like someone had beaten me up (minus the black and blue coloration)!  It took almost a week of NOT using the product and applying mega amounts of pure aloe vera gel to my undereye area to get back to normal!!!  I thought I was going to be scarred for life---not kidding!&lt;br /&gt;Thank God I got my old dry and slightly wrinkled undereye area back!  I was just looking for a bit of moisture and help for the undereye area!  NEVER again from Olay!  Shame on them but I feel shame on me too.... \\&quot;All is vanity..\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I should&#x27;ve known better than to fall for the hype.... BTW when I called Olay to report the problem, the less than sympathetic customer service lady seemed like she couldn&#x27;t care less and I think that goes for the company.  I received a \\&quot;form letter\\&quot; response saying how sorry they were and how what I experienced was rare.  After reading reviews about this product here and elsewhere, I really don&#x27;t think this is such a \\&quot;rare\\&quot; occurence at all. In fairness to them they did refund my money and sent Pantene coupons as well (don&#x27;t ask me why???). Also, I was careful and didn&#x27;t roll over the area hard and never got any in my eyes.  But what resulted was an increase in puffiness (almost instantly) and then on top of that it looked and felt like a chemical burn.  I had to rinse the area several times a day with cold water since any sweat made it sting like crazy.  I just thank God I recovered!</li>
    <li> I gave this product over a month of use before writing this review as well as giving it the benefit of the doubt.  Unfortunately, I saw no noticable results.  The product packaging claimed I would be able to notice reduced eye puffiness as well as fine line reduction, but none of this was even remotely visible on my skin.  The only reason I am giving this two stars instead of one is because it does feel somewhat soothing to use because of the roller balls so even though I did not see any results it did feel relaxing to apply.    I caution anyone who is interested in the product to try a sample before purchasing.  My experience is that the (lack of) results just do not justify the costs.</li>
    <li> This is one area that my mom, wife, and any woman in the family always using a bunch of very expensive creams and gadgets to get out the wrinkles.  Gave this to my sister who is 30 years old, it&#x27;s a bit early for her to be using this as she doesn&#x27;t have much wrinkles around that area yet.  Though after about 6 month of use, she says although the bit of wrinkles that was there didn&#x27;t go away, nothing new came up, which is a big plus.  If you aren&#x27;t aging, then you are staying young and that&#x27;s would be a positive for this item.</li>
    <li> I used this product several times in order to evaluate it since I had eye irritation right after I used it the first time.  I thought the reaction might have been caused by something else.  I determined that the cause was indeed the product.  Although it did reduce the puffiness around the eyes it caused eye irritation and even blurred vision until I washed it off and used eye drops to clear my eyes.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this a lot and will buy it.  A nice creamy-feeling emolient for under the eyes at night.  Easy to put on.  No chance of overdoing it as far as pulling that delicate skin.  Just pump once to get some product to the surface and roll under your eyes.  Not greasy at all.  Felt really nice.  I think it did my eyes some good.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for about 3 weeks, and I see NO difference. I think, the lines got darker and I noticed that I started to get red spots. So I stopped using it for now. Not worth it, try something else.</li>
    <li> I use many of the Olay Regenerist products, and they are among my favorite... but this particular one is a bit underwhelming.  I have tried the Garnier eye roller product, and had just as good results, as far as treating morning bags under the eye.  I actually prefer the Regenerist Eye DermaPods over either brand of the eye rollers.  Yes, the roller is a quick and simple method to apply the product, which may be worth while to ladies who have to get down and dirty with their beauty routine.  Myself, I will stick with those cute little pods that work so well for me...</li>
    <li> I really love the applicator - there is something very soothing about rubbing the little roller balls back and forth under my eyes. It seems to give you a very controlled amount of the cream this way - I wish all products had this type of applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel like there was an improvement in my eyes, but nothing so drastic that people would actually say something to me. I will continue to use this product, and hope to prevent eye lines so that I don&#x27;t need to deal with them later.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple products to help with various eye aging &#x27;problems&#x27;. This product made me break out in small itchy dry red bumps under both my eyes. I am allergic to latex and did not see it listed on the ingredients but I have had a similar breakout with a face product that used a latex derivative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use caution if you have contact allergy problems.</li>
    <li> Both my best friend and I bought this product. We decided that now that we have officially hit our \\&quot;mid thirties\\&quot; it was time to get more serious with eye mosturizer. After one week of using the product we BOTH woke up this morning with puffy, red eyes. You can even see that the red and puffiness is only where they eye roller has touched, so it has to be this product. I suggest testing it first on another area, or if you have sensitive skin and/or other allergies, I would avoid this product all together. Other Olay product work well for me, but I feel this is an inferior product.</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay&#x27;s daily uv moisturizer, so the company reputation was enough to convince me to try this product. I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles or a cheap face lift, so when I did see a subtle but noticeable difference, that was good enough for me. The effect isn&#x27;t long lasting, and is certainly more effective on fine lines -- I know because I also tried it on those deeper furrows between my brows -- and I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s marketed for those fine lines around the eyes. Although there is a subtle improvement of those fine lines, the difference just isn&#x27;t enough to be worth the price, in my opinion. Instead, I&#x27;ll work at wrinkle prevention by sticking with my Olay moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I keep on trying this and it does absolutely nothing.  Really. Not a thing.  I started doing one eye only to prove it.  Very disappointed as I&#x27;ve rarely found an Olay product that did not live up to at least most of its claims.  No reduction in puffy eyes, or bags, no improved skin around the eyes -- just a waste of money for me. If I could return this, I would.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay moisturizer for years, I trusted that the Olay Regenerist Anti Aging Eye Roller would be worth trying on my puffy under-eye area.  MISTAKE!  After only one application, my under eye areas are swollen and angry red three days later.  I have a metal allergy, but have used other brands of eye rollers without this reaction.  Not everyone will have a reaction, but how would you know until it is too late?</li>
    <li> Really tried to see a benefit...sometimes I looked and well, maybe, then I looked again....no, not really.  In the first week I found myself with a soreness in the area and then a small pimple.  Thought that maybe it was working to clean out some bad &#x27;stuff????.&#x27;   Rolling the serum, which turns out to be pretty pricey in the overall, just stimulates the area to a pink and a puffing of minimal nature, hence, the sometime look of disappearing lines. It is also not a pleasant feeling.  Even gently, they are metal rollers.  I would rather use a good eye cream and gently tap around the eye area as I applied it.  It is also helpful to do this when applying any makeup or concealer.   One thing I did get as a benefit: that I was doing more on my own than this product could provide.</li>
    <li> Having used as directed for some time now, I have yet to see any change in the appearence of fine lines around the eyes.  It does not hurt anything but does not seem to make much of a difference either.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for under eye bags, puffiness, or lines. Just a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try new Olay Regenerist...and I am always worried about fine lines around the corners of my eyes, and under my eyes, so I was thrilled to see if this was going to be just the thing for me.  Love the roller applicator~~it&#x27;s simple, no way to contaminate while applying, and you click it for the right amount of moisturizer.  1 click you get a little, 2 clicks a little bit more and so on.  I was thrilled with how easy it was to put on, and you can actually feel it moisturizing as soon as it hits your skin.  I used it for 16 days....and was actually quite pleased with the way my eyes looked.  The lines were not as noticeable, my eyes weren&#x27;t as dark underneath, and the skin felt smooth and supple.  I was thrilled with it!! BUT...I have combination and very sensitive skin.  After about 3 days I noticed that my face was breaking out on my cheeks and nose.  I get very few break outs, and when I do it&#x27;s usually one blemish at a time. Suddenly I had several, and as I continued to use the Olay Anti Aging Eye Roller, my face broke out more and more.  So I thought I&#x27;d stop using it for a few days and see if it was the culprit.  Sure enough, within a few days to a week my face cleared up.  Not sure WHY I broke out on other parts of my face, when I only applied it around my eyes, but I certainly did.&lt;br /&gt;Which is too bad, because this is a great product.  If you&#x27;re skin it not sensitive, or you have really dry skin that&#x27;s not prone to break outs, I&#x27;d say snatch this stuff up, as you&#x27;ll be thrilled with the appearance of your eyes within a week.  If you ARE prone to break outs, or have very sensitive skin, this is probably NOT your best bet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months now and haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference around my eye area.  I actually have been using this more as a moisturizer for my whole face in addition to just around the eyes. it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t glob out and it never gives you too much. A little really goes a long way. At first i thought that this bottle would be waaay too little to last for any length of time, but it has.  To use it just as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but I still like it.</li>
    <li> I have no known allergies and have never had a reaction to any skin product.    Sunday: I used the product as directed.  Monday: My eyes felt a little irritated and tired.  I used it again that night.  Tuesday: My eyes were very irritated and swollen.  I realized what was happening, so I stopped using it and soothed my eyes with drops and cool compresses.  Wednesday: My eyes were so swollen I had to call in sick.  Thursday: My eyes were nearly swollen shut.  I went to the doctor, who prescribed a 6-day steroid pack.  One week later my eyes are back to normal.    My reaction was similar to my friend&#x27;s reaction to Sephora lip gloss.  There must be something in these products that puff up your skin to reduce wrinkles.  That just doesn&#x27;t seem natural to me.  There is no way this is healthy for your skin in the long run.    I&#x27;ve used Olay SPF 15 lotion for 15 years, and have always trusted the name.  There is no indication that this product can have such an effect, and that it should be tested on a hidden area of tender skin first.  Shame on Olay.</li>
    <li> it made my eyes water.</li>
    <li> After using this for 2 days, around my eyes became itchy, red, and puffy.  The skin is very dry with raised little red bumps.  Not very attractive having reptile skin under my eyes. Thanks Olay -- now my already puffy eyes are inflamed!How long is it going to take to heal from this? I took benadryl last night but my eyes are still puffy. Horrible! Someone brought up a good point that the reactions might be caused by the metal balls used for the roller. I do have reactions to cheap metals, so that is a possibility. However, it&#x27;s not worth the risk. I highly advise people to stay away from this product. I received it for free when I purchased Olay Regenerist Night Serum. It said it was a $20 value, but now I see why they are giving it away for free! Not only is this product a disaster, its dangerous!</li>
    <li> I love this eye roller. It&#x27;s soothing, moisturizing and  aids in minimizing fine lines. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my fiance to try.  She had the following to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected more instructions on how to use the product because it&#x27;s hard to tell how much cream you&#x27;re supposed to push out onto the roller balls. It only says \\&quot;rub under eye area for 30 seconds\\&quot; without further instructions. Using the roller ball under sensitive spots on the eye area was markedly uncomfortable. Recognizing that using the roller ball under the eye area for 30 seconds twice a day for 30 days would improve blood flow to the area, it&#x27;s hard to say if the cream or the increase in blood flow actually helps with wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first night, I definitely noticed less puffiness in the under eye area and less dryness. However, after 3 weeks, there is no significant difference in the tiny outer eye wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good product in theory, but poorly executed. The roller balls alone without the cream may be just as beneficial - it&#x27;s hard to say.</li>
    <li> I have always been a skeptic about these sorts of products--and when the Vine program asked me to review it, I thought, \\&quot;what the heck, I know it won&#x27;t work, but why not?\\&quot;.  I ride a motorcycle and get puffy eyes from the wind...I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, either haha...so I do get my share of tired looking eyes.  Being a personal trainer, that&#x27;s not such a great way to promote fitness, health, nutrition and good sleep patterns.  Anyway...I tried this product and it made SUCH a difference!  My eyes looked younger, not tired--so much better.  The effects don&#x27;t last long but when it does work, it \\&quot;works\\&quot;.  It lasts throughout the work day for sure.  So, I gave this 3 stars because of it not lasting longer, but this skeptic actually likes this product.</li>
    <li> This is not a miracle product -- it conceals some flaws. It doesn&#x27;t reverse aging (nothing can)! But it&#x27;s better to use this than not use anything! The price is appropriate (the roller lasts a long time). 3 stars!</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for a week. Purchased because I tried a sample of Dermalogica Total Eye care which was great for puffiness, and I saw this advertised on Keith Olbermann&#x27;s show. I really like the applicator because you don&#x27;t have to touch your eye area and it seems to moisturize pretty well, but as for puffiness, it hasn&#x27;t been as effective as the more expensive Dermalogica. Sometimes I wake up with baggy eyes and sometimes not. I&#x27;m willing to give it a few more weeks, however.</li>
    <li> This is a nice eye cream.  I&#x27;m not sure how big a difference I see before I put it on and after...I&#x27;m not that observant...but it&#x27;s a nice moisturizing cream.  And the rollers make it fun.  It would be great for travel, too.</li>
    <li> This eye roller is a must try. The skin around my eyes was getting a little crepey, and after 2 weeks I saw a noticeable difference. The skin was smoother and felt silky to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 weeks of using the product, my eyes looked more open and fresh. I have used 8 different eye creams and the list includes some creams that cost upward of $50. This eye roller is also great because the rolling action gently massages the skin around the eye and that feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Try it girls! You will be glad u did!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago, and started using it straight away - I actually did see the product work - it was fantastic I loved it...after a couple of days though I noticed that the skin just under my eyes was puffier than normal and that I had developed a little rash under each eye. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the cause, but stopped using everything. After a day it went away again. Because I didn&#x27;t know what was causing the rash it was several days before i reapplied it...again - fabulous results, and again the following day I have sore eyes with a little rash again.    Well its going in the bin. I&#x27;m very disappointed to have reacted this way to it, as when i first apply it I see results. It works. if you can get past the allergic reactions to it then it is a fabulous product.</li>
    <li> This item appeared to be used and the box was not new it was all crunched up and I compared it to a new one I bought and it was very light so there was not very much in it and it was suposed to be new.</li>
    <li> This was reccomended to me, don&#x27;t recall by whom though.  I read the results on the Olay page and should have listened to many of the women there.  I applied it and a few hours later I was so broke out! I assure you it is not because of sensitive skin either.  Washed my face to get that off, but I guess it was already asborbed into my skin.  My face was so broke out and raw in spaces.  This tooks WEEKS to clear.  My face was scabby, not thick blood looking scabs, they were thin and a light pink color, but it turned my face pink forever.  That was the worst thing I have EVER spent money on!  I would reccommend you read a lot of these opinions, both good and bad to make sure you don&#x27;t waste your $20.  By the way, I gave it a \\&quot;one\\&quot; star, because zero isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I recommend</li>
    <li> The first night I used it, it seemed to be alright. So, the second night I used it and I woke up with the under area of my eyes irritated and red. I happened to have a doctor&#x27;s appointment that day so I pointed it out to him. It was just one eye that was really puffed up, although the other was slightly raw. He said it looked like just a mosquito bite so he put some alcohol on it and left it at that. I stopped using it for a couple weeks to make sure that it was just that. I forgot I had it but found it last night and tried it. When I woke up this morning, my left eye was almost swollen shut, and they both itched persistently. I took a couple Benadryl and the swelling has gone down, but both my eyes are still irritated. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying this product again. I feel like I wasted $20. I will be contacting Olay about this.</li>
    <li> really didnt work that well for me</li>
    <li> This was something my daughter-in-law wanted for Christmas.  I had never heard of it before, but I researched it and I understood why my daughter-in-law wanted it.  She said she was very happy that I was able to get it for her.</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is disgusting, and it make my eyes burn and my skin rash. I only tried it because the OIL OF OLAY brand is reputed to be gentle and all natural. Due to the unpleasant experience, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My Wife tried this out.  She doesn&#x27;t really have any eye wrinkles, but she uses Olay products to stay that way.  The applicator was easy and fun to use.  After application, the area around her eyes swelled up a little.  The result is that the fine lines do disappear temporarily, but that is due to minor swelling, not an actual treatment of any kind.  After the puffiness disappears, the lines return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for long term effects, well I cannot speak to that now, unless I wait a year or so to write this review.  As it is, this product is a major disappointment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Regenerist line of products, more because they are very gentle to the skin than because of the results, which are pretty subtle. Before trying this item, I was using the other Olay Regenerist eye serum.  [[ASIN:B000EBZ7XK Olay Regenerist Eye Serum (.5 Ounces)]] I like this one a lot, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in results between the two products. As for the massage idea, I always thought the best thing to do with undereye skin is leave it alone except for moisturizing. The packaging and rollers strike me as pricey gimmicks. But the product itself is fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always experimenting with eye creams but never thought that what I needed was a totally different way of delivering them onto my skin!  This eye cream looks like a pen,  and you pump it once and then glide it around your eyes,  with the 3 small balls rolling the cream on for you - you never touch the delicate eye area with your own finger.  And it feels terrific.  It really makes puffy eyes look and feel calmer and I like that I couldn&#x27;t put too much on.  It&#x27;s not heavy and never stings my very sensitive eyes.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This was sent as a vine request for review.  I used it as instructed for about six weeks.  I liked the way the three ball bearings massage the little fat pocket under my eyes.  The theory is that they break up the fat and it is supposed to dissipate it over time.  I just didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  Perhaps you have to do it longer.  I think an eye job is the only thing that will permanently make a difference.</li>
    <li> roller massages your eyes and it also reduces puffiness. good product at a reasonable price. I purchased 10 of them as it is getting difficult to find. Not sure if they are trying to phase it out. I hope not.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a double pack from Costco, mostly for preventative measures because I&#x27;m almost in my thirties and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to start early.  Apparently a poorly made decision as the following reactions happened immediately:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Puffiness.  I actually thought this was supposed to happen and even though it didn&#x27;t really look good, it did look a little less wrinkley, due to the puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Mild red rash.  Looked a little like a chemical burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Obnoxious burning sensation.  I tried washing it off with soap but it doesn&#x27;t seem to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it once at night, again in the morning and one more time to following night, thinking maybe my skin just needed to adjust.  But I looked this up and now realize that apparently this is common.</li>
    <li> The massage action of the rollers gives a soothing sensation and plumps up the eye area immediately after use but the cream is not really effective. Very watery. And the area only stays plump for a few hours.I&#x27;m in my 20s and it does next to nothing for my fine lines, but it&#x27;s an alright moisturizer. This roller should be used in combination with another eye cream for maximum effectiveness cause the rolling action helps incorporate the product alot better than just using your fingers. There are better formulas out there.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product. I used it regularly until all of the lotion was gone and I&#x27;m sorry to say I have noticed no results. Olay let me down with this one.</li>
    <li> When I ordered the anti-aging eye roller I thought, yeah sure, this will be like any other product that advertises the reduction of eye bags and puffiness. But, and I mean a big BUT, I found that it really does reduce the appearance of bags and puffiness.  I am glad I tried it and I am glad it is an OLAY product because I use OLAY exclusively for face and body.  Anyway, I would and have recommended this product to others so they can try it and other OLAY products.  I don&#x27;t mind asking, because I am on a fixed income, for coupons, very substantial coupons for OLAY products.  I also like the regenerist moisturizer which I use at least twice a day.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Used this twice. I was eager to try this after watching the commercial on tv. Saw it at the store &amp; thought it was pricy but gave it a chance anyways. My first time using it I noticed the next day my eyes were a bit red underneath &amp; had what looked like rash-like bumps. I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure if it was this product so a week or so later I gave it another chance only to be disappointed again. This time my reaction was worse &amp; my eyes were puffy, more red with even more rash-like bumps on them. I&#x27;ll never use this again or recommend it to anyone. I wish there was some way of getting my money back.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this when I read that there were a lot of women that had severe irritation from using this product. I figured it was just some peoples sensitivity and mostly likely a low percentage that this happened to. I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for years and felt comfortable buying it. WELL~~ This product is HIGHLY irritating to the eyes. It&#x27;s made my eyes swell like crazy. My brows and eyelids swell like I have two black eyes for over 24 hours with one application. My eyes feel gritty and pus gathers in the corners. I&#x27;ve applied it 5 times 1 week apart and have had the exact same result. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It&#x27;s toxic to the skin or something. HORRIBLE!![[ASIN:B0028K3J9O Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Eye Anti-Aging Roller, 0.2 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> will anything really take off years?  this product is very moisturizing and make my under eyes look less puffy.  I don&#x27;t mess with rolling for any time, just put in on and go.</li>
    <li> I went through a difficult time in my life and did alot of crying. I noticed more wrinkles under my eyes than usual, I was so excited to see that Olay had this new eye-roller that claimed to reduce eye puffiness and would diminish some of the fine lines etc I thought that if I used this product right away I would get a grip on the fine lines and swelling. Initially the roller ball felt great, I was really hoping for some instant results as I work full time and dreaded going out in public with such swollen eyes. I put it on before I went to bed and the next morning I woke up and my eyes were so swollen I barely recognized myself, the product made my under eye area twice as swollen and to make matters worse I noticed small red bumps and a painful stinging, my skin was burning!  There are now big red welts under my eyes and I&#x27;m just sure there will be some scaring from the burning. It hurts and I&#x27;ve applied a cool washcloth to provide some temporary relief. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews however I felt the need to tell anyone who is considering buying this product my experience. I wish I had read all the reviews before purchasing. I purchased this product in a local retail store. I am going to see if I can return it and get a refund. I am also going to write Olay as I have now lost faith in their entire product line. It&#x27;s supposed to be an Anti-Aging Product, by the look under my eyes I have aged 20+ years I am not kidding. Using this product was much like pouring salt into a wound! My experience with this product was very, very painful.</li>
    <li> Allow me to get the positives out of the way.  This product comes in an attractive, professional package.  The product dispenser is surprisingly large (5 1/4\\&quot; long, 3/4\\&quot; in diameter) making it easy to hold and control, and the rollers are nice, cool, and smooth when rubbed against the skin.  I rather liked it as application of the cream was quick, clean, and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where the positives end for me, however.  The cream itself is very \\&quot;watery\\&quot; in substance and is very slow to absorb into the skin.  It&#x27;s easy to use too much and I find myself not even using a full button press&#x27; worth of cream for both eyes.  Half a press is still more than enough. The biggest problem, however, is the state it leaves my eyes in after application.  My eyes have been burning and teary all day long, and this has happened every time I use this product.  I&#x27;ve tried applying it further away from the rim of my eyelid, thinking maybe it was getting rubbed into my eyes somehow, but that made no difference.  Thankfully no redness and no swelling has occured, but it definitely leaves me in a lot of discomfort.  On top of this, I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes in the fine lines and dark shadows under my eyes.  I feel I wasted two Hamiltons on a product that (1)doesn&#x27;t do anything for me and (2)causes me constant, chronic discomfort and sometimes even pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works for some people, but I would definitely say \\&quot;buyer beware\\&quot; with this particular Olay product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many brands of eye creams and this one really works well, especially for the price. It measures up to the high-end lines that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. The rollerball makes the application of the eyecream very smooth and comfortable and it works fast. By the time I am applying my foundation/make-up, puffines is reduced and lines and drakness are fading.</li>
    <li> I love the roller balls with this eye cream. My eyes are extremely sensitive, and the thing I like best about this product is that your fingers never touch the sensitive area around the eyes in applying the cream. No worry about the natural salt on your finger tips touching the skin or poking or scratching oneself with a fingernail. The roller balls feel cool as they touch the skin, and the cream is soothing. I even use this in smoothing fine lines around my mouth or in the &amp;#34;frown crease&amp;#34; on my forehead between my eyes. I store mine upright and pump just once or twice, taking care to watch the volume of cream that comes out so as to use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Could not use this as showed allergy to it.  MADE MY EYES EVEN MORE [PUFFIER.  ITS A GOOD IDEA BUT  NOT FOR ME.</li>
    <li> annoyingly difficult to open and if not stored upright does not easily dispense when used.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing because I hate sticking my finger in the little pots eye serums usually come in.  Goes on easily and seems to work well.  I remember to use it every day since it is so easy.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice and had a terrible allergic reaction. The skin around my eyes swelled up so much my eyes would only open halfway. Then red bumps started forming and the area became itchy. I took benadryl during the first day and nothing happened. By the end of day two the swelling started to go down, but it took a full five days for the swelling to stop. The skin is still dry and feels like alligator skin. Don&#x27;t use this product! I wish Olay would figure out what ingredient is giving everyone this reaction -- I&#x27;ve used another eye creme from them in the past and it was fine.</li>
    <li> OLAY is a company that keeps rather strict controls on its products and in general the products rank high on the Consumer Index list and among those involved in cosmetic surgery and cosmetologists.  The REGENERIST line of products makes some pretty impressive claims and the results of using them don&#x27;t exactly measure up to the package inserts.  But think about the alternative. The skin both above and below the eye relaxes more quickly with the elements of volume loss in aging than about any other place on the face.  Anything that is safe and &#x27;exercises&#x27; the skin and underlying collagen while applying much needed moisturizer is at least a step toward combating the look of tired eyes.  This product, a tube with three rollerheads on the applicator end that roll on moisturizer, is easy to use and if used correctly (applying the massaging motion from the outer portion of the lower eye in a circular fashion toward the nose and then onto the upper lid to the starting point) does provide some rather swift improvement to the sagginess of the tissue.  In tandem with a fine facial moisturizer and coupling these with plenty of sleep and water intake will retard the appearance of aging.  No, no miracles here.  Olay Regenerist doesn&#x27;t claim to know Ponce de Leon!  Grady Harp, December 11</li>
    <li> Good price for a great product.  I have been using this eye roller for years -- and love it -- even when it is more expensive.  This was a bargain.</li>
    <li> The product worked ok in the 1st week, but my skin started to have breakouts 2nd week and every time when I try to use it.  Watch out, it may not work for you!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and it is amazing! He just rolls it on in the morning and night. He says it is super easy to apply and works great for puffy eyes in the morning. Really moisturizing and hydrating. Works great for anti-aging for under the eyes too!</li>
    <li> Not terribly impressed. Certainly not instant. Over a period of a month, there might be a slight difference. Wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I have an 8 week old so I&#x27;m not sure if my dark circles are due to lack of sleep (duh) but I do like the feeling when I apply it because it feels cold.  I believe I read somewhere you could put this in the fridge which would really help to &amp;#34;de-puff&amp;#34; dark circles.  If you press really hard on the bottom, I feel a lot of product comes out, therefore I press it softly to conserve the amount that comes out.  I would probably buy this product again.  I always keep what a doctor once told me in the back of my mind, she said that none of the eye creams/lotions/serums work to reduce wrinkles, etc....only botox does!</li>
    <li> I do not have any puffiness or dark areas around or under my eyes since I started using it a year ago</li>
    <li> Was quite surprised at how bad this product was. Even by Olay standards. This serum was so watery and thin, it felt like I was using walmart equate brand/ generic Olay. Did nothing to help moisturize my under eyes or reduce swelling. Even after applying I still had to put extra moisturizer under my eyes. Better off just sticking to Olay&#x27;s other serums; regenerist and total effects cause those serums are much better quality.</li>
    <li> I have used this roll on light eye cream for years, at an extremely higher price. When I get up in the AM, I moisten a cotton ball, and wipe around my eyes. I keep the tube in a cool place.  You only have to pump it a few times, and out comes this soft cream which has nice round metal balls on the end. It totally reduces the puffiness you get in the Morning. I eat my breakfast, and when I go back to clean up, the puffiness is gone, and I start my daily RocC  ritual. It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Fonnie</li>
    <li> This was not good for me and the roller was too harsh for the delicate skin under my eyes -- too much pulling and stretching.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible reaction to this product.  I have used plenty of anti-aging creams and moisturizers and never experienced anything like this before.  I put it on at night before bed, and in the morning I had terrible swelling and redness all under my eyes and on my eyelids.  I had to use ice to bring down the swelling.  Not sure if I have a particular allergy to a specific ingredient, but there has to be something in this that isn&#x27;t typically in anti-aging creams and lotions.</li>
    <li> The first couple of times I used this, I got a red, bumpy rash under my eyes.  I discontinued all products, slapped on some hydrocortisone topical against my better judgement, and the redness subsided after about 24 hrs.  I didn&#x27;t think this product was the cause, given the awards and accolades it received, so I gave it another go-- without using ANY other creams on my face at all.  Boom, spots again. And this time, they are pretty raw feeling, so I&#x27;m going to spend my Friday night with a couple of benadryl, because this looks disgusting.  I&#x27;m not a particularly sensitive person--I don&#x27;t have any other allergies, that I&#x27;m aware.  And yet, this stuff is making the skin under my eye FREAK out.    I&#x27;d say, unless you&#x27;re desperate, it&#x27;s probably not worth it.  Stick with Clinique.  Their undereye products feel substantial and soothing, no red bumps included.  Sigh.  I wish I could give this negative five stars for ruining my friday night.</li>
    <li> Like the way this product went on and the result.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years. Easy to apply and it works. Makes my eyes look brighter with no wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for over a month. The cream is light enough for my oily skin and doesn&#x27;t clog. The roller makes for no fuss application. As a moisturizer it helps to keep my skin hydrated and is gentle enough for sensitive skin. Unfortunately, I have not noticed any improvement on overall puffiness which was my main reason for trying this product.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve not noticed a huge difference in eye puffiness when I use this product. My eye puffiness decreases the longer I&#x27;m out of bed, anyway, so I attributed the easing of the puffiness to being out of bed and upright! The days I use this I notice no difference in how long it takes the puffiness to go away. However, it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer. Clicking the button produces too much product for me, as I actually have oily skin and don&#x27;t need a huge amount, just a little very close to the eyes. Perhaps those with drier skin will see more effect. I personally can&#x27;t see paying 22 bucks for this product.</li>
    <li> This product helped around my eyes alot! The only thing was I had to get used the hard feel of the steel when I rolled it under my eyes. It tightened the skin nicely and helped with the dark circles, mine were getting pretty bad!</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try the Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Eye roller, but never picked it up because of the price.  Well, I&#x27;m glad to say I gave it a shot.  You click the product out of the tube.  It says two or three times, but I found one click per eye was enough.  You are supposed to massage the product around your eyes.  I really liked massaging it below the eyes.  It was very cool and relaxing to me.  I have really puffy undereyes and I did notice a difference after applying this product.  It was great.  As far as the fine lines around the eyes I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  Not sure.  Needless to say I would definately buy this product again.  I was pleased with how it worked even if I didn&#x27;t notice any smoothing of the fine lines around my eyes.  Everyone should try this product, it&#x27;s no gimmick.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks there is no change in below the eye puffiness. To see if there is a difference I only do one eye to have a fair comparison. Did nothing.</li>
    <li> it is not working as well as I thought it would</li>
    <li> ive been using olay moisturizers for years. so i gave this eye roller a try. last night was my 2nd night of using it, my under eye area became swollen. I saw a couple of tiny bumps where i applied it. i was so scared i washed my face off right away. this morning when i woke up,  my eyes were still swollen and there were lines in my under eye area and skin felt itchy around my eyes, i sent pictures to my sister and told me to see a dermatologist. i was so disappointed. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0028K3J9O Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Eye Anti-Aging Roller 0.2 Fl Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;I have previously used an eye roller manufactured by Boots. Bought this Olay Regeneris advanced age-defying rollerand after 2 days developed itchy eyes. This became a rash under my eyes which is still sore and red looking. I have had to stop using this product which is unfortunate as I always believed Olay to produce gentle products. Could not possibly recommend.</li>
    <li> I luv this product it is the only eye stuff I buy I will be buying more real soon.thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this product cause I use other Olay items on my face and bath products and they work great. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m allergic to the roller. My husband can use it though. He likes it. It gets rid of his morning bags under his eyes within 5 minutes of using it. Must be nice. Wish that was me getting the benefits of the under eye roller. LOL It&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m just happy I can use their other products.</li>
    <li> I know this may only make sense, it was something that really did not cross my mind until it was too late.  When I wear earring I tend to have allergic reactions if the posts are made with cheap metal.  This product uses metal for the balls, but when I began using it, it didn&#x27;t occur to me the metal used could be of that same CHEAP quality.  After a few days of use the skin under my eyes had a horrible allergic reaction.  I stopped using it immediately but it took about a week for my eyes to recover.  Had Olay done proper research and discovered this could happen, they should have had it posted on their product as a warning.  I did get a refund, but I would have much rather read the warning prior and avoided the whole ordeal altogether.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and way cheaper then local retail store. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone that has used this before.</li>
    <li> I bought and tried this product a few days ago and I&#x27; came out in the most awful painful red blotchy rash with swelling. It still hasn&#x27;t gone down and I&#x27;ve had to get medical treatment. I never usually react to products and I&#x27;ve tried many under eye treatments, but this product was lethal to my skin. Reading some other reviews, others have experienced the same and others have been fine with it.&lt;br /&gt;Use with caution. Personally I think the product should be recalled for further testing due to the high reaction rate.&lt;br /&gt;Hannah</li>
    <li> i feel this is a great product. i would order again, price is right deliver was fast and easy thanks</li>
    <li> Nothing that I would purchase again, and it didn&#x27;t make my wrinkles any less than when I started it.  Use your own judgment</li>
    <li> Poor product.  The product received from the  Amazon distributor was not sealed and appeared to  have been  opened .  Will never buy from this site again!</li>
    <li> After seeing all the negative reviews, I felt I needed to weigh in. I should note that I am 35 years old and that I have a 2 year old.   I have had dark circles for years, and their depth and breadth has only increased since the birth of my son. I have a HUGE collection of concealers, brighteners, highlighters, etc. I am a huge Olay Regenerist fan, so I decided to just give this a try. At first, it just sat in my bathroom because I was using my regular eye cream. Then, one day, panic: I had run out of eye cream and had no backup! Then I spied the trusty Olay roller. I rolled it on when I went to sleep and that was that. Well, I woke up in the middle of the night to feed my son and my eyes were a little puffy, so I rolled them. In the morning, no puffiness. I was psyched. So, I rolled them again before my makeup and went about my day. To make a long story short, I never bought another eye cream because after about 5 days I noticed that not only did I have no puffiness, my dark circles were TOTALLY going away. This is so cliche but my husband actually said, \\&quot;Did you get new makeup or something? You look really good.\\&quot; And I had NO concealer or foundation on. BOOYAH. So that&#x27;s my story. I love the pen and it works wonders for me. I use it at least twice a day, and sometimes i&#x27;ll roll it on midday as a pick-me-up. So moms, maybe this cream is for you.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It really works for me. Within moments puffiness is gone and the small line are not as noticeable. What is noticeable is when I run out! After a week or so the lines come back, so this is something you have to use everyday. On my 53rd birthday my kids asked what I wanted and I said all I want is the Eye  Roller! :)</li>
    <li> Great product and better price</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. And price is good</li>
    <li> Great Eyerooler Just What I Wanted</li>
    <li> Only place we could fine this item that my wife has been using for years and loves the product.  Fast service and great price and it really works though I tell her she really does not need this to look good as she has natural beauty.</li>
    <li> i bought this product hoping i would see a result but i didn&#x27;t. i waited patiently for about a month &amp; a half until it was empty. no results, it felt cool and soothing while applying it but it didn&#x27;t help with my puffiness whatsoever. i am not a fan of oil of olay products to be honest, i was just trying to be optimistic. i&#x27;ll stick to neostrata for my skin care regimen from now on.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I&#x27;ve used a more expensive product with better results, but this lives up to the review that I read on line and did not cost nearly as much.</li>
    <li> I love this eye roller.  Within 20 minutes the puffiness is gone from under my eyes.  The effect is not permanent.  I must apply it every morning before applying my make-up.  I find it a better alternative to cosmetic surgery.  Some of my friends have had surgery and the results are dreadful.  Using the eye roller, I get the results I want without the high cost and without the possibility of a terrible surgical outcome.  Great product.</li>
    <li> After only 1 use I got terrible allergic reaction: my eyes were really swollen and red bumps had appeared the next day!!! Worst experience ever. I&#x27;m allergic to nickel. I think those 3 little roller balls that this product uses have nickel in the base. Be careful!</li>
    <li> This is the easiest way to help with puffy under eyes. I have extremely sensitive skin and this product was fine. I recommend it highly. Cheap, easy and it works.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me this after hearing one too many complaints from me about the bags under my eyes. I&#x27;m in my seventies. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t expect anything. The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t follow directions and didn&#x27;t push the cap on the other end of the rollers. No results, of course, except rubbing marks under my eyes. I read the box before trying again and had good results, better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before, and I&#x27;ve tried many such products which all seem to be nothing more than  moisturizers. Much of my dark circles disappeared or lessened considerably, and my tired, puffy-eye look appeared smoother--not droopy. I must say I am somewhat surprised. I try a lot of products, and think they are all hype. I&#x27;m glad I am not allergic to any of the ingredients because I want to continue to use this roller. I hope it doesn&#x27;t run dry too soon, I also hope they don&#x27;t take it off the market because. It&#x27;s no surgical eye lift, but at least I can look as if I slept the previous night.</li>
    <li> Love this product.I like what it does for my under eye puffs. I highly recommend this eye cream. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Awesome Price! I noticed a difference in a little over 2 weeks. I will continue to use this product what a great find and deal. Roll n Go! Can&#x27;t be beat. It takes me all of 10 seconds added to my daily routine. Anyone w/ dark circles needs to use this!</li>
    <li> I found this product when I was looking for jade under eye rollers.  This seemed like it would do the same thing, with the added benefit of Olay product.  I used one full tube and liked it but wasn&#x27;t in a hurry to buy again.  After a few weeks though, I realized my eyes were looking tired, so I quickly reordered and I do see a difference.  It rolls on quite nicely.  It is a little hard to control the amount of product dispensed which is why I gave four stars instead of five.  Overall, I like the product very well though and the price is good.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t use this twice a day I am seeing some deep wrinkles begining to even out!! Will continue to use AS DIRECTED!!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  At 62, I think it keeps the skin around my eyes moist and supple.  I had read reviews from people complaining that it burns, but I have never experienced this.  The roller makes it so easy and smooth to apply the product.</li>
    <li> Good product. Day and night.  Scent free for those with sensitivities</li>
    <li> I found that if you have true puffiness under your eyes this product did not work at al It is among other products I have tried for puffiness. I think this is a total rip off..</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s a great way to treat your fine lines without making them worse by having to pat or rub in a cream.  The roller balls are super cool and feel great while helping to reduce and minimize the fine lines under your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year and yes, it works. It works right away! Bye bye puffy eyes!</li>
    <li> It is somewhat early to really rate this product adequately after only using it about a week.&lt;br /&gt;However, It seems to help with keeping the area underneath my eyes less noticeable. I will&lt;br /&gt;Continue it&#x27;s usage, to offer a better assessment.</li>
    <li> I have used other forms of Olay for years, so was looking forward to giving this a try. The first time I used it, I thought my eyes looked puffier underneath but didn&#x27;t think too much about it. After using it three times, under my eyes swelled, and I broke out in an itchy rash under my eyes. There seem to be a number of people with the same reaction, so be aware!</li>
    <li> I used it today when it came in and I was pleased that it was not a gel, it is a soft cream and it feels good on my eyes.</li>
    <li> this really does smooth out the circles.&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed</li>
    <li> DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING--- AND I MEAN NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Greasy feel, did not notice one bit of difference in skin condition after weeks or use</li>
    <li> This leaves your face feeling gross and oily.  It&#x27;s like I am wearing oil around my eyes. From time to time I might wake up from lack of good sleep and find my eyes a little puffy.  This does not work and does not feel good after you apply.  Its heavy and whatever you do - dont attempt to put make up on... You will have it all over within the hour from the way it runs down your eyes.</li>
    <li> Not happy as I did not recieve the original item , what I got is an after market and fake product</li>
    <li> Love it............easy to use, nice for travel.  Will order more.</li>
    <li> The roller can sometimes drag on soft eye tissue. You need to be sure you have pressed the bottom several times first, to release enough product on the roller so it rolls smoothly without pulling.  After all, the idea is to moisturize your delicate eye tissues - so you don&#x27;t want anything pulling/dragging on them.  I would recommend that Olay make a single roller for the eye tissue - instead of this clunky thing.</li>
    <li> Made my eyes puffier. It´s not a cooling roller.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST over-the-counter wrinkle eraser I have yet to find.  This little tube, applied softly under my eyes, after applying all makeup, immediately erases the fine, and even not so fine, wrinkles .  I even use it around my lips to hide fairly deep lines running down from my top and lower lips.  It is fantastic!  Beats other very expensive: Loreal, Shisheido(sp), Estée Lauder, etc.</li>
    <li> This has only been used once, it seem to have ran out in no time.  However, my wife says she willing to try it again.</li>
    <li> I  really like using this product. I use it every day. It is clean &amp; easy to use to apply moisture under your eyes.So glad that Amazon makes it available.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well, but doesn&#x27;t really live up to it&#x27;s promises.</li>
    <li> I found that this works for me and my skin (currently 34 yrs. old). My mom used it and found that it made her under-eyes swell. I am not sure if it is the actual cream or the tool, but when I went a month without using it my lines were much more defined. I don&#x27;t get a lot of sleep and rely on this to make me not look so aged because of it!</li>
