### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but still very impressive lipstick.</li>
      <li>that was a delightful surprise.</li>
      <li>but when i looked in the mirror it still looked perfect!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard the formula is awesome</li>
      <li>One plus is that it smells really good!</li>
      <li>great buy,</li>
      <li>I like applying the lipstick because it smells so good and</li>
      <li>But one time I put on a good coat, blotted and put on another layer</li>
      <li>This is the case with Eternal Rose.  </li>
      <li>the color is so nice.</li>
      <li>but those who look good in rose tones should be able to make it work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 50s and can no longer get away with super bright lipstick.  </li>
      <li>In the tube, it looked much more muted.  </li>
      <li>Women deserve better than to be in essence poisoned by brands we should be able to trust-Maybelline among them.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>There are better brands out there</li>
      <li>Man, if I added up all those loser purchases, I could have some very nice high end makeup.  </li>
      <li>ITS SO COOL!</li>
      <li>I like this lipstick not only for the great color</li>
      <li>the color was slightly bolder than i&#x27;m used to wearing, but it looked amazing with my fair skin.</li>
      <li>Eternal rose is VERY bright pink, almost a hot pink rather than a rose</li>
      <li>but if you are looking for a bright summery pink color at a cheap price, this might work.</li>
      <li>it is very good product but the only thing the color was not what i expected  , still i love it</li>
      <li>the color only looks nice on the  computer screen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even applied it, left in on while I finish up my morning, and then wiped it off for a nice stain.</li>
      <li>i like this one very much the only problem is the color it was darker than the picture but still nice color</li>
      <li>i love wearing this shade with a navy or black top for a contrast of color.</li>
      <li>I top it with gloss for a little more shine.</li>
      <li>The color is nice, the delivery was fast though they did take up a giant box for just one stick.....</li>
      <li>Course I wasn&#x27;t doing a lot of smooching or sweating or any of that ;)</li>
      <li>LOVE HOW LAST AND</li>
      <li>The Eternal Rose color was much, much brighter than I expected.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say much about this formula because I took it off moments after applying it.  </li>
      <li>IT IS VERY STICKY AND LOOKS LIKE</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really like</li>
      <li>, I am very pale and it was FAR too bright on me.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and long lasting on the lips</li>
      <li>pretty much the only lipsticks i ever invest in are ones that promise 12+ hour coverage, and this is probably one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>and it certainly doesn&#x27;&#x27;t last no where close to 14 hours</li>
      <li>Many long lasting lipsticks go on dry</li>
      <li>the cakey/uneven feel it left on my lips and tended to highlight any bits of dry skin more than other brands of lipstick.</li>
      <li>Usually I&#x27;ll just put a light coat of this because I don&#x27;t want to be ALL LIPS.</li>

<li> Color was pretty but at least 3 shades brighter than the picture or the tube.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know about 14 hours, but it does last a long time.</li>
<li> but how long it lasts.  </li>
<li> and i&#x27;d definitely buy this lipstick in other shades.</li>
<li> As you&#x27;d expect from a longwear it is really dry and drying.</li>
<li> /&gt;The color doesn&#x27;t last, it was gone within a few hours</li>
<li> Now I&#x27;ve wasted my money and it will go into the pile of mu I have sitting in a drawer, where the things I don&#x27;t use go to die.  </li>

<li> I did however not like how thick it was on the lips.  </li>
<li> Very, very thick formula.</li>
<li> according to the FDA study I read, Maybelline lipstick boosts the levels of lead in the blood of women who wear this brand--well into &#x27;unhealthy&#x27; territory.&lt;br /</li>
<li> Too bad.  </li>
<li> I hate when drugstore makeup companies make it impossible for consumers to check the color of their products.  </li>
<li> This was horrible, it didn&#x27;t stay on but worst of all that it was thick &amp; got on my teeth....</li>
<li> This is especially frustrating with foundation and lipstick because looks can be deceiving</li>
<li> i hate it.</li>
<li> it was awful.</li>

    <li> LOVE HOW LAST AND THE COLOR ITS SO COOL!</li>
    <li> The lipstick lasts. I top it with gloss for a little more shine. Many long lasting lipsticks go on dry but this one does not. I was pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Would like to buy again and again</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about 14 hours, but it does last a long time. I&#x27;ve even applied it, left in on while I finish up my morning, and then wiped it off for a nice stain. As you&#x27;d expect from a longwear it is really dry and drying. Eternal rose is VERY bright pink, almost a hot pink rather than a rose but those who look good in rose tones should be able to make it work.</li>
    <li> The color is nice, the delivery was fast though they did take up a giant box for just one stick.....&lt;br /&gt;The color doesn&#x27;t last, it was gone within a few hours and I mean like within 3 hours and fades easily as well transfers just as must as any other lipstick.</li>
    <li> The color is nothing like the screen . I love the smell and long lasting on the lips</li>
    <li> We went to a wedding and it came off. the lipstick went all over their dinnerware . it was awful. i hate it. the color only looks nice on the  computer screen.</li>
    <li> I didnt like this color, I am very pale and it was FAR too bright on me.  In terms of staying power, this lipstick HAS IT!  I did however not like how thick it was on the lips.  I wanted to take it off immediately.</li>
    <li> I like this lipstick not only for the great color but how long it lasts.  Even after I eat I don&#x27;t have to rush to the ladies room to renew my lipstick-it is Superstay!</li>
    <li> NEVER AGAIN WOULD I PURCHASE THIS .... IT IS VERY STICKY AND LOOKS LIKE HECK ON.  NEVER AGAIN.  STICK TO WHATEVER IT IS YOU&#x27;VE USED FOR AGES.</li>
    <li> LIP STICK DOES NOT LAST 4 HRS</li>
    <li> it is very good product but the only thing the color was not what i expected  , still i love it</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a bit brighter but it is not, have to wear it with a sheen.  and it certainly doesn&#x27;&#x27;t last no where close to 14 hours</li>
    <li> i like this one very much the only problem is the color it was darker than the picture but still nice color</li>
    <li> I like applying the lipstick because it smells so good and the color is so nice. However it does not stay for up to 14 hours. I was expecting it  to stay longer although i can recommend this.</li>
    <li> If you want saturated color this is it. Usually I&#x27;ll just put a light coat of this because I don&#x27;t want to be ALL LIPS. But one time I put on a good coat, blotted and put on another layer and I swear it lasted until the next morning! Course I wasn&#x27;t doing a lot of smooching or sweating or any of that ;) but still very impressive lipstick.</li>
    <li> The Eternal Rose color was much, much brighter than I expected.  In the tube, it looked much more muted.  I&#x27;m in my 50s and can no longer get away with super bright lipstick.  I can&#x27;t say much about this formula because I took it off moments after applying it.  However, my lips did retain a bit of a stain so maybe that&#x27;s a testament to its staying power.  I hate when drugstore makeup companies make it impossible for consumers to check the color of their products.  This is especially frustrating with foundation and lipstick because looks can be deceiving and they can look one way in the bottle/tube and be completely different once you open them.  This is the case with Eternal Rose.  Now I&#x27;ve wasted my money and it will go into the pile of mu I have sitting in a drawer, where the things I don&#x27;t use go to die.  Man, if I added up all those loser purchases, I could have some very nice high end makeup.  Too bad.  But I&#x27;m not giving up.  I want to try the coral shade in this lipstick.  I&#x27;ve heard the formula is awesome so I&#x27;ll just hope the coral shade works for me.  If it does, I&#x27;ll update this review.  For now, this lipstick gets three stars.</li>
    <li> pretty much the only lipsticks i ever invest in are ones that promise 12+ hour coverage, and this is probably one of my favorites. the color was slightly bolder than i&#x27;m used to wearing, but it looked amazing with my fair skin. i love wearing this shade with a navy or black top for a contrast of color. when i was eating or if i touched my lips, it would immediately come off, and after lunch i thought that it must&#x27;ve been entirely ruined... but when i looked in the mirror it still looked perfect! that was a delightful surprise. great buy, and i&#x27;d definitely buy this lipstick in other shades.</li>
    <li> Very, very thick formula. Didn&#x27;t really like the cakey/uneven feel it left on my lips and tended to highlight any bits of dry skin more than other brands of lipstick. Color was pretty but at least 3 shades brighter than the picture or the tube. One plus is that it smells really good! There are better brands out there but if you are looking for a bright summery pink color at a cheap price, this might work.</li>
    <li> This was horrible, it didn&#x27;t stay on but worst of all that it was thick &amp; got on my teeth....which was pointed out to me by someone else...embarrassing!</li>
    <li> According to FDA reports, Maybelline brand is among the top four worst offenders re: putting lead in their lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt; Just to clarify, ANY amount of lead is detrimental to the health of the person who ingests it..according to the FDA study I read, Maybelline lipstick boosts the levels of lead in the blood of women who wear this brand--well into &#x27;unhealthy&#x27; territory.&lt;br /&gt; Women deserve better than to be in essence poisoned by brands we should be able to trust-Maybelline among them.</li>
