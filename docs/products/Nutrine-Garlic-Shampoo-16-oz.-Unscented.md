      <li>and it is totally more hair.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Since it is sulfate free, I&#x27;ve found it lathers better with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t be sure, but I think its making my hair grow a bit faster too</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>not even sure if this thing works</li>
      <li>This product is very very good, can&#x27;t stress it enough.</li>
      <li>but nothing seem to work, so I decided to search the net for any garlic product, being that I was taught from home remedies that garlic is very good for alot of things, that can be solve from home instead of going to a doctor, then I came across this garlic shampoo and decided to give it a try</li>
      <li>Though the product said a time frame of about six months Im happy with the results thus far.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t excited about paying the shipping and handling since it was more than the item.</li>
      <li>I have to say that although the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic, the smell is quite strong, like strong perfume.</li>
      <li>It really combats FLEAS but leave my dogs hair nourished and soft with a wonderful clean smell.  </li>
      <li>My hair type is fine to medium thickness.</li>
      <li>I received this package quite quickly, and it was securely and nicely packaged considering that it was only a bottle of shampoo in the package :).</li>
      <li>bottle is VERY large!</li>
      <li>This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve found so far that work&#x27;s for very dry scalp.</li>
      <li>Other than that, the shampoo itself smelled great.</li>
      <li>Im not going bald or anything or even loose a lot of hair in the shower but this stuff will make your hair grow so much better and cleans my scalp better than anything ive used before.</li>
      <li>I got a little bit of growth in the front and it looked like fly aways</li>
      <li>Loved it so much I suggested it to my sister in law who has the same problem as I do.</li>
      <li>so it was well worth the money</li>
      <li>Beyond worth it.</li>
      <li>I was able to find this at many local stores for much cheaper..</li>
      <li>I think this is the best product so far for those having problem of hair loss, you may notice a huge difference at the begining, you have to use it regularly, i noticed after a month of using this shampoo that my hair loss is much much less than before , i strongly recommend this shampoo</li>
      <li>yeah right).</li>
      <li>The smell lingers in your hair right after washing and drying, and dissipates a couple of days after.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 19 and had some hair falling out in the shower and a bit throughout the day (which is normal), but I wanted to minimize my losses because I already have fine hair</li>
      <li>But this stuff is quite the opposite and very strongly scented.</li>
      <li>the chemical in this shampoo is too strong, the hair near my hairline are falling out.</li>
      <li>When I first started I did it according to the directions on the label</li>
      <li>, this is my first review haven&#x27;t tried the product yet.</li>
      <li>but i think this will not prevent loosing hair but overall okay to use</li>
      <li>I can not say for sure if it will prevent hair loss, but what I can say is that although I have only used it once, I see a change in my hair already.</li>
      <li>I like this shampoo because I have used it in the past and find that it&#x27;s extremely good for stopping hair breakage.</li>
      <li>what&#x27;s best about it, is that it doesn&#x27;t have all the extra chemicals that normal shampoo&#x27;s do, and it helps to prevent excessive dandruff.</li>
      <li>, good to mention that this shampoo last for a long time.</li>
      <li>The result is for real my sister said my hair grows longer and faster than before</li>
      <li>It is very affordable also for me.</li>
      <li>Hope my review was very helpful.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>my hair is also much dryer now</li>
      <li>Okay, I purchased this product to help with the extreme shedding and breakage I have been experiencing.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and pretty thin especially on the top of my head.</li>
      <li>BUT believe it or not I seriously grew more hair after 1 month use of this product, and my hair feel less oily.</li>
      <li>I damaged my hair by dyeing it and teasing it and straightening/curling it a lot through high school.</li>
      <li>My hair is very curly and does not require frequent shampooing.  </li>
      <li>It does not have sulfates, so it does not lather like normal shampoos.</li>
      <li>but I normally stick to ethnic products and</li>
      <li>I have no complaint about this product it does just like it says ...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s super long</li>
      <li>I have taken my grandkids to the doctors for this very dry scalp problem that won&#x27;t go away, we tried the doctors prescription many times and various shampoo&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this shampoo and used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
      <li>After the first use my hair became stronger and I had essentially NO hair loss in the shower.  </li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find any at stores near me!</li>
      <li>This helped, isn&#x27;t completely gone yet but still!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say personally how this product works as they have been gifts to my sisters who live abroad.</li>
      <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t cause your scalp to dry out like other shampoos which I like and overall just a good product</li>
      <li>It does however, leave my hair feeling soft, manageable, and shiny.</li>
      <li>But as far as I know they&#x27;re seeing some results.</li>
      <li>So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I now have long,healthy soft hair.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve used this product twice so far.</li>
      <li>I will continue to repurchase unless I find an all natural garlic shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I do not use this product as frequent as required.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d try it again, this time dry my hair first.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I tried to brush my hair back from my face while it was still wet and large clumps of hair came out in the brush.</li>
      <li>I recently had a problem with a lot of hair loss, which is the main reason why I purchased this shampoo.</li>
      <li>If you deep condition I recommend using this product first, and then deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone which I&#x27;m already spreading the word around to my friends that have kids with the same problem.</li>
      <li>After 2 weeks of use, I noticed the itching had calm down.  </li>
      <li>This product did not work for me as I had to actually blow dry my hair FIRST before running a brush or comb through it.</li>
      <li>My hair breaks a lot generally because of the color and straightening processing regime</li>
      <li>I took one star off because it contains sulfates, if it were all natural it would be a big five stars!  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, after using this product, my hair is like EXTRA soft.  </li>
      <li>Okay so I was worried it would arrive broken or leaking</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i brought this shampoo after i read the reviews online and on amazon i have been using this product a little bit longer than 6 weeks and although it has made my hair thicker it hasnt stopped the shedding so im a bit disappointed now in trying aloe vera juice, hope it works</li>
    <li> I received this package quite quickly, and it was securely and nicely packaged considering that it was only a bottle of shampoo in the package :). The product on the otherhand does not smell like garlic, which is a good thing, but I&#x27;ve just started using the shampoo so I still have to wait and see if the product does what it says it does. Overall, good customer service and will buy again from this seller :D</li>
    <li> My hair type is fine to medium thickness. It is wavy and very dry. My scalp is dry as well. This product did not help with hair fallout as recommended to me elsewhere. Hair fallout was about the same; however I noticed the quality (texture, shine, color) of my hair was slightly diminished.</li>
    <li> After I had my daughter, I saw that i had some hair loss. So i started taking vitamins and did some research online. I read a lot about garlic shampoo but I couldn&#x27;t find any at stores near me! Wasn&#x27;t excited about paying the shipping and handling since it was more than the item. But honestly it works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and my hair is fuller, thicker, longer, and not falling out any more. Beyond worth it.</li>
    <li> I do not use this product as frequent as required. My hair is very curly and does not require frequent shampooing.  I use this product one a week.  I have felt a difference in my hair.  It feels thicker.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work for me since I read a lot of positive reviews :(  This dried up my hair and didn&#x27;t seem to help with my excessive hair loss. I am highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> This shampoo, even when used with it&#x27;s conditioner, is drying. Leaves hair feeling like you&#x27;ve washed it with dish liquid temporarily. It does make my hair slightly thicker so it was well worth the money</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a year every other day.&lt;br /&gt;My wife and myself think that my hair loss has been stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Also, good to mention that this shampoo last for a long time. I&#x27;m currently using my second bottle after one year.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of good reviews about this shampoo, I decided to give it a try for my itchy scalp and hair loss. After 2 weeks of use, I noticed the itching had calm down.  My scalp still itches but not like it was before.  Much less now.  About the hair loss, I still have fall outs.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t use it long enough.  I will continue another 4 weeks and see how it goes.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shampoo and used it for the first time yesterday. I am hispanic and have long, curly hair (not thick or thin, in between). It did not smell like garlic at all and had a nice scent to it. I like to smell my shampoo on my hair throughout the day and I did with this shampoo. I can not say for sure if it will prevent hair loss, but what I can say is that although I have only used it once, I see a change in my hair already. It seems fuller (even my fiance commented on how much fuller it looked), its softer, and less strands of hair fall out throughout the day. I recently had a problem with a lot of hair loss, which is the main reason why I purchased this shampoo. Usually if I run my hands through my hair, at least 3-6 strands would fall out, EVERY TIME. But almost immediately after using the shampoo, only 1 or no strands at all come out. I am going to continue using the shampoo as recommended and will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Since using this product I have noticed less shedding.  I lather up and let it sit for a bit then continue with my hair routine. So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to note, you may want to check your local beauty supply or pharmacy to see if they carry this product.  I was able to find this at many local stores for much cheaper..</li>
    <li> I received this product a couple of weeks ago and have used it 3/4 times. I have to say that although the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic, the smell is quite strong, like strong perfume. The smell lingers in your hair right after washing and drying, and dissipates a couple of days after.  My initial thought is that it doesn&#x27;t work as well for hair loss as it claims, but I will follow the directions until the shampoo finishes to gauge that. It does however, leave my hair feeling soft, manageable, and shiny.</li>
    <li> I was looking for Unscented Shampoo and Conditioner because of asthma and COPD But this stuff is quite the opposite and very strongly scented. Smells nice but strong. I understand its unscented garlic but the discription lead me to believe the products were totally unscented.     Nutrine Garlic Conditioner Unscented 16 oz.   Nutrine Garlic Shampoo Unscented 16 oz.</li>
    <li> Mad my hair shed like crazy I&#x27;m never buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased garlic retail shampoos from stores and they are expensive. Although I like the smell of garlic shampoo, this shampoo smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 19 and had some hair falling out in the shower and a bit throughout the day (which is normal), but I wanted to minimize my losses because I already have fine hair and I&#x27;m growing it out.  After the first use my hair became stronger and I had essentially NO hair loss in the shower.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months now and have a less hair loss than before I started using it.  I can&#x27;t be sure, but I think its making my hair grow a bit faster too :) I took one star off because it contains sulfates, if it were all natural it would be a big five stars!  I will continue to repurchase unless I find an all natural garlic shampoo.  Another plus is that its a lot of shampoo for a good price, woohoo!</li>
    <li> I damaged my hair by dyeing it and teasing it and straightening/curling it a lot through high school. I was very young and naive but of course I now regret it but I was left with split ends,dry brittle,damaged hair. I cut all my long hair off and decided to start over. I used this product and it helped tremenduously. I now have long,healthy soft hair. I only use this once or twice a month though. When I first started I did it according to the directions on the label but then kinda started doin my own thing.</li>
    <li> Okay, I purchased this product to help with the extreme shedding and breakage I have been experiencing.  I have been using the product for 5 weeks now and I still have the same problems with extreme shedding/breakage.  HOWEVER, after using this product, my hair is like EXTRA soft.  I know there are a lot of hair products that can be used on any and all types of hair but I normally stick to ethnic products and when I researched this product, I didn&#x27;t know if the reviews were based on that, I just bought it.  I like how it softens my hair.  I usually relax my hair every 6 to 8 weeks and by the six week, I struggle to make it to the next week. Since using this product, I am almost at week 6 and it doesn&#x27;t appear that it&#x27;s almost time for the relaxer.  My opinion is that it is a great shampoo and conditioner, the smell, even thought unscented, smell fresh and clean and your hair feels GREAT!</li>
    <li> hey guys,    This shampoo isn&#x27;t going to stop your hair loss and grow more hair over night, however what it can do is help slow down the process. I also found it to prevent dandruff that my minoxidil had caused. I tried a lot of anti dandruff shampoo&#x27;s, and even though this isn&#x27;t marketed for that reason, it sure helps a great deal.  use it every other day in combination with your regular shampoo and conditioner. So overall, it does make your hair loss slow down, and makes your hair look thicker to boot. what&#x27;s best about it, is that it doesn&#x27;t have all the extra chemicals that normal shampoo&#x27;s do, and it helps to prevent excessive dandruff.</li>
    <li> My hair was very weak and was falling out so I decided to try this shampoo. Ive been using it for over six months and it works great. My hair is longer and stronger and I definitely recommend it if you have very weak thin hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product but its not like unacceptable so I will go with it. I have very fine hair and pretty thin especially on the top of my head. It always look flat when my hair grows longer as they would get down. BUT believe it or not I seriously grew more hair after 1 month use of this product, and my hair feel less oily. As I am an oily person if I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday I feel the oils would weight my hair down for even just a day. But after this shampoo my hair totally transform. The result is for real my sister said my hair grows longer and faster than before and it is totally more hair. I totally recommend this for person who have thin hair, but keep that in mind this shampoo would dry your hair for sure just like all the shampoos out there that claim to promote hair growth. So just a conditioner that can really moisture your hair, that way you won&#x27;t tear your hair when you comb it due to the dryness.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say personally how this product works as they have been gifts to my sisters who live abroad. But as far as I know they&#x27;re seeing some results.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best product so far for those having problem of hair loss, you may notice a huge difference at the begining, you have to use it regularly, i noticed after a month of using this shampoo that my hair loss is much much less than before , i strongly recommend this shampoo plus i didnt notice any side effects of using it.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve found so far that work&#x27;s for very dry scalp. I have taken my grandkids to the doctors for this very dry scalp problem that won&#x27;t go away, we tried the doctors prescription many times and various shampoo&#x27;s but nothing seem to work, so I decided to search the net for any garlic product, being that I was taught from home remedies that garlic is very good for alot of things, that can be solve from home instead of going to a doctor, then I came across this garlic shampoo and decided to give it a try and I did. I must say since I used it that I haven&#x27;t seen the whity dry scalp anymore in their hairs. I would highly recommend this product to anyone which I&#x27;m already spreading the word around to my friends that have kids with the same problem. Please try this product along with the conditioner also, the garlic oil is very good for cuts, pimples, bruises, etc. only thing the oil can&#x27;t be shipped to the virgin islands. This product is very very good, can&#x27;t stress it enough. Hope my review was very helpful. Have a blessed day.

    <li> Loved it so much I suggested it to my sister in law who has the same problem as I do. It definitely doesn&#x27;t cause your scalp to dry out like other shampoos which I like and overall just a good product</li>
    <li> Basically this shampoo is like the pink hand soap that you use in a public restroom.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because a coworker recommended it when my edges started thinning. I used it but not enough to comment on the hair growth, but I can say that I found the times I used it that it dried my hair out really bad. So, when I did use it I would do one wasj with the garlic shampoo and another wash with coconut shampoo to help rehydrate. I will use it from time to time, but will not purchase anymore.</li>
    <li> When I received this product the company did not seal the opening. The product had leaked onto my receipt and box causing me to lost ¼ of the product. I email the company and had no replies back. Other than that, the shampoo itself smelled great. Sort of like a baby powder scent. I have overall thin asian hair and wanted to reduce my hair from falling out. I have seen a little difference.  But love the feel of my hair after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my hair has been shedding like crazy for YEARS! I&#x27;d heard of garlic shampoo, but felt like buying it would be a bit of overkill. I mean, can a shampoo REALLY help with shedding? Well, then I washed my hair and clumps were coming out. I mean, this is normal for me since I wash my hair once a week (gross, I know, but it&#x27;s super long and it&#x27;s a hassle to wash every day) and humans tend to shed 100 hairs a day (which means I&#x27;m losing 700 every time I shampoo, since I only shampoo once a week), but it&#x27;s gotten a bit excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You DO NOT need a lot of product when shampooing! I learned this the hard way. It does not have sulfates, so it does not lather like normal shampoos. I mean, it DOES lather, but in a very different way (if that even makes sense?). You I have waist length hair that I wash in 4 sections. I use a quarter size amount shampoo for each section and it lathers nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you USE WARM WATER with this product. Since it is sulfate free, I&#x27;ve found it lathers better with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this product does DRY YOUR HAIR OUT. I deep conditioned before I used this product and it literally felt like my hair was stripped of ALL moisture! If you deep condition I recommend using this product first, and then deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is VERY large! But be careful, my bottle was not completely sealed. Only a little product came out, but with warmer weather coming around I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if bottles started bursting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good! I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Im not going bald or anything or even loose a lot of hair in the shower but this stuff will make your hair grow so much better and cleans my scalp better than anything ive used before. Add the conditioner and your setup is perfect.</li>
    <li> This shampoo helped my hair be stronger, so I have lost fewer hairs and has helped my scalp. I&#x27;ve bought tons of dandruff shampoos but never helped at all. This helped, isn&#x27;t completely gone yet but still! The smell it&#x27;s bad. It does have a scent incase you were wondering( I saw some comments where people thought there wasn&#x27;t one) It smells good to me. I love it. WIll repurchase!</li>
    <li> good thins is that there is No smell to it and i&#x27;m not sure yet but i think this will not prevent loosing hair but overall okay to use i guess.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me as I had to actually blow dry my hair FIRST before running a brush or comb through it. The first time I used it, I tried to brush my hair back from my face while it was still wet and large clumps of hair came out in the brush. I was horrified - but everybody had such glowing reviews about how it preserved and thickened their hair I thought I&#x27;d try it again, this time dry my hair first. That worked o.k. but it took a long time for the hair I lost to fill back in. Eventually this shampoo started making my hair heavy and oily so I just flushed the rest of the bottle. Maybe it is my metabolism or something that is incompatible with the formula of this shampoo. It was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo because I have used it in the past and find that it&#x27;s extremely good for stopping hair breakage. My hair breaks a lot generally because of the color and straightening processing regime I put it through and find this shampoo the best for the purpose.  I have tried other shampoos and notice a lot of my hair comes out in the wash. Of late, I could not find the Nutrine Garlic shampoo anywhere in the stores where I purchased it in the past so I was happy to find it on Amazon. The same goes for all of the Nutrine products such as the Conditioners and the scented and uncented hair products.</li>
    <li> This product really helped my hair grow but the only bad thing is that it left my hair really dry, especially at the ends.</li>
    <li> I been using this for a month, but have no idea if it works. It doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic at all... I guess the closest smell is like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;**Update** I stopped using this because it&#x27;s making my scalp dry and breakout, which is weird because my scalp never breaks out. This has happened twice now, as I stopped using for a month or two then tried again and got same problem.</li>
    <li> I got this because I heard that it is suppose to make your hair grow more. I think I used it for a little less than a year and the bottle was almost gone before I decided to stop using it all together. I got a little bit of growth in the front and it looked like fly aways but that was all. I think it might work for people but it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I did not use it yet, the package just delivered this afternoon and the bottle was leaking....</li>
    <li> Okay so I was worried it would arrive broken or leaking but honestly it was perfectly wrapped and in perfect condition and was as described, this is my first review haven&#x27;t tried the product yet.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this product twice so far. it burned my scalp. i felt pain all over my scalp when i comb my hair. the chemical in this shampoo is too strong, the hair near my hairline are falling out.</li>
    <li> At the suggestion of a friend I wanted to try this shampoo for my thinning hair.  Though the product said a time frame of about six months Im happy with the results thus far.  My only hang up is the product is not readily available at your local store (beauty or health) so its hard to avoid the charges and shipping knew there was a catch..</li>
    <li> did not help with the shedding and my hair still smells like garlic (unscented yeah right). does not work. i wish i never ordered this. my hair is also much dryer now</li>
    <li> not even sure if this thing works</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times and have recommended this to my friends.  Not only do I use it for myself but my five Shih Tzu animals.  It really combats FLEAS but leave my dogs hair nourished and soft with a wonderful clean smell.  I have no complaint about this product it does just like it says ...WORKS</li>
    <li> I love garlic shampoo cause it makes my hair thicker and not fall out.  It is very affordable also for me.</li>
