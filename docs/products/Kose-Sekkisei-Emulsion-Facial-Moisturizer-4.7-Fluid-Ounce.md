      <li>It&#x27;s a ok product I&#x27;ll say.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin, so most moisturizers are too heavy for me, but Sekkisei is the perfect weight.  </li>
      <li>As always this is a pricey product, but it&#x27;s pretty effective in keeping your skin radiant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for daily use for night and day.</li>

      <li>The smell is really good and its not greasy or sticky, it just absorb into ur skin in just a few minute.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin types but wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for those who have dry skin, if you are normal to oily skin</li>
      <li>but I am positive about it.</li>
      <li>Keeps my dry skin moisturized for most of the day.</li>

      <li>/&gt;It has a very runny texture, not nearly as thick as moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Left skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>i had high expectation for the product</li>
      <li>The dark spots from old acne have faded away and, weirdly enough, it feels like more blackheads come out from normal face-washing than normal</li>
      <li>definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants softer skin and to fade away any old flaws.</li>
      <li>This one really surprised my a lot.</li>
      <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen any change in whiten yet</li>
      <li>This is my first time using Japanese facial product.</li>
      <li>I experienced  an bad allergy reaction.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure about this products are real or not....??</li>
<li> In the winter time, this is not as hydrating to last through a dry season.</li>
<li> The price may seem high for a such a small bottle, but it lasts a long time since you only need a small amount.  </li>
<li> I was introduced to Sekkisei Emulsion by my mother quite a few years ago and have used it up until recently when I decided to try other moisturizers.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> You can feel it soak into your skin when you apply it, though it leaves a slight shine to your face (this may be a problem for people with oily skin).  </li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> rather than that, it doesn&#x27;t do worse than the others i&#x27;ve used but not better either.</li>
<li> but it is not a surprising lotion.</li>
<li> It did not improve the skin but made it worse.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is very light, I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months now, in conjunction with the same brand&#x27;s face wash, \\&quot;Junkisui.\\&quot;  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I have oily skin, so most moisturizers are too heavy for me, but Sekkisei is the perfect weight.  The dark spots from old acne have faded away and, weirdly enough, it feels like more blackheads come out from normal face-washing than normal and I&#x27;ve noticed significantly fewer blackheads overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very runny texture, not nearly as thick as moisturizer.  You can feel it soak into your skin when you apply it, though it leaves a slight shine to your face (this may be a problem for people with oily skin).  The price may seem high for a such a small bottle, but it lasts a long time since you only need a small amount.  The bottle I&#x27;ve had for 8 months still has about 30% left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants softer skin and to fade away any old flaws.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this products are real or not....?? Because i used to buy from Japan Kose it was different texture of cream. I got Allergic reaction came out.</li>
    <li> it really help light my spots. I feel different in only one week. nice product to recommend to people who want to reduce spots in the face.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Very lightweight and I expect will be perfect for summer.  Keeps my dry skin moisturized for most of the day.</li>

    <li> love this lotion！has great whitening effect！</li>
    <li> Good stickiness without a face</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a ok product I&#x27;ll say. It contains a lot of alcohol. When I put it on my cheek, my eyes would sense the evaporated alcohol, that hurt. I&#x27;ll prefer you guys try buying something more natural and safe.</li>
    <li> I experienced  an bad allergy reaction. Cannot use it any more. It did not improve the skin but made it worse. I have to stop using it after two days. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It is good for my oily skin. I have not seen the whitening effects yet.  It may take some time.</li>
    <li> It is good for during summer.</li>

    <li> Left skin soft and smooth.  A little goes a long way! Currently using the wash, emulsion and mask.  All products are great!!</li>
    <li> MY SKIN FEEL GOOD AFTER USING IT</li>
