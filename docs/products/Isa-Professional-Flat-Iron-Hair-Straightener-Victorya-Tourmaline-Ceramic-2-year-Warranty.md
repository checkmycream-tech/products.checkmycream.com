<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very fine, very thick hair that is difficult to manage.  I usually wear it freakishly long just because it&#x27;s easier to put it up or pull it back to look neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Victorya 1 Step Flat Iron has changed my life to the point I just had six inches of hair cut off.  The Victorya heats super fast.  I plug it in, and by the time I&#x27;ve rounded up a brush and a styling product, it&#x27;s ready to go.  It has a brain.  There&#x27;s no guessing as to what setting to use, it operates at the optimal setting for any hair. That&#x27;s vaguely creepy (how does it know?) but in the era of Smartphones and Google Maps, I guess the science fiction factor isn&#x27;t all that weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Victorya leaves my hair glossy, straight (you can make curls and waves with it, too), and looking like I just stepped out of the salon.  The effects last for a couple of days, too.  I&#x27;m confident that I&#x27;m not damaging my hair, and best of all, styling takes no more time than hunting up a barrette, hair elastic, or headband used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time in years I&#x27;ve felt comfortable wearing my hair down.  There is no higher praise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
    <li> Wow, this was awesome. It is super easy to use and instructions were great, Nice texture and hair was super straight. Liked the fact that grip was good! A sample was provided but my review is based on its usage.</li>
    <li> This was probably the worst straightener I have ever used. It took me twice as long to straighten my hair, and it left it looking frizzy, with a lot of flyways - which I have never had with any other straightener. My main complaint was not being able to control the heat. I felt like it barely got that hot. I returned it and bought a $35 Remington straightener, and it is SOO much better. Do yourself the favor and DON&amp;#34;T buy this straightener. Worst $118 I ever spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the Remington I bought and will recommend to everyone!! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BB8ZHOE/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> Easy to use and quick for doing a lot of hair. I have curly/wavy medium thick hair and this works like a breeze. i like the non slip grip surface and the bright red plate which makes it easy to see all the hair when clamped inside. The LED inside the handle lights up to indicate that it&#x27;s on, but doesn&#x27;t keep blinking like some irons which is a pet peeve of mine.</li>
    <li> This straightener works wonders! I have poofy wavy hair and i had a crappy old chi straightener which didnt even get my hair as straight. Once i got this ISA Victorya Flat Iron Hair Straightener i tried it, and it worked great. my hair was super straight and i couldn&#x27;t be happier. All you have to do is separate your hair into layers and straighten it. buying this straightener was the greatest thing that has happened to my hair. I highly recommend everyone who needs a great straightener to get this product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this flat iron based on the great reviews and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  I have thick wavy to curly hair that is just to my shoulders.  My first annoyance is that the screw at the base of the plates is rough and my hair kept getting caught on the plastic around the screw.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any flat iron and I&#x27;ve own numerous flat irons over the years, cheap to expensive and this has never been an issue.  Secondly, it took a lot of effort to get my hair flat ironed.  I always divide my hair into section and layers.  It took multiple passes to get my hair somewhat straight.  Definitely not pin straight.  I don&#x27;t think it heats up enough for me.  I&#x27;m currently using my daughter&#x27;s cheap flat iron because I lost my good one in Mexico while on vacation.  She hates her iron and even it is better than this one.  Mine looked a little beat up and I suspect I got a return item.  The edges on the flat iron looked like they had product on them.  I&#x27;ve never returned anything I purchased on Amazon, so I guess I&#x27;ve had a pretty good run.  Now I have to figure out how to do it.  Drat!  It&#x27;s the holidays and I still don&#x27;t have a flat iron that works.  I had high hopes for this one!</li>
    <li> It is great for straightening your hair, but not so much for rolls.</li>
    <li> I have a tough time with my daughter&#x27;s hair due to the coarse texture.  Therefore, I was at 1st hesitant to spend much on a flat iron to find out I would be disappointed with still dealing with the frustrating task of using a straight comb every morning.  I found the right flat iron this time with the ISA Professional and the cost has definitely paid off because it has made my life ALOT EASIER.  I highly recommend and I love the fact it has a no-tangle cord as well.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron i have ever used. I love that it makes my hair smooth and not frizzy like other products. I have had this flat iron for a few weeks and i love it. I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with the product at all. This beats buying a new flat iron every few weeks. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a metal straighten.  This straightener makes my hair smoother and does not get tangled and break off my hair.  Heats up very quickly (I plug it in before I brush my teeth and it heats up well before I am finished). Wish I would have bought this years ago.</li>
    <li> Very pleased that I bought ISA and not anything else ,it works perfect to my curly hair, straight ,fast and easy to do it by yourself.</li>
    <li> This straightener does the job and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair -- but I don&#x27;t like not knowing what temperature the straightener is at either. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as my regular straightener, the Sedu, but it does work. It glides smoothly through the hair and leaves it with a lot of shine. This product would work best for someone who doesn&#x27;t have overly curly hair and just wants to smooth their hair rather than actually try to straighten out curls.</li>
    <li> My flat Iron that I already have that was half the price works so much better. This flat iron is nothing special.  Not happy!</li>
    <li> If I could give this product TEN stars, I would!  I have long, naturally curly hair that is a pain to get straight.&lt;br /&gt;This iron actually straightens my hair on the first attempt without me having to guess what setting to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have received SO many compliments on my hair since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is I NEVER have accidentally turned the iron off because the on/off switch is awkwardly placed.&lt;br /&gt;The iron also swivels without the cord getting in the way which makes the process of getting through all of my hair so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, LOVE this iron!</li>
    <li> I recommend this hair straightener to anyone who is looking to buy one! My wife is so happy with that.</li>
    <li> Wow! I needed a new straightener because my old one broke on me and burned my hair a lot. Then I found this. It made my hair look and feel silky after I straighten it. Not only does this straightener adjusts its temperature to my hair but it does not burn it! I can also make curls and wavy shapes with it too! There are some parts of my hair that’s stubborn to straighten but it handled my stubborn parts just fine. I really like how the cord doesn’t get tangled either. Finally! Tangled cords are annoying. Best purchase ever! It makes those beautiful bouncy curls easy to make.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to take on a trip because my everyday use iron was a bit too bulky. Its extremely versatile since it can be used on any voltage, so you can avoid using adapters, as long as the plug fits. This has now become my go to flat iron at home as well, even though the plates are smaller than my old one, this model gets the job done just as fast and leaves my hear looking shinier. Overall a great buy!</li>
    <li> This hair iron is amazing!! It works great on frizzy, unmanageable hair (summertime humidity hair be gone...). It has an automatic heat adjustment which is amazing even though I don&#x27;t have any idea how on earth it can do that. It looks sleek and I know that isn&#x27;t a big deal, but it&#x27;s always a plus when nice things look nice, too. You can also use it to curl your hair just by wrapping your hair around the iron or changing the direction you move it through your hair. It has a two year warranty, so if something goes wrong you can just send it back, no problem. It&#x27;s really quite amazing. Bottom line: I would at least give this a try before you go and buy some of the more expensive hair irons.</li>
    <li> I like it but I do not like that it does not have tempature setting.</li>
    <li> Such a neat straightening iron. Love the look of it and it works well making my frizzy hair look nice and sleek.</li>
    <li> I got this straightener for Christmas, and I have used it at least a dozen times since then. I left my old one in a hotel bathroom about a month ago, so my husband got me this one. I am very happy with it! The automatic smart temperature feature is amazing, and it does both straight hair and curls with ease. The quality of the product is obviously very high, but I also love the idea of having a two year warranty. Great product!</li>
    <li> It worked when $20.00 ones failed, And that makes my kid happy... However I do not see over 100 bucks here. It only came in a basic box with no storage bag...Should toss in some goodies for that price. But I am a guy so I probably do not see the value.</li>
    <li> Overall the product is great. I only wish the ironing plates were a little bigger. I am very pleased they don&#x27;t snag my hair!</li>
    <li> This professional quality flat iron by ISA is the simplest I&#x27;ve ever used because it automatically adjusts the temperature to my hair! I have no idea how it does this but it works perfectly for every part of my hair and I never have to decide what temperature to set it to. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ISA uses quality materials for their hair care products (I have a couple of others) and this one is no exception. The plates on this iron (which is the critical part that straightens and smooths your hair) are made of solid ceramic that has tourmaline in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat irons can be made with metal plates, ceramic plates or ceramic with tourmaline or titanium plates. Plain metal plates are usually the least expensive and the hardest on your hair. Ceramic is considered far superior because when heated, it emits negative ions which leave straightened hair smooth and glossy and in good condition. Tourmaline emits even more negative ions so when it is included in a ceramic plate, you get increased negative ionization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solid ceramic plate is better than a ceramic coated metal plate because the ceramic coating can easily chip and leave sharp edges that can damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair that is damaged by heated styling, coloring, etc. is susceptible to further damage when lower quality flat irons are used. Since I have coarse, wiry, color-treated hair, I was especially happy to try this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, just plug it in and wait 30 seconds for it to heat up. Using sections of hair from 1-2\\&quot; thick, glide the section of hair through the iron, starting near the roots and working all the way down. Because both of the plates pivot in place, this iron never tugs or pulls on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: if you twist your wrist near the end of each section of hair, you can curl your hair up or under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at how silky smooth my hair feels after using this iron. It&#x27;s much shiner, also. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a couple of weeks and I see no evidence of heat damage at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron is lighter in weight than my other irons, which leaves me with less arm fatigue after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a professional quality flat iron at a reasonable price, this is a great one to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was provided a sample for review, but a positive review was not asked for or promised or implied.ence of heat damage at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron is lighter in weight than my other irons, which leaves me with less arm fatigue after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a professional quality flat iron at a reasonable price, this is a great one to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was provided a sample for review, but a positive review was not asked for or promised or implied.</li>
    <li> Better than all others I have tried and it&#x27;s super easy to work with digital display! It shows the temperature and so easy to control it.It heats up quickly and does not leave my hair damaged at all. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional product, it heats up extremely fast just like it is promised and it straightens the hair properly, unlike those other hair straighteners that false advertise, this one actually works. The ceramic nature makes it just glide smooth and it is easy to hold whilst straightening the hair due to the lightness and portability. Brilliant product and perhaps one of the best hair straightener purchases I’ve made.</li>
    <li> Awesome and good for hair. Makes my hair shiny and frizz free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had frizzy hair for years, but with the ceramic plates on this flat iron I haven&#x27;t had any bad hair days for a while! My hair is also VERY thick and curly, and this handles it pretty well. I&#x27;m impressed with how straight my hair stays throughout the day, typically it crimps back up halfway through. I feel like I just came from the salon, and people have been commenting on how great my hair has been looking recently. I really suggest this flat iron if you have mega frizzy hair like me.</li>
    <li> Hair is shiny and straight so easily.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this flat iron. I have used several different hair straighteners, and this particular one is just perfect.  I like that it is small, but works in a big way. It heats up really quick. I have a lot of hair, and it is really long. I get my hair the way I want it, in half the time. I just love the way my hair feels, and looks after i use this Hair Straightener, especially with the curls I can make at the ends of my hair, giving it some style, and volume.  Great feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also really like the idea that it heats up automatically and adjusts the temperature suitable for my hair type.  The power switch is in the inside of the Iron which is very cool. I have used products where the buttons are on the outside of the device, and I  always hit them, and mess with the temp of the iron. Which can be pretty annoying. Every time I use this I feel like I have just left the salon.  This is the best easy 1 step flat iron hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the only flat iron I&#x27;ll ever need! It gets your hair straight and makes it all smooth and shiny (not frizzy!). I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s working perfectly, it&#x27;s well made and definitely beats re-buying cheap irons over and over again because they don&#x27;t work or break. Totally recommend, every girl needs this!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener from ISA does an excellent job straightening and shaping hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has state-of-the art 7/8 in. x 3 1/2. floating plates made of tourmaline ceramic, and they heat up fast. What is amazing is that it has some kind of sensor that knows how to keep the heat at the appropriate level, so there is no need to fiddle with temperature settings. I don&#x27;t have any idea how it works, just that it works very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is solid and precise, but the overall weight is only 350g (12.3 oz.), which is light enough to use for hours without strain. The sturdy spring hinge gives precise control. The flat power cable is about 70 in. long and resists tangling. The connector has a 120 degree angle and strain relief, and it swivels infinitely. The plug is polarized and there is an automatic shutoff for safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this hair straightener because it is well-made, works very well, and could not be simpler to use. It is even shipped in packaging that is both frustration-free and attractive. It would make a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ISA provided a hair iron for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> This works for me and am so glad i got it for her,  my girlfriend have been having issues with her hair, her hair is always dropping and makes her sad, ever since i got this for her it now strengthens her hair, with this she choose any style she likes either bouncy curls or glam waves, she is loving it and am loving her hair too. it&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used ISA flat irons in the past and they have done well. This model has the controls on the inside and only allows for on or off. There are no temperature controls. But this comes with something called SMART automatic temperature control. It&#x27;s hard to know if it is really adjusting based on your hair since I&#x27;m not testing the temperature of the output but it does a good job. There is plenty of space on the ceramic plates and they have a lot of give to them (spring action). The cord is long enough and rotates around the end so it never tangles up. It has worked well on my daughter&#x27;s somewhat thinner and sometimes frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I have very kinky, thick, curly hair. I have to have high heat levels to actually get my hair to take the straightening. I have had a bad past with straighteners. But when I used this, I was very pleased. It heats up fast - less than 1 minute from plugging it in. It takes me about 5 minutes to do a quick styling and I&#x27;m out the door. The plates slide smoothly and they don&#x27;t damage my hair. I&#x27;m so impressed with this one.</li>
    <li> I can get the same result for a 1/4 of the price. No! I returned and bought the HAI brand</li>
    <li> I love this new straighter! I have used it for just 1 week and I&#x27;m amazed on how straight it leaves my hair. I us to not like straightening my hair because of how long it took to get it just right but this straighter has been so good to me it straightens my hair 2x faster than any other straightener I&#x27;ve used! I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> The Victorya hair straightener is the easiest ever. It is easy on the eye and does a quick job of getting hair straight or wavy or even curly.&lt;br /&gt;The tips stay cool to the touch so there is no risk of burning. The temperature automatically changes based on hair needs and never burns hair or makes it unhealthy. The tourmaline ceramic is good for sealing cuticles and generating negative ions which fight frizz.</li>
    <li> it works with my hair not against it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron as a gift for my wife, She loves it! It is perfectly safe and comfortable. The included 2 year warranty Is amazing! You definetaly won&#x27;t stumble upon anything like this anywhere else! 5/5 stars! :)</li>
    <li> Nice flat iron!  I have thick  shoulder length curly hair and have a lot of trouble finding an iron that will do the job right.  This iron works great without a lot of work!</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and the ISA amazingly does not get too hot but enough to seal the shafts so they shine  and keep the humidity from frizzing my hair!  My other hot iron ( a Chi ) was too hot for my hair. I really like this flat iron. It also makes beautiful waves.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loved this. Great product and great results. Must have for anyone with frizzy and curly hair. Very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended</li>
