      <li>My hair are very oily usually and this shampoo really helps.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly although some people think it tends to dry your hair</li>
      <li>Along with the other products, it&#x27;s helped my hairline and my hair is much thicker and the back of my head is filling in.</li>
      <li>Do not trust the &amp;#34;Condition: New - for a limited time, free 50ml anaphase included in your purchase&amp;#34;, it is false.</li>

    <li> My experience was great and I would highly recommend your company. I really appreciate your professionalism, I highly appreciate your prompt work!!\\&quot; ... \\&quot;I am fully satisfied\\&quot;. You helped and saved my time.</li>
    <li> In my country Panamá, this Brand dissapear and im happy for found it here !</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. I have thin and very fine hair. I was experiencing more thinning of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately the shampoo made my hair feel and look  healthy with lots of volume.</li>
    <li> This product worked for me- I recommend using it for at least one year to see results- I got lots of baby hair- it dries up a bit your scalp but you can use a good scalp conditioner</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. It helped me a lot with my hair loss! .. I love it and recommended 100%</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo as indicated hair thinning has stopped I currently seeing hair growth is only been 2 weeks and so far great results thicker hair and hair regrowth can wait to see results as i continue to use the shampoo as indicated been using rogaine for many years nothing compare to the use od Ducray stimulating cream shampoo</li>
    <li> this product has a lot of effect on me, I think is great and I recomend it to someone who want to buy the shampoo it is so great, and it is working with me.</li>
    <li> I have a fine and thin hair and this shampoo gives me volume and makes it look healthy. Worth buying the product.</li>
    <li> I wish can put 0 star! But the system doesn&#x27;t Let me. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t Work at all. I lost my money!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome for thinning hair I recommend to any new moms who are having issues with hair loss. Great product. Yay</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans well. I bought it in conjunction with Ducray Neoptide Anti-Hair Loss Treatment. I always try different shampoo&#x27;s and other treatments so I cannot say for certain if one type works better than the other, but this does not cause my hair to fall out. Along with the other products, it&#x27;s helped my hairline and my hair is much thicker and the back of my head is filling in. My only issue is that this shampoo dries out my hair, but not everytime I used it. I only use a small dime-sized amount so it lasts a long time. I bought my bottle in Paris in May, 2014 and it should last me well into the summer before I have to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Good quality and good price</li>
    <li> First time user. It gives my hair volume, but I wish there was a conditioner too.</li>
    <li> I received another shampoo</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because I&#x27;m already using it to help reversed my androgenic alopecia cause by pcos, well when I got the package I was so excited because the one I have at home is almost finish, to my surprise I was shock. I got some kinda shampoo name Glytone. I&#x27;m highly annoyed, how the heck could this seller send me the wrong shampoo. I&#x27;ve already contacted the seller and this issue better get resolve soon #unsatisfied buyer</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  This stuff didn&#x27;t work at all and made my hair and scalp super dry. Might work for others.</li>
    <li> the Product requested is reached perfectly and described it .</li>
    <li> I recommend it. It really Works. I used it in the past and it worked. The only weird thing is the one i just bought smells different. I guess the lab changed it.</li>
    <li> Good price and service</li>
    <li> If you use it and also take biotin zinc and rogaine you would see a good result</li>
    <li> Do not trust the &amp;#34;Condition: New - for a limited time, free 50ml anaphase included in your purchase&amp;#34;, it is false. I am very disappointed for this.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo before and it really works. It gives volume to my hair and helps to keep it from falling. I recommend it highly although some people think it tends to dry your hair but that is exactly what I need to give it volume.</li>
    <li> I received a wrong Shampoo with a damaged box. I have been using this product for two years and It is very good. This seller sent me a different product! Not satisfied at all, now i should send it back and waste my time for seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> This is so good for my very fine hair. I have bought twice now.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for years now. Helps control hair fall. But does dry your scalp, so don&#x27;t over use it. I apply it once every 2 days in small quantities. Make sure you keep your scalp moisturized with good hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> The doctor recommended this shampoo for me for my hair fall/loss along with Chronostim spray. I am in my second week. The shampoo does dry my scalp but makes my hair look fuller. ALthough  the second and third wash it didnt really make it look fuller- my hair was just limp. My hair also got oilier quicker. Not sure if that is due to the shampoo or chronostim spray or pregnacy hormones.&lt;br /&gt;I will update if I notice new hair growth.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo for thin hair....</li>
    <li> The quality of the shampoo is definitely good, but it did not improve the problem of hair loss.</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo, makes hair look clean longer, now I wash them once in two days instead of every day, use it for a month now. My hair are very oily usually and this shampoo really helps. Also came with loads of testers of other stuff, 2 creams and one tester for another anti dandroof shampoo. Good package and service. Very reccommended.</li>
