      <li>However, you have to follow the directions as written and you will be thrilled too!</li>
      <li>I followed directions to get the mouth guard to fit as best as I could.</li>
      <li>Since they didn&#x27;t know I was trying to improve my teeth color, it was a good indicator.</li>
      <li>Make sure if you eat lemons or have apple cider vinegar on your salads to rinse your mouth with water as that acid affects enamel yikes!</li>

      <li>and way better than the strips</li>
      <li>This works great on sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>It is probably better because if you use it too much you could lose enamel or that&#x27;s what I read on the internet.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re on our second tube and both our smiles are getting better and better each day with no sensitivity issues on our teeth or gums.</li>

      <li>Hey...cheap way to an holywood smile.</li>
      <li>so far I can see a heck of a difference comparing my top teeth to the bottom teeth.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll subside after brushing with sensitive tooth</li>
      <li>Two birds, right?</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference right away and have kept using it ever since.</li>
      <li>After our first Plus White tube, he definitely gained confidence to smile and talk more at work and was able to flash a 4-shade whiter teeth.  </li>
      <li>Even within the first two bleachings (15 minutes a piece) I got compliments on my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several teeth whiteners and mostly feel like I got ripped off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products that left my mouth aching for days.</li>
      <li>When I first got it I didn&#x27;t have the plastic mouth retainers</li>
      <li>Talked to my dentist who stated many of these OTC products were much too intense for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>We had tried several whitening toothpastes but none worked for him because some just weren&#x27;t good enough and some were too strong for his sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>The whitening effect is much faster -</li>
      <li>I really like this product and all the whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>I am a coffee drinker and this helps so much.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use strips because of my sensitive teeth, but this gel causes no sensitivity and helps to gradually brighten my smile.</li>
      <li>I lightly brush it on with a toothbrush and leave on for about ten minutes, then rinse off.  </li>
      <li>On the flip-side, I don&#x27;t think the sensitive teeth formula works very well</li>
      <li>Easy to use and economical because you use such a little portion each time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My teeth are very sensitive, but have never had a problem with this product.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend it for anyone with very sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>I just bought 20% Opalescence and did that again (which makes my teeth very sensitive) and</li>
      <li>the first day and again for the second day.  </li>
      <li>so I started using the bleach in my clear retainers.  </li>
      <li>Since I have sensitive teeth, this sensitive formula was perfect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably keep ordering this from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find the Sensitive Teeth formula anywhere where we are.  </li>
      <li>,that made me sensitive years ago</li>
      <li>It was on Amazon, that I found a Sensitive Teeth formulation..</li>
      <li>It did not whiten my teeth, but it not make them sensitive either.</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended this whitening gel specifically because I have sensitive teeth to whitening agents.  </li>
      <li>Went for a professional whitening, and they were dissapointed and told me that I probably wouldn&#x27;t notice much difference after the professional treatment because my teeth were already very white.</li>
      <li>knew my teeth were sensitive but not to this degree.  </li>
      <li>I assumed that since this was the &#x27;Sensitive Teeth&#x27; formula that I would have to use it for twice as long and get less results: WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;I can go for 3-4 days straight of 20mins using pre-formed trays (free from my dentist, thank you) and even though it says 5mins</li>
      <li>The one positive is that my teeth were not sensitive to this gel.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this teeth whitening product especially to smokers.</li>
      <li>Plus + white 5 Miute Speed Whitening Gel...Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;Great for those who bleach often or have sensitive gums or teeth!</li>
      <li>I have natural white teeth, but I wanted them white-white.</li>
      <li>So when I saw Sensitive Teeth Formula of Plus White here in Amazon, I knew we just have to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I have slight sensitivity on my top lip but it&#x27;s a little sore from contact to the bleach.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be advised this product works if you just want to whiten a little, wont do much for major stains.</li>
      <li>I give it 2 stars because i&#x27;m sure it would whiten if my teeth were darkened by coffee or other black things, but mine are just a little bit yellow and thus this product had no effect on my teeth</li>
      <li>I naturally have white teeth, but I have a little bit of yellow near the gumline.  </li>

<li> So far I have not had any sensitivity with this product and my tea stained teeth are definitely less yellow.</li>
<li> Have not used it long enough to rate the whiteng</li>
<li> I read this somewhere: use with a dry brush, hold in mouth for ten minutes then spit it out .</li>
<li> and he said to cycle the use because bleaching can have side effect in the long run.</li>
<li> Learned that one the hard way... live and learn.</li>
<li> Being a twice a day black coffee drinker has done it&#x27;s damage, but it&#x27;s inevitable.</li>

<li> Plain and simple peeps..  </li>
<li> I just end up going longer because I am doing other things that distract me...  </li>
<li> Would recommend, work as well if not better than white strips.</li>
<li> Did this product &#x27;whiten&#x27; my teeth- a little, was it what I expected-</li>
<li> I have VERY sensitive teeth and other teeth whiteners, including some whitening toothpastes, have made my teeth so sensitive it was painful to eat or drink anything.</li>
<li> It never makes my teeth stupid white, the unnatural, extremely over-whitened smile of bleach-aholics.</li>
<li> when I suck in or blow out - I guess it&#x27;s slight sensitivity.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It does feel a little \\&quot;strange\\&quot;</li>
<li> Did nothing, and was messy.</li>
<li> He was a heavy smoker for almost all his life and just quit smoking 4 years ago.  </li>
<li> Those years of nicotine in his mouth left his teeth really in a bad shade, almost like a rusty yellow.  </li>
<li> I usually spread this on after brushing my teeth.  </li>
<li> Noticeably whiter teeth in less than 3 uses!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It seems to be working despite not being able to use it every day.  Would definitely see quicker results if you use morning and night.</li>
    <li> Used this product for 5 min. the first day and again for the second day.  Some whitening noted but my teeth still ache 2 weeks later.&lt;br /&gt;I knew my teeth were sensitive but not to this degree.  Talked to my dentist who stated many of these OTC products were much too intense for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I have sensetive teeth so it seems to work on that part . Have not used it long enough to rate the whiteng but i did use the reguar stuff. I like it better than the strips</li>
    <li> I naturally have white teeth, but I have a little bit of yellow near the gumline.  I decided to try this bleach with moldable mouth pieces (which I accidentally melted) so I started using the bleach in my clear retainers.  Even within the first two bleachings (15 minutes a piece) I got compliments on my teeth.  Since I have sensitive teeth, this sensitive formula was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel a little \\&quot;strange\\&quot; when I suck in or blow out - I guess it&#x27;s slight sensitivity.  But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll subside after brushing with sensitive tooth paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want whiter teeth, this product is for you!</li>
    <li> This works great on sensitive teeth.  It starts working after about 5 minutes.  Best if left on your teeth for about 15 minutes.  But I do like it!</li>
    <li> Plain and simple peeps..  Did this product &#x27;whiten&#x27; my teeth- a little, was it what I expected- No.  Be advised this product works if you just want to whiten a little, wont do much for major stains.</li>
    <li> will order again .really does work. satisfied customer</li>
    <li> Does nothing. Even left on for 20 minutes every day for a week. Took before and after pics and nada.</li>
    <li> Plus + white 5 Miute Speed Whitening Gel...Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;Great for those who bleach often or have sensitive gums or teeth!</li>
    <li> Hey...cheap way to an holywood smile. lol. Works wonderful but just don&#x27;t overdo it. Asked my dentist and he said to cycle the use because bleaching can have side effect in the long run. Google it.</li>
    <li> I read this somewhere: use with a dry brush, hold in mouth for ten minutes then spit it out . You will see a difference. I really like this product and all the whitening toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t do anything&#x3D;but this does. It is not a big tube.</li>
    <li> I am a coffee, cola and tea drinker.  Enough said.  I&#x27;ve tried several teeth whiteners and mostly feel like I got ripped off.  This one actually had some results after a couple weeks of use.  I only know this because I had several people comment on how white my teeth were.  Since they didn&#x27;t know I was trying to improve my teeth color, it was a good indicator.</li>
    <li> I assumed that since this was the &#x27;Sensitive Teeth&#x27; formula that I would have to use it for twice as long and get less results: WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;I can go for 3-4 days straight of 20mins using pre-formed trays (free from my dentist, thank you) and even though it says 5mins I just end up going longer because I am doing other things that distract me...  It is probably better because if you use it too much you could lose enamel or that&#x27;s what I read on the internet. I follow up with brushing with baking soda and voila a noticiably brighter smile. Not as good as a ZOOM treatment that costs hundreds of dollars but for a coffee/wine drinker I am extremely satisfied. Make sure if you eat lemons or have apple cider vinegar on your salads to rinse your mouth with water as that acid affects enamel yikes! Learned that one the hard way... live and learn.</li>
    <li> Did nothing, and was messy. I have tried many products, and not a fan of this one. whitening lightening is better.</li>
    <li> i have tried several store bought products including crest white strips, and also have used Opal Essence purchased through my dentist. This product works the best by far without the sensitivity issues! I love it and highly recommend it. However, you have to follow the directions as written and you will be thrilled too! Noticeably whiter teeth in less than 3 uses!! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this on Thursday, June 16th. I also bought a mouth guard from Modells sporting goods store. I didn&#x27;t realize it was youth size. I followed directions to get the mouth guard to fit as best as I could. I then applied the paste with a Q-tip,applied the guard and wiped off excess that were on my gums. I did that so I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem w/my gums after continuing usage. 2X a day for 20 minutes... so far I can see a heck of a difference comparing my top teeth to the bottom teeth. It&#x27;s only been about 4 days! I have slight sensitivity on my top lip but it&#x27;s a little sore from contact to the bleach.&lt;br /&gt; I cannot wait to start my lower teeth, But I am loving the comparisons between the both. Being a twice a day black coffee drinker has done it&#x27;s damage, but it&#x27;s inevitable. It has also helped me look a lot younger which I love! almost 40 yikes!&lt;br /&gt; I will upkeep once a week after the 2 weeks are up! oh yeah and way better than the strips,that made me sensitive years ago and I never wanted to do that gain plus this is way inexpensive! Mouth guard 5 bucks+ Plus white 7 bucks&#x3D;12 bucks!</li>
    <li> It does work for me and my hubby! He was a heavy smoker for almost all his life and just quit smoking 4 years ago.  Those years of nicotine in his mouth left his teeth really in a bad shade, almost like a rusty yellow.  We had tried several whitening toothpastes but none worked for him because some just weren&#x27;t good enough and some were too strong for his sensitive teeth.  So when I saw Sensitive Teeth Formula of Plus White here in Amazon, I knew we just have to give it a try.  Within a week of twice a day application with a cotton tip and letting it sit for about 10 minutes at a time, my hubby&#x27;s teeth got 2 shades lighter.  After our first Plus White tube, he definitely gained confidence to smile and talk more at work and was able to flash a 4-shade whiter teeth.  We&#x27;re on our second tube and both our smiles are getting better and better each day with no sensitivity issues on our teeth or gums. I&#x27;ll probably keep ordering this from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find the Sensitive Teeth formula anywhere where we are.  I highly recommend this teeth whitening product especially to smokers.</li>
    <li> I have been using this company&#x27;s product for a while now...It was on Amazon, that I found a Sensitive Teeth formulation..I will buy again.</li>
    <li> After i have used it for a week, i havent seen any noticale results. This was suppose to do a quick5 minutes whitening, but never did. That&#x27;s why i give it one star.</li>
    <li> This company is now selling watered diwn versions. Didnt work as it did before</li>
    <li> It did not whiten my teeth, but it not make them sensitive either. I used it as directed (kept it on for 30 minutes 2x a day for 2 weeks in my custom trays). And nothing happened. I have natural white teeth, but I wanted them white-white. I just bought 20% Opalescence and did that again (which makes my teeth very sensitive) and viola, in 3 days white-white. I guess, no pain, no gain.</li>
    <li> I give it 2 stars because i&#x27;m sure it would whiten if my teeth were darkened by coffee or other black things, but mine are just a little bit yellow and thus this product had no effect on my teeth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used crest whitestrips a lot and use the best kind.  Although I like the whitestrips they can cause sensitivity.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product and it&#x27;s results.  Would recommend, work as well if not better than white strips.</li>
    <li> I used it for like a week and it actually works. I would recommend this to anybody who is looking to whiten their teeth. Amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest whitening strips for a while and my gums just always feels sore after use! But not at all with Plus 5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The whitening effect is much faster - I  saw a difference just after two days!&lt;br /&gt;- Very nice on gums!&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use and economical because you use such a little portion each time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best whitening product on the market!</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive teeth and other teeth whiteners, including some whitening toothpastes, have made my teeth so sensitive it was painful to eat or drink anything. So far I have not had any sensitivity with this product and my tea stained teeth are definitely less yellow. Would recommend it for anyone with very sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> I usually spread this on after brushing my teeth.  I lightly brush it on with a toothbrush and leave on for about ten minutes, then rinse off.  My teeth are very sensitive, but have never had a problem with this product.  Have gotten many compliments on the whiteness of my teeth.  Went for a professional whitening, and they were dissapointed and told me that I probably wouldn&#x27;t notice much difference after the professional treatment because my teeth were already very white.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. When I first got it I didn&#x27;t have the plastic mouth retainers so I painted it on with a Q-tip. It helped renew the whiteness to my teeth in no time. I noticed a difference right away and have kept using it ever since. The tube is a great size too! I would definitely be re-ordering this when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this whitening gel specifically because I have sensitive teeth to whitening agents.  The one positive is that my teeth were not sensitive to this gel.  On the flip-side, I don&#x27;t think the sensitive teeth formula works very well (yes I followed the directions).  My teeth don&#x27;t look any whiter and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use strips because of my sensitive teeth, but this gel causes no sensitivity and helps to gradually brighten my smile. Used 2x per day, left on for 20 minutes or so, I see visible results in a few days. It never makes my teeth stupid white, the unnatural, extremely over-whitened smile of bleach-aholics. My naturally shiny teeth look natural, bright, and effortless.</li>
    <li> After one (10 minute) use I could tell a difference. I am a coffee drinker and this helps so much. I&#x27;ve tried so many products that left my mouth aching for days. There was NO sensitivity after I used this. Helpful tip: if you&#x27;re low on time, I recommend using this while you&#x27;re in the shower. Two birds, right?</li>
