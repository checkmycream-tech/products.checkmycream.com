      <li>It&#x27;s huge and feels so great on the lips!</li>
      <li>Using the butter didn&#x27;t make me hungry, which I think is a good thing.</li>
      <li>It also has a lot of product for a good price.</li>
      <li>Successful under and over lipstick, it feels nice and withstands eating and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you like vanilla and slightly sweet scents in your lip products, this is a great one to get!  </li>
      <li>The Vanilla and Macadamia has a very nice scent, has a nice consistency, and makes my lips nice and moist.  </li>
      <li>I hope they never discontinue this product, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
      <li>The flavor is pleasant without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>This lip butter smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice scent of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Also like the nice tin that comes with it-easy to pop in my jean pockets.</li>
      <li>As for the tin, I like it and it fits nicely in my mobile make-up bag.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice texture and creamy</li>
      <li>this is a nice choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a warm vanilla scent that I find quite comforting.  </li>
      <li>I can tell you that this is a really nice one.</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely and melts in leaving a nice moisturized feeling.</li>
      <li>The Shea butter and almond oil are nice additions.  </li>
      <li>Nivea lip butter is a nice moisturizing balm.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not overly enthusiastic about the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I keep the tub kind in the cabinet in my headboard</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice sheen on my lips, with no colour tint.</li>
      <li>Another nice Nivea</li>
      <li>The scent of it is really nice.</li>
      <li>Liked the scent.</li>
      <li>so I have it handy when I am in bed.</li>
      <li>I routinely make my own lip balms to avoid hives.</li>
      <li>Makes them so soft and smells delicious!</li>
      <li>I suppose it&#x27;s more cost effective for them to use the inferior product though.</li>
      <li>And as far as lip balms in a pot go, this is a perfect consistency.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>It is better than those, but not quite as good as the best, at preventing lip dryness for a long time.  </li>
      <li>This product makes that easy, and it has a nice smell and taste that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice consistency while in the tin, doesn&#x27;t melt or get gooey, and is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this product a go, mainly because of the beautiful smell.</li>
      <li>Nivea always make really great products and the lip butter work really well to my daughter&#x27;s lips moisturized and from chapping.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good product that I will happily use to the bottom of the tin.</li>
      <li>They are more hygienic and don&#x27;t entail dabbing your finger in product.</li>
      <li>My favorite lip balm is Aquaphor, which was recommended to me by my doctor.  </li>
      <li>I am not fond of the application method (finger in tin, finger to mouth) because, as a teacher, I have watched too many groups of kids pass these tins around and \\&quot;dig in.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these lip balms.  </li>
      <li>would still prefer a better method of applying it though, like a stick or tube where my fingers wouldn&#x27;t have to be used.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if there was any macadamian nut extract in the product.</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s still a great lip butter to use at night.</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly and leaves a nice sheen on lips.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have any nut allergies just to be on the safe side.</li>
      <li>only problem was that while it does moisturize wonderfully, it doesn&#x27;t leave any barrier.</li>
      <li>And the scent is fabulous!</li>
      <li>I found that a bit interesting.  </li>
      <li>But my favorite part was the taste of the vanilla-which is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I think it is very sheer and delightful to wear on my lips.  </li>
      <li>Which is a complete shame, because shea butter and almond oil are great moisturizers on their own.</li>
      <li>I love this lip butter.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It makes your lips so soft and it feels so good!</li>
      <li>Nivea makes great skin care products, and this one is highly recommended.</li>
      <li>One of the main things that I liked about this product is the SMELL!</li>
      <li>The smell of this is really lovely; it smells more vanilla than macadamia and isn&#x27;t too sweet.</li>
      <li>Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
      <li>Good Product, Fast Delivery.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of those lip butters that doesn&#x27;t take very much to be effective and some seems to be absorbed while some stays on the surface to keep my lips moist for hours.  </li>
      <li>-- so sweet and yummy!</li>
      <li>Easy to take along and find in a purse.</li>
      <li>it comes in is easily packable in purse or pocket.  </li>
      <li>The important thing is that this product works.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one that I don&#x27;t have to reapply very often which is nice.</li>
      <li>This product was nice because it did not feel real greasy on my lips</li>
      <li>Leaves a light sheen.</li>
      <li>I did smile a lot more, though, when using it without my lips cracking. ^_^</li>
      <li>The product is smooth without being overly greasy.</li>
      <li>Lips stay smooth and moist, lasted about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>This lip butter goes on smooth, moisturizers my lips with no reaction, no rash.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>The smell is light and not over powering.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s richly emollient without being too sticky or slippery.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be brave and admit that I just hold the tin up and run the middle of it over my lips, so now there&#x27;s a sizable dip in it and lots of good balm left around the edges.</li>
      <li>This lip balm smells great and feels very silky and soothing, but I am sensitive to petroleum jelly and mineral oil and can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
      <li>This is great lip butter and if applied often, renders you some soft and very kissable lips.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m failing at my gender, but I certainly didn&#x27;t ding the product for my ineptitude.</li>
      <li>They have long made lotions and lip balms, some more popular than others.  </li>
      <li>parkil(shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulsis (sweet almond) oil, water, glycerin, glyceryl glucoside, BHT, flavor, titanium dioxide, iron oxides.  </li>
      <li>It does contain petrolatum, but it also contains castor seed oil, shea butter and sweet almond oil.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This lip balm smells great and feels very silky and soothing, but I am sensitive to petroleum jelly and mineral oil and can&#x27;t use it.  I didn&#x27;t see an ingredient list on the product page, but maybe it&#x27;s there and I missed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also includes titanium dioxide (a sun screen) and \\&quot;flavor.\\&quot;  Even if you&#x27;re not sensitive to the stuff, I don&#x27;t recommend tasting petroleum-based products.</li>
    <li> As a lip balm junkie, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of types and brands. This is one of the nicest in terms of scent and feel. It&#x27;s richly emollient without being too sticky or slippery. So it stays on your lips for a long time. And the scent is fabulous! It really does smell of vanilla and macadamia nut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally prefer a stick balm due to the convenience of not having to dip your finger into a little pot. But I won&#x27;t detract a star for that because I knew what this was before I ordered it.  And as far as lip balms in a pot go, this is a perfect consistency. Stays hard -- so it&#x27;s not messy in the pot -- yet is soft enough to glide smoothly and evenly on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not hesitate to try another Nivea lip balm like this in the future.</li>
    <li> Great smell and it does the job well. I am not fond of the application method (finger in tin, finger to mouth) because, as a teacher, I have watched too many groups of kids pass these tins around and \\&quot;dig in.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have terribly sensitive, rashy skin which includes my mouth. I routinely make my own lip balms to avoid hives. This lip butter goes on smooth, moisturizers my lips with no reaction, no rash. It is a big winner in my book. The scent (this is the vanilla/macadamia) is delightful without being cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the tin and how flat it lays in my pocket while I work. I am an instant fan and will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Contained in a little round tin, this lip balm provides long lasting moisture. The scent is mild and predominantly vanilla. It is barely noticeable which is nice. It applies smoothly and leaves a nice sheen on lips. Successful under and over lipstick, it feels nice and withstands eating and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general I prefer stick formulations. They are more hygienic and don&#x27;t entail dabbing your finger in product. I do note that this one does not leave a noticeable sticky residue. But inclusion of potentially harmful ingredients like BHT render an otherwise satisfactory product unacceptable. It is hard to fathom why a company would include BHT, which is banned in England, Australia, Romania and Sweden, in a product when organic and natural companies are able to produce similar items without toxic preservatives. So while this product performs, the use of questionable ingredients will force e to consider other options.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is really lovely; it smells more vanilla than macadamia and isn&#x27;t too sweet. It leaves a nice sheen on my lips, with no colour tint. It makes my lips soft and seems to last for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel as though this is an overly synthetic lip butter. It does contain petrolatum, but it also contains castor seed oil, shea butter and sweet almond oil. Although if you do prefer something that is more natural than this then I recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback to this product is actually the tin. It&#x27;s rather hard to open, as it is so thin, and sometimes it&#x27;s very hard to get a grasp on it.</li>
    <li> This product was nice because it did not feel real greasy on my lips-like chapstick does. Also like the nice tin that comes with it-easy to pop in my jean pockets. But my favorite part was the taste of the vanilla-which is my favorite. It lasted a long time which was nice some of these dont last that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
    <li> This Nivea Vanilla and Macadamia Kiss Lip Butter has a very nice, creamy texture and it works well to keep my lips moisturized. It&#x27;s one of those lip butters that doesn&#x27;t take very much to be effective and some seems to be absorbed while some stays on the surface to keep my lips moist for hours.  It&#x27;s one that I don&#x27;t have to reapply very often which is nice. The container is flat with a lid that comes off pretty easily, so I don&#x27;t have to struggle with it, but seems to stay on (so far) in my purse without coming off when I don&#x27;t want it to.  It&#x27;s flat shape makes it perfect for slipping into a jeans pocket or in a warm-up suit. The flavor is pleasant without being overwhelming. Another good product from Nivea!</li>
    <li> Nivea always make really great products and the lip butter work really well to my daughter&#x27;s lips moisturized and from chapping.</li>
    <li> My lips tend dry out very quickly and crack and peel frequently. I thought I&#x27;d give this product a go, mainly because of the beautiful smell. A few hours after applying this they&#x27;ve completely softened and smoothed. I hope they never discontinue this product, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I fight with dry lips year round. But not any longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea Lip Butter is an extraordinary product that leaves your lips looking moist and luscious. Even the hubby noticed the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Nivea for another product I can rely on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****DISCLOSURE: This product was provided by Amazon Vine in exchange for an independent and non-biased review.</li>
    <li> Nivea Lip butter is the latest entry from Nivea into the soft smooth skin arena.  They have long made lotions and lip balms, some more popular than others.  But this new one is a big improvement over some of the older ones.  It really does have a buttery texture and the nice little tin it comes in is easily packable in purse or pocket.  The flavor is mild and vanilla like.  Nivea makes great skin care products, and this one is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like this product. My lips were left soft, but not sticky, and the vanilla scent was pleasing, not overpowering. What I&#x27;ve never really understood is lip balm in tins and jars without an accompanying brush. I&#x27;ll be brave and admit that I just hold the tin up and run the middle of it over my lips, so now there&#x27;s a sizable dip in it and lots of good balm left around the edges. LOL! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m failing at my gender, but I certainly didn&#x27;t ding the product for my ineptitude. At least the tin is large enough - palm-sized - for me to do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the macadamia element matters to you, I would say that the scent is very, very faint, but present. Using the butter didn&#x27;t make me hungry, which I think is a good thing. I did smile a lot more, though, when using it without my lips cracking. ^_^</li>
    <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The scent gave me a headache and it smells like almonds wich I don&#x27;t like. The product is a little greasy but overall it kept my lips soft</li>
    <li> Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> Liked the scent. Product was a mess. Had to throw away.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product, but it needs to be reapplied often to have a true effect. The scent of vanilla &amp; macadamia reminded me of candy. And having that scent so close to my nose was a bit distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still prefer a better method of applying it though, like a stick or tube where my fingers wouldn&#x27;t have to be used. I wasn&#x27;t sure if there was any macadamian nut extract in the product. I didn&#x27;t see it specifically on the list of ingredients. I was curious because my daughter is highly allergic to just Macadamian nuts. Although other nuts like almond appear to be in it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have any nut allergies just to be on the safe side.</li>
    <li> This is great lip butter and if applied often, renders you some soft and very kissable lips.  I adore the smell and feel of it.  It is a warm vanilla scent that I find quite comforting.  I do believe I saw on the tin that it is made in Berlin.  I found that a bit interesting.  As for the tin, I like it and it fits nicely in my mobile make-up bag.  If you are not one to like using your finger for applications, then get a applicator to go with it.  Otherwise, I think it is very sheer and delightful to wear on my lips.  It has no color at all.</li>
    <li> I got the vanilla and macadamia kiss and gave it to my wife to try. She found the container to be the perfect size and it was easy to open even with long nails. The fragrance is light, not overpowering. Adds a nice shine to your lips without feeling heavy. Easy to take along and find in a purse. She appreciated the original scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for use any time of year.</li>
    <li> I really like to use petroleum jelly on my lips.  It keeps them soft and smooth for hours.  Carrying petroleum jelly in a convenient size is an issue.  This product makes that easy, and it has a nice smell and taste that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  The Shea butter and almond oil are nice additions.  I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s called macadamia kiss when it contains almond oil, not macadamia oil.  I&#x27;m a little wary of the additives.  One nice aspect is that it hasn&#x27;t melted in my purse like so many other products.  Of course, it isn&#x27;t really the heat of summer yet, so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see how that goes.  I also don&#x27;t understand the focus on making the lips \\&quot;kissable.\\&quot;  Their slogan is \\&quot;We make kissing better.\\&quot;  Seriously?  Oh well, I guess at my age that I&#x27;m not the target market.  Good product overall with a few caveats.</li>
    <li> As other reviews have noted, the ingredients are not ideal, especially if you are looking for an all natural product.  The smell is light and not over powering.  My sensitive skin can break out from certain lip glosses, but this one went on easily and made my lips soft without any skin reactions.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm is Aquaphor, which was recommended to me by my doctor.  However, it is fun to try other products sometimes.  Like Aquaphor, Nivea Lip Butter has a petrolatum base.  Compared to more natural alternatives, I have found petrolatum, in proper proportion, to work better without leaving a film.  This version of the lip balm has a nice flavor that is not too strong, similar to cocoa butter sticks.  It is better than those, but not quite as good as the best, at preventing lip dryness for a long time.  Overall, a good product that I will happily use to the bottom of the tin.</li>
    <li> Nivea fails on this product. The front packaging says great things like &#x27;seals in moisture&#x27; and Shea Butter and Almond oil - good ingredients, good benefits. Turn the package over and you see the first ingredient is petrolatum, which is a by-product of petroleum. Yes, the stuff that runs machines and cars. Which is a complete shame, because shea butter and almond oil are great moisturizers on their own. I suppose it&#x27;s more cost effective for them to use the inferior product though. There are also other unnecessary and unhealthy ingredients like BHT, Titanium Dioxide and Iron Oxides. For lip balm. I just don&#x27;t get it. I have a tin of 100% organic shea butter that works wonders for dry skin and lips with no chemicals or fake ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the flavor. There is a mild vanilla flavor to this, but it didn&#x27;t last long. It&#x27;s subtle, which is good, since many lip products taste ridiculously sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips did stay soft most of the day, so the product works as a moisturizer, although I much prefer using straight 100% shea butter and coconut oil for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in this when Nivea truly could have stood up for their customer&#x27;s health and avoided all the toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I just wish it came in a lipstick tube instead ofa tin.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious -- so sweet and yummy! It doesn&#x27;t taste, though, beyond a hint of vanilla. Goes on smooth and lasts for a good amount of time. It feels a little more coating than regular Chapstick, which is what I usually use. My main objection is that it&#x27;s messy to use. That aspect makes it not as appealing overall.</li>
    <li> I love Nivea Lip Butters in general because they always work so well for me. It&#x27;s feels very nourishing to my lips. It can get rid of the chapt-ness or dryness of your lips. It makes your lips so soft and it feels so good! One of the main things that I liked about this product is the SMELL! It smells so good, it smells just like vanilla!</li>
    <li> Nivea makes great moisturizing products for the skin and lips. This moisturizing lip balm in vanilla and macadamia kiss has a great scent and flavor. The only thing I do not like about this product is the top you have to pull off to open it. It is not very easy to open compared to similar products. 4/5 stars because of the annoying top.</li>
    <li> Well, here I am writing about a lip moisturizer. I can tell you that this is a really nice one. It smells wonderful for starters. Vanilla and subtle macadamia fragrances come together to create a unique scented blend that is actually quite pleasant. Lip butter is actually a pretty spot on description for this because butter is exactly what it feels like when you apply it. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s overly greasy or you should spread it on bread and make a grilled cheese with it, it simply shares the same texture. It lasts quite a while also after you put it on and keeps your lips feeling fresh and hydrated. My wife tried to steal it from me after trying it herself. I think that says quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I like the texture, scent and the way it makes my lips feel. Leaves a light sheen. Does not look or feel heavy on. Unfortunately, it is not a long lasting product, but that&#x27;s okay because you can feel and see a difference after a period of use. The little tin can is lightweight and can easily be dropped, lost or misplaced. Other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> I definitely like the Nivea Lip Butters than using Chapstick or similar products.  The Vanilla and Macadamia has a very nice scent, has a nice consistency, and makes my lips nice and moist.  It seems to be long-lasting and most definitely will be welcome during the winter when my lips tend to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several different \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; to try out and all of them sound quite appealing.  One thing that I do like, that little added incentive, is that these are now Amazon Add-Ons.  If I&#x27;m buying something else, I can simply add them to my cart without having to pay that extra postage.  Another nice Nivea product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NIVEA LIP BUTTER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AWRH8HY Nivea Lip Butter, Loose Tin, Raspberry Rose Kiss]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AWRH9L4 Nivea Lip Butter, Loose Tin, Vanilla and Macadamia Kiss]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AWRHA1S Nivea Lip Butter, Loose Tin, Caramel Cream Kiss]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AWRH90U Nivea Lip Butter, Loose Tin, Smooth Kiss]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B57QPG0 Nivea Lip Butter, Carded Tin, Raspberry Ross Kiss]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B57QSQ2 Nivea Lip Butter, Carded Tin, Vanilla and Macadamia Kiss]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B57QQVY Nivea Lip Butter, Carded Tin, Caramel Cream Kiss]]</li>
    <li> I love this lip butter. I&#x27;ve seen it every time I go to Ulta but I always skipped it because so many people were talking about a &amp;#34;pale residue&amp;#34; left on their lips after applying it. Finally I decided to just get it and as soon as I smelled it I instantly fell in love. This lip butter smells amazing. It does leave that pale look on your lips but I really don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s still a great lip butter to use at night. It also has a lot of product for a good price. All in all this is a great lip butter.</li>
    <li> Amazing! It&#x27;s huge and feels so great on the lips! Makes them so soft and smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Nivea&#x27;s lip butter is luxurious and leaves lips soft and protected. This lip product at first appears to be natural but the ingredients tell another story. When Vine offered this I didn&#x27;t check the ingredients. I don&#x27;t find this to be scented or flavored at all. It is pretty bland. Once on your lips this leaves a glossy shimmer which is pretty. I like how this lip butter feels and protects but I&#x27;m not overly enthusiastic about the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become quite fond of this lip butter. It&#x27;s a modest little thing, inexpensive, and packed in a small, round, metal tin. A little goes a long way with this semi-solid goop; a tiny amount on the tip of your finger is enough to coat your lips with a sheer, satiny layer of protection. The \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; is \\&quot;Vanilla and Macadamia\\&quot; but I find the fragrance to be stronger than the taste. If you are a fan of \\&quot;Lip Smackers\\&quot; or other strongly flavored lip glosses, you will find this product too recessive, perhaps too grown up. The important thing is that this product works. After a few days use, your lips become soft and smooth. And this is a good thing!</li>
    <li> I use lip balms a lot. I keep the tub kind in the cabinet in my headboard so I have it handy when I am in bed. I usually use Blistex DCT, but decided to give this one a try. The tin is very wide, so if you like to put your lips directly on the product, there is plenty of room.  The product is smooth without being overly greasy. The scent of it is really nice. It only has a slight taste, which is good, because too much flavor causes lip licking which wastes the balm. This was actually very soothing, and it lasted a while. There are some natural ingredients in this balm, but overall it is still a petroleum product, if you are concerned about that type of thing. I make my own natural lip products at home, but don&#x27;t really expect Nivea or other major brands to be 100% natural. I would definitely buy this if I saw it at the store.</li>
    <li> I confess that I am a lip balm addict.  :)  My lips are accustomed to always having some type of lip balm on them, and I have tried many different types.  I really like this Nivea Lip Butter.  It spreads very easily, and it is only necessary to use a very tiny amount.  It seems to last a long time, and even after if wears off my lips still feel soft.  The Vanilla and Macadamia Kiss version does not have a flavor that I can tell, but it smells wonderful.  The product leaves a subtle glossy look on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the present, Amazon does not have the ingredients in this lip butter listed.  It does contain some questionable ingredients such as BHT, so if you are interested in a natural product you might want to avoid this.  Ingredients are as follows:  petroleum, polyglyceryl-3, diisostearate, butyrospermum parkil(shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulsis (sweet almond) oil, water, glycerin, glyceryl glucoside, BHT, flavor, titanium dioxide, iron oxides.  The product is made in Belgium.</li>
    <li> I live in the high desert. The wind and altitude suck all the moisture right out of you skin. So lip balm is a must. Nivea lip butter is a nice moisturizing balm. It goes on nicely and melts in leaving a nice moisturized feeling. It also smells heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was that while it does moisturize wonderfully, it doesn&#x27;t leave any barrier. So lips feel exposed and unprotected. Nivea lip butter works well enough that I still use it. I just use it under a barrier lip balm like chapstick or at night when I am not in the elements.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nivea Lip Butter for a few weeks now and am pleased with the results. If you like lip balm in a tin rather than a tube this is a nice choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It has a nice texture and creamy feel.&lt;br /&gt;- Lips stay smooth and moist, lasted about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;- No real color just a subtle glossy look.&lt;br /&gt;- Nice scent of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;- No taste or flavor.&lt;br /&gt;- Thin shape to the tin makes it fit easily in the side pocket of my small purse and the large surface area of the tin makes it easy to use a brush or finger.&lt;br /&gt;- It has a nice consistency while in the tin, doesn&#x27;t melt or get gooey, and is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t appear to have a sunscreen. If it does have sunscreen it is not indicated on the tin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lip balms.  They&#x27;re smooth and creamy, and they moisturize really well. If you like vanilla and slightly sweet scents in your lip products, this is a great one to get!  It has a nice vanilla scent, but not overpowering, and the macadamia nut is noticeable, which I found quite impressive!  Personally though, the raspberry is my absolute favorite.  This one has a slight ivory/cream color to it.  (The regular unscented one is just plain white and the raspberry is slightly pink, though none add color to your lips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when my lips are drier than usual, this stuff does the trick.  I keep a tin of it in my makeup container, in my medicine cabinet and in my purse, so I always have some when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin that it comes in isn&#x27;t at all messy or difficult to open, but at the same time it&#x27;s secure enough that it&#x27;s never come loose in my purse, even being jostled around all the time.  It does get slightly softer when exposed to heat, but I haven&#x27;t had any of them melt or anything.  The balm has always held its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent product that I will purchase again and again!</li>
