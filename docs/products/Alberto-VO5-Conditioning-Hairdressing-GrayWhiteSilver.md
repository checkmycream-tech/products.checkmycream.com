    <li> If you have white or silver hair, there is nothing ... in my opinion ... that comes close to Alberto VO5. As we age and in some cases our hair dulls, time to brighten it up. Try Alberto VO5 and you too will be sold on this product.</li>
    <li> I am never disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I DO LIKE THIS PRODUCT I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s a reason why some products have been around a long time.....this is an excellent product, JUST DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH or your hair will look greasy; a tiny bit goes a long way, especially if you have fine hair. Would be super excellent for someone with thick, curly hair.</li>
    <li> My grandma loves this stuff &amp; she couldn&#x27;t find it in her usual stores.  I found it on Amazon &amp; ordered it for her.  She couldn&#x27;t believe how fast we got it!</li>
    <li> it is an excellent product. The hair is very shinny and stay shinny. I like this product very very much.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for many years, I have grey hair and any other hair product with even a tint of color reflects on the hair, Alberto VO5 for Gray/White of Silver hair is the only product that was on the market that kept my hair from being yellow, mousy and definately dry. It&#x27;s the perfect product. Unfortunately, Alberto-Culver no longer manufacturers this product, there is no such thing as finding anymore tubes in the store, the only place I located them was on Amazon, and once you no longer have them in stock, that&#x27;s bye, bye for me and millions of other women. The purchase from Amazon was effortless, timely and the tubes were in perfect condition upon arrival. This was my first purchase from your company, but I will be ordering more in the near future. Thanks again, Mrs. Gerie</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 25 years.  Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> My husband likes using this hairdressing.  It makes his full, sliver hair gleam.  My main objection to it is the odor.  It is a strong scent and not a pleasant one.  It would be great if they came up with an unscented formula.</li>
    <li> Works well with my gray hair.</li>
    <li> As good as always! Does help dull gray hair look better. A tiny bit is all you need for a nice non greasy effect.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of this product (Alberto VO5 hair cond./dressing) for many years. :) I just loved it. Never had a problem with this product.  The consistency, fragrance, the light feel of the cond. was perfect for my hair and applied so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recent purchase of Alberto VO5 conditioning/hairdressing for gray/white/silver blond hair was not to my expectations.  The cond. consistency was thick and heavy and didn&#x27;t make my hair shine. Even the fragrance was not quite like before.  What&#x27;s up? Did you all change the formula? Please answer honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I ordered on line was this product is hard to find in the stores and I was so excited to be able to purchase it online.  I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t order more than the three tubes.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOL&lt;br /&gt;I further research this product and found that AlbertoVO5 is made by another company. (VO5haircare.com) So their formula appears not the same as albertoVO5.com. 3/7/14</li>
    <li> Still the same product and performance going on 50 years. I still have a good mane, my bros have lost some. Not saying this product eliminates loss but...Adds body and lustre to thin, wavy hair. The blue help to minimize the natural yellowing of grey hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my dad.  He had been looking everywhere to find this specific product.  He is thrilled that I found it for him!</li>
    <li> For some reason, our local stores are neglecting to order this to restock their shelves. Their loss of business and your gain!</li>
    <li> been using this product for a while. hard to fine in my local store.&lt;br /&gt;bought the 3 pack, i think it is great.&lt;br /&gt;this is the 3rd time amazon has asked for a review.&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know what else to say but Amazon wants more words.&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, the product is nice, I would recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;I repeat, it is a nice product, I like it, I would buy again. I hope this is&lt;br /&gt;Enough words because I don’t know what else to say.</li>
    <li> Friend couldn&#x27;t find it in neighborhood stores.  Maybe discontinued.  She must love it if she asked me to find it for her.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s 86 w/ nice gray hair</li>
    <li> I HAVE GRAY HAIR SO USING VO5  FOR SILVER/ GRAY AND BLONDE HAIR  IS JUST THE PRODUCT I NEED TO KEEP MY HAIR LOOKING GREAT.!!!!!!!!</li>
