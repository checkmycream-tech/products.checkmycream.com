      <li>I&#x27;m very happy</li>
      <li>Best tooth brush ever</li>
      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Great price and a great product that I use twice a day.</li>
      <li>Great toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Absolutely a great item.  </li>
      <li>Good morning</li>
      <li>Good toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best money that I&#x27;ve spent - if I would have known how awesome this toothbrush was</li>
      <li>Loved this machine 5 years ago, got a replacement because my cat and myself knocked it over too many</li>
      <li>In this case, the power toothbrush did OK but not with outstanding results.  </li>
      <li>urge anyone who has been using one of these for more than 6 months to take the bottom of it off and check it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent item, I bought one at Oct. $121, like to buy second, but how came price go up to $181?</li>
      <li>It cleans much better than the sonicare toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I love how my teeth feel after using it.</li>
      <li>They need to come up with a better switch I guess.</li>
      <li>and I know it has helped keep my teeth healthy.  </li>
      <li>It still works without difficulty although it can now be more easily be knocked over.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Notify you that the battery of the electric brush discharge very quickly, so I would like you to help me solve this problem</li>
      <li>This model,, the 5000 Professional Series, has some nice updates from the model we still own and use.</li>
      <li>Worth more than what it is.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush began to not hold a charge after a year and to make a buzzing sound while all motion ceased.  </li>
      <li>The timer feature is easy to read and convenient because it not only serves as a timer, but as a clock - which is handy since I don&#x27;t have a clock in the bathroom anyway!  </li>
      <li>It is so powerful that it feels like you&#x27;re going to the dentist for a cleaning every time I use it!  </li>
      <li>I would have been willing to pay more.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the closest thing to dentist clean you can get.</li>
      <li>I could not get it fully clean.  </li>
      <li>This brush does a good enough job of cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I found the Braun Care 9900 Power Toothbrush to do an adequate job of tooth cleaning; however, the Smart Guide was a bit over the top to use.  </li>
      <li>Your teeth are worth it.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled that mine came with 4 different heads, my daughter that just had braces can even use it.</li>
      <li>and I really enjoy this brand new model with all the variations of treatments and battery life.</li>
      <li>First one didn&#x27;t last more than four years.  </li>
      <li>I bought this exact toothbrush from my dentist for around $60.  </li>
      <li>so people say $150 is too much for a toothbrush... because the pain at a dentist, money and time is worth it?</li>
      <li>how many other people do this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So, now I just have a small 2 inch charging ring that has no bottom which is extremely easy to check or clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned other Braun products in the past and found them to be very good.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The brush picks up some scale which is probably normal</li>
      <li>I am replacing my old one, the holder was super simple to put together, my husband did it in about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>After 3 years of use, I again needed to buy some new brush heads.  </li>
      <li>The newer ones have the smaller battery and don&#x27;t hold a charge like the first models did, but it still works for days before you have to recharge it.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>I have a 9 year old son that was not brushing correctly or for 2 minutes.  </li>
      <li>My old braun tooth brush died and I could not replace the battery.  </li>
      <li>We have had a Braun Triumph Professional electric toothbrush for some years now, and wanted to get another one.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush cleans with professional flaire.</li>
      <li>There is additional feedback for putting too much pressure on the brush, and for when to shift to the next quadrant for brushing.</li>
      <li>I just this new one because the one I&#x27;ve been using for years stopped working properly.  </li>
      <li>However now I am finding the same problem with this new one.  </li>
      <li>Its unfortunate because its such a good brush</li>
      <li>so I soak the charger in mold/mildew cleaner and do a general cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a battery which came Registered mail from Singapore only to find that the instructions for replacing the battery involved removing the bottom (using a triangular screwdriver build into the plug) which would not come out and even if I could remove the bottom it would involve unsoldering a piece and resoldering it (which is beyond my expertise and unexpected for a battery replacement).  </li>

    <li> My cleanings at the dentists office are anticlimactic. This toothbrush cleans with professional flaire.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush began to not hold a charge after a year and to make a buzzing sound while all motion ceased.  I ordered a battery which came Registered mail from Singapore only to find that the instructions for replacing the battery involved removing the bottom (using a triangular screwdriver build into the plug) which would not come out and even if I could remove the bottom it would involve unsoldering a piece and resoldering it (which is beyond my expertise and unexpected for a battery replacement).  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Received item in a timely manner from the vendor. Give ONE STAR for that. Hand-piece would not take a charge at all. Tried charger shipped with item for over 24 hours- nothing! Tried same product charger owned by my husband (so know it works on his unit) for over 24 hours- NOTHING!!! Don&#x27;t know if defective issue is manufacturers poor quality control or that Amazon re-seller had it the shelf too long. Am sending back. Will purchase at a local store to avoid getting another useless item.</li>
    <li> I was a long time without a power toothbrush and I really enjoy this brand new model with all the variations of treatments and battery life.</li>
    <li> We have had a Braun Triumph Professional electric toothbrush for some years now, and wanted to get another one. This model,, the 5000 Professional Series, has some nice updates from the model we still own and use. There is additional feedback for putting too much pressure on the brush, and for when to shift to the next quadrant for brushing.</li>
    <li> I have a 9 year old son that was not brushing correctly or for 2 minutes.  I had used a timer at home and had no luck. This tooth brush has done the trick.  He now gets 5 stars when he competes all the 4 30 minute brushing timed sections.  Your teeth are worth it.  My old braun tooth brush died and I could not replace the battery.  This one I can.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Best tooth brush ever</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. The newer ones have the smaller battery and don&#x27;t hold a charge like the first models did, but it still works for days before you have to recharge it. Good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Best tooth brush I have ever used. It&#x27;s the closest thing to dentist clean you can get. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I just this new one because the one I&#x27;ve been using for years stopped working properly.  However now I am finding the same problem with this new one.  The on/off button is not consistently working and since I just got this I am thinking of trying to send it back.  Its unfortunate because its such a good brush and I know it has helped keep my teeth healthy.  They need to come up with a better switch I guess.</li>
    <li> First one didn&#x27;t last more than four years.  Hoping this will last longer.</li>
    <li> What is the difference with ProfessionalCare Series 5000? Triumph has only 4 modes against 5 modes in 5000? And quite other base? That&#x27;s all?</li>
    <li> Good morning Mr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notify you that the battery of the electric brush discharge very quickly, so I would like you to help me solve this problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atte&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nelson Padilla</li>
    <li> It cleans the teeth well.  However it took some reading to put stuff together.  Figuring out which toothbrush to use was also a challenge.  It cleans much better than the sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent item, I bought one at Oct. $121, like to buy second, but how came price go up to $181? just bought form Walmark only $95. what&#x27;s happen Amazon price now?</li>
    <li> I found the Braun Care 9900 Power Toothbrush to do an adequate job of tooth cleaning; however, the Smart Guide was a bit over the top to use.  One only needs to run the brush over and around their teeth to find out how well the product works.  In this case, the power toothbrush did OK but not with outstanding results.  I&#x27;ve owned other Braun products in the past and found them to be very good.  This one missed the mark.</li>
    <li> This brush does a good enough job of cleaning.  After 3 years of use, I again needed to buy some new brush heads.  With the cost of the brush heads, I decided to check out other makes of brushes.  Eventually I found some replacement heads at a big discount so I took that route.  Whenever I change heads, I do a thorough cleaning of the brush and charger.  The brush picks up some scale which is probably normal so I scrape it off and wash the brush.  The charger, because it is always getting wet, picks up the beginnings of mildew so I soak the charger in mold/mildew cleaner and do a general cleaning.  I have no idea how many other people do this.&lt;br /&gt;I had some excess power cord on my sink that I though I could get rid of by sticking it inside the base of the charger.  After some trial and error I figured out how to remove the bottom of the charger base.  This is the part that holds any extra brush heads.  Wow!  What I saw was disgusting.  The inside of the base had thick mold growing all over it.  I could not get it fully clean.  Eventually, I popped out the charging part, which is just a small ring section, and threw out the rest of the base.  So, now I just have a small 2 inch charging ring that has no bottom which is extremely easy to check or clean.  It still works without difficulty although it can now be more easily be knocked over. The idea of having thick mold growing next to something I put in my mouth daily is not a pleasant one.&lt;br /&gt;I urge anyone who has been using one of these for more than 6 months to take the bottom of it off and check it.</li>
    <li> Great price and a great product that I use twice a day. I also like the remote timer so I can see my progress. The model 9000 I had previously had the timer in the handle which you did no see until you were finished.</li>
    <li> I bought thiis from my dentist for $59.00! I am replacing my old one, the holder was super simple to put together, my husband did it in about 2 minutes. I am thrilled that mine came with 4 different heads, my daughter that just had braces can even use it. I love how my teeth feel after using it.</li>
    <li> so people say $150 is too much for a toothbrush... because the pain at a dentist, money and time is worth it? Loved this machine 5 years ago, got a replacement because my cat and myself knocked it over too many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not hesitate to ever buy this electrical toothbrush... Worth more than what it is.</li>
    <li> I subsitute different brush heads and this makes the system seem as though you teeth are beinging cleaned by professionals</li>
    <li> I bought this exact toothbrush from my dentist for around $60.  It&#x27;s the best money that I&#x27;ve spent - if I would have known how awesome this toothbrush was I would have been willing to pay more.  It is so powerful that it feels like you&#x27;re going to the dentist for a cleaning every time I use it!  You do not need to apply a lot of pressure and the toothbrush does the work for you.  The timer feature is easy to read and convenient because it not only serves as a timer, but as a clock - which is handy since I don&#x27;t have a clock in the bathroom anyway!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a great item.  I went skiing with my friend who is a dentist who used one and recommended I do the same... he said that his hygenists often have no work (scaling) for patients who use this...</li>
