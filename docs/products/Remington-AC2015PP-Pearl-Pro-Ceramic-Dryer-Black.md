      <li>Nice one.</li>
      <li>The three heat and three fan settings are a nice option.</li>
      <li>It has three temperature settings, which is a nice change from the cold/hot options of many dryers, and it has a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; trigger to give you cool air on demand, which also works great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is great that it has a cool-shot button at the very top of the handle as I use this option with a large curling brush when needed.  </li>
      <li>great powerful blow dryer</li>
      <li>I is OK...</li>
      <li>Love the ability to choose level of power.  </li>
      <li>I love the heat this produces...</li>
      <li>I was so pleased that I ordered another Ac2015pp from Amazon as soon as I got off the phone w/Remington...</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>My hair looked better.  </li>
      <li>from that I really love how shiny my hair looks as a result of this dryer.</li>
      <li>it was no surprise that I like their latest hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Pleased with the performance of this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>The ionic feature reduces the amount of static electricity build-up in the hair.  </li>
      <li>It has made my hair drying experience exponentially better.  </li>
      <li>Love all the settings.  </li>
      <li>hair, always sexy, is now sexier-</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t imagine most consumers would use it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
      <li>(i.e. bottom to top should be Off-Low-High and Cold-Med-Hot).</li>
      <li>love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Probably, I find it to be better than most dryers out there.</li>
      <li>Sure, it is ionic, but honestly, it just sounds cool to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That button comes in handy when you are using it and want to turn off the heat for a moment and let it blow cool air.</li>
      <li>I do think my hair turned out looking pretty good after using this!&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The cool shot feature is nice, and so is the concentrator.</li>
      <li>the warm function is hot!</li>
      <li>Used one cheap Remington hairdryer some years ago and love it.</li>
      <li>Great drier so far.</li>
      <li>and so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
      <li>Professional grade dryer at a great price.</li>
      <li>lint filter on this Remington has a nice secure fit and a fine mesh screen and is really easy to clean</li>
      <li>Easy to hang on hook.  </li>
      <li>The dryer is balanced well, and  certainly easy to operate.</li>
      <li>, if you can deal with a heavier dryer, weighing in at about 1 1/14 lbs, and buttons that easily switch, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This thing gets an easy 5 stars for being well made.</li>
      <li>Strong when powered, but not as strong as an 1850 I used to have for some reason.  </li>
      <li>The highest setting in my opinion is extremely warm, too hot for my taste.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a hairdryer, works fine like a hairdryer would.  </li>
      <li>However, we all have fine, cornsilk-like hair so thicker hair might take longer.</li>
      <li>Works fine for my hair which is Asian/wavy.</li>
      <li>Fairly light weight and easy to use.</li>
      <li>to me is a huge plus.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that it easy to clean up the dust/residue that builds up over time at the inflow end of the unit</li>
      <li>A cheap hairdryer</li>
      <li>If it folded or was slightly smaller, it would be a great travel dryer,</li>
      <li>Cheap.  </li>
      <li>The primary reason why I&#x27;m giving this hair dryer a 5 star rating is the longevity of Remington products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Especially given the current, I think it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>I don’t often use the concentrator, but it doesn’t take up much space and it’s a nice tool to have.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far this is a great cheap gift that seems pretty reliable as it stands.</li>
      <li>&quot; Hair Dryer looks great, performs well, and in general is worth the asking price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is a little heavier than the multitude of hairdryers I&#x27;ve owned in the past but hopefully that&#x27;s just the result of a heavier motor.  I do like the way the lint filter is designed.  The lint filter on the most recent hair dryer (Revlon)  was so poorly designed; the weave of the lint screen left really large opening and a lot of lint would build up below it, on the motor housing...AND...the cap kept falling off.  Oh yes, and the nozzle of the other end also kept falling off.  I&#x27;m surprised Revlon put their name on that low-quality .&lt;br /&gt;The lint filter on this Remington has a nice secure fit and a fine mesh screen and is really easy to clean -AND- it stays on.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> My family has had many brands of hair dryers but this Remington model is one of the most solidly built and has a motor that doesn&#x27;t sound like a toy. I have to agree with others who have reviewed this item, it is slightly heavier then most hairdryers, but that&#x27;s because it of a professional motor and a warranty to match. You&#x27;ll get use to the weight and from my experience with it, you&#x27;ll have it for a long time to come. A definite buy!</li>
    <li> FAST, LIGHT AND SILENT</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great! I have used it for a few weeks now and I love it.</li>
    <li> My wife liked this. Not the best shes ever had, but a great buy. Fairly light weight and easy to use. Good control to prevent your hair from burning.</li>
    <li> Cheap.  The toggle buttons are directly where you place your hand, which causes you to change the temperature or the speed of the fan without intending to.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a steady stream of the same velocity of air.  A cheap hairdryer if you need one.  It works, its just not well engineered.</li>
    <li> A bit heavy but very powerful and long-lasting. The AC motor won&#x27;t give off sparks like my old hairdryer did. Can use it for just a cold blow dry and even adjust the heat settings. I have long hair and this works perfectly, as I use more heat at first, then less heat and more blow-drying later.</li>
    <li> I thought this blow dryer worked great. It definitely makes my hair feel soft. It has 3 heat settings and a cool blast. The coolest setting feels cooler than the cool blast and I can&#x27;t imagine someone drying their whole head with that setting, the center setting in my opinion is just right, not too hot and not too cool. The highest setting in my opinion is extremely warm, too hot for my taste.  I aimed it about 6 inches from my hand just too feel how warm it was and I felt like if I left it too long it would burn my hand. It seems powerful, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say how well it held up but I definitely would recommend it.  In all the times I dried my hair with this dryer, I have never once had it switch settings or shut off. I know others had complained about the controls being on the handle where you have to grip it and that it shuts off or changes settings. I don&#x27;t know how that could happen because you really have to do more than just grip it for the switches to actually change settings. Also it was mentioned that it is heavy.  I didn&#x27;t think it was any heavier than my other blow dryer which is a Conair.</li>
    <li> Great. Best value for the money . Would definately recommend it</li>
    <li> This is not a light dryer, yet it does a great job. It does what it is supposed to. Airflow is very powerful compared to my old dryer. I like the fact that it easy to clean up the dust/residue that builds up over time at the inflow end of the unit - the actual cover comes off relatively painless. As a note: I do not believe the weight to be a determining negative factor, as both my wife and my 7 year old daughter have no issue handling this unit. I would recommend getting a dryer such as this one for each bathroom - as a father and husband I have peace of mind that both my daughter and her mom can dry their hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> The only downside is no diffuser attachment. Otherwise the dryer is very efficient with cold air options</li>
    <li> This is a good product---no problems with it.  My demands from a hair dryer are simple, but I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> if you have relatively long hair, and want to spend money as least as possible, this is a good option for you.</li>
    <li> Dries hair quickly and seems powerful, but air pushes out from the back where the cord comes out of the hairdryer and I am not sure if that is supposed to happen.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer.  Very efficient.  Easy to hang on hook.  Lots of power.  Love the ability to choose level of power.  Would buy this again for another bathroom if I needed it.</li>
    <li> My last hair dryer was pretty awesome, so this had a lot to live up to.  Thankfully, this Remington was solid enough to score high marks in my house.  Aesthetically, this looks like a professional hair dryer with a shiny black coloring.  It has 2 speed settings and 3 heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight hair, but it isn&#x27;t immune to flyaways.  After drying with this dryer, I noticed a definite difference in the quality of the blow dry.  It may have been my imagination, but I don&#x27;t think recall seeing far as many flyaways as I usually would with my old dryer!  I had it on moderate heat, but it dried relatively quickly!  I do think my hair turned out looking pretty good after using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I found with this dryer is the placement of the buttons.  The buttons are placed in line with the blower on the hair dryer.They are also placed right in the middle of the handle (not on the top or bottom).  Unfortunately for me, that is exactly where I gravitated to hold this blow dryer.  Even my tiny sized hands accidentally hit the buttons and changed the settings once or twice.  Another minor issue is that the unit is a little heavy.  It&#x27;s not terribly heavier than what I&#x27;m used to, but different for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord isn&#x27;t retractable, but does have a fun loop on it so you can hang this up, if you&#x27;d like!  Overall, I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy this hair dryer!  Besides the poor button placement and extra weight, it has shown me great results so far!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Dries thick hair very fast without burning. Love it!</li>
    <li> This Remington \\&quot;Salon Quality\\&quot; Hair Dryer looks great, performs well, and in general is worth the asking price. There are a few exaggerated claims on the box (this dryer, while not heavy, could not really be called \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot;) but overall we were pleased with it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and there are nice touches like a rubber loop for hanging the dryer up and a built-in safety device. There are two speed settings and three heat settings, and enough safety warnings in the instruction booklet to nice and freak you out (\\&quot;If you MUST use your dryer in the bathroom...\\&quot; begins one warning.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not much else to say; the dryer smelled like burnt lettuce in the first few minutes of use but that wore off and I&#x27;m pleased with it. It comes with a \\&quot;concentrator\\&quot; for intensifying airflow which I envision losing probably sometime this week. I wouldn&#x27;t imagine most consumers would use it and it seems a superfluous touch. Of course, at our house we have only very basic hair-styling needs so take that with a grain of salt. I will update if we experience any motor problems down the road. But for now, recommended and rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: B</li>
    <li> Wish it had a heat off setting.  It has a very low setting but still has a little heat on.  I do like it and works well.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this hair dryer.  To me, it&#x27;s on the heavy side, just feels clunky when I&#x27;m using it, it also doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much &#x27;oomph&#x27; as my non-professional dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done, despite being on the heavy side!  Really doesn&#x27;t take any longer than my other, older dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other complaint, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I cannot get the flat end on the dryer, at first I was excited that it wasn&#x27;t just a slip on attachment, but I simply cannot get the threads to line up so I can screw the thing onto the dryer....like I said, could be just me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my teen daughter try it, and she had no complaints...</li>
    <li> This is a good, basic hair dryer. There are a few cons though. The buttons are right where the user’s fingers rest! I’ve turned it off and changed the settings while using it for that very reason. Then, to add to this, the hair dryer is kind of heavy. My 1980’s hair dryer is much lighter! I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, fine, straight, color-treated (2x a year) hair. I did not see any noticeable shine increase from using this dryer as some have mentioned. It does dry my hair quickly, but it doesn’t get super hot either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d say this is overpriced, especially when you factor in shipping etc.</li>
    <li> Really like this dryer and it has some nice features, but is a bit heavy to use.  Really kind of unbalanced and a bit hard to handle, especially when you have it on high.  Other than that, it is a nice hair dryer and I like the speed settings and the heat settings.  The high setting is really high and you can get your hair dried in no time!  A real blizzard or should I say Santa Ana hot winds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fairly basic hair dryer but on the heavy side which makes it a little hard to handle.</li>
    <li> This thing really does seem like it could be used in a professional setting. Maybe it&#x27;s just a smaller nozzle, but the air stream seems stronger than the other, home hair dryer we own. The heat is good and there are a couple of nice touches, like the rubber &amp;#34;bumpers&amp;#34; on either side that it rests on when you set it down, and the hook at the base of the plug to hang it on. The buttons are arranged nicely for one hand operation and the noise level is actually lower than other dryers I have used. Nice one.</li>
    <li> the warm function is hot!</li>
    <li> My previous hair dryer was a Remington and I was happy with it, so it was no surprise that I like their latest hair dryer. The old one still works fine after at least 15 years (with moderate use) and I expect the new one will outlast its three year warranty too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is a little bit bigger and heavier than what I’m used to. I tend to dry my hair for about ten minutes and my arm doesn’t usually get tired in that short of time, but if I were to do a complete drying job of twenty minutes I probably would get slightly fatigued. There are two speed and three temperature settings like I’ve had on most other dryers I’ve ever used. I like the cool setting to help set my hair at the end. The dryer is comfortable to hold and it’s easy to switch between settings with the buttons right on the handle near my fingers. I don’t often use the concentrator, but it doesn’t take up much space and it’s a nice tool to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this dryer though is the results. My hair doesn’t look like the ends are dry or frizzy like I would sometimes get between haircuts. Once dry, my hair just looks, smooth, shiny, supple and healthy. I often avoid hair dryers when not necessary because I’m afraid my hair will get damaged. With this dryer, I do not have that fear. It takes excellent care of my hair and I am glad to have it.</li>
    <li> The primary reason why I&#x27;m giving this hair dryer a 5 star rating is the longevity of Remington products. In my experience, Remingtons last forever. I got this hair dryer as a back of for my Remington Vortex which is going on being a decade old...I figured it was probably about time to have a back-up on hand since I use a hair dryer daily. I love the heat this produces...it get hot. Throw a diffuser on the end and you should be good to go if you&#x27;re looking to dry or straighten your hair. I mean a hair dryer is a hair dryer people. I tend towards Remington (also for their electric razors both male and female) because their products are cost-friendly and the hold up.</li>
    <li> I like this drier.  Yes, it is a little heavy ... but I currently own a heavy drier, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.  It dries hair smoothly and fast.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with my hair getting caught in the rear vent.  I would have liked a slightly longer cord, but again, not a big deal.</li>
    <li> This dryer provides a lot of heat and power.  My last dryer was a conair that lasted me over 15 years.  The heat and power far surpasses my old dryer.  So much so that it took some getting used to before I could use it without blowing my hair all over the place.  That&#x27;s not a complaint.  The dryer works great.  Seems to be solid construction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. It&#x27;s small but heavier than the average hairdryer of this size, and could put too much weight on those with carpal tunnel, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get the feeling that there isn&#x27;t enough airflow, despite buttons to amp up the blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air gets hot enough, and the lower temperature is a nice cool one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely noticed a difference in the silkiness of my hair after using it. It&#x27;s flatter and softer than usual, and my hair is usually very thick and doesn&#x27;t dry well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this gets a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for most aspects of it but higher points for the silkiness of my hair.</li>
    <li> Item has already stopped working properly. The heating element has already gone out</li>
    <li> got this for someone as a gift and she loves it.</li>
    <li> First one ordered worked for a day, the next day wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all then started to smoke!  I thought it was going to catch fire. Amazon was amazing in getting me a replacement which I am very impressed with. The 2nd (identical) hair dryer has been working fine. I will definitely do business this way again in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought my wife this hair dryer, and she really likes it.  Her only complaint is its weight.  She said it&#x27;s the heaviest blow dryer she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> Best deal on the market in hair dryers.  These units are well made and much quieter than the competition.  I bought one of these many years ago for about $50 and they are not less than half that price.  Over the years we have bought about 5 of these for guest rooms, gifts, etc.</li>
    <li> great powerful blow dryer</li>
    <li> Not good at all, because everyday when I turned on it&#x27;s stops and all my room electronic stop !! And not good quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavier than your typical cheap hair dryer but it comes with the territory for a quality motor. It&#x27;s also quieter than the cheap ones as it doesn&#x27;t have the high pitched whine that they have. The motor is so powerful that I only use the low speed where I used to use the high speed on my old dryer. The one flaw is the placement of the rocker switches for power and temperature. They&#x27;re in the typical place but rocker switches are more susceptible to accidental changes. I&#x27;ve learned to avoid them but you need to be conscious of them. I also think it would be more logical if they reversed the settings on each rocker (i.e. bottom to top should be Off-Low-High and Cold-Med-Hot). I always seem to turn the blower to high instead of off when I&#x27;m done due to, in my opinion, the reversed arrangement. On the plus side they seem like they&#x27;ll work longer than the slide type switches. All in all this is a quality hair dryer and if it lasts as long as it seems like it will then it will be well worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a second to have one in everyone&#x27;s bathroom.  Works great, dries thick, long hair on the kids quickly and easily.  Whats not to like?</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer!  Came new in the box. Works perfectly. The three heat and three fan settings are a nice option. Dries hair quickly and makes it shiny with no frizz. Professional grade dryer at a great price.</li>
    <li> This one lives up to the hype-- compared to my regular dryer, this will dry my hair in about 1/2 the time, which can be MOST WELCOME when you are in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other more expensive dryers this unit has the ionic feature which tends to create more shine, which everyone wants. The package is professional looking, and the all black ( piano black) unit is great for just about anyone. The dryer is balanced well, and  certainly easy to operate. Interestingly, it is NOT as loud as some dryers, and has 3 heat settings  rather than just two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That to me is a huge plus.  But.. cutting the drying/styling time in half?  That&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
    <li> Works fine for my hair which is Asian/wavy.</li>
    <li> everything about this hair dryer is good its got nice weight also has everything the high end dryers have  so i am happy</li>
    <li> Good brand, it seems to last longer that other brands.</li>
    <li> I never really believed that ionic blow dryers were any different than regular blow dryers.  I had a Revlon 1875 watt Tourmaline ionic hair dryer that was fine, but nothing different than other kinds.  When I got this Remington 1875 Pearl Pro Hair Dryer, my expectations were nil.  It was a blow dryer--nothing else.  What a surprise!  This blow dryer made my hair look silkier and smoother.  I tried it using the same shampoo, conditioner, gel, etc. that I usually do and there was a difference.  My hair looked better.  I really can&#x27;t believe it even now.  People actually noticed.  I tested it again and again against my old blow dryer, just in case I might be having a good hair day versus a bad hair day, coincidentally, when I used the Remington blow dryer.  But that wasn&#x27;t it.  This blow dryer makes a difference.  Two small drawbacks: the blow dryer is slightly heavier than my old blow dryer and it was a little difficult to take the airflow concentrator on and off.  However, it did have something, which I like, that stops the blow dryer from moving around when it is on and you lay it on its side.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> This seems like a very well-built dryer with a lot of user control. It has three temperature settings, which is a nice change from the cold/hot options of many dryers, and it has a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; trigger to give you cool air on demand, which also works great. It also has three air-speed options. The combination of these two sets of options gives you the ability to get just the temperature and air-flow you want. It feels a little heavy, so that could be an issue for some people (and this may just reflect the fact that it seems well made). The places where the cord connects to the dryer and the plug seem durable yet pliable. Nice dryer.</li>
    <li> The positive features about this hair dryer is that is dries hair nice and fast in my family. However, we all have fine, cornsilk-like hair so thicker hair might take longer. That could be a problem with this hair dryer, as it&#x27;s quite heavy. After a couple minutes it really makes our arms tired. Also, the buttons seem somewhat poorly designed. We&#x27;ve all had trouble hitting them accidentally with our fingers while trying to dry our hair. But other than that, it works nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool shot feature is nice, and so is the concentrator. The hair dryer is priced well for what it does, and it works well for our family&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is replacing my old Panasonic that I have had for almost 17 years. It weighs about the same. The cord is about 6&amp;#34; longer- which is great. It is quieter than the old Panasonic hair dryer. Also, there are 3 heat settings which is great if you have shorter hair and do not want to feel like your scalp is being scorched. It also appears to dry hair faster with less frizz.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer at a great price.  Our family has tested it, and everyone agrees - it dries fast, is comfortable to hold.  It&#x27;s substantial but not incredibly heavy, and has all the basic features (ceramic heating elements, ionic drying, multiple settings) that we take for granted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially given the current, I think it&#x27;s great.  If you&#x27;re looking for the lightest hair dryer you can get, this isn&#x27;t it, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a great, affordable dryer.</li>
    <li> I was shocked by how well this dryer worked. It gets very hot and works well for straightening my curls.  It has a concentrator which is a requirement when I buy a dryer. it has 3 heat settings, 2 speeds and a cool button. I still prefer my fave brand but will keep this as  backup. If it folded or was slightly smaller, it would be a great travel dryer,</li>
    <li> I was a little put off by the weight of this thing. I have shoulder length hair so for me it wasn&#x27;t such a big deal as my hair dried fairly quickly. However I blow dried my sisters hair and hers is halfway down her back and wow, my arm needed a break! LOL&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that I really love how shiny my hair looks as a result of this dryer. I&#x27;ve never had these kind of results before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the control buttons. They&#x27;re positioned almost exactly where your hand will be positioned so I constantly kept changing the temp and speed without meaning to.</li>
    <li> Works good.  I also would like to have slide buttons instead of toggle.  I like that there are 2 different air speeds and 3 heat settings.  I would prefer to have the ionic on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Not too loud, Ionic, 2 speed settings, 3 heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Toggle switches on handle, maybe a little too much power for stying (my longer hair gets a little tangled by it sometimes).</li>
    <li> Hair dryer works good.  It&#x27;s a hairdryer, works fine like a hairdryer would.  Not too hot but hot enough to be able to use it to style hair with a round brush.</li>
    <li> Pleased with the performance of this hair dryer.  It is great having control of power/force and heat.  The noise is low and tolerable.  The one drawback is weight.  A little heavier than I expected.  Overall I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older Remington hair dryer that died.  This has the heat but not the air pressure of the old one.</li>
    <li> I is OK...and I do like the shinny hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, like the others, that this hair-dryer really does make your hair shinny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you can deal with a heavier dryer, weighing in at about 1 1/14 lbs, and buttons that easily switch, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good hair dryer and I find myself still reaching for it.... but I have to be honest and say a few things about it.&lt;br /&gt;Often when I plug it in, it is already turned on or on settings that I do not want.  Of course, this is easy to change, and that is what I do, just change the settings back to what you like and dry-on.  I have found that although my hair is shinny, it is also more dry/damaged with daily use of this dryer.  It seems to dry a bit quicker than my other 2 hair dryers.  It has off, med and high blower setting on the bottom button and in the middle, a low, med., high, heat setting.  I do not find the weight a problem but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for the elderly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great that it has a cool-shot button at the very top of the handle as I use this option with a large curling brush when needed.  All of the other control buttons are just where you put your fingers to hold the dryer so you really have to pay attention to holding your hand still!</li>
    <li> I have longish hair so sometimes it&#x27;s necessary to use a hair dryer in this frigid weather. This Remington was quite effective in all my drying needs. It&#x27;s fast as well, which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a few concerns here. First, the dryer is a bit heavy. That wasn&#x27;t really a problem for me, but I could see how some people might not like a heavy dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the button configuration is awkward. You&#x27;ll find yourself resetting the button a few times at first. That isn&#x27;t a huge problem, but it&#x27;s worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is great for the price. It&#x27;s not expensive and it dries your hair fast. It&#x27;s not flawless, but for the price, that&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this hair dryer!  Powerful enough, a little heavy, just a little heavier than the salon style drier I had previously, so I guess I&#x27;m used to it.  But not light, and if you&#x27;re used to a lighter drier you will notice a significant difference.  Love all the settings.  Great drier so far.</li>
    <li> The dryer kept shutting off and had to be reset. I would not recommend this item. Had to unplug everything else to get it to work.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS FOR WHAT ECXELENTE WAS WAITING</li>
    <li> A little bit noisy, but it is the normal problem for the hair dryer.  Worth its price, and would be recommeded for customers to buy.</li>
    <li> This is a really good dryer for the price.  When opening the carton, I could feel the weight of it and it is substantial compared to most that cost the same.  I have thick, long hair and this offers me two different speeds as well as three different temperatures and the cold shot button.  Used it for the first time and knew right away that this is a really well made, quick drying, powerful motor.  I purchased this as a replacement for the Revlon RV544PKF 1875w tourmaline ionic ceramic blow dryer that I purchased on 5/7/14 from Amazon for a comparative price.  The Revlon sparked where the electrical cord hooks into the body of the dryer and caught my hair on fire after only 4 shorts months of use.  This dryer is definitely worth the money and has a 3 year warranty.  Would absolutely look for this brand and model again when the time comes to replace.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this blow dryer and if there is a problem the longer than normal warranty should address it.</li>
    <li> Bought this after searching for a hair dryer that didn&#x27;t set on fire! There&#x27;s a surprising amount that do apparently. I ordered this hairdryer knowing the cons (too heavy, cord not long enough) but they don&#x27;t bother me that much. It does feel a little heavy sometimes, but it works well. It dries my hair, has a cool setting which I need for my fine hair so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know a thing about hair dryers. Sure, it is ionic, but honestly, it just sounds cool to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 11 year old, on the other hand, loves it. Her previous hair dryer still left her hair looking, well, burnt. This one seems to not dry out the hair but really let the shine come through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has used it and she gives her thumbs up as well. Their hair is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her hair, always sexy, is now sexier-er.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get too hot, btw. That&#x27;s about the only thing I know about hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have said it is a bit heavier, but that feeling goes away after a few uses.</li>
    <li> love this hair dryer. works well and dries quickly. highly recomend</li>
    <li> The Remington Ac2015pp is a full sized hair dryer.  It has an 1875 watt salon motor, pearl ceramic technology and ionic conditioning.  I was deeply skeptical of the gimmicks hair dryer manufacturers use to sell their products but practical use of this dryer seems to indicate there is some truth in the claims.  First, ceramic heating elements are used because they take a very short time to heat up.  The ionic feature reduces the amount of static electricity build-up in the hair.  This equates to hair feeling smoother.  This dryer also features a “cool shot” capability which essentially turns off the heating element and allows hair to set, reduces frizz and increases shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer comes with a concentrator which concentrates the air flow.  There are three heat settings on a rocker switch and 2 speed settings, making this a versatile dryer.  The dryer is fairly substantial (some higher end models feel heavier) but it is not exactly light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this dryer exceeds my expectations.  It has some good features, dries quickly and generally does what it claims.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Very quiet - sounds like a wind tunnel more than a motor.&lt;br /&gt;+ Has ionic feature&lt;br /&gt;+ Fast drying&lt;br /&gt;+ 3 heat settings and 2 fan speeds for versatility&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Button location awkward - you keep hitting them if you&#x27;re not paying attention&lt;br /&gt;- Heavy - good and bad I guess - at least it&#x27;s solid - but your arm does get tired&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basic, but it&#x27;s very good for the price (currently $19.99).  Hard to beat that.  I&#x27;ll update with reliability notes if anything unforeseen should happen.</li>
    <li> exelente  vendedor  recomendado</li>
    <li> Been using this blowdryer for months, and it is one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> Well my mother is enjoying this very much, and it meats her standard needs as a hair dryer for need. I haven&#x27;t heard of any problems from her about it, but if I do my review will change. So far this is a great cheap gift that seems pretty reliable as it stands.</li>
    <li> Used one cheap Remington hairdryer some years ago and love it. However, after 5-some years the togged switch broke and we couldn&#x27;t find Remington hairdryer anymore in stores.  Then we tried Conair &amp; Revlon brands, none worked as well as Remington. In late 2012, we found an Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer on Amazon that comes with a generous 4-year warranty. Yes, it is heavier and expensive, but works great. So as a backup, I bought this Ac2015pp in March of 2014 which was only different in product finish and with a 3-year warranty (long enough for me).  In addition, It was much cheaper than Ac2015 Tstudio.  This one worked fine for nine month and the cold shot button stopped working after Christmas.  No problem. I called Remington after the New Year&#x27;s, and they will send out a replacement after asking a few questions.  I was so pleased that I ordered another Ac2015pp from Amazon as soon as I got off the phone w/Remington...</li>
    <li> The fan is on the heavy side and is a little uncomfortable to hold because of the buttons placement.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have 3 girls and it keeps up with all 4 of us! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace our other hair dryer that just wasn&#x27;t getting it done anymore after a few years of use and this thing works great, even dropped it once or twice and no issues</li>
    <li> I really like this hairdryer. I&#x27;ve always used more compact models, but this one is not unusually heavy and does a great job of drying my extremely thick, fairly long hair very quickly. My only complaint is that the heat button is fairly easy to bump, so I&#x27;m always accidentally turning down the heat!</li>
    <li> Wow. My hair is long and thick (past my shoulder blades) and has two-toned highlights allover.  I dread washing my hair because it takes so long to dry and then is frizzy and needs to be straightened or heat styled in some manner before I feel like I can even walk out of the house.  This blow dryer seems to mostly dry my hair in about ten minutes, and fully dried in fifteen to twenty minutes, depending on the weather.  AND...it is very silky and smooth (not 100% like a flat iron) and I can pull it back in a clip and leave, if I really don&#x27;t want to style.  That&#x27;s without me playing with a round brush or attempting to style while I dry.  It has made my hair drying experience exponentially better.  Cold shot button, three heat settings, two fan settings.  Just the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had, in my 30+ years of hair styling.  Only thing that might be a con:  It&#x27;s a little heavier than my previous couple.  But since it only takes me ten minutes to dry my hair, I don&#x27;t mind!  It feels very solid and sturdy.  I&#x27;ll update if anything changes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cold shot button&lt;br /&gt;three heat settings&lt;br /&gt;two fan settings&lt;br /&gt;attractive black styling&lt;br /&gt;loop for hanging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;A little on the heavy side, but I wouldn&#x27;t change this to make it less powerful</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer to replace my old Remington T-studio Professional Hair Dryer because this one was very similar.  The motor runs fairly quiet like my old one which is nice because I hate the dryers that have a high pitched noise. It weighs the same as my old one which since it has the AC professional motor in it it makes it a little heavy but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I had to return it though because the cord was 2 feet shorter than my old one &amp; I can&#x27;t reach the top of my head when drying it. If cord length is not an issue for you then this dryer is great! It has really strong wind power &amp; it gets hot! It will dry your hair super fast! Remington makes the other Pearl Pro dryer in grey/pink &amp; that one comes with a longer cord so I got that one instead.</li>
    <li> cord is too short, about 2 ft or so. Strong when powered, but not as strong as an 1850 I used to have for some reason.  Otherwise it&#x27;s totally fine to use and dries hair quick- good value.</li>
    <li> Nice sleek appearance, good power (1875 watt) and well made. Decent/good drying time with ionic conditioning.  I also didn&#x27;t have a problem with the toggle fixtures, though there&#x27;s only 2 or 3 settings. Cool shot and hot. Also you get the ability to clean the filter and Dryer comes with a limited three year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found it nice this product is provided with an appliance leakage circuit interrupter safety device built into the plug, in case of accidental immersion in water. Also has a test button so it&#x27;s operation can be checked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solidly good dryer. I have no complaints with this. Would I say it&#x27;s salon quality? Probably, I find it to be better than most dryers out there. Also like the design/appearance of it.</li>
    <li> I usually rate things according to it&#x27;s price / value ratio.&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer provides everything that I was looking for, a basic hairdryer with three settings and a button to turn the heat off while in use. That button comes in handy when you are using it and want to turn off the heat for a moment and let it blow cool air. I find it particularly useful for getting the whole unit cooler before turning it off.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! 10+++++++</li>
    <li> This is well built and feels like it will last.  Really dries my hair fast.  Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I have had bad luck with most of the other dryers over the years.  Found that if the Amazon reviews are numerous and high in score, the products are usually good, as is the case with this product.</li>
    <li> This thing gets an easy 5 stars for being well made. I have seen inside of it because that is what I do often times, and it does indeed have a nice robust open frame AC motor with actual spring loaded carbon brushes of the sort seen in devices like this 20-25 years ago...the ones that tended to last nearly forever. It actually runs on 120 VAC (on high) like many other appliances you have around your house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point in history the dryer makers discovered they could use a tiny 1&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34; or so permanent magnet DC motor more of the sort you&#x27;d expect to find in a toy of some sort, use the heating elements for voltage dropping resistors and run the little thing over-voltage hoping it would last at least long enough to get through the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus for this one is that you can actually see and get to the end bearings so they could be oiled eventually if needed. The other plus is that since they are not using the heating elements as voltage dropping resistors, the cool setting is exactly that...cool air. Most of the other ones with DC motors have a cool setting, but it&#x27;s really just a not so warm setting because they can not take the heating element completely out of the circuit. The slight downside is that it does make the thing weigh a bit more but it is not excessive and is well worth the trade off as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no way to verify whether the heating element is actually ceramic based but I can tell you that it is not the usual stretched coils of nichrome wire see in most of these lower cost things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A much smaller but significant detail are the little rubber-ish bumpers on the sides, placed so that if you lay the thing down on a smooth surface, it is much more likely to stay there rather than sliding off on to the floor under only the weight of the power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously doubt you would be able to find anything else close to this one in this price range.</li>
    <li> This dryer was much to heavy, and the plug took up to outlets, for someone with more then one&lt;br /&gt;outlet in the bath and can handle a heavier hair dry, fine. not for me.</li>
    <li> It stopped blowing hot air after one use....</li>
    <li> Powerful motor, all the settings I need. I use a dryer daily so have to replace usually yearly. Seems like this will last at least that long.</li>
</ol>
