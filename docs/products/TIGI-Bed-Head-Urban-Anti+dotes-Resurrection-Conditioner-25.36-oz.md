      <li>and I didn&#x27;t even want to touch it most of the time.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Blow dryer leaves my hair silky straight on its own!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The immediate feel after rubbing this conditioner in the shower was amazing: smooth, detangling, and rich.</li>
      <li>My stylist at Tony&amp;Guy told me this would be perfect for my hair (long, fine and curly).</li>
      <li>I found great offers in amazon.com with this product.</li>
      <li>My hair was damaged, sure, but the strands were still smooth and silky, albeit with split ends.</li>
      <li>It gets tangled so easy and this stuff helps prevent it</li>
      <li>The smell is almost like strong apricots</li>
      <li>The smell is strong and fruity.</li>
      <li>I got shampoo also, which was fine.</li>
      <li>but I do have fine hair and a lot of it.</li>
      <li>i am happy with this purchase and will def order again in the future.</li>
      <li>and it is so smooth</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells amazing and works very well.</li>
      <li>My hair was silky and smooth after just one use.</li>
      <li>and this is the first time since I have been an amazon member for many years, that I have recieved a faulty product.</li>
      <li>Shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel clean and well conditioned.</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>&quot; You can tell the minute you put it in your hair that it&#x27;s going to help tremendously.</li>
      <li>Luckily the scent doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair to bother me.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, it is quickly making my hair feel healthier</li>
      <li>and this is the first time I&#x27;ve allowed him to run his fingers through my hair!</li>
      <li>can definately feel a difference from the first time you try it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s well worth budgeting in to my monthly beauty budget.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had anything work better than this stuff for long hair that tangles easily.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s better than many other kinds of conditioners.</li>
      <li>Obviously one of the most important products in hair maintenance, especially for colored hair, is a nice rich daily conditioner.</li>
      <li>I do that with this conditioner and it leaves my towel dried hair smooth and very easy to brush.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>The first day I used this product, I walked into work and was literally told immediately,</li>
      <li>this stuff perks it up pretty well.</li>
      <li>But now, many strands of my hair became coarse, curly, and plasticky after repeated use of this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Usually love Bed Head products and this one is no different.</li>
      <li>It takes 3-4 washes to put the moisture back into your hair :).</li>
      <li>First of all, this is a level three damage repair product, which often means that it contains a LOT of protein.</li>
      <li>I use Terax Crema Conditioner on a daily basis and though the smell of it is revolting, it is my top choice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many different products, and my hair is still dry and tangly.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this product, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
      <li>I have only been using this for about 4 days and already I can tell a huge difference in the texture of my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since clarified my hair and started using a protein and silicone free conditioner - voila, fewer coarse strands</li>
      <li>When I recieved this product, the box it arrived in was very oily.</li>
      <li>but the product didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair..</li>
      <li>I get it much cheaper online.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have dry, brittle, frizzy, and dull-lifeless hair like me this is a savior. I have tried every conditioner and shampoo and I am in love with this set. The smell is ah-mazing kind of like a pineapple smell and it makes your hair shiny and healthy. I am so happy my hairstylist put me on with this product.</li>
    <li> I think the conditioner I was sent was maybe old. I have always used this product, but usually buy it from the salon. Decided to order from amazon to save money but this conditioner was not the usual color and smells awful. I got shampoo also, which was fine. The color and aroma was the usual. Not sure what happened to this batch of conditioner. My hair also doesn&#x27;t feel good after application.</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is a deep dark brown, but I currently have bleached platinum blonde hair. Obviously one of the most important products in hair maintenance, especially for colored hair, is a nice rich daily conditioner. After reading all the positive reviews on the Resurrection products about how smooth and silky they made processed/colored hair feel, I decided to set aside my Dumb Blonde conditioner and opt for this.&lt;br /&gt;The immediate feel after rubbing this conditioner in the shower was amazing: smooth, detangling, and rich. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when purchasing conditioner. First of all, this is a level three damage repair product, which often means that it contains a LOT of protein. We all produce natural proteins in our hair, and some hair LOVE proteins and silicones while others&#x27; hair react badly to them. My hair happened to be one of the odd ones out and reacted horribly to this conditioner after the immediate effect smoothing effects wore off. My hair was damaged, sure, but the strands were still smooth and silky, albeit with split ends. But now, many strands of my hair became coarse, curly, and plasticky after repeated use of this conditioner. I&#x27;ve learned that protein and silicone buildup from rich resurrection hair products like this can react badly with certain hair types, and the product coating buildup can prevent the hair from taking in the moisture it needs! I&#x27;ve since clarified my hair and started using a protein and silicone free conditioner - voila, fewer coarse strands everyday!&lt;br /&gt;Check the label for excessive amounts of proteins and silicones before you purchase a hair product. Maybe your hair will love the rich treatments, or maybe your hair needs simple moisture heavy products instead. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I had never tried this product before and after reading reviews decided to give it a try and i love it. it makes my hair so soft. it arrived timely and very well packaged. i am happy with this purchase and will def order again in the future. def a good price for the product as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect transactions, product as described. Received item in time expected. If I was going to order this product online again, I would have no problem ordering it from this vendor.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and the shampoo that goes with it!!! Just used it once this morning and am hooked. It made my dyed (blonde) hair so soft and smooth. I have very thick, corse, wavy/curly hair and this stuff tamed the beast!You can definately feel a difference from the first time you try it! A definate must have it your hair is similar, either dyed and/or thick and corse. It&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Both my daughters and I use it daily!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a must-buy. After several box hair dyes, my hair was extremely frizzy and full of split ends. I could barely run a comb through it.   The first day I used this product, I walked into work and was literally told immediately, \\&quot;Wow, your hair looks so shiny today!\\&quot; You can tell the minute you put it in your hair that it&#x27;s going to help tremendously. You know the conditioner that comes with box hair dyes? I always wished they put that into a bottle and sold it--- this stuff is like 50x better than any after-dye conditioner. And it smells amazing. And it&#x27;s way cheaper to buy it online. BUY THIS. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner</li>
    <li> I have literally bought and tried 8 conditioners this month trying to find one that will work with my hair. I have curly hair that has been damaged due to years in my youth of dying my brown hair red. I also found that my hair became more frizzy and thin after having my son. This conditioner is a bit expensive for my taste (I was a Suave girl most of my life) but I got sick of having to pull my hair in a pony tail everyday to hide how bad it looked. This stuff actually makes my hair shiny, bouncy, curly, and thick looking. I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s well worth budgeting in to my monthly beauty budget.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Moisture Maniac by BedHead and it was just alright...not bad...but didnt do much for my hair. I have long, thick, wavy blonde hair. I am a naturally dirty blonde so I highlight my hair to make it lighter. My hair turns to straw if I dont use a good conditioner. I needed something that would not just moisturize, but also DETANGLE my hair. Dry hair+Damage+Length&#x3D;SUPER TANGLED HAIR. This product immediately make my hair silky and untangled! I would give it five stars, but Im not crazy about the smell, its not terrible, but its not great either.</li>
    <li> More inexpensive than beauty stores!</li>
    <li> This conditioner (and shampoo!) are amazing. My hair has been through a lot of abuse over the years. I highlighted it, abused it with flat iron, dyed it back to brown, abused it with flat iron some more, and highlighted again. As you can imagine, my hair was very, very dry and I didn&#x27;t even want to touch it most of the time. Leaving it to air-dry was a no-no for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought this line. AMAZING results. I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair anymore. Blow dryer leaves my hair silky straight on its own! Half the time I would even leave my hair to air-dry, but it still feels smooth! I am surprised how little damage my hair shows compared to how much abuse I put into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week I ran out of the shampoo first, so I decided to use another shampoo with the same conditioner. The results were NOT the same! These two babies have to be used together for best results. I went to my local Marshall&#x27;s (that&#x27;s where they sell these in big bottles), and bought more - my hair is back to its softness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little note: if you are using these products for the first time, it will take a few washes before you notice the difference... but it will be there! It takes 3-4 washes to put the moisture back into your hair :).</li>
    <li> Usually love Bed Head products and this one is no different. Shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel clean and well conditioned. I have long wavy, sometimes stubborn hair, and it gets dry... this stuff perks it up pretty well. Only deep conditioning does a better job.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner of all time. It smells amazing &amp; it actually helps my dry, frizzed out, damaged hair. I color my hair at least 3 maybe 4 times a year. Not just touch ups but I literally change my whole color which is why my hair is such a hot mess but I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now &amp; my hair has never felt more healthy.</li>
    <li> A lot of the reviews discussed how great customers hair felt.  I have thick wavy hair that I hair dry and straighten regularly.  This product only somewhat left my hair soft and it doesn&#x27;t really seem to help with any damage.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft! I have used it with the corresponding Bed Head Shampoo for a month now and they have completely restored my hair from bleach damage. So happy with it :)</li>
    <li> Love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the amount I wanted but it was not one big bottle as advertised, but instead, 4 smaller ones.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about 4 days and already I can tell a huge difference in the texture of my hair (I use it every night). I will definitely order this again!!!</li>
    <li> really helps with the frizzys..smells great too!</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo and even though it is a little bit expensive I care about my hair. I found great offers in amazon.com with this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  Not too heavy and my hair has NEVER been SO SOFT!  I have very thick, curly/wavy hair that has a mind of its own.  Most shampoo/ conditioners weigh it down and feel all built up - not this stuff!  Will be buying again!  Oh - and it smells AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and cream rinse.</li>
    <li> Does great things for my hair</li>
    <li> For the first time in six years, I can wear my hair down without embarrassment. This has taken my hair from dry, brittle, frizzy, and absolutely LIFELESS to soft, silky, and smooth. I&#x27;ve been with my husband for 6 years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve allowed him to run his fingers through my hair!</li>
    <li> I usually buy this at Ulta or Target but when I found it on Amazon it made me happy. I get it much cheaper online. I love the smell and how well it does for my hair. I don&#x27;t dye my hair or anything but I do have fine hair and a lot of it. It gets tangled so easy and this stuff helps prevent it (I also use Chi Silk Infusion when I get out of the shower with this conditioner) BEST STUFF EVER!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give this one star. When I recieved this product, the box it arrived in was very oily. The bottle didn&#x27;t seem to be tampered with so I chalked it up to the box itself coming in contact with something else. The first time I opened this product it had a very strong odor of burnt rubber and a weird waft of strawberry. I had previously read reviews on it that it smelled like strawberry and assumed since it&#x27;s supposed to work magic, the odor was probably normal. No way you can have something so amazing without a little strength right?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product a total of three times and have developed small red sores around my scalp. I also purchased the shampoo, but from a different carrier. The shampoo smells amazing and works very well. I know this because I have switched conditioners to one I purchased from a salon and continue to use the shampoo and the sores had almost immediately gone away. There is no odd smell to the salon purchased conditioner either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE! I feel that this product was opened and tampered with by this seller and is not completely the original product that came in the bottle from the manufacturer.  I also brought the conditioner I purchased from this seller to the salon and all of the stylists agreed that there is definitely something funky with this particular product and smelled like chemicals had been added to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is truly amazing and I have seen a dramatic difference in the health if my hair. Do not purchase from this seller as it is an altered product and not what comes from the manufacturer. I&#x27;m sorely disappointed as the product is not a cheap purchase and this is the first time since I have been an amazon member for many years, that I have recieved a faulty product. I attempted to contact this seller several times and have yet to have recieved any sort of response.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had anything work better than this stuff for long hair that tangles easily. This works great with kids.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, platinum blonde face-framing highlights and I use heat tools on my hair almost every single day. My normally resilient hair is finally starting to acquiesce to the damage that such abuse usually brings about. The first time I used this product, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the texture of my hair. It was not until 2-3 uses that my hair became noticeably shinier and sleeker. Now, my hair shines like a mirror. So, if you&#x27;re like me and you simply can&#x27;t resist the urge to kill your hair every day, reach for this stuff. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Not only does this stuff smell outrageously delicious but it saved my hair. I bleached my naturally baby fine black hair twice in three days to tint it pink. That wreaked some major havoc on my hair. I lost about 2 inches from breakage. When it was wet, my hair would feel squishy and pull like rubber bands when I would dry it. UGH So Bad! After just two uses my hair feels like hair again. It stopped breaking and no longer feels squishy. I am so thankful that I found this product. I love it.</li>
    <li> My hair is still seriously damaged from lightening it one time. I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for a couple months and I can hardly tell that there&#x27;s any repair done. On the other hand, when I use it, I am able to brush it and my hair isn&#x27;t breaking off. So, it&#x27;s certainly better than nothing and it&#x27;s better than many other kinds of conditioners.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great size, great product.  Love it. Leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft. Tigi has awesome products and this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for damaged hair that&#x27;s really course and dry.  I purchase it regularly and really like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! My hair was dry and brittle. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for 2 months. Now my hair is much softer, shinier and healthier looking. I know it will continue to get better. I color my hair and have not noticed any fading due to shampooing. The smell is strong and fruity. I don&#x27;t care for the scent. Luckily the scent doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair to bother me.</li>
    <li> My hair was so soft when I used this.  My doctor recommended that I switch to organic products due to some allergies, but I miss the days when I used this stuff.  My hair smelled so good!</li>
    <li> If you dye your hair, process your hair then this is for you!  It leaves your hair with shine and softness.  Just need a little bit.  Takes away frizzy hair BUT doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair nor make it look greasy.  Finally, I found something that works!  My hair is slightly wavy......but lost the shine and bounce it had from years ago.  This product brings it back.  Love it.  Don&#x27;t use a lot.  Don&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> The shampoo was spilled ALL over the inside of the box from this seller. For some reason they covered and tapped the conditioner but not the shampoo. Anyhow, it is quickly making my hair feel healthier</li>
    <li> I have long thick blonde hair (not colored) that goes down to my lower back. Since it has gotten so long it has been very difficult to brush after showering even with leave in conditioners or hair serum. I do not like using regular conditioners because it tends to leave my hair oily, but since I haven&#x27;t had this long of hair in 15 years, it was time to start using a conditioner to save my hair from being pulled out every time i brush it.  My hairdresser told me to shampoo the upper half of my hair leaving the bottom shampoo-less and just conditioning the bottom to prevent my hair from becoming oily. I do that with this conditioner and it leaves my towel dried hair smooth and very easy to brush. I don&#x27;t have to put serum or leave in conditioner after using this. The smell reminds me of Starburst candy. I have tried other Bed Head shampoos and conditioners and none of them compare to the quality of this one.</li>
    <li> My stylist at Tony&amp;Guy told me this would be perfect for my hair (long, fine and curly). It&#x27;s a deep conditioner, but does NOT weigh your hair down. Plus it smells like heaven! 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I had ordered a set from a different company on Amazon. That one smelled great, this one not so much. It has a foul smell like a nail salon. But it seems to work.</li>
    <li> the bottles came in damage I am very disappointed this is a great product I would not be ordering again I wasted my money it was bad unless it is pack better than what I got it was wrap in plastic and scotch tape on top</li>
    <li> The salon recommended this to me. The price was good online but the product didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair..</li>
    <li> I use Terax Crema Conditioner on a daily basis and though the smell of it is revolting, it is my top choice. I never thought I&#x27;d find one close to it, but I have in this conditioner. The smell is almost like strong apricots and it conditions my hair so deeply. I bought the set of shampoo and conditioner (you def don&#x27;t have to use both). I henna my hair, so I don&#x27;t need the color running and this solidifies that it doesn&#x27;t, so if you have color treated hair, go for it! Also, I use a dab of this as a leave in, amazing. I braid my hair in a large braid, still damp, small dab of this and instant beachy waves the next day when you wake up.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve moved to a very dry area; lots of sun and wind. My hair has really suffered from the elements as well as the hard water we have here. I&#x27;ve tried many many different products, and my hair is still dry and tangly. Decided to give this one a try and so glad I did. My hair was silky and smooth after just one use. It continues to make my hair shiny and silky, without making it oily. It no longer tangles and the color looks amazing. I can leave it straight and it is so smooth but I can also curl it and it holds beautifully! I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but my hair looks moist and nourished; a lot of restoration in that bottle. My search has stopped here. Give it a try; you will be pleasantly surprise.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but isn&#x27;t  as good as the Bed Head&#x27;s Brunette Goddess - Will not purchase again, so I am looking for another product replacement.</li>
    <li> Love this, and it smells great. Got to me in just 2 days.</li>
