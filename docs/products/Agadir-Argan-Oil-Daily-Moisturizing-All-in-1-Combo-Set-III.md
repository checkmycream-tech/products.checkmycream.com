<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love the set and the price as well</li>
    <li> Great price. My products arrived quickly and were as described. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Like this product. It smells great &amp; does a pretty good job on my hair. Love the conditioning mask &amp; the oil but I&#x27;ve been using Derm Organic for a year now &amp; I only have to get my hair trimmed once every 6 months using Derm Organic. With Agadir I have to get my hair trimmed every 2 months. It doesn&#x27;t do that great on my hair. I have fine, long natural blonde hair.</li>
    <li> It is the best product i had tried, i highly recommend it, i can see the difference in my hair</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccanoil Extra Volume Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Liter DUO and thought I would give this a try. The product shampoo is good, but the conditioner is not. The conditioner is runny and makes my hair frizzy. The other issue is the product gave me baby scalp which created my scalp to be dry then it flaked. So my hair looked like it had its own weather system :) of snow (super gross).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each person different and might work for you. I am sensitive to other products with my skin so if you are not then should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read another review of packaging and mine came nicely packaged with no leaks. So, I think they improved packaging.</li>
    <li> Woooooooww !!!! This product is amazing . I love it .. Leave my hair so smooth and shiny love the smell .. I really recommend this product</li>
    <li> So its been almost 2 years with my natural journey and this is the first set of shampoo and conditioner that has made my hair feel really dry and brittle. I dont even care about the argument of it being sulfate free. The shampoo should make my hairs soft and moisturized when i get out the shower but it doesnt and for that i call bull and is writting this review to save anyone else with $55 thinking that maybe her hair will be different. If you have really good hair maybe you can handle that damage done.</li>
    <li> I use the Argan oil every day.  A small amount goes a long way.  My beautician introduced my to this product.  Having&lt;br /&gt;waist length hair, the ends start looking dry.  I put a nickel size puddle in the palm of my hand, run hands together, and rub it through my hair.  My hair never looks oily as the argan oil seems to be absorbed.  The Argan oil leaves a nice shine. My hair not only looks healthier but the breakage and split ends also have improved.  Highly recommended.  I didn&#x27;t really feel that the shampoo and the conditioner compared with the products that I currently use.</li>
    <li> execllent product worked very will with my hair and arrived on time .. execellnt service ..next time i&#x27;ll take more of this collection ..</li>
    <li> These products have rescued my hair. I finally dont have unbearable knots. I have bright manic panic hair and was in desperate need of help from all the bleaching and color. I 100% recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> nothing special for the price. I will not purchase this again. and the scent kinda annoys me. its just ok!</li>
    <li> My god this stuff is just amazing. I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to see any difference At the first time, but I do see it. It&#x27;s just amazing! I highly recommend it. My hair looks perfect!</li>
    <li> My stylist has noticed the positive change on my hair !!! I love the smell of this product!! It really worth it !!</li>
    <li> In the first day of use I felt the difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair after using the shampoo has become more intensive</li>
    <li> great product smell good</li>
    <li> This product does not have sulfates. It smells wonderful and I take it to the beauty shop with me. The oil daily moisturing should be used especially in the winter. A little goes along way and if it&#x27;s not working for you try something else but I am hooked. Tried alot of products before I landed this one. Make sure you are getting &amp;#34;Agadir&amp;#34; I left my perms behind and this helped with my transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more breakage and healthy hair.</li>
    <li> i love all the agadir products.. a lot of people say they are getting fakes, i have no experienced that and ive order a few times.</li>
    <li> Awesome specially the oil. Not only it gives my hair the best texture ever and it smells good God it smells good. The shampoo and conditioner it is the bomb loll going crazy for these items</li>
    <li> this stuff works great on my curly, coarse hair.  Makes is smooth and takes out the frizz.  My daughter uses it when she is straightening her hair.  Her hair comes out beautiful and shiny.</li>
    <li> I had used the hair oil and decided to give these products a try. My hair is colored, curly and course. And as I get older is getting worse! The shampoo and conditioner really help to soften my hair. I have only used the deep conditioner once so I can&#x27;t tell much difference from that yet. I think anyone who has dry, chemical treated hair should use some type of deep conditioner on occasion. I apply the oil very sparingly after shampoo to wet hair. It seems to make it dry faster! I also love the smell of all these products.</li>
    <li> As far as the way Amazon packed my shampoo and conditioner it came with leaking out the shampoo so I lost about 2 ounces the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel soft however the oil makes my hair oily and it says it doesn&#x27;t do that but it does I&#x27;ve only tried it twice now</li>
    <li> Love these products, I use the oil everyday, and I always get complimented on how healthy and pretty my hair looks.</li>
    <li> i love this set ! i really didnt use the mask but everything else was great</li>
    <li> This stuff works. My hair is fine and fuzzy in humidity. This product keeps my hair glossy and even makes my natural color appear richer.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m writing this with some pretty nice smelling shiney soft manageable hair without it being flat to my head :)....the masque is the cherry on the whole enchilada ..... my hair responded to it immediatly ..... my mom continues to use this almost 2 years aftr i first introduced it to her ...... her gray hair is like a soft halo ...... and i use the oil after shower/bath with noticeable difference in my 60 year young skin ... there&#x27;s no way you can beat the results nor the price point for ALL four items .....oh yeah did i say it smells devine :).....??????????</li>
    <li> I love this line of hair products. It is a &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; have for me. The Agadir oil works wonders on my hair.</li>
