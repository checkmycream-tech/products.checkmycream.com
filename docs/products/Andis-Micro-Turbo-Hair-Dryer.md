      <li>own hair dryers costing over 100 dollars</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is great very powerfully for its size , I noticed it at one of the hotel rooms in one of my travel trips</li>
      <li>The first day she used it, she came downstairs and said, \\&quot;Either I&#x27;m having a fabulously lucky hair day, or this hairdryer is as awesome as it&#x27;s supposed to be!\\</li>
      <li>I already own this hair dryer for a year and it is still working fine.</li>

      <li>i fell in love with it</li>

      <li>Perfect for travel or tiny spaces. :-)</li>
      <li>I am glad I did.</li>

      <li>and so far is sturdy and works beautifully.</li>
      <li>The quality seems very good, and I get the feeling that this is a product that will last.</li>
      <li>so styling is easy and the dryer is easy to handle.</li>
      <li>best little hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful little dryer...a space saver and does the job.</li>
      <li>It was light and fried my hair</li>
      <li>The only great thing about this hair dryer is the size.</li>
      <li>Specifically, I was looking to buy a gift for my young daughter of a good hair dryer that was very light, and not too hot.</li>
      <li>I called the manufacturer, returned my original dryer and was promptly sent another.</li>
      <li>Small, compact, lightweight, not too hot as some seem to be, great travel size, good quality.</li>
      <li>I bought this light weight hair dryer with the overall good reviews written.  </li>
      <li>It is light weight and has two powerful heat levels.  </li>
      <li>No doubt true at the time, but instructions now say one year and</li>
      <li>But then we went on a trip and stayed at the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, and this little beauty was in their bathrooms, and my husband and absolutely loved it!  </li>
      <li>Straightforward,  not fancy, but powerful to handle my moisture soaked hair quickly.</li>
      <li>Very hand friendly and lightweight mini hair dryer for home use and so easy to pack for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
      <li>(I think fan speed has more to do with drying time than high wattage).  </li>
      <li>I had a 1875 watt hair dryer that was fine until I installed a new light fixture in the bathroom which, when I used the hair dryer, took the load on the electrical system to the max - ooops, power is out.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve had our since 2/2011 and it has not failed us!  </li>
      <li>Light weight (very important) and terrific drying capability.  </li>
      <li>I bought this particular item after good reviews in general online about the manufacturer&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>We loved it so much I hopped on Amazon and purchased it the minute we got home, because I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price</li>
      <li>I have thin hair, and this is best for me.</li>
      <li>just right for me.  </li>
      <li>After this arrived, I have heard no more complaints, and she gladly fixes her own hair now.</li>
      <li>It made it very easy to style my hair, and without the aid of extra parts or accessories.     </li>
      <li>Thank you amazon.com reviewers for leading me to this highly effecient, light weight hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I used it, loved it, wrote down the name and found it at Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>I like this hair dryer very much.</li>
      <li>all other hair dryers, this one is actually an appropriate wattage!</li>
      <li>Bought this to replace a higher wattage hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>I first used this hair dryer in a Marriott Hotel.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through lots of different Conairs and Revlons, and they worked ok.  </li>
      <li>I first found and used this hairdryer in a hotel.  </li>
      <li>I found it at a hotel we were visiting in January and loved how it handled and dried my hair.  </li>
      <li>I loved it so much that I wrote down the name, so I could order one for myself.  </li>
      <li>The lower wattage gently wafts the heat over the glass, while the higher wattage dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly lightweight, and while there are only 2 settings, High &amp; Low (and no cool shot button), it does the job just fine.  </li>
      <li>It seemed to work nicely, but with not as much heat as my previous hair dryers.  </li>
      <li>The textured plastic surface is easy to grip and the small size makes it easy to pack for trips.  </li>
      <li>It is really convenient for taking with you on your travels, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>This dryer is compact and lightweight and works very well with just two heat settings.</li>
      <li>This lower wattage hair dryer still seems to dry hair just fine and just as fast</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it myself; but based on what she said--it is small, light, cute, not obnoxiously loud, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, and doesn&#x27;t suck her hair into the intake (like her old one did.)</li>
      <li>It is rather loud and the heat is higher than what I like to use on my hair.</li>
      <li>Nice, small compact blowdryer with alot of air flow.</li>
      <li>I usually only write reviews for items I really love, or hate lol!  </li>
      <li>So far it is working very well!</li>
      <li>I have longish thick hair and it came out smooth and frizz free too.</li>
      <li>(I have an older home with 15 amp fuses)  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love this little blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this for anyone looking for a lightweight, compact, not overly hot, or just a general travel size blow dryer.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve traveled with it for sure, but it really resides in the hairbrush basket on our bathroom counter, not tucked away, because we use it all the time, and it&#x27;s small and not intrusive.</li>
      <li>it dried my hair so fast it is very powerful</li>
      <li>I first used it at a hotel and then bought one for my personal use.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a hair dryer that has only 1200 watts as the ones with higher wattage are too hot for my short hair.  </li>
      <li>The new black finish is nice ... not shiny black but soft matte feel to it.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a replacement for my daughter&#x27;s old compact hairdryer.  </li>
      <li>We would keep tripping circuit breakers with the old hair dryer (1800W, I think) since it nearly maxed out the 15a circuit.  </li>
      <li>They are the same size but the difference is very noticeable.  </li>
      <li>It only has one setting for temp/speed- at least one more of either would be really helpful.</li>
      <li>I mean that the flow of air is concentrated and focused as opposed to diffuse, which is how many compacts and hotel models work.  </li>
      <li>It is small and light weight,</li>
      <li>Gets hair dry relatively fast.</li>
      <li>Because it takes a bit of time to style my hair with a round brush, I really wanted to just hold a lightweight dryer, but it needed to be powerful enough to dry my hair in a decent amount of time.  </li>
      <li>I also wanted a dryer that was low amperage as my old one kept blowing the circuit!</li>
      <li>My old, reliable hair blower was dying, and I looked around for something similar.  </li>
      <li>My old hair dryer finally gave out and it was also a 1200 watt</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I first found and used this hairdryer in a hotel.  I was really impressed by how powerful and effective it was. By effective I mean that the flow of air is concentrated and focused as opposed to diffuse, which is how many compacts and hotel models work.  It made it very easy to style my hair, and without the aid of extra parts or accessories.     I subsequently bought one for myself, and a second for an elderly parent who now lacks the strength to comfortably hold up the typical bigger, heavier hair dryers on the market.  We&#x27;re both very happy with this compact, easy to pack hair dryer -- a model that is excellent for home or travel use. I consider it a well made product -- it even comes with a 5 year warranty.    Hope this review was helpful.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer in April and it died on me in August.  I found it at a hotel we were visiting in January and loved how it handled and dried my hair.  So I ordered one for home.  Well, I need to write to the company now to see what they will do for me.  A hair dryer should last longer than 4 months.  Right now I&#x27;m not satisfied so if you are thinking of ordering this product, think twice.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a small, low voltage, hair dryer for some time. Went to Napa with some friends, and this hair dryer was in the Hotel. I used it, loved it, wrote down the name and found it at Amazon.com. Ordered it and it came within days. I have thin hair, and this is best for me.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer very much. Need the 1200 watts. However, it lasted 3 months and now no longer works. I was reluctant to order another one, but NEEDED a hair dryer. I called the manufacturer, returned my original dryer and was promptly sent another. So far it is working very well! Thank you Andis!</li>
    <li> This little hair dryer was just what I was looking for!  It is small and light weight, just right for me.  I also wanted a dryer that was low amperage as my old one kept blowing the circuit! All in all a great price, too.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter and it works fantastic!  Small size but gets the job done. Plenty of power and airflow. Areal winner!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a higher wattage hair dryer.  We would keep tripping circuit breakers with the old hair dryer (1800W, I think) since it nearly maxed out the 15a circuit.  This lower wattage hair dryer still seems to dry hair just fine and just as fast (I think fan speed has more to do with drying time than high wattage).  The textured plastic surface is easy to grip and the small size makes it easy to pack for trips.  Hightly recommended.</li>
    <li> Amazon sent product on time as promised. Dryer is a small, compact and powerful. The new black finish is nice ... not shiny black but soft matte feel to it. Gets hair dry relatively fast. Very good for use as a travel dryer or at home.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great very powerfully for its size , I noticed it at one of the hotel rooms in one of my travel trips and I had to have it</li>
    <li> Some reviews here refer to a 5 year warrantee. No doubt true at the time, but instructions now say one year and [...] return shipping fee.</li>
    <li> I could not find a hair dryer less than 1850 watts in any stores, so searched the net and found this one.  It&#x27;s great and doesn&#x27;t blow the fuse in my bathroom (I have an older home with 15 amp fuses)  My old hair dryer finally gave out and it was also a 1200 watt and now it seemed like no one made anything less than 1850 watts.  This is a wonderful little dryer...a space saver and does the job.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews.  This dryer is compact and lightweight and works very well with just two heat settings. I was looking for a hair dryer that has only 1200 watts as the ones with higher wattage are too hot for my short hair.  It&#x27;s hard to find one with only 1200 watts these days and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this one.  Will buy another for my travel suitcase.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my daughter&#x27;s old compact hairdryer.  I haven&#x27;t used it myself; but based on what she said--it is small, light, cute, not obnoxiously loud, doesn&#x27;t get too hot, and doesn&#x27;t suck her hair into the intake (like her old one did.) The first day she used it, she came downstairs and said, \\&quot;Either I&#x27;m having a fabulously lucky hair day, or this hairdryer is as awesome as it&#x27;s supposed to be!\\&quot;  We are pleased with the purchase and would buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  I have long hair that comes down to the middle of my back, and I style my hair almost every day with a round brush.  I&#x27;ve gone through lots of different Conairs and Revlons, and they worked ok.  But then we went on a trip and stayed at the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, and this little beauty was in their bathrooms, and my husband and absolutely loved it!  We loved it so much I hopped on Amazon and purchased it the minute we got home, because I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores.  It&#x27;s incredibly lightweight, and while there are only 2 settings, High &amp; Low (and no cool shot button), it does the job just fine.  My husband uses it daily to dry his short hair, and I use it almost daily to dry my long hair, as well as my two girls&#x27; hair.  We&#x27;ve had our since 2/2011 and it has not failed us!  Because it takes a bit of time to style my hair with a round brush, I really wanted to just hold a lightweight dryer, but it needed to be powerful enough to dry my hair in a decent amount of time.  Trust me, I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s always looking for something &amp;#34;better.&amp;#34;  But I&#x27;ve been so happy with this one I haven&#x27;t even looked for another.  I usually only write reviews for items I really love, or hate lol!  The only reason I was looking today was to see if it was still made, and I may order another one just to have.  We&#x27;ve traveled with it for sure, but it really resides in the hairbrush basket on our bathroom counter, not tucked away, because we use it all the time, and it&#x27;s small and not intrusive.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the best.  It is light weight and has two powerful heat levels.  I first used this hair dryer in a Marriott Hotel.  I loved it so much that I wrote down the name, so I could order one for myself.  So happy I did.[[ASIN:B001UE7D32 Andis 30095 Micro Turbo 1200 Watt Hair Dryer]]</li>
    <li> Small, compact, lightweight, not too hot as some seem to be, great travel size, good quality. I bought this particular item after good reviews in general online about the manufacturer&#x27;s products. Specifically, I was looking to buy a gift for my young daughter of a good hair dryer that was very light, and not too hot. Several other styles from this company were reviewed as being very hot, so that narrowed me down to this one. It is truly very lightweight, and she is very happy with the heat level. Every time she used her mother&#x27;s hair dryer, she complained it was too heavy, and way too hot for her head. After this arrived, I have heard no more complaints, and she gladly fixes her own hair now. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a lightweight, compact, not overly hot, or just a general travel size blow dryer. The quality seems very good, and I get the feeling that this is a product that will last.</li>
    <li> My husband I travel a lot.  There are times we need a blow dryer.  The dryer is small and doesn&#x27;t weigh much.  We keep it in our suitcase all the time.  Its perfect!</li>
    <li> Works great for our camping trailer. Smaller dimensions for storage.</li>
    <li> My old, reliable hair blower was dying, and I looked around for something similar.  I found the Andis, and it&#x27;s great!  Light weight (very important) and terrific drying capability.  Mater of fact, I bought it before my other one died, so it was in the ready.  Great choice for a hair blower.</li>
    <li> I have both this model and the 1600 watt hair dryer.  They are the same size but the difference is very noticeable.  go with the 1600 one.</li>
    <li> this blow dryer was in a hotel room i was staying at. i fell in love with it it dried my hair so fast it is very powerful i love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Puchased November 2010. I liked this hair dryer but it blew after 6 weeks.  However, I contacted the company and they replaced it within about a week at no cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this light weight hair dryer with the overall good reviews written.  It seemed to work nicely, but with not as much heat as my previous hair dryers.  I am very disappointed as it didn&#x27;t even last me two months of relatively light use.  I will go ahead and buy myself the larger travel style hair dryer instead.</li>
    <li> best little hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> I had a 1875 watt hair dryer that was fine until I installed a new light fixture in the bathroom which, when I used the hair dryer, took the load on the electrical system to the max - ooops, power is out.  My electrician gave me quite an education about 1875 watt hair dryers, which are cheaper to manufacture than the 1200 watt dryers.  But the 1200 watt dryers are very difficult to find in retail stores.  A ha, it&#x27;s a plot...    Thank you amazon.com reviewers for leading me to this highly effecient, light weight hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Just used this in a hotel and jumped online to order. It was light and fried my hair super quick I am so tired of heavy hair dryers, .I own hair dryers costing over 100 dollars but this one gets my vote. I have longish thick hair and it came out smooth and frizz free too.</li>
    <li> No complaints. I was looking for a travel size blow dryer that wasn&#x27;t wimpy. This blow dryer fills the bill. It is very small and compact. Perfect for travel or tiny spaces. :-)</li>
    <li> Perfect for travelling.</li>
    <li> Have owned this hairdryer for less than six months, and it has already ceased to work.  Very, very disappointed because I like the style and the size of the unit.  It just stopped working; wasted my money!</li>
    <li> I love this little blow dryer.  I use it to warm up my bed when it is cold at night.  (before I go to sleep)  I dont use it to blow dry my hair so I dont know about how it would work for that, but it works great for my purposes.</li>
    <li> Tried of losing data when your computer dies due to an overloaded circuit in a different room?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike all other hair dryers, this one is actually an appropriate wattage! Stop flipping breakers and get a hair dryer that pulls a sane quantity of amps.</li>
    <li> Nice, small compact blowdryer with alot of air flow.</li>
    <li> I recomend this Hair Dryer, It&#x27;s small and works well, the Heat settings work well for fast Drying and Styling.  It&#x27;s small enough to go with you on Trips, Or use at the house without taking up much Room.  Get one !</li>
    <li> Very hand friendly and lightweight mini hair dryer for home use and so easy to pack for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Other colors to choose would be nice.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about drying hair, but for clearing dew off the corrector plate of my Celestron CPC1100, it&#x27;s the bee&#x27;s knees. The lower wattage gently wafts the heat over the glass, while the higher wattage dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No observatory should be without one.</li>
    <li> I already own this hair dryer for a year and it is still working fine. It is small, light-weight, does not tire your hand and blows just the right amount of air. I highly recommend it. I first used it at a hotel and then bought one for my personal use. I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Straightforward,  not fancy, but powerful to handle my moisture soaked hair quickly. Worth the price and so far is sturdy and works beautifully. Lightweight so styling is easy and the dryer is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> The only great thing about this hair dryer is the size. It is really convenient for taking with you on your travels, but that&#x27;s about it. It only has one setting for temp/speed- at least one more of either would be really helpful. It is rather loud and the heat is higher than what I like to use on my hair.</li>
