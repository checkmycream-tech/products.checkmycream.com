      <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel better, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles, it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own or under make up.</li>
      <li>I got the idea from doing research on how snail cream came to be so popular.</li>
      <li>but honestly it does nothing for my skin.</li>
      <li>the texture is nice, however.</li>
      <li>However - for a first snail cream it is a great option to see if it works well with your skin and to test out the Mizon brand for a good price.</li>

      <li>Makes my skin so nice and smooth!</li>

      <li>Im very happy with my purchase and will most likely buy it again when im out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of skincare disappointments, but this was by far the worst. Within 3 days of using it, my face was entirely covered in bumps and pimples. May be it will work for you, but be cautious!</li>
    <li> Helped me a lot! My skin stayed moisturized all day! It also reduce some problems on my face!</li>
    <li> I have noticed that mlthe dark spots on my face have faded slightly. This gel cream goes on easily and feels nice. I am days use a moisturizer after this cream, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I just hoped this would make my skin look amazing. Overall not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I feel like it didn&#x27;t do much to help my skin. At first it did, but after a few weeks, I felt like it was making me have little bumps on my forehead. I really wanted this to work for me and wanted to love it, but sadly it didn&#x27;t. I gave it away to a friend hoping it&#x27;d help her more than it did me.</li>
    <li> A small amount goes a long way. If you put to much on your face will be extremely oily all day long.</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t a miracle worker like some reviews claim, but so far I am pleased with the results. It&#x27;s not so much what I can see but what I can feel. My redness does seem to have faded some as well, but the main thing is that its definitely leaving skin smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing though... although the item is listed as prime (even when I checked out, it said to orderby ____, click 2 day shipping. which i did) however it does NOT come with two day shipping. Free, yes. Arrive in 2 days like all prime products are promised...no. it took a little under 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> The snail recovery gel wasn&#x27;t what I expected it to be. It was quite thick, so I&#x27;m not sure if it is supposed to be a moisturizer or just a treatment gel. Either way, it was really thick and gooey and sticky. It was hard to layer my moisturizer on top of it. I only use it during the daytime, because I don&#x27;t want it to interfere with all my serums at night. I can&#x27;t really specifically tell how much it works, but when I use it in the morning, some of my dark marks/acne marks flake off by the end of the day. I think it is this gel that is helping it regenerate faster. I can&#x27;t exactly pinpoint how it improved my face...because I use other products. If it says anything at all, I used a whole tube up. Still debating whether or not I want to buy a new tube.</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty clear except for little spots here and there, so I was really hoping that this product would work for me after reading all the raving reviews because I was running out of my old moisturizer and wanted to try something new, but sadly after I started using this product, My skin started flaring up and I got a big huge zit right in the center of my cheek :( when that happened,  I looked at the product more closely and realized that it was also past it&#x27;s expiration date by 7 months.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to my favorite snail cream (Jaminkyung Crema Caracol) since it was Prime eligible and the other ships from Korea. It&#x27;s nice since it&#x27;s small and I can travel with it. (I do not think it&#x27;s carry-on small though) It&#x27;s a gel consistency, so for those of you who don&#x27;t like the stickiness of some of the snail creams this might be a good alternative. It was better than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried but definitely not as good as the Jaminkyung brand. It was only 74% snail mucus as opposed to 94% (that&#x27;s off the top of my head so I might be off by a few %) so that may be why I didn&#x27;t notice as dramatic of results. However - for a first snail cream it is a great option to see if it works well with your skin and to test out the Mizon brand for a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with acne for about 10 years now so you can imagine all the redness, discoloration &amp; scarring it&#x27;s left on my face...&lt;br /&gt;This stuff literally erased it all. I used it for about 2 months every night on the areas that were incredibly red. It showed really great progress, but nothing too drastic. I took a break from it for a while, but a lot of people would mention how much my skin had cleared up from it&#x27;s discoloration. I picked it up again and used generous amounts on the few areas that still were red this past week, and literally....I&#x27;m left with pretty much no more discoloration. It works slow at first, but it might be because in the beginning, I had a LOT of redness and scars. I was also very cautious with the amount I&#x27;d use on my face in the beginning because I didn&#x27;t want this to break me out possibly (it didn&#x27;t). I used a lot of product on my face this past week and it was great. I can go out without any face makeup and I haven&#x27;t been able to do that confidently in a long time. Love this, definitely a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> I have been using a lot of different Korean cosmetics over the years. This one I bought on a whim because of all the rave reviews and the price. It&#x27;s okaaay. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle skin care product - there are definitely better products out there. My skin is dry and oily at the same time - it starts out fine in the morning but gets super oily but somehow still looks dry and dehydrated as the day goes on. This didn&#x27;t do anything to keep the oiliness at bay and my makeup still slipped after a few hours. I&#x27;m thinking I need to use sebum powder to control the oil.</li>
    <li> Within a week of use, facial scars have begun to fade significantly. Also worked on a burn on my arm, so something great in this formula, ha. It&#x27;s a small bottle, but only about a dime sized amount of product is needed a day. Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Used for 2 days and started breaking out. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any differences in my skin yet - but it feels really good on your skin.  I do have some other snail cream items, from both Mizon and Secret Key - I like them all.  Skin is plumper, and looking slightly younger.  This is a rather small tube though - so I&#x27;m actually just using it as a primer before makeup.  Word to the wise - I bought mine from &#x27;another popular site&#x27; - thru a trusted seller - and paid less than $6.00 per tube.  For that price, order two at a time, minimum - as it can take a couple of weeks to make its way round the globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***edit, April 19th, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t work for me as a makeup primer - I think there is just too much dimethicone for my face to handle.  The moment I sweat the tiniest bit, everything slides and looks yucky.  But, I do still think it feels good on my face - I use it when I stay home for the day, no makeup needed.  I sometimes mix it with a light moisturizer, or I use it in place of a moisturizer.  I did try mixing it with some bb creams that I found too drying, but it didn&#x27;t do well.  I will use what I have on hand, but won&#x27;t reorder - at least not until my face becomes less oily and or I stop sweating - it does seem to be better for me in the winter time, when the air is more dry.  Still a great product though, just not for me at the moment.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about trying this product, but honestly saw no results whatsoever. I&#x27;m sticking to vitamin C and that&#x27;s it. It can work for you if you want light moisture. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for about 1 week and I can tell a difference in my skin already, I had tiny dry patches around the hairline damaged from 43 years in the sun, and this gel has softened them up and they are almost gone. My skin around the eyes are much tighter and my face has a much smoother appearance! I will use this forever:)</li>
    <li> Omg I loved this skin cream! It really did repair! My skin is super dry and sensitive. It helped get rid of all the dry patches on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately my dog got a hold of it and chewed it up. I need to order a new one!</li>
    <li> Hydrating, repairing, light, not greasy at all, great under makeup as a primer</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Mine came in a brown tube instead of a pink one and when I contacted the seller, they informed me that mizon had changed their packaging to match the rest of their line. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true or not but nonetheless this product worked for me. It made my skin healthier looking and moisturized it. It wasn&#x27;t too greasy for my oily combo skin. I used up all of this product and will probably repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing! I will be purchasing many many more!</li>
    <li> MAKES MY  FACE FEEL AMAZING</li>
    <li> Must buy, Extremely useful if you have blemishes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read amazing reviews about this but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference after many weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, and I think actually made me break out. Many people love this-- for me it was just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. Will be trying other snail products instead.</li>
    <li> My skin is a lot clearer after I have used this! I use it twice a day but I may cut down to once a day at nighttime and see if I get the same results!</li>
    <li> great product for oily skin type</li>
    <li> I am satisfied. The item arrived 2 weeks earlier than the given time frame. Fast transaction and nice product.</li>
    <li> This is too watery and running for my liking.  Feel like it did not do anything to my skin.</li>
    <li> i decided to try this miraculous recovery gel after reading a thread on /r/asianbeauty. the user commented that this stuff was great to apply on freshly popped pimples (i know, so bad for your face) and that it helped with the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as another amazon user commented, this is not your traditional face lotion. like the name says, it&#x27;s a light gel that absorbs into your skin quickly. i always use this right after i shower for about two months now and i&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. i had a lot of hormonal acne that left scars (because i picked at them, d&#x27;oh) and those scars are significantly less noticeable. i&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s because i started using this stuff or my hormones have finally calmed down but i&#x27;ll take any improvements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have dry skin, you&#x27;ll probably want to put on your regular moisturizer and this gel over it. i&#x27;ve also had good experiences with using the gel almost as a make-up primer using the previously mentioned method. however, some people have said that this caused them to break out. if you know you have a lot of allergies or sensitive skin, i would do a patch test first. this wasn&#x27;t the case for me but better safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been telling all my friends to start using snail goo on their faces! couldn&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
    <li> Love this! Sinks in easily, moisturizes fully. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I love this so much and am about to order more. This stuff is my go to, necessary item in my routine. It really helps with redness and the occasional  pimple. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many months. It goes on smoothly and absorbs into my skin immediately. My skin looks 10 times better than before. I recommend this to everyone. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Tried this on a whim not expecting much.  Wow, I really notice a difference.  My pores do look smaller and my skin glows more.  Hard to explain, but I will say that I am very happy with this product and will buy again.  Its&#x27; part of my daily routine now.  I wear moisturizer over it, but as a base, this is excellent as is the price.</li>
    <li> Sticky, but really comfy!</li>
    <li> I just received this a couple days ago. The product did not have a certified mizon sticker to prove that it is a real mizon product. The layout of the words on the back of the package is also different from the original mizon picture. I tried using the product on one side of my face to see the difference between two sides of my faces, but unfortunately, it actually broke me out on the side I used it on. This is the worst. Can&#x27;t believe I spent my money on something so useless. I&#x27;m going to try to contact the seller and see what I can do :( so disappointed</li>
    <li> I got asked the other day if I had been tanning, because they said my skin ws glowing. I dont go out in the sun, but I have noticed a change too. I put this gel on after I get out of the shower and before bed each night. I have seen less acne, less oil, and smaller pores. For $10 I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> The gel like formula absorbs quickly. I tend to have very oily skin but this product does not feel oily or make my skin shine.</li>
    <li> This makes a great middle step for my skincare routine- I use it after my serum and before my heavier overnight moisturizer.  It&#x27;s also wonderful for daytime use on its own (under sunscreen, of course), especially in summertime when my skin doesn&#x27;t need a heavy moisturizer.  I have sensitive skin and have not experienced any irritation or breakouts from this product.  It&#x27;s a little sticky at first, but you can&#x27;t feel it at all after you give it time to sink in.</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple of months now. And there is now words to describe how much I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Facts about my skin: Olive tan, normal to combination skin towards the oily side. Suffer years of cystic acne, pimples and scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use this with micro needling. But I end up doing it a couple of times only. Despite that, my mini icepick scar heals and fill in and I must say this cream gel might be one of the reason why my skin collagen rebuilt so fast. I keep on using it at night and morning  at first but now Im only using at night because I wanted to used a whitening product in the morning. The price is not bad and it does helps with your skin recovery what ever state it might be. It glides on smooth and absorbs into the skin fast. I even used this stuff on cuts and it helps to heal that too!! I know its hard to find lighting or healing product for your skin scarring especially people who are tan but this its job gently even for my slightly sensitive skin. And people might react differently n be especially put off with the words snail too, but it does not feels gross at all I swear. Give it a try, it might works for you like it did me! :)</li>
    <li> I am exceptionally pale and my face is constantly red and dry, especially when it&#x27;s cold. This cream, within 5 minutes of putting it on, got rid of 90% of the redness and patchiness from the dry winter air. Seriously HG worthy. Buy it if you have sensitive, dry skin. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Read about this in a New York Times article on Korea and I love the way this makes my skin feel.  Who knew snail slime was so rejuvenating?  I am older and my skin was dry and thickened- now far more supple.</li>
    <li> So far its giving me an even tone, but keep in mind this is a gel and something likely needs to go over it (cream).  Would I buy it again? I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle and see, ill likely try a different snail cream line though.</li>
    <li> Yes, had to try it out of pure curiosity! But I really do love it! A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a week now and can already feel and see a difference. Pores are smaller and my skin feels baby soft. The part about healing is so true! Had a bad reaction to laser hair removal on my face - got burned pretty bad. Put this on religiously morning and night for four days and the burns were gone!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely keep using this! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin.</li>
    <li> I *JUST* received this product through the mail while at work. The poor mail lady must have thought I was crazy. I smashed open the box right away and started going through my beauty haul that I have (im)patiently been waiting for. Since I anticipated this product arriving today I was certain to wash my face really well prior to going to work. I added a light moisturizer  so that I could apply this to my face right way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product. I read every review--good, bad, and ugly to prepare myself. I opened the product and applied a pearl sized bead to my skin and then began to lightly dab it around my face. I waited a few minutes and then did a double take in the mirror. My skin looks like it would look after I add foundation and powder at the present moment. Hold on, let me look again because I certainly don&#x27;t think this is happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...5 minutes later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked into my boss&#x27; office, and she looked up from her desk and asked me what I did to my skin. She said it looked flawless. F-L-A-W-L-E-S-S. Telling me this while I know my flaws was a serious ego boost. So much, so that I am contemplating ordering more of this once it becomes available again. I felt a little bit weird about putting snail slime on my face, but the slime is filtered if that thought helps ease your mind and make your purchasing decision easier.</li>
    <li> Awesome gel moisturizer. Great for summer months when you don&#x27;t need something super thick. Great for people who have oily skin. Second time repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it has become a cult favorite with the (Asian) skincare community. Snail slime is all the rage these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving it, the tube appeared a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but that’s okay. I will most definitely repurchase and I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one thing that a lot of people haven’t mentioned is the smell of the product. Yes, the gel doesn’t have a fragrance, but to me, it smells slightly like…snail? Maybe that’s just how my brain works. It probably doesn’t help that the consistency is a bit sticky as well. Anyway, smell or no smell, this gel is now a holy grail product for me, and I&#x27;m putting in another order before my tube runs out (I usually order from Asian beauty sites and they can take a month to get here in the US).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this gel has been really good with reducing pigmentation and brightening my skin overall. My skin also feels less oily. I use it every morning and night before putting on my moisturizer. I was nervous about using it because of all the hype, but it&#x27;s been wonderful for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PSA: This tube is only about $5 on other trustworthy Asian-branded sites.</li>
    <li> So far I really enjoy this gel/cream. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin to break out. Love the consistency, absorbs well.  Lightweight. I use it AM/PM. Good on it&#x27;s own or under make up.</li>
    <li> This gel when used with the whole line works well for me. I have dry skin with few breakouts  around chin. There&#x27;s not a miracle cream out there that will live up to its claim however this Mizon snail repair line seems to make a difference with fading lines and discoloration. I have used the line consistently for a few months now twice a day and I have noticed improvement</li>
    <li> The snail cream has kept my face adequately moisturized and smooth (no reactions or acne yet) during the dryness of winter in the east coast. I only wash my face at night during the winter. I use a bb cream in the morning. It may not be moisturizing enough for drier skin. I have combination skin with patches of dry spots. I have been using this for 2-3 weeks and am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> That was the exact item that I ordered. I was totally satisfied with this item. Thank you so much!! Excellent for using privately.</li>
    <li> It broke me out. Red little bumps everywhere. Not irritated, no whiteheads, just..bumps? My skin doesn&#x27;t like it. It does its job in terms of moisturizing but the trade off isn&#x27;t worth it. Sorry snail goo, I wanted to love you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say this is one of my best online purchase. It&#x27;s not pricy at all but does the job. Some small pimples on my face went away after a few days, though the bigger ones are not healed yet. I&#x27;m not sure if it does shrink my pores or just fill them up. I do see smaller pores when I&#x27;m using this gel. It also reduces the redness on my face. I have combination to oily skin, this gel doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily at all. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best moisturizer since I do need more hydration in the air conditioned room.  I&#x27;d like to repurchase after I&#x27;m done with this tube.</li>
    <li> I love the cooling sensation I get from applying this moisturizer. I use it in the evening and it&#x27;s perfect for summer. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone, but snail goo seems to keep it happy.</li>
    <li> This is a great light moisturizer! Snails have got to be one of the greatest skincare additives and this product is no exception. I love using this even on bug bites as I find it greatly reduces the irritation and itching!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m almost 53 and look about 10 years younger due to this and other breakthrough products. The Koreans are years ahead of us in skincare products and this is an amazing way to bring balance to a really pissed off case of rosacea. The redness backs off, your skin is supple and smooth and almost chilly, it&#x27;s that good. When applying makeup over it, it stays and your makeup does not slide off as is typical with those of us that have this ailment. I use it, so does my daughter. Her struggle is with excess sebum, rosacea and enlarged pores. Both of us are very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I thought it would be interesting to try a cream made from snail. it felt like more like applying serum than cream. Would I buy it again? No.  It is not bad but not something Id would buy again. It is not gross or anything like that. The cream felt nice and light with a little fragrance. That&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
    <li> I got it because some YouTube beauty guru swore by it but honestly it does nothing for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t smell good, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel better, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles, it doesn&#x27;t do anything. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Plus, it&#x27;s full of air so they are totally scamming your money for only a little bit of product. I think this company is a scam.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is moisturizing, but it does absorb into the skin after about 10 minutes. Then again, I have oily skin so that may be why. I use this moistly as a sleeping pack just before aquaphor. I think it&#x27;s light enough for summer if you have dry/combo skin, but not so much for oily. Would repurchase once it&#x27;s cooler outside again.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of snail cream, because so many korean products use it now, and it has so many benefits to it, I just wish that I had a better experience with this cream. This product lasts for a year (it says so on the back) and would probably be used up by that time. It does not have an offensive or strong smell whatsoever and is a milky translucent in color. The tube is slightly smaller than what I expected, but is still an alright size for the price, and the packaging is pretty basic. This product would probably be better for someone with normal to dry skin, as it leaves more moisture than I (combination-oily skin) would need. I don&#x27;t really like how this product feels on my skin, it sinks in well, but it makes your face tacky. I will use it up, but if you have the same skin I do, I recommend using this at night. When I apply it, at first it is a gel, but as you rub it in, it slowly becomes more watery (in texture) and thin. Even though it leaves a slight tackiness to the skin, if you press your fingers against it, it will not leave your fingers tacky. I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long, but I have noticed that after I apply it, it has a blurring affect on the skin, making it look slightly better than before use.</li>
    <li> The product came just on time as estimated. The package was in good condition and i even got a free sample of Secret Key Snail Repair Cream^~^ The tube was a lot smaller than i expected but its ok. The product was indeed gel like and it wasnt gross or anything at all. It had no scent and it easily absorbed into my skin. The next morning, my skin was very soft and my pimples were already healing! Im very happy with this purchase and i hope i will get better results with continuous use. Ill update again after using it for a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: this has not given me a break out at all so thats a relief:) No lie, this is my new holy grail skin care product! I feel like it doesnt do much for pimples that are just forming, but when i have a huge ugly pimple thats at the peak of its horrible pussy glory using this will heal it in 1-2 days! Usually it takes about a week for it to completely disappear but this had cut the healing time down by a lot! Im very happy with my purchase and will most likely buy it again when im out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this gel-cream!! It&#x27;s so smoothing on my skin and not &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; at all (yes, snail secretion is there. no, it doesn&#x27;t feel like rubbing a snail on your face.). I love using it as a moisturizer as it&#x27;s light but effective, and absorbs into my skin, making it nice and super soft for the day. I highly recommend! The size shouldn&#x27;t be a deterrent even though it&#x27;s 45 ml; a little little bit goes a long way! It&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have definitely seen a difference in my skin! It&#x27;s smoother and more toned out. This product dries fast so you need to really work it into your skin fast. It leaves my skin feeling super smooth without feeling greasy. It almost feels like you didn&#x27;t put any product on!</li>
    <li> It feels nice, smell is kinda weird but minimal. Overall, feels great, but I&#x27;m just not sure it did anything to my face.</li>
    <li> I have gone through several tubes of this snail gel and while I loved it at first, I now realize it may not be the most suitable for my skin. I have combination skin with acne and I started to use this in hopes that I could perhaps speed up the healing of my skin and fade acne scars. I religiously used this for a while hoping for results and after applying it my face was always a little red. I attributed this to perhaps the friction of rubbing it in, but while waiting for a new tube to arrive I used a different lotion without any resulting redness. I realized that there is something about the product that reacts negatively to my skin, as I have extremely sensitive skin. It did not break me out as I know of but the redness was something to be wary of. Otherwise, I would have continued use of this as it moisturizes nicely and seeps into skin without feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> Absorbs perfectly into skin and even reduces oiliness and dryness.</li>
    <li> i really dont know what to say about this product, at first i thougt it cause me some little rush on my cheeks, but then i started using a toner, and worked better?? now i use it alone and sometimes with the toner, my skin its soft but different. my pores are a little bit bigger then before, but it doesnt bother me a lot..</li>
    <li> For me, it works GREAT! A little goes a long way. Have been using it for over a week and it has helped with my acne and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it works better with the argan oil I&#x27;ve been using for almost a month. The argan oil hasn&#x27;t done too much for my acne but it has helped with my dry skin as well. Both make an effective combo! :D</li>
    <li> It definitely is what is it. After a week or so of using it, it has left its mark in the best kind of way. I feel that my skin is a lot clearer, soft, and moisturized. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> This was my first foray into AB skincare. This cream saved my life and my face. I had a horrible break out that was mediated by this wonderful magic in a tube. It glides on your skins and transforms it into something soft and lush. It moisturizer, repairs, and brightens your complexion. I will never not have a tube of this at home. I have recommended it to countless friends and family. Buy it and be prepared to have your mind blown! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not slimey like you&#x27;d expect it to be.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s not a conventional use for snail cream but it really works. I used it to heal a piercing in my lip that tore and in 24 hours the swelling and pain were gone. I got the idea from doing research on how snail cream came to be so popular. It&#x27;s also very good for cystic acne. I broke out real bad a few weeks ago and used some of this on the pimples and they were gone in two days. Good stuff. This is the second tube I&#x27;ve bought. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this because it got good reviews but it made me breakout....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about a week. I&#x27;m 31 and I deal with wrinkle lines and acne. I&#x27;ve been wearing this night and day and I have actually (or should I say, surprisingly...I&#x27;ve tried SO many things) seen some improvement in skin tone and face brightness, as well as red mark reduction. Will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> Fast service and an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I like the snail recovery gel cream.  It can be sticky during a hot summer month but fall is perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t give me any different on my skin so far.  It&#x27;s ok for a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING ! VERY SOFT! I USE THIS CREAM AS A NIGHT CREAM FOR MY BLEMISHING AND SCARS.</li>
    <li> This product is a fairly solid product. I use it as my very last step in my night routine after my hyaluronic acid moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin or troubled spots with this product, however it does do a great job of keeping my skin moisturized at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product until it is gone, however I am not sure if I will repurchase or not.</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail not so long ago, so I&#x27;ve only used it for two nights (with Pond&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream over it). Since it&#x27;s only been two nights, I won&#x27;t make a thorough review, but I most definitely will come back to this later to give an update. So far though, all I can say is that it goes on smoothly and absorbs well; but like someone else mentioned, you need a cream or a moisturizer to go over it, because this isn&#x27;t meant for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I bought this was to clear up my complexion/tone. I have red skin - not in the acne way, as I have been very lucky to never have to fight that battle, but I just have a ruddy appearance, which is something I&#x27;m embarrassed about. So after I&#x27;ve been using this for a while, I&#x27;ll come back to share the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;m going to say that this product definitely works for me, but I&#x27;m going to need to use it twice a day instead of once a day. The redness on my face partially went away (yay!)and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my pores! So I&#x27;ll be using this Snail Recovery Gel for a while; I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is great! I added this to my routine under my moisturizer. It is a welcome addition. People have been raving about this stuff and I see why. I&#x27;ve seen an over all brightening and more of an even tone in my skin. I honestly saw results in a few days. I used to feel like I had to wear foundation all the time. Now most days I do not. It&#x27;s wonderful to have make up optional skin.</li>
    <li> Instantly noticed It helps fade the appearance of lines in two uses overnight.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell much about this product yet because i just tried it only 2 days since  brought this, and im hoping that it will works well to me.. my issue is the prioce coz i was shecking this item on other site and price only 6usd..</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff! It makes the perfect lightweight essence.</li>
    <li> Got here quickly. Just not so into the consistency of the product. Doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly and leaves a sticky finish.</li>
    <li> Made my pores look larger</li>
    <li> I am in love with snail.goo. I read all the reviews and had to.try this. Omg my skin is tighter firm and gives my skin a glow!!&#x27;I.did read the reviews about this being fske . Its not thankfully they changed the box. It has been about 2 weeks and I see differences in my skin. Its brighter tighter more firm. This is a great addition to my skin care routine!! I can&#x27;t believe I love snail goo but I do!! It works so.well. I love Mizon products. Mizon has a great reputation for skin care products. I have a 90 percent collagen product from.Mizon and Wow great results when these two are used together.They have a lemon scrub I want to use now. Mizon is a Korean skin care favorite now I know why</li>
    <li> Make my skin so soft and hydrated. i wear it day and night! I also heard a lot about how it can fade acne scars and pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I love snail goo, but I notice some misconceptions in the negative reviews about what it does. I&#x27;ve used the Multipurpose Snail Cream(brown jar) and the Snail Recovery Gel Cream(pink tube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*THESE ARE NOT MOISTURIZERS.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cream is not synonymous with moisturizer in Asian culture like it is in the USA. If anything, I would categorize this as a healing salve to help problematic skin issues. For me, it helps to minimize redness that has begun to appear as I&#x27;ve aged, and heal blemish spots. You will still need a good moisturizer to apply after one of these creams.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for years and even went as far as getting medication for it in the past. I still have pimple problems and I&#x27;ve had some troubled areas on my face that seem to never go away. After using this product, my results were instant and my face is mostly clear now! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing snails! Feels very clean, absorbs well. Does seem to be helping my old acne spots that seem to take forever to fade.</li>
    <li> Got this from Package_go_fast seller. Even though it was supposed to take a month to be received, I got it in two weeks. Wish there was a bigger size of this. Didn&#x27;t realize it was so small until I received it. This gel gets used up really quickly but then again I did not use it with any other snail product from the mizon snail line. First few days of use I noticed that there were tiny white heads but those cleared up within the next day or two as I continued using the gel. My old blemishes seemed to heal faster with this gel. I don&#x27;t think I can do much about my hormonal acne but this product does help the acne to heal or diminish the scars faster. I have been using it for a month. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am a 19yr old Japanese girl with oily/combination skin that has struggled with acne for YEARS. Nothing ever worked. Trust me when I say this because I have tried many different things like different face washes, products, acne facials, and laser treatment throughout my teenage years. I had just accepted the fact that I was going to have to grow out of my oily skin with age. This is why I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product when I clicked on it. However, I looked at the reviews and someone with skin like me said that this was the first product that worked for her, and it worked really well. I saw the price and decided it wasn&#x27;t too bad and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also read that it wasn&#x27;t a moisturizer so I paired it with a toner and used it all over my face every morning. Sadly, I saw no results but kept trying. After several days, I looked up to see if I was using it wrong somehow. I read in a review blog to use it at night as a spot treatment. I put it on after my toner and lotion and saw results the very next day after the first try. I think I&#x27;ve used it 4 or 5 nights in a row now and my skin has not looked this clear in a very long time. I will definitely keep using this. My one complaint is the price. I saw in multiple reviews that it cost around $4 for them! But, if I can&#x27;t find it for that much anywhere else, I am definitely willing to pay this much again.</li>
    <li> After I used this some pimples popped out. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t suit me but anyway at first before the pimples it is quite good.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the idea of snail secretion deter you, this stuff is awesome! It&#x27;s perfect alone (it&#x27;s very moisturizing) or under moisturizer and sits great under makeup. I recommend this to everyone that asks! It&#x27;s truly phenomenal</li>
    <li> Pretty weird knowing your putting snail slime on your face, but if your concerned look it up online. Research proves a significant help in anti aging, I have personally used it to help lighten up my acne scars....it works well but only when there are no active breakouts</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t any drastic changes in my skin but it&#x27;s fairly manageable. It&#x27;s better to put on at night and the product dissolves into your skin. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> wow &amp;#60;3 this has helped me so much already</li>
    <li> nothing happened... like the product but no great result</li>
    <li> I thought it was weird to have snail secretion all over my face but from what I read on the reviews I decided to give it a shot. This stuff is magic! I usually use this at night after I wash my face and the next morning it leaves my face feeling so soft!  It also helped clear up the redness on my face</li>
    <li> Love it! All it took a couple of days to notice my pores a lot smaller and brighter face. I put it on at night and my regular moisturizer during the day because I do feel my face a little dry after wash it off.</li>
    <li> This is actually really awesome! When I bought it I was just wanting to try something new and was a bit skeptical about its effectiveness. Also a bit uncomfortable with the idea of wiping snail goo on my face. I was impressed after a few uses at the way it makes me skin look and feel. It was able to help clear up an acne flare up, makes my skin feel tighter and more smooth, shrinks pores, and makes my skin just look all around healthier and more youthful. It is the thing I needed that I didn&#x27;t know I needed and now I use it every day and love it!</li>
    <li> This is the first product for which I felt compelled enough to write an Amazon review for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a whim after seeing it on Buzzfeed&#x27;s list of &amp;#34;Asian cult beauty products&amp;#34;, thinking that at least it would make for a funny/disgusting conversation piece, and I am so glad that I did.  Some stats on me: late 20s, Asian, oily/combination skin, still breaking out like a teenager, have tried all brands high and low looking for salvation.  Who knew that the answer to that was snail slime from Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 1 week of using this on my face day and night, my face has cleared significantly.  In fact, this is probably the clearest, most blemish-free skin that I&#x27;ve had in probably 3 years.  My pores are smaller.  I&#x27;m not so shiny any more.  The effect was immediate and it&#x27;s even fading some of my scars from previous breakouts.  Makeup goes on easily and stays, and my face is less greasy through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to hoard a few more tubes of this stuff but since it looks like there&#x27;s ample distribution, I&#x27;ll buy fresher bottles as needed.  Cannot recommend this more.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gel cream thinking it&#x27;d penetrate my skin and will leave it pretty soft after using it. Truth is this product is quite light, if your skin is dry, you&#x27;ll have to apply quite a bit of it.&lt;br /&gt;This product clearly is not a moisturizer, it&#x27;s good if you want to wear before applying any makeup foundation, because it&#x27;s light and thin.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it, unfortunately is something that doesn&#x27;t quite go with my face/ skin type.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you have oily/mixed skin type. It&#x27;s light, refreshing and so far away from being greasy.</li>
    <li> I added it to my skincare routine and I have a suspition that it caused a light breakout. I like the texture though - it&#x27;s a light gel, your skin &amp;#34;drinks it up&amp;#34; quickly as soon as you put it on, and feels and looks better. But there are some products in US organic cosmetics brands that feel much better on my skin, having the same light gel consistency and feel. I guess these snails are either hit ot miss...</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. This has helped heal a lot of my acne and uneven skin issues. While not a moisturizer alone, it does keep my skin well hydrated and looking great.</li>
    <li> Just started using this, but so far I love it. I have noticed subtle changes in my skin complexion. Will continue to use it for maximum results.</li>
    <li> strangely leaves skin with worse scarring, not sure why. the texture is nice, however.</li>
    <li> I received the item yesterday and I&#x27;ve used it a total of three times. The product is unscented and absorbed into my skill very quickly. Seems like it&#x27;s working pretty well so far and is keeping my skin hydrated.  One concern I had was that the box came with no holographic Mizon authenticity sticker on the box.... Although I did read somewhere that they&#x27;ve stopped adding the stickers? But there wasn&#x27;t even a clear sticker sealing the opening of the box to ensure that the product hasn&#x27;t been used yet. I hope I didn&#x27;t get a fake item. (Purchased from Beautyspace if anyone is curious)</li>
    <li> Wish it was a biggger bottle!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The snail recovery gel cream is a decent moisturizer, not really like feel changing but I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone skin. Helps to mattify my skin and control acne. It helps heal my skin faster if i do get a pimple. I no longer have to use a benzoyl peroxide cream everyday. I highly recommend if you have a similar skin type.  edit: This worked... at first. This DID NOT help with hormonal break outs. I ended up using this on popped pimples/wounds only, and it helps heal them. I found a better product for acne breakouts. Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Daily Leave-On Mask with Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I like this. It doesnt irritate my sensitive skin at all. I use this at night with some other products and I have enjoyed having it added to my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> but is requesting the Genus, Species, and Country of Origin for the snail before the review can be completed for export purposes.</li>
    <li> NO major effect noted. I used it once or twice only though. I returned it because it irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> amazing product, diminished acne, cleared skin, closed pores. works from the first day.ive ordered several more. will keep using it.</li>
    <li> still in my first bottle. i seen a lit of clearness on my dark spot but i wish it could help me with my acne too.  but i think it does work just take time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it does anything particularly fancy, but my skin didn&#x27;t seem to struggle with any season so far &amp; did especially well through the transitional seasons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m done with snail cosmetics...the thing caused my skin to break out with cysts...yuck!!! It went to the trash can just like the snail foam cleanser.</li>
    <li> I like this product quite a lot. It&#x27;s not enough for me as a stand alone product so I layer it with other serums and moisturizers or oils. It&#x27;s versatile and pleasant and can be used to deliver nutrition and hydration right up to my eyes without irritation. My skin and eyes are extremely sensitive so I feel this is worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a favorite in our home. A very clean pure product that we purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do the job but great customer. Service</li>
    <li> Been using this almost a month on sun damaged area on my face and hands. Has not done a thing to improve skin.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent</li>
    <li> This is a must have to add to your beauty creams. It is great &amp; has improved my hands,very dry &amp; I use it also on my face!&lt;br /&gt;It works on wrinkles too! Lets hear for the snails!!!! Customer service &amp; delivery all great &amp; on time!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I use it nightly and it has done wonders for old acne scars. My entire complexion looks for even and healthy. I recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my base layer of moisturizer before I put on any makeup.  Or if I just hop out of the shower, I put this on and go on with my day.  It absorbs quickly so your other moisturizers, sunblock, or makeup will not be affected.  I even mix it with medicinal ointment so it absorbs into my skin faster.  Great for spring/summer or when days are too hot for heavy moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snail gel doesn&#x27;t give an immediate effect on larger or old scars.  Over time (~3 weeks of daily application) there was minor change on the childhood scar on my forehead.  It matches my skin tone better compared to the original state.  Also a smoother texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snail gel does stop a blemish or small cut from getting worse.  I woke up one morning to find a pimple on my face I didn&#x27;t know existed was popped.  I applied snail gel daily for about a week.  The healing phase was much faster than if I just left it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought me this and I absolutely love it! It has started to do wonders for my skin! I&#x27;ve been having and still have bad acne scars on my face and when I started using this for the past month, I have noticed my scars fading away slowly! It&#x27;s an amazing buy!</li>
    <li> I loooove this product so much!! It absorbs quickly into the skin and in my opinion leaves it feeling smoother and more supple. The product is lightweight and it has a nice feeling to it, and a little goes a long way so the product lasts longer. It feels kinda like snail slime minus the stickiness but I personally like it a lot. I totally reccomend this product to people of all skin types.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product if you have acne scarring, or any other type of scarring. I&#x27;ve used this for almost a year daily and have noticed significantly scar size and shape reduction... especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat this product. Please don&#x27;t pay more than $7 for this, look elsewhere and you will find it cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on trying more snail products in this line. This gel does not have a smell and has the consistency of gel, but it is not sticky at any time. It dries into the skin in minutes, I usually apply this first and a moisturizer on top.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff.  You need, literally, a dab about the size of a lentil to cover your entire face and neck.  It smooths on, is not sticky, and within a week of 2x daily use, I saw increased elasticity, reduced fine lines, and my 53 year old skin is like silk.</li>
    <li> Hello!  The best product of the year! I plan to give this to everyone I love as gifts designed for turning back the clock.</li>
    <li> Bought mine from ebay, came a few days earlier than the arrival time. BEST THING I EVER PURCHASED!! Makes my skin so nice and smooth! I put this on on top of my moisturizer</li>
    <li> This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to my face since I finished puberty. I have really sensitive, acne prone skin and this has smoothed the crap out of it and makes my skin crazy soft. It also soothes my face if it feels irritated or dry. I put it on after my toner and before my moisturizer and it gives my skin that extra boost of awesome. I would by this in bulk if Mizon sold it.</li>
    <li> I was definitely expecting much more out of this snail gel...I got no results after three weeks of use and almost finishing the entire bottle (which was smaller than I thought it would be, my mistake). I hope others get better results than I did.</li>
    <li> Let me just say, I was really hesitant to use this. After seeing a YouTuber I looked up to rave about this stuff, I decided to splurge a bit and include this in my skin routine for the mornings and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using my serums, I just add a touch of this on all the areas of my face, and then rub it in softly and pat it down. It feels a little sticky after using it, but I like the feeling. And after applying moisturizer, I&#x27;m just left with soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does it all. Reduces redness, reduces acne marks, lightens scars, diminishes wrinkles, and helps even the complexion. I wouldn&#x27;t of believed it had I not tried it, but with continuous use I&#x27;ve seen positive results! I&#x27;ll totally buy this again in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely adore! Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> The hype is real! I have oily, acne prone skin with large pores that is sensitive and prone to redness and this has improved the texture of it so much. My skin looks smooth, even, and calm. I look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup even when I&#x27;m not! It doesn&#x27;t make me oily, didn&#x27;t break me out at all, and absorbs quickly so doesn&#x27;t add much time to my routine. I have not seen a single pimple since starting to use this in the evenings, even during that time of the month. I have seen reduction in the few fine lines on my forehead (I&#x27;m 29 but no major signs of aging yet) and have now started using this under my eyes to see if it helps with the fine lines there. As others have said this is a treatment and not a moisturizer. You will probably need to moisturize on top of this even if you have oily skin. Honestly I can&#x27;t believe the price of this as it works better than some of the $100+ serums and treatments I have tried in the past. Korean skincare is really top notch.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with a lot of blackheads and scars. This product has been helping lighten the scars and not making me break out more. It&#x27;s even helped my pores look smaler. Wonderful product. I just ordered the whole mizon snail line!</li>
    <li> Smells like regular lotion. Clear gel consistency.  It actually helped in clearing up the redness in my face because of my sensitive inflamed skin. I use it before my moisturizer.  It absorbs quickly but leaves a tight feeling on my skin if I do moisturize afterwards. The size of the tube was much larger then expected.  It comes in a box and is sealed under the twist cap.</li>
    <li> AMAZING product, leaving my skin feeling silky smooth with a perfect gel texture.  No scent, no grease, nothing unpleasant at all.  OVERALL GREAT PRODUCT for smooth skin and healing of redness on the face.</li>
    <li> Must have for dry skin types!</li>
    <li> The texture I would say is more gel than cream.  It has no detectable scent and is not greasy at all.  I was very interested in this product because I have acne prone skin with dark spots and I would like to prevent wrinkles.  It got such rave reviews, I had to try it.  I think the price is pretty good considering targeted treatments are usually very pricey in the U.S.  A pea sized amount will cover your whole face.  It absorbed in quickly and my skin felt soft.  Although it&#x27;s been a short time, I do notice my darker spots don&#x27;t look as obvious.  My skin feels smooth and a little brighter.  This is a very nice all purpose treatment.  I&#x27;m eager to try a snail eye treatment next.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! Fast shipping ever! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Beware of the seller Bizaroo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product before and had great results, decided to purchase it again but this time it was from the seller Bizaroo...&lt;br /&gt;My product came without the authentication sticker and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me, but the color of the tube seems slightly darker and also the smell of it was different from the ones I have previously. I am 100% sure what I got was fake. Returned.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look like I&#x27;m 19 again! Evens out tone, reduces redness- a big one for me because I have rosacea- fixes dullness, helps heal blemishes and scars too. Did not irritate my sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t try it on the eye area because my skin is very weird there but for the rest of my face it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s not exactly a &#x27;cream&#x27; and not a moisturizer so if you have really dry skin you might want to put cream on top of it.</li>
    <li> This does make my skin feel very soft. Shipped promptly.</li>
