      <li>(The bleaching kit is awesome!</li>
      <li>And Its Still Bright</li>
      <li>I used a white-out kit, got my hair good &amp; bleached, and tried again with the color:</li>
      <li>Put it in my hair, and waited a good 2-2.5 hours.</li>
      <li>A good 8-9 hours, my hair soaking in the mixture.</li>
      <li>It honestly looks like I died my hair six months ago</li>
      <li>I have to go but another type of dye remember spat is better than this piece of sparkly sh</li>
      <li>went to the shower to get a better rinsing.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of it</li>
      <li>I have messaged the company and they better give me a refund.</li>
      <li>I gave it three stars mostly because the fading isn&#x27;t really uniform.</li>
      <li>Granted I did high lift my hair first since my hair is ash blonde, but this product is excellent for not being professional level.</li>
      <li>It really depends how light your hair is.</li>

      <li>(If you&#x27;re looking for something that will fade more completely, try Manic Panic.)</li>
      <li>the color fades to a nice silvery blue</li>
      <li>I actually get more compliments on my washed-out hair than my freshly dyed hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is short enough that one bottle lasts two or three touch ups too, so it&#x27;s a pretty great bargain for $5.</li>
      <li>So the next time, I bleached my hair very light</li>
      <li>Ok, first Of All I Have Been Dying My Hair Red FoR Over 11 Years.</li>
      <li>The color that comes out of the tube is actually really pretty, so I just went for it.</li>

      <li>This is not my first non-natural hair coloring experience.</li>
      <li>In the back it spread until just about all of the top layer of my hair was dyed.</li>
      <li>I like my blue hair, but I can&#x27;t be bothered to re-dye my hair more than once a year.</li>
      <li>My hair was still a little damp, this was before I got online and read how best results are on dry hair.</li>

      <li>And Sally Beauty Supply has a wide range of colors for pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>I have very porous hair that takes dye very well naturally, but since this was a semi permanent</li>
      <li>I did it a lot in high school, so I&#x27;m no newbie.</li>
      <li>I even did my hair another two times to see if it would turn out a little better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all about knowing the color wheel and having the right shade of blonde hair.</li>
      <li>It had the same effect on the right side of my head.</li>
      <li>First time we bleached and dyed, we decided we would try again with a different bleach.</li>
      <li>I did use a color sealer conditioner to rinse it out and only try to wash my hair every other day with color safe shampoo always using the color sealer conditioner.</li>
      <li>Also compared to other dyes this one took awhile to clean off on parts where it made contact with my skin.</li>
      <li>And yet when I&#x27;d rinsed and dried it, what was left looked like I&#x27;d spent too much time in a swimming pool rather than the bright turquoise advertised.</li>
      <li>not only did it not due the first time I dyed it again</li>
      <li>Well, that completely didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Anyway, more color came out that morning (the first time I used shampoo since about two days ago) and I was left with varying shades of green, blonde, and white.</li>
      <li>I have about 6 high lift streaks that I touch up occasionally (use foil)</li>
      <li>We ended up with a color that we let soak in for 20 minutes only to have it completely wash out!</li>
      <li>It is very intense for the first few days and naturally it levels down being that it&#x27;s a semi permanent.</li>
      <li>Makes a huge difference using foil to maintain the correct moisture while it sets in and I put a cap on (actually just plastic wrap) and add heat with blow dryer for the last few minutes of process.</li>

      <li>I stopped using solely bc of the red tones, but the color was very vibrant and lasted a couple weeks with minimal washing.</li>

<li> blonde, COMPLETELY saturated my hair with color (we&#x27;re talking half a bottle of dye for just the tips), and left it on for twice the time recommended on the bottle.</li>
<li> It left my blonde dyed bangs a soft green blonde - not the desired effect.</li>
<li> I also read countless times to apply it to dry hair and leave in for 4-5 hours, so I left it in for 6 immediately after lightening.</li>
<li> you leave it long enough on.</li>
<li> and then I randomly add color lightly through toward the end of process to add different depths (i don&#x27;t put foil on these spots).</li>
<li> and it was a complete mess.</li>
<li> I now have green blonde hair and am having to go back to the store for a different brand of color to correct this screw up.</li>
<li> The color is a deep red base purple which for me turned out to be more of a hassle as it amped the red tones in my bleached hair.</li>
<li> We turned my hair almost white (it had been.bleached twice) except for the pink that was from Splat!.</li>
<li> It looks like it did nothing to her on darker hair spots which we assumed would have turned a dark blue and</li>
<li> I have fairly dark brown hair that I treated with bleach by the same manufacturer before using this turquoise dye.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to dye my hair a mint green sort of color, so I mixed the dye with conditioner to lighten it up.</li>
<li> It Does Absolutely No Damage To Your Hair</li>
<li> but I still expected a darker greener color to come out.</li>
<li> A green blonde.</li>
<li> By the second wash it was green.</li>
<li> I use Color Jamz over other brands because it stays forever.</li>
<li> With these dyes (usually Huckleberry Blue feat.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than other dyes</li>
<li> The color was not consistent.</li>
<li> A few bits took a little color, but the rest stayed blonde (Maybe a little greenish in areas, but not much)&lt;br</li>
<li> Dont even bother buying this, its not worth it.</li>
<li> My hair lightened to the shade of the bottle to the left, a pale, pale green.</li>
<li> Wear gloves and put down newspaper when you&#x27;re dyeing.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs down.</li>
<li> Unfortunately for me I didn&#x27;t process my hair enough while bleaching it and ended up with different colors as it faded.</li>
<li> it wont work on just brown hair you have to bleach it to at least a pale blonde</li>
<li> All it did was dye my skin and make a mess.</li>
<li> Everything washed out except for a slight amount of green tint at my slightly lighter roots.</li>
<li> the fading is random, On my hair it was red and pink bit turned green and pink in my cousins hair.</li>
<li> get this product if you just want to sit around with dye on your head for 5 hours, but don&#x27;t ACTUALLY want dyed hair (Or at least, results that are predictable!)</li>
<li> I just look like I dyed my hair green two months ago and never reapplied dye.</li>
<li> When I looked in the mirror I had sea foam green hair.</li>
<li> Turned it poop green.</li>
<li> dried it to lock in the color.</li>
<li> : I bleach my hair (rinse), brush on the dye, wait a few hours or even overnight, and then rinse.</li>
<li> Major fail.</li>
<li> I wanted to refresh my (admittedly, pretty badly faded) teal in my bangs.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed, since I figured this was sure to work after everything I did.</li>
<li> but unfortunately the dye did not stick, even after I left it in for 30 minutes and blow</li>
<li> Very bummed :-(</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a sucker for on sale items.</li>
<li> I did everything one could do to enhance this dye, hair cap, applied heat every 20 minutes, rinsed with ice cold water, applied a color lock deep conditioner with no shampoo, and nothing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve ever used, given the teal colors fade faster, this product barely lasted the RINSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs down. Will stick with Pravana, this product should be discontinued.</li>
    <li> My friend and I went and bleached our hair with the intent to dye it a teal blue color. We picked up the Tripped Up Turquoise. This is not my first non-natural hair coloring experience. I did it a lot in high school, so I&#x27;m no newbie. But what I failed to do was go for the brands I already knew worked. I&#x27;m a sucker for on sale items. So what happened? We ended up with a color that we let soak in for 20 minutes only to have it completely wash out! It left my blonde dyed bangs a soft green blonde - not the desired effect. My friend? It looks like it did nothing to her on darker hair spots which we assumed would have turned a dark blue and the lighter spots looked like mine. A green blonde. Major fail. I even did my hair another two times to see if it would turn out a little better. Nope. I just look like I dyed my hair green two months ago and never reapplied dye. I now have green blonde hair and am having to go back to the store for a different brand of color to correct this screw up. I have messaged the company and they better give me a refund. This was the worst dying experience I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair to an orange color. Then i dyed crimson storm over it and left it on 2 1/2 hours, Well i want to go white/silver/lavender now and i CANNOT strip this color. i&#x27;ve tried clarifying shampoo and bleaching it and now it&#x27;s bright pink. It doesnt want to go anywhere! That&#x27;s another thing, when i thought &amp;#34;crimson&amp;#34; i didn&#x27;t think magenta. This color is FUCHSIA. Anyway, if you do that, the color will stick forever.</li>
    <li> Finally got around to doing my hair today.  It completely washed out :-( hair was bleached so color should of held, even used the hair dryer on it to intensify color like it said. Very bummed :-(</li>
    <li> I bought this from a local beauty store and wanted to warn potential buyers before you order! I have fairly dark brown hair that I treated with bleach by the same manufacturer before using this turquoise dye. The bleach worked well but unfortunately the dye did not stick, even after I left it in for 30 minutes and blow dried it to lock in the color. It honestly looks like I died my hair six months ago and now I have this ugly ash blond with some moss green streaks in it where the dye decided to semi-stick. Definitely going to try and get an exchange at the beauty store tomorrow...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had lackluster experiences with this brand before, so I don&#x27;t know why I even bothered (I do actually know, it&#x27;s because this brand has a few more ounces in the bottle than the other one I was looking at). I thought if I lightened my hair enough the color might actually take... well, you can see how that didn&#x27;t work out when you look at my pic:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to dye my hair a mint green sort of color, so I mixed the dye with conditioner to lighten it up. My hair was still a little damp, this was before I got online and read how best results are on dry hair. I waited a little bit (about 30-40 minutes, basically whatever it says on the bottle) then washed it out with cold water. There went ALL the color, right down the drain! Hmm, well okay, two can play at this game! So I drentched my hair in the conditioner-dye mix once again, covered it in tin foil, and went to bed for the night. A good 8-9 hours, my hair soaking in the mixture. The first picture in the pic is the results of this. A few bits took a little color, but the rest stayed blonde (Maybe a little greenish in areas, but not much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So cut to today, about 3 days later. I decide I don&#x27;t need the mint. (My hair probably wasn&#x27;t lightened enough for it to turn out the color I want and also too damaged to bleach again) The color that comes out of the tube is actually really pretty, so I just went for it. Put it in my hair, and waited a good 2-2.5 hours. I washed it out and... the second pic is the result you see. I wouldn&#x27;t be SO upset with it (It&#x27;s KIND of what I wanted, a soft pastel-like color) if it was the same throughout my hair, but it&#x27;s not... I have this weird green-blonde streak in it now. WTF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So get this product if you just want to sit around with dye on your head for 5 hours, but don&#x27;t ACTUALLY want dyed hair (Or at least, results that are predictable!) It&#x27;s a blast!</li>
    <li> Its all I use and it keeps its color!</li>
    <li> I tried purple passion after my ion brilliance purple stopped working on my hair. I applied the dye and I think that a lot of people don&#x27;t realize what a learning process it is to have &amp;#34;fantasy&amp;#34; hair. It&#x27;s all about knowing the color wheel and having the right shade of blonde hair. Unfortunately for me I didn&#x27;t process my hair enough while bleaching it and ended up with different colors as it faded. The color is a deep red base purple which for me turned out to be more of a hassle as it amped the red tones in my bleached hair. Other dyes I used always faded into blue tones but this particular shade faded into red and pink tones. It really depends how light your hair is. I stopped using solely bc of the red tones, but the color was very vibrant and lasted a couple weeks with minimal washing. I gave it three stars mostly because the fading isn&#x27;t really uniform. the fading is random, On my hair it was red and pink bit turned green and pink in my cousins hair. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than other dyes but for me wasn&#x27;t worth it since I hated the way it faded. Also compared to other dyes this one took awhile to clean off on parts where it made contact with my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this Tripped Up Turquois and it was a complete mess. I left it in my hair for an hour. I rinsed it out. When I looked in the mirror I had sea foam green hair. The color was not consistent. I had patches of blonde hair that had no color on it. I will never buy this product again. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried this dye twice in my hair. First time we bleached and dyed, we decided we would try again with a different bleach. We turned my hair almost white (it had been.bleached twice) except for the pink that was from Splat!. That color held steady.&lt;br /&gt;Twice it did not work!&lt;br /&gt;This dye is really bad dye! Just get Splat!. It&#x27;s cheaper because the bleach is in the box already. Won&#x27;t be trying this again.</li>
    <li> I use Color Jamz over other brands because it stays forever. (If you&#x27;re looking for something that will fade more completely, try Manic Panic.) I like my blue hair, but I can&#x27;t be bothered to re-dye my hair more than once a year. With these dyes (usually Huckleberry Blue feat. Tripped up Turquoise or Not-So-Shy Violet) the color fades to a nice silvery blue so I don&#x27;t feel the need to dye it all the time. I actually get more compliments on my washed-out hair than my freshly dyed hair. My hair is short enough that one bottle lasts two or three touch ups too, so it&#x27;s a pretty great bargain for $5. Plus it smells like blue Airheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: I bleach my hair (rinse), brush on the dye, wait a few hours or even overnight, and then rinse. Wear gloves and put down newspaper when you&#x27;re dyeing. If you rinse in the shower, wear gloves and do not tip your head forward. I&#x27;ve found baking soda works for removing stains. And Sally Beauty Supply has a wide range of colors for pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair and decided to put this in it. Turned it poop green. This product should be discontinued</li>
    <li> I figured that because my hair is pretty light (dirty blonde or so), I could get away with dyeing my hair without bleach. Well, that completely didn&#x27;t work. So the next time, I bleached my hair very light blonde, COMPLETELY saturated my hair with color (we&#x27;re talking half a bottle of dye for just the tips), and left it on for twice the time recommended on the bottle. And yet when I&#x27;d rinsed and dried it, what was left looked like I&#x27;d spent too much time in a swimming pool rather than the bright turquoise advertised. From now on I&#x27;m sticking with Manic Panic.</li>
    <li> I wanted to refresh my (admittedly, pretty badly faded) teal in my bangs. I bought \\&quot;Tripped Up Turquoise\\&quot;, and applied following the instructions: nothing happened, the color didn&#x27;t change at all. I thought \\&quot;Well, maybe I just need to re-bleach and it&#x27;ll look better.\\&quot; Nope. I used a white-out kit, got my hair good &amp; bleached, and tried again with the color: nothing happened. Not only did I follow the instructions, but I left it on much longer the second time around. After rinsing, there was only the slightest hint of color, and one shampoo later it&#x27;s all gone. Don&#x27;t bother with this product, categorically the worst dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I bought this not reading the reviews first remember always read the reviews not only did it not due the first time I dyed it again and it still didn&#x27;t dye so now I have to go but another type of dye remember spat is better than this piece of sparkly sh**</li>
    <li> This hair dye is horrible! I bought it about a month ago at Sally&#x27;s and I finally had time to use it. I dyed my hair in stripes around my head. In the back it spread until just about all of the top layer of my hair was dyed. It had the same effect on the right side of my head. I used Beyond the Zone&#x27;s bleaching kit prior to using this color. (The bleaching kit is awesome! It gives you a nice blonde color but darks some until it&#x27;s carmel-le) I rinsed my hair in the kitchen sink then went then went to the shower to get a better rinsing. Color was POURING out of my hair. Turns out, all of the color came out. By the second wash it was green. When I went to Sally&#x27;s yesterday to find a way to fix it the bottles were arranged by color. My hair lightened to the shade of the bottle to the left, a pale, pale green. I looked like a mermaid! I showered again that morning to try and make it lighten, because shampoo removes color. Anyway, more color came out that morning (the first time I used shampoo since about two days ago) and I was left with varying shades of green, blonde, and white. Yes, white. Over all review of this product? DO NOT USE!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, first Of All I Have Been Dying My Hair Red FoR Over 11 Years. I&#x27;ve Used Every Brand Out There At One Point. I Used This Around Seven Years Ago After Constantly dishing Out Cash For Manic Panic For 6 Years. I Followed The Directions And The Dye Barely Even Clung To My Hair.That Was The Problem  I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS!!!! Recently I Went Back To It. To Get The Vibrant red, Bleach Your Hair To A Coppery Blonde And Slather The Dye On Dry Hair. Leave It On For Hours Or Go To Sleep In It And You Won&#x27;t Be Disappointed. It Does Absolutely No Damage To Your Hair Because Its A Vegetable Based dye. Its Been Weeks And Its Still Bright As Ever!!!! tried To Switch Shades And It Even Lasted Through Bleach Using 40 Developer. Its Less Expensive Than Most Unnatural Dyes To!! I Will NEVER Use A Different Brand Of Dye Again!!!</li>
    <li> I have very porous hair that takes dye very well naturally, but since this was a semi permanent i figured I should still lighten it anyway, so I did. I also read countless times to apply it to dry hair and leave in for 4-5 hours, so I left it in for 6 immediately after lightening. It wasn&#x27;t lightened to a white but I still expected a darker greener color to come out. I did everything one could do to enhance this dye, hair cap, applied heat every 20 minutes, rinsed with ice cold water, applied a color lock deep conditioner with no shampoo, and nothing. Everything washed out except for a slight amount of green tint at my slightly lighter roots. I am very disappointed, since I figured this was sure to work after everything I did.</li>
    <li> Dont even bother buying this, its not worth it. Save your money unless u want an ugly mint color almost. I dont think u should buy this dye.</li>
    <li> Granted I did high lift my hair first since my hair is ash blonde, but this product is excellent for not being professional level. I did use a color sealer conditioner to rinse it out and only try to wash my hair every other day with color safe shampoo always using the color sealer conditioner. It is very intense for the first few days and naturally it levels down being that it&#x27;s a semi permanent. I have about 6 high lift streaks that I touch up occasionally (use foil) and then I randomly add color lightly through toward the end of process to add different depths (i don&#x27;t put foil on these spots). Makes a huge difference using foil to maintain the correct moisture while it sets in and I put a cap on (actually just plastic wrap) and add heat with blow dryer for the last few minutes of process. Love the smell of it and it also does not dry my hair, actually quite moisturizing.</li>
    <li> you leave it long enough on. (several hours)&lt;br /&gt;no it wont work on just brown hair you have to bleach it to at least a pale blonde</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  I have tried it for the recommended processing time and for over 90 minutes and it did NOTHING.  My hair is light blonde.  All it did was dye my skin and make a mess.</li>
</ol>
