<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Havent used yet but the brushes are very soft. They feal sturdy and were delivered on time. Look forward to using.</li>
    <li> Great set and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loveeeee these brushes. They are comparable to the high end brands. Smooth foundation application and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the hairs falling out or anything. I washed them before I used them too so they are sturdy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted very good brushes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a few weeks now and find myself constantly grabbing these as opposed to my more &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; ones ... not bad at all! Also had a problem with a brush and the company was wonderful in sending me a quick replacement - Thank YOU! :)</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Just make sure you clean them cause they smell like glue at first.</li>
    <li> Love my brushes. Will be purchasing more soon. Soft, and delicate on my skin so I am sure my clients will fall in love!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. The cost is low, but the quality is wonderful. The bristles are soft and none has fallen off on my face (the way my old ones did - they were Bare Escentuals brushes). Even after a wash, they remained soft, which is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them mainly for powder foundation, powder blush, and powder concealer. I don&#x27;t like using brushes for liquid make-up - it&#x27;s much better to pat them into your skin, as it provides a fresher, more radiant, and more natural-looking coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend these brushes enough!!</li>
    <li> Good brush set for the price.</li>
    <li> They work wonderfully! They only fault is that they do have a strong chemical smell to them, but other than that, they blend eyeshadow and foundation great!!! Super impressed!</li>
    <li> These are the softest brushes and get the job done!</li>
    <li> these brushes are exactly what i thought they would be. great price for what you get. I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far and i&#x27;ve been using them for about a month.</li>
    <li> For the price, such a great value. Obviously like all cheap brushes, handles can come apart easily. Just reglue and they&#x27;re fine. As someone who is both a makeup fanatic as well as a thrifty shopper, I recommend this for anyone who wants a good starter set bit doesn&#x27;t want to pay too much.</li>
    <li> When I first got the brushes in the mail, I was super excited! They look and almost exactly as I hoped. some of the brushes are not as fluffy as I would have liked. They smelled a little funky, more of a chemical smell, but i&#x27;ve noticed that with many brushes I have purchased over the years, and after you wash them, they owe the smell completely. They also shed just a tiny bit, but nothing too serious or noticeable. For the price, these brushes do the job and I would recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> Shedding with some brushes. Missing an eyeshadow flat brush to be an ideal eye and face set</li>
    <li> Really liked them at first, but within the first two weeks one of the brushes completely broke in half. Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> For the price they are decent. One of the larger brushes shed so bad I had to throw it away, but the rest are holding together. This is a good choice if you are on a budget or starting out and don&#x27;t know how each type of brush works.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product I will definitely recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She loves it!! She said this is the BEST brushes she ever had! Definitely recommend this! and the seller &amp;#34;Bravolink&amp;#34; is excellent!</li>
    <li> In love with these brushes!! I was afraid they&#x27;d be crapoy since there so cheap, but they are awesome! They don&#x27;t shed, and apply the makeup perfect!</li>
    <li> Love these make up brushes</li>
    <li> the brushes are very soft and are multipurpose at first they come with a weird smell but after you wash them you are good to go</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, price and shipment speed.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good brushes! I&#x27;ve been using them everyday for months and still in good shape.</li>
    <li> I really like these kabuki brush is they are extremely soft and they work extremely well with liquids or powders and they apply very easily and evenly one letdown is that they have minor shedding everyone&#x27;s in a while I will find a little piece of hair on my face but it&#x27;s okay.. easy to deal with!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes!! Affordable price</li>
    <li> The best make up brushes Ieper had!!!! These are the only ones I use... The best purchase ever!!!!</li>
    <li> First of all I love the brushes. Literally when I put my foundation on and used them, it melted seamlessly into my skin. However, the smell turpentine-like smell is TRUE. I was then repeatedly and had to soak them for hours in VINEGAR TWICE! Besides the odor, these are a 10!</li>
    <li> Great brushes blends out well very happy</li>
    <li> Great brushes great buy..!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
    <li> Soft brushes. I liked how the bottom part of the brush was matte. However the gold part has a lot faded spots, and I expected the brushes to have had the hairs glued down to the very bottom and to be more dense (some are, some aren&#x27;t) you can also see glue in some of them. They do look very inexpensive but for the price, you get what you pay for. They&#x27;re ok for Sigma dupes.</li>
    <li> Perfect and as described! Exactly what is in the picture. Haven&#x27;t tried them out just yet, but they are extra soft. Thank you</li>
    <li> Works just as good as my more expensive brushes. I would highly recommend them to anyone, why spend more money when these are just as good?</li>
    <li> So Good! I love them! Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet. I just got them in the mail an hour ago but they are so soft and they look exactly like they do in the picture. I&#x27;m so excited to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;QLa-k_rgaA4</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes very soft and are exactly the product in the picture and super fast shipping</li>
    <li> super cute and sturdy, perfect for my makeup bag!!</li>
    <li> You get so many brushes for next to nothing!  They come wrapped in plastic and I&#x27;ll admit, they do have a strong chemical smell when you first remove them from the plastic.  I let mine air out and now they are just fine.  They are very soft and apply my mineral makeup perfectly.  I havent experienced any shedding like some of the other reviewers have stated, nor have they come apart.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and definitely recommend these brushes.  Debi B.</li>
    <li> Pro:I tried sigma, real technique and this brand. Sigma are better, real technique are great this brand is satisfying. The bristles are soft and dense. Your makeup will spread  evenly with no streaks nor shedding. The produts are not wasted you wear it on your face it does not stay on the brush. They are inexpensive yet good, what&#x27;s not to like... you won&#x27;t regret your purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: the handles are not sturdy these can be fixed with crazy glue:)</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes for the price. I have had them for a month or so and I have had no problems with shedding or the ferrule separating from the handle. They are extremely soft, softer than my real techniques brushes. Also nice variety of sizes and brush shapes.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Just what I needed and a great price!</li>
    <li> love these brush so proffesional</li>
    <li> Premium synthetic yes. The size was a little misleading. While these brushes are a wonderful synthetic they are a little smaller than what was expected. They are still great for everything except powder. I would purchase these with a large setting powder brush or powder puff.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Loved each and every brush I&#x27;ve used (I haven&#x27;t found the need of some brushes yet, but when I do, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be just as great). Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> AMAZING, I don&#x27;t need my last brushes these replace them 1000x more♡♡♡</li>
    <li> Love these brushes just wish it came with a fan brush</li>
    <li> These brushes are legit! They are soft to the &#x27;T&#x27;, they look professional. When I received the brushes, they were wrapped pretty good; only drawback is that they&#x27;re not labeled. I found a brish guide in someone else&#x27;s review on these brushes &amp; went ahead to writing down my own guide. Can&#x27;t wait to use these!</li>
    <li> Great value for 10 brushes . My only complaints were that one of the brushes started to lose hair after being washed and I had to crazy glue another one but that was pretty much it.  They are quite soft and for the amount I paid for it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> These are so soft and work very well when blending my foundation.</li>
    <li> These are great blending brushes that are dupes from BH.  Great bristles blends beautifully</li>
    <li> The brush hairs started to come off as soon as I took them out of the package. Not satisfied! Only love how soft the brush hairs are.</li>
    <li> blends nice, nice quality</li>
    <li> Love them. There great brushes</li>
    <li> very good! I love this item!</li>
    <li> I purchased these a few months ago, and recently took them on a girl&#x27;s trip. My friend is a professional MUA and asked what kind of brushes they were and where I got them from. She absolutely loved them. These brushes are soft and durable, and apply product very well. I have purchased much more expensive brushes and the handle was seperating from the base before you could get a few good uses out of them. These are excellent and the price is just awesome. I had to buy a set for my friend so that she could start using them immediately in her kit.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AWESOME!!! You&#x27;re guaranteed a FLAWLESS look with every use.</li>
    <li> wonderful! Fast shipping and sleek design. Unbelievably soft and incredibly effective at blending and zero fallout.</li>
    <li> the reason for my 4 out of 5 rating is because of the snow it is a very strong snow of paint which is hurting my head but they are really soft and they are great Kali I have pulled tugged washed and even use my foundation and does not leave any hairs behind at first it has hair hanging out of my flat top brush but it was nothing that was too extreme really good product so far by any means we&#x27;ll keep an update as the week goes will be trained every single brush just to make sure I am giving you guys a great view will be taken up later on this week by any means its great</li>
    <li> Other than not knowing what brush was what at first-I love them!  They are soft, work well, and NO stray hairs on my face!!! I used a link from another customer to find out what each brush was actually used for.</li>
    <li> brushes are super soft and delivered quickly. the eyeshadow brushes are bigger than expected, but they are still good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> If your going the inexpensive route,  is a nice product.</li>
    <li> These brushes feel really good. They had a slight smell that went away a few days after washing them. They blend make up fairly well.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price. Flawless coverage. I ordered them on the 13th and received them on the 21st. Great for travel and they do have a chemical smell but it fades. I&#x27;ve used them daily and there is no fallout. Overall a great buy and easy to clean. Will repurchase when need be.</li>
    <li> Great quality! I love these brushes. I bought a large pack of a cheaper version, and they shed like crazy. These have been great, and have helped me achieve great results from my cheap make up :0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that you clean them often as they tend to hold onto foundation. I clean mine once every two weeks, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in their quality.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality and affordable price.I use the everyday.</li>
    <li> I received them way before predicted. Love when things come in early!&lt;br /&gt;They did smell funny when I first opened them but the smell has gone away now. They are so soft and amazing quality. Exactly what any makeup fanatic needs! They are exactly as describe and I can&#x27;t believe the price for the amazing quality!&lt;br /&gt;100% recommend</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!! I use about 4 of these all of the time.  They are great.  The others aren&#x27;t really in my routine but are great quality</li>
    <li> so far so good, very soft brushes only used once so far....  packing came secure and fast.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love these brushes</li>
    <li> Really great product other than that God awful paint smell and the fact that the handles on the brushes came off after just a week of using them. I didnt use them  for the first few days and left them open to air so the smell would go away.  I also just hot glued the handles back on with my glue gun and it&#x27;s pretty study now, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do all of this. Despite all of this though, the brushes feel amazing on my face. They&#x27;re really soft and my makeup looks like it was done by a professional. Hopefully when you purchase it, you won&#x27;t have as many issues, but it&#x27;s worth a try if you don&#x27;t mind doing a little bit extra work for the brushes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good set of brushes. SUPER FAST SHIPPING and even better customer service. Good brushes for beginners if your not ready to spend a lot of money on mac brushes. There&#x27;s a strong chemical smell but I don&#x27;t mind. Overall, great purchase.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought it would be. Bristles are somewhat weak</li>
    <li> The brushes definitely have that chemical initial smell but as i left them sitting out i no longer smelled it. The brushes are super soft and the variety was amazing. If you can get past the inital smell, I feel the price for the set and the quality is GREAT!</li>
    <li> The brushes feel great but the handles have broken off of two of them. I haven&#x27;t had these brushes for more than two months and have only used them a hand full of times. Bummed that they aren&#x27;t more sturdy.</li>
    <li> You definitely get what you paid for. I think they are good quality brushes for the price you pay. Make sure you wash them prior to use, but they are exactly like the brushes in the picture!</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but better than I&#x27;d expect for the cost, glad I purchased</li>
    <li> For the price, you CANNOT beat these brushes. Yes, there is a bit of shedding, but they work beautifully. Softer than some brushes I have paid much more for. My contour game has been on point since I received these. No complaints.</li>
    <li> not as dense as i hoped but overall these are VERYYYY good quality brushes</li>
    <li> Really great quality. Soft and do not shed.</li>
    <li> Smells syntetic (exceeding usual level) and one of the brushes broke right away.</li>
    <li> great value for the price</li>
    <li> i was surprised at how nice these are for the price i paid, i feel like i need more. these are great brushes and i use them everyday</li>
    <li> Threw it away...the smell was awful and I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t need this many brushes, but the brushes themselves are really good.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, but the metal portion separates from the wooden handle easily and needs to be reglued.</li>
    <li> love these brushes there soft and last long i will buy more if needed</li>
    <li> They seem to be good quality but when I opened reh&amp;eacute;n has very strong plastic smeell</li>
    <li> I was expecting really cheap quality for the price but must admit, I&#x27;m quite pleased with these brushes. Especially the foundation &amp; blush brushes. Good value!</li>
    <li> Super nice and good range of sizes in just this pack! Very affordable, and easily cleanable since they&#x27;re synthetic.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love, these brushes are great! I haven&#x27;t had any to shed and they feel soft against the skin.</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes! Such a great deal and they&#x27;re similar to the bh cosmetic brushes. Definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for good quality brushes at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> They need a little more glue to keep the handle on but other then that these work great!</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushed it applies my foundation so smoothly. This is defiantly a great buy!</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes.  They are all round top brushes, but are of a good quality.  I pulled each of them and &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; came out.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Out of the 5 face brushes i liked 4. Pretty decent brushes, also very soft. One of my brushes sheds alot but my brushes came in good condition. Also the smell wasnt even strong as people exagerated. Most of them are used for liquid foundation, but you can use them however you&#x27;d like. I rate it a 4 cause of the shedding.</li>
    <li> These are worth the price.  I have same version in Sigma brushes but these are a low cost second pair to throw in my makeup bag.  Give them a wash and you may need to re-glue a handle.  No big deal.</li>
    <li> These are nice, soft brushes and seem to be a good value for the money. I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> This brushes actually work perfect for their price point. I am defenitely not an expert with makeup yet so I did not want to spend the money on expensive brushes. These apply make up perfect and are easy to clean. There is little to no hair loss of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Horrible after the first wash they started to fall apart</li>
    <li> Just received my brushes and they are clearly have been used I guess I received a return they have foundation marks and tissues in the middle of the brushes. It&#x27;s disgusting!</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely gorgeous. In addition to the fact that they work wonderfully! Almost too well! I&#x27;ll be honest. I have never owned any high end brushes such as Sigma, MAC ie so I can&#x27;t really compare how the brushes fair through daily use. However, the few times i have used a MAC brush, I must say that the functionality and softness of the brushes are the same. The brushes pick up my product extremely well and apply very well as well. I definitely feel as if no product goes to waste. I must mention that I&#x27;ve only used ELF and the Dragon makeup brushes sold on here as well. This is wayyyy better than Elf by ten fold. And cheaper! Again, they don&#x27;t waste product and they are much much much softer than my Elf brushes. The Dragon brushes, they work fairly well but the difference in quality is there. This brush set is much much softer. If you&#x27;re stuck between purchasing the Dragon brushes and these (like I was), I definitely recommend these over the Dragon brushes. However if you&#x27;re looking for an insane amount of brushes ( or you&#x27;re new and want to try several different types of brushes brushes) ...then go for the Dragon brushes because the difference in quality isn&#x27;t that significant .</li>
    <li> amazing brushes! The quality is amazing. The smaller brushes are a bit thicker and bigger but these brushes are soooo worth it!</li>
    <li> So soft,  allows for smooth flawless coverage.  I bought these on recommendation when I ordered my bare minerals.  The two together are amazing.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING! I thought they were going to be low quality but I was soooo wrong. Great quality, super soft and they feel great on hands. I have Sephora and real techniques brushes and these are my favorite now.</li>
    <li> No joke when I say this is the best set of brushes that I&#x27;ve ever owned ! What a bang for the buck ! I honestly was expecting some cheap brushes but man was I wrong . Going to buy some more as gifts for Christmas</li>
    <li> Exceptional bargain, good quality and good selection.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brushes, I am very impressed with their blending and softness.  I own quite a few name brand brushes, and I have to say amazingly these rival any of those!  I was going off other reviews, but was quite curious if they would actually be impressive.  Happily I can report they are awesome!</li>
    <li> These are nice. They&#x27;re soft and help me get the best coverage out of my makeup.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes!! So soft, and they are still in excellent condition even after 2 months!</li>
    <li> This brush are very soft and nice to use</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. I have never used brushes before to be able to compare but I know that they are super soft and they make my makeup look flawless......I love them, and for the price I will probably be getting a backup set soon. Smelled like chemicals when I got them and maybe should have washed them first but I was so anxious I just went ahead and used them..... eeek.....oh well</li>
    <li> Loved them !!! By far they are Good quality brushes .. Nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Great brushes, very very dense.  Use this for applying foundating, and real good for undereye concealer.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a funny smell to the brushes. Make sure to wash it before using it. Overall, the brush works well and it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you paid for. Got these brushes and already the top came off. The brush top came right off as soon as I took it out the plastic covering. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very good brushes for the price. Such a good deal! Plus pretty fast delivery.</li>
    <li> When I got my brushes , I was pleased on first sight, then the smell over took me, they smell like terpetine, whats with that, is that normal... help anyone.....</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes.. You get so many great brushes for such a great price.&lt;br /&gt;They work really well, are soft, and don&#x27;t leave any bristles on your face like some brushes too.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> They feel awesome and do their job perfectly</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY YOU&#x27;RE SPENDING!</li>
    <li> very good brushes..rated it a 4 star because one of my brushes already unglued.</li>
    <li> Great price for quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes just dNt wash them to hard</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I got them in two days. They are so soft and very affordable! You get a lot for your money. I was thinking that they wouldn&#x27;t be very good quality, but they are amazing! You get a nice variety of brushes for only 11 dollars! So much better than the drugstore brushes. The only complaint is that they had a weird smell when i first got them, but the smell when away when i washed them! I would definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> These are not what I expected, then again can&#x27;t expect much with the price tag. These are super soft....so soft that they only apply makeup way too sheer. I only used them one time because I cannot deal with the smell! Not to mention I soaked them in soap and alcohol then washed them with brush cleaner...twice! They smell like exactly like a can of spray paint! Ewwww!</li>
    <li> The brushes smell a bit and they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as other brushes I own.  I guess in this case you get what you pay for which is ok.</li>
    <li> They came super fast and were incredibly soft. Only con was the handles smelled strongly like paint but once you wash them they&#x27;re perfect. No shedding!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them ! The brushes are super soft! And work well with my pallets ! I most definitely recommend them for all makeup artists like myself! 💖</li>
    <li> I was excited to get them loved them but 1 prob. most of them came broken :/</li>
    <li> The brush heads are nice and firm - just like I wanted. The only drawback is the connection between the brush head and the wooden handle. It doesn&#x27;t seem all that solid.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good quality, especially for the money. Am purchasing a couple more just to have on hand.  Fantastic brush quality and easy to care for.&lt;br /&gt;Makes application so easy and the result is very smooth and quite flawless (I don&#x27;t have flawless skin...therefore I can&#x27;t use the term flawless with respect to skin texture).  Application is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE these brushes. The small hairs don&#x27;t shed out like most of the brushes I have used in the past. My only complaint is that it came with plenty eye shadow brushes that I probably won&#x27;t ever utilize. Other than that, I have no complaints. They&#x27;re pretty stylish too!</li>
    <li> reading the other reviews I guess I got lucky?? my brushes are in perfect condition and are super soft. I&#x27;m pursuing a career in makeup and these brushes do the job! I do agree the brushes have an industrial smell but it&#x27;s nothing that a spritz of brush cleaner cannot take care of. the brushes are a great size (not minis) and are very sturdy. I&#x27;ve already cleaned then about twice. overall I am very pleased with my purchase and will be back again.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! I got them the day that they were supposed to be here; I was pleasantly surprised. When I opened the amazon box, I saw the package. I was so excited. They come in this plastic baggy type and each brush is individually wrapped. The color and the actual brushes look exactly like the ones in the picture. They are beautiful, fluffy, and some are dense. The only con that I have; which is actually a big one; is that they smelled like paint thinner or to get a better picture, they smelled like spray paint. There were a lot of white dusty particles that came off of the brushes when I felt them--nasty; I just recommend washing them very very well before using. But overall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase and might consider re-purchasing soon; who knows. Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just really getting started with makeup, it would have been helpful if it came with a card of some sort describing which brushes are for what. Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> Brilliant brushes! If you don&#x27;t have hundreds to spend on brand name brushes but still want brand name level quality, these brushes are it. They are soft and easy on my sensitive skin and great for powders and gels and liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do give off a strong cleaner smell at opening so wash them before using for best results.</li>
    <li> Good brush set. They are definitely worth 11$.&lt;br /&gt;Now, they are not the most amazing brushes out there, but they do do their job.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; brushes may be big to use on the eyes, depending on your eye shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it did came in a cute pink bag. I Live all the way in the Caribbean and it came in excellent conditions&lt;br /&gt;with no damage.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. No little bristles falling! I have used them for a week already I&#x27;m impressed. I have high end brushes as well and these work just as great! Fast shipping. Will defenitely purchase more for my sisters and friends!!!</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes!! Great deal for so many brushes</li>
    <li> Happy with these brushes so far, seem like good quality, none have started to fall apart or lose bristles so that&#x27;s a good sign. soft, good sizes, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Came fast and just as pictured lovely brushes</li>
    <li> These are almoat identical to sigmas set priced MUCH higher. As a lisenced esthetican/ makeup artist. I LOVE these.&lt;br /&gt;They compare to my VERY expencive high end brushes. Theyre soft on the face and wash up nicely. I definitely would order another set.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes. Really enjoy using them for my daily make-up routine. Helped me speed up the process of getting ready. I would buy again. Would make a great gift also.</li>
    <li> Brushes were MUCH larger than expected. There&#x27;s no way I can use the &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; brushes for my eyes. The smallest one is comparable to the size of a concealer brush. Not happy -  good thing I didn&#x27;t spend any more money than I did.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! Very soft, no shedding, and no weird smells!</li>
    <li> At first I was wary of ordering these because of some negative review, but I thought,  &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not a bad price, so let&#x27;s try them.&amp;#34; I am so glad that I bought these! They are VERY soft and pick up product like a dream! The only issue I had  was that they have an extremely strong chemical smell. I washed these brushes well with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and a dot of gentle laundry detergent. I let the soap mixture settle in the bristles well before rinsing them off. They still had a faint smell, but after using them once the smell is all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Very affordable&lt;br /&gt;2. Soft brushes&lt;br /&gt;3. Picks up product well&lt;br /&gt;4. Free 2 day ship for Amazon Prime users&lt;br /&gt;5. Fit perfectly in my hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Horrible smell (before washing)&lt;br /&gt;2. The eyeshadow brushes are a bit big for my eyelids so I use them for blending or lightly dabbing on some eyeshadow (I mainly bought these brushes for the face and blush brushes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these to people who are looking for affordable and soft variety of brushes!</li>
    <li> Best value &amp; quality for the price.  Expensive brushes not necessary!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! They wash really well and don&#x27;t really shed at all. They are super soft and I don&#x27;t feel like they are soaking up my foundation when I use the blending brushes. I am really happy with these brushes and will probably be ordering more as gifts in the future!</li>
    <li> By far the BEST brushes I&#x27;ve ever used! They are so soft and easy to use. My foundation and eye makeup look flawless. Save your money on the expensive brushes and buy these. THE BEST!</li>
    <li> I was so amazed at how great these brushes are at the price I got them for! They remind me of the Sigma brushes! They are soft and make applying makeup a breeze. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice quality, however, they are not labeled, so the buyer is left guessing what the distinct uses are for each brush. There do not appear to be any brushes for lips or eyeliner. But for the price, they are nice brushes.</li>
    <li> Softest brushes ever. Really good quality.</li>
    <li> They were just okay. One of the brushes broke as soon as i tried using it on myself. They were cheap, I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Got exactly what I ordered plus a little gift! Love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter a make-up artist can&#x27;t get enough brushes, she likes these very much.</li>
    <li> Good quality and soft</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I own a lot of real technique brushes and bare mineral brushes.  These brushes are just as soft and do the job. Haven&#x27;t washed them yet so not sure how they will hold up after a few washings but a decent set for a decent price. Deff worth the $11 I paid.&lt;br /&gt;Only down side is a strong chemical odor when you open the package, but I would assume most people will wash their brushes before they use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Have washed these brushes 5-6 times now and they still hold up. No issues with the quality yet. Even if there was, they&#x27;re so cheap to replace anyways! WIN-WIN!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping &amp; awesome product!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are seriously amazing. I didn&#x27;t expect much upon ordering, just because of the price, but OH MY GOSH, they are great quality, so soft, and I had seen one brush shed upon washing, but nothing since then. They are dense, and the Kabuki flat top brush, applies my foundation so smoothly, and evenly and it doesn&#x27;t absorb my product. There is hardly any foundation on the brush after use, it is all on my face. This beats the heck out of the Urban Decay foundation brush that I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the smaller brushes to get underneath the eyes, contouring my nose, and under my lip. The flat top Kabuki is great for applying foundation, the slanted flat top kabuki is great for contouring, the more rounded out slanted brush, I use for blush, and it works great. The domed brush blends out concealer like no body&#x27;s business. I will be purchasing a few more sets of these. I think they are great if you are a freelance makeup artist. For those complaining that they weren&#x27;t labeled, or that they didn&#x27;t come with instructions, it isn&#x27;t that hard to look it up, but I had no issues, and I find them wonderful.</li>
    <li> Brushes just came in ! I was in serious need of some brushes, and i couldnt afford the high end mac or sigma brushes so i read the reviews that these are a good sigma dupe ! They so soft, they don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;cheap feel and look about like you went to Walmart and bought them,. Can&#x27;t wait to apply my make up</li>
    <li> Very good quality for an affordable price</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my grandmother for Christmas - it&#x27;s exactly what she wanted.  Very high quality brushes for a very good price.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, but mostly of the same variety.</li>
    <li> Was excited to get these brushes.... but it took 4 washes to get rid of the smell. Hairs started to shed after last cleaning.</li>
    <li> I literally ordered these brushes yesterday afternoon and they shipped the same day. I have amazon prime and they were suppose to be here tomorrow, yet they arrived TODAY !! They do have a little weird smell but nothing major, the bristles feel amazingly soft and i don&#x27;t see any shedding. Adding this to my brush collection as a makeup artist was a great move, for the price these are great quality !!</li>
    <li> Love this brushes. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I ordered and received this product a couple months ago and I am very impressed. Not only is the price very affordable, but the product is well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;High quality product&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and even application of makeup&lt;br /&gt;Very soft bristles&lt;br /&gt;Thick, sturdy handles&lt;br /&gt;Does not shed at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soooooo soft!!!!!! Like chinchilla fur soft lol. I absolutely adore them so far and the quality is unbelievable for the price. Will update review when they get a deep-cleaning but I have faith that they&#x27;ll hold up just fine.</li>
    <li> I am using my husbands account. I bought these brushes because of the great reviews and the price was so cheap! Well they are in my opinion awful!! They are to soft. The handles are loose and one of mine broke the second time I washed it! I would rather give a little extra money and get good brushes as to waste my time on these. I do not understand why so many people give such good reviews on these! They also have a strong chemical smell but after washing them it was gone. They don&#x27;t shed but that is the only really good thing I can say. I would not recommend these brushes!!</li>
    <li> worked great happy i got them!</li>
    <li> The brushes look and feel amazing! The bristles are soft and they come wrapped in a cute pink bag</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to give them to my daughters for Christmas. They are perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> Just got mine in today, fast shipping, got it in 3 days. As for the odor that most people are talking about, mine did not have any odor what&#x27;s so ever. These brushes are really soft and we&#x27;ll worth the money, I have everything from Sigma, Tom Ford, RT and these brushes easily meet my standards!!</li>
    <li> Amazing, is what I can say about these brushes. Love the soft feel of the brushes and how nice they are. Definitly worth the price and better than expected!! Can&#x27;t wait to use them tonight! Oh and very fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love  these brushes!  They look very professional and they are so soft! They apply makeup beautifully and they don&#x27;t shed like brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past!  Overall a great purchase I would recomendv these to anyone.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good for the price!</li>
    <li> Love this set so I bought an extra as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> These brushes have nothing to envy to the expensive brands Very soft, handle is a perfect size. I am very happy and I love them. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I liked this when I first purchased it but after just 2 weeks of use, the bristles have lost its firmness and shape. There is no shedding as some other brushes I have used. Sure I can return it, but what a hassle. Looking for another set to buy.</li>
    <li> I first had the E.l.f brand of makeup brushes, did not like them because every time I applied foundation with the foundation brush I would always get hairs stuck to my face, and blending the eye shadows took a lot of time. I purchased these ones in December for me and for my mother as a Christmas gift, it is very simple and quick to blend your eye shadow and when applying foundation there are no small hairs from the brush stuck to my face after applying it. My mom says she loves them too, she uses them a lot. Would definitely recommend these to anyone of my friends looking for good quality makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> ditch sigma brushes, these are exactly the same. I love the brushes so much that I think I will repurchase these as gift for my bestie....</li>
    <li> Great set! Very soft and beautiful brushes.</li>
    <li> I love it but the brushes doesn&#x27;t hold pigment very well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good I liked them so much they are very practical and just the right cellection you may need.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes! BUT, come on- what&#x27;s the big deal- why can&#x27;t you give an idea what they are used for- or at least give ideas- it&#x27;s like you just threw a bunch of brushes in a plastic bag and sent them. The bristles are nice and they wash up nice- but, it ruins it for me when you don&#x27;t go that extra step!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love! These brushes are pure heaven! I would cry if I lost one that&#x27;s how much I love these brushes. Okay it&#x27;s not that serious but I do love them. Every makeup fanatic or just anyone starting out should have these brushes. You will not regret!</li>
    <li> Love them so much . I was very pleasantly surprised that unlike other brushes that just moved powder around on a compact  these ones just picked it up which means less product waste buffs everything in nicely the only thing about this is out of the smaller brushes only about three are useful</li>
    <li> GREAT, set!!!  If you are tired of spending $30-$40 on ONE brush, this is a phenomenal set of brushes! EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS MAC BRUSHES! Theses brushes are very soft, very well made and transfer color perfectly. The brush sets selection of brushes is perfect for what you need for blending, foundation, eye make up, countering, highlighting, lips, blush, and eye liner. This is such a good deal I ordered another set for my daughter. You will LOVE these brushes!!!  Don&#x27;t pass these up, they are worth every dime!</li>
    <li> So soft, non-shedding, dense brushes. I really like them a lot.</li>
    <li> After using these brushes for a year, I am in love and they are still in great shape. Make sure you wash them first though. Here is the link to my video with the cleaning method I use: [...]</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but I just had to for these brushes. They are freaking awesome and so soft!!! They are exact dupes for the sigmas brushes too. So far they don&#x27;t shed on me nor have the tops come off like a few other reviews said. The packaging had a faint smell but I just let the brushes air out over night and they were perfect for use the next day. I will most def purchase again :)</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Works wonderful for me. Does not shed, for the priCe. These are awesome.  I would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. The weight is perfect. The hair and the way they hold makeup also perfect. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow I got these brushes for under $11 and I can&#x27;t believe the bargain! I have some Eco tools brushes that I bought at Walmart and they just don&#x27;t have the same quality as these. Definetly get more for your money here</li>
    <li> I really do like these brushes, they are pretty great, better than what I have had in the past! Definitely would recommend without hesitation!</li>
    <li> What an incredible price for more brushes then I&#x27;ll ever use! Very pleased and surprised with the high quality. Soft!</li>
    <li> They are very good. Soft and not a lot of hairs come off. I like them :)</li>
    <li> Very soft on the skin...I just love using these brushes whenever I put on my makeup. It&#x27;s very affordable too. For something so cheap this is a  steal!</li>
    <li> really good .AAA quality :D</li>
    <li> Great brush set for the price. These brushes don&#x27;t shed, which is a huge plus!</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Feel great! Great price! Love them!!!!! Blend and buff wonderfully! Did I mention the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I waited until I&#x27;ve used them for about a month with the brushes to write a review and so far I don&#x27;t have any complaints. No weird smell when they arrived and they blend my makeup very well! Absolutely love them and recommend them to all who&#x27;s searching for a kabuki set!</li>
    <li> Super happy with these brushes, my wife loved them!</li>
    <li> You get two kinds of brushes, five of each.  Even after loading them up with make-up, most of the make-up gets swooshed off into the air.  There is no shape to them.  New to make-up, I had originally thought, &amp;#34;what&#x27;s the big deal with expensive brushes?  These should be fine.&amp;#34;  Lesson learned.  In trying to save money by getting these brushes I wasted a ton of make-up.  First and last time.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.  Since they were shipped from China, the waiting was a bit long, but there&#x27;s no way around it.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and they were great for applications.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, especially for the extremely fair price. Comes in a cute little purse type container, and all brushes work perfectly. I love them, and they&#x27;re just as good as more high end brushes, in my opinion at least.</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft and great fro everyday use. The only problem I had is that the handles have broken off. I&#x27;ve used super glue to keep them on but some have still fallen off.</li>
    <li> I bought a different brand of these brushes a long time ago and love them. These were made by a different place and they work fine but one of them sheds a lot. The rest were fine but they aren&#x27;t as firm as the original set I had bought which a bit more dense. Still good brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are large, which is fine for the face brushes. For the eye brushes, the large size makes it difficult sometimes to complete detail work. The bristles are soft and fluffy, which is nice. Just be careful of the size.</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes can&#x27;t be beat. I haven&#x27;t used the Sigma ones, but from what I understand these are dupes for them and they are comparable. They are very dense and soft and they hold up for a long time. I use them for both liquid and powder products and they work great. I love them for blending foundation and the smaller ones for eyeshadow. I can&#x27;t justify paying over 20 dollars for a makeup brush when you can get ten of nearly equal quality for under 20 dollars. The only con I can find with these brushes is that the metal part sometimes comes unglued from the handle after multiple washings. I just use super glue to glue them back together and they work just fine. Would definitely recommend and repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they arrived on schedule within a week of ordering.</li>
    <li> It has a weird smell when you get it but the brushes are great</li>
    <li> very good product, i am very happy to buy it.</li>
    <li> These are great for contouring. The only reason I didn&#x27;t five star was because they do fall apart easy. You do get what you pay for when it comes to makeup.</li>
    <li> AMAZING, feel incredibly smooth and soft on your skin, and the price is unbeatable. (Washed them before using like most hygienic people, but the smell wasn&#x27;t that overwhelming in the first place, as some other reviewers have reported).</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter she LOVED  them so much. She said they were super soft good price but when she went to wash them one of her brush&#x27;s broke apart which she was mad about. Just don&#x27;t wash them so often. My daughters tip.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful and better quality than I expected for the price, very soft almost real techniq quality but with sigma brush look.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very affordable but its quality can almost match those expensive brushes. I&#x27;ve been using them for quite some time but the brushes are still okay. It makes applying makeup a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for , these are very soft and well made for the price! I have seen reviews about people losing the bristles but I have not lost any of mine, I will definitely buy these again the next time around!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They are very soft, it&#x27;s hard to believe they are synthetic. They do have a chemical smell from the paint on the handles but the smell goes away with use. I am very pleased with this purchase. I made some images to label the brushes and explain each ones use. I hope they are helpful as many reviewers where confused about which brushes do what. I will recommend these to my friends. You just can&#x27;t find a better value.</li>
    <li> Super nice brushes, especially for the price. My only issue is that they don&#x27;t label what the brushes are meant to be used for.</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes... I dont use any other ones now. thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned these brushes for about a month now and I think they are great for the price. One of the flat head brushes fell off from the handle, but it was nothing that a little hot glue couldn&#x27;t fix! The bristles are so soft on my face and distribute the products really well! Over all I&#x27;m really happy with these brushes!</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes I absolute love these. I have been using them for 2 months and haven&#x27;t given me any problems :)</li>
    <li> very good for the price, soft bristles and they dont feel super fake.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves them.  Great value for price.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when receiving these brushes because they had such good reviews and they were a great price. There were a few stray hairs but that was okay because I was so excited about how soft the brushes were. They smelled funny (like chemicals) so as a safety precaution I cleaned them with my usual brush cleaner. As I was gently drying the brushes, I noticed that they were losing a significant about of bristles. Then all at once all of the bristle fell out of the brush (this happened to three of the larger brushes). They also didn&#x27;t send the variety of brushes I was supposed to receive. I received three of the flat kabuki brushes rather than three different large brushes.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with these brushed they get the job done and are as soft as can be I will definitely be ordering more...</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Most of the face brushes worked well, but the tapered brush felt far too synthetic and didn&#x27;t pick up/ deposit product well. Most of the baby brushes did not work well for my liking. Even though this was the case, the four of the face brushes did work well, making this worth the price in my opinion. If you are looking for great prices at a great price, you might want to check out Morphe brushes. If you don&#x27;t, this is still a great deal for face brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing. In my opinion I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on more expensive brushes. The flat top kabuki brush is my favorite, it gives my foundation an airbrushed finish, and let me tell you my skin is far from perfect. The application is so great that I have stopped using my beloved beauty blender. The large tapered brush and the flat eye shadow brush are wonderful for under eye concealer. These brushes are very similar to sigma brushes! For only $11 it&#x27;s totally a steal!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  They work very well and I have not have any of the hairs fall out during my make up application - I will keep you posted....</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery, the brushes are great! Very close to MAC!</li>
    <li> It is sooo soft.more soft than my 20 dollars brushes. I bought this because its cheap and i was curious is it really that great compared to my expensive brushes? It is!! I wish i saw these before i bought my expensive brushes. It does have stinky factory smell to it but i air it out for a while and its okay.</li>
    <li> amazing brushes I used them immediately</li>
    <li> soft &amp; smooth, this value is a +</li>
    <li> Awesome brush set. I bought it for my daughter but after seeing it, I&#x27;m going to order another set for me.</li>
    <li> Overall a great deal! These brushes are amazing !</li>
    <li> Great brushes, they are soft, mild shedding, but great applicators for foundation.</li>
    <li> A few broke the first time I used them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brshes, very affordable. Love the soft feel to them, overall very good buy.</li>
    <li> They are ok. The handle broke off immediately on 2 of the brushes. I Imagine more will break as I continue to use them. They smell weird out of the packaging so I washed them (I prob. would do that regardless). You really get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchased, this time as a gift. They are great brushes!</li>
    <li> love them! work well for blending</li>
    <li> Oh these brushes are amazing !</li>
    <li> Really great brushes they&#x27;re super soft and are gorgeous but they shed a lot, i took off the packaging and two already had some sticking out and shedding, but definitely worth the buy</li>
    <li> These brushes are exactly what I needed. They are soft and does the job well.</li>
    <li> They smell really bad! I was going to return them but I had forgotten. Good price though but now I have to wash the brushed before use and maybe spray like perfume on them. Yecchh.</li>
    <li> Really quality brushes. Use everyday for my makeup. Only thing I don&#x27;t like it there is not very much variety within the eye makeup brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are good, but honestly, I thought they could be a little better. If you are just starting getting into makeup, then yes, I&#x27;m all for buying these. If you are experienced in makeup, then you might find that the face brushes aren&#x27;t quite dense enough to get the job done flawlessly. Yes though, you have to consider the price. My buffing brush looks angled, and isn&#x27;t quite dense enough to apply foundation smoothly. I don&#x27;t know if I was sent two angled brushes my accident??? There are hit and misses in this set, but I would pay the $12 dollars purely for the hits. For one, all the eye shadow brushes are a definite hit! Omg, the blending brushes give me life. The angled one (the one that I think is supposed to be angled) is perfect for bronzer. Also, the flatter top angled brush is great for blending out the bronzer. My only problem is with 3 brushes, the buffing, flat top, and pointed one. To me they&#x27;re not quite dense enough to get the job done. But those were the only misses in my opinion. Other than that, this set is really, really, good. 7/10 brushes are quite lovely, and that&#x27;s great for only $12!!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes very soft and easy to clean</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with these brushes. They&#x27;re very similar to IT cosmetic brushes and the BH cosmetic Brushes too. Very soft, little fall out, GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!! They are amazing!</li>
    <li> These are good brushes. They are super soft. Yes, the handles come off but you can fix it with glue. No big deal!</li>
    <li> So happy with my purchase. Took a couple weeks for delivery but was worth the wait. They are so soft.I use them for foundation concealer etc. And they make my makeup look flawless</li>
    <li> Absolutely,love the brushes. Such great quality for an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Like it ... it&#x27;s soft !!! Thanks</li>
    <li> These brushes were great.. until I cleaned them. Then they started to shed. At first it wasn&#x27;t so bad, but the more I used them the more hairs came out! I do not want little hairs all over my face when I&#x27;m putting my makeup on!</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes for an excellent price.  If there weren&#x27;t so many of them I would have ordered them again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I bough this for my wife.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Great with fantastic quality. Only issue I had was the smell you first open them, it smells like paint, but I contacted the email on the card you receive with them and she said to use soap and water on a rag and it goes away! Other than that they are great. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase expensive brushes anymore, these give just a great results for more than half the price! Definitely will reorder again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I personally don&#x27;t see how some people aren&#x27;t getting product on their brushes. I get LOADS of it on mine. The flat kabuki buffs out smoothly, and my face has a flawless finish. Some of these reviews sound fake to me, someone got a bad batch, or someone is telling them to lie. Either way, I love them! I would recommend over sigma anyday.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are really soft and blend my make up beautifully. Also very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Packaged poorly.. No explanation of brush use. Brush handle immediately fell off the brush. I would not recommend this brush set. I will be sending back for full refund.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  These brushes are so soft and barely hold any color.  Garbage quality.  NO WHERE NEAR professional quality brushes like Sigma or Mac.</li>
    <li> They smelled like paint when I got them out of packaging. Otherwise great brushes</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes for a few months and i am absolutely in love! I am a pro makeup artist and the quality is amazing!!  highly recommend them for everyone! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes! The only problem is the glue that holds the gold and the black on a few of my brushes. Otherwise they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> Amazing when used of face, easy cleaning. Loved it!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best. They arrived within  a few days. Great quality, love them!</li>
    <li> Omg! So worth it, I love these brushes</li>
    <li> Very good quality. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! Shipped super fast and brushes and soft and easy to blend with!!!!</li>
    <li> Was not satisfied with the product.  Bristles of brushes fall out!</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes today and I must say most of them look great! My only complaint is the flat top and the angle flat top kabuki brushes are less dense than I thought and it&#x27;s shedding quite a bit but I think its because it was the way it wrapped.</li>
    <li> These were a gift. My daughter is very pleased.</li>
    <li> These brushes really well. I will never buy the more expensive brushes again.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! I have used them every single day since I got them. It was such a night surprise that the brushed have some &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to them so they don&#x27;t feel cheap even though you&#x27;re getting a great deal. The gold finish looks really great on them too. The thing I like the most is that the brushes are very soft to the touch. This was great because it is always so hard to commit to brushes when you can&#x27;t feel them in person. Great Buy!</li>
    <li> I love my makeup as much as the next person. But when travel I hate having to use take my \\&quot;Good\\&quot; facial brushes with me. I found this set on Amazon.com and for the price I figured I would try it out, the worst thing that could happen is I would wast my money. I purchased the black set for traveling but I think i will be purchasing a second set to use. Mainly to have different brushes for different textures and form of foundation and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-The brushes arrived within 3 days of ordering them - I am highly pleased with the delivery/service of the seller.&lt;br /&gt;-The brushes DID NOT have a funny plastic smell (since they came wrapped that way)&lt;br /&gt;-The brushes DO NOT shed onto your face with the product being used (mouse, liquid, spray or any type of foundation/concealer)&lt;br /&gt;-The brushes are dense and DO NOT absorb all the product that your using.&lt;br /&gt;-They are very easy to clean the product off after using.&lt;br /&gt;  (I do always recommend to clean your foundation/concealer burshes weekly-HOWEVER I am not an expert just germa-phobic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I have NOT experienced any issues with these brushes and have been using them for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS PLEASE ASK. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANYTHING *****</li>
    <li> The quality for the price is 5 stars. That being said, there are some loose hairs on like 2 of the 10 brushes but none of the handles are glued very well. Easy fix though!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic set of brushes, and the price is unbelievable! They are well-made and everything that I would expect from top of the line make up brushes, so why pay more? I recommend these 100%.</li>
    <li> Changed my life. So soft but holds makeup well!!! I have washed twice now and no fall out. GREAT GREAT GREAT</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, great quality. I would definitely buy again! Professional grade for a VERY reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very soft. Works great. Recommend. Def happy and satisfied with product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These are very good my only worry that I had is that they wouldn&#x27;t show up but they did! And they do have a smell that&#x27;s kind of like a weird paint but it goes away in about a day. But I wanted a dense brush and I was worried these wouldn&#x27;t be but they are so if you don&#x27;t want a dense brush then they probably aren&#x27;t for you but anyways for me I love them!!</li>
    <li> They do have a smell when you first get them but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.  Super soft and so many different brush angles come with this set! Well worth it I would probably have paid triple for them !</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves these!</li>
    <li> Fantastic brushes for the cost! I would purchase these brushes again. Good quality. They don&#x27;t lose any bristles, which was a huge concern of mine. You also get a lot of brushes which is really nice. Great product!! Buy them today!</li>
    <li> they are super durable and super soft! they have nice handles and are really great brushes. i love them!! highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> These are so soft, affordable, and are well worth it!</li>
    <li> Fairly decent especially for the price!</li>
    <li> covers the basics, excellent price! Not super dense like those that cost $30 a piece, but it feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> First set of brushes I&#x27;ve owned so far so good, you do get what you pay for so they do have that made in China feel/look but they&#x27;re greay for what I want them for.</li>
    <li> I just love these brushes...make applying your makeup effortlessly...I ordered one set and loved then so much that I reordered two more sets</li>
    <li> Thanks so much .. I received them when it said i would.!! I&#x27;m super excited they feel so soft &amp; for 7$ you can&#x27;t beat the amazing quality!!</li>
    <li> super soft, brushes come in all different shapes and sizes for different uses.</li>
    <li> love it but the chemicals smell very strong.</li>
    <li> Love them.  Good quality and work well.</li>
    <li> Even better quality then I thought they would be. Soft, and full bodied brushes that passed my tests. Definitely worth the purchase price. I love them so much I&#x27;m going to be getting another set!</li>
    <li> Love the large brushes</li>
    <li> While the brush part seems to be of good quality they are pretty hard to clean even with professional cleaner. And almost all of the big brushes has separated from the handles. :(</li>
    <li> Really soft brushes. I will say that it doesn&#x27;t not come with the small angled brush used for filling in eyebrows and eyeliner, nor the small flat brush. They seemed to replaced it with another eyeshadow brush and a small contouring brush. Which totally fine by me. I needed more eyeshadow brushes anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m updating my review because I just washed them for the first time and half the brushes were shedding on me:( I was so happy using them (I know nasty of me to use them before washing them as soon as I got them). Some of them didn&#x27;t shed but most of them did. I have purchased a lot if similar brushes on here. I do believe they are somewhat inconsistent with their product. Some people get really great ones and some get really bad ones. Oh well. Good thing they aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> Loved these! They did have a chemical smell when they arrived. A simple cleaning, spritzing of alcohol, and air dry and these were ready for use (I do this will all new brushes). The tools matter and these have made makeup application a great deal easier for me at half (or more) of the price. They&#x27;ve already replaced some of my more expensive brushes. They are very soft and help me to blend better than I was doing before. Some of the brushes I use more than others as with all brush sets. Well worth purchase!</li>
    <li> Okay so, when I got my brushes (before I opened/used them) I was so nervous because of the price. But, after I opened them &amp; used them I was BEYOND surprised! Some of my high end brushes don&#x27;t work as well as these. I did a full face with them and washed (they had a strong scent) and they worked beautifully and the smell went away! I highly recommend, especially for beginners. Thank you so so so much!</li>
    <li> These brushes are so amazing! They are just like the bh cosmetics pack of brushes except cheaper and totally worth buying. They did have a smell to them, but that isn&#x27;t really a problem for me. They work amazingly and I am happy with how the apply product to my face. I definitely recommend getting these brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d probably give this 3.5 stars, if I could. The brushes are a little stiff, and as a few other reviews said, the handle comes off pretty easily. Not a difficult fix, super glue does the trick.</li>
    <li> I think the price for this set is reasonable and delivered as guaranteed!</li>
    <li> They arrived 2 days after ordering with Amazon prime. When I got them I immediately opened the bag to check them out. I checked every single brush for shedding, smell, and to ensure the brush head was properly attached to the handle. I was surprised to find zero shedding and they are all strongly attached to the brush head. The do smell a little strong (chemical smell typical of synthetic materials) but I will wash them tonight and I am positive the smell will go away. They are super soft and I really like the big face brushes; not as dense as the MAC or Sigma kabuki but close enough. You really won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference and the product will go on your face just the same. I am pleasantly surprised with this set and will recommend it to my friends who don&#x27;t want to shed over $100.00 on a brush set like I did (Sigma Essential Kit for $170.00 anyone?)</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they are so soft and do not shed</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast. Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Very impressed. Brushes are soft and feel good with my sensitive skin. Not put together too well, but not surprised with how cheap they were. You get what you pay for. I decided to glue the brushes together after washing them as one reviewer suggested and they work great. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I would love to give them 5 stars only because they arrive the very next day. I didnt expect them to be delivered that fast. The brushes are good quality for the price. They do have a strong smell, but it went away as soon as i opened them.</li>
    <li> Im not a professional makeup artist so these brushes definitely do the job for me! They are soft and give a good application every time. Best of all? I&#x27;m not seeing any hairs on my face after using them!!</li>
    <li> Half of the handles broke off in the first use! But it does come with so many, I had back up!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft therefore it takes more time buffing and blending into the skin with mineral makeup. They are ok for the price to use at home but not professional....not even as a backup.</li>
    <li> The best brushes ever for this price  don&#x27;t have no problems brushes were great Plus super soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for over a month now and I think they are awesome!</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and sturdy. Great sizes. I love them</li>
    <li> Some of the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent. Brushes are super soft, good variation in the types of brushes, and makeup goes on so smoothly!! Good for building makeup, which leaves a natural finish --  instead of splotching a whole bunch on your face at once that sometimes leaves you looking like a clown. Love it! There is a strong spray paint smell at first but a quick rinse with Dawn soap and it was fine.</li>
    <li> shipping was on time, the brushes are soft</li>
    <li> Great brushes. I only had a few and absolutely needed more as I wanted to learn more about makeup. They are very soft and there are so many it&#x27;s crazy. Great buy for the price. Soft Soft Soft brushes.</li>
    <li> My daughter had confiscated my brushes and since she is so enamored with make up, thought this would be a welcome addition to her collection. It was.</li>
    <li> So exited to receive them, but once I got them I was so disappointed they were shedding REALLY bad couldn&#x27;t even use some of them</li>
    <li> They do have a chemical smell but after washing them it gets better every time. They are way softer than I expected them to be for the price. Overall a really good buy!</li>
    <li> Really good brushes, but I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star because the brushes broke apart and I had to super glue them back together.</li>
    <li> I would give it no stars if I could.  In less than 2 months the handles have come off the brushes I use daily.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved these brushes and a great price, she ended up taking back one brush for 24 dollars when I got her this great deal.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re soft. Not as soft as you wold first think soft would be. I don&#x27;t LOVE them... but they are pretty nice for the price, although they&#x27;re technically $17 including shipping and you could get Real Techniques brushes with that but still it&#x27;s a nice collection saying how many brushes there are. Yeah I like them!</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes. Could use a description for what each brush is used for.</li>
    <li> second time buying the first time loved them this time they shed a lot!  and when i say a lot i mean a lot!</li>
    <li> the brushes smell like paint thinner.&lt;br /&gt;I will be sending them back</li>
    <li> Very soft and sturdy. I love them :)</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!! They came super fast in the mail. The brushes have a weird smell when you first open them, but go away after a few washes. None of the hairs where falling out, which if good for their price. Super soft for synthetic brushes. Over all great brushes for a great price.</li>
    <li> soft well made --great brushes</li>
    <li> I love the quality  on these brushes. Apply my makeup was very easy and smooth. I will recommend  these brushes and not expensive. I made a good choice.</li>
    <li> so soft! but they kinda smell..maybe because they are new. anyway, i am very excited to use them.</li>
    <li> I tried these out for the first time this week. These brushes are great for the price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! They did come with a little smell, but after washing them it was practically gone.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice to get a card that explained what some of the brushes are for, but overall, I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> These are the nicest brushes for the price! Very functional and soft!</li>
    <li> I thought that is was a better quality of makeup brushes, when I received them I thought they were pretty, but then I uses them and 1 of them are broken, and they are not sturdy enough, about to break another 1 now... So I will have to go out and purchase more even tho I just brought those.. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Nothing i can say is enough for these brushes with how reasonable the price is. They are GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent, my daughter loves these brushes.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes came broken, but nothing a little super glue won&#x27;t fix. Other than that they&#x27;re pretty good brushes.</li>
    <li> Cons: hairs fall out, even the smallest isn&#x27;t small enough for precision application.  Basically two sizes. big and small, very little variation in brushes.  Don&#x27;t hold makeup well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: a lot of brushes for a decent price and they seem to work fine</li>
    <li> These brushes are so nice.  Love them!  They don&#x27;t loose the hair in them at all!</li>
    <li> These are great brushes! Made well and the price is perfect!  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> They are decent for $14 brushes but I really can&#x27;t use them much. They just don&#x27;t apply makeup in the way I need my brushes to. They are great for quick applications with little to no blending but if you&#x27;re looking for good eye shadow brushes, move on. They lose more makeup than they apply and really, I can only use it for one MAYBE two shades. These are perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t spend much time blending shades or contouring.</li>
    <li> I really like this set of brushes. On any given day I use 3 of them. I only had a shedding issue with one of the brushes so I just didn&#x27;t use that one. The rest of them are super soft and have helped me step up my make up game.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to all the users out there. Very much needed and absolutely workss!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with my purchase and am definitely going to buy another set! Well worth the money paid.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchace i was hesitant at first cause i didnt want to waste my money,but i did it anyway cause of the price. I recived these brushes less than a week. These brushes are so soft i enjoyed putting on my make up with them they work really good. i would buy these brushes again.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes as soon as I got them I started playing with them they&#x27;re an amazing quality for the price. I was honestly shocked on how smoothly these brushes applied my make up. my favorites are blending brushes they literally make it so easy to blend my shadow &amp; I don&#x27;t have to spend a long time swirling my brush around my eye to get all the harsh lines out it just makes it so effortless &amp; simple. I&#x27;m never buying high end brushes again. the only reason it didn&#x27;t give these babies a full 5 star rating is cause my set didn&#x27;t come with the dome shaped brush, instead I have three round brushes &amp; the two flat top. (face brushes, the shadow brushes were complete) other than that I highly recommend purchasing these brushes they&#x27;re so soft &amp; the price is right. I&#x27;m going to order two more sets for my sisters I think everybody should have these lol</li>
    <li> Love it !! Went to by another one</li>
    <li> I honestly love these brushes, they apply product like a dream. they give a beautiful finish. the only thing is the shipping not to bad but a little over priced.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes, very soft.  The price is unbelievable considering the number of brushes in the set.  I like the wooden handles.  There was a nice Thank You note included from BS Mall.  Delivery was in accordance with Prime membership.  A good purchase!</li>
    <li> they are just what I expected!!  they are very similar to the BH Cosmetics brushes !! they are amazing !!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping love the Brushes very soft blends well will order again</li>
    <li> Very soft on skin.  Great blending and buffs into skin very well.</li>
    <li> These are good quality brushes. I only wish on of the larger ones was even bigger for powdered foundation. Thank you.</li>
    <li> They are pretty good brushes for the price. I would and have recommended. and for my its better than no brushes at all :)</li>
    <li> For the price these are great.  Some of the bristles do come out but it isn&#x27;t a lot.  They are so soft and work so nicely.  I don&#x27;t understand the people complaining on here...It&#x27;s $11 bucks.  They work great for the price!  They aren&#x27;t perfect, but can&#x27;t expect that for the price.  Either way GREAT BUY--especially for those just learning to do their make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!!  --&amp;#62;  I have been doing my make up for years without the proper brushes.  I finally ordered these to try it out with &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; ones, and wow!!! seriously amazing!!  My eyes look like someone professional did them!!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at what good quality these are! Very happy.</li>
    <li> Really loved these brushes work great</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes and let me tell you, they make your makeup go on like butter. They are so soft and versatile. I recommend these brushes for any makeup lover and professional artists.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes for my makeup. They work so well on my face with my foundation. I highly recommend you buy these wonderful brushes.</li>
    <li> Decent, gets the job done. Unfortunately they were falling apart by the time I got them. I had to super glue the tops and bottoms back together.</li>
    <li> The brushes are ok, I won&#x27;t say the best. I read reviews before I ordered the brush and I thought ok the price is really good and read good reviews so why not try it. I was happy when the delivery came in i opened the box and found one broken brush. I was upset but hey I got 9 more. The eye shadow brushes wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, it was very thin. The foundation brush didn&#x27;t give me that nice blend when I used it. And some of the brushes hair falls off. But they are soft.i just didn&#x27;t like how it didn&#x27;t give me that nice finishing. Just to let you know there aren&#x27;t enough hair on the brush.</li>
    <li> nice set but have some super glue handy because the handle came lose from where the gold and black come together but the brushes are great</li>
    <li> Ok, YES, the smell is there, but it doesn&#x27;t linger long after the first wash. Ladies, these brushes are so SOFT. Forget the smell, they are really great.</li>
    <li> well I bought these brushes about two months ago. I&#x27;ve only used them a few times (as I only put on my bareminerals on special occasions) well I was cleaning off a brush and the end came right off! The metal part I&#x27;d flimsy and horrible. The smell they had was awful I couldn&#x27;t even get rid of it with brush cleaner. These are cheap and they won&#x27;t last long! Take it from me (who only used these three times before the broke apart) not worth it, spend a little for for the good ones these suck!</li>
    <li> My Brushes Came Completely Broken.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! its so soft and its perfect!</li>
    <li> I like them but don&#x27;t use on oily skin or it will start to streak your make up unless you keep brushes clean</li>
    <li> The brushes look great..&lt;br /&gt;I used two so far..&lt;br /&gt;I only con would be u wished they came with each brushed used for applications..</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft! They are amazing! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed that they gave me two of the same brushes. but all in all, I like them and they&#x27;re good enough quality. The brushes turned out to be fatter than I thought. ah well..</li>
    <li> Great and fast shipping ! I absolutely love these brushes 😻 the bristles are great</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t last very long if washed often but what brush does?? The best brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> I am in love with these brushes! I have several different foundation brushes but nothing works as well as these.  When I first got them the smell was awful but I left them out over night and haven&#x27;t smelled anything since.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t as good as what the reviews said. Im pretty dissapointed. The bristles start to stick out after 4 uses. Well for me. I dont know i may of gotten bad ones but i don&#x27;t like them very much. The application is quit streaky when i put on foundation with the round brush and also the head of one of the brushes came off of the handle so now its pretty much useless.</li>
    <li> Brushes are so soft and no fall out of hairs just like high end brushes but a lot less in price will def recommend purchasing</li>
    <li> Love love the quality. ..don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it does have a plastic smell to the brushes  but once cleaned and washed no smell left...also no shedding I will definitely order a new set...what could be helpful is like labels or list of what the brush is used for.</li>
    <li> Kind of cheap looking. Still need to try them though.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re OK...at this price I really can&#x27;t complain.  Bigger brushes are much better then smaller ones</li>
    <li> First off, I LOVE makeup and my makeup brush collection is out of control. I have TONS of brushes, but I&#x27;m always looking to try new things. After using these, I was very impressed. I still can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive these brushes were. I assumed the quality was going to be very poor even though a majority of the reviews were positive. These have become my every day makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no shedding, the apply the product beautifully, and they are easy to clean. With them being synthetic, they are perfect to use when using liquid or cream products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about using makeup brushes when you haven&#x27;t in the past, I would definitely give these a try. They are inexpensive and I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. Comparable to my Sigma and Real Techniques brushes, but you really can&#x27;t beat the price of this 10-piece set!</li>
    <li> I absolutley love these brushes. I definely a believer of not having to spend a boat-load in order to have nice things and these brushes are just that. They blend my makeup really well and are easy to clean ( I use baby soap on my makeup brushes).</li>
    <li> when you go to clean the brushes, the handle detaches</li>
    <li> Quality brushes for a great price!</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZINGG, they are super soft they honestly feel like the professionals brushes and act the same as well. They don&#x27;t shed AT ALL! They work really well and honestly the brushes can serve for multiple purposes which is a plus as well. I really recommend buying these brushes hands down the best make up brushes i&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> These brushes work so well.  I have actually purchased 2 sets of these because I like them so much.  You can&#x27;t beat the price!  I have washed them several times now and they haven&#x27;t shed and they have kept their shape very well.  When you first open them they do have a bit of a smell to them.  I just let them air out and then wash them and the smell completely disappears.</li>
    <li> I got them today &amp;#60;3 and I seriously love them .</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought these brushes for me as an early valentine&#x27;s day present after hearing me complain about needing new kabuki brushes. They came in the mail today, and i fell in love with them upon opening them. I absolutely love the gold color, and the brushes themselves felt amazing. The bristles are very soft, hold product well, and apply makeup perfectly, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was the strong factory, paint like smell when i first opened the plastic. No big desl though - all cosmetic products i order from amazon seem to have that smell. It didn&#x27;t last ling, by the way. . . After their first wash, they smelled fine.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to throw in that the brushes kept their shape after being washed.</li>
    <li> In the past I have spent money on Mac brushes and decided to opt for a cheaper option by buying these brushes. I HAVENO REGRETS!!!!! These are the best brushes I have ever used by far. They apply makeup evenly and work well to help conceal my blemishes (acne scars). I recommend them 100 %. The only downside to these brushes is that they can become loose. I bought them knowing that because I read previous reviews on it. One customer has included great details on how the fix the looseness and that has solved that problem for me. Despite that, it is worth the purchase. Will purchase again, if necessary.</li>
    <li> I never expected for these brushes to be such great quality. I&#x27;m an avide makeup artist and I&#x27;m impressed. They are great. Ill be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes so much and they were shipped right away. The brushes are so soft and worth the price of it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, the are really soft and give you flawless finish</li>
    <li> Smells strongly of chemicals and the hairs started coming off from the first use.</li>
    <li> Love how soft they are , and they are cheap work like sephora&#x27;s brushes or better. ❤</li>
    <li> They are pretty good brushes so far. Very dense and a little smaller than I thought they would be, but they work fine. Just needed a couple cheaper brushes to work with for the meantime.</li>
    <li> Brushes looked great but the handle fell off 2 of them the 2nd time using them.  I&#x27;d return them if I still had the box and return address</li>
    <li> Now I haven&#x27;t even actually been able to use these yet. And I highly doubt I even will. Yeah these brushes are great for the price everything I expected them to be blah blah blah. But the smell! Can we talk about the smell. As soon as I opened my mail box a cloud that smelled like rancid house paint filled my nose. But as always I rushed inside with my excitement for anything to do with new makeup brushes ect. When coming to open the package I found my brushes completely wrapped in a bundle of packaging tape. Which smelled like methane and paint. I can&#x27;t express how badly these smelled. Felt great and soft but I couldn&#x27;t even pull the brushes up to face. I have washed my brushes 4-5 times now even went to the extreme to buy expensive brush cleaner which infact did NOTHING. I have tried literally everything but my brushes continue to smell like they were used to paint a house. Now I don&#x27;t know about you but there&#x27;s no way in hell I&#x27;m rubbing these smelly brushes on my face. So I will probably just throw them out. And that is literally my only issue with these brushes. And a huge one in fact. I pay close attention to reviews. It seems like half are having my problem and half are having no issues at all. So yeah I would recommend these brushes because they are exactly like the set from bhcosmetics. But do yourself a favor pay a little extra and avoid the risk of paint brushes and order from their actual website.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes for price but have a weird odor.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit. The different brushes really help control where eyeshadow is going. They do not seem to shed hairs, which I really appreciate, since often I can not see them unless I put glasses on. In the picture, the brush at the far right has been perfect for filling in the outer corners of upper lids, and for lightly but precisely emphasizing brows.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with my brushes!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality brushes. I use them everyday.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for weeks and they are still losing hairs. I thinking is just how they are made, but it is annoying to keep picking little bristles off my face.</li>
    <li> Love the quality and softness off brush set. Very affordable and received them quickly</li>
    <li> This brush are my holy grail they are worth the price</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting! Great quality brushes!</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast but the best part, these are good brushes. Though synthetic they were soft, and full..... I will order another set.</li>
    <li> Just received order today shipping was extremely fast came within 4days. I haven&#x27;t tried the brushes out yet, they&#x27;re soft but looks a lil cheap. But I guess u get what u pay for considering this purchase was inexpensive. Also  there is a light oder almost like paint or something. Only thing I wish it came with details for use of the brushes, which it does not. I understand there&#x27;s details online but I shouldn&#x27;t have to reference the site for info every time before use.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, lots of them in perfect sizes for a great price. If you told me these were $50 brushes I would believe it without a doubt, a must have.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes - very soft. Not as much variety as i expected ! But overall, good product for general makeup application.</li>
    <li> They feel amazing, kinda like real techniques brushes.</li>
    <li> these brushes are soft and seem like they would work well but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that they hairs are not tight around the barrel which may allow water to enter and stay in there and possibly cause problems with the brushes</li>
    <li> Great quality, wife loves them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! They are very soft and durable. They do not shed, which is a plus. I&#x27;ve had them since December and are still in great shape.</li>
    <li> Great brushes once you get past order evaporation</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON SIGMA BRUSHES! I was incredibly skeptical of the making this purchase but it was totally worth it! You get a variety of brushes for less than half of what you pay for any sigma brush!</li>
    <li> Terrible. The big brushes bristles are too short and basically the same</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing they got here quicker than i thought they&#x27;re super soft love the color way matte black and gold perfect match definitely will purchase again</li>
    <li> Is ok...I&#x27;m just not sure if they really works whit ur products good...I apply and apply foundation or whatever and not much stay in place..</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes also with 12 elf brushes &amp; primer and also a makeup organizer . The Brushes are nice and soft my only problem is the smell 😩 the smell like paint and glue and it&#x27;s a strong smell but hopefully once I wash them the smell will go away. Shipping was faster than expected. And I didn&#x27;t know what brushes were for what until I looked on Bh cosmetics so that helped a lot</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and work well with any makeup application. I just wish they added one size smaller brush for underlining lower lashes.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush set! I almost can&#x27;t believe it! I will probably buy a second one they are very soft, really durable feeling except one which i&#x27;ll glue together, nice and thick and stiff for blending. They smell very strong but I washed them and they&#x27;re perfect now :) what a steal!!!</li>
    <li> Two of the brushes have already broken and the rest are becoming loose.</li>
    <li> These brushes are pretty awesome for the price.  I was using a combination of anything from elf studio brushes to estee lauder and higher end brushes that have just accumulated over the years in my collection.  I purchased these because I wanted a decent SET of brushes that would look nice on my counter and do their job all in one shot, and these are perfect.  Simple and sleek looking, which is nice, and they perform fantastically for the price (about a dollar a brush!  like whaaaat..) ... I do have to say they DID smell when I received them, but don&#x27;t let that turn you off.  just wash them with your facial cleanser and disinfect with some alcohol solution...  and if you need to know the names of which brushes, check out these nearly identical sets from BH and Sigma:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.bhcosmetics.com/products/10-pcs-sculpt-and-blend-brush-set&lt;br /&gt;http://www.sigmabeauty.com/Sigmax_Essential_Kit_10_Brushes_p/smax08.htm</li>
    <li> Love them so much so soft amazing quality for this price!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product very soft makeup goes on well but if you wash your brushes for quite some time the handle will break but I glued my back and it was like new</li>
    <li> Soft, full, elegant brushes.  These were a gift for my college-age daughter, so I was just able to check these out.  They are well put together, super-soft and she has had no shedding.  I&#x27;m considering purchasing one for myself and my mom.  They were a great gift!</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s true, they come with a very strong smell of paint, but other than that they are great quality brushes. The smell eventually goes away so no worries.</li>
    <li> They arrived packaged well and on time. They had a slight smell to them so I just unpackaged them and sat them by an open window for a little and no more smell. They work great with distributing my makeup. Loved how they felt on my skin, not rough at all. I would say they should either label the brushes or put a card in their to say which brush is for what but other than that I recommend these brushes. And another plus is that they aren&#x27;t too expensive and still great quality.</li>
    <li> I like these, I use most of them. They don&#x27;t shed and sere the purpose. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast. I was shocked, they came before they were expected. They are very soft and fluffy (: Can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
    <li> These brushes were amazing. For someone who uses makeup every time she goes anywhere these are the way to go. They are super soft and you do not feel like you are running your face by rubbing forever getting everything to go on and be even the brush finishes the job fast. Easy to clean and come in so many different sizes that it is perfect for someone who likes to do eye-shadow and things along those lines. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Nope. Just like all other inexpensive brushes. The hairs fall out constantly and are either far too tightly packed or too loose. Either way, they do not administer almost any powder to the face.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  they are a good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes for the price!&lt;br /&gt;They do the work and it makes your makeup blend smoothly. I don&#x27;t think you can beat the quality and the price at once.</li>
    <li> easy to clean, good quality</li>
    <li> Great brushes🙆&lt;br /&gt;I love the powder brush and foundation brush the most.&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because It had strong chemical smell when I first got it but after I rinse it and let it dry, the smell was gone in the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> Very nice to the touch,</li>
    <li> I bought 4 sets, 1 for me and 3 as gifts and yes they are amazing brushes! I use it everyday and it picks up makeup well and blends spectacularly. Everyone love them and for the price, that&#x27;s just the cherry on top. I highly recommend these brushes, but just with any  new makeup brushes; wash before you use :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are GREAT, work great with anastasia contour kit its just love at first sight 😍</li>
    <li> Works really well! Only 4 stars becuase when I purchased the product, it smelled like toxic paint. MUST wash before first use! Otherwise, super soft and brushes makeup on evenly. A steal for the price!</li>
    <li> They came in today and I gave them a try and they are a great product I just wish that their eye brushes are different  I received three brushes that are the same but over all they are GREAT BRUSHES for make up 👍</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality No Shedding</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so inlove with my brushes! There extremely soft! The shipping was supper fast also !</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brushes, they are so soft! Recommended:)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these brushes too much but the few times I used the small brushes for eyeshadow they worked like a charm. I had a sephora brush set I got some time ago but these brushes seemed way softer and applied makeup better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for people complaining about the smell, just carefully wash them. I didn&#x27;t use mine after a couple of days after I received them and the smell pretty much went away on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had some veeery few fly-away bristles or some were a bit larger then the rest of the brush. All I had to do was to cut them carefully. They are pretty good brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!</li>
    <li> so far so good I&#x27;ve had them for about a little over a month haven&#x27;t had any problems yet I still have to see how they react once I wash them. when i received them one of the smaller brushes the head of the brush was crooked on the handle but no big deal it didn&#x27;t break off or anything.</li>
    <li> My wife thought it was a great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I was really shocked when they came because it was way before the predicted time but they are as soft as said. I really love them. They were all inside a plastic wrap bag thing to keep them in tact so overall I had a great experience.</li>
    <li> BRUSHES COME APART PRETTY QUICKLY</li>
    <li> The brushes feel great. They&#x27;re smooth and they&#x27;re amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are pretty amazing. I mainly bought them because the flat brush looked like many of the stippling brushes I have seen. I use it for my foundation and it&#x27;s awesome. I use a full coverage foundation and I thought it would get absorbed into the brush and not cover as much as when I use my fingers. But it applies it flawlessly and it covers imperfections. I love these brushes and I totally recommend them. The brushes are pretty thick not super thin and cheap like other brushes sold for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;The slanted one helps me contour perfectly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very well made, they are soft but not too soft - just the right texture. They look much more expensive than they are and I have not encountered any shedding as of yet. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes make up goes on smooth and no shedding !</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes! Defiantly worth the price! The only con is they smell like paint but you can wash them and they will be fine!</li>
    <li> Exc quality, fast ship, great seller, will recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M ALL ABOUT THESE BRUSHES!!! I use them almost everyday, my makeup looks amazing, everyone noticed that my makeup looks so much better now, even my boyfriend asked me if I was using my new brushes because I looked better than ever (and of course I&#x27;m using them yaass)!! Fast shipping. They&#x27;re super soft, they don&#x27;t have a weird smell, they were intact (they still are), they&#x27;re beautiful, they&#x27;re great overall, I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Very soft makeup brush set, I really like it!</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> Im about to buy this again for a friend.  brushes are so soft.  A bargain  but a good bargain...</li>
    <li> Got for my Mum, she loves the brushes!</li>
    <li> Good price and works well. The only issue is the SMELL!!  Good grief it&#x27;s strong but after washing in soapy water the scent dies down and eventually disappears.</li>
    <li> Great value.  They feel like the more expensive ones.  I washed them before use and there was no shedding, no bad odors and they dried fast.</li>
    <li> All the handles fell off as I opened them. The glue apparently doesn&#x27;t hold.  I hot glued them back together and they&#x27;re ok now. Cheap as heck. Work ok.... would spend $20 more and get something of quality. Cheap is Cheap for a reason.</li>
    <li> When I received these makeup brushes, they were all packaged together in a plastic bag. Each brush was inside of it’s own light weight plastic sleeve/wrap. I did not find these plastic sleeves to be suitable for long-term use or storage of these brushes and have found another method of storing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date, I have currently tried 5 out of the 10 brushes. I designated one for liquid foundation, one for loose powder, two for blushes, and one for concealer (smaller brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, these brushes seem to be an excellent value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger (Kabuki style) brushes are VERY soft and easy to work with. I was very impressed with the quality of the them. They pick up product very well, apply product smoothly and work great for blending. The handles are a great length and thickness to feel comfortable in my hand while applying makeup. I feel that this kit is worth the price just for these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller brushes are still quite soft, but not as soft as the larger brushes in this kit. They seem to be too small to apply my foundations and blushes, but too large to apply my eye shadows. The only use I have found for them so far is for my concealers (they do an okay job with applying concealers), although they may be good for contouring (and I plan to experiment with that at a later date). Currently I am not using these smaller brushes much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In total, the 5 brushes have shed maybe 2 hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase these brushes again for this price and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a less-expensive option to Kabuki style makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Was delivered fast and on time. I just didn&#x27;t like the quality of the brush&#x27;s bristols. I like mine a little more dense then these were, but great quality overall.</li>
    <li> Its smooth but kinda has some strong chemical spell</li>
    <li> My brushes have an awful smell... Like moth balls or old bananas</li>
    <li> nice and soft, I would recommend</li>
    <li> Good brushes wish it came with a bag or holder.</li>
    <li> After receiving these, they sat in their plastic package on my vanity for a few days as I was hesitant to use them. Yesterday while applying my makeup I needed a brush to blend with and all of my regular ones were dirty so I broke out one of these bad boys. I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may have been a slight smell to them but I&#x27;m not someone bothered by scents. They are dense and so soft, and the best part is that they don&#x27;t wiggle around at the base (if that makes sense). I&#x27;ve spent $38 on just one brush at a makeup store and it wasn&#x27;t as sturdy feeling at these ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to these is that I did notice a little shedding on my shirt when I was all done putting on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update after these receive their first wash, but overall, I&#x27;m very happy with these. For the amount paid, they are a steal.</li>
    <li> Really great brushes... The application is flawless. However, the handles have begun falling off within a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful for the price. They do have a bit of a smell when they first come in and there are a few random hairs that are out of place but I haven&#x27;t experienced much shedding since I&#x27;ve washed them. Some brushes are denser than others but I&#x27;ve used every brush and they are great. I don&#x27;t own sigma brushes but I would not say these are of the same caliber or ever close (since I like my real technique brush more than this) but they are soft and nice brushes.</li>
    <li> These are probably the best value for your buck. I have had these brushes for a few months so they have gone through a few washes. I have not noticed a single piece of hair shedding. I am so impressed with these. I have mostly been using the larger brushes for my face and they are perfect for blending out your foundation, powdering your face, bronzing, blushing, and highlighting. I have used sigma brushes in the past and although those brushes are amazing, these BS-MALL brushes beat sigma in their prices by far and the quality is very comparable. I will highly recommend these for people who are in the market for new make up brushes but don&#x27;t want to spend a hundred bucks on one set. Buy these, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a while and one of my brushes is no more. Although that&#x27;s my fault. Anyways, the brushes are super soft I wish it was a pillow. There is a smell to it in the beginning when the arrive but the smell goes away in like a week or so. I use them along with a all my others brushes from ecotools the dragon pad brushes from here in Amazon. The brushes are amazing. Leaves the product nicely in my face. Doesn&#x27;t keep the product in the brush like others. I&#x27;m so glad I bought these. I&#x27;m loving them. I&#x27;m more than likely to buy again soon.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome for the price. They get the job done! Im very pleased! :)</li>
    <li> Great brushes!But they did have a STRONG chemical smell but after you wash them it goes away:)</li>
    <li> These are cheap, but great for the price. If you are saving to buy better brushes this is a temp sub.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes! Very happy</li>
    <li> These brushes were definitely not what I was expecting. The smaller brushes were almost too big to actually do any eyeshadow work. The barrels shook after the first wash and they just didn&#x27;t impress me; Overall I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> These are terrible! Could&#x27;ve gotten better ones at the dollar store!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with brushes but these are pretty high quality for the price, better than drugstore and on par with mid level brands like Real Techniques and Sephora.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. The small feathered/rounded/dome one is my favorite! Perfect blending brush!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t labeled so I don&#x27;t know what kind of brushes they are. But they are good brushes</li>
    <li> good for like my first two uses I thought i found a cheap alternative... nope! they broke after first wash and didnt hold up after first few makeup applications. they are very soft and look sleek but very mediocre</li>
    <li> I love love loveeeeee these brushes!!! Awesome quality no shedding a must buy!!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality and soft also I love it</li>
    <li> The brushes are super soft, I haven&#x27;t used them yet so I can&#x27;t review on their quality. However the handles came right out of the brush heads on four of the brushes right when I opened the package up. I had to glue them back together. This was only with four brushes out of the whole set. I&#x27;m disappointed that they needed repair before I could even use them</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with these brushes and their quality. They are so soft and they have an expensive feel to them. Not only that but they arrived way earlier than the expected date so I&#x27;m so happy about that</li>
    <li> LOVE THE BRUSHES THEY HOLD ITS SHAPE VERY WELL. AND THE MAKEUP GOES ON REALLY GOOD!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I tugged on the brushes hair to see if they would fall off, and they didn&#x27;t. So far they seem like they are going to be great. Excited to use them, and delivery was fast. I typically don&#x27;t write reviews, but again so far they seem to be worth the money, or even maybe got a great value.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes, work like a charm, great price too!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t purchase for makeup but for an art project.  Didn&#x27;t need every one so gave the extras to my wife.  We both agree these seem to be good quality for the price.  Bristles are soft and uniform.  Dense without being stiff.  No bristle loss noted even after several times washed and rinsed.</li>
    <li> I ordered these yesterday and the came in today, tried them out and I love them! 👌👌👌</li>
    <li> For the price, its worth it. Not the best brushes,but get the job done. Plus there cute. I&#x27;m content :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing , they blend very very very well. thanks send me samples</li>
    <li> These brushes are so awesome!! The reviews are true.  I mostly use these for my foundation application and it blends it so well.  I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best! Not only a good price but the quality is great!! Shipping was fast....reccommended to everyone!! Grab these up fast!!!</li>
    <li> Good brushes was very surprise!  Does the job when applying foundation and eye shadow.  Very good buy!</li>
    <li> Sooooo soft!!!! Can&#x27;t believe I paid $8 for 10 brushes! Awesome deal!</li>
    <li> I love them but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d know what&#x27;s for what. I mean the brushs don&#x27;t have labels. But they&#x27;re great</li>
    <li> Nice brushes for the price! The synthetic brush material is very soft and high quality with very minimal &amp;#34;shedding.&amp;#34; I took the advice of another buyer and reinforced the brushes with some hot glue under the handle to make them last longer--very easy to do! Overall I would recommend these brushes! I&#x27;m using them for liquid, cream, and powder mineral foundations.</li>
    <li> Really soft brushes absorb some product but not too much. Leaves a flawless finish</li>
    <li> Really good at blending and applying foundation/concealer</li>
    <li> These are really good brushes for the price.  I work in theatre makeup and they are great.</li>
    <li> Makes applying makeup very easy. It&#x27;s always good to have a complete set because you never know when you&#x27;ll need it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are priced well and are fantastic quality. I have high end brushes and these are just as good. Must buy!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! The quality is on point with higher end brushes, such as sigma. I have seen makeup companies selling these exact brushes, just rebranded, at a much higher price point. The packaging was very nice and they arrived clean and cared for. I wash them every few days and they are holding up very well. I plan to buy another set!</li>
    <li> For d money these r super kool..</li>
    <li> I love the Brushes. The only thing is that one of the Brushes fell apart. I was able to Put  it back together and it still working fine.</li>
    <li> they broke in the first few weeks i had them but still awesome brushes</li>
    <li> Great set. They look expensive and work just as good as the expensive kind. Love the price</li>
    <li> My sister loved them! They are so soft!</li>
    <li> They are just too soft for me. I couldn&#x27;t get make up to blend deeply.</li>
    <li> I am ordering another set! Love them!!! Would def. recommend them.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES! They are amazingly soft. The bristles are soft, and there is barely any fall out. My only thing is, on some of the brushes the head of the brush falls off! So i had to super glue them back on. Now you can&#x27;t eve tell they fell off. But none the less, I would recommend these to others.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes set of brushes, and shipping was great but they are not for people with sensitive skin. They make face inch so badly.</li>
    <li> When I pulled the brushes out of the plastic wrap, the entire room smelled like glue. I had to wash them several times in soapy water to dissipate the smell.</li>
    <li> Very soft and great quality</li>
    <li> Love these brushes so much that I ordered another set.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Great quality and very soft. I use them every day.</li>
    <li> Brushes are pretty nice. They feel soft and handle has great feeling.</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE this brush set! Trust me, I&#x27;ve always used MAC brushes and they would last me about year or so and I couldn&#x27;t fathom spending $200 on a new set again and again.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes from amazon work just as great if not BETTER! I personally like the softness of the brushes, feels better on skin. MAC brushes have a little more stiffness to them but like I said WELL WORTH THE MONEY TO BUY THIS SET O  AMAZON! thank you thank you thank you!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Way too big than I was expected. There are so many brushes in the package but none of them is small enough to be a lip or eye liner. Why do I need so many big ones with different shapes...</li>
    <li> I did not expect such great quality for that price.&lt;br /&gt;Love it,lots of brushes.</li>
    <li> The black part of the handle broke off in 10 days.</li>
    <li> its great...was dilvered quickly n its soft n of great quality</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re more than decent for their price. I love using these brushes whenever I apply my makeup. The foundation spreads evenly and the blush on is easily applied as well. Putting eye shadow is the hardest thing for me but with the brush here, it&#x27;s easier.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Brought two sets!</li>
    <li> So I will start off by saying that I did read other reviews before making this purchase, the good and the bad ones. I will say that the brushes themselves are extremely soft, so that was a plus for me. Upon reading some of the negative reviews I did read that these brushes did have a odor to them and most people could not get this to come out. For $10 dollars I was willing to give these brushes a try and see what I could do with them. I received them today in the mail and was very excited to try them out..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, when I went to sniff them for myself to see if they did contain an odor...I can guarantee that with in the next hour I will have a headache. These brushes do contain an odor on each one of them, it is not the packaging. It&#x27;s the actual bristles on the brushes. I washed one of the brushes out twice with two different products and the odor did decrease but it was still present. The odor is somewhat of paint mixed with gasoline. For this reason alone I will be returning these brushes and giving another set I will buy a go. When washing the brush out, only one or two bristles came out and that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me, just the odor is. So be warned that these brushes do contain an odor.</li>
    <li> Probably the best cheap brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!!! I like these a lot better than Real Technique brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and dense. They are definently a dupe for the sigma brushes. I highly recommend these!!</li>
    <li> Came in super fast in 2 days!! Super soft sturdy brushes very glad i decided to give them a try :)</li>
    <li> Good brushes! On time! Does not shed</li>
    <li> I bought these on my husband&#x27;s prime account and I love them!  I have been studying a lot about how to really apply makeup well and becoming an amateur makeup artist of sorts.  These brushes looked like a good place to start, but now that I have been working with them, I have compared them to higher end brushes and they are as good or better than most at a fraction of the price.  There has been no fall out and they apply flawlessly.  Easy to clean, which I have done with a spray daily and every other week with a brush shampoo and brush stand that dries them upside down to keep the water out of the glue.  As for the smell when you first open them, I washed them before first use and the smell was gone.  Just remember to dry them upside down!</li>
    <li> First I must say I only got these based on the reviews for product. Like most others mention they do have a strong smell to them, but as soon as opened and washed they were just fine! :) They are super soft and OMG the price is a steal in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great brushes glue isnt that great but for this price duct tape will work fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I order these, they&#x27;re perfect!</li>
    <li> Must buy! The brushes are amazing!</li>
    <li> Such a great brush set . So soft and so far no bristle loss . A great low cost option to the high price sets like Sigma</li>
    <li> The brushes had weird smell</li>
    <li> Very full and dense for so cheap, worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> One of the best brushes I&#x27;ve used and very affordable</li>
    <li> Very soft, very accurate. Love them</li>
    <li> When I first got them they had a strong paint smell. One use of them and three broke off the handle and many of them are really loose.</li>
    <li> Love! I do recommend washing them when you get them.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I needed another set to alternate when I clean my good brushes. I actually think these are just as good. The only down fall is they are not glued together very well. The top came apart from the handle on several but hot glue fixes it right up!</li>
    <li> Good brush set for the price</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. I am using them&lt;br /&gt;Mostly for blending my eye makeup but I have used two of the face brushes for contouring and blush. My brushes did not have a bad smell at all. My only complaint is that right out of the package one of the brush heads came right off. Not a big deal, I can just glue it back on. I would definitely say for the price they are great!!</li>
    <li> WOW second best purchase in Amazon. High quality brushes at a convenient pricing. they do have a strong smell from the plastic but other than that are very soft and look expensive.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and these are the dupes for BH cosmetics and for those of you who want to know the different uses of these brushes go to the bh cosmetics website and it will show you. Moreover the smell is very awful but I cleaned them very well and it went away so it depends how good you clean these they&#x27;re soft and my barrels did not break</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft which is nice. However, a few of the brushes came with some sort of glue on the top of the bristles and I have yet to figure out how to remove it. [Addendum: I checked the brushes and after having washed the brushes with BeautyBlender solid cleanser and on one of them the glue had turned to powder. Will try again with the other]. The brushes that came without the glue work very well but the eye brushes were bigger than expected so don&#x27;t expect precision they&#x27;re better for blending. Overall, worth what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It came in a very timely manner. The quality of it I am satisfied with. Brushes are soft. Met/exceeded my expectation.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really outstanding, they match right up there to my MAC and Sigma brushes and in fact I really like them much better then some of my expensive brushes.  They are very soft, no shedding even after washing.  Outstanding purchase.</li>
    <li> REALLY great quality for the price.  The brushes are super soft but also thick and sturdy.  I threw out all my old more expensive brushes.  The glue smell is overwhelming when these arrive, but after a night out the plastic wrap they smell fine.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!!! Especially the flat kabuki for my foundation, and the rounded one for concealer around my eyes. Such a value for great brushes! They look beautiful in person and do not shed!</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes. They feel soft on the skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect for makeup application.  However, it sucked that there were no smaller brushes!</li>
    <li> Excellent and unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very silky and perfect for beginners and long time users of makeup. A couple of my brushes had one hair on the brush that was sticking out, but I just used tweezers to pull it out not a problem. Also when you wash the brushes don&#x27;t wet the handle. I accidently got just a little bit of water on one and I noticed that the texture changed. But when I washed the actually brush I just wet the end and cleaned it off and there still very silky. Overall these brushes are great.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend: Yes there good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Wow! I purchased these as a stocking stuffer for my daughter and I am highly impressed with these delicious brushes! I am going to purchase a set for myself. They are soft, supple brushes without any odors with a very strong and sturdy handle and ferrule. I forsee these brushes lasting a long time with proper care. Fantastic quality for the price. I can&#x27;t say enough about these brushes. Buy em, I am sure you will like them if not love them especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late Entry: I purchased my brushes via Amazon Prime sold by Sunlion Shop.</li>
    <li> I love it. Beautifully soft</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and customer service is great and the delivery is highly on time ... Also it was my first time ordering of any site and I can assure you that this was a great experience ... I just received my brushes and they are so soft and great condition there is nothing wrong with the brushes themselves although the only thing that may not be liked by some people is the odor but I can assure you that won&#x27;t be a problem with how amazing your brushes are 👏 😍😍😍👌</li>
    <li> Very quick shipment...giving it away as a present so hoping for the best and will get her review</li>
    <li> all of these brushes are comparable to my sigma brushes. I recieved 5 kabukis for the price one ONE sigma brush! How amazing is that. I am so impressed. And I know where I&#x27;m getting my brushes from in the future. Do not be skeptical about these! They are high quality brushes. Buy buy buy!! 100% worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. I thought they were going to be cheaply made but they are just like the 30$ brushes I buy from sephora. You get more for the price of one..... Love it. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brush are great and for a week or two i was in love with these brushes. But now all the handles have fallen off and they are pretty much useless. I guess that is what you get when you buy make up brushes for so cheap though.</li>
    <li> Super soft &amp; a great value. You get a good selection of brushes for at a great price. I love them. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a smell, nothing a little brush cleaner couldn&#x27;t take care of.</li>
    <li> Great brushes overall! Arrived in 2 days (if you have Prime) and was packaged very well. The brushes did have a strong scent, but not as strong. Sadly, they did shed slightly, but not much. Just a few hairs now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash the brushes gently with warm soap and water. It will reduce most of the shedding. (Also make sure the water is on low and not rushing like crazy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Use a good, strong scented soap. The smell of the brushes won&#x27;t go away after one wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love these brushes and very good quality!</li>
    <li> Had a weird smell, and they didn&#x27;t have a guild to tell you what brush does what. But other than that they are great and soft and I love using them</li>
    <li> They were great and super soft</li>
    <li> Really good brushes. They seem to be resistant to use and abuse.  Great set for the price.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. For one thing, the brushes in all the images are gold, mine came in silver, which isn&#x27;t the biggest issue, but its not what the picture made it out to be. On the other hand, they are shedding really bad. I washed them and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping. I haven&#x27;t even attempted to apply my make up with these brushes. Seriously could&#x27;ve purchased these at Michael&#x27;s or any arts and crafts store.</li>
    <li> These brushes are by far the best foundation brush I had ever use and it is super duper soft. I&#x27;ve already washed them 3 times and I still have not gotten any shedding.If sigma brushes are too expensive for anyone to buy then I really recommend getting this cause it is seriously a dupe for it. It came in the mail fast and the packaging was in a box with bubble wrap all around the bag to keep it safe and within inside the bag the bushes were kept in their own individual platic covering.  You cannot get 10 amazing brushes anywhere else for under $20 and im planning to get more of these for myself and as a gift for my girly friends!</li>
    <li> Extremely good quality brushes for the price! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have a prime account and they were delivered in 2 days as promised. These brushes are GORGEOUS and I can&#x27;t wait to use them. Will be purchasing from this seller again soon. THANK U😘</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use all of them yet but the ones I use are sooo  synthetic soft , I don&#x27;t regret buying them ...❤❤</li>
    <li> love these brushes a lot would highly recommend, shipment was fast and the brushes were extremely soft... will buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> I love these brushes sooooo much. They are so soft and wash well. They are all versatile and lovely.</li>
    <li> Very good set of brushes, I use them daily. Some more than others of course but I&#x27;m about to purchase another set. I love em. Some call it cheap I think it&#x27;s just smart. Why should I pay more money for a products name when there is another product that will deliver it&#x27;s results? IJS... You spend your money the way that you want to and so will I. ;) Happy Shopping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Potter :)</li>
    <li> Extremely Happy with my purchase!!! These brushes are much better quality than MAC brushes, can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Great price! Win!</li>
    <li> They came apart, but I guess for the price the glue wasn&#x27;t included hahahahaha. I didn&#x27;t really care, I bought some glue and glued them. They&#x27;re good brushes and for the price...</li>
    <li> Bought for my girlfriend and she loves it so far. No issues with it. Does have the chemical smell but it has since gone away as other people have said. She uses it for contour and eye shadow and it applies both smoothly and without any of the bristles falling out. It&#x27;s just as good as the Mac brushes that I purchased for her for just a fraction of the price. I might buy another set for her to have a spare, and maybe another one for my mom. What a great product for the Price!!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected..</li>
    <li> This whole brush set was better than my $20 worth foundation brush by bare minerals. And I got 2 extra brushes ! The only thing I was disappointed about is that I didn&#x27;t get one brush in particular (the angled small brush for eyeliner) like in the picture given but I got 2 different small ones that are not in the picture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed of how quickly these arrived to me. The quality of the brushes are amazing. I kept reading about a strong smell however mine didn&#x27;t have one. They&#x27;re so soft and looks like they were made very well. I spend endless amount of money on brand name makeup brushes but none have felt anything like this. It picks up and holds the makeup better than any brush I own. I received them early this morning, after trying the out I&#x27;m going to order at least 2 more sets! WELL WORTH THE $11!!!</li>
    <li> Very good brushes definitely a must have. I use these more than my sigma brushes</li>
    <li> I got them today!! Loved them alll!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a great price!</li>
    <li> Really good brushes! I was surprised since they&#x27;re so cheap!</li>
    <li> Good brushes ..but they have a strange odor.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes at a great price. They get the job done!</li>
    <li> Brushes are really good and soft. Makeup stays in your face. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Brushes remind me a little of the RT brushes</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice. A little chinky but considering what I paid, I can deal. The only thing I really hate is that they reek like chemicals even after I cleaned them.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes!!! These brushes are a great product for a low price. I would definitely recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Good price and good quality</li>
    <li> I really loved the brush set when I first got it. But after 3-4 uses some of the brush heads became lose and wiggly, by the 6th use half of them fell off. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> 3 of the brushes were attached from the handles when I received it. I really like the brushes but I can&#x27;t use all of them. Would definitely want a replacement</li>
    <li> The bristles are very soft and dense. Favorite brush purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes but they broke apart easily</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  Only wish there was a fine tipped one for liner.  They are working just as well as some more expensive brands I have purchased.  Would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes! I have used them many times now and I am super happy with my purchase! My foundation goes on flawlessly and they give more coverage than a sponge! My brushes have shed only a little bit, but it is nothing to be too worried about. (I will probably hot glue the hairs inside just in case)</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for beginners taping into makeup or if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on high end brush sets.  They are soft just like high end brushes but of course not the same quality.  very good for the price I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These have been great so far.  No shedding!</li>
    <li> They came in the mail the day they were supposed to which was good. But they did have a smell to them, like paint. So you&#x27;d have to wash them, I took makeup remover and brush cleaner to them and it did the trick. I&#x27;ve used them a couple of times and one of the tops to the brush fell off, but it seemed like they were already super glued on so I&#x27;ll just have to do that again.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best brushes I have ever used. Would recommend to someone who is a beginner in makeup because i got these when i was a beginner and they have been with me ever since. Great quality, the hairs of the brush don&#x27;t come out and they have been in tacked for 1 1/2 years.</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended these to me.  She&#x27;s a cosmetologist.  I thought - for this price I&#x27;m sure they are crap.  But I figured she knows.  So, I ordered them and I LOVE them!!!  They do not leave little hairs on your face, they are soft, they apply nicely.  I use them to apply my CC cream from IT cosmetics and my eyeshadows and such. I mean, they aren&#x27;t IT brushes....but then again, they don&#x27;t cost anywhere near what those brushes cost!  Worth the small investment for great brushes.</li>
    <li> Great value this set is fantastic</li>
    <li> So soft! They are great brushes!</li>
    <li> Am so disappointed  these brushes are soft but ichy after use and smell a lot like and chemicals like petroleum do not buy</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the quality of this set. Reall nice. I&#x27;ve bought a couple sets for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> just what she wanted!</li>
    <li> These are really good for smoothing foundation to a very thin layer... I reach for these above and beyond any of my other brushed... and the price! Wow.. can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> They do stink like paint, but these brushes our amazing! I have had mine a while now, have already washed them and used them quite a bit and they are still super soft! I will only ever by these from here on out but only for the face brushes, the eye brushes are far too big.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes fast shipping. Con brushes smelled like acetone</li>
    <li> I like these brushes.  They are very elegant-looking and they perform well.  They have held up well with little to no shedding and they did not come apart, as some people have experienced.  Because of some of the reviews, I was planning to take these apart and reinforce the brush head with some glue, but I wasn&#x27;t able to take them apart.  I find they are very well constructed and I didn&#x27;t need to reinforce the brush head as some other reviewers did.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that they seem to take a long time to dry after washing them.  Usually letting my other brushes dry overnight is sufficient, but these need about 24 hours.  Since I don&#x27;t have a lot of brushes, but wear makeup often, this can be a challenge.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  They are very soft and apply makeup well.  I had read reviews about bristles coming out, and I have not had that problem; however, the other day I noticed black smears all over my makeup bag and on some of my makeup.  I thought I had left the cap off of my eyeliner or something and began to search for the source.  I was surprised to find that two of the brush handles appeared to have actually somehow melted off and was smearing all over everything.  I stored all the brushes and my makeup the same way and all together and though I will say I live in Florida and the summer is quite hot, but only two of the brushes had &amp;#34;melted,&amp;#34; one much worse than the other, but not even my lipstick or eyeliner had melted, so it wasn&#x27;t from just being hot.  Not sure what the issue is, but I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> very high quality brushes! no shedding either</li>
    <li> Great quality for a great price!</li>
    <li> Loved how thick and fluffy they are. They blend powders beautifully. Had a slight chemical smell but that went away with one washing.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice once you figure out what each of them are for. None of the brushes are labeled at all; no numbers &amp; no description. It&#x27;s all good if you do makeup professionally, but if not you have to do a little research.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable awesome !!! the best price for a great brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> My brushes came a day early, and I&#x27;m very happy with them! Have yet to use them, but I am excited to try. They are very soft, no hairs falling out, and the only downside is that they smell pretty strongly of something like paint, which I am assuming is the packaging and synthetics. No worries; washing will get rid of that!</li>
    <li> for the price these are great! especially the smaller ones, they are great blending brushes for the crease, the face ones are ok but not bad</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter. She LOVED them. I was even surprised by the quality and quantity for this price!</li>
    <li> Great brushes, fabulous quality!</li>
    <li> They are awesome and great price</li>
    <li> These are THE BEST make up brushes I&#x27;ve EVER had!!! Five stars are not enough to give for these! They were were the wait (one month). Brushes this nice are often as much for ONE as I paid for this entire set of TEN.</li>
    <li> Brushes are amazing! I was some what skeptical about them since the weren&#x27;t expensive but I loved them. I can say that they are up on market like Morphe brushes.</li>
    <li> Five words... LOVE....LOVE...LOVE...ABSOLUTELY...AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft, but they are nothing like I was expecting. The tops come off the handles after just one use. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The best makeup brushes I have ever had! The big ones are AMAZING! They feel great on my skin and blend in my makeup really well. I like to contour my makeup too, and these allow my contouring to look flawless. I did see some other reviews about the brushes smelling badly, so I sniffed mine as soon as they arrived. There was no odor, they seemed to be clean. The smaller ones are of less use to me. They&#x27;re not great for eye shadow application because they&#x27;re a little too big if you&#x27;re trying to do three or more colors. Still, the smaller brusher are of use when I&#x27;m in a hurry and just want to use one color on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> The reviews were right and these brushes are truly awesome. So soft. They do have a chemical smell, but I just washed them with Dawn soap.</li>
    <li> so soft! great for the price</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft. And they came in quicker then I expected.</li>
    <li> Very soft! Amazing price! Great starter set. Keep in mind the brushes are pretty similar in size and comparable in shape.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. At first unpackaging they smelled really bad of paint but it wore off. I am happy with only one face brush because others are slightly too tall from the ferrel. Very soft though and provide good blending.</li>
    <li> Came in on time, very soft bristles and dense brushes for the price. Great if you&#x27;re on a budget and won&#x27;t budge on quality.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft with little to no shedding.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller 5 brushes aren&#x27;t great to get much product on. Definitely not for a good eye makeup application. But I&#x27;m happy with all the big brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the handles do come apart after a few months for me, but I&#x27;ve got great industrial strength glue, so that&#x27;s no problem for me. It&#x27;s a bit bothersome when they do come off, but for the price I&#x27;m getting these brushes, I will look over this!</li>
    <li> The bristles are great. My makeup is applied very smoothly. However, the reason I give these brushes 3 stars out of 5 is because all 5 of the larger brushes started falling apart nearly the 2nd time I used them. The bristles have been staying in place, but the black plastic part of the brush becomes loose and falls off. So, I&#x27;ve reserved to gluing the handles back on with super glue. I haven&#x27;t even gotten the handles wet...the original glue just doesn&#x27;t stick.</li>
    <li> The were perfect the first 2 weeks . Afterwards they began to break. The top separated from the wood.</li>
    <li> Great quality and even better price</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! Even though they&#x27;re synthetic they&#x27;re really soft and feel great on your skin. This is a basic brush set and doesn&#x27;t have everything one might need. Luckily I have some a couple other sets that supplement this set. The overall blending results are great!</li>
    <li> These brushes are exactly what you pay for. The bristles fall off easily and the handle comes unattached, I had to hot glue all of them only a week after I bought it! If you want something cheap, this is perfect for you but if you are looking for good, high tech makeup brushes these are not it.</li>
    <li> The brushes had a funny smell to them but it&#x27;s nothing a quick wash didn&#x27;t fix. They are good brushes for the price I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Love a couple of them more than anything else I have. Perhaps a bit on the soft side but a great value.</li>
    <li> I am a professional cosmetologist and makeup artist and I really liked these. Nice quality brushes for the price. They are very soft and seem to be made well. However, the SMELL IS SO BAD. like strong chemical or permanent marker smell x100. Very bad odor. I will definitely need to wash these before I use them</li>
    <li> Wonderful selection of makeup brushes.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Omg yessssss!!!! These are amazing! They&#x27;re so cute and for the price why not? This is my second time ordering these super easy to clean and extremely soft 😍😍😍😍. They look similar to the ones bh cosmetics sells but these are cheaper and work just as good :) only downside is I tried cleaning one of the eye brushes and the hairs started shedding but on my second set I had no problems at all :)</li>
    <li> I am seriously so shocked at how soft these are! I was just browsing on Amazon one day and saw these brushes, the great reviews and then the price and was like &amp;#34;what&#x27;s 8 bucks&amp;#34;. I really don&#x27;t need them since I buy more and more brushes over the years and never seem to get rid of the old ones so this will be a cool gift for my little sister since she&#x27;s at the age to experiment with makeup. But wow if I ever want brushes I&#x27;m for sure buying these again.</li>
    <li> I love how soft these brushes are but they do have a strong chemical smell..After the first wash the bigger brushes started to shed ALOT. I mean I guess you get what you pay for. However, I&#x27;m a little disappointed,I was expecting to love them after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
    <li> The large brushes work very well to apply liquid foundation flawlessly. They are dense, soft, and don&#x27;t shed even though they&#x27;ve been through a lot  of washing. I haven&#x27;t tried the skinny brushes but I&#x27;m sure they will work just as well, if not I will update my review. I took off a star because they had a huge chemical smell when they arrived that took a very long time to get out. I had to wash time 3 or 4 times to get the smell out. Also the large pointed brush had a lot of white powder that came off of it. I didn&#x27;t know what it was so it was quite unsettling.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for a friends.  She mentioned shedding but otherwise quality was nice.  Decent substitute if you can not get your hands on higher quality brushes.</li>
    <li> The chemical smell is horrible. I tried to get the smell out by washing them but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing for blending!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes.!!! They are soft, inexpensive and applies makeup smoothly and well. it a must have .</li>
    <li> Great quality...great price! I would definitely recommend purchasing this make-up brush set to anyone who is looking for professional quality make-up brushes but does not want to spend hundreds of dollars.</li>
    <li> soo inlove with these brushes! Very affordable! Super soft and very good quality!!</li>
    <li> These brushes shead slightly however nothing that will make you think twice about them. I will be reordering the face brushes because I use them very often. The blend makeup great! &amp; the price was amazing!</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for the price. They are really soft and work wonders. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Excelent !!!!i love it😊</li>
    <li> I love the brushes, i really like how it touches my face and how it applies the make up and everything 5 stars it is</li>
    <li> Love! These brushes are excellent!</li>
    <li> They Are Amazing . They are soft the only complaint i have is that 2 brushes where bent</li>
    <li> A couple of brushes broke but they are good brushes</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price! Would recommend</li>
    <li> I took them out of the package and used them immediately and all the hair of the brush started to fall off. Do not recomment it</li>
    <li> soft and dense! I like the handle length, ive just washed them its taking quite some time ( which indicates density) to dry. immediately when I received the package I smelled the brushes - didn&#x27;t get an awful scent that people were describing, minimal shedding with first wash. Brilliant brush set for the price!</li>
    <li> Best $10 I ever spent!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so soft!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price!</li>
    <li> I love the big brushes. The quality is just as good as more expensive brands. However, the &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; brushes are still quite large to be used for eyes. I sometimes just use them to contour my nose, put on concealer and occasionally use them to blend my eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> The packaging had a weird smell</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with my brushes!! 😍</li>
    <li> Great brushes and I&#x27;ll be buying more. :)</li>
    <li> Great collection of brushes but the small brushes aren&#x27;t small enough for eye shadow.  They are great for contouring and blush or foundation but way too large and cumbersome to use for eye-shadow.  Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy another set of smaller brushes.</li>
    <li> Really great set works perfectly with my makeup...also great for beginners(:</li>
    <li> good for the price.  Lots of brushes</li>
    <li> Worst brushes ever! The face brushes didn&#x27;t even blend anything, and I didn&#x27;t even receive most of the eye brushes!</li>
    <li> To start off, I am a huge makeup junkie and own both very expensive and inexpensive makeup brushes. These are by far my favorite brushes to use for blending concealers, cream contour, and liquid/cream foundation. They blend my makeup out so beautifully and I always reach for them vs the expensive brushes. For $8, they were a steal. Apart from this, they are poorly constructed and have a strong chemical smell but it&#x27;s an easy fix. I just reglued all the brush heads back to the handle with hot glue and to get rid of the chemical smell, wash all the brushes and air them out for a week. The smell goes away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  happy with them, perfect for me, hight quality for the price. Soft and  dense brushes. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself, but my daughter took them! Will be buying another set!</li>
    <li> I guess I can&#x27;t complain because of the price, but these were pretty cheap. Very soft and they look nice, yet one of the brushes immediately lost almost 1/3 of the bristles from it. Very cheap.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great.  So far no shedding and they sure seem to be holding up well.  I like these better than some of the others I have that I spent mega bucks for.</li>
    <li> The heads came off after a little while but a little glue fixed them right up good brushes nice and soft</li>
    <li> Love the price and they shipped fast</li>
    <li> Sometimes it turns when taking pics</li>
    <li> They are very soft, thick, and lush. Really nice for such a cheap price. I am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I love this item!! Brushes came in a few days and they are absolutely soft!! Very great quality and I definitely see myself using these daily.</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes! So soft, all the shapes I need. One of the angle brushes, however, has bristles come loose often.  I don&#x27;t think this reflects on the brush package as a whole and still recommend this set!</li>
    <li> Im in love with this brushes.</li>
    <li> I got the brushes today, and they are wonderful. Like the other reviews say, there is a bit of a chemical smell to them, but overall, it didn&#x27;t really affect their quality. A very nice set.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many of these before but never had the option of purchasing in the new colors.  I recently purchased a &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; and sent it back for a replacement because I keep receiving a coral color but not the pink as advertised.  These brushes are fantastic and I gift them frequently.  However, I am ordering the pink for me and will have to settle on another color as coral is not a favorite color for me.  Don&#x27;t let this review keep you from ordering, as the quality of these brushes is very good.</li>
    <li> The brushes are amazing, they apply perfectly and smooth. They&#x27;re not labeled, so you have to know what the brushes are used for. No shedding like MAC brushes and they&#x27;re so soft and easy to handle. I highly recommend these for their price and quality.</li>
    <li> They do have a weird smell but great very soft brushes and very dense! I don&#x27;t mind the smell. Nothing a couple cleanings can&#x27;t fix!</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect,  my makeup has never looked so flawless. they are super fluffy and extremely soft. they do come with a weird chemical smell almost like acrylic nails smell but if you wash them they don&#x27;t smell anymore and they&#x27;re perfectly fine. overall this is a really really great set of brushes and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and makeup glides right on.  I&#x27;ve purchased 3 sets.  Myself, and for my 2 daughters.  Now the granddaughters want them.</li>
    <li> Great product, very soft, but they do have a strong scent. It can be aired out not sure why it smells (Smells like a car) but still a great buy. Still deserves 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look okay.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! it does resemble sigma, and the quality is amazing for the price!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her new brushes</li>
    <li> The bushes are such a great quality! They are definitely worth much more than what they cost.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. After reading the reviews I thought the brushes would shed and have a bad smell. When I received the brushes no bad smell and no shedding. The brushes are very soft and worth it.</li>
    <li> When I first received them there was such a strong chemical amell almost like a varnish type smell but I left them on my balcony to air out for a day and then it was pretty much gone. They are very good brushes, I own many sigma brushes and also mac and these are just as good. The small ones have been great for doing my eye makeup and blending And I use the bigger ones for buffing in foundation and powders.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very good quality and you get a good assortment of sizes</li>
    <li> they did have a very strong smell of chemicals or paint when first opened but after washing the brushes once the smell was gone. I&#x27;ve had them for months and none of the hair fall out, they&#x27;re the softest brushes i own and such a great price! deff will be ordering more soon</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t set my expectations really high bc I don&#x27;t want to get disappointed but I actually liked it!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are inexpensive but I swear I use them more for my makeup than my expensive nice brushes! The bigger ones are GREAT for liquid foundation, powder, and I like the smaller ones to cover up blemishes on my face with concealer. These were a great buy and if I need more brushes one day, I will definitely repurchase them. They were also really easy to clean and dry.</li>
    <li> Like no lies this is like so good..like for that price...wow mine hasn&#x27;t dismantled yet but i bought glue just in case</li>
    <li> Great brushes! As a make up artist, I look for good quality brushes. It&#x27;s bigger than what I thought but definitely a plus! The brushes are full, not limp. It is very soft and does a great job blending. Great price for quality brushes!</li>
    <li> Very soft and feels great against your skin.  For the price I would recommend this product to everyone:)</li>
    <li> I loooove this brushes. They are so soft and apply my makeup beautifully. They don&#x27;t have a horrible smell like other reviews say they do, mine just had that new smell but didn&#x27;t last. Good brushes for a low price.</li>
    <li> For the price these are great brushes!! The face brushes are the best because of the variety of uses when I feel the eyeshadow brushes could have been more diverse.</li>
    <li> Loved i! They&#x27;re amazing brushes &amp; great delivery.</li>
    <li> love the softness of the brushes</li>
    <li> Very nice set of brushes; I&#x27;ve been using them for about 6 months now and they are holding up well. The set includes several different shapes/sizes, so from face, contour, blush to different shader brushes, this set has you covered. I definitely recommend these for anyone who takes makeup a bit more seriously but doesn&#x27;t want to shell over a fortune for Sigma or Mac brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great and good quality and i love them but, they only sent me 9 brushes instead of 10. Pretty upset about that.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft so far it&#x27;s been working really good, the only bad thing is that they have a funny smell so washing them is a must before using it</li>
    <li> I am now applying my makeup flawlessly. Nothing more needs to be said.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Great value, and the bristles don&#x27;t come off after using them!</li>
    <li> LOve love love! it applies​ your makeup on flawlessly</li>
    <li> Love these makeup brushes they feel nice,the brush brisels do not come out which i was worried about when i purchased so no worries for that.</li>
    <li> Well they havent held up so good. A few of the handles came off, I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> Brushes are to hard and thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recived them on time , they are really soft &amp; I love them already. I can&#x27;t wait to use them! The only downfall is they have a weird paint smell to them? But I&#x27;m sure it will go away , for now i give it 3 starts !</li>
    <li> Good quality. I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> As beautiful as the picture.very soft.haven&#x27;t used them for long but I noticed no shedding when giving them their first wash....so far it&#x27;s love at first sight:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also quick delivery! And the price is pretty good too...highly recommend them</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE these brushes and for the price they are awesome! I went to ulta and tried to find brushes and for a set like this would of cost me around 30 bucks these are perfect.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get into much detail about the product but if your SO loves makeup stuff just drop some dollars on this and make her happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction an product. Very Pleased!</li>
    <li> Smelled awful like everyone said at first. They are very stiff also.....break them in and they work GREAT.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT IT DOESN&#x27;T PRINT ONCE I PUT THEM IN THE PRINTER IT SEEMS LIKE THEY&#x27;RE MIXED WITH WATER NONE OF THEM PRINT. ANY OF THE COLORS. SO UNHAPPY THIS WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> Love playing with them. Wish there was instructions. Spending allot of time on YouTube trying to figure it out.</li>
    <li> Super soft, I really like them!</li>
    <li> Great brushed. Great price</li>
    <li> Not bad.  Good quality. For price just buy them.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality brushes for the price. The bristles are very soft, the brushes clean easily, and they seem fairly well made.</li>
    <li> Before I bought these brushes I made sure to read every review and look up some YouTube videos about them. Once I saw that the customers were satisfied I ordered them. I got them within 2 days and they were so soft and beautiful! No shedding, no itchiness, and the best part  they&#x27;re amazing brushes! I recommend them to those who don&#x27;t want to spend $20-$50 on one brush!</li>
    <li> So i just got my brushes today, i started using them right away. When i got the brushes out of the plastic they were in (each brush) i took each brush one at a time and rubbed them across my hand. The thin angled brush started shedding immediately. It didnt exactly even start shedding, the hair just started falling out. I was very upset. I used my brushes right away and loved how my makeup came out. They are soft. Not super soft but soft to my liking. Btw if u are a beginner i recommend these. Brushes :)</li>
    <li> Bomb.com.....love them</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe there are any negative reviews on these brushes. It is less that $1 a brush for goodness sakes. I have many expensive brushes that are not as nice as these.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers complained that some of the handles broke off. The handles broke off some of my expensive brushes too. Get some crazy glue and fix them. You simply cannot beat this price!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> Eactly what I expected</li>
    <li> The first time I used these brushes, I totally thought they wouldn&#x27;t work well with my powder cosmetic products and they worked just wonderfully!!! They glided on so well and were able to blend well as well! I was so amazed and in love with them that they make me want to do my makeup EVERYDAY! Love them so much.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes for the price! Only downsides are that the brushes smell strongly of chemicals and that I received two of the same kind and no big fluffy brush. Not a huge deal though as I already have one from another company and since the brushes work great.</li>
    <li> These are seriously amazing. They are super dense and soft and perfect for buffing in liquids and creams. The eye shadow brushes are super soft, but they are a little big so it&#x27;s kind of hard to be precise. I haven&#x27;t found any shedding with mine and I&#x27;m really impressed. I have sigma and morphie brushes, and these hold their own in the pack.</li>
    <li> Really wonderful, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Super soft bristles. I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and they did not fall apparat and the bristles did not loose the softness.</li>
    <li> My daughter really loves you.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes ! My sister got these brushes months ago and I just had to get some of my own ! For being a dollar or less for each brush I cant complain at all. 5 little brushes are perfect for blending eyeshadow or spot concealing I have no complain on them they came exactly on the day they were supposed I will repurchase again and again. And for everyone complaining you have to rememeber that you get what you pay for if you want high class brushes go to mac or something! I think that the quality of these brushes ARE what I paid for and better! Love them soooo much!</li>
    <li> very soft, smooth, and it makes me feel like I am a professional Makeup Artist,</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and wrapped individually; however, they are worth the price. Having said that,  they are not quality . Very cheaply made. Shedding before I could even get one out of the plastic. Not dense, at all. I&#x27;m hoping to get some use, out of a couple of them. But I don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this product! It&#x27;s phenomenal, would buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been getting many uses out of these brushes, and they are gentle on the skin.  However, the gold base on a few of the ones I use often is coming apart from the wood handle. Nothing a little glue wont fix but I prefer my products to be complete when I receive them.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!! Especially the flat kabuki and the tapered pointed one! Can&#x27;t beat the quality or the price! Will definitely be re purchasing in the future</li>
    <li> Great quality, I use them everyday. No fall out. I would recommend! Awesome buy</li>
    <li> This was a great makeup brush set--especially for the money!</li>
    <li> These are great for their price, but the brushes are too soft for my liking. They don&#x27;t hold as much make up so I feel like I use more make up.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They&#x27;re super soft, but have a chemical smell to them. After two washes the odor went away.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I can&#x27;t even stop looking at it!</li>
    <li> for the price you can&#x27;t beat it! They&#x27;re very dense and soooo soft! In love !!</li>
    <li> Loveeeeeeee these brushes</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING deal for the price. I will say that since I only had 4 brushes before ordering these, I am still trying to figure out the different uses for all of them. The only reason that I have given this 4/5 stars is because the smaller brushes could stand to be a little bit more dense. This is mainly in regards to the flat top / stippling like brush that is meant for concealing blemishes. I find that the hairs are too long and bend to much to really pack the product on a problem spot. Also, as others have said, they do smell like paint but that scent wears off quickly. Also (since I&#x27;m being nit picky) a few hairs did shed from the big flat top brush from foundation, which isn&#x27;t a huge deal as it has only happened during on application, BUT does make me hope that they will not quickly fall apart. Overall, I would definitely say if you are new to the brush world and aren&#x27;t sure what you want/need, this is a great deal to get you started !</li>
    <li> These are just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this set. 😍👌🏼</li>
    <li> The very day I received the brush, the handles started coming off. I returned the package the next day. I shouldn&#x27;t be glueing something to keep it steady on the very same day I bought.</li>
    <li> These brushes looked just as they did in the picture. They were packaged nicely the only issue I had was the smell. Once I washed them once and let them dry they were good to go. I would definitely purchase these brushes again. They apply my foundation and powder flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Such great brushes for cheap!!</li>
    <li> smelly so you have to clean, but once cleaned, works really well.</li>
    <li> Bristles are very soft and makeup application goes on with no problem.</li>
    <li> Omg these brushes are amazing, let me tell you I was a bit scare to buy them because i was afraid that they weren&#x27;t going to be soft, and that they were going to shed. But apparently I made a great decision on buying them because theyre super soft and they didn&#x27;t end up shedding!  &amp;#60;3 so worthy! And inexpensive, who doesn&#x27;t like great quality for less money! Im definitely going to be buying more :D</li>
    <li> I love this brushes I got then on the time they are so soft n my don&#x27;t small am so glad I got this brushes I can use on my clients</li>
    <li> Excellent the only bad thing i can say is that they have a very strong smell like chemichals or alcohol but wash them and you are good to go.. They seem like really good brushes for the price</li>
    <li> Just received these today. They are very soft and professional looking but they do have a very very strong chemical odor that gets in your mouth. Even after moving away from them I could still taste it. It would also have been nice if there had been some sort of guide with them telling you what each brush is used for. They are nice brushes though.</li>
    <li> I did not recieve all of my brushes this is why i gave four stars. Love love love the brushes I&#x27;ve been looking for inexpensive brushes that work well with makeup  and eye-shadow and this is it. I read the reviews and some people were saying that their gold tops separated from the black handles mine did not. I even try to pull them apart an it stayed together. When you first get them make sure you was them it has a paint scent to them when you open them but once you wash th the smell is gone.The pigment for the eye shadows came out strong and flawless. I would recommend this to anyone from begginers to experts</li>
    <li> Amazing blends so good especially when contouring</li>
    <li> i use these everyday! they are amazing and the price is so reasonable.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my grand-daughter. She was very happy with them</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting or looking for.</li>
    <li> Edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these makeup brushes in 2015. It is now 2017 and I am still using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These makeup brushes are durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles stay intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND this product. It is hands down my favorite makeup brush purchase.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to recieve my brushes. The minute they arrived I opened the package. There is a sheet that instructed the role of each brush, which was totally helpful because I am not experienced with brushes. The brushes do not look or feel cheap. Great buy! Will purchase for friends Thanks!</li>
    <li> Definitely would recommend. Good quality for a low price only thing is they come apart easily but just need to be glued.</li>
    <li> My favorite purchase from Amazon I work at sephora so I&#x27;ve used plenty of brushes and these did not disappoint! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t review for longevity, but initially I do like these brushes. They are super soft but not very dense. I used my other brand, more expensive brush to apply my foundation and then completed the rest of my routine (mineral powder, blush, bronze, highlight, and eye shadow with these. Eye shadow is difficult as the brushes are pretty large, I did a simple two color application and the brush was great to blend them. They did have a smell, but I washed with dawn and water and it went away inmediately. My package did say a 4 month warranty for these, that&#x27;s nice since they were so cheap anyway.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time, as described the only thing one of the tip came off on one the brushes just had to glue it back.</li>
    <li> Came nicely packaged and they&#x27;re incredibly soft. There&#x27;s a weird odor coming from them and I&#x27;m hoping that washing them will get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;-update: weird smell did come off and they&#x27;re still super soft!</li>
    <li> These were purchased as a gift!</li>
    <li> Really really soft. Great for makeup beginners like myself as the basic brushes you need. I will say they are really absorbent the first couple uses and I had to use a bit more product than usual because they soaked up the liquid foundation. They smell a little funky when you take them out of the packaging, but I just rinsed them before using and the smell went away (it was like a sanitary factory smell). Other than that, which I can&#x27;t really complain about, they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes! Couldn&#x27;t imagine life without them.</li>
    <li> Yes loved these makeup brushes!!</li>
    <li> For this price, these are some GREAT brushes! Soft and fluffy yet very sturdy. I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding which is great and they do not have an odor. I use these brushes everyday.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING ! They are very soft and they feel great on the skin. I love them and use them everyday ! I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes and is good to use even on a sensitive type of skin. It&#x27;s as light as a feather if you use it to apply your makeup. Really worth the price.</li>
    <li> Poorly constructed,  feel apart after 3rd use</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality. I am not one to spend lots of money on brushes, I saw the reviews and I thought I give them a try for the price. I obsoletely loved them!!!</li>
    <li> Very soft easy to work with</li>
    <li> I really  like the bristles but so far 3 out of 5 bug brushes fell  apart  (the handle separated from the metal part) took forever to get them and when i finally did they started falling apart OB DAY 2 i usually never write negative reviews but im really disappointed  with this</li>
    <li> There okay not to shabby. They&#x27;re soft at first but then get rough over time. Still a really good buy for the price :)</li>
    <li> These are glorious! Great price! Holds lots of product or very little if desired! Not cheap feeling at all!</li>
    <li> These are reall soft and they work really well but they arrived with a strong chemical odor and some of the hairs are uneven and come out. But they are great for the price.</li>
    <li> I really researched makeup brush sets on Amazon and other makeup review sites. I have never had a set of brushes so I wanted to read lots of feedback and see ratings so I would choose wisely. I, also, didn&#x27;t want to be overwhelmed with too many very specific purpose brushes as a newbie. I read the reviews on this set and the rating was very high. When the set of brushes arrived, there was a heavy pungent chemical-like odor as soon as I opened the box. The brushes were sealed but they reeked.&lt;br /&gt;I took Organic Chemistry Lab in college and you never forget that smell. There is no way that the set didn&#x27;t stink when they were packed and sent to me. I immediately returned them. Obviously, I would give a NO star rating but that is not possible.</li>
    <li> Love how they look . Haven&#x27;t tried putting them on my face yet though but I&#x27;m already inlove with them !!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! Have fun experimenting on new looks everyday!!! Great addition my my brush family at home all brushes very nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Great brushes to add to my collection!</li>
    <li> If I could have rated these a 10 star I would have! Great brushes!</li>
    <li> I got the brushes this afternoon, I was excited upon opening them. The first thing I noticed was they smelled like paint - but honestly wasn&#x27;t to worried about that as I could wash them.&lt;br /&gt;But I start touching all of them and all of sudden the hair in one brush came half way out in my hand. Which sucks.. I really wanted to like these. Now I am going to go check all of them to ensure the bristles don&#x27;t fall out of each one..</li>
    <li> I loved the brushes. I use half of then on a daily basis. They even came in weeks earlier than I thought they were. I would definitely but again.</li>
    <li> The only thing I wish is that they came with a diagram so you knew which to use for which products. I pretty much figured out on my own.  Have used twice. No funny smell, no bristles falling out.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes.  No hairs falling out so far after 3 months of use.</li>
    <li> My big tapered brush fell apart! The handle somehow got disconnected with the gold part. I just super glued it back together. Other than that they are super soft. Just like expensive ones like sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brush set. Especially for face  product application. This is my second set, because I loved the first ones and wanted back up.</li>
    <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR QUALITY BRUSHES. YOU COULD GET BETTER ONES AT THE DOLLAR STORE.</li>
    <li> I still can&#x27;t believe that I was able to find such high quality brushes for such a cheap price. Don&#x27;t waste your money at Sephora, girls. These brushes are amazing.</li>
    <li> Not as good as natural bristle brushes.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft, fluffy and work perfectly. They have made it into a constant rotation in my collection and sometimes I prefer these over some of my more expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention they are soft?! They also hold up exceptionally well to washes and no shedding. I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase for sure.</li>
    <li> First glance, there was no shedding but after a few months, it started to fall apart. That&#x27;s expected though for how much I do makeup. I love these brushes so much and I&#x27;ve boughten them 2 different times but I wish there was better glue to hold the wooden and metal part together!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are so soft and does a great job at smoothing out foundation.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived on time and in wonderful condition. I can&#x27;t believe I paid so little for such high quality. Very little shedding, soft, applies my cosmetics beautifully!!</li>
    <li> Not very big or sturdy. After 2 days 4 brushed came apart and the bristles already shedding. Would return but value not worth my time. I had to just put them in garbage.</li>
    <li> Love them but one of the brushes was shredding  so I had to throw away but they work good</li>
    <li> I love these brushes for the price they do a excellent job...I use them several times so far No sheading</li>
    <li> So far the brushes I have used are good. The eyeshadow brushes could be a little stiffer for greater color application.</li>
    <li> I am super pleased with how fast they got to me; however, when I opened the package it smells so strongly of chemicals- almost like paint thinner. I hope it disapates soon or I probably won&#x27;t want to use them. they look like great quality brushes though, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! I expected 100% and I received 200% awesome make up brushes! 😄😄😄</li>
    <li> Soft and amazing for the price. Definitely recommend to anyone!</li>

    <li> Very soft, came fast, doesn&#x27;t pick up colors well tho</li>
    <li> These bruses are nice... allergic to them!! Feel my face was burning...</li>
    <li> These brushe are amazing!!! and at a great price, they are so soft! I will def order again!</li>
    <li> these are great... not great quality, but look at the price point.&lt;br /&gt;one tip came off straight away but it can be glued back on</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price, I will reorder again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft! I&#x27;ve been using them for a little while now, and so far they seem very durable.</li>
    <li> Ordered these brushes over 2 weeks ago and received them in less than 48hrs. When I purchased them I did not expect them to be so thick &amp; soft. I immediately tested them for shedding but not one single hair came off. It has been 2 weeks that I&#x27;ve been using them and I even gave my BB a rest because they&#x27;re so good at applying foundation. Even after their first wash, they have not shed or lost their softness.</li>
    <li> They delivered on time and I love them. They are so soft and now hairs come out on your face when your using makeup. Really good price for that good of quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!! Cheap but good quality! Super soft! Dupe for sigma or BH brush set!</li>
    <li> Love these for the price!</li>
    <li> They look ok, but have a funky smell</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. I&#x27;ve only used them a couple of times but they are by far my favorite that I&#x27;ve used. They have a smell to them but wash them with dawn and you&#x27;ll be fine. It blends and puts on make up well! They&#x27;re also super soft!</li>
    <li> Appear to be cheaply made but very soft!!</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes at a great price. They are very good quality and you will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think because of the reviews but I have had no problem with the hairs falling off. I can see what people are saying about the paint smell, but it didn&#x27;t really bother me. This is my first set of makeup brushes and as a girl first introducing herself to makeup, these work really nicely. I&#x27;m just proud to say I have my own(; Came in a timely manner, appear as they do in pictures,  would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good brushes but handlem started coming off in less than 2 months</li>
    <li> Terrible quality! Hairs started shedding before I even used it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It worked better as a paint brush -__-</li>
    <li> Brushes are awesome iI&#x27;ve paid more for horrible name brand brushes these are the best!!</li>
    <li> These brushes load well and application is easy. There are many brushes that I think are duplicated, not really any brushes I would use to apply eye shadow. I though there would be a case to hold the brushes, at the very least plastic sleeves, but that&#x27;s ok. I would be nice to have had the brush type on the brushes. Nevertheless, the brushes are worth the small price you pay especially when compared to MAC and other single brushes.</li>
    <li> Supppper Soft! Amazing brushes! I woupd recommend them so much!</li>
    <li> love it soft bristles</li>
    <li> I do love these brushes very dense, all the large brushes are flat top though was hoping for variety. Smells terribly of chemicals kind of like paint I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the glue. Definitely clean the brushes before you use obviously but thyre good quality and cheap!</li>
    <li> They smelled horrible right when I opened. I left it outside for 3 or 4 days and it was somewhat ok. After a week or two like 3 of brushes fell off the handle. Again you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> The bristles are so soft and applied my make up as promised- very well! Especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Came in a neatly taped Amazon box 👍🏽&lt;br /&gt;They are absolutely amazing! The brushes are all in great condition, not all falling apart like the other reviews. (Even gave them a little tug) They don&#x27;t look cheap at all. At least not to me anyway. They are so soft, but still firm enough to get the job done well. Thanks so much!!😍😍 would absolutely recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, came sooner then expected!😁</li>
    <li> These Brushes are nice and soft, yet thick and full. Very well made and durable. Nice quality. I&#x27;m in Love. These brushed work great with M.A.C, Revlon and Maybelline Liquid Foundation.  I use all 3 of these.</li>
    <li> let me first say these brushes are aaamazing!! the quality reminds me of the sigma kabuki set (not exaggerating)  they&#x27;re affordable, great quality and easy to use. totally recommend this product and they keep up with you through email to make sure you received your package and are content with the product. :)</li>
    <li> I love this brushes they are well done.</li>
    <li> Pleased with these brushes. I&#x27;ve had them for a long time now and they haven&#x27;t ahead and hairs and have went through a few cleanings and remain the same. Will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Lots of brushes and very inexpensive!  Also, lots of loose hairs come out on your face while using.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product because who really needs this many brushes and who really feels like picking a bunch of loose brush hairs off their face?  Not bad for stippling if that&#x27;s your thing.  I now know I&#x27;d rather shell out the big bucks and get the quality Trish Mc Avoy brushes I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
    <li> This set really gets the jod done, if you&#x27;re not a pro, don&#x27;t really have time or money to spend on a thousand different make up sets and fancy brands, this is it. True, it does have a syntetic smell that can be quite strong, but it really gets the job done and I&#x27;ve got amazing results with these. Not a pro, the kind of girl that only wears make up on weekend nights? This is a set for you.</li>
    <li> They work so well! And they are so soft!</li>
    <li> Love this set!!!..very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I LOVE  THEORY BRUSHES!!! They are EXTREMELY  soft and gentle  on my skin. Thinking  about  buying  another  set...</li>
    <li> These brushes are not perfect…. but the price is fantastic and there are a zillion of them, so what the heck.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and glue the gold part in better.  So far, so good.  They are soft and do the job very well.  I do appreciate the quality of more expensive brushes, but really…. for the cost these cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes the only down side is that they unstuck rather quickly. One of them even arrived unstuck, but that isnt a major problem a little glue and BAMMM good as new. I will be repurchasing this item.</li>
    <li> they are absolutely perfect. So glad I bought them. The size is great.</li>
    <li> Great product,i really enjoy it.i would really recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> As Described, Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Lovely brushes! Soft and don&#x27;t shed!</li>
    <li> Honestly these are not even worth what they cost. They seem soft and all. But firstly brushes shed, secondly they don&#x27;t have the shapes like they do on picture. Angled brush barely has an angle. All the face brushes look almost the same except for foundation brush. Thirdly eye brushes are way too big for eye shadows unless you have giant eyes. I find they I can only use couple of brushes out of entire set. And for last some of my brushes came damaged with dents in the metal part, which changes the shape of bristles. I contacted the seller but no one got back with me. The brushes will also smell awful at first. And you will have to hot glue them all.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;The seller did get back with me and offered to resend brushes or get a refund which was really nice of them. One more star for customer service!</li>
    <li> These brushes are inexpensive, yet great quality and craftsmanship. I&#x27;ve researched similar brushes that cost several times as much and I&#x27;m really happy I didn&#x27;t waste my money. They haven&#x27;t shed and are very easy to clean. They maintain their shape and give a nice airbrushed effect. I plan to repurchase an additional set to travel with me.</li>
    <li> The brushes are weirdly long and it&#x27;s hard to get enough eye shadow on it in one go.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love these... synthetic brushes, the price is nice, but the fibers are falling out, without even using them.Maybe I got a bad set. The large brushes are the worst for this.</li>
    <li> Good Brushes! Very soft and high quality, the brush keeps its shape after many washes and they come in many different sizes.</li>
    <li> very nice set for the price.</li>
    <li> Very nice set, so many I gave some to a friend.  Good brushes!</li>
    <li> So far this brushes are my best foundation  brushes that I have bought.  They are so soft and easy to apply the foundation on. They are also really affordable to buy.  Easy to wash them.</li>
    <li> Great brushes to add to my collection. Haven&#x27;t had any shedding and they have held up great through&lt;br /&gt;a few washes already.</li>
    <li> As everyone else has reported, there is a chemical smell upon first opening the package.  I find that the odor dissipates after about two washes, however.  They blend makeup well enough, but the glue holding the brush head ferule to the handle is weak and I have had them separate after two washes.  Not a major deal breaker, as gluing them back on doesn&#x27;t take that much effort.  For the price, these brushes are quite a decent buy.</li>
    <li> Te bristles of the brush are amazing feels like professional make up brushes but this morning when I was using my foundation powder brush the top part came apart from the bottom sober not bad for the price</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes for such a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I order these brushes i have 4 sets but the last 3 sets i order they. All came very fast&lt;br /&gt;But the two i got yesterday. Had a strong. Smell and the ones i got today has a little smell but not nearly as strong as the first set. But. They came all in. Different. Packages and they are soft and thick.</li>
    <li> This set is wonderful for any kind of make up user, from experienced to beginner. These brushes are soft, pick up product well and very durable (no shedding-if used properly or a little rough I&#x27;m no saint when it comes to storing my brushes). This set is worth the money (and much cheaper than other brush sets out there) and are comparable to the more expensive ones on the market. I would recommend to every make up user out there!</li>
    <li> The brushes themselves are good for the price you pay. Would have rated 5, except that I received duplicates of 2 brushes, and didn&#x27;t receive any of the fine line brushes.</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes are the same size. Didn&#x27;t pay close attention before ordering. No liners included</li>
    <li> I bought these with the Dragon pad brushes and I am so happy that I did!  I  don&#x27;t have to buy expensive drug store brushes that don&#x27;t even come close.&lt;br /&gt;I know why you Tubers  are raging about these brushes they are really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for a wonderful products!!</li>
    <li> Purchased as gifts... well received, good quality.  Could use a case</li>
    <li> these are really good quality for the price...great for beginners :D</li>
    <li> Look and work like high end brushes-seriously. 10 brushes for less than the cost of one premium brush and they don&#x27;t shed, are super soft and look great.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait to see how these brushes worked for me before I reviewed these.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having them for about 4 months now.&lt;br /&gt;I find that I can&#x27;t really find NO use for the small brushes. They&#x27;re no good for blending eyeshadow because literally all they do is suck it all of up wipe the eyeshadow off. The small brushes DO work with concealer and sharp contouring though.&lt;br /&gt;As for the big brushes, I use most of them for foundation application, sometimes blush. I find the most use for the big brushes as apposed for the small.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a makeup artist so maybe that contributes to my lack of knowledge of how to use the small ones.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles ARE soft however, so that&#x27;s good if you have sensitive skin such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product, but not something I would buy more than once.</li>
    <li> Great quality and so cheap.. Very content with the brushes</li>
    <li> everything is everything!</li>
    <li> Super soft! No shedding on any brushes except one, but it was like 2 hairs.</li>
    <li> They came in perfect condition and are very soft. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes a while ago and I still use them. They work really well and they&#x27;re soft and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them yet. It doesn&#x27;t shed at all and it remains very soft. Nothing has broken. Still in good shape. And it was very cheap so that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> For such a cheap price, these are great brushes. I almost bought the Real Techniques core collection but decided to get these instead and I think it was a great choice. The brushes blend makeup well and are very dense in a good way.</li>
    <li> Excelent product I cant complaint. But it right now.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. The brushes are soft and doesn&#x27;t really shed that much. My only complaint is it broke off the handle after just two uses. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal as you can fix it with some krazy glue. Reasonable price for some okay brushes.</li>
    <li> Love them! Great quality and didn&#x27;t take long to ship!</li>
    <li> such awesome products!!</li>
    <li> Super soft. Work great. Love these</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ! Great quality. I would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes have a strong chemical smell to them but once they&#x27;re washed or aired out the smell goes away. The product its self is cheaply put together. My daughter hasn&#x27;t used these long enough to find out if they shed easily or not. However, she likes how soft they are and how long they are. She says that they are easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price. No sheading and very soft.</li>
    <li> Not a bad little set but the bristles are almost too flimsy for my preference.</li>
    <li> Strong chemical smell. Eye makeup brushes too thin.</li>
    <li> This item shipped quickly. It was just as advertised. These are synthetic so chemical smell was expected. I washed brushes twice and the smell is almost gone. Other than the smell the brushes apply powders very well.</li>
    <li> great for the pricea and made well.  very soft</li>
    <li> brushes did not work well at all</li>
    <li> Love them makeup applied evenly!</li>
    <li> great quality a must have</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! They work so well with all makeup. High end to drugstore. Will be using everyday. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The texture to these brushes is great, my favorites are the fluffy eyeshadow brushes , they&#x27;re great at blending the only problem I had was that my powder brush came off of its handle, but they&#x27;re great if you&#x27;re just starting with brushes.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes!!</li>
    <li> If I can give it zero star I will. The brushes smells like paint thinner and completely over takes my house. Even tho I wash the brushes twice and left it to air out in my basement for a month, the smell is just as strong as the day i got it. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Thank i love my brush</li>
    <li> very good quality brush for its price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft on the skin. My only complaint would be that the brushes don&#x27;t say what they are to be used for on them</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like these brushes. They seemed to thick. The smaller brushes where all about the same size as well. Too many brushes that don&#x27;t do anything different from each other.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping and super smooth too. My only problem is the chemical smell. Do you know how to get rid of it? Other than that it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> They are nice but they smell really bad like turpentine.  Hopefully the smell goes away.</li>
    <li> These shed and are a little on the thin side as far as density.</li>
    <li> Brushes looked beautiful but had a strong smell and the handles fell off after one use</li>
    <li> Sheds a bit but it is Good 👍</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect about these brushes, I read the reviews and decided to give them a try and I do NOT regret it at all!!  They are pretty soft the only thing I didn&#x27;t like it&#x27;s that the barrel comes loose pretty quickly but putting down crazy glue and wala!</li>
    <li> Before I bought these brushes I went through all the reviews and I have to strongly disagree with the negative reviews, although they do come with a strong chemical smell that&#x27;s nothing if you wash them before use. While washing them they did not come apart, for those who&#x27;s brushes did you have to be washing them wrong, do not wet the entire brush and NEVER wash any makeup brushes upside down that causes the glue to weaken causing the brush to fall apart. Anyway, I have not used them on my face yet but running them across my arm, they are the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned! I highly recommend these brushes they are very under priced for the quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes fall apart way too easily. I would return them if I could because they are just a cheap cheap cheap product.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these brushes!!! They are absolutely great for professional makeup for the price of non-high-end brushes. It applies beautifully and smoothly, I love how they feel. I&#x27;m so happy I settled for this much cheaper product (compared to the expensive brushes) and great at the same time.</li>
    <li> The brushes are amazing and very soft. Great buy! I absolutely love them. And work well for me. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing Set, Perfect Quality, I love them!&lt;br /&gt;The price is amazing, what a deal for the best package of make up brushes!&lt;br /&gt;I saw Acacia Brinley Using them also in her make up tutorial, just fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;love them so much!&lt;br /&gt;must BUY!!</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for over a month now and I think they are awesome! The face brushes are soft and there is very minimal shedding. The eye brushes are the same. All brushes are dense. My only issue is that the handles were slightly loose. I fixed them by using some super glue.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great brushes!</li>
    <li> I use them everyday, and I ca say that it was a great choice. I have had them for a year now and cannot complain. I might buy them for resale or presents for my friends in the future</li>
    <li> Punctuality was great and product is very good better than some of my expensive brushes. I&#x27;m very happy, that im ordering more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Good brush set for the price. Not a fan of some of the smaller ones, but the big ones do a great job.</li>
    <li> They are so soft and I love putting on my powders with the big brushes. The little brushes I use for eyeshadow and I love them also. I want to purchase just the small ones again because I find myself changing colors so often and I don&#x27;t want to clean my brushes.  I&#x27;m obsessed with how soft and dense they are.  They give me the flawless look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
    <li> When I received this package I was so excited that I gave a very positive review without putting this to use. It was my mistake, but I&#x27;m taking all of it down. If you don&#x27;t know much about brushes or even if you do, please read the reviews carefully before you put your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;1. It came with a weird factory smell, as soon as I opened the little package the smell was unbearable. Some of my brushes still smell.&lt;br /&gt;2. The thing about these brushes is that they are huge; the small ones are ridiculously huge there is no way you can put eye shadow with it, and if you have, it does not blend very well. If you think you can buy this set and use it for both face and eyes you are wrong.&lt;br /&gt;3. The big ones don&#x27;t seem to pick any product up. I was using my Rimmel Stay Matte powder wondering why the powder isn&#x27;t working, as soon as I used a different brush I saw the difference on my face.&lt;br /&gt;4. They are not very foundation friendly. I don&#x27;t use any heavy foundations, I only use light BB creams and it can&#x27;t even blend that well I was end up using my hands, not to mention the streaks.&lt;br /&gt;5. Tbh I don&#x27;t know the purpose of half of the brushes, I mean, what do they do?? What are they used for?? They give you some weird shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would have stopped me from buying this. I do not recommend and I will end up giving all of them away.</li>
    <li> Best foundation brush ever!!</li>
    <li> Amazing makeup brushes! I own a few sigma brushes and I can say that these are almost better then the ones I have. For the price you just can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  I have not used a lot of brushes before, but they are durable, apply makeup evenly, and feel great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This brushes are amazing.. Definitely buying some more.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I don&#x27;t give the 5 stars is because one came broken</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and you can&#x27;t beat the price! Only gave 4 stars though because the eye brushes hardly pick up anything. The powder brushes make it worth it however!</li>
    <li> loveeeee these brushes!! they are super soft and works great. even though i don&#x27;t know what some of these brushes are actually used for...... i love them nonetheless!</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes in the mail and they were supposed to come tomorrow!! IM SO HAPPY WITH THEM!! they are so so so soft and im obsessed with them! definitely 10/10!!</li>
    <li> I wish the assortment was better, but they work good.</li>
    <li> When I opened up the brushes they smelt like paint or sharpies. When it came time to use, the bristles came out very easily and doesn&#x27;t blend very well. They get the job done but takes some time.</li>
    <li> This Brushes are amazing!! very beautiful and I can compare them to the Sigma brushes !!</li>
    <li> These are great, not only are they affordable but I really feel the quality supercedes the price.  They are very soft, reasonably dense and they pick up product very well.  I definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> I got them in the Mail super fast.They do smell like paint a lot from the brush handle, but im sure  once you wash it, it ill go away.the brush heads are actually quiet smaller than I thought they would be, but overall they look really nice.Cant wait to try them out.One more thing, i got them delivered on a sunday, which is really cool, since i thought Sundays you dont get any mail :)</li>
    <li> These are great brushes but I&#x27;ve only had them a month or so and a few of the larger brushes have already started separating from the handles, but it does not prevent me from using them.</li>
    <li> These Brushes Are The Best!!</li>
    <li> The brush is very soft but the glue holding the brush on to the stick does come off. I had to use superglue to put it back together. This happened to  only the big brushes.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Brushes are very soft. Barely any bristles came out.</li>
    <li> These are very compatible to Sigma brushes :)</li>
    <li> Brushes are awesome , came on time. Of course one of the handles were coming off but super glue will help with that. Highly recommended for beginners in the make up scene</li>
    <li> OMG! This has to be one of my best buys on Amazon! Very good quality brushes would by again and again. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.. Brush sets at the cosmetics store will cost you at least five times this amount. As far as quality, the brushes bristles are firm enough to hold powder but soft enough that they do not irritate skin, and I would know. I have very very fair skin and it is easily irritated by cheap products. I get no irritation from these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only brushes these sets are missing are a kabuki brush and lip brushes. Every other brush you need to do your makeup is there including contouring brushes, eye shadow brushes, powder brushes, and blush brushes. I would honestly pay for the money I spent for this set just for the contouring brush alone. A great value that I definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I took a year of cosmetology classes and occasionally do makeup for special events such as weddings. This is definitely a set I would bring with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after having used these brushes a couple of weeks three of them have fallen off their handles. It can be fixed with super glue or a hot glue gun but I don&#x27;t appreciate having to repair a product less than a month after buying it. Still a good price, but be ready to break out the glue at some point. I likely won&#x27;t order this product or brand again.</li>
    <li> I just got mine yesterday a whole day early at that and they were just perfect I totally recommend this product. I&#x27;m so obsessed with these there so soft and cute .</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for, but the first day I used my brushes out of the pack one already broke. I guess the glue wasn&#x27;t so good and the top popped off three seconds into me using it. I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> Burned my face the first time I tried to use them, I advise you clean them very well before use</li>
    <li> they work really good, the only problem is that they are starting to break :(</li>
    <li> Several of the face brushes broke after just one or 2 uses. Decent brushes though</li>
    <li> beautiful and soft brushes and they dont shed- worth every penny!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing quality . I love them so much .</li>
    <li> Love them! Best 10 brushes you could buy honestly! There great face brushes I no longer use anything else but these brushes for my foundation! There super soft don&#x27;t shed at all either! They also arrived sooner than expected within a week. Perfect for someone that&#x27;s looking just for face brushes</li>
    <li> One brush was missing and the top of the brushes always fall off the handle</li>
    <li> There were many duplicates of the same brush. They were not all different but they are very soft and makeup goes on well with these</li>
    <li> surprisingly good quality for the price. Great dupe for Sigma brushes</li>
    <li> Nice inexpensive set. I only found use of maybe 5 of these brushes. The others were way too dense.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing for the price! I love how soft they are, and how smooth it is too blend my makeup with these brushes. The only thing that might be an issue is that the gold part kind of wobbles. But for the price, if it does later on come of I really don&#x27;t mind glueing it. Great product. Great price</li>
    <li> Bristles already starting to fall out but they are ok</li>
    <li> I like the brush, I wish there were labeled to tell you what type of brush they are.</li>
    <li> Even though these brushes are not off the high end, they are reliable and I use them everyday.</li>
    <li> Loved these brushes. What an amazing price for some great brushes.</li>
    <li> Very good brushes for the price. Very smooth, they do not cause any problems. Perfectly satisfied!</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice and soft.  I use the flat one to apply my makeup and it works great.  The smaller brushes are little large so getting into smaller corners of the eye are a challenge so I use other brushes that I have.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great. I waited until I&#x27;d used them for a bit and washed them to write a review. They feel really great against my skin and evenly distribute my makeup. They wash out really well too and the fibers still feel great after being washed. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice and high quality, although some brushes had a little bit of shedding going on. Still very content with my purchase and I use the brushes everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got bunk brushes or something, but all the handles on these brushes immediately fell off and the bristles keep falling out. I really don&#x27;t want to spend more money to buy a hot glue gun like another poster suggested to try and make these usable. I shouldn&#x27;t complain because the price is great, I guess this is a case of you get what you pay for. Next time I will buy different brushes.</li>
    <li> NOTE:  I purchased the Silver Black version of these brushes (still made by BS-MALL and sold by Sunlion Shop) found [[ASIN:B00KOW827M on this page]] (not the Golden Black ones listed here).  I&#x27;m simply sharing my review of the BS-MALL brushes with photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) I was happily surprised that none of the handles popped off while washing them.&lt;br /&gt;2) Even more happy that I think I saw only 1 bristle come out while I washed all the brushes. I will say I like that the bristles are a very nice quality. For synthetic bristles they are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;3) I previously had been using a MAC stippling brush that was black with white tips like these and EVERY time I washed it it would clean off the makeup and the water would turn blackish like the black dye was bleeding. I assumed this would happen with these if that happened for years with my MAC brush and NONE of these turned the water or my white towels black while they were drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Each brush was individually wrapped and I was astonished how much each one smelled like paint, I IMMEDIATELY washed them one by one, though the smell did go away after washing them :)&lt;br /&gt;2) The brushes take a lot longer to dry than most any brushes I have used. I was really surprised they did not dry over night even after squeezing them out with a dry bamboo paper towel. I even went so far as to hang them upside-down to make sure water wouldn&#x27;t sit in the metal base of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;3) I wish the eyeshadow brushes were a little more unique. These brushes are great, but they are pretty similar to each other. They all look like different variations of brushes I would use to blend shadows - all very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 handle came off but it honestly didn&#x27;t bother me - I just paid $18 for one eyeliner brush at Sephora the other day and so even if a couple of these brushes had problems (which they don&#x27;t) I still think they are a great set of brushes for such a low price. A little super glue and I went to hold them all and completely forgot which one I had just glued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I REALLY LIKE how well you can see the amount of product on the brushes - see pic with product on brushes. The picture to the right of the brushes with blush &amp; shadow on them is of the same 2 brushes just after wiping them off on a tissue with a little alcohol (not washed with soap &amp; water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase these brushes again or recommend them to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I recently got the [[ASIN:B0105NO4N0 BS-MALL(TM) 9pcs Premium Synthetic Cosmetics Eye Shadow Eyeliner Makeup Brushes Sets (9 Pcs Golden Black)]]  since I wanted more unique eye shadow brushes and these are a great addition to the set listed on this page.

    <li> I love them! So soft! Really good for the price</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great. They only think I would recommend would have the description of each brush printed on the brushes.</li>
    <li> Super soft. With time the handle off the brush will come off but you can easily glue it back together</li>
    <li> Perfect. I use them everyday</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Soft on the skin and I am able to apply makeup so easily. They don&#x27;t she&#x27;d hair, only letdown is that they can be broken pretty easily</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They&#x27;re very dense. My makeup goes on smoothly and blends well. Bristles are so soft. It didn&#x27;t have a strong smell when i just received it. Overall these brushes are comparable to high end brushes.</li>
    <li> Product does as stated.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good for the price!</li>
    <li> For the price, these are pretty unbelievable. Very soft, dense brushes. I am enjoying them very much. The small brushes are good for blending around the eye (and also to blend eyeshadow).</li>
    <li> Like the brushes!  Very useful!!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am very prone to breakouts so I needed to think of a better solution to applying my face make up than just using my finger tips and transferring the dirt and oils to my face. I purchased these and they are incredibly soft and gentle and felt really nice when applying my powder, blush and bronzer. Does a very good job at blending as well and easy to clean. Way too excited over this purchase and definitely suggest these brushes for anyone else.</li>
    <li> Great price for decent quality brushes, only complaint is that all the brushes look very similar once they arrive. These brushes are also very dense which I don&#x27;t always like for face makeup.</li>
    <li> They smell awful! I used them once this a.m., they seemed to work okay the smell is just awful when you open them.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes. Love the contouring brush.</li>
    <li> I love love love these brushes so much! I actually have two sets. The face brushes are all very good, even after multiple washes it dose not shed. The smaller brushes are not as good...the shape and everything just isn&#x27;t as useful. However the face brushes are all very nice and dense, will give a good bend for any type of foundation. I highly recommend have this set on hand if you&#x27;re a beginner. It will help a lot and so cheap!</li>
    <li> For the price you get pretty good quality.</li>
    <li> Definitely wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. The brushes were too large, not the handles but the actual brush part. And most of them were the same basically. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price</li>
    <li> Great brushes and fast delivery! Very nice costumer service, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY BRUSH SET. ALTHOUGH I WISH IT HAD A FAN BRUSH IN THE SET I STILL LOBE IT.</li>
    <li> Nice soft study  for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Very high quality and excellent product. Worth every penny and really fast great service!</li>
    <li> They are so soft and I didn&#x27;t get no hairs coming out</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes! They work just as good as sigma, and are sturdy, no fall out. I will definitely be ordering more !</li>
    <li> I tend to go with Amazon&#x27;s best sellers when purchasing a product and they never let me down. These brushes are great. I have a few expensive facial brushes from Bare Essentials and these are just as good.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price. I really didn&#x27;t expect much from these prices because they&#x27;re so inexpensive, however these brushes can definitely be compared to the expensive brands. I love them and highly recommend them. Received them quick. each brush is packed individually in plastic then bundled in a larger plastic. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> these are the softest brushes ive ever owned. They blend my makeup very well. Great with contouring, blushes, liquid foundation, bronzing, hilighting, anything on the face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cosmetic brush set and I must say, I&#x27;m VERY pleased!! There are a Variety of brushes to choose from. They look so nice in my Make-up box. It shipped quickly and arrived nicely packaged. This is a must-have!! I&#x27;m glad I purchased it....WILL be buying again.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  I love them</li>
    <li> I used only one of the brashes so far and it already broke on the second use</li>
    <li> Soft and works amazing .smells like sharpie for some odd reason</li>
    <li> Great weight, no fiber fallout, soft, dense and well constructed.  As with all new brushes, soak and wash with brush cleaner or baby shampoo.  The best advice I ever got about new brushes is to wash them really good.  Especially before they are ever used.  Smash them and give them a good workout.  Show them who&#x27;s boss.  Pounce them as dry as you can on a paper towel.  Leave upright to dry overnight.  Mine withstood a vigorous workout.  I still can&#x27;t believe I got this set for $15.  All I can say is if yours don&#x27;t do the same, have them replaced or request money back.  Mine are great!</li>
    <li> These brushes were an awesome addition to my kit! Super soft and amazing price almost to good to be true lol!</li>
    <li> The products is worth the money.</li>
    <li> The product is alright, haven&#x27;t used it much so I will update the review later on. It&#x27;s advertised as a 10 piece set yet I only received one.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth every penny. Love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Love my new brushes!! They are super soft.. Can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
    <li> The brushes is exactly what i had expected but one of the brush handle was crack ,it has a split on it ...and yes i will love to have the electronic guide on how to use each brush please as i said before i am satisfy with the brushes is just one came with a crack on the handle..</li>
    <li> The gold brush part needed to be hot glued onto the brush handle. They&#x27;re not super dense, but they work just fine, especially for a beginner like myself. Wish they came with an instruction guide for which brush you use for what! lol</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes look and feel amazing!!</li>
    <li> The brushes came in earlier and they were  well packaged  . The brushes were super soft and luckily they aren&#x27;t or have not been broken .</li>
    <li> Have yet to try them but they look amazing. Chemical smell but nothing too too bad :) excited to give them a try</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes. The bristles are soft  and the brushes have a great variety. I saw some people&#x27;s comment about the smell. Mine has a little bit but it didn&#x27;t bother me that much. To me, it&#x27;s more like a glue smell. So far, it works really well. I have yet to see if it holds together after cleaning them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They are so soft and nice and don&#x27;t feel cheap. They came three days after I placed my order and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the seller. The only downside was the packaging, some of the brushes were a little squished and messed up because the plastic was poking into them because but i managed to fix the bristles back to normal. They also had a very bad smell but I just gave them a nice wash and let them air out for a day and the smell was gone. Overall I would repurchase these brushes again.</li>
    <li> The travel case that it comes with is amazing because it has individual pockets for each brush, it makes it so easy to put in your makeup bag or just transfer to different places.</li>
    <li> I got these as a travel set to use as alternates to my tried-and-true Real Techniques brushes... and ended up actually preferring these more! They are so soft and dense, it&#x27;s unbelievable. To give you an idea, when washing these I have to rinse twice as long as my other brushes to get all the shampoo out, and they also take twice as long to dry... that&#x27;s how tightly packed the bristles are. Yet they&#x27;re soft as little chinchillas. Really a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed brush I find a bit awkward - too tapered for all-over application yet too large for precise usage. I prefer my Real Techniques blush brush, which is smaller. However, all the others I use daily. The large, flat tops are great for stippling on powder with a light hand, while the large rounded ones are perfect for buffing in foundation as well as blending out powders or creams. The small brushes work well for applying contour and highlight, or for blending out eyeshadow seamlessly - you&#x27;ll still need some finer brushes for crease and liner applications, but these are great go-to brushes for larger work around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful not to store them in tight containers for a long time or the bristles will get a &amp;#34;dent&amp;#34; in them until washed and reshaped - may seem obvious, but because these are so dense they seem a bit less forgiving/malleable than other brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a sort of introduction to the world of make up brushes, I&#x27;ve used it for a month now, face brushes daily and the eye brushes not so much which might explain why they&#x27;re in a better shape. One of the face brushes started shedding really bad and another was not glued together very well. These two are my bronzer and blush which are used more heavily. I can expect the rest to have a short span lifecycle which I guess is to be expected with the price tag. Overall 3 stars because they are soft and cheap.</li>
    <li> Great quality! The referrals stayed on and I have washed them several times and no shedding. Size wise they re smaller than other brushes and not as dense, but are very soft and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> They Are Really Nice Quality.. Fast Shipping.. really Similar To Sigma Brushes</li>
    <li> The reviews for these brushes claim to be professional status whereas I have found better brush quality from Elf. A brand you a can purchase at Target for under $3.  The quality is extremely cheap, the handle came off when examining the brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing so soft! They also arrived fast</li>
    <li> The actual brushes are ok but the handles are awful I had to relieve a few of them and they are brand new and Never used.</li>
    <li> Great quality brush. soft to the touch and easy to clean</li>
    <li> I was wanting firm brushes, these are not...</li>
    <li> great brushes i had my doubt when i orderd them but i was wrong they are great very soft and just amazing</li>
    <li> two of the brushes broke within three days!!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re indeed soft brushes and get the job done well, but my only dilemma with them would be that after washing them twice they began to get loose; The brush itself from the wooden stick wasn&#x27;t sticking anymore. Soo now I&#x27;m ordering a different pair and throwing these out.</li>
    <li> WOW. These brushes are simply amazing for the price. The handles do easily detach, but that&#x27;s easily fixed with any type of glue. As with all brushes, you must clean them regularly as to avoid splotchy application. I&#x27;ve had no issues with shedding and the variety of brushes that are included allows you to do a full face! The brushes come with a cute khaki carrying bag with ample room to store every brush. Get these brushes!</li>
    <li> Seriously awesome brushes! I&#x27;ve had them for about a month and they have not shed. They&#x27;re soft, full, and blend out my heavier Mac foundations beautifully. You must try it! For the price, this is an absolute steal</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic. A great option for a good price. They do have a chemical smell to them when you first get them, but it goes away as soon as you start putting them to use.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with these brushes. They are very soft  &amp; full, attractive  &amp; professional looking. Bought another set for a friend &amp; she is  very happy with them too. The price is great for this product.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and brushes are nice and dense.  I was leery of the quality buying them online but these brushes look and feel great.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, they are soft and durable. I have been using them for Bout two months and have had no issues ! Definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> They are my first set of brushes. It is to early to say how they will hold up, I will update that later however they are strong and soft. They are really pretty and handle very well.</li>
    <li> These are too stiff and rough.</li>
    <li> they are pretty good for cheap brushes!</li>
    <li> I think they should come with pamphlet to help you figure what each brush is actually can be used for. I love the brushes, just not a lot of detail with them.</li>
    <li> Came way sooner than expected, which was awesome. Decent set of makeup brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> Great quality especially for the price. I will be repurchasing! Fast shipping and no shedding in the 4th week!</li>
    <li> not a good quality set simply because the brushes soak up the color. I have to use my fingers to produce higher intensity look. I&#x27;m sorry but not a good cosmetic set</li>
    <li> The brushes were perfect especially for what the price was I would of paid more for them because the quality is amazing I have been using them ever since they got here and I&#x27;m in love.. You won&#x27;t regret buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure where any of the negative reviews are coming from.  These brushes are fantastic for the price.  The smell is there when you first get them, but went away quickly.  I have no complaints.  I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> the brushes are too large, I can&#x60;t use them to put eyeshadow cause they are too thick</li>
    <li> I love it!!...highly recommend</li>
    <li> I like it alot u should get it 😊</li>
    <li> I bought these in December and haven&#x27;t even used all the brushes . I love these! The hairs don&#x27;t fall out and keep their shape and are super soft !</li>
    <li> Love the variety of brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes weren&#x27;t quite as angled as the pictures indicate.  They were actually quite flat.  This is important because the angle clearly impacts how your makeup goes on and the accuracy of the application.  I kept them because for the price the brushes were soft and though they went be as useful as I will need they can still have some use. So if your looking for precision in your application don&#x27;t buy these.  If you are just looking for a couple of decent extra brushes then the purchase is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true about the smell but the brushes are sooooo soft and dense can see it&#x27;s perfect for each of their uses! And am I the only one that got 3 extra brushes from the 10 piece set ? Love !</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t just look like Sigma brushes, they pretty much are. The quality is INSANE for such cheap brushes; they&#x27;re soft, dense, and don&#x27;t shed. Fairly good handle weighting, too. My only small problem was a bit of a chemical smell, but one good shampooing and a day to air out and the smell totally disappears. I&#x27;ve been using them all- particularly the flat top and rounded kabuki- nonstop since I got them.</li>
    <li> No complaints, cheap, pretty, and soft. They are obviously not the best brushes, but work great. I would definitely buy these same ones again.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft. I didn&#x27;t have any problems. Good quality</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t ask for more from this product for the price. First impression right off the bat was the chemical smell. Although I was prepared for it, it took me by surprise. I was planning to wash them but after taking them out of their packaging and letting them air out for about an hour, the smell was gone. I popped the heads off and hot glued them for extra support just in case. These brushes are extremely soft and have no started shedding yet. I&#x27;ve only used them once so far but they pick up product pretty well and work great with my powder and cream products. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Only complaints are that they should check what they send a bit more and I also wish they could label them. I got 2 extra unusable brushes on my pack, I would&#x27;ve hated to have 2 missing instead. Other than that, I recommend this for the price, although it may be a bit of a gamble.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes , they have very nice handles and the brushes are very soft and silky like, I really like these!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes was a life saver they did not take forever to get shipped, I really needed the brushes to start school&lt;br /&gt;An they where very cheap to!!</li>
    <li> Looks great... work  really great and I even got more brushes actually.. thank you...</li>
    <li> These make up brushes are so soft and work perfectly. The handles come lose just super glue them back. I love these bad boys</li>
    <li> Cute I recommend it..</li>
    <li> Got these for my 14 year old daughter. She loves the brushes. They are soft and the quality is great.</li>
    <li> Soft and durable! Ordered from them several times, these are the only brushes I use. They work and they fit my budget. I gave one to my toddler daughter for her play make up set, and she likes to just tickle her face with the big brush because it&#x27;s so soft. Definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> Just like MAC brushes. Shipped very fast, get these brushes!</li>
    <li> OMG get it I love it ! They are just a bit small !! But if it&#x27;s your first time trying &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; brushes then go for it :)</li>
    <li> Love love love love love love</li>
    <li> I loved the brushes. However, it only took two days of light use for the handles to come off. Very disappointing. After reading all the good reviews of these I was a little too hopeful. Maybe it is worth paying the big bucks for good and durable brushes</li>
    <li> Love these brushes they came right on time.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made; tops of brushes consistently fall off the handles.</li>
    <li> Ok, first of all, this isn&#x27;t junk. These brushes have some weight to them. I used one on the same day and loved it. Very soft but firm enough to get a good spread. I used it with airbrush makeup. It is flawlessly awesome. You will not regret it. Great bargain with high quality...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they feel really soft and are a very pretty color.</li>
    <li> Love how soft these brushes are, but several brushes have come detached from the handles. This is easily fixed with super glue, but it&#x27;s annoying that I have to do that with a fairly new purchase.</li>
    <li> Quite satisfied with product and service.</li>
    <li> Okay, so first of all I ordered this &amp; it said 10Pcs which correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, means I should receive 10 brushes but sadly only received 8. I&#x27;m not here to rant on that because I truly do not care, just don&#x27;t misinform me like that. Anyways the brushes do come and a nice packaging and each brush is individually wrapped and the quality of the brush usually differs on different people experience. However, my brushes had extremely soft bristles and although there is a light plastic like smell I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be gone once I wash them. These brushes are slightly heavier them I expected and they are not breaking apart (I tugged on each brush once I got them) and there is no shedding happening (I also tried to tug some hairs out and nothing happened) besides the minor setback with the amount of the brushes I would say they&#x27;re very nice for just 10 dollars honestly! I would recommend but do be careful before purchasing and look more into the reviews!&lt;br /&gt;EDIT*** Okay so I&#x27;ve come to realize now that I counted completely WRONG and I do have all 10 pieces! Which only makes me happier, please do give this product a shot!</li>
    <li> The smell was very strong, like most reviewers said.  I soaked them for 2 days in the most fragrant soap/wash I could find.  However, while drying, the plastic on a few of the brushes cracked--I think from the wood expanding and soaking up water.  When I peeled off the plastic, I noticed the smell again.  I think its from the glue product they use.  The bristles are soft and thick.  These brushes are good for the prices.  I also purchased the Emax  brushes for a few dollars more.  Same bristles and all, however the smell is way less offensive.  I&#x27;d go with those if smell is an issue.</li>
    <li> Good quality and exactly what like the picture!</li>
    <li> I never knew that makeup brushed could feel this soft or apply makeup so smoothly.  I will be buying these from now on!  I love them</li>
    <li> They are very nice and they came in on time!!</li>
    <li> I love these. Great quality for the price. I&#x27;ve purchased a few different cheap brush sets and have been left extremely (though I wasn&#x27;t surprised) disappointed. They are dense, I haven&#x27;t had a problem with shedding. They apply make up (liquid foundation, powder, eye shadow) evenly and hold quite a bit of color.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a quality brush set but can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t want to spend big money on the expensive lines, these will work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend these for MUAs. Maybe beginner students because they do the job well enough.</li>
    <li> amazing dense and durable brushes!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cute and the small face brushes/eye brushes are decent..and for the price the big face brushes are sort of okay. But two or three of the big face brushes are not usable because the hairs (or whatever you prefer to call them) fall out in clumps. I tried using one of the brushes to put powder over my under eye concealer and a hair got into my eye. My eye is really red now and I still am unable to get it out :(</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Really soft and nice feeling.</li>
    <li> There was shedding with one eye brush when i first got the package and another eye brush had bent hairs. The brushes are still usable but they&#x27;re not my first pick. And one face brush broke when i dropped it. The handle fell off but i super glued it back together and it feels sturdy again. This is still a great purchase because the face brushes feel high quality and dense and i use them everyday as well as the eyebrushes. Nothing beats the price. Definitely recommend buying it</li>
    <li> Great bargain and decent quality considering the low price.  I have purchased worse for many times the price paid for this product.  As far as the chemical smell many reviewers had mentioned, it was faint and cleared up after cleansing the product before use.  I am extremely happy with this transaction.</li>
    <li> I love how it blends my foundation and powder perfectly</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, they are worth price, however wish they came in a case or something.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of these brushes, but didn&#x27;t want to pay MAC&#x27;s or Sigma&#x27;s prices. Honestly these are great brushes for the price. My only wish is that the foundation brush would be a bit shorter/denser.</li>
    <li> The brushes came in just three days after I ordered them and they are very good!</li>
    <li> At first I was a little skeptical about getting these makeup brushes at this price but when I got the product and used it, it was definitely worth it. Usually story bought make up brushes are 10x the cost of these brushes and their quality isnt as good, these brushes are extremely soft and feel great on my skin. I recomment it, especially for this great price!</li>
    <li> Receive them the second scheduled delivery day. They had a paint smell to them which my boyfriend pointed out but after rinsing them with my brush cleanser I couldn&#x27;t even smell it anymore. The brushes are soft but had a couple fall out and bristles that were sticking out which I had to cut to match the rest of the brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheap alternative to brushes like Sigma. The brushes have a strong chemical scent but they went away quickly. The brushes are very soft and decently dense. But I do find that the brushes are &#x27;wobbly,&#x27; meaning the metal part isn&#x27;t glued very well to the wooden part. But this can easily fixed by separating the two parts and supergluing it back. But the set was a good deal. The brushes don&#x27;t have labels on them unfortunately so I had to go back on the site to look at what they were used for but I kinda use them however I want them anyway so its not a big deal. My favorite are the oval shaped brushes.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product! The brushes are are so soft and they help blend makeup perfectly. Will definitely  purchase again!</li>
    <li> The brushes give you full coverage and are very soft. The flat kabuki brush is very dense and works well, however it started to shed after I cleaned it the first time (just over a week old).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hit or miss with these brushes.  Some are great and the others are terrible.  The only one that I truly adore is the round brush for foundation.  the others give me trouble.</li>
    <li> the brushes are dense so they pick  up product well and allow you to use less. they are also extremely soft and have no fall out hairs</li>
    <li> Brushes are beautiful.  They are full and soo soft. And applying makeup never felt soo dream like.. these brushes are and great steal for the price !!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! super soft and they came faster than I expected</li>
    <li> I have to say that these brushes are phenomenal! They&#x27;re soft, dense, uniformly cut, and sturdy! I know that some reviews mentioned that the gold part of the brushes were not glued on properly, but I did not have any problems with that! Other reviews also mentioned that the brushes smelled bad. The brushes did have a chemical smell when I unwrapped them, but the smell goes away very quickly once they are exposed to the air, and for the very affordable price, I can overlook that! If I didn&#x27;t have such a horrendous experience with shipping, I would have given this product a full five stars, because I have no other real complaints. However, I recommend purchasing these brushes from a different seller, as it took forever for the brushes to arrive even with prime. There are a variety of sellers offering these high quality brushes for a very fair price, I recommend purchasing them!</li>
    <li> VERY disapointed in the quality, they sent me a set that did NOT containe the set stated.</li>
    <li> Very good quality brushes for both face and eyes. They are well made and sturdy. I love how soft and how kind to my skin they are. My foundation goes on seamlessly for an airbrushed look. My eyeshadows go on easily and I can control the intensity of color. Highly recommend and the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes!! I have bought more to give as gifts!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Mainly receiving it fast.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes ! The blend out my makeup so flawlessly . Must Buy!</li>
    <li> The brushes are not very steady. Will not last long. Good for travelling. I needed it for my vacation. For the price it works very well.</li>
    <li> Amazing material and adorable price</li>
    <li> They are ok. Decent price for those trying to save money or be frugal. they work well enough, but three arrived with handles broken and hot gluing and putting back together was not as easy as one reviewer mentioned. They are soft, but really not even close to MAC quality.</li>
    <li> Love! So soft yet firm</li>
    <li> Great brushes but the bottoms are not on tight you have to use a glue gun, good as new after.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Eyes&amp;#34; brushes are a little bit to big for me but, you know, it works for concelear or blending. :)</li>
    <li> As soft and sturdy as sigma brushes. Love every single one of them.</li>
    <li> Jeez....from $7.60 to $11 well....at least they&#x27;re worth it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these! They are waaaaaay better than I expected ♡</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for less than a month and two already broke. If you plan to use on the daily, try something more expensive but of better quality.</li>
    <li> I give them to my family and they like them</li>
    <li> Bristles are decent quality but the wood and the metal part of the brushes are not very well attached. About 60% of my brushes came apart</li>
    <li> These brushes are SO SOFT. Yes they are synthetic which is best for liquid makeup and blending because they don&#x27;t soak up your makeup. I just got them so i didn&#x27;t use them yet. no loose hairs, no shedding nothing, Vibrant gold and black brushes. with a grayish/white tips to the brush. They do have this strong/weird smell when you first open the package but who cares just wash them before you use like your supposed to. I will be buying more brushes once i figure out ways to use all of them.</li>
    <li> They work good. But the gold is a nasty ugly gold.  It looks so cheap.  If you want them to look decent or mock a high end look. GO FOR THE SILVER. YOU WONT GO WRONG.</li>
    <li> These brushes are like professional brushes without the shockingly huge price tag. Most people can afford these, and they are absolutely fantastic for the price! I use some of these every single time I do my makeup. I am a makeup lover. I would recommend these to anyone who loves makeup!</li>
    <li> great quality for the money.  so many brushes in this set</li>
    <li> Very nice quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Great quality at such an affordable price, I have only one complaint the handles on the brushes seem to come loose quite fast, but its nothing that some Krazy glue cant fix :)</li>
    <li> They are so soft. Make luring how to put on makeup so easy.  Downfall one of the brushes broke but I used some super glue and it worky fine</li>
    <li> Not satisfied because the brushes are separating, held together with a weak glue. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes. I was very happy about that.</li>
    <li> I HONESTLY LOVE THESE BRUSHES. i am going to buy these for my mom now, i recommend them!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes!! For the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought these. They work well and they are good quality. I was leary at first, but I made the purchase anyway. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> Grrat brushes but the bristles are falling out in chunks on one of them.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes and had fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> Nice brush set for the price! The brushes are so soft and work nicely for makeup application. Shipping was fast and well packaged. They are good quality for the price unlike some brushes I&#x27;ve purchased and they look and feel like more high end brushes. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described. Soft, durable and versatile!</li>
    <li> Just received these in the mail and I can&#x27;t believe what great quality they are! They are an amazing dupe to Sigma brushes. Super soft bristles but very dense. I was hesitant about the fake smell but after talking to a few people who&#x27;ve owned high end brushes, it&#x27;s normal. Haven&#x27;t tried them yet but I&#x27;m excited!!</li>
    <li> I loved these. Only issue is the brush splits into pieces because the glue wears out.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price. I see brushes of this quality for $6 a brush all the time.</li>
    <li> These brushes are just fabulous. I have never used sigma brushes before so I cannot comment on the comparability, but I do know that after purchasing these I don&#x27;t eve want to spend the money on sigma. Not to mention that they look absolutely gorgeous on my vanity. These would be great for anyone especially beginners.&lt;br /&gt;Large round and flat kabuki are great for buffing foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Large round angled kabuki is great for cream blush and bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;Large flat angled kabuki great for blending out blush and bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;Large round pointed kabuki is great for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;all the miniature versions of the brushes I use for concealer and the are also great&lt;br /&gt;all in all great price, great brushes</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price, I&#x27;ve been using them for several months and they&#x27;ve held up well. It came with so many,  I didn&#x27;t need all of them so gave a few to my Aunt.</li>
    <li> Horrible leaves streaks when you apply on liquid foundation</li>
    <li> I only received nine of the ten brushes after checking. Besides that the brushes are great..</li>
    <li> Brushes are so soft I used them in my makeup tutorial YouTube :Theallimajj</li>
    <li> Great value - quality was totally adequate for this price!</li>
    <li> I already order this set on my husband&#x27;s account and that&#x27;s why I order this again is for a gift for my friends birthday and hell yah!! This is the best as in The Best brush I ever had and guess what It&#x27;s cheaper and when you wash them its smooth. By the way I wash it using baby shampoo.... So smooth just like new... I know ny friend will loved it..The packaging is perfect very well pack just to make sure the brushes stays on its way...I love the brushes..This is my 2nd time brought this brush!!</li>
    <li> Brushes are awesome! They get the job done!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Sturdy brushes and soft bristles.</li>
    <li> After using they fall apart</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with these makeup brushes. These brushes are very inexpensive; however, they don&#x27;t do the best job with makeup application. The brushes can shed a little, they are also impossible to clean and the handles on two of my brushes have come off within a few months. If you are looking for good starter brushes these are OK; however, if you are looking for something that will last a long time and are comparable to professional quality, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> These are ok. Could be better</li>
    <li> They came way earlier then it said which was good. When I first opened the package up it stank of chemicals but after some washed the smell was gone. The brushes are really good quality and I&#x27;m super happy of how they work .</li>
    <li> These are great brushes, work well and are worth the asking price, the only problem was I received my order with a broken brush. Although when I emailed to explain my issue, an email was sent back to me within the next day and I am now waiting for a replacement :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so soft!! I like it! Wish the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; brushes were smaller but over all, I like it!</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes I had to get creative what to use it for but it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t shed!</li>
    <li> 2 of the brushes were broken</li>
    <li> Awsome! My friend loved them! But they stink</li>
    <li> It could be a Little more firm,but over all its not bad it was 7$</li>
    <li> These brushes are so wonderful and sleek and I love them. The price is great and shipping doesn&#x27;t take too long. I wish the bristles of some of them are sliiiiightly softer but the foundation brush and the smaller brushes are amazing. I recommend this to anyone who needs beginner brushes and still testing things out.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes. Soft and the bristles don&#x27;t come off when used.</li>
    <li> I am sooo happy with these brushes! I will admit that I was somewhat afraid to purchase these because of the mixed reviews and simply the price, I thought it was too good to be true but I&#x27;m so glad I ended up buying them. They did smell kinda funky when I first got them but I did wash them before using them. They apply my makeup flawlessly and I highly recommend these brushes and you defiantly cant beat the price!</li>
    <li> Really nice quality. Very soft brushes, very thick and dense. Better than drugstore brushes, almost on par with MAC and Sigma. I think they&#x27;re just not quite as dense as MAC and Sigma, but they work just as well. The difference isn&#x27;t going to show on your face.  Can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price. I&#x27;ve washed them a couple times-- I&#x27;ve had no shedding at all. I mainly use the kabuki brushes (flat top, angled). The eye brushes are a bit big for the eye, but you can use them around the face and around the eyes, depending on your eye shape.</li>
    <li> I bought these because one, the price is fantastic . And two, I have makeup brushes from Bh cosmetics that look exactly like them-only difference is the gold is lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there were more bristles in them personally because I like the stiffness, but then again these ARE inexpensive so you get what you pay for :)&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box it smelled like the factory right away. I washed them tho and let them sit over night... They still aren&#x27;t dry lol I&#x27;ll upstate this later when I can use them</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They do come with a weird smell but after a good wash with your face wash it goes away. They&#x27;re so soft yet efficient. I will be buying some more soon.</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft! Really good quality!</li>
    <li> Nice brushes with smooth finish. Buying another to keep in makeup bag</li>
    <li> Wow!  What an incredible deal.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but these brushes are really soft.  The few brushes I own are make by ShuUemura and I like these better.</li>
    <li> Adore. I love how soft they are.</li>
    <li> Soft and easy to use. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very soft, great for blending your highlight and contour. Some brushes are longer than they need to be. Specifically the smaller blending brushes for the eyes and precision blending. But they work fine. Great addition to my makeup kit. Good value.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and was hoping for the best.  Nope, these are not good brushes.  You know the type makeup brushes that tear up your powder and the powder drops off them  or the eyeshadow goes on your cheeks as well as your eyelids?  The makeup doesn&#x27;t cling to the brush?  Well if you like that, then these are the brushes for you.  They feel like nylon.  These went into the garbage.</li>
    <li> Best brushes! Good Quality too</li>
    <li> shed a little but they are SO soft. love them!</li>
    <li> is an excellent seller, I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> The quality is excellent! These are very soft and do a great job blending foundations, concealers, and cream shadow. Definitely a much cheaper dupe for Sigma. So worth the price!</li>
    <li> Came well packaged, no funny smell ...Brushes are soft and I use baby shampoo to wash them LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> Ok products . Smell a little bit.</li>
    <li> Fabulous brushes and great price! I would definitely recommend. Love that they came with the brush cleaner is a plus.</li>
    <li> The brushes were great at first, but the brushes started coming off.</li>
    <li> For the price, its amazing. They never shed nor breaks. Its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Shipment was fast . Brushes are really nice and soft . I love them</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat them for the price. A tiny bit smaller than I expected, but nice density.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great value, very soft.</li>
    <li> Cheap and definitely cheap quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a lot larger than I anticipated</li>
    <li> I Wouldn&#x27;t recommend these pretty much all my brushes have come apart already.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes because I wanted a set that was cheap. But I didn&#x27;t want them to look/feel cheap. These feel like expensive makeup brushes. The price is unbeatable. I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> these are great. although they did have a bit of a chemical smell to them but after giving them a first wash they are really nice brushes to use</li>
    <li> Super texture,  lush natural feel.</li>
    <li> Had one week, one brush already came apart.  Will try to glue but for the price it was expected.</li>
    <li> Love these. I got this as an impulse buy because I needed One Kabuki brush and this whole set was the same price as one brush so I decided to take a jump. So glad I got this! These are dense brushes that make blending, contouring and highlighting very easy. They are the perfect size, not too big and not too small and they seem to be well built. I was nervous about shedding as one reviewer had bad luck with the synthetic hairs falling out but nothing to report on my end. I&#x27;ve used 3 of the brushes so far pretty heavily and no shedding. Love these and am glad I purchased them! Buy them!</li>
    <li> Really really love these brushes, Expecially for the price. The face brushes seem of more quality than the eye brushes though</li>
    <li> This is honestly one of the best cosmetic purchases I have ever made! These are great quality brushes, and at this price it&#x27;s a STEAL!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for these... people said that their is a glue/lacquer thinner smell when they first come out of the box. But the brushes do the job and the scent quickly fades.  The only thing is that after a few weeks of use, the gold barrel of the brush came unattached from the black handle.  Easy fix though, I used gorilla glue to stick them back on, which is probably ten times stronger than the original glue that twas on there. Now the handles won&#x27;t be coming off any time soon.</li>
    <li> The metal part broke off after a while but other than that they good.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes! I just wish that the brushes were a larger variety and that the face brushes were a bit bigger. I find myself only using 3 out of all the brushes and gave the rest to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great Brushes! Very Soft!! Shipping came way eariler than expected! Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of course as everyone as I hate scams. But OMG! When I recieved these it felt like I was drooling over candy! I don&#x27;t want to exaggerate but over this price I will! Every dime I spend hurts lol but this did not hurt I have absolutely no regrets! I have good quality brushes like real techniques and this is almost better! I love it!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these brushes but they seem to wipe my makeup off and not apply powder blush and pressed powders very well. I did be careful to use them gently, i very lightly fluffed them onto my blush, noticed it had easily picked up enough brush, then i attempted to apply the blush onto my cheeks but got very little transfer of blush, I picked up more blush and attempted again but then noticed some removal of my color stay foundation! When i tried to apply my face powder I noticed not coverage on my shine areas it just stayed on the bristles and didn&#x27;t transfer. After a few attempts I got frustrated and got out my regular brush which easily covered the shine. I haven&#x27;t tried the eye brushes yet but will see if they work any better. Im still experimenting with different techniques and make up. Im not at all a pro so these may work better for others but I&#x27;ve gone back to my bundle monster brushes. They just work better for me.</li>
    <li> AMAZING quality! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great quality and and amount of brushes for the price. They arrived faster then expected and are super soft brushes. My brushes don&#x27;t seem to have any smell to them like other people have mentioned. I would highly recommend these brushes!!</li>
    <li> Got delivered SO fast!  :) really happy</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. When i open ..the hair  come off. .and also  the  glue  just not  stayed</li>
    <li> In love with these. They are sooo soft, thick and dense! Very very similar to my sigma brushes but I love thesw even more and got in the mail within two days of ordering! ;) best deal ever! Thanks</li>
    <li> These brushes are god like. They are amazing. I might buy some more just because they are that good.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these brushes, they are perfect for beginners and professionals. No shedding with these brushes. These brushes are amazing, they are soft and thick. These are my everyday brushes, great price and fast shipping. I love this brush set.I would recommend this Kabuki set.</li>
    <li> I actually think the bristles of the brushes are very soft, but what good is a brush if its falling apart? The glue that holds ferrule to the handle is extremely cheap and you can tell that the brushes aren&#x27;t of great quality. I chose to keep them since I did already put them to use so I will just buy some crazy glue and hope that it sticks. Other than that, I washed the brushes with shampoo when I first got them and the bristles remained soft and the original fake smell did disappear. Honestly I do like the brushes I am just mad they every time I use one, its starts to shake or the handle falls on the floor.</li>
    <li> I must say I am very impressed with the quality of this brush I was about to spend around 400 on sigma brushes but this totally change my mind they are amazing</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price! Cant beat it!</li>
    <li> soft and easy to apply!</li>
    <li> I recommend this brush set. This is my 3rd set of brushes, and my favorite! They fit my budget, I didn&#x27;t have to wait a long time for them and work really good.</li>
    <li> Wifey loves em. Feels like the pro&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> For the price, they&#x27;re of good quality and get the job done</li>
    <li> Putting on makeup has never been this easy! Because I have a complete set of these brushes I can now put my makeup even better and faster than before! Even if you are a newbie to applying makeup you can never go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very high quality.  I have had literally NO shedding, and they are full and lush.  They are not cheaply made.  Sometimes the gold piece on this type of brush is not well-attached and appears cheap...not so with these brushes.  A very good buy.</li>
    <li> Smell on the brushes was horrible!! But they work great and came at a great price.</li>
    <li> the brushes are pretty good their good for powders not so good for liquids and they did have a chemical smell to them but they are exactly as described and super soft</li>
    <li> Good bargain. They do have a funky smell, but it didn&#x27;t deter me from using &amp; abusing these brushes!</li>
    <li> I ordered them Wednesday &amp; they arrived 2 days later. My package accidentally came with 2 extra brushes😁🙌🏻 thank you company btw. They do have a strong smell to them, and even after a couple washes it was still there. Besides the smell they&#x27;re amazing!! They&#x27;re super soft &amp; they aren&#x27;t anything like the cheap brand brushes that are harsh on your face. I highly recommend these brushes for only $10!?! Who says no to that! The last 2 on the right are the extra ones that tagged along.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Cheap but well worth it. I do makeup professionally and OMG they are so helpful!!! Great Buy don&#x27;t hesitate!!</li>
    <li> They arrived earlier than expected, which is good. They look and feel good, however I ordered gold brushes not silver. Oh well :/</li>
    <li> Amazing makeup brushes! Would definately order again!</li>
    <li> This brusher are really good! The price is awesome and the quality of the brushes is surprisingly really good! They are firm and apply really well. As of now I have only used the bigger brushes for my face makeup, and a small flat end brush for concealer. I am really happy with this purchase and will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes . They are so soft and they remained that way after I washed them to get ride of the factory smell. They also do not shed which is great. These brushes are much better than my Expensive ones and better for my bank account .</li>
    <li> The handles on these break super easy. I just super glued them back together. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, Amazing quality and the price is great. It does come with a weird smell at first but once you let them sit out it goes away. These brushes are great for foundation and contouring. Would repurchase.</li>
    <li> The smell is awful, but they work great</li>
    <li> I ordered the black and gold set. I received to duplicates in my set, one in the larger brushes and one in the smaller brushes. These brushes have been great for the price.I absolutely adore the two large angle brushes and they do an excellent job with blushes and bronzers. The flat top brush is good for liquid foundation, but I find myself reaching for my previous foundation brush because this one is not as full as I would like it to be. The two rounded top small brushes are good for large applications of eyeshadow, but I rarely reach for the other two. I only use about half of the brushes from this set, but for the price if I had only found one I liked it would definitely be worth it. I haven&#x27;t had any quality issues with the brushes, no shedding and no problems with the handles becoming loose. I would recommend washing these brushes before use, but be aware that they will take a long time to dry due to their density.</li>
    <li> Good applicators. Work well for the price</li>
    <li> Love it! Super soft!!!</li>
    <li> Love these. I have never used brushes before and originally bought a cheap set to see if I wanted to switch. I like the brushes enough that I went ahead and upgraded to this set. I love them. They are soft as can be, but yet strong enough to hold up to the applications.</li>
    <li> Not what I had hoped for. Cheap feel to them.</li>
    <li> They are very good quality and are at a great price.</li>
    <li> Wow you see the price of these brushes and think , well they can&#x27;t be that good.....YOU ARE WRONG... THESE BRUSHES ARE AMAZING</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these brushes.  Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Very cheap brushes. Handles fell off after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Package came earlier than expected so I was thinking to give this a 5 star but when I opened the package some of the brushes are badly dented.. So the bristles are misshapen. I&#x27;m really disappointed since reading the reviews of other buyers this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. Very dense and soft.</li>
    <li> These brushes are seriously just like a sigma brushes!The difference is so minimal that you bearly can tell! These aren&#x27;t numbered though so if you want your brushes to be numbered you can simply go onto sigma website and with a sharpie write it down on them which one is which.&lt;br /&gt;I waited to post this review quite some time as I wanted to see how they will hold up after a few washes and let me tell you they are still as good as they were when they originally came!no bristles came out ever!a lot of people are complaining about the smell of the brushes..Yes at first they smell but after a wash smell disappear...my question to some of you that used these without washing..wouldn&#x27;t you want to wash your brushes anyway before you apply with them your make up???ANY brush should be washed before use ;Mac sigma or this one...NEEDS TO BE WASHED REGLARDLESS as any Bush comes with bacteria/dirt  on the bristles once you purchase  and you want to use clean these brushes when you apply your make up that way your skin won&#x27;t break out etc.</li>
    <li> Items arrived, can&#x27;t wait to use.</li>
    <li> Handles become loose and detaches. The brush hairs are good enough quality though.</li>
    <li> The quality is great for the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re soft and look good.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would have come with more flat brushes for eyebrow or lips. But I had mine for over 6 months and they&#x27;re still working great!</li>
    <li> Brushes are super soft and definitely a great deal for the price. Does not shed.&lt;br /&gt;All brushes had a pretty strong chemical smell when I first opened it, but the smell is gone after cleaning them with a makeup brush cleanser a couple of times.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok until one of my brushes handle came off</li>
    <li> Very satisfied  with product and delivery.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> My three daughters said thank you so much for these Brushes. Could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Great value for good brushes.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try these, however they were delivered to the wrong address and there is no way for me to receive a refund. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> These have been WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> These are good brushes for the price. IT Cosmetics charge $35.00 for one brush. Can&#x27;t tell much difference with these brushes verses high end. Too Faced Cosmetics brushes are ok good but cost 10 times the amount and do the same thing. Don&#x27;t be fooled for the name brand. I paid high dollar for a IT cosmetics no tug brush and it still tugged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m literally IN love with these brushes! And the set says 10 but I got 12. They&#x27;re so soft, and the handles were not falling off for me; they were in perfect condition. I am the biggest make up junkie out there so these brushes really were worth it! I love them, honestly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are strong quality brushes. I have seen brushes for a lot more money and the quality was sub-standard. These brushes will last a long time. They do not shed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> 4 of them were broken when I got them they don&#x27;t seem to be glued together well but the actual brushes are nice and don&#x27;t shed or tangle when washed and they keep shape. I ended up buying the elf studio brushes for everyday use since these brushes seem fragile but I kept a few of them in my collection.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re awesome! Super soft, they work well, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The only cons I have are that the handles tend to fall off but that can be fixed easily with some super glue and the scent of the brushes is very strong when you first receive but it will go away shortly. Just let them air out.</li>
    <li> Honestly, these are the best makeup brushes I&#x27;ve used in a while! So soft and amazing! Easily comparable to the higher end brushes that are much more money! Being a make up artist myself, I can say that these brushes are amazing on both myself and my clients. Also great for beginners!</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes for the price. They aren&#x27;t harsh on the skin either!!</li>
    <li> This product is really great with liquids and powder, really awesome! But after a couple weeks, the brushes started to shed and the top gold part of the brush handle started to break off also, so I was disappointed. To fix it I used super and hot glue.</li>
    <li> these brushes are awesome. The price is unbeatable for the quality that you&#x27;re receiving. I actually ordered a second set for my daughter. The brushes do have a synthetic scent when you first get them, but like EVERYONE SHOULD BE DOING WITH ALL BRAND NEW BRUSHES, WASH THEM! Once they&#x27;re washed the smell gone and they really do help you achieve an air brushed finish. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I love them. They work just as well as Sigma Kabuki sets.. no shedding either. I have ordered 2 sets and planning to order another set for my sister!</li>
    <li> such good quality and thick /so many for so cheap</li>
    <li> Goodness are these brushes amazing. Very very similar to the sigma brushes and a fraction of the price. Simply amazing these brushes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to be in the mail this soon so I&#x27;m really happy about that. Over all from looking at the brushes they seem like good quality and are VERY soft! I&#x27;m excited to try them :)</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes. Holds makeup well. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if the brushes were actually labelled.</li>
    <li> Seldom do I write reviews but I honestly want to save someone the time &amp; disappointment. 1st the brushes are indeed pretty when they arrive but they have a strong chemical order which is pretty scary since its for your face. I had to soak it in brush cleaner to remove the smell &amp; let it air dry for a day. When that was done I tried to use one of the brushes and the handle fell right off. I started examining the other brushes and they are all not sturdy. So if you want a pretty looking brush then you can settle for this but other than that its not good.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are super soft and very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. My daughter loved them</li>
    <li> Nice brush set; however, some of the brushes look exactly alike!</li>
    <li> The eye brushes are too large to do anything specific at all. Moreover, though synthetic, they suck up more products within themselves instead of putting the colors I desire and do not blend easily. It&#x27;s cheap, so I&#x27;d only recommend buying these for emergency uses.</li>
    <li> ...bought for my 13 year old daughter. She loves them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are stiff at first. Once you use them they are really great!</li>
    <li> Totally surprised. Better than expected and I&#x27;m in love with them.</li>
    <li> For the price these brushes are amazing. I love them.</li>
    <li> the bristles started coming off by the hundreds after the first use, not recommended.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of these brushes.</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets and each set was missing product. Was listed as a 10 brush set and I received 7 brushes in one set and 9 in the other, very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good quality! Very soft ! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes! Very fast shipping! Blending perfect!  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> For the price, these are excellent!! I have washed them several times already and they are as good as ever. I love them and they are super soft. I would recommend these to anyone, especially if you are building your brush collection. I am amazed at the quality for this price!</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft and allows for easy application definately a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes! High quality. Low price!</li>
    <li> Brushes are great...haven&#x27;t shed on me</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I just started getting into contouring and this set works so well. I previously bought shany brushes and they suck. No bristles fall out and their so soft and they don&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough about this brushes, they&#x27;re so soft! the makeup applies really well and the price is incredible. The smells goes away right after you wash them. I have to say their my first set of brushes, I guess there are better ones out there, but for me they&#x27;re great, and you can&#x27;t beat the price :)</li>
    <li> Had funny smell when I opened them, but I wash all new brushes before using. Once washed the smell was gone. Nice brushes, they don&#x27;t shed and get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great value!! Good quality and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes. Good quality and heavy, not like those cheap ones you get elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great brushes and seller</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for foundation... love them!</li>
    <li> Next best thing to my MAC pro brushes. I&#x27;ve used some of the most expensive brushes and i have to say these are amazing! The only thing I ahte about these almost perfect brushes is that the chemical smells.That&#x27;s why I gave you 4 stars!</li>
    <li> Very nice and good products for the price paid.</li>
    <li> Great brushes but some of the bristles fall after a while</li>
    <li> This was my first international order so I was somewhat skeptical when reading reviews, however these brushes are amazing! My order came in exactly 6 days! When I opened the package, there was a faint smell of chemicals but it&#x27;s simply because of the package, not the brushes. I recieved all 10 brushes, and the quality was better than I had expected. The bristles are soft and pretty dense. The color however looks more like a bronze/almost orange color, instead of gold, so beware. The only small issues that I have include the small pointed brush feeling a little stiff and about 2 hairs/bristles being loose, but no problem! This is my honest opinion and personal experience. If you&#x27;ve been wanting to buy these brushes, I suggest giving them a try!</li>
    <li> I like these. They work beautifully and I didn&#x27;t have issues with mine falling apart and I have had them for 2 or 3 weeks now. Maybe the people experiencing that received &amp;#34;bad batches&amp;#34; . They blend product well and they are super soft. My only compliant is they aren&#x27;t as dense as I would like them to be. But for less than $10.00 I can deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For anyone who is having issues with these and would like better quality, but not at simga prices try Morphe Brushes. They are better to me than Sigma when it comes to the quality of the brushes.</li>
    <li> These are perfect! Every brush you could possibly need is here and the quality is better then I expected..</li>
    <li> fall apart after cleaning..</li>
    <li> Really like these brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Honestly kinda new to brushes not sure what brush to use for what but everything went on great.thanks</li>
    <li> Gives me the best coverage possible. I&#x27;m just an amateur to applying makeup but these brushes help me blend and apply makeup big time.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. Soft but way smaller than how  they appear.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great brushes</li>
    <li> I recieved my brushes today... earlier than what i was expecting. They do a have smell which i dont mind. After reading the reviews i was hesitant about it but i wanted to jessup brushes to try out because i saw positive things about the brushes especially the big pointed rounded dome brush so i wanted that brush in particular by itself but i am really pleased. I pulled on each brush to see if it was loose or shaky and none of them were not. They are supperrrrrr soft. I received all of my brushes. the quality is worth the price. i am really happy. They didnt shed when i pulled the hair either so i cant wait to use these brushes. I will recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Nice soft brushes... Why pay more?</li>
    <li> A very good buy, you can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality on my 2 sets is really nice.  I experienced no loose heads or pulling off from the handles, the brushes wash and dry nicely.  There was a chemical smell when opened but that dissipated quickly and gave them a quick wash (I just used a small amount of baby shampoo).  No loose bristles as some have noted.  A solid purchase all around.  They feel nice in the hand and the length of the brushes works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached are the suggested use guide and my own 2 picture of the brushes next to a measuring tape so others can see the handle length.&lt;br /&gt;The guide tells you suggested uses but of course you will find your own uses as well.  I purchased 2 sets which gives me a good aount of brushes to use throughout the week before cleaning is necessary.The larger tapered brush is terrific for under-eye setting powder and concealing around the nose area.  The small brush set is really nice for blending out eye shadow and are sized really well for small contouring like around the nose area and for concealer. I really like the softness of all the brushes and the density of the larger set is what it should be.</li>
    <li> Two of my brushes came loose from the holder, and some bristles do fall out. But good for the price.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes in the mail and they are beyond amazing, so incredibly soft, high quality brushes! I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I know a good brush set when I see one and these brushes are definitely a sigma/mac style brushes! In love! :)</li>
    <li> i highly  recommend .. after countless searches to find the perfect thing to apply foundation i found it! after all the beauty blender hype i purchased one... problem is it was a pain to clean after every use even with the beuty blender soap..and it didnt give me the natural finish i want i purchased these and ahhh im in love. high quality and no shedding!</li>
    <li> Just got them &amp; they&#x27;re definitely reliable !</li>
    <li> This brush set is really soft and shipping was fast too. I love it.</li>
    <li> The perfect brushes for the perfect cheap price!</li>
    <li> Brushes look good and nice package. I think my daughter will love it!</li>
    <li> Definitely delightfully surprised at how nice these were. And so soft!</li>
    <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE THE BOMB.COM. I love them. They are ridiculously soft &amp; give full coverage without soaking up all your liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Only thing I have to say is these are a Must Have these brushes are soft the gold and black is nice I love them my new fav</li>
    <li> Must have item for the price. Upon opening the package it did have a weird smell like a synthetic smell of plastic but like &#x27;hello&#x27; it is synthetic. Lol the brushes are sooo soft and pretty dense base on the feel of it. But I haven&#x27;t tried it with my foundation yet. I&#x27;m  already confident that  it would be good by the feel of it. I will try it in a couple of days.  To give a follow  up.</li>
    <li> Really nice product! !!!</li>
    <li> Even i had read the reviews and all are positive, i was skeptical, but wow i loved it, they are so soft and they came really fast!!!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my teenage daughter.  She loves them!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing these brushes at first because of the price. These brushes work better than the high end brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I find myself reaching for these brushes everyday to apply my makeup. The only thing there&#x27;s a strong chemical smell when you first receive the brushes but once I washed them they went away. I would recommended these brushes to anyone that needs more brushes for their kit.</li>
    <li> Good quality, for a great price!</li>
    <li> I love love love the brushes and the hot pink bag they came in! I haven&#x27;t tried them yet as I&#x27;ve just gotten them but I&#x27;m sure theyre just as amazing as they look! :)</li>
    <li> Great brushes.  Nice and soft.  Wonderful value.</li>
    <li> I bought the same brushes from a different seller last time and I love it! Bought another set for my sister&#x27;s birthday.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you use 2-3 of these long term, it is worth the $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;They had a VERY strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts are too similar, not necessarily what I use&lt;br /&gt;No precision brushes for eye shadow.  There are several smaller brushes (see photos), but they&#x27;re all just odd, wider cuts that are at best like blending brushes, NOTHING for creases or even what I use for my lid.  The face bushes were okay, but 4 out of the 5 smaller brushes are basically useless.</li>
    <li> Best quality ! Worth every penny. Down side is that they definitely need a deep cleen/wash because you still can smell the factory.</li>
    <li> Love this brushes wish they were label though</li>
    <li> have you used sigma brushes? These are so similar i think they are from the same manufacturer. wash them before you use them &amp; enjoy this dope for sigma brushes! They may shed a little but i haven&#x27;t had that issue.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes for the price. I&#x27;ve paid this amount for 1 brush from MAC &amp; to be able to get more than 5 that do not shed &amp; are quality I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> Im in cosmetology school studying to be a makeup artist and I absolutely LOVE these brushes. I recently purchased them for my personal use after a classmate recommended them and I just ordered another set to use on my clients. They are so soft,blend easily, the bristles don&#x27;t shed, etc. I can&#x27;t say enough about them.</li>
    <li> These had such a strong smell and my brushes were hard.</li>
    <li> Love them, I don&#x27;t have any complaints. And they make my makeup look flawless when I&#x27;m completely finished!</li>
    <li> iMean come on people ! All these brushes for that little price .. At first iWas super skeptical but iSaid what the heck get them &amp; it was one of the best choices I&#x27;ve ever made ! All of them came in tip top shape !&amp; good packaging !! I&#x27;m serious !! if your into makeup like me.... GET EM&#x27; !</li>
    <li> Very great brushes for the price, was extremely surprised the picture is what I exactly recieved. The brushes are soft and blend very well, the eye brushes are a bit large for the eyes so I recommend using them as spot concealer face brushes</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Good assortment. Well made. Very soft, very sturdy. Nice quality. Highly recommend. I&#x27;ve even washed a few of them and they dry nicely and retain their shape and bristles.</li>
    <li> amazing brushes!! so soft and amazingly easy to use! they blend everything so smoothly &amp; thry are super soft! i am in love with my new brushes! i recommend you buying them &amp; especially for the price they are they are diffently worth buying &amp; having in your brush collection or even if your starting to explore in makeup i really do love them</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, easy to open packaging with plenty of protection around each individual brush head. Strong, unpleasant scent from brushes but easily fixable with a quick washing. So far, so good! Bristles are all intact, doesn&#x27;t seem to be shedding. Will update after more use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to using these brushes but I am loving them! I was skeptical at first because they were so reasonably priced but they are super soft, application is easy, and so far not fall out. I love the way my foundation looks flawless after each application. They&#x27;re very easy to clean which is always a plus. They distribute just enough product to your face and with these brushes the possibilities are endless, you can add more product for buildable coverage. I am very happy with my purchase so far!</li>
    <li> Really great deal. The brushes are firm and soft, and I haven&#x27;t had any stray hairs. This is a great deal &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Super good brushes and super soft.  Seem to be top quality.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes for the price, but they are not as firm as I was hoping for applying liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> The smell of the brushes are horrible I felt as if I had to call poison  control because I felt intoxicated and was ready to pass out but the brushes themselves are hit and misses but overall worth the price the smell if these brushes might make me return them.</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes however I only received 5 of the brushes. Extremely disappointed in that.. :( I got all the face brushes and the blending brush.</li>
    <li> The brushes are fine for the price, but the quality is not as great as some other cheap individual brushes sold on amazon. Also the smell of the chemicals when the brushes first arrived was HORRIFYING. I got dizzy and had to wash them 3 times before I could get them near my face.</li>
    <li> These brushes are surprisingly great quality. I love them and use them on a daily bases! My only thing though is that the ferrule does become a little loose after awhile, but not that big of a deal with superglue. The brissels are soft, but dense. Perfect cheap alternative to Sigma!</li>
    <li> Great and inexpensive!!!!</li>
    <li> I received my brushes about a week ago, and I love how quickly they came! I was slightly disappointed how they came packaged (each just wrapped in plastic) but for a dollar a brush I wasn&#x27;t expecting much presentation. THESE ARE THE SOFTEST MAKEUP BRUSHES OUT THERE FOR THIS PRICE. I have tried many high-end and drugstore makeup brushes and these by far are some of the best. The smell of them is really over powering when I first opened them, but from reading the other reviews I was expecting this and was prepared to wash them a few times before using. it smells like old acrylic paint (if that makes sense?)  After washing them twice the smell was 100% gone and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it since. While washing them, I was rough with them, just to show them whose boss, and I was surprised that there was no shedding what-so-ever. I have yet to try all of them out, but the flat top applies liquid foundation like a dream, and the bigger pointed one puts on bronzer amazingly. I do wish the individual brushes had names, or numbers, or something to distinguish them, but again, at $1 each, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. Overall this product is definitely worth the money; you&#x27;re getting a really high quality product for a drug store price and in the makeup world, that is always the best.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! extremely cheap! Perfect for foundation and eye make up!</li>
    <li> I Have always been very picky about my makeup brushes, but I gotta say these are great! They are dense and super soft! Although the blenders could be a little better I am truly satisfied.</li>
    <li> LOVE..... it takes some time to recieve them ... alil to long for my excitement !!! but THEY ARE SO WORTH IT! my concealer to eyeshadows and powder goes on so perfect i can never complain and i would for sure buy again... i have bought brushes before on amazon more expensive ones actually and they do not compare AT ALL!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I thought they were not going to be that good cause they are so cheap but I was wrong. They work great! I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes!  Some of the best.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these brushes and I will defiantly be repurchasing them. The set it an amazing price not only for the quantity but also the quality. I own many sephora, max, real techniques brushes. I am a makeup artist so I do use the brushes A lot! But I did purchase these for my own use. They are great with handling foundations and concealers. I did have a problem with one brush but this company took care of it right away. Do not&lt;br /&gt;Miss out on the brushes. They arrive in a cute bag and it&#x27;s like Christmas when they arrive.</li>
    <li> The brushes are so beautiful and soft. Really worth the price and could compare to high end products!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes so soft and blend very well.</li>
    <li> Really good brushes!! Applies makeup with ease!</li>
    <li> These are really amazing brushes! A must buy! The bristles are really soft, I love them! I received them faster than I thought. Eventhough there were reviews on this set regarding their condition, I have had no problem with them whatsoever. I have them a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;Best money I ever spent on brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> amazing quality brushes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in Loveeeee, these brushes are so soft and durable, Ive been using them for a few months now and they handle is a little wiggly, but other than that, it&#x27;s a great product for the price !</li>
    <li> its amaaaaazing .. i like it and the time of delivery perfect</li>
    <li> Just Amazing!! I find it better than real Techniques.</li>
    <li> great brushes, just need to be gorilla glued when they fall off.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever used! They&#x27;re soft, they make applying makeup so easy, and the price is amazing. They do shed a little, but for the price I can deal. I&#x27;ll never buy another brush set again.</li>
    <li> I received my order as expected - shipping was fast! I gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, but as soon as I do I will change my review, but I know i&#x27;m going to love them because the brushes feel very soft and they didn&#x27;t shed when I was playing with them.</li>
    <li> Great quality, supper affordable and fast shipping</li>
    <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these in May 2015 and it&#x27;s now September 2016. The handles DID come off of these brushes BUT I&#x27;ve had to throw away NEWER Sephora powder brushes and still haven&#x27;t had to throw these away. I wash them once a week or sooner depending on the week. I&#x27;m about to buy another set just to have a home and travel set. They really are great quality (besides the handles) but you can easily super glue them back together I just chose not to as they fit better in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;I GREAT steal on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGNAL POSTING:&lt;br /&gt;For the price I cannot be happier! They came in great condition. I wash my brushes after each use and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles shedding. These brushes allow me to have soft, blend able makeup! Such a great finish. The eyeshadow brushes are okay. They&#x27;re all a bit big, but I do use them and they work well. I&#x27;m glad I bought these</li>
    <li> Best brushes I have bought even over high end one&#x27;s! They haven&#x27;t shed at all over the last 6 months I have owned them! They do have a smell when you first open but if you wash them with soapy water it goes away and stays away, my sister in-law bought a set as well as loves them too! Amazing price for quality product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad quality, but not that great either. But with this kind of price, it&#x27;s really good!</li>
    <li> Great deal.  More than enough brushes.  Higher quality than i expected for the price.</li>
    <li> great brushes had no problem with them easy to work with but, most importantly it does not have loose hairs</li>
    <li> These are great brushes. I use them every day. The pointed brush is not my favorite though. It has weird plasticy feeling bristles</li>
    <li> Great brushes for an AMAZING price!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok. Too many are too similar. Need more variety. Don&#x27;t clean up very well either.</li>
    <li> as advertised, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Nice brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Soft and durable. Barely any hair falls out! Comparable to other high end kabuki style brushes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an amateur make-up person so take that into consideration with my review. I absolutely freaking love these make-up brushes. I was not trying to spend a bunch of money on brushes ao these brushes were a excellent alternative. They brushes are soft and awesome. This was a Bang For Your Buck winner!!! Get these...even if you don&#x27;t need them...cuz they&#x27;re jus that fabulous!</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, decent price.  I haven&#x27;t tried washing them yet, so I can&#x27;t say anything about how they hold up to cleaning.</li>
    <li> Cheap prices gets you cheap products.</li>
    <li> Ordered them yesterday around 4 n got them in today at 11! So pleased so soft apply fabulously recomend! Only down fall strong smell of paint but i can deal!!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes!!! Totally worth the money. They&#x27;re strong and nothing falls off when u run ur hands through them. Only concern is that the small brushes are a bit to big.</li>
    <li> These brushes are dense and look of great quality! I can tell I&#x27;m going to love them so much. Full sized and nearly packaged!</li>
    <li> These brushes are just as good as high end ones and they don&#x27;t shed after washing properly.</li>
    <li> Niece was overjoyed at receiving these for Christmas. I picked them up because they had much better reviews for durability than similar brush sets.</li>
    <li> Soft brushes! Love these</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to write one about this one because it&#x27;s an awesome deal if you know how to properly care for inexpensive makeup brushes.  I am somewhat of a beauty product aficionado and I have a lot of makeup brushes, both high end and inexpensive.  These are really great! They are dense and shaped really well.  I like the kabuki style brushes for foundation and cream products, which these are amazing for! The synthetic bristles make them very easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside with these brushes is that they aren&#x27;t super well put-together. That is easily fixable though. You just need a hot glue gun and a pen (or pen-like object). Here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash them thoroughly.  They do have that factory chemical smell that comes from all inexpensive brushes ordered from China. Let them dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Separate the handle from the brush head.  Yes, I separated the handle. These are not glued in well, so people who complain of the brushes breaking or the bristles coming out, this is why. Because there is not much glue holding them together, the handles will detach fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Put hot glue in the back side of the brush head.  BE CAREFUL, THE METAL PART WILL GET HOT (I ADVISE USING GLOVES FOR THIS PART).  Pour some hot glue in the back of the brush head and GENTLY pat it down with the pen.  This will help secure the bristles a little better.  Then put some hot glue around the rim of the brush head and quickly insert the handle.  This will help secure the handle on more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this with all of my brushes (and I have used this technique on other inexpensive brands as well) and it works well. Yes, it requires a little extra work to make these last long term, however for the price, I think it&#x27;s worth it.  The only other complaint I might have is that these soak up a lot moisture, so when you dry them after washing, try to dry them upside down.  Otherwise, a great buy!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and super soft. The prize is great too. I&#x27;m glad I looked at reviews before buying because I am very happy about this buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never wrote a review and I online shop A LOT. Can I just say these brushes are AMAZING. They came packaged just fine. They&#x27;re extremely soft and the flat top brush is my favorite to use for foundation. I do not have flawless skin but you would never be able to tell after I apply my makeup with these brushes.</li>
    <li> These a beautiful brushes ! They are very soft and very dense . I personally don&#x27;t have much use with the bigger foundation brushes because I have dry skin and the brushes pick up and make my dry skin noticeable . But I repurposed some of the big brushes for contouring and blush . Overall they are beautiful face and eyeshadow brushes !</li>
    <li> The brushes handles are made out of plastic and I thought it was going to be a wooden like handle but the brushes are soft just like the said it would and the shipping was pretty fast . I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it didn&#x27;t come with a brush guide and I just thought it was unprofessional!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in LOVE with these brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and easy to use on the face. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down on your hand when using it. You&#x27;ll be surprise that some brushes out there are a bit heavy hand to use. I would compare these to sigma or mac brushes with very little to no shredding of the bristles.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but smaller than they looked in picture</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal brush set for the price. I don&#x27;t have any super high end brushes to compare this to, but these are better quality than any I own, including an Everyday Minerals kabuki and a few random no brands that I think are animal hair. The bristles on these are nice and dense and the coverage is fantastic for both liquid or powder foundation. My only complaint with these is that the smaller &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; brushes are really too big for anything except blending. I would like to see three of these switched out for something more precise and controllable. Even then, five great quality face brushes for less than the price of one? What&#x27;s not to love? Oh, and fulfilled by Amazon means they got here super fast.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes with the Anastasia contour kit &amp; I&#x27;m blown away with how amazing these brushes are, they make your foundation look so much smoother. I&#x27;m obsessed. Thank you so much, shipping was on time and the packaging was beautiful;)</li>
    <li> These brushes are an amazing deal for the price. I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months and they&#x27;ve held up well through using and washing. The eye brushes are a little too big for precision shadow application but I&#x27;ve used them to blend and apply concealer and powder to the eye area. Even if you only use the face brushes, this set is well worth the price just for those.</li>
    <li> I bought these knowing they would be cheap, temporary brushes. I knew that the quality wouldn&#x27;t be very good and I was fine with this decision, however I was not prepared for the horrible, permanent, just spray painted smell that accompanied these. The smell is like the paint smell you would encounter in a car body/detail shop. Its very strong and Does NOT ever go away. I&#x27;ve had these brushes for months now, sitting open to air on a cabinet in my bathroom. I can still smell them when I walk by. Not even time can cure this odor.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a set of brushes like these for a while now and I was ecstatic when I discovered these! I have seen a similar, nearly identical set (the only difference is the brand name on the other) for nearly twice as much. They arrived quickly, each brush in its own plastic bag. As some have mentioned, there is a smell to them which can be solved by airing them outside for a couple of hours and washing them the way you would any other makeup brush. When the smell disappears, you will be left with these amazing brushes that are very sturdy and so incredibly soft. I&#x27;m so happy about this purchase and recommend them to anybody who doesn&#x27;t want to pay $40 for a single brush that gets the job as equally done by these!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical of these but something told me to try them and I am so glad I did. These are 100% synthetic and are very dense in texture. They are probably the softest brushes I own and I own brushes from Clinique, Real Techniques, Elf, you name it. They do have a strange smell when you first open them, but that is expected when they are synthetic. Just wash them before use (with an antibacterial soap and rinse well) and the smell is gone. You should always wash your brushes before use anyways so this did not bother  me. They blend out foundations and powders flawlessly. I use them for foundation, powder, contour, blush, eyeshadow and everything in between and I plan on buying more for myself and as gifts.</li>
    <li> these brushes are terrible.</li>
    <li> I bought these and they were great. I have been using elf brushes for years and was thinking about getting sigma brushes but these are JUST amazing.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice but all look basically the same</li>
    <li> Bought a set for me and my daughter and we Love!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes!!! They are cery soft and apply makeup very easily and evenly. The packaging does have a real bad smell but the brushed do not</li>
    <li> I honestly LOVE these brushes!!! They are soft and feels so much like the high end cosmetics brand. For the issue of the scent. It did have a strong scent but i was able to get the smell out. I used the brushes like normal and during the time i wash my brushes i used baby oil and then soap to get the makeup product off. Since then my brushes havent been smelling nothing but baby oil which i love. Hope that tip helps!!!</li>
    <li> Really impressed! I&#x27;m surprised at there quality for the price!! Definitely glad I purchased these. Nice full firm brushes! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Brushes are amazing very soft !</li>
    <li> I ordered this make up brush set on Friday and they arrived today. These brushes are exactly what I hoped them to be! Ultra soft bristles yet, strong, thick and full brush heads. The handles are also thick and easy to hold. High quality, professional make up brushes without the costly expense!!! I am sooooo happy with my purchase of these brushes because of the quality!  No shedding, strong, packed, thick brush heads, and ultra soft, smooth on the skin. There is a factory odor, but not a big deal, it will go away.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers have mentioned the smell of the brushes are pretty bad. Others have said that the tip of the brush falls off. These things are true but there are solutions. For the smell, just dust them a bit after unleashing them from the plastic and let them air out. For the runaway brush tip, super glue it or don&#x27;t bother with cheaper brushes. Aside from that, I really like how my foundation and concealer glide right on my face and make life that much easier. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of getting these sooner.</li>
    <li> These brushes are okay, this coming from a girl who is up SAST with make up brushes. They do the job. They do shed. They might be a good option to keep with you on the go however they are quite bulky. The smaller set of brushes are completely useless in my opinion the larger are pretty legit</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! The larger brushes are the ones I use the most and I love how they blend my makeup.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and at the same time a perfect stuff for great application! I can&#x27;t stand brushes that are so soft blending is impossible, these are the perfect kind of sturdy! I am sad I thought the smaller brushes were like eye brushes, and they can be, but they&#x27;re kind of big. However I bought these mainly for my face, and just two of the eye brushes and they work so well, being slightly larger is not really a big problem. These were a steal deal wise and I def would reorder them because of quality and price. They do smell out of the package, no worries, just wash them. These are fantastic and I am in love lol!</li>
    <li> These are really great brushes. They don&#x27;t shed and they are easy to clean. Love the price too!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Especially the flat round one, use it all the time to apply foundation. Use other brushes to blend contour powder. Love them so much and worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love how soft this set is and has almost every brush you need.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice quality.  It&#x27;s missing a eye brow comb brush combo.  That would have been nice.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes . Very good quality .  They did come with a strong plasticy chemicaly odor, but after washing them that disappeared.  One of the brushes did shed a tad bit , but again once I washed them that no longer happened. Each brush has its purpose and they apply makeup extremely smooth !</li>
    <li> First time purchasing a brush set. Went with this set because of the price. I would recommend these they are very soft on the face and don&#x27;t feel cheap. Only bad thing is that they dont all stay glued to the handle (nothing a little super glue cant help) and they do have a strong chemical smell which does eventually go away. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Some shedding but not much. Overall a really good set of brushes! Deff a syma dupe! The one that compares to the f80 is great for applying foundation flawlessly. SO HAPPY ABOIT MY PURCHASE</li>
    <li> I find these brushes yo be really soft. When I used them I notice they do not shed, which is great. I don&#x27;t have to worry about brush hairs all over my face and clothes.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for the price. Unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Its nice make up brush! The hair is not falling. Soft and love to use it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and very nice brushes</li>
    <li> After receiving these brushes in the mail, I immediately started using them. About a week into using them, I noticed the bristles were coming loose in the foundation rush. Ironically, it was right around the same time that the company did a follow up email with me to see how I liked their product. When I informed them that one of the brushes was having an issue, she immediately responded letting me know that they will be sending a replacement one immediately. Well, lo and behold, I got that brush in the mail a week or so later. I&#x27;ve had these now for about a month or so and no problems whatsoever. I&#x27;m thinking the brush with the bristles falling out must have been a fluke because they are all still in great condition and durable. Great customer service and amazing product!</li>
    <li> these brushes are nice and soft, my package came in a little early also. i got the gold ones and when i got it the gold was a little darker than in the picture so that was my only downfall. the brushes do smell like paint also but they have a paper inside explaining why and im sure it will go away after a couple uses. i posted these pics hust so you have an idea of what youre buying amd how youll recieve it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really used brushes before and don&#x27;t have anything to compare to, which is the only reason I don&#x27;t feel qualified to give five stars. I do love the brushes, though, and will absolutely order more.</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes !! I bought them about two months ago and they&#x27;re so soft, it&#x27;s really amazing for such a good price !</li>
    <li> i love these brushes although i have to say most of them where soft but i did find one or two to be a little rough in my opinion but it was worth my money for sure and came earlier then expected so im happy with this purchase !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about 2 weeks now, and I like them. There is little to no fallout, but there is bristles that are longer than others, so they end up sticking out. They do require me to use a little more product that I&#x27;m used to, but it isn&#x27;t a problem for me. The shipping took under a week, which I enjoyed. Overall, these brushes would be a 8/10 for me, personally. :)</li>
    <li> The brush head came broken. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes for an amazing price!</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with these brushes. You cant go wrong. They are super soft and dense. They are definatley Sigma&#x27;s dupes. Mine arrived sooner than stated and i actually recieved 2 eye makeup brushes additon to the 10. There was no smell to them and they work flawlessly and wonders on my skin. Its worth way more than $1 a brush. Buy it, you wont be disappointed. If you find any problem with your brushes customer service replaces them! 5 stars definatley!</li>
    <li> Are SUPER soft and that was just what I was looking for. The shapes are a little strange but overall pretty good.</li>
    <li> as someone who loves and uses makeup on a daily routine these brushes met my expectations other than the weird smell which I assume was from the synthetic hair used.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes they are very good quality. They do have a bad smell when you get them but after washing it totally goes away. They are very similar to sigma brushes. I looked up sigma brushed and labels these brushes as the sigma brushes would be. Since they are synthetic they don&#x27;t hold the makeup like other brushes do!. I would totally recomend these plus they are really affordable and great brushes!</li>
    <li> These are not very good.</li>
    <li> For the price of this product I was really surprised by the quality. The brushes are so soft and feel more expensive than they really are. The chemical smell you read about in other reviews is real but it didnt bother me because it goes away. I dont usually write reviews but i just want people to know that you dont need to spend a fortune for quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase after reading some of the reviews but I am happy to say that I purchased them anyway. The set is exactly as pictured and the feel of the brushes is great. They do have a strong odor when you first open them up but after a good wash they are perfect! You really cant beat it for the price. The brushes are soft to the touch but firm enough to pick up the colors. I am very happy with the purchase and I am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to all the negative reviews.</li>
    <li> Good brushes but the glue on it is not strong enough. The slick is just coming off.</li>
    <li> These are the softest makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever uses. Makeup goes on smoothly and evenly. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price! Work as good as sigma or other name brand brushes.</li>
    <li> These arent too bad at all. But I recommended spending the extra money to get good brushes. I bought sedona lace brushes after buying this, the difference in application is huge. if you like to blend, contour, etc, i recommend better brushes.</li>
    <li> Great deal for quality brushes</li>
    <li> I received the brushes very quickly and they were fantastic quality! I was a bit skeptical when I first purchased them, but I&#x27;m extremely satisfied that I did! Amazing brush quality for the price. I have washed the brushes multiple times and there has been no fallout as far as I am aware. The only negatives about this product is that the brush hairs are a bit sparse in the eye brushes and the brushes have a chemical smell upon receiving them, but once they are washed the smell is completely gone. They are extremely soft and complete their jobs very well!</li>
    <li> The brushes seemed to be good quality. They were very soft and definitely reasonably priced. My only problems was that for me, there wasn&#x27;t even range in the sizes. They are very close in size to each other. I was just looking for more of a variety. The company did a good job when I requested a return authorization, so I would say the company is good and if you don&#x27;t need a span of sizes in make-up brushes these should be good for you.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes for my wife on Christmas and guess what she didn&#x27;t believe the amazing quality with the softest bristles and the amount of brushes you get for this price. She was amazed at how amazing these brushes were for the price and super soft and don&#x27;t shed at all. You people shouldnt jude this product for its price or from where it comes, give it a try and trust me it wont disappoint you at all. So worth the money and also it came within 3 days, super fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> great set with great price.</li>
    <li> Very thick handles, but they are super soft!</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE! I never even used them because when they arrived they were in a plastic bag. It didn&#x27;t even have a discription of the brushes. Worst of all, they all smell like paint thinner! I am not using roses brushes in my face!</li>
    <li> Very very very baddddd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its broken very fast 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, one had a little hair fall out but it was okay it was like 2 hairs. They feel so smooth on the skin and I noticed a total difference from my other brushes. They came in on time and I was happy with them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good similar to the sigma brushes very soft!! :-) I love these will definitely be purchasing again</li>
    <li> These face brushes are not dense. They absorb liquid foundation quicker than you can get it onto your face. Better for blushes and bronzers, I guess. Won&#x27;t be reaching for these at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeshadow brushes hold onto product and don&#x27;t apply it to the eye. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes at an affordable price! So happy with my purchase! The brushes don&#x27;t shed and they pick up products well. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality of these brushes. Comparable to the high end brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brushes great price! They blend beautifully and are strong and no shedding so far. I washed them before using and they looked even better.</li>
    <li> They are what they seem to be good</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! I typically use the  IT cosmetic brushes but they can be a bit pricey. These work just as well and you get 8 brushes for less than the price of one IT brush. I heard these are dupes for sigma brushes though I myself have never tried a sigma brush. I will definitely continue purchasing these brushes!</li>
    <li> great brushes work well for me would buy again</li>
    <li> Brushes are fine, but the handles came off within a week! Just a little glue was holding then together.</li>
    <li> Great quality  really soft</li>
    <li> Well one of the brushes kept shedding the hair kept falling out witch I wish I could get a replacement on the brush .</li>
    <li> Great really smooth and make foundation look flawless</li>
    <li> Cheap product!! Would not buy again neither would I recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for price but easily breakable</li>
    <li> Great value! Love these</li>
    <li> They work very well, however, the metal part with the brush head isnt glued on very tightly.</li>
    <li> They all came in tact ready to use :)</li>
    <li> I use these to apply ink through stencils, play with acrylic paints, pouncing applications with stains, etc.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for the number of different types of brushes you get.  Never have seen hairs come out of them either.  I only use them for art projects.</li>
    <li> These are very nice brushes, especially for the price. The bristles are very soft but firm and work well for applying make-up... and there&#x27;s a huge selection... I only wish they had a couple smaller sizes, there&#x27;s no brush for detail work.</li>
    <li> Not quite as dense or firm as sigma&#x27;s sigmax kabukis, but work well. Some initial shedding. Great quality &amp; long handles. I washed twice before use to get rid of shedding &amp; chemical scent. Handles are long.</li>
    <li> It is not good quility.</li>
    <li> These are so soft and really great quality fir the price! Definitely recommending to my friends. This is a pretty complete set where I don&#x27;t need my older brushes any more.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Very Good seller</li>
    <li> They smelled like glue.  Two months later and they still stink.  I took the clear plastic covering off of them and two immediately separated from the handles.  The black part won&#x27;t stay on, so I have to hold the gold stub to use.  They are better off as a child&#x27;s play toy -- except for the chemical smell to them.  Highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> This set is awesome. Applies my foundation and makeup well</li>
    <li> Nice set of brushes for a good price.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they work just the same as any other name brand brushes....I totally recommend these brushes on anyone</li>
    <li> Very soft and give a nice blended finish! Not very happy with the eye shadow brushes, they don&#x27;t seem to pick up much shadow on them. Other than that worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Quality is the same as MAC or sigma. Definitely a great buy. Will repurchase when these get old.</li>
    <li> happy with my brushes</li>
    <li> Beautiful Brushes a lot like the bh cosmetics ones! I wish it had some of the thin brushes though!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes the only thing is that they stink when you first get them so make sure you wash them &amp; thank god they didn&#x27;t shed when I washed them or used them so that&#x27;s great. 💞</li>
    <li> They are ok for starters</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes. Easy  to use. And I&#x27;ve been able to apply make up flawlessly. I would recommend them to anybody that wants nice makeup brushes but doesn&#x27;t want to spend much.  The handles BOLD AND THICK and a hard like plastic, very sturdy. Happy with them! **The only thing is that they are all very FULL and similar size LARGE (angled brushes are not that angled).</li>
    <li> The brush heads are nice and firm, they give a beautiful finish. Soft and full bristles.</li>
    <li> The chemical smell is horrible. Smells like paint. Is it the glue? Idk but I washed the brushes in baby shampoo, baking soda, and warm water and it got rid of most of the smell. It&#x27;s still there....a bit faint and I think as I clean them it will go away. The brushes don&#x27;t shed a whole lot. Not yet for me and I don&#x27;t know if it will. But I hope they wont because other than the chemical smell I do really like these and they are very soft.</li>
    <li> Great brushes!  Very soft on the face.</li>
    <li> These brushes look and feel great! I&#x27;m so glad I ignored the 1 star reviews about the brushes smelling too much like chemicals. One brush wash and it was gone. So excited to use these.</li>
    <li> This will be my first review on a product. I don&#x27;t like writing reviews but I just had to review this product. These brushes are awesome. The package arrived on time also, brushes are very very very soft and it works perfectly. And yes I agree with all reviewers that compared these brushes to the high end ones. For what I paid for them, I was amazed by what I got. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These brushes were really awesome and changed my makeup application greatly.  I am really happy with how the brushes are working out.  They smelt a little weird, but after cleaning them it wasn&#x27;t a really big deal.  They are also extremely soft and pretty large brushes which was a plus.  Each brush is really good to have in your makeup kit, so I think it was a great purchase. The variety of brushes you get gives you a lot of different options for application also.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love these brushes!!!! No shedding easy to clean and great quality... I&#x27;m a make up artist so I use them several times a day... Trust me these brushes are a steal...</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSHES! Was skeptical because of the prices but previous comments encouraged me to purchase and I am sooo happy! 5 Stars for these brushes and the service. Received then in less than a week. Don&#x27;t have to spend my money on crazy expensive brushes because these do a fantastic job!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes on Tuesday and received them the following Thursday, which is a huge plus because I hate waiting. The brushes are made well, they are extremely soft and they are a wonderful price! This is a must have for anyone on a budget but doesn&#x27;t want to sacrifice quality.</li>
    <li> I have yet to use them and am considering returning them as the dyed acrylic smell is beyond overwhelming. I&#x27;m afraid to use them fearing it with irritate my skin due to the intense dye they used on these brushes. I laid them out for a week I&#x27;m the sun thinking the smell would be less intense but no decrease in odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with these, great brushes for a great price!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for their price</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I am not an expert with makeup but these brushes are wonderful!</li>
    <li> The kabuki bushes are the best like the best ever!! So soft going across your face. If you don&#x27;t have you have to get.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone could give this less than 5 stars for the price. They will be perfect for my start at contouring my face.</li>
    <li> These brushes were actually really good. I live in LA these came frm Vegas the next day. Good price. The eyeshadow ones are blah not too much to brag about. But the large face brushes I loveee!!!!</li>
    <li> Liked these enough that I bought 2 sets. Mainly all of the smaller brushes are different and I wanted two that were the same for eye shadow. I am sorry that one of the larger ones is not bigger for dusting on finishing power. I use these for blush and highlighter and it almost looks airbrushed on.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this 5 stars if the variety was more in line with how I use my brushes. I will say there is a store that I frequent that has brushes like these for $15 to $35 EACH.</li>
    <li> SUPER SOFT!!! love them! extremely good for the cheep price!</li>
    <li> Awesome, very soft, great coverage. Just saw the same brushes on another website for $35</li>
    <li> I got them on time but they are just okay not my favorite also sometimes hair fall while putting the makeup.</li>
    <li> I use all the small brushes for crease work or blending. The large flat top brush I use for foundation, literally my favorite foundation brush! The large pointed brush I use for highlighter... Idk it just works.. The flat angled brush I use for cream blush, the rounded angled brush I use for contour and the other two I use for any face blending necessities.</li>
    <li> Great quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> Amazing I got mine today only a 3 day wait I love them</li>
    <li> Great for powders, not so great for liquids. Good brushes overall.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet but so far I love them! They seem nice sense; enough to use a liquid foundation. The eye shadow brushes are a little long and less dense than the face ones. They are super soft though. There also is a strong smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as some people said. The package came in no time and they are so worth the price! My mom is going to buy some now(:</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM THATS ALL!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are great, used them this morning and my makeup is flawless. The only problem I have is one of my handles fell out the first time I picked it up, poor glueing. I would of also liked a chart saying what brush is for what task. I know the diffrent uses but for people that aren&#x27;t used to using them, a guide would be great. They are very soft and hold the makeup well, not sure how long they&#x27;ll last but so far I love them and it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
    <li> Brushes started to break from handle after a a few months but got use for the price</li>
    <li> A lot of bang for your buck! Great product</li>
    <li> I have tried many brushes from Amazon, so far, these are my favorite. they don&#x27;t lose any hair from them, like some brushes do. they&#x27;re thick and have all the good sizes for every area of the face. the only problem is that there are a few that break, where the gold metal part and the brush will become detached from the black wood handle. however, that can be fixed with a little hot glue. definitely worth the purchase for the price. they&#x27;re overall good brushes as long as you don&#x27;t mind having to fix a few with hot glue.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. Really impressed.</li>
    <li> when i opened the packaging, i was thrilled to see how soft and expensive they looked.I ordered these with a makeup pallette and ended up trying really vibrant colors with these...so, i gave them a wash. They&#x27;re still soft but the thinner ones lost their shape.Also , while i was using the contouring brush , i had about 20 bristles on ny cheek, which was weird!</li>
    <li> Some shedding, good quality otherwise</li>
    <li> For the price, I got brushes that do the job</li>
    <li> The brushes smell like the fumes that come out of my garage when my father works on his car and the tops broke off right away. I don&#x27;t want to be putting anything near my face that smells like car exhaust.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> (Rob&#x27;s girlfriend here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how awesome these brushes are for the price. Very good quality brush heads. The metal part that fastens the brush head to the cheap plastic handle is crap, but I wasn&#x27;t bothered by it.</li>
    <li> Really amazing like I&#x27;m IN LOVE😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️</li>
    <li> So far so good! Very soft, great quality. Did not expect such nice brushes for so cheap.</li>
    <li> A soft but sturdy brush.  Great set</li>
    <li> I love these brushes and their quality</li>
    <li> Looks great, i love the set, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are AMAZING brushes for the price, Great quality! The smell goes away after you use them a couple times, but other than that I totally reccomend these, great quality! Really soft and the foundation brush is good for blending.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because of the price and the size of the brushes. It was fast delivery and when I opened them I absolutely loved the way the brushes feel. I tried them out on my make up and they blended very well. It&#x27;s my everyday brushes to use when I put on my makeup. I highly recommend this product. In fact j am going to get a few more sets for my friends and another for myself.</li>
    <li> the brushes are kind of short and not much difference between them</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing.  I use to apply my eyeshadow primer also to apply my foundations and powders.  Good quality brush well packaged...  I Love them</li>
    <li> The best brushes for the money. They do snell like chemicals when you first get them, so let them air out a bit. But over-all great quality, soft, silky, cleans well.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much of these brushes but I love them. Not as dense as other brands on the market but definitely worth trying. Thinking about ordering another set in a different color. They do have a strong paint scent when you open the package at first but after they are out for a while and you wash them the smell is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was extremely fast.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!! Had to wrestle them out of my daughter&#x27;s grasp</li>
    <li> Bought for my 21 yr old sister whose a make-up fanatic and she absolutely loved this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers have mentioned, these brushes arrived with a STRONG chemical smell. The first thing I did was wash them in a mild baby shampoo (like I do for my other makeup brushes) and let them air dry overnight. A few of the them shed while I was washing them, but not a lot. The next day I noticed that the chemical smell was still there, but only on the brush handles, not the bristles themselves. I think it may be the kind of paint they used on the handles. The brushes are good quality, as they are soft yet dense. If you can get past the lingering smell, I think they&#x27;re worth the $12.</li>
    <li> When these brushes came it had a smell like paint I was so sad at first but then after I left it out side for a few moths yes a few moths because I was thinking that I was going to throw them away but then I notice no more smell!! yeah I&#x27;m so glad they look great!! can&#x27;t wait to try to use them!!</li>
    <li> Very structured expensive-looking brushes and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> These brushes were amazing, could he compared to professional brushes. They did have a funny smell upon opening, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. But overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Seriously? These brushes came apart the second day of using them. Idk how it got so many reviews but mine fell apart</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price. They look nice and they are really soft. Definitely recommend to those who are don&#x27;t really care for brand name brushes but still want quality brushes for a good price. They look just like the picture and they were delivered very fast.</li>
    <li> There is some shedding but not much. Great quality for being so cheap</li>
    <li> These brushes are a lot bigger then I expected. The eye shadow brushes are good for blending, but that&#x27;s it. I really like blush and foundation brush. One of my brushes already broke off though. I&#x27;ve had it only for a few weeks. This is an okay set, but wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Brush are super soft and it works great. The shipping was fast and I love it.</li>
    <li> First of i want to start of by saying i am a professional makeup artist for Christian Dior. Ive used some of the most expensive brushes and i have to say these are amazing! They leave my makeup looking flawless. Brushes are very important to achieve good makeup, these were great! The only con was the chemical smell.</li>
    <li> Ok but there weren&#x27;t a great deal of variation</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They are so soft and apply my make-up smooth and awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Brushes are very high quality for the price. I bought brushes from Sephoras ($80) and I can honestly say these might be better high quality</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, great quality!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter who&#x27;s on her way to becoming a cosmetologist.  She loves them!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes for the price!! Love em!!</li>
    <li> Great quality and variety for the price. They are soft and work great!</li>
    <li> This product is great the brushes are soft enough for the price you pay also good quality. haven&#x27;t used them yet but I pulled the brushes to make sure they didn&#x27;t shed and they didn&#x27;t. Definitely would recommend to buy these, especially for beginners like myself.</li>
    <li> Brushes are starting to fall apart a little</li>
    <li> So far, so good...I received my brushes today and I must say I&#x27;m happy.  Some  (most) of the reviews talked about the smell, I was a little afraid to purchase, well, there is a slight, very slight odor but not bad at all... OVER EXAGGERATED...also because of the reviews, I have a hot glue gun on standby...I had planned to deliberately separate the brushes from the handles and reglue them...I can&#x27;t get them a lose...more exaggeration...I will do more updates as time passes...hope this helps...I&#x27;d recommend these brushes at this moment and time to anyone  period &amp;amp; no one has given me nor offered me anything for this review...a great gift to me from my niece...Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BACK 6/27/2016&lt;br /&gt;I still find the brushes to be a great buy, SOME of the handles did come loose  (mainly on the larger brushes) hot glue gun fixed them right up. I still recommend these brushes to anyone</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with these brushes! They work so well, just like professional brushes. You are saving so much money!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I bought these brushes! I saw mixed reviews so I was a little nervous about buying them, but for the price I was willing to try them. I wear them every day. I don&#x27;t use my beauty blender because I use the flat top brush for my foundation :) I just wish there was more brushes for eyeshadows. Other than that, they are my go to everyday!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great.  They are really dense, and hold powdered &amp; liquid (even though I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re meant to be used for that!) really well, and apply your makeup very evenly.  I wish that they had a couple of additional sized brushes, and I&#x27;m embarrassed to say...I kind of wish they said on the handles what they&#x27;re supposed to be used for, but they&#x27;re by far the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased better quality brushes at costco</li>
    <li> Love them. Really nice for the price.</li>
    <li> Love love love thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and one of the handles broke off like the first week I used it. AND 2 of mine are shedding like crazy. I keep finding pieces of it all over my fave when I use it! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> 6/10 are soooo hard and stiff. I&#x27;m not sure if glue leaked on it, if they are purposely made like that or if I need to wash them first but they have no give AT ALL. I&#x27;m very disappointed after all the good reviews it got. There is no way that the &amp;#34;eyeshadow&amp;#34; brushes can be that hard, it would rub your eyelid raw in 2 strokes. The 4 brushes were great though and they do look nice! Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> i really love these makeup brushes they are so soft :)</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes, but the bases do fall off unless you hot glue them!</li>
    <li> so thankful for the reviews on these brushes, I was still on the fence but after reading the review from the lady who told you how to make these brushes last longer with a hot glue gun, I figured for 7.20$ I had to try it. They&#x27;re so soft but still hold product well. They Clean easy and have not shed at all yet, I think I have had them over a month now. I did use once or twice and they were coming unglued from their handles. So I did what the previous reviewer did and fired up the hot glue gun as instructed and now they are better than ever!! Thanks so much!! Great brushes with a little extra glue, I cant beat that. It only took 1 mini glue stick to reinforce them all.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so great. The bristles are soft and feathery and light. I love how soft it feels on my skin. They blend foundation like a dream and concealer also. Ive had them for a good time and Ibarely notice any shedding at all. The eyeshadow brushes blend colors so good. I haven&#x27;t used any other brushes except for my eco tools eyeliner brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I used dish soap and coconut oil to wash these brushes and the bristles started coming out of them the next day. I&#x27;m guessing the coconut oil dissolved the glue holding the bristles. My other brushes didn&#x27;t falter. For the price, these aren&#x27;t bad but you might not want to use any oil to clean them .</li>
    <li> Not what i expected, a lot smaller. But they are good quality and came very quickly so service was exceptional.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.  Item work great! Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> All I have to say is they didnt disappoint... I love them!! So far so good ... there super soft n pretty ..easy to clean n maintain ... I hope I can find bigger powder brushes like these ...</li>
    <li> Great price for these brushes. I got a silver set for my Daughter &amp; a gold set for myself. We did have some handles come loose &amp; fall off of 3 on one set &amp; 4 on the other. There&#x27;s a great review on top of here that will explain how you can easily fix this issue! A hot glue gun, &amp; a bit inside and the handle will be tight on them forever! I knew this when I purchased them, so it wasn&#x27;t a problem . For the price of these, the quality is great and you get a lot of  different sizes, shapes. It&#x27;s well worth it. But don&#x27;t expect to pay $10-$12 for a bunch of decent quality brushes &amp; get upset that the handles come loose. It&#x27;s an easy cheap fix &amp; you&#x27;ll have great brushes for a few dollars!&lt;br /&gt; Like she said, when you get them, wiggle the handles until they come off &amp; fix it permanently with the hot glue gun. That way your not in the middle of getting ready to go out, putting on your foundation, concealer and it comes off and your pissed! Lol -&lt;br /&gt; They are really soft, I&#x27;ve had NO shedding with either set. Or so minimal that I didn&#x27;t take notice. They wash well, and dry nice and soft. Any loose hairs should come out when you wash them which should be done as soon as you get them &amp; before you use them. I will be buying more sets to have, &amp; in case the price goes up or they aren&#x27;t around after. They are really great brushes and you can&#x27;t , can&#x27;t beat the price! I&#x27;ve bought expensive brushes where 1 eye brush was about $40, and I will never spend that money on brushes again! These are just as good ( after you fix the handles) and SO much cheaper! I will put my money towards great makeup that I use to spend stupidly on a few brushes because they say * MAC or * Sigma on them. Your  paying them for the name &amp; for the company to promote their products. These are Good, quality brushes where it really matters- the hairs that touch your face &amp; put your makeup on. They don&#x27;t soak up the foundation, it applies it to your skin &amp; doesn&#x27;t streak or micro exfoliate your skin as your rubbing and make it flake so your makeup isn&#x27;t smooth. These are soft, but will stand up to any technique of applying foundation, powders, concealer, shadows etc.&lt;br /&gt; Spend your money on great makeup and save a lot on these gems.&lt;br /&gt; Love these. I&#x27;ve used liquid, all sorts of powders ( Ben nye loose, bare minerals, benefit) , pro cream foundation and concealer a ( Kett, Graftobian, Mehron)  , also cream, powder blushes &amp; highlighters and these brushes performed great with ALL of them.&lt;br /&gt; I recommend these highly, even with the small easy fix issue with the handles!&lt;br /&gt; Love and buying more sets...&lt;br /&gt; ( silver ones look just like my expensive brushes . I have to look for the name to tell. The gold is a bit cheaper looking, just the tone to me seams cheap looking. But they all perform the same , but I will be getting a few more sets and all in the silver. ) just in case anyone was choosing between colors- I&#x27;d stick with the silver.

    <li> One of the best makeup brushes. It is very soft and long lasting!</li>
    <li> These brushes are Devine! So soft and fluffy and easy to clean.  Foundation goes on smooth!</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with my new brushes they feel amazing recommend hot gluing the handle if and when it comes off!</li>
    <li> Great brushes works well, the smell was strong but it wasn&#x27;t stinky but just a new package smell. Thankyou</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with makeup brushes!!! Some of the hairs fall off it only happened once. But it wasn&#x27;t a lot so I gave it 5 stars. Never happened again so I love these brushes!!!! I use them on a daily basis!!!!!</li>
    <li> not bad for synthetic brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived earlier than thought! And the flat top kabuki just blends foundation beautifully! I love these!</li>
    <li> They are ok. not the best brushes but for the price they do the job</li>
    <li> I love them great for a beginner</li>
    <li> My wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just crazy good for the price.  I&#x27;ve got awkward skin which sometimes doesn&#x27;t behave when I&#x27;m applying makeup.  I do have a really good set of brushes already,  but these have quite honestly run circles around the others.  FINALLY my foundation looks natural.  I can&#x27;t find any fault,  but if there is I can take the super helpful trick another buyer posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love LOVE these and will recommend over and over.</li>
    <li> I AM IN LOVE! These brushes are like high end brushes but for cheap prices!! They are so soft on your skin and apply make beautifully! I am so happy with my purchase. I would recommend these to anybody. Just be sure to wash them thoroughly before using. :)</li>
    <li> Was hesitant to buy these brushes but I actually love em. I&#x27;ll be buying another set of two to gift to my friends.</li>
    <li> These brushes are better than the ones I have from Sephora. There is a brush perfect size for every aspect of putting on make up</li>
    <li> I got my brushes today and they r great. Yes the smell is there but do yourself a favor and buy some Johnson &amp; Johnson baby shampoo (the gold one) and wash your brushes as soon as you get them. In your palm swish the brush around run them under warm water and wash the handle Til suds appear. Then rinse n gently squeeze them out in a towel. And stand up with the handle side up to dry. As for falling apart from the handle I Dnt know that yet BUT I am going to get some pretty duct tape and tape my brushes because that gold is ugly haha. Any who they&#x27;re soft and beautiful and they aren&#x27;t really big. And if you know what to do with what brush it shouldn&#x27;t be confusing but someone on here help with that of you don&#x27;t know and you are just startin with makeup! Overall great brushes but make sure u wash them. Airing them out will do nothing.</li>
    <li> Loved these. They work great especially for 12$ you can&#x27;t beat it! It did have a chemical smell from the packing, I have several brushes so I let them air out 4 days and the smell was gone. Packaged and sent very well. I liked it so much I ordered 3 more sets for my mother and aunts.</li>
    <li> These are okay but I don&#x27;t feel the quality is what was described</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price especially for foundation, blush, bronzer and concealer.  Bristles too flimsy for prescision eyeshadow application in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Overall very good quality for the price. People always asking how my foundation looks airbrushed. Only thing was the strong smell they do have so I suggest washing them before use. The smell won&#x27;t compelty go away after wash but with time eventually it will. Also out of the 10 brushes only one of them came messed up the top part was coming out and you could have seen the glue on the bristles. But you do get what you paid for so I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and I Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re great brushes for foundation and concealer usage but i wouldnt recommend using the smaller brushes for eyeshadows. I&#x27;ve noticed when i use them for eyeshadows, my makeup look muddy(too blended?). Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they apply foundation and concealer immaculately but not suitable for anything other than face makeup really. Sorry ladies and gentleman.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m AMAZED at the quality of these brushes. I have a $200 kit from Sephora and I still prefer these.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really good. They have a weird smell at first, but once you take them out of the box and air out they&#x27;re fine. They work good and are really inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Super soft</li>
    <li> amazing!!! Like a cheap version of MAC brushes!</li>
    <li> very soft, great variety</li>
    <li> Great products for the price.</li>
    <li> good bristles on the brushes but poorly manufactured. bottom of brush came apart after a few uses....</li>
    <li> Very good brushes, very soft. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Bang for your buck! Good quality and variety.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay. A couple of my brushes have already fallen off without me even using them yet.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Extremely surprised with the quality!!!!</li>
    <li> Great variety of different size brushes</li>
    <li> Love them my makeup looks flawless! with them. Very minimal shedding but the handles have to be glued back on with my handy glue gun</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price! From what I&#x27;ve tried, these seem to match the quality of brushes you could purchase at a drug store or big box store at a better price. I simply ADORE the contour brush - the brush feels like mink! I&#x27;m addicted to that one brush, which makes it worth the price!</li>
    <li> Omg buy buy buy buy buy  the best brushes in the world Omg buy</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes, great quality</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing, good value and quality</li>
    <li> I am super happy with these brushes they are great!</li>
    <li> I received my brushes :) I have not used them yet but I will - they feel soft</li>
    <li> Brushes are nice and work well with all my cosmetics</li>
    <li> Great service, fast shipping. The bag the brushes came in was a nice touch to the product. Brushes are amazingly soft. I love them.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes shipping was great and fast they feel wonderful only problem one broke already will buy again tho...</li>
    <li> i absolutely love these brushes, after i ordered them i read some reviews and some people has negative comments about the brushes shedding, i was afraid i was going to get horrible and cheap brushes but i was wrong, they arrived on time and they were new and they were in good shape, i tested the brushes and the after look looked flawless. The brushes did a perfect job blending in the foundation and contouring. I totally reccomend this!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes! It says you get 10 brushes for 10 dollars, we&#x27;ll I got 12 brushes for 10 bucks. They were shipped perfectly and got them really fast!!</li>
    <li> Wooden handle breaks easily</li>
    <li> So theses brushes are great...my only issue is that they do have a strong chemical smell to them..other than that they are strong and sturdy for your makeup routine...must buy.</li>
    <li> I love them! Great deal on some nice brushes!</li>
    <li> I absolute love these brushes they came in the next day, they are soft and amazing.</li>
    <li> Received these brushes very shortly after ordering and I love them! Very soft and they don&#x27;t leave little hairs as you use them. Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> These are actually good quality brushes for the price!!! I love all the brushes in the set. They are all Kabuki style which is exactly what I need. They all contribute to making my face look like a dream every single day! They are very soft and easy to wash too! Buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it! I swear.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for low price, I was surprised how soft they are. Recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I think these brushes are AMAZING for their price. There were some long hairs that needed to be trimmed but other then that they do the job so well and are incredibly soft! I am very happy with purchasing these brushes!</li>
    <li> Brushes were delivered promptly and the quality is great!</li>
    <li> Upon opening the package I noticed a strong plastic smell. This dissipated after a few days. The brushes are incredibly soft and feel very natural. After a few months of use the binding for the plastic stem has started to come loose. They are still functional but just annoyingly wobbly. I also find them incredibly hard to clean. The product soaks up foundation to the bottom of the brush even if you wash after every single use. I wanted to really fall in love, especially after all the rave reviews but this was a miss for me.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing I love them! They do not suck up all the product. However when washing the brushes, be careful to wet the handle because they detach easily. I had to glue mine back together.</li>
    <li> At first i thought they were great brushes. The first time i used it i got itchy all over my face abd upper body. So i washed t hem and try again. Um itchy all over again.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for awhile now, and I just have to say that they are the absolute best! Not because of the price, but because of the quality. They are so incredibly soft and deliver a flawless look. I have used many Mally Beauty brushes and these are SO much better. I love everything about them. They didnt have a strong smell at all upon arrival and after washing them literally all the time, no fallout with the hairs. I will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> I really did love this so much but they smell weird. They do not cause any irritation or anything like that, it&#x27;s just the smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered 4 sets of these for myself and as gifts for family members.  These are absolutely amazing!  They are extremely cheap (in price) but not quality.  I marvel at the fact that the bristles are so soft and yet are synthetic; most synthetic bristles hurt the face, but these ones don&#x27;t!  They are exactly as the picture shows them, so they look very classy.  Fallout occurs with all brushes, expensive or inexpensive, so it is not a big issue here if you take really good care of them and keep them clean!  Overall very satisfied with this product, would recommend and will buy again!</li>
    <li> They are nice the first couple of days but they she&#x27;d to much in all honesty they do</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes.  Yes, there is a strong chemical odor at first, but I simply washed in gently soap, let air dry and within days, it was gone.  These are VERY soft and work well.  The eye brushes are a tad large for me ( I Prefer a pencil brush for the crease and a small smudge brush for blending ) BUT they are still a great value and I would re-purchase.  No shedding or stiffness.  Nice product!  :)</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, for a good price.</li>
    <li> The brushes don&#x27;t really shed and they are soft. Definitely a good deal for 10 dollars</li>
    <li> They are sooooo good ! Very soft and useful ! Im totally in love with them. Im so glad i bought them</li>
    <li> very good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> They smell horrible...</li>
    <li> Brushes were soooo soft!! Great product so far.</li>
    <li> My brushes just came in today and so far they&#x27;re great. All the brushes are soft and they apply my foundation and eyeshadow perfectly! + Brushes are sleek&lt;br /&gt;+ great price</li>
    <li> Awesome Brushes!! Very cheap price!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very nice for the price, I would purchase them again....</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and sturdy they work amazingly and would recommend these brushes to anyone</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. My make up goes on like a professional. I would recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> Best thing I ever did was ordering these! So soft &amp; the coverage is amazing. Shipped very fast! Definitely worth the money! :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are fabulous for the price. They are extremely soft, and there are several different kinds both for face and for eyes. I really like how they evenly apply my foundation. I&#x27;m so used to just using sponges because of the flawless coverage but the foundation brush does the same job if not better. The eye blending brushes work great, and one I even use to blend my under-eye concealer. Overall I&#x27;m extremely impressed. No shedding, no bad smell, very happy! Even came packaged nicely &amp; delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> Starting to fall apart</li>
    <li> Really good brushes.  No problems with separation or shedding.</li>
    <li> Love them!! The price and quality are great!! However, the face brushes are a little bit smaller than the standard face brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes arrived sooner than expected. Packaging wasn&#x27;t the best but you have to keep the price in mind. Quality is great for the price! Would&#x27;ve rated higher but I did receive a broken brush...nothing that a little super glue couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent and it&#x27;s hard to find well made brushes like these so cheap! I have not had any issues with bristles falling out. The brushes come in a zip bag which was nice, they also have plastic sheathes to protect them in the long run. would recommend if you need a good cheap set.</li>
    <li> Great quality not cheaply made!! Fast shipping as well. Im a professional MUA and I use these in my kit.</li>
    <li> Over all these are good brushes. I gave them 3 stars because one of mines broke right out of the package and I had to glue it back. : ( I did not like that the brushes do not have what each one should be used for written on them. For the price I guess I got what I paid for. Over all they are not bad.</li>
    <li> After one use: One brush shed a little. They also smelled a bit but after washing they are ok. They are also very soft and good enough variety of brushes. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was undecided whether to buy these brushes or invest the money you would spend on others like mac or sSigma, because I wanted something that worked. Take the decision to buy and really loved !!! You get a incredible termination, apply the liquid and pasty bases spectacular  as well the blush and powder makeup. Do not hesitate to buy is an excellent investment, apart from the flat brushes are used to apply shadow, especially the brush used to blending, which has been an incredible tool to achieve a professional finish. As for the smell mentioned is real, but wash with facial cleanser and the smell left.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, no shedding and look exactly like the pictures. Smell a little funny but over all work great. Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> So I bought this brushes and was surprised at how quickly they arrived. At first I thought this was a 4 star product but after washing them that changed. First of all they are very very soft that I give them. They&#x27;re not as dense as I thought but still a good size. The smell is pretty strong and I thought that it would go away after washing them. I WAS WRONG.  I&#x27;ve washed them twice and it&#x27;s still there. They didn&#x27;t shed except one and ALOT! A piece of it came off the flat angled brush. :(  They are under $11 so I guess you get what you paid for them.</li>
    <li> My daugther is very happy. The package arrived on time and the quality is really very good. Thanks, it&#x27;s absolutely recommended.</li>
    <li> They smell HORRIBLE when you take them out of the package.</li>
    <li> Eyeshadow brushes started to fall apart after I washed my brushes. Face brushes were more durable but I&#x27;m sad I have to replace all my eyeshadow brushes now.</li>
    <li> You get more than what you paid for. I love these brushes. They&#x27;re very thick so it makes application flawless and the fibers are so incredibly soft. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste hundreds of dollars on brand name brushes</li>
    <li> These are really good quality for the price. I wanted to replace my Sonia Kashuk foundation brush because the hairs kept falling off after using it for a few months. These are half the price and work really well!</li>
    <li> They have a strong alcohol type smell, but they are amazing, going to wash the tonight, hopefully will get the smell out, and they came with a round foundation sponge, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Cannot beat the quality of these for this price!</li>
    <li> I will start by saying I did have high expectations after reading the reviews. I am by no means a beauty guru and barely have any idea as to what brush does what, but these brushes are amazingly soft and seem so far to be superb quality. Excellent price for the quality, I would definitely recommend this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the product comes in a clear plastic bag and the smell isn&#x27;t great at first, but it goes away after opening them and there is nothing to worry about!</li>
    <li> Great value. I returned a high end brushes.  I loves these, are soft. Makeup looks good.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> As soon as I got them, I noticed they were shedding a bit, but not too much. And you can tell they just came from a factory, all the brushes smell like glue. But, as for how they apply, they are most definitely the best of the best! I&#x27;m very satisfied with these brushes :)</li>
    <li> The wife likes them. Just wishes there were a few smaller brushes.</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes was great but the flat top kabuki was defective. Most of the hairs came out when I opened the pack and I had to throw it away. The rest are great</li>
    <li> So soft! Great quality</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, flimsy construction.  Yes they are soft and quite frankly there is a lot of redundancy in the amount of brushes and what to use them for.  My biggest issue and clearly many others here on amazon, the brush head with metal clamp fell of many of the brushes the first time I used them.  Now I happen to be handy and plan to add some adhesive to each clamp and reset each of the handles.  The price is cheap, the brushes are soft. Sure I can fix this, but would prefer that I did have to do that.  Rather I would have been much happier with FEWER brushes that were constructed well.</li>
    <li> These brushes took about 3 weeks to come in and I&#x27;m not impressed. They are extremely thin and cut weird and are incredibly difficult to work with. I think I expected to much off of the picture. The price should have warned me. If you are a beginner with makeup or just do makeup for fun I guess they would be ok but for a professional they basically are useless. Sigma brushes are a million times better. If your looking for Quality these aren&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I like them a lot. They are soft but stiff enough to use and pick up makeup well. The only downside I have is the smell of the brushes when they arrived. It&#x27;s nothing gross but more of like a plastic scent. I ignored it to be honest because I was too excited to use them. They are my daily go to brushes. The smell goes away and I&#x27;m sure you could wash it off.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive brushes. Larger brushers are great for liquid foundation. The smaller brushes are good for eye shadow but they are a tad bit larger than I expected but they do work well. Very soft bristles and large handle makes for a comfortable hold. They do have a slight smell but that goes away after a good washing. I would totally get these as a gift.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about ordering makeup brushes online, but I read all the reviews on this set and they are everything they said they are.. These brushes are soft and smooth.. I lOVE this set.. I wish they made other brush sizes as well so I could buy them too..&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny BUY them You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised with the quick shipping, great size, and perfect quality! I can&#x27;t say enough good things! Only possible bad thing is a slightly weird smell upon opening the package but this goes away after being out of the package for a little while. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE GREAT PRODUCT GREAT RESULTS!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really nice and soft. They do smell a bit but once you air them out the smell goes away. I was hoping a few of the smaller brushes would also be thinner. They&#x27;re too thick for eye shadow or eye lining</li>
    <li> Still are waiting to recieve these in the mail but from reading the reviews I already know this will be a great purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a surprisingly gorgeous and quality and worth the great price!</li>
    <li> Ordered Dec 4th shipped from china received Dec 11th! standard shipping :)China to Los Angeles! so great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just getting into brushes and I must say this is a great buy for the price and so many brushes.... flawlessly! I have a thicker concealer and it works wonders with it! I saw  cute white set which I wish this seller could offer but any who great great great! even their smaller brushes do the job! Yes they smell at first but so what they doo an amazing job! I will def buy again thank you!</li>
    <li> Apply the makeup very nicely , the bushes do not shed and for the price it&#x27;s great .</li>
    <li> great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Very soft and I use them every time I wear make up ❤</li>
    <li> Good product ordered a second set for a gift.</li>
    <li> Best brushes so far and I am obsessed. Soft. Didn&#x27;t even break me out.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best bargain I&#x27;ve ever had! Like this price for the quality is INSANE! I recommended them to my mom and she&#x27;s buying them also! Love love love</li>
    <li> These are very good brushes, I am so glad I purchased them. I love the range of types they have and the price point is unbeatable. They are so high quality, I am so glad I purchased them. Definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. I love them!</li>
    <li> Love my brushes great quality fast shipping</li>
    <li> These brushes came on time and they are soft...strong smell...but washed away with brush cleanser....great buy. ...gives you that flawless look.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes in the mail fairly quickly! They look just like the photo and are sooooo soft! I did experience a bit of a new smell to them once they were received, but I cleaned them right away and that eliminated the new smell. I did not experience any issues with the brush metal coming away from the wood handle. I have used them multiple times and love the flawless finish after applying my foundation or eye shadow. Great set for traveling!</li>
    <li> These are decent inexpensive brushes.  I used them mainly for foundation and concealer.  They do have a very strong smell coming out of the package.  Haven&#x27;t washed them much but I don&#x27;t expect them to last like MAC brushes</li>
    <li> great product, right price!</li>
    <li> I was taking them out of the packaging and one broke, plus I feel the eyeshadow brushes are too big for the eye</li>
    <li> Very nice, quality makeup brushes. Only wish it came with one of those big fluffy brushes is all! Not a big deal though. Very soft, worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great set of brush for the price.</li>
    <li> 6 of the brushes has come apart not worth the miney</li>
    <li> nice makeup brush set</li>
    <li> I loved them! I got them ahead of time which is great, thou when i opened the package it smelled awful but i gave them a good wash and the smell is gone</li>
    <li> I liked some of the brushes. The flat stippling brush is not dense enough and a couple of the smaller brushes are too hard and rough for my eye areas. Otherwise the angled eye brushes are pretty soft and the other big brushes are also nice. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I honestly am a little shocked at the great quality of these brushes because of the price. Super soft and makeup goes on flawlessly. A girl can never have too many makeup brushes!</li>
    <li> These are very steady, soft but not feather light soft where it wouldnt be effective for make up. All 10 are absolutely worth the money and then some!</li>
    <li> Great quality and affordable</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They work great for applying powder make up as well as liquid. They did have an odd smell to them, but once I washed them (only once so far) the smell went away. I would definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> Super soft yes. But the glue isn&#x27;t sturdy and they fall apart after a few washes.</li>
    <li> Wife loves them, work great</li>
    <li> I, (Brand new monkey&#x27;s gal) bought these a few months ago and after several uses and washes they are still holding up very well. They are so soft and give a flawless makeup application! YES, The handles are loose. Yes, you may have to use super glue or hot glue gun to reset the handles, but as far as I have seen, these are a very inexpensive dupe for my Sigma brushes!!  If it takes 10 minutes and saves me over $100.00 I have no problem re-gluing!! I Love the eye and concealer brushes too! First review I&#x27;ve written and I also just ordered a backup set of these!!! These are a STEAL! I have so many make up brushes that have cost me so much more &amp; they have shed like crazy! I have had ZERO SHEDDING with these in 3 months! Love them! They are a must and staple in everyone&#x27;s makeup bag/case!</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes for blending foundation, translucent face powder, and eyeshadows. I am so content with these that I no longer feel a need to purchase higher-end brushes. They do have a strong chemical smell at first, but it fades quickly. I even ordered a second set, and I would feel good ordering these as gifts.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I love doing my makeup and I like to use good quality brushes, I just don&#x27;t like to spend a ridiculous amount of money on brushes. Definitely worth the reasonable and affordable price, if not more! I&#x27;ve been looking for a good foundation brush and decided to try this set. Love Amazon, love these brushes and love whoever made them! :)</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price! I got them today, very soft and very thick. They do come out of the packaging having a sort of chemical smell to them. I think it&#x27;s just from them being packaged in plastic. I washed them in a mixture of shampoo and luke warm water and now they are clean and smell just fine! Very happy with these.</li>
    <li> Omg best inexpensive brushes ever&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend super soft&lt;br /&gt;Best money spent on amazon</li>
    <li> Good quality, Ill compare it to crown brushes but less dense. I really like it though, would def buy again! Also, good for beginners. Took a while to arrive but did come before the arrival date. Cute packaging too 👍</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes! Very good quality and super soft. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Veryy happy with my brushes!!! Soft yet dense! Perfect for foundation and the blending brushes aree sooo soft and blend shadows beautifully! !! Great brushes for the awesome priceee!</li>
    <li> Very nice👍👍I really like it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend buying the Sigma Kabuki Set. This is equally good and soft and perfect for foundation and contouring!</li>
    <li> Brushes came without a box at all, just in a clear sack, immediately saw loose hair, and there is no explanation what brush is for what, the 4 smaller brushes look identical, not as pictured.. I only bought these because of the great reviews but I got none of that greatness.. Wish i didn&#x27;t buy them..</li>
    <li> Soft and comfortable. Good quality brush and good price too.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I was skeptical just due to the price but I have been using them everyday for the past week and I&#x27;m OBSESSED!! They can easily blend out foundation, concealer and cream products in seconds. I use the smaller brushes on my eyes which are great blending brushes! I think this is definitely worth a try instead of spending $160 on the same set from Sigma! They are definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I love how these brushes feel! I cleaned them &amp; there was very little to none shedding. These brushes feel better than my MAC brushes! I&#x27;m super excited! Thanks for providing such a quality product at such a great price!</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes! They are super soft and apply makeup beautifully. Extremely luxurious!</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes for a great price! In love with all of them.</li>
    <li> Pretty good brushes. Only down side is a bit of fall out but for the price and application there good.</li>
    <li> Super cute and super soft. What I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Great brushes, recently received them and they were in perfect condition. Hopefully they last a long time:)</li>
    <li> I enjoy the brushes. I wish they had more smaller bushes. The brushes are much larger than the picture portrays.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!! So soft, but not too soft. Just right and the bristles aren&#x27;t itchy!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!! The best brushes I have ever had</li>
    <li> Very good brushes and fast shipping I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, flawless make-up using these plus so soft!!!!!!</li>
    <li> cant wait to use them.  came super fast and looks like they will hold up pretty well</li>
    <li> IT WAS A GREAT BRUSH TO USE!</li>
    <li> These brushes are so great! They are so soft and came before I was expecting. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for cheap and durable brushes</li>
    <li> This is amazing I don&#x27;t like a lot the brushes for the eyes but for the face it&#x27;s just amazing</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooo soft! They work wonderfully and have no complaints about the quality of these brushes. There were maybe one or two stray bristles on the top that I had to cut but thats it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if youre looking for precise eye brushes, these are definitely not it, because they&#x27;re a little big. Just a heads up in case you thought you were going to get detail brushes in this set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are SO SOFT!!!! Its crazy i looooooove these brushes to death, great at helping you blend your eyeshadow and came in wonderful condition ! Must buy (:</li>
    <li> These are great brushes, they did smell at first but after a quick wash with baby soap it went away. They are so soft!! &amp; no shedding!!!</li>
    <li> good quality and affordable!!! love them.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!! I absolutely love them except the flat top kabuki has already started to break after just a few weeks</li>
    <li> Best value for the price. Well made. Hairs do not fall out when using.They look nice too. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Pretty good brushes for the price! They shed a little bit but not much.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes they are really soft and work perfect for my everyday makeup looks, and their a Great Bargain!!!!</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time and each brush was individually wrapped. I noticed that the brushes were very soft. One of the brushes had a few hairs sticking up (far right) however it&#x27;s not a big problem.  The brushes also had a chemical smell to them but again it&#x27;s not a big issue for me.  The brushes were not labeled so I had to do some research.  I looked up Sigma &#x27;s essential kit of 10 brushes and labeled my brushes accordingly using some tape, a sharpie and an index card. Their website also provides a detailed description of each brush. I&#x27;m not comparing the two but I&#x27;m sure this will help someone who&#x27;s trying to figure out which brush is which. I will definitely be ordering another set for my sister.</li>
    <li> Overall first impression was excellent. I read a review that there is a chemical smell as soon you open them and boy were they right. I washed my brushes with baby soap and put drops of a strong essential oil in order to mask the original spray can smell. It worked and they dried well.  It didn&#x27;t take away all of the smell but did take most if it away. The pictures uploaded are prewash. I went to Sigma beauty and to identify the brushes and find out what each brush does. http://www.sigmabeauty.com/Individual_Brushes_s/51.htm</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sixteen year old niece as a nice starter set of makeup brushes.  The quality is very nice for the price.  My only complaint is that when I opened my page there was a very long black hair attached to the plastic.  That doesn&#x27;t seem very hygienic.  I have mid length blonde hair so it definitely wasn&#x27;t mine.  Overall I liked them and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Amazingly soft, the smell is not as bad as people make it out to be, fast shipping, great product!</li>
    <li> Love them I use one for my foundation its really good</li>
    <li> They are super soft and great quality but THEY SMELL SOO BAD!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes, they are soft, fluffy and they appear to be of good enough quality for the price. They came with a really strong chemical smell, but nothing that a good wash won&#x27;t fix. I&#x27;m training to be a makeup artist and can&#x27;t afford the sigma brushes, but I think these would do in the meantime. Everybody has said they make for really nice dupes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons I&#x27;m giving 3 stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Because the delivery time took longer than expected. About 4-5 days longer.&lt;br /&gt;- One of the brushes came kind of broken/cracked</li>
    <li> love them! Great quality!</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical because of the cheap price, but I figured it was worth trying for $11. I was more than pleasantly surprised. These brushes are so soft and feel like high quality. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes.  Good quality for my daughter.  Only wish it would come with a case to put them in.  Other than that good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> These are awesome, i bought some for myself and went back and bought some for my sister. They are so worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received them in 2 days.</li>
    <li> so far i love this brushes, they kind of have a smell to it but just wash them and that takes care of that.</li>
    <li> Every brush is individually packaged in their own plastic bag, which is nice. The brushes seem to be pretty sturdy and are very soft. None of the bristles came out when i used the brushes, so they don&#x27;t seen cheap</li>
    <li> Las recomiendo 100% son super suaves y excelentes para difuminar las amo!!! Y tan solo por $11. 99</li>
    <li> Not as soft as i&#x27;de hoped. Get what ya pay for...</li>
    <li> So soft and smooth and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> i really like these brushes. i thought that paying the amount i did would mean bad quality, but i was wrong, they are great. i am barely learning new ways to do my makeup since i have always been very plain and basic when it comes to it. one thing i wish for though, is a description of what each brush is meant for. i am still having a hard time figuring out what to use each brush for lol. other than that THEY ARE AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes a month ago and absolutely love them! They are so soft and distribute product perfectly. I am so happy with this purchase. I will definitely buy again. I do wish the brushes were labelled, but I still love them. They are also pretty easy to clean. I&#x27;ve had some that really don&#x27;t want to let go of product, but these do and they stay fresh. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these prices. I&#x27;ve been trying to find decent brushes at a reasonable price for months and these brushes definitely gave me exactly what I wanted. They hold product very well and have no fall out. All the brushes are incredibly soft and very durable. You get a lot of bang for your buck with these brushes. I would absolutely recommend these brushes and purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great brushes @ a great price!  Great quality &amp; Super soft!! I love them!</li>
    <li> Love them but they have a really soft chemical smell I use dish detergent to wash and problem solve.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes.  Great quality!</li>
    <li> thank you!! great product!!  brushes are a bit stiff. but no shedding</li>
    <li> Very nice, soft and dense! All the qualities I look for in makeup brushes</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t own these brushes, slap yourself back to reality and buy them now! They are sooo nice!  When I opened mine, I immediately washed them like others had suggested, but I never noticed any chemical smell from these brushes.  They are ridiculously good quality for the price you pay, and I&#x27;m in love with them!</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY BRUSHES!!! Thank you!!! They came in perfect conditions, they are sooo beautiful. I get so many compliments. :) :)</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes for a good price. They never shed and I use them daily</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing !!! They are very soft and blends very well</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!! So soft! So good just pure excellence!!!</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it was going to be.  I only use a couple of the brushes and the gold part of the handle gets loose so I am always trying to tighten up.</li>
    <li> Great quality and at an affordable price. Make up application went on smoothly and even. Another plus, I had no fall out with bristles while applying makeup or washing these brushes. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.they work fabulous . for a great price too.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my order. I ordered them in a hurry for sisters graduation gift and they came with a day and a half. I will definitely be ordering another set for myself.</li>
    <li> all the brushes in the picture came! they&#x27;re super soft and work really well! love em</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in desperate need of good brushes yet not wanting to pay a million bucks for them. At first the smell was a tad strong, but after a little bit of use the smell went away. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with these brushes. Very professional, soft, and good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I love make up and this brushes are greats</li>
    <li> I got my brushes in the mail few days ago and I loved them. There really soft, such easy to blend with. I would recommend this to everyone who ever wants to buy these. The price is really reasonable also.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. So far no shedding after a few weeks of use and very soft</li>
    <li> I typically use Sigma brushes and I was extremely hesitant to purchase this set. However, because of the price, I went ahead and bought. I&#x27;m very impressed with the brushes and variation of them, but displeased with the chemical stench that is on the brushes when you receive them. I went ahead and throughly washed the brushes and am hoping that they will smell better. Despite the disgusting smell, the brushes are very nice quality and great for bronzer, powder, eyes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE----&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for awhile now and really like them. The gross smell is completely gone and they work very well. I use them for everyday shadows and blush/bronzer.</li>
    <li> Best brushes for the price! Don&#x27;t fall apart at all!</li>
    <li> I loved them they did have a weird smell at first but the only problem with them is that after like 2 months they are falling off the stick</li>
    <li> I just got this, it smells a bit like acetone. They are really soft though.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, but they all have an awful smell and some of the hairs fell out upon use.</li>
    <li> good brushes to work with</li>
    <li> I think this was a good buy. The price is not bad and your also not left with some cheap brushes the hair on them don&#x27;t fall off when you put your makeup on as I have experienced before with other makeup. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try them because they have a strong oder, I am waiting for the oder to be less strong. Other than that I am content they came faster that I expected. Any recommendations on how to get rid of the smell?</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They have a lot of bristles and and well built. my only complaint is that when i first received the brushed they shed a little bit. but after i pulled out the stray hairs they were great. They don&#x27;t soak up all the product they haven&#x27;t shed since the first day and the eye blender brushes blend out eye shadows very well</li>
    <li> if you are skeptical, get over it. These brushes are amazing. Perfect for blending your make up. They do not shed at all! I use the flat one to apply liquid foundation and it is amazing. I also bought the Anastasia conture kit and it&#x27;s an amazing combo!</li>
    <li>  love these brushes dense and soft and I bet they will give u a best flawless looks with ur foundation..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can really recommend this brushes with all my girlfriends😍👍👍💗💗💗💗&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the shipping is so fast love it</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes!!! Very soft and a good variety. No lose bristles either!</li>
    <li> A bit flimsy like e.l.f brushes, but in all are great brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Been using them for a month now and I&#x27;m shocked at the good quality for the low price!</li>
    <li> Very soft bru dad&#x27;s hes but 2 of my hanldes were broken off when they arrived</li>
    <li> This is amazing blends really well</li>
    <li> I got this make up brush set a few months ago and decided to make a review because I find this make up brush set to be awesome! I have been using these brushes everyday and they&#x27;re doing a perfect job in making me beautiful!  They look very cute and the brush is very soft and dense. I use it to apply my liquid foundation or loose powder, to put on a blush, contouring and highlights. The small ones are good for putting and blending the eye make up.  I love that its sturdy enough and so far i havent experience the brush separating from the handle like the previews reviewers experienced. I did try to remove the handle from the brush so I can glue it back but I can&#x27;t even manage to remove it so that&#x27;s a plus on durability. It is synthetic so its going to smell like all synthetic brushes do but it eventually fades away. Now all I have to worry is to get a make up brush holder so I can bring these babies with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> Brushes arrived on time. Great purchase they are so soft</li>
    <li> They do the job.  No problems with strong smell, tops coming off or bristles coming out.  Packaged individually in plastic.  They have done well after being washed.  I&#x27;m happy with this set.</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist I approve The price is awesome super soft no fall out they get the job done of course I could find better but for the price i like them</li>
    <li> great brushes for the money,</li>
    <li> Lovely brushes for the price. I didn&#x27;t feel any odor coming from the brushes. The bristle really feel wonderful and it&#x27;s good quality for beginner and everyone else.</li>
    <li> AMAZING QUALITY! LOVE THESE BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like these.  The very first day, one of the brushes lost a ton of hair and I had to toss it.  The other brushes seem to be holding up just fine as of now.  I&#x27;ve had the brush set for about a month now.  I think its a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes much sooner than I expected and I love them! They are great quality and work well!</li>
    <li> Just got them in and they&#x27;re very sturdy and soft so im sure blending and application will be a breeze. I tried taking them apart to further seal them with hot glue from a hot glue gun but it won&#x27;t budge so I won&#x27;t worry about trying to. They do have a strong smell so I&#x27;ll be sure to clean them before actually using them.</li>
    <li> These are some of my favorite brushes ever. The round-top and flat-top foundation brushes from this set are perfect for foundation and the price is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Great quality great price.</li>
    <li> Was a little concerned about the synthetic brush hairs being stiff. But this set is the perfect blend of soft and firm. Easy to clean and it holds color well. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The brushes don&#x27;t shed. They&#x27;re very sturdy. I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> These brushes are THE best. I would recommend buying these now. The price is super cheap for such great quality. I would say to wash them before using them of course. I use the smaller ones to blend out my concealer and to blend my eye shadows. I would compare these to Sigma brushes and BH cosmetics brushes also. Very good quality for the price you pay!</li>
    <li> Update: Brushes start to fall apart after washing. It&#x27;s worth spending a little more on good brushes if you want brushes that last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes feel very nice, only downfall is when applying makeup at times the hairs come out of two of the eye makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t expect these brushes to be the highest quality for the low price, but I am quite pleased just the same.  The brush I chose to apply my blush comes apart from where the wooden handle meets the metal, so I have to be careful how I hold it when using.  Other than that, I&#x27;ve only used a couple so far and am very happy with them.  Lots of choices!</li>
    <li> surprisingly enough, I actually like these. I didn&#x27;t expect much for the cheap price tag but was pleasantly surprised as I have worked with them and found they really do hold and distribute product well.  I would recomment. Wash and wash and wash again when you first get them cause they stink a little....but I have not experiences any hair fall out after 5 washes which is nice and my client the other day comment that she &amp;#34;loved the way they feel&amp;#34;.....so thats a good thing.  hope you all have a similar positive experience!&lt;br /&gt;love and light~</li>
    <li> it was a gift for my girlfriend she love them</li>
    <li> the brushes last a long time. do not clump from the foundation. like more than the 30$ for a single brush at Sephora&lt;br /&gt;i have now purchased this item for myself, two coworkers, and now one coworker asked me to order for her sisters.</li>
    <li> I ordered my brushes June 21st and got them June 23rd. I got them quicker then I expected. I LOVE THEM this is not a fake comment these brushes look very nice, they are very soft and I appreciate the quality. Brand new and unique used I recommend anyone to purchase these brushes their worth it! They look short but, they are very much long the normal brush size!</li>
    <li> I really really wanted a affordable brush set to apply my makeup. However when these arrived there was a strong chemical smell like they were just bleached I really don&#x27;t know however I decided to leave them out in the air to see if anything would change IT DID NOT. I had an event to go to and against my better judgement I used these brushes on my face and my face BURNED ME. Few days later my face is stripping. The price is just awesome but right now my face is stripping :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> Best brushes around! I would recommend these to everyone</li>
    <li> The brushes are soooo soft, yet dense. You can tell they&#x27;re durable. At first they come with a weird smell, but after an hour airing out the smell disappears. One of the bigger brushes broke within twenty minutes of un packing. But this wasn&#x27;t too much of a big deal to me I just added some crazy glue and stuck it back on, I tried to pull the other wood pieces off the gold handles and they wouldn&#x27;t budge so I&#x27;m guessing it was just that one. If your having trouble guessing which one is for what just reference them with the sigma 10 piece brush set, these are identical! That&#x27;s what I did, I labeled them with a p-touch but you can do it with paper tape and marker as well. Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptic to buy this product because it was cheap, but I read the reviews so why not give it a try? I ordered these and these came in pretty quick! It smells weird at first, but that&#x27;s because of the packaging. I made sure I washed my brushes and swiped a little bit of alcohol on the bristles before I used it on clients. I didn&#x27;t get to use them on my face yet, but I have used it on clients. Everyone said that the bristles are extremely soft so yay for that! If you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the difference of a regular face brush and a synthetic face brush, a regular face brush usually absorbs the foundation/concealer (which is not really good because you waste more foundation) whereas a synthetic brush grabs the foundation and leaves it on the surface of the bristles. The application is absolutely flawless and I&#x27;m very pleased with this since these brushes are cheap compared to MAC and sephora. The smaller brushes are great for contouring, highlighting, and putting powder. My only con is that the larger face brushes are so hard to clean if you use a liquid/heavy cream foundation. I can clean the smaller brushes with a daily brush spray. I usually have to deep cleanse the larger ones for the foundation to come out, but I really don&#x27;t mind it. I have the patience for it. Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth to buy.</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price. The come off the handle, but not anything you can&#x27;t glue back down.</li>
    <li> Quality was disappointing.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE - FEELS GREAT AND BLENDS MY MAKEUP PERFECTLY</li>
    <li> Believe the hype! I couldn&#x27;t believe the good quality of this set and at such a ridiculously great price. I&#x27;ve paid for brushes at Sephora, Sonia Kushak (Target), Real Techniques, and others online. Thought I&#x27;d take a gamble with these and loved them! Very soft and great for applying powders.</li>
    <li> I really like them! Very soft &amp; applied foundation and other makeup very smoothly. Delivered on time, but I have Amazon prime so of course I get 2-day shipping. Not sure how long the shipping would be without prime. Anyways, I really like them!😁</li>
    <li> The price is great but you do get what you pay for. The little brushes seem to be useless but the bigger brushes are totally worth the purchase. Out of all these brushes I only have use for the bigger ones. Still I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wash the brushes when they arrive, but like the other reviews said these brushes are very soft and work well!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to spend 60 dollars on makeup brushes. These work just as good. Just wash them with a mild dish soap, some water and let them air dry when they get dirt. Please don&#x27;t go spending all your hard earned money on over priced products. These brushes and soft and get the job done.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t brat for the price, thick pretty good quality brushes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with how fast these got here! Ordered them Friday night and they got here Monday morning. And they&#x27;re such good quality, and so soft!</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, that&#x27;s all there is to it.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Not good quality handles. The glue came undone and the handles break easily.</li>
    <li> I love them!! They are great quality and for that price I think I&#x27;m order a pair more for my sisters.  I give it 10 stars if possible👌👌</li>
    <li> Love them!! These are a great value, and they work great as well. No need to spend tons of money on other brands when you can get a lot of brushes for the same price!</li>
    <li> great quality brush set! I am very pleased with them. They are super soft and pack on pigment for the eyes. And I like how the foundation brush is not super dense which can take all your foundation away from your face. The only negative side is the brush set is not labeled but I just compared them to the sigma essentials brush set and that worked for me! Over all I&#x27;m very happy with them and will be getting another set from them shortly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely recommend these!&lt;br /&gt;They arrived way sooner than I expected as they came from China. It said I was supposed to get them after a month but I got them within a day of my other package from California (about a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have a very strong smell but it&#x27;s nothing when you compare it to the quality of the product and honestly it&#x27;s not bad. It just smells like plastic or actual paint brushes from a hardware store haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes made my makeup go on flawlessy despite my foundation being a non brush or sponge application type.&lt;br /&gt;I used baby skin pore corrector, dream wonder foundation, and super stay 24 concealer all from Maybelline. Not expensive stuff but it looked like I had a professional do my makeup when I was done. My skin was not cakey looking what so ever and the makeup wore all through work whereas it never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the brushes apply an even amount of coverage all over without leaving any streaks. They&#x27;re a must buy!</li>
    <li> I love how it is not wasting my product</li>
    <li> I received these as a gift and would definitely buy another set if I ever happened to lose my own. These are really nice (and very affordable!) brushes for anyone starting out or someone that has been doing makeup for years. These would make nice, inexpensive additions to a makeup artist&#x27;s kit. The face-specific brushes, the larger ones, have a nice surface area; they apply powders, creams, gels, etc. very nicely. The eye brushes, too, save for the flat-top &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; type brush which is the only blunder in the kit, apply shadows nicely. They do have a chemical smell to them once you open their wrappers but after a quick wash, they&#x27;re fine. These are surprisingly sturdy, put-together very well, and would please just about anyone looking for brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brush,thank you.</li>
    <li> Love them! Had a weird smell but once I washed them in it went away!</li>
    <li> The package arrived very fast! Brushes felt very soft to touch. Only con is the strong chemical smell which can be resolved with mild soap and water. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Given as a Christmas gift.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I almost threw them out the second I opened the package because the absolute STENCH of chemicals was overwhelming!! I nearly gagged! My dog was sitting near me and even he made a face and walked away! I had to wash these brushes THREE TIMES with brush cleaner and water to get most of the smell off of them, and even still it&#x27;s lingering. The brushes themselves work pretty well, very minimal shedding and they don&#x27;t eat the product. I just wish they didn&#x27;t have that horrible horrible strong chemical smell. Blegh.</li>
    <li> Great price for these brushes. Good quality. Soft and doesn&#x27;t fall out too.</li>
    <li> The brushes were so soft I loved them!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes, timely delivery!</li>
    <li> I would give this product a five star but one of the brushes came and it wasn&#x27;t glued right and the handle part came off but other than that they are awesome!!</li>
    <li> It was nice and soft, I love my make-up brushes :)</li>
    <li> Loved my brushes. No loose hairs/fibers and super soft on my skin. I only wished it had more eye brushes.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes perfect</li>
    <li> These feel so well in your hands. And they are so soft. They can practically be confused for expensive brand named brushes.</li>
    <li> Just got the brushes today! But it have a bad paint/ink smell to it .. Hopefully when I wash them the smell will go away ..</li>
    <li> Wish the brushes were labeled, I have no idea what brushes are used for what</li>
    <li> I like these brushes.</li>
    <li> Im in love with this set!! Brushes r sooo soft,and shipping was quick!</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and MAC</li>
    <li> this is a really good set for it&#x27;s price.  I love make up and I have sigma and mac brushes.  This was a nice gift but I really do like it.  The flat top stippling  brush is amazing.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. Brushes are soft yes but the handles fell off, brushes shedding and others put together crooked. I did try to fix one but it came out worse and turned into a whole new brush. Doubt I can return these now but these were pretty cheap. I did notice that the glue to hold it together were all collected on one side instead of going all around....yup cheap.</li>
    <li> The brushes are wonderful!! They have a slight odor to them but they are very good quality and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft! The quality is super good for the price that was paid. However, I was especially excited for the large tapered brush, but was disappointed because it wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;tapered&amp;#34; shaped like how I expected.</li>
    <li> Best Amazon purchase ever! Ordered them Friday night and received them on Sunday. Very soft and no shedding so far.</li>
    <li> Such a great buy! I did smell the smell some people have complained of, but with a couple days in my makeup case, it wore off. These are amazing brushes. They&#x27;re very high quality for the price!</li>
    <li> I am truly blown away by these brushes. For the $10 I paid for them (only $1 a brush), I cannot believe how high quality they are. They are thick, quite dense, and incredibly soft. There were only a few loose hairs when they arrived, and I removed them and washed the brushes. I have had no issues with shedding since then (though they are only a month old, so I will revise this if it becomes an issue with time). They are much higher quality than my drugstore brushes, but admittedly, I do not own high end brushes to compare them to. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I originally gave these brushes 5 stars, but I have changed my mind. I bought these in January, so I&#x27;ve only been using them for 2 months at most, and it hasn&#x27;t been every day use. I washed these brushes a total of 3 times, and tonight while washing them I noticed some shedding on the flat top kabuki brushes. I still do enjoy the brushes, they&#x27;re very sleek looking and quite dense, although I am pretty disappointed with the shedding. But for $12 what can ya expect?</li>
    <li> These brushes are better than most of my higher-end brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reach for these before the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great addition to my kit.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of the brushes. Synthetic brushes normally don&#x27;t feel this way. After I washed the brushes for the second time, the brush head fell off! I just bought crazy glue and glued it back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love them!</li>
    <li> One of the brushes came detached. Other than the one brush they are all very nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Great wife loved them.....holding up just fine....</li>
    <li> Shipped really fast.. And brushes look great! Very soft! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with these brushes! Im very satisfied with the quality! I love the eyeshadow brushes they work amazing! The only downside was the awful smell when they arrived. However, after washing them only once the smell went away! So it js deff worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> For the price, the quality is stunning. The smell is a bit off putting but just wash them and you&#x27;ll be good to go! Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! Awesome blending brushes.</li>
    <li> I got my broshes theyre nice but where the golden thing was that attached to the handle were comepletely apart for 2 of them</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes is surprisingly good. I use them a lot and have had no bristle loss.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes I&#x27;m not a makeup expert so am not sure what they are all supposed to be used for but they have made a huge difference in helping me apply my makeup and they seem to be made of quality materials.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and not worth your money, spend a little more and get a good product</li>
    <li> Very soft and sturdy! BEWARE STRING CHEMICAL SMELL WHEN OPENED! After a wash they were fine. Would possibly by again if desperate.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft, that probably surprised me the most. When I got them I washed them immediately and I did notice some shedding especially with the flat top! For the price I can&#x27;t really complain ( don&#x27;t worry the shed wasn&#x27;t that bad, but a couple of bristles did fall out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s worth the money you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are dense ( wish they were a little bit more tho). They blend beautifully, I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a comparison, I&#x27;ll probably compare these to the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have struggled to find makeup brushes that didn&#x27;t feel as if they were scratching my skin. These are soft as silk, great quality and a pleasure to use. When they arrive they do have a faint smell that is most likely from the glue used on them. After a quick light wash with some mild castille soap the smell was gone. I was also impressed that when I washed them, there was no fiber loss from the brushes! Huge plus!</li>
    <li> Am totally in love with this brushes they really set the make up well and don&#x27;t make me look cakey.... really worth the price... great qulity got such a low price...</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I decided to make the inexpensive purchase along with a hot glue gun to reinforce the glue in the ferrels (as another reviewer recommended). As I expected, the handles EASILY came off the ferrels (the metal parts) on all the brushes, and I noticed there was very little glue holding the fibers in there. So with my hot glue gun, I went on the glue the handles back on. It was a messy process, but they ended up being good brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you will not be regluing the handles before using these, don&#x27;t buy them. They will quickly fall apart!</li>
    <li> Love my brushes good material my make up comes out much more smoothed 💛</li>
    <li> Umm they&#x27;re pretty much alright. The packaging was really nice. Everything was covered in these little plastic slips. But, some of the brushes were slightly deformed and lopsided. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> So soft, durable, and versatile.  Best purchase.  Well made, but inexpensive.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! I love how soft they are. The bristles do not fall out. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> i like the brushes i just feel that so many of them are the same size with almost the same size tips and i didnt know which brush was for what..</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes basid on reviews and rating&#x27;s. For the price its not so bad. Their soft and a good amount of brushes. Only thing that sucked was pulling them out the individual bag the brush broke off!</li>
    <li> Nice product, shipping was super fast. Good quality brushes and yes I would buy again</li>
    <li> Nice set and sweet deal!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant because of the price, usually you get what you pay for, and that was not the case, these brushes are so soft and they don&#x27;t shed, there is a strong chemical smell when you first open them but that fades quickly. These are by far the best brushes I own. So happy with this purchase. Will recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> These brushes are magic! Soft well made</li>
    <li> They have smell and brushes not labeled</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t labeled which is I dont mind.&lt;br /&gt;The smell however I can not stand.  Maybe it was a cleanser they used. A couple of the brushes came lose, and as I opened them I automatically noticed loose hair. I am unsatisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first set of brushes and I love them. I can&#x27;t justify (an neither can my wallet) buying really expensive Sigma, Mac, or Sephora brushes for that matter. I love makeup but not enough to throw a couple hundred on brushes alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome. They are soft and help me blend my makeup well. I feel that maybe the eye brushes are a little too big but then again I do have small eyes and I have never owned a high end makeup brush in my life so I guess I don&#x27;t have an honest opinion on the matter.</li>
    <li> Really love these brushes. Arrived quickly. Good quality and meets almost all of your makeup application needs. Was initially put off by the smell when they arrived. After washing an about 2 days, the smell went away. Wish the brow brush comb was included to complete the set. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Very surprised on the quality but had a horrible paint smell when they arrived and tried to wash it out..helped a bit.</li>
    <li> They are very soft and nice! Good brushes for the price</li>
    <li> these brushes are very soft and I love them</li>
    <li> Better than expected, soft bristles &amp; decent quality. Much better than the elf &amp; coastal scents bushes I have been using! Only vice is the smell, but it does go away once you give them a good deep cleaning! Only had a couple of hairs shed when using the flat kabuki with my foundation the first time but that&#x27;s to be expected!</li>
    <li> These are amazing  quality!  I was amazed  because  of their price,  better then my expensive  Professional ones.&lt;br /&gt;Does have a smell to them but leaving out in the open a day it was gone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so surprised that it makes such a difference to use these make up brushes!!  Love them!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. they aren&#x27;t as good as sigma or other expensive brushes but they do a great job. The delivery was fast and got here earlier than expected</li>
    <li> Package was delivered as promised, even on a Sunday, so I was pleased with that. However, only after one use my flat top Kabuki brush started shedding. That was disappointing, so that&#x27;s why I rate 3 stars.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very close to the sigma brushes. I love them!! especially because these are good quality brushes for a great price! I totally recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I have ever used.  They are softer and more dense than my mac brushes.  I did have to superglue the handle back on to one but I don&#x27;t even mind.  The price for the quality of the brush is amazing and unlike anything else I&#x27;ve found.  They are soft and deliver a perfect application.  I will be re-ordering more.</li>
    <li> There seriously is no need to spend $20 + on a SINGLE brush. Although I don&#x27;t have very many uses for all of the brushes, the main ones I do use are GREAT! Very soft.. and like many other reviewers.. factory smell when they first arrived, that actually went away after leaving the brushes on my table for the day. Soft and dense I should add.. for the amount of money paid, you just can&#x27;t complain. Oh, and fast shipping BTW.. that&#x27;s always a plus!</li>
    <li> I received these brushes about 2 weeks ago. I did my research on brushes for about a week before I finally decided to go with these ones. The price is amazing for what you get and they arrived within several days I believe, which was nice since I ordered several other makeup items, all of which are taking a month to arrive! Anyhow, I had read a couple reviews about the brushes bristles falling out so I was a little nervous, but it&#x27;s been 2 weeks and mine are still in excellent and working great! I love these brushes and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I am completely in love with these brushes!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes ! Wish a eyebrow brush was added!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous! They blend to perfection! I could not ask for better brushes. I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and self proclaimed makeup addict and at first I thought this deal was too good to be true but I ordered anyway. The flat top kabuki and angled kabuki are my faves but they all work beautifully. I&#x27;m sold! :) Run, don&#x27;t walk to this deal before it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> the brushes are super soft. and the quality and price for them just perfect!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality. Super soft bristles. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> They some good brushes only thing I hated there were no names on them to tell what kind of brushes they are.</li>
    <li> great for the price. the handle did come off if a few of them but i glue gunned it back. washes nicely. doesn&#x27;t shed!</li>
    <li> very bad for face smell bad big brushes are ok they are very soft but the small one are bad all around the cut texture shape all wrong don&#x27;t waste your time or money</li>
    <li> she love her make up brushes</li>
    <li> too puffy, too big, smeel weird, they are not easy to work with</li>
    <li> These are far from premium brushes. They smell horrendous &amp; do not blend well at all. They streak your makeup &amp; the bristles fall out constantly. Also one of the brushes separated from the wooden handle after a couple of uses. I was trying them with different platforms thinking maybe they would be better with powder VS liquid, etc....NO they are not good with anything. They would only be useful for a tween or teen beginner with makeup that has yet to discover the differences or how to properly care for brushes to make them last. Otherwise they are useless.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife, she didnt like it but I take it more of her preference than anything wrong with the brushes.</li>
    <li> Loveeeee my brushes. So soft!! I recommend?</li>
    <li> These r great very soft like I wanted them to be</li>
    <li> Almost identical to the sigma kabuki set! I was concerned that for the price I wouldn&#x27;t be able to blend liquid foundation with it but it blends seamlessly! The brushes are so soft. I recommend washing them before you use them. They came packaged individually &amp; that&#x27;s something I really appreciate. Overall, very amazing brushes and great for beginners!</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy this product again</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price! They have been solid and held up really well, no shedding except the one brush that I&#x27;ve really been hard on for several months, and they&#x27;re nice and soft, perfect stiffness in each specific brush. Will buy this set again when my current set have been worn out, which will probably be a while yet!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve never written a review before. These brushes are so good! They do have a smell, but giving them a quick wash quickly removes it. Plus we should wash our brushes before putting them on our faces, shouldn&#x27;t we fellow makeup lovers? :) the best part about this however is how quickly they came in and how nice the seller was to me! Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Wow these brushes are AMAZING, they are super soft even after you wash them a couple times. They come individually wrapped which is awesome. At first when you open them up they do have a bit of a bad smell, but once you wash them it goes away instantly. I will be buying more. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. It uses the eye-shadow well and doesn&#x27;t make it messy..the blending is good and even. Very good quality, very unbelievable for the price.</li>
    <li> I got 12 brushes instead of 10 LOL i got a gel eyeliner brush and i forgot what the other one was but i just tried out these brushes and i love them.</li>
    <li> So I read the reviews more thoroughly after I had already purchased these and was a bit concerned about the packaging of the brushes but no, they came in a box that was spacious and had bubble wrap along with the brushes in a bag and individually wrapped! So the packaging was awesome. I got an email after I purchased them from the seller about letting them know if there&#x27;s anything wrong, which was awesome so thanks for that!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are extremely soft and dense, I love them!!!! I have the gold and black and I can honestly say I prefer them to my Mac and sigma, mostly because the price but also because the quality is amazing!! The smell went away after my first wash and the brushes are still soft! If you&#x27;d like to see what they came in feel free to look me up on IG with the same sn as on here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my reviews helps, you don&#x27;t want to miss out on these before they become a higher price (like sigma, bhcosmetics. Etc)</li>
    <li> I loooovveee these brushes I can&#x27;t believe how great they work. They are so soft and feels great on my face. I wanted the sigma brushes but they are too expensive. These brushes are amazing.</li>
    <li> i got more brushes then they said i got twelve so i love it</li>
    <li> The handles fell off the brushes a week after I received them.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m incredibly happy. They apply makeup really well and pick up the perfect amount from eyeshadow palettes etx</li>
    <li> Great quality, the price is unbeatable, easy to clean and look incredibly sophisticated</li>
    <li> Great for blending foundation and concealer.</li>
    <li> I have never been so happy about a purchase. These lovely brushes really do compare to the Real Techniques &amp; Sigma brushes. You CANNOT beat the price like COME ON you would be a fool not to get them. Best thing I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon so far. The seller is so sweet and really cares about the customer. The brushes are so incredibly soft and nice looking. There are few stray hairs but you can easily trim those and then voila good to go. I didn&#x27;t experience an odd smell. DO NOT MISS OUT ON THESE AMAZING DUPE BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> I Looooove The Hell Out Theses Brushes...</li>
    <li> I was worried about the quality of these brushes when I ordered them because even though you read so many amazing reviews which get you excited, you never know right? Let me tell you, these brushes are 100% phenomenal, and for the price they are an absolute steal. These cosmetic brushes (when they arrived each brush was individually protected by a plastic slip) are of an amazing quality, and within my second week of using them, I have yet to see barely any hairs fall out or any other product damage otherwise. If you&#x27;re on a budget like me and refuse to blow so much money on high - end, brand name brushes for quadruple the price, stop your search right here because these brushes are your answer. They carry and disperse your makeup products evenly, the hairs have a perfect combination of flexibility and stiffness, and you get a variety of brushes for several purposes (blush, bronzer, concealer, setting powder, etc.) I am so happy with this product, A+.</li>
    <li> I came across the brushes while looking for a set that was decently priced as well as higher quality. I didn&#x27;t expect much when I purchased these, but WOW was I surprised when they arrived. AMAZING quality. They do have somewhat of a chemical smell to them, but it went away after a day of airing them out. I even bought a second set in silver.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, giving you a flawless look. I use them for contouring. It is perfect.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great for the price. Soft and full bristles! Did arrive with a strong chemically smell, allow to air out once they arrive.</li>
    <li> great brushes for this price, love them</li>
    <li> Unbelievable deal. Excellent quality. I almost spent about $200 on a set of IT brushes I fell in love with. These feel as soft as the brushes on display at Ulta. So glad my daughter found these and we tried these first. Chemical smell wears off quick, probably the wrapping or the glue.</li>
    <li> It is worth the money.. They come in about 3-5 days.. I am into makeup and I wanted a good set of brushes, this product was it for me. They can be compared to Sephora&#x27;s line of brushes..</li>
    <li> I washed them as soon as i got it, just to make sure it was free of harsh chemicals, and as i started to use it on my face, the bristles in the domed kabuki came out, and i dont know how to stop it! shucks... but nonetheless, pretty good deal if you ask me!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!! They are soft and blend makeup just as good as Sigma or Mac brushes for a fraction of the price. The only down side is you have to wash them upon arrival because of a chemical smell but other than that they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> So I thought because of having such high reviews that these brushes would be great; but was I mistaken! I was extremely disappointed when these arrived today! First, they were in a clear bag which is crappy, I though it would at least be in a cheap case; oh well, not a big deal! Second, I take them out &amp; they smell so awful, which I&#x27;m not going to put that smell crap on my face! Third, I start looking at the brushes &amp; they look exactly the same! There is no guide to tell you which brush is which but I guess that doesn&#x27;t matter seeing how you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell! All the brushed except for the point one look the same, &amp; it barely looks different! In the pictures they show on here, they all look different but not in person! Yes, they are super soft but they also aren&#x27;t sturdy! I will be returning theses &amp; I will go buy quality! Don&#x27;t believe these reviews; esp. if you&#x27;re very picky &amp; want your make up to look good!</li>
    <li> I like the brush&#x27;s but I received the wrong ones I got silver ones instead but no big deal and the brush hair dose shad a bit but other then That they work really well I washed them before using because of the smell  but it wasn&#x27;t real bad like review said&lt;br /&gt;They still apply your makeup flawless</li>
    <li> I love that they are so soft and the way the look is great</li>
    <li> These are perfect. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Happy with my product.</li>
    <li> Easily broke cheap product</li>
    <li> THIS IS A COMPLETE AMAZING DEAL.... can i first say that WOW just 11 dollars for these brushes! amazing quality and they look super expensive but there not ;)&lt;br /&gt;they are basically every essential brush in one pack!&lt;br /&gt;U GOTTA BUY THIS!!! I LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping to England. Amazing brushes - They are nice and soft. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love them! Use &#x27;em everyday!!!</li>
    <li> For the most part, these are great. The only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars is because one of the handles of the brushes fell out before I even used it. I stuck it back in and it hasn&#x27;t fallen out again... So it&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> I showed this brush to my MUA cousin, and she said it was very good quality and very comparable to the Sigmax essential brush kit for $150! If she didn&#x27;t know better, she&#x27;d think it was sigma brushes! She&#x27;s thinking of ordering one for herself!&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the smell. But after a couple days airing it out, it&#x27;s gone!&lt;br /&gt;Also, when you wash your brushes, make sure the water doesn&#x27;t get past the metal handle because that loosens up the glue and breaks it apart.&lt;br /&gt;Since the brushes are so dense, it dries for a long time when on the side. I bought a brush drying rack and dry it upside down with the bristles facing down. Now, I wash it at night, it&#x27;s dried and ready to use in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> For the price these brushes are pretty good quality, they are sift and blend makeup very well! Great for contouring, the only problem I seen was the black handle comes attached easy from the gold part, but nothing a strong glue couldn&#x27;t fix.. As a professional makeup artist I definitely think these brushes are worth the money! :)</li>
    <li> Loved it!! The brushes are soft and durable. Arrived on time. So far no shedding. Only problem is that they smell weird, but I always wash all my new brushes with baby shampoo! I&#x27;d def recommend them.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes two days ago, I ordered them the 26th, and recieved the 29th. It was super quick and I was extremely excited to come home and see them waiting for me. I&#x27;ve used two of the smaller brushes so far, and I&#x27;m already in love. They come individually packaged, which is great and they may smell when first arriving but after using them they smell fine.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> best dupe for sigma brushes</li>
    <li> Soft and easy to clean and they do not lose their softness. Love these!</li>
    <li> I researched makeup brushes and have used so many different brands over the years. I am so shocked how amazing these brushes are especially for the price! Do not waste your money on more expensive brushes, these are amazing!!!</li>
    <li> So first off, these brushes are extremely SOFT! I want to brush it against my face forever because it feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge variety of brushes, just not enough variety in the small brushes side (for example for eyeliner or a small smudge brush) but a lot of different big ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package though, it did smell like PAINT. Your room will literally stink of very very strong paint smell when you open up the bag full of brushes. It stinks... That&#x27;s the only complaint I have. I guess you have to wash it thoroughly before you use it or else you&#x27;re gonna have to hold your breath or something... O.o</li>
    <li> If yall wanna see what they look like and how they go on. I made a get ready with me video using those. Here is the link ! http://youtu.be/6-HOlCYoOoo</li>
    <li> Got this set for Christmas. The brushes were a little larger than I expected but very soft and work well. Sadly, the handles on TWO of the large brushes have come off - they separated from the brush just below the metal ring. I think I can reattach them with hot glue but still, not cool.</li>
    <li> Love these! Plus theyre gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Just got my brushes and am very happy with the  just that do have a sell on paint but bisides that there pretty good</li>
    <li> Very awesome. I keep these with my other brushes. Soft and so worthy. This would be a must addition to your collection.</li>
    <li> Great for contouring!</li>
    <li> So I got these in today February 10 and they are so nice they are very very good quality the brushes are really thick and fluffy The quality is great I can&#x27;t wait to try am the only thing I would like to say about I the brushes I would like for them to have written down what for each brush dose</li>
    <li> Better then bh brushes!</li>
    <li> Best brushes ive ever purchased doesnt even shed love them the foundation look perfect</li>
    <li> brushes are soft, but after one use all of them have fallen off the handle, had to reglue them.</li>
    <li> Just received these in the mail. I can&#x27;t deny that they had a pretty strong and stingy chemical smell when i opened them. I had to thoroughly wash them with a nice smelling shampoo to get rid of the smell. But ladies, once u get past that, the brushes are extremely smooth. Simply love them. cant wait to start using them. Definitely the best for the price !</li>
    <li> I like these brushes, their soft and big. They had a smell like paint or something even after i wased them so had to wash them again. But overall i love them</li>
    <li> Great product just got it a few days, really easy to wash off the makeup.</li>
    <li> Soft dense brushes and so affordable, much much less than Sigma brushes.  I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes. It&#x27;s so soft and gentle to use on my face. It&#x27;s affordable for the quantity of brushes.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE BRUSHES!! What a great buy!!! Super soft and no lose hairs!! Used them now a handful of times on me and my clients! Love them!! Way better that the ones I got from sephoria!</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are amazing, for the price you are getting them for they are worth it. I was a but skeptical at first but I mean for the price I shouldn&#x27;t expect more from it, but nevertheless they became my absolute favorite brushes right now. I have to rave more about how fast it was shipped.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They are a dream for blending! I absolutely love them. The bristles stay put and don&#x27;t end up all over my face and are overall good quality for the price. The only complaint I have is that one of the smaller brushes broke. I guess the glue wasn&#x27;t as strong and so the brush fell off of the stick. I only had that issue with one brush.</li>
    <li> The one brush sheds like no tomorrow...don&#x27;t know how to fix it</li>
    <li> They are ok one so far one of the brushes fall apart and I have used the only once</li>
    <li> Great brushes and with prime the brushes come quick! perfect amount of brushes in a set!</li>
    <li> Helps makeup go on so smoothly and helped me achieve that flawless look I was going for, I love um love I&#x27;m love um💕&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re very soft to the touch and easy to clean, I&#x27;m glad I found these brushes versus going to Sephora and ulta</li>
    <li> The set comes in a cute bag.  The brushes are made well, for the price and amount of brushes, you cannot do better!  Would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this brush set. They all are incredibly soft and they arrived on time. I did have trouble with the larger angled brush shedding a lot and they all have a chemically smell to them, but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me. All in all, they were worth the money</li>
    <li> So far exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome, with a great soft texture that does the job beautifully. Would definetly buy again.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes!</li>
    <li> I like this brushes.but they don&#x27;t have flat eyeshadow brush.they give 4 blending brush,little disappointing</li>
    <li> Man brushes are great.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell you how much I love these brushes! I was very hesitate because of the price,  but was very impressed! They have now been washed 3 times and are still staying together perfectly. I have high end make up brushes and in my personal opinion I think they compare. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Very nice, one brush head has fallen off. These are my go-to</li>
    <li> Incredibly soft! Definitely worth the purchase- I was blown away by the quality!!</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box the brushes smelled really bad like paint. I had to air them out for 2 weeks by the sun close to a window. They are really soft fee nice on the skin I thought I was really going to like them but after the 4 time I used them the handle fell off from 3 of the brushes. Very disappointed I wish the seller will contact me maybe I Just got some bad ones.</li>
    <li> These brushes are SO beautiful and feel very high quality. I cant believe they were only $11!! They were also delivered way sooner than I expected. It cant get any better than that!</li>
    <li> They arrived as expected but came with a very harsh chemical smell.  I washed them with soap and water and all is well</li>
    <li> Just okay.  The brushes are fine but too many are very similar.  Very full and fluffy</li>
    <li> I love this set! It&#x27;s perfect for the prize!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these brushes! Unlike other reviewers, I adore these brushes! They are everything you are looking for when it comes to applying foundation, blush, bronzer, and highlighter! They are dense, soft, and apply liquid foundation like a dream, leaving a flawless finish. Perhaps, it comes down to the seller you are purchasing from because mine did not detach from the wooden handle however it did have a factory smell to it which many were complaining of but wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;offensive&amp;#34; as I thought and went away with a simple cleaning. The seller I chose and recommend to have the same value of brushes is sweet lemon! To give you a comparison of how these brushes feel, think of the ones at Sephora, Ulta, or MAC! That nice! And yes, I did receive all 10! :D</li>
    <li> This is a really great brush set for the price and would be great for someone just starting out. I use the big brushes for foundation mostly and don&#x27;t feel bad about not washing them right away. Which I do for my other expensive brushes. They do have a very strong factory/chemical odor to them when you first get them but if you wash the handle of the brush as well as the bristles it will go away.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes the only downfall about them was the smell. (Very strong glue smell) I think..... other Than that, love em!</li>
    <li> Really nice brushes. Don&#x27;t shed. Very soft. Kinda have this industrial smell. But doesn&#x27;t bother me or my makeup. Definitely buying again</li>
    <li> I love them so much No ugly smell and they are so soft!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes! At first I was skeptical about purchasing but i watched a few reviews via youtube and had to purchase. Many people compare these brushes to the sigma kabuki set. They are soft and have great density which is great for blendidn liquid or cream makeup. I had very little to no shedding and a flawless face when finished with my look. I am deffinately gonna order another set because $15 is a steal for sigma dupes!</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes in the mail today and all I can say is OMG♡♡♡ I am obsessed! 😍 I couldn&#x27;t wait to do my makeup just so I could try them out...I have so many brushes from other places and these by far are my favs. Im going to order more just for backup..Great buy👍👌</li>
    <li> These brushes are truly as amazing as all the positive reviews say they are!  Mine came well packaged (individually wrapped) and with no chemical smell.  They are SO soft and dense.  Only thing I will say: just make sure these are the type of brushes you are looking for, as the face brushes are quite small--they are perfect for contouring, buffing in mineral foundation, etc. but if you are looking for an all-over powder brush, none of these will be what you want.  It really is a wonderful brush set, though.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it.</li>
    <li> i love them ,my items arrived in great condition , they are very soft and blend all my products ( powder.liquids,creams,etc...) very well .Is a  good deal !</li>
    <li> Sooo happy I bought these! They are fantastic and I am in love! The brushes are great and they don&#x27;t shed! Super soft and easy to clean! I went back to try to purchase another set but couldn&#x27;t find any more available! If they are ever back in stock I will repurchase and really encourage you guys to go for it. I mean the price is fantastic! Ulta, Sephora or Sigma can&#x27;t beat these prices!</li>
    <li> Soft, durable bridhes. Shipping was crazy fast!</li>
    <li> I am new at applying make up and wanted t get me some nice starter brushes. These are very soft to the touch and &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; they aren&#x27;t skinny like some of the other brushes I tried. If you want to learn how to apply make up or just want some good brushes that are not very expensive then you should give them a try.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so much!</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are great!  I use the kabuki brush to add powder to my face, then spray it with rosewater, wait until it dries and add another layer if I want or blush.  It gives me a very natural coverage and like I said I can add more layers if I want just have to wait for the rosewater to dry- about a min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the white tips to see what colors I&#x27;ve been using on that brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes are everything. I&#x27;m not a heavy makeup wearer, but these brushes are soft and makes the makeup easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I really was excited about these brushes and then when I washed them once. The brushes started to come apart. Really disappointed! ! I&#x27;ll stick to my real techniques and my mac brushes.</li>
    <li> 2 of my brushes were not up to par. The pointy tip brush shed like crazy. So much hairs came off.the angled flat top&#x27;s handle is bumpy and crooked. Other than that, the other brushes are great</li>
    <li> They are very soft! I love it.</li>
    <li> Some shedding and the handle came off two of them and I glued them back on. Good for blending.</li>
    <li> Very soft and well made.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. Better than I expected.</li>
    <li> It just came today and I can&#x27;t believe how soft it is. Can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> This is my first time ordering brushes off of Amazon. I was impressed by the quality of them and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Color is not gold!! It is a brassy color!!! Soft but smells!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful! They don&#x27;t shed and have held up very well! I would buy again</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the brushes. I would compare them to sigma, that&#x27;s how great they are! The fluffy blending brush is a boop for the sigma e40 I am blown away and love them so much. So soft and dense also. Make up applies so smoothly!</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes for the price. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived in a zip lock bag and upon opening it, it had a strong horrible odor, comparable to paint thinner. When I attempted to rinse them in water, two of the brushes came completely apart. Needless to say, I returned them. The return process was very easy, so I was pleased with that.</li>
    <li> very nice brushes, I am pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I ordered the brushes for christmas gifts and they shed a lot.</li>
    <li> Great, i haven&#x27;t  use them yet but it feel great ill keep out posted</li>
    <li> i love my brushes they  blend so well. they are very good for contouring and  their soft.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price! They looked and felt like professional brushes that are much more expensive</li>
    <li> Got them today... horrible smell in package. the brushed smelled like paint (spray paint). I would never buy these again. I threw them away immediately, worried that it would cause a health problem. i have no idea how this product got good reviews. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Brushes I got don&#x27;t look like the picture.  They all look the same except one is shaped like a little different. Feels like I got 10 blush brushes.  My 8 year old will end up with them. I hate them. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT... are good quality soft but strong at the same time.came 2 days after I place the order</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been watching a multitude of professional make up artists on YouTube.com and decided I needed new brushes. There are so many in this package. I use my favorites everyday. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes,  the only bad thing is the smell . Its a strong paint smell , but besides that i love them.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a bit more variety when I ordered this set. The brushes are okay, but if I had done more research I would have ordered a different set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They arrived on time, they are of good quality, super soft, durable, and cutee! I wish they would have come with a makeup bag but no worries I got a really good deal on these brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Especially if you&#x27;re just starting out in makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Great price as well.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for a friend and she loved them!!!</li>
    <li> the best brushes for the price. perfect for contouring highlighting blush bronzer and foundation application. awesome buy</li>
    <li> I heard so many good things about these brushes. I am glad I bought them, they exceeded expectations!</li>
    <li> Fantastic brushes, made very well. Glad I chose these.</li>
    <li> Within 1 week of use 3 of the brush handles detached... :( you have to be kidding me ....very unsatisfied I have to tape them now so ghetto</li>
    <li> Fabulous brushes. Soft, yet firm. Sturdy handle and bristles are tightly assembled.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING! I love them have become part of my daily makeup routine!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Not only were they very inexpensive but they arrived quickly. The different  shapes really are useful for different party of your face and different uses. The brushes are soft and have not scratched or irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> After my second use...2 of them has broken...the brush part has broken from the handle...I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product...after reading previous reviews that why I purchased...poorly made</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft and quite dense, but they don&#x27;t seem to give phenomenal color payoff, particularly for powders like blush and eyeshadow. I do like the large flat-top brush for blending cream contours in a hurry, but I feel like a good amount of product is taken off my face and absorbed by the brush. The eyeshadow brushes are a bit big for practical application other than all-over lid coverage. Also, there is definitely a chemical smell, but it seems to go away with time and washing. Nothing too unbearable, at least on my brushes. All that said, for the price they&#x27;re a pretty good deal, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find use for most of them at some point or another. Ultimately happier with my MAC, Ecotools, Chanel, and Sephora brushes, but those were moderately to much pricier. These do, however, rank much better than my e.l.f. brushes (about on par, if not cheaper, price-wise).</li>
    <li> LOVE THE BRUSHES!! SO SOFT, LITTLE SHEDDING, AND GREAT SIZE. WILL BE ORDERING MORE AS GIFTS. I&#x27;VE SEEN SOME OF THE OTHER SETS ON AMAZON AND NO WHERE AS GOOD AS THESE ONES. YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG ON ORDERING THESE :)</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, not as dense as I would have like and had that weird factory smell but still love them!</li>
    <li> These are great so far. Haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding</li>
    <li> Seems like a goos product, and good service</li>
    <li> Loved these brushes! Besides 2 or 3 bushes that was sticking out which i didnt mind. Thinking about ordering another set for backup!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful when I ordered these, having spent mountains on name brand brushes that simply didn&#x27;t feel like they were worth the hype or the price tag. The set includes five face brushes (flat top, angled flat top, dome, buffer, and angled buffer) and five eye or detail brushes (again flat top, angled flat top, dome, buffer, and angled buffer). The brushes are sturdy and well constructed with soft, dense bristles. I would definitely recommend these to pros and newbies alike, because you can never have too many blending brushes!</li>
    <li> I have not personally used the more expensive brushes, but these are really great, especially for the money. I had someone ask me if I had a makeover after applying my make up with these (not that I didn&#x27;t look good before they said). creates a beautiful finish. The only thing that could have improved them would be if they had written on the brushes what each is supposed to be for. and  included a video.  Check out youtube though...lots of videos on how to use this type of brush.  I have not had them long, but having washed a couple, I do believe they will hold up.  Very attractive as well.  no problem leaving them out on my vanity.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!! I was scared to buy them because the last set of brushes I bought off Amazon were terrible, but these brushes are LIFE!!! They have been applying my makeup so smoothly, leaving my face so flawless. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Now I know what the BS stands for in BS-MALL... bulls***!!!!&lt;br /&gt;All fell apart and shed all over the place. I&#x27;ve thrown them all away... total PIECE OF CRAP RUBBISH JUNK  Save your money!! DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. They&#x27;re soft, but apply well. They don&#x27;t absorb product like crazy, but just enough. Take good care of them, and they&#x27;ll last you a while.</li>
    <li> These Bushes are fantastic they are really soft and easy to work with!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my brushes.  A must for those looking for great quality brushes without spending an arm &amp; a leg.</li>
    <li> These are good makeup  brushes. The bristles are soft and they are easy too use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes.  They are really solid, do not shed and do a great job of applying loose or pressed powder to my face.  I can get all the uneven areas of my face smoothed out so easily with these.  The blush and eyes brushes are quite good too.  This is a really great collection, excellent value for money.  Now I have more brushes than I could ever need, and they look great - as good as MAC brushes!</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes! The flat top kabukis are great for buffing on foundation. They did shed a little when I got them, but after washing them they seem to be fine. The handles feel a bit cheap but they have held up fie through multiple washes.</li>
    <li> These brushes and price for the quality work it does are awesome. These rival those expensive ones found at sephora. The face brushes blends foundation in flawlessly and the eye brushes blends shadows seamlessly. I will be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product hasnt shed</li>
    <li> The product arrival quickly, well worth its price. Brushes are easily cleaned, too.</li>
    <li> Best investment i ever made . After you wash them . Air dry face down . Smell will go away In time . Love love love these brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft, but they are also densely packed, making them a great dupe for more pricey brushes out there. I&#x27;ve used them since they arrived, and I not had any problems with shedding or soaking up too much of my liquid products. These brushes were a great buy, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes!  Great quality-can&#x27;t go wrong!  You get a lot of different brushes for just about any application. The bristles don&#x27;t gunk up or fall out like the cheap drugstore ones will do.</li>
    <li> Really great, you will not be disappointed with these brushes. All the reviews are correct in saying there dense and thick. Brushes work like a charm and make your face look flawless!</li>
    <li> These&amp;#34;Premium Synthetic Kabuki Makeup Brush Set Cosmetics Foundation Blending are nice but there is a weird but strange smell to them.  I cannot figure it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on here before but I am very pleased with this purchase, so I wanted to show them some love. I initially thought that for the price and amount of brushed I was buying, that I would probably be getting something along the lines of drugstore brushes. I usually by either mac or sigma brushes so I was amazed at the quality And softness of these brushes when I received them. very sturdy and super soft. You cannot beat the price, seriously!! I want to buy some for all my friends who complain about not being able to buy good brushes cause they&#x27;re too expensive! Not anymore :D</li>
    <li> The brushes to smell pretty intense once out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to wash thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Brushes are super soft! Works great on contouring and foundation blending! Glad I purchase it!</li>
    <li> Upon delivery the brushes smelled strongly of how I would describe a fresh,close spray paint odor. Within 2 days, 4 out of the 10 brushes have become &amp;#34;unglued&amp;#34;, not broken as in snapped, but they are unattached where the gold trim meets the black handle. I love the brushes MINUS this defect. Hoping that I maybe just got a bad batch. Awaiting response from the seller...</li>
    <li> the brushes do have a hard core funky artificial smell... but they work great. I say wash them before using them, then have super glued ready bc one of my brushed detached.  but I kind of assumed that would happen sooner or later.  these are not designer brushes, but as far as the bristles are concerned, those are great. very smooth and full.</li>
    <li> when I opened this product I found a weird smell to it which I think is the gold part of the brush. also when I was openining it I found one of my brushes melted with the gold part ? I don&#x27;t know exactly how that happened but I wasn&#x27;t too happy about that. overall the brush works good compared to expensive ones. I would just hope they would package there products better.</li>
    <li> Trying to figure it out.  I&#x27;m going back to makeup after my surgery.  So I really haven&#x27;t had a chance to really try it out.</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice HOWEVER when the black piece comes off after using it the 3rd time.... not so nice I bought from BS-MALL. Another thing is they came in smelling funky. A lot of these comments would have changed if they allowed 1 month after use.</li>
    <li> They all looked alike and very confusing to me.</li>
    <li> These are really great brushes, comparable to expensive brushes. They do have chemical smell. I washed them before using in a lavender dish soap, now they smell great. So washing them will take that smell out. Definitely worth getting, little price for quality. 😊The flat tip brush is excellent with putting on foundation.</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  I have another set from Shanti (i think) and it&#x27;s bad.  I then bought a set of sephora brushes for twice the amount and they arent&#x27; even as soft  Buy it.  It&#x27;s a really good investment.</li>
    <li> These are very soft and have used them several times now. They are holding up nicely! They blend beautifully!</li>
    <li> Makeup goes on so smooth and easy thank you so much</li>
    <li> BEGAN TO FALL APART AFTER FIRST USE .. THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED :(</li>
    <li> Brushes are ok, one of the the top popped off just pulling it from the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Urban Decay eyeshadow was broken when I opened it, one of the colors was shattered and everywhere. Kind of a bummer. It was only bubble wrapped on one side. Two sided wrap probably would have prevented this, especially when shipping g eye shadows.</li>
    <li> They come apart, but once you glue them back to the handle, they&#x27;re good...</li>
    <li> Amazing! Best buy for makeup brushes ever! Great quality, great buy. All the brushes came with plastic protecting them. They did have a strong chemical smell but nothing a brush cleaner can&#x27;t fix. None of the handles nor bristles are loose. Amazing buy</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! So soft! I have high end brushes and I actually use these more than I use the high end ones. There is no shedding, they wash up nice and they apply makeup just as good as the high end brushes! If you are looking for inexpensive, high quality brushes, this is the set for you! Simply amazing!</li>
    <li> Very good product and conforms to specifications and seller fast handling and confident and very suitable prices</li>
    <li> Wow! Amazed with the quality of these brushes! Will def buy a bunch more.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they hold up better than some my expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> The flat one isn&#x27;t as big as the pic makes it look but its a good set</li>
    <li> Excellent quality brushes.</li>
    <li> In love with this purchase! less than 7 days, in perfect condition! I back to order again for my sister.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered these, definitely was mentally keeping myself in check as to have low-med expectations - maybe they&#x27;ll be my travel/gym brushes. BUT EUREKA. They inspired me to write my first review ever of anything. These brushes are just as good if not better and denser than brushes I&#x27;ve bought from Sephora - and all of them! ALL OF THEM were cheaper than one Sephora brush. Unreal.  I know some people said they noticed a smell, I didn&#x27;t have this issue at all and I&#x27;m highly sensitive to scent.  I&#x27;ve also read that some people say they fall apart - I admit they are not the sturdiest, but I think if you&#x27;re applying normal pressure and not transporting them too much - you&#x27;ll be more than fine.  And if you&#x27;re not, ain&#x27;t nothin a quick hot glue can&#x27;t fix.  Can&#x27;t stress enough how dense and soft and a total steal these are! Get &#x27;EM.</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and really high quality. Got here quick and right on time.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush set, blends my Make up perfectly and the handle is well made looks expensive.</li>
    <li> Loved these brushes. They hardly shed, and came very quickly in the mail. Most of my brushes before these were cheap and would break off at the neck, but I doubt I&#x27;ll have that problem with this sturdy, easy to grip, brushes.</li>
    <li> The bristles are really lose (not dense), bad for blending in foundation. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter as a birthday gift. She adores them. I am seriously thinking of getting a set for me. Great Product.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They&#x27;re super soft and great quality for such a fair price :)</li>
    <li> I purchased these to add to my brush collection. I couldn&#x27;t resist the price and the reviews seemed to praise this set - I have multiple sets of brushes that were a lot more expensive than these, and these happen to be my favorite. They are very soft and clean easily, I was initially worried they&#x27;d fall apart from cleaning but they have held up and I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now. If you own Sigma brushes, I would stick with those but this brush set is a perfect alternative.</li>
    <li> Really soft but some of my brushes broke within a couple minutes of using them :(</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are inexpensive Sigma dupes (except for the brushes don&#x27;t have the brand name label on it). They are soft, easy to wash, sturdy and they don&#x27;t shed. Comes in a set of 10 brushes- I love the 5 face brushes more than the 5 eye brushes that it comes with. When you open the plastic packaging- it smells like oil paint, which was a very strong smell and almost gave me a headache. But after I washed them and air dried and the smell was gone. Great buy!! You will not regret buying these :)</li>
    <li> I love this brushes. I think instead of spending a lot of brand brushes, these are way better for the price. The quality of these brushes are above and beyond. I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Wish they came in a box or carrying case but the brushes are very beautiful and are very soft..had a slight smell to them but goes away after a wash</li>
    <li> They have A very strong paint smell, and the wooden handles break off. I did not like this product. If youre looking for a nice set of brushes, i would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice set, very soft and gentle.</li>
    <li> These brushes are such good quality for the low price! They are all so soft, yet firm. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> So love these brushes they get the job done for the right price !</li>
    <li> Perfect brushes. Sturdy and soft. Bristles aren&#x27;t falling out or poking out the side or anything. Foundation brush evenly applies. (I was worried about that) as much bang for your buck you will get! Buy these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality with great value. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great quality but all the brushes are so similar to one another</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! I&#x27;ve been a mua for 4 years, and for the price, these brushes really do the job! I highly recommend them. The reason why they don&#x27;t get a full 5 star from me, is the smell. I washed them upon arrival and the smell of chemicals is still on a few of them. Nothing you can&#x27;t handle! Just a side note.</li>
    <li> the brushes are really good It would help if it came with a guide on the name  of the brushes</li>
    <li> Veey soft. I really like how my foundation goes on with it. I havent had any problems with it!</li>
    <li> The bristles on these brushes are very soft, apply, and blend product well.  However two of the brushes I received fell apart at the ferrules.  I deiced to wash the brushes before fixing them.  I did notice that the brushes shed just a little bit and some of the bristles were uneven.  I fixed the brushes with hot glue and trimmed the long bristles after they dried.  Now that the brushes are fixed I am enjoying them very much.  I have used them every time I apply makeup.  Overall for the price these brushes are a good buy; if you do not mind taking the time to add hot glue to the bristles inside of the ferrule and applying some glue along the inside top portion of the ferrule. (I got this idea from one of the other reviews I read about this product).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes.  Many of the reviews mentioned the smell of the brushes however , it lasts for a few hours. Trust me it&#x27;s worth the purchase and price!</li>
    <li> Omg I absolutely loooove these brushes! I don&#x27;t own any of the Sedona Lace or Sigma brushes, but I do have MAC brushes and these are wayyy softer...Truly a must buy for the price</li>
    <li> There was alot for the price its a steal . As ive seen only 3 of them go for like 15 bucks at stores when i take my GF . But i know those are brand name but still . She was happy</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price, but mostly all of the handles were broken but it was easily fixed with some super glue!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Very easy to hold and they work well with liquid and powdered makeup. My brushes didn&#x27;t have a smell that some other users were stating the brushes had. Great price and I received the brushes promptly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely AMAZING. These are a STEAL for the price compared to the quality. These brushes are very dense, extremely soft (great for people with sensitive skin), and these are for sure a dupe for Sigma. I have a 10 piece Sigma set and these are way better. The shedding is light to none at all. These brushes are incredible for the price and just for being makeup brushes in general. I will use these over my Sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> Good quality for price.</li>
    <li> I love them! Soft brushes and they glide well! I wanted some Sigma brushes but I am thankful I bought these. I recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They&#x27;re super soft and apply makeup well. A few brushes needed bristles trimmed and two of them are loose from the handle, but nothing major. I really like them for the price.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  Brushes are very soft and as pictured.  I can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
    <li> Not a big make-up informant but these brushes are okay. Not much variety in brush sizes though, and barely a difference in head shape. An angled smaller brush would have been appreciated.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast &amp; the brushes are very soft and work great !</li>
    <li> Brushes are amazing for the price I paid! I like em!</li>
    <li> Terrible brushes, period.  Save your money for a real brush.  I would rather buy one awesome brush then have a bunch of junky ones.  They smell terrible like a chemical plastic.  The one brush I attempted to use despite the extremely soft bristles broke.  Literally the gold top came right off the wooden black handle.  Save your money..</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!  I can&#x27;t believe it comes with so many brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> Great brushes . I love them ! I highly recommend because there affordable and great !</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes but they smell of chemicals so air them out before using.</li>
    <li> Love the flat end brush! Brushes are very soft! So many options to choose for the various make up applications - blush, concealer, .. Multi use!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. nice and soft . great for a beginner makeup collection. I love them so far. Great price!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. For the price they cannot be beat. I use them every day. They work wonderfully with my bare minerals foundation. None have shed or fallen apart so far and I&#x27;ve been using them about a month</li>
    <li> These a the BOMB! Haven&#x27;t lost not one hair. The perfect set for the Professional MUA.</li>
    <li> These are just junk. After washing once the glue came undone and they are nearly falling apart. Just settle for fewer brushes of higher quality. save your time and money. K.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a dupe for the bh cosmetics sculpt and blend set... they are wonderful! For the price i couldnt believe how soft they are.  I get the most use out of the flat top and angled kabuki.  I use the flat top to effortlessly blend liquid foundation and the angled kabuki for powder contouring</li>
    <li> Very soft, and applies make up well. Wash before use.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very nice. The quality is great, especially considering the price.</li>
    <li> Great brushes and great deal! They are very soft and nice quality. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> some of the bristles feel more synthetic than others</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this brush set</li>
    <li> Love the. Great quality. Helped makeup appear even more flawless. You might need to re-glue the brush to the handle because two of mine slipped off of the handle when I cleaned them. Other than that, they are amazing brushes for under ten dollars.</li>
    <li> Amazing set of brushes, prompt customer service!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing for the price! The larger brushes are great at applying foundation, concealer, and powder in larger areas of the face. The smaller brushes, however, are a little too big to fit my eyes. The small fluffier brushes are great for blending eyeshadow and the denser ones are great for sweeping color across the lid. If you want a more precisely done eye look, these brushes won&#x27;t work as well for that purpose. All of these brushes are super soft, comparable to my Sephora and Real Techniques brushes :) These shipped at a good speed too, around 4 days. The only complaint I have is the strong, chemical smell after opening the packaging; it does go away significantly after you wash them, but the plastic smell still lingers a little. It&#x27;s overall a great buy! I will probably be buying another set for my kit.</li>
    <li> One of my brushes like unstuck to the gold part 😑 and i only used it once..</li>
    <li> Brushes broke right away</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. They do the job, the end of the brush ends up coming off but you can easily glue it back.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t so bad they get the job done.</li>
    <li> These are good brushes - came a day late, but Amazon took care of that by refunding my money.  This is a good product and exactly what I was looking for...</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the pack of brushes, the brush head came unattached from the handle on EVERY SINGLE BRUSH. I&#x27;m so dissapppinted, it&#x27;s like they weren&#x27;t even glued together. Definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes get an A+. Don&#x27;t go to sephora to buy expensive brushes before you&#x27;ve given these a try !</li>
    <li> I love them they are so soft and cute</li>
    <li> Great shipping! Came two weeks earlier than expected. They have a smell but wash them off and they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Nice soft brushes. Had to re-glue the handles as was advised by others. After that they worked wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Great smell great feel... great product</li>
    <li> Just got them today..and I must say that I LOVE them. The brushes were neatly packed, they were individually wrapped, and there was a thank you note inside offering replacement or discount if defected.  But I have made no use of it because they are in perfect condition.  And the price is good, I would say you get more than what you paid for.  Ofcourse I got these to begin with..Im starting to get into makeup and contouring and all...so I say I made a good choice in buying these brushes.</li>
    <li> The very strong chemical smell these put off triggered an asthma attack. If you have asthma, allergies or any kind of sensitivity to smell I would not recommend purchasing these brushes.  Also, they arrived loose in a plastic slip cover and many of them are the same shape. It almost looks as if someone bought a bunch of the same brushes and tried to trim them to look different. I will be returning these.</li>
    <li> these brushes dont even pick up makeup right. Horrible quality. i would not recommend for anyone to but this.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Super cheap compared to any other place and they&#x27;re so soft! definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, they were inexpensive and they&#x27;re great. The brushes arrived fast, they&#x27;re soft, and they were packaged nicely. I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 months already and I just love them. They&#x27;re a great bargain, you won&#x27;t regret buying them.</li>
    <li> GOOD BRUHES FOR THE PRICE.  THE SMELL IS HORRIBLE BUT JUST WASH THEM AND ITS ALL GOOD</li>
    <li> I personally think that this is a perfect dupe for sephora brushes, doesn&#x27;t shed any hair either like other Inexpensive brushes.&amp;  The price is a plus! I would recommend these to everyone!😊</li>
    <li> Good stuff for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful. They feel so soft and lush against the skin. This is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I love how soft these are.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very soft and work well. They do however have a VERY strong paint smell. They come in a plastic wrapping. I am hoping after unwrapping and letting them air out that the smell will subside. Other than that, they work really great!</li>
    <li> So AMAZING lol I guess you get that I have nothing negative to say, the best brushes I&#x27;ve used to date!!! And I&#x27;ve used both Mac and a mixture of drugstore brands this is the best I&#x27;ll by more just to stock up on them!</li>
    <li> Arrived when expected, good brushes, exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> They are amazing so soft.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. Look exactly like the picture. Great for contouring and highlighting. And they are awesome for applying liquid and mousse foundations. They are very dense brushes so when you apply your makeup it will look flawless. A few hairs come out but that&#x27;s okay for such a great quality brush and such a low price. If the metal part of the brush feels loose or comes off just super glue or hot glue it back on and good as new. This was an awesome buy for the price and I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like the brushes, they hold powder well and are easily cleaned</li>
    <li> I never do reviews but these brushes are awesome. Very soft. Best of all no animals harmed.😊</li>
    <li> Nice soft brushes but the base isnt glued well.</li>
    <li> These are soft as can be. No frays. Easy to clean. Great product.</li>
    <li> LOVE MAKEUP BRUSH SET. TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
    <li> Recently I had to through away all of my eye makeup and brushes due to pinkeye. Needless to say I had to replace them, but at a low cost. I recieved them in the mail today and I was impressed. They did have a chemical smell, but it was faint not overpowering. I washed and rinsed them thoroughly and the smell is gone. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes except they smelled really bad.  For the price, they are awesome though.</li>
    <li> Worried they weren&#x27;t going to be as great as the reviews said they were, but I absolutely love them! I washed them right away and they still hold their shape and work really well!</li>
    <li> very nice brushes for the price you cant beat this deal. They did smell like plastic i washed them and let them air dray and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;****update- 2 weeks into using them 4 brushes handles fell off</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok. Some are really dense, some aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They work great! And they&#x27;re not an arm and a leg like most brushes!</li>
    <li> Super soft has a weird smell washed them before use</li>
    <li> I love This brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. They are soft and feel so nice on my face! They blend make up good and I love the gold on the brush. They do smell a little when you take them out of the package, but with a wash and aired out a bit that should go away. After all, they are brand new.</li>
    <li> Received on time and as expected - great!</li>
    <li> For the price the brushes are great. The are soft and pick up a good amount of make up. Only complain I have is that I&#x27;ve had them for about one month and two already are getting loose.  The brush part wiggles around when I&#x27;m putting make up on.  Wish they varied more in size, but for the price Go for it!</li>
    <li> Very soft, sturdy. Love them</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and quality of the brushes!  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Not worth the investment...even though it was an add-on. After a few washes the bristles separated from the brush.</li>
    <li> Very soft bushes &amp; fast shipping, but the smell of the brushes aren&#x27;t all that appealing......</li>
    <li> I wanted writing a review until after I washed the brushes because of previous reviews. Some said brushes fell apart and what not. I have washed my brushes and they are still good. Honestly you cannot beat the price. Makeup brushes can be so expensive. I loved the price and had to try them. My makeup applied well and the brushes are still in good shape. Did have a chemical smell but after the first time I used it it went away. Arrived on time and packaged. Product arrived as describe. Like I said cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> I opened the package and two brushes fell apart, wasn&#x27;t shipping back, shipping cost more then the product. Also, all brushes are very stiff, horrible feeling on my face, so i threw them away. No good!</li>
    <li> These are so great. I love them!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes several months ago and they are still in great condition. Still super soft and dense, and I remember when I got them that they had a mild plastic smell but it was no problem to get rid of. They arrived super quickly and if I ever need to replace them, I&#x27;d buy these again! I use them every day and they&#x27;re still great :^)</li>
    <li> These are absolutely the best make up brushes that I have ever used, and I have used a lot of them! These brushes allow me to quickly and easily apply my eye make up to my eyes. If you want great looking eyes, use these brushes and also try this amazing eye gel [[ASIN:B00VSBDR78 Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and Matrixyl 3000 Super Peptide Complex]] – reduces the lines and wrinkles around my eyes and makes me look younger and more vibrant! Use these products for great looking eyes!</li>
    <li> I like these brushes however there are no names on them. Wish it was listed but I work with it</li>
    <li> Overall good product, my only concern is that the brushes are not marked for their function/purpose (I am not an expert in makeup application). Other than that, they function as expected.</li>
    <li> NEW POST:&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I posted a comment on how much I loved these brushes, however, things have definitely changed. The first set of brushes that I received several months back were wonderful. They had an incredible handle and the bristles were spectacular. I decided to order a new set of brushes because I loved them so much and I have to say that I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed. The new set of brushes have a substantially smaller handle, the metal is thin and so are the bristles. I don&#x27;t  know if BS-MALL decided to change manufacturing in order to cut costs, but it didn&#x27;t work in their favor. I hardly use my new brushes and I have to say that I wish they would&#x27;ve stated that they changed the way they are made. Many of you are probably thinking that I should expect this from brushes that are less than $20 dollars. However, if any of you tried the brushes before the change many of you could agree that the quality definitely went down. I would&#x27;ve easily compared these brushes to the Sigma line or MAC, but now I would honestly compare the larger facial brushes to something that you received with a L&#x27;oreal compact powder. The reason I gave it three stars is because I do like the eye brushes. They bristles are perfect for blending, and that&#x27;s about it. Many of the brushes don&#x27;t hold in the product very well, however, they blend colors beautifully. I really hope that this company decides to go back to their old methods because these brushes we&#x27;re the only ones I would ever buy. Now, I just want to ask for my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD POST:&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying that when it comes to makeup I&#x27;ve owned almost every brush that there is to own. Each set is different from the last, however, you know the good ones because their still in your cabinet. These brushes are spectacular. I wear makeup every single day and I can be fairly hard on my brushes. I have a tendency to forget to clean them and most of them travel with me wherever I go. I must say, I&#x27;ve only used these brushes for powdered products. The bristles are tightly fitted together and the feel of these brushes are soft and perfect for applying any type of makeup. My two personal favorite brushes are the angled contour brush and the brush that resembles a cone and I must say that they are dreamy to use. The eye brushes work just as well. This is one of those products that I would highly suggest stocking up on because having these amazing brushes for this price isn&#x27;t going to last long. These are the must have brushes for anyone to have, wether you are just starting off with makeup or you&#x27;ve been doing it your whole life. These brushes will not let you down.or powdered products. The bristles are tightly fitted together and the feel of these brushes are soft and perfect for applying any type of makeup.

    <li> These are decent brushes considering how much they cost. Yes, they&#x27;re very stinky and chemical-y smelling, but they&#x27;re alright once you air them out a little. My only issue is the brushes seem to be shedding day one of using them which is annoying. But other then that, they get the job done!</li>
    <li> love them have recommended to several people</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, gives me an airbrush finish look.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes but just wish they were label as to which brush was what.</li>
    <li> Soft brushes, beautiful set and very well priced. It was delivered even before the estimate date.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Brushes are very soft, but wood handles fall off easily. Arrives with a strong chemical scent that goes away after wash.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes were delivered quickly. The seller was very nice and refunded $ for a defective brush.</li>
    <li> Starting to fall apart after minimal use.</li>
    <li> Love the big brushes for foundation. They are very soft!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried because they did not cost a lot but I love them.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very sturdy and not flemsy. I love them. It&#x27;s just like a brush that you could buy from Mac.</li>
    <li> Only been able to try the foundation and blush brush so far. But i love both! They apply my makeup very nicely. The only thing i&#x27;m not liking about it...it has this really strong smell. When I open my makeup case, this almost &amp;#34;gas-like&amp;#34; smell flows out of my makeup case &amp; gives me a headache. Maybe i got to air their out more?</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast...but the 1st time I used one of the brushes...it shed a bit...there okay...not the best...you get what you pay for. There still holding up but Im looking to purchase some better quality brushes this time around. ..</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the the foundation and blush brushes. Very soft, yet the density is great. The eyeshadow blending brushes are not thick enough</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I bought them for my sisters for Christmas and they loved it so much I had to get a set for myself and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really great for the price. They are comparable to &amp;#34;name brand brushes&amp;#34;. They leave my make up flawless. No need to pay 30-40 bucks per brush when u can get these. The only cons I have noticed are the brushes are kind of loose at the metal part. But I just took them a part and glued them back with a hot glue gun. Another con is that there is minimal shedding. But for the price I dnt mind picking one or two off my face.</li>
    <li> Happy wife Happy life</li>
    <li> I love this product, bristles are quite soft and are remains durable when washed.</li>
    <li> Loooooveeee them, they&#x27;re just so damn softtttt. I may do a tutorial on my youtube channel</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few months now and it&#x27;s still very soft and doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
    <li> they all look the same</li>
    <li> The brushes are useable I guess they aren&#x27;t good quality and they fell apart before I even used them waste of money do not buy I used them because I had no other choice my other brushes had just been washed</li>
    <li> Loved these brushes First time putting on liquid foundation with brushes and I was amazed.  My cousin had bought them and she had recommended them to me.  There worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> For the first few months I&#x27;ve owned these, they&#x27;ve been great: until the gold part started detaching from the handle. They&#x27;re very soft and I love the way the apply makeup.</li>
    <li> Love these great brushes</li>
    <li> Love the variety and texture of the brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great value. They&#x27;re soft and provide even coverage. The only &amp;#34;down side&amp;#34; if you consider it one, is that the foundation brushes are not as dense as other ones I&#x27;ve owned, so it won&#x27;t be as full coverage.</li>
    <li> Good product but beware that all these are angles brushes and not for general application.</li>
    <li> these brushes are sooooo soft &amp; they shipped the next day! the handles are 100% sturdy &amp; are an exact duplicate of the sigma brushes!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Excellent quality for the price.  Definitely great brushes for applying foundation, cover up/concealer and countering.  Not the best for eye shadow though.</li>
    <li> They were great. There was a glue smell but I washed them &amp; kept it moving. That doesn&#x27;t affect anything important. I just wish there was a flat-sided heavy coverage foundation brush as opposed to the flat-top foundation brush included but ELF had one on sale for $1 so I&#x27;m still happy. And it came in a plastic pouch inside individual wrapping so they listen to customers who ask for it. I would like to see them labeled by uses tho.</li>
    <li> Loving using these brushes. Works wonderfully when contouring.</li>
    <li> Really great! The shipment was on time. The leaflet with the product says it will smell plasticky but I followed the instruction kn how to wash it and it smelt better when it got dry. I love it and it makes putting makeup on so easy and quick. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only $9.99 only for a good makeup brush quality. I&#x27;m a happy customer :)</li>
    <li> Really nice shape still waiting for the rest of my order.</li>
    <li> I completely loveeeee these makeup brushes!!!! They are the best!!! I want them all!!! best quality ever!!</li>
    <li> Regret purchasing this product. Not good quality at all.</li>
    <li> One of my brushes broke lame</li>
    <li> love them but that hash smell when you first get them is horrible! ugh! wash them about seven darn times just to get the smell out.</li>
    <li> These brushes are phenomenal. I can&#x27;t imagine a single bad review unless someone received a defective set. The edged concealer brush alone is worth $15 and I got the whole set for $9. If the handles detach, super glue them and you&#x27;ll never have another issue. My set were all firmly attached and I haven&#x27;t had a problem in the few weeks I&#x27;ve used them. The bristles are tightly packed and yet still soft. Some people are complaining of a chemical smell. Air them out for 24 hours and it goes away completely. This was SUCH a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/3/16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these a full year now and they are still incredible. I wash them once a week and they are all exactly as I bought them. Worth so much more than I paid.</li>
    <li> Brushes are super soft and blend well. The only downfall is that it strongly smelled like paint when it first arrived.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really use the brushes yet because I&#x27;ve just got them for about 2 days. But the brushes are very soft. A few brush, you can see one or two hair sticks out. The big kabuki brushes are soft and are in good shape. The smaller brushes lose their shape a little bit from their plastic covers. And like I said, I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet, so I don&#x27;t know how good they are. But the big brushes just look like they&#x27;re better qualities than the small ones somehow, just by the look of it. But they are very beautiful. And I do recommend it to anyone who wants to try and are new at makeup like myself. It&#x27;s not that expensive either, so it won&#x27;t be such a huge mess when they&#x27;re not what you expect.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, but my brush broke in half the first day I used it!</li>
    <li> I bought this set based on the wonderful reviews and while I do use them from time to time I don&#x27;t find myself always reaching for them. The fluffy eye brushes are the only ones I use frequently. The other brushes are packed to tightly and are not easy to work with. The facial brushes are nothing special I could see how maybe someone who doesn&#x27;t have many brushes would think these are wonderful for the price but they just aren&#x27;t that great compared to some of my other brushes. I have many Clinique and Sonia Kashuk brushes and those compared to these are night and day. I wanted to love these but I just don&#x27;t. At least I&#x27;m only out 10 bucks....</li>
    <li> Me encantaron !! las ame &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Already falling apart</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with these, one was broken on arrival, and about half of them are either broken or shedding terribly. Okay for the price though.</li>
    <li> The bristles are so soft and pick up makeup like a charm. I loved these brushes. I would just be careful because one or two might come broken. I didn&#x27;t have this problem but a friend of mine who ordered these same brushes did.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really work for me</li>
    <li> Can not believe how awesome these brushes work for the amount I got them!! Great buy!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good quality</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Another reviewer notes washing them first. I did because there was a slight chemical odor. After a good wash and proper dry, the brushes are my go to for daily make-up application.</li>
    <li> Too strong Chemical smell, soft but can&#x27;t hold and blend liquid product</li>
    <li> They are so soft and very cheap!! Love them!</li>
    <li> Came on time and are great brushes !!!</li>
    <li> Great value. Reaaaaally soft brushed. Although two of them shed a little bit,with the price I can totally look past that</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
    <li> What a surprise!  These are Wonderful quality, soft, no brush hairs have come out at all, and I have had these for a while, and ordered more.  For the price, I got a wonderful bargain, took a chance, saw the price, at a time when most cosmetic brush sets are Pricey in the 50. or more range.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend.!</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these makeup brushes for about 8 months now. I wash them every few weeks with shampoo and haven&#x27;t had any problem with them retaining shape, bristles falling out or sticking together and they still look great! I&#x27;m not a professional by any means, but they serve my daily makeup routine well. Really happy with these brushes!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes. I have been using these for about a month. They are great quality. Very happy I purchased them.</li>
    <li> This product need to be label...for person now in to makeup. Wouldn&#x27;t know the differences with the brush because they so similar</li>
    <li> Best BRUSHES EVER!!! The quality is Amazing! Definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> everything came.and was in great condition</li>
    <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for myself and as gifts for my mom and sister in law needles to say the quality of the brushes was great. Luxurious brushes without the outrageous price tag highly recommend and will be buying more as gifts for the holiday season !</li>
    <li> works great! best and cheapest brush set ever</li>
    <li> Great xmas gift !&lt;br /&gt;Super soft !&lt;br /&gt;And great condition</li>
    <li> Worst brushes ever. They were all broken when I received them. The eyeshadow brushes are very awkward and don&#x27;t work as an eyeshadow brush at all.</li>
    <li> Cheap and the quality good</li>
    <li> Great sturdy brushes! Perfect quality! My makeup goes on SO much better with these then my eco tool brushes I got at walmart. I also notice my foundation looks better if I use the brush instead of my hands. Great product would buy again!</li>
    <li> So soft, great quality! Wish I would have purchased them sooner!</li>
    <li> Love it! Totally worth it</li>
    <li> These are great brushes! I love the way they glide any make-up onto your face - without leaving a streaky look. I got my brushes very quickly and am impressed with the product!</li>
    <li> Awesome blending brushes.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes! They&#x27;re very soft and feel very expensive even though they&#x27;re extremely affordable. I really liked them :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful set.  They are not as dense as sigma brushes but they work very well with my foundation, concealer, cream eye shadows and more.  Great set to try.  They are very soft and perfect size handles.  I recommend these for those who don&#x27;t find a need to spend so much money on great quality brushes that get the job done and they look pretty.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really know much about make up, but I believe this might&#x27;ve been worth the money</li>
    <li> I got my brushes today! I love them. They&#x27;re beautiful and they are they seem of very high quality! I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them as of yet, but I can already tell, they won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
    <li> The brushes look nice. They come in a thin plastic bag without any labels. They have a strooong chemical smell. I checked the other negative reviews, and sure enough, the odor was referenced.</li>
    <li> Perfect for blending! Very full brushes, minimal shed!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly what I wanted for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Good quality synthetic brushes,the flaw is the strange chemical smell. Hopefully that goes away with a few uses.</li>
    <li> Best brushes to invest in. They are thick and dense. Perfect for blending and contouring. I would recommend these brushes to any make up junkie.</li>
    <li> Ok so I just recived my brushes.  I&#x27;m no mua. I just wanted a few good brushes to apply my foundation. ..any who the quality of the brushes seems amazing. I haven&#x27;t used them, but the feel is amazing. One thing I was bummed about was not knowing what brush is for what (applying wise). But I will play around and see for myself. So prompt shipping and great quality. I can&#x27;t complain. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality considering the price. They have a smell when they arrive but all you have to do is give them a wash. They blend foundation, concealer, and shadows beautifully</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought these! They&#x27;re somewhere between MAC and sephora brand brushes quality-wise. Very soft and not much fall out on the eyeshadow brushes. They are a bit big, but I love the pointed shadow brush and the other are good for contouring the nose and blending the eyes, etc. Great find!</li>
    <li> Super soft nd definitely worth the money!!!! Did have a weird smell, as mentioned in previous reviews, but it wasn&#x27;t a gross smell, just more chemical, nothing a little soap can,t handle. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Im really annoyed that I ordered the gold brushes but recieved silver. Very disappointed.  Have not tried the brushes themselves.  Returning for gold! There also was no packing slip in box.</li>
    <li> The brushes are super soft and for the price, they are well worth it. However, they do have a STRONG paint/Sharpie smell that has yet to go away after multiple washes. In terms of quality, again they are good for the price. The brushes are not as dense as I prefer my brushes to be but they will do in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes.  Yes, they do hAve a smell, but it goes away with a good brush cleaner.  I was looking for a good set like for applying makeup.  For years I had been applying with the wrong tools.  These do the trick so my make looks completely flawless.  The bristles are super soft and the handles are very sturdy.  I would definitely recommend these for first time make up users who are looking for brushes that will last a long time.  They do take a bit of time to receive in the mail, but that is due to where they are coming from.  My sister in law loves make up and we&#x27;re thinking about getting her a set for her birthday.  I&#x27;ve only used the small ones so far but pretty sure the big ones will apply the same flawless look I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Very high quality brushes. I&#x27;m very impressed. Very soft and hairs stay intact. Overall great purchase</li>
    <li> I heart these brushes.  They are soft and the brushes don&#x27;t shed.  I&#x27;ve purchased other cheap brush sets and they shed everywhere.  These are perfect. Highly recommend!!!  Fast Delivery!!</li>
    <li> These are nice brushes but they have a strong smell to them!</li>
    <li> Love it. Fast delivery and it looks like is professional. The only thing is that I hate it that smell of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Do have a bit of a chemical smell but they are so soft and look exactly like the picture. I love them!</li>
    <li> Great brushes.  I loved it.</li>
    <li> Very good gf loved it</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes with the intention of replacing them with better (more expensive) brushes from Sephora, but these brush are amazing! The wooden handle feels smooth to your touch, the brush feel good on your face and they spread makeup very evenly. These brushes are definitely worth your money... Plus, they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
    <li> very nice soft,quality brushes</li>
    <li> I love it!! To be synthetic it&#x27;s very smooth on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love it. They are so soft.</li>
    <li> Gift for my 15 yr old daughter who loves the brushes....she loves using them and they don&#x27;t fall apart when you wash them....Great for the price</li>
    <li> Some brushes are better than others.  Two of the big brushes dis-attached from the handle, need to glue it together. The bristles are soft and are not shedding.</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed, I thought I was ordering RC Cosmetic brushes turns out no, they&#x27;re basically a no name brand brush, also they had a very strong glue odor I expected a smell from what I read &amp; saw on YouTube, when I washed them 1 of the eyeshadiw brushes the wood part cracked not to bad not even noticeable by just looking, but can definitely feel. As far as the brushes themselves was actually surprised for the price definitely work well. Still most likely going to buy the RC Kabuki set</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes earlier today, and I&#x27;m really excited I brought some brushes from Walmart, and they were ok, but after I washed one it was just awful! So I needed some more, I like ordering things from amazon because I get to read the reviews of all different types of people and it gives me an idea on how good the product is! Thank you amazon reviewers!</li>
    <li> Love the quality of brushes but it does has a strong chemical smell. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I am a total make up snob. The fact that these were such an amazing price i was expecting not great product but wanted to see. I was 100% satisfied when i received them in the mail. They were each wrapped up and protected and secure. And the when using them hair doesn&#x27;t fall out. It feels great on your skin. It easily is one of my new favorite items. I use them daily. I&#x27;m in love with them!!!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful brush set. Soft bristles full. Haven&#x27;t noticed any fallout yet. Washed one of the brushes last night and it help up ok.</li>
    <li> I found these brushed for a great price. I recieved them a little before the day that was supposed to come. They were individually wrapped. The application of makeup very even for this price. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the eyeshadow brushes are too big. Other than that the brushes are soft and I would definitely recommend anyone to purchase these brushes.</li>
    <li> I got these 2 weeks early! They are so nice. Package was amazing. I&#x27;m still blown away lol I&#x27;ll deff will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes, easy to care for &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> Love them! Soft, decent and affordable! Fast shipping! Thanks</li>
    <li> Love it! Very soft and the bristles feel high quality. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I was so excited for these and glad I got them. Also I know it&#x27;s confusing which brush is what because they aren&#x27;t labeled but when is there rules to use which brush for what? Use the brushes how you feel like you should use them and it will serve that purpose;) Never got that bad smell in them either so idk what people are talking about. One last thing, it does come with a little pouch.</li>
    <li> Very soft, no shedding. But they&#x27;re beginning to fall apart where the metal and wood connect. But you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> this brushes are soooo soft!!! im buying another set!!! better quality tan MAC and Sephora brushes! AAA</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! Just what I was looking for and needed</li>
    <li> Love love love! Professional quality! Super soft and they even look high end.  I just wish the set included some smaller eye brushes.</li>
    <li> Besides the horrible smell before you wash them they are soft and work very well you will need to do your own labeling though.</li>
    <li> great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> They have a smell but I fix it washing them. they are soft and great quality. Definitely buy this set.</li>
    <li> GREAT quality for the money you pay for, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to order them at first because the hairs on the brush where the black part is looked very shiny which meant it might be cheap quality which it is ...kinda the top white it&#x27;s very dog and excellent with blending....if you just started learning to use brushes I definite recommend it&#x27;s not expensive which helps you how to learn to clean brushes once your set you can go for the big guns! The smell is there but it&#x27;s not a big deal at all these girls on the other reviews expect magic brushes for 12 dollars! I do recommend and I had my friends buy them too! You won&#x27;t regret it!(:</li>
    <li> I love these very cheap and very good</li>
    <li> I waited about a month before posting a review. These brushes are great! I want to start off by saying these are the first makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I did notice a slight smell after opening the packages but after a few days of airing out the smell disappeared. I didn&#x27;t notice a trace of the scent after applying makeup during the few days. My one complaint, which doesn&#x27;t big me as much as it might others is the metal part that holds the brush to the wooden handle is coming loose and when I apply makeup with it it wiggles a little bit. But I&#x27;d imagine that after it comes off I can super glue it back on. Bottom line is these brushes are amazing and definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes !!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality. Saved a ton on these instead if buying brushes from ulta. Just wish they had smaller prescision brushes for eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I like the ones from Bare Minerals better.</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever!! I love them! Definitely will but again!</li>
    <li> Love this set, had everything I need for my morning routine. Can&#x27;t believe the price, such a good deal.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. I would recommend it for those who likes to save and get good stuff with good price.</li>
    <li> Great Quality brushes but they smell toxic, I don&#x27;t know if its the glue they used to make the brushes, just soak them him in cool water and dove soap to get the smell out!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and useful. There is pretty strong chemical smell when you first get them but sense they&#x27;re synthetic brushes i wasn&#x27;t surprised really. The smell goes away after you let them air out for a day so its not huge deal.</li>
    <li> Really good quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Recently washed them and they haven&#x27;t shed once</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for almost a month and they are so soft and they have not shed. I love them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft. None of hairs from the brush shed . I&#x27;m very impressed</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but they feel great, produces even foundation coverage and my biggest plus is I&#x27;m not picking the bristles off my face after using.</li>
    <li> More brushes than I probably needed, but are incredibly soft and uses less makeup. Wish there were eye shadow brushes, there is a few brushes I have no clue what they would be used for</li>
    <li> Leaves a matte finish! Love it! Just wished they were labeled instead of going through the hassle of using the wrong brush for the wrong application.</li>
    <li> Brushes are just wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love using these brushes!</li>
    <li> For the price these are very nice!</li>
    <li> YES!!!! Love them. Even though they are synthetic and not goat hair brushes still nice quality for a decent price. Contours and shapes your face flawlessly! Next best thing to my MAC pro brushes. Will give another review in a few months on how they hold up and last. But very soft and not harsh on face!! A+</li>
    <li> I loved the brushes. They blend full coverage foundations well. A tad bit of shedding but I sprayed them with fix plus and they were perfect. 5 stars for the great quality but low price.</li>
    <li> I got my brush pretty quick and I love them. Their so soft and for that price you can&#x27;t beat. They didn&#x27;t have a smell. For such a great price these brushes are great!!!☺👍</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and dense. I have not seen any shedding so far. I really love these brushes for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;after just over one month of use one the brushes has broken. The handle fell of of it, and two more of them have loose handles. I still like the the brushes they have stayed soft and kept their shape through multiple washings, and I still have not seen any shedding. I plan to buy another set but this time I will keep my hot glue gun handy for repairs as another reviewer suggested.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes they are soft and affordable</li>
    <li> Great brushed- very full!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. The price is awesome but would never think these brushes were this good..</li>
    <li> Nice set for the price. All of the brushes are very soft. I wish a couple of them were a little less feathery.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, great price!</li>
    <li> Got my brushes today and they work great. Only downside is they smelled like paint but it wasn&#x27;t very strong. For the price I paid I am very pleased. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Super soft &amp; blend well ! I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Not bad considering the low low price.  I wear bare essentials foundation and the brushes work well with it.</li>
    <li> Love these! They are soft and great for price. They do come with a smell, but goes away once you clean them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing for the price. Came sooner than expected! Great quality and super soft! Really a great set...remind me alot of sigma brushes!  Very high end quality!!</li>
    <li> I love my new brushes !!! they are so cute and the brushes are soft so its nice to the skin. I&#x27;m a happy girl :D</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re really soft and work really well on blending. really glad I bought these brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!!!! Perfect!!</li>
    <li> I love this brushes and they get the job done!!!!!!;~}</li>
    <li> Happy for the price, I now have a wide array of brushes to follow along in all those YouTube makeup videos! I have not had problems with the handles coming off as others have mentioned.  Brushes are very soft.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loveeee this brushes received a set yesterday morning. Started to apply my makeup today and I love them I originally  bought them for my makeup kit. Because I am a pro mua. But I wanted to try them before using on my customers  I loved them so much I will be keeping the one I received for me and just placed a another order right now  so worth buying</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft. They blend out my makeup so flawlessly. They did have a weird smell when they first arrived but one wash and it was gone.</li>
    <li> Very soft, do not shed, would be better if each brush was labeled.</li>
    <li> Look nice quality. Arrived before estimated delivery date!</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the money i use them all the time</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;My issue is, I&#x27;ve been using them for a week and they are already shedding which sucks.</li>
    <li> Its a good product and i like it</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes, great quality!</li>
    <li> these brushes are awesome blend very good,they did have a loud smell but it went away after washing them with water,The handles on my brushes did not break and they are very sturdy I do recommend this product and the shipping was fast with my amazon prime membership</li>
    <li> Totally loving this brush set.  Wash your brushes when you first get them.  I use Castile soap, and the smell was gone in no time.  Dense, soft well made brushes.  In fact the precision tapered brush is my new favorite as a crease brush.  They aren&#x27;t labeled but several reviewers has outlined what each brush can be used for.  Thanks will repurchase when needed.</li>
    <li> These bristles do fall out a bit while using , other then that they are pretty good quality for the price .</li>
    <li> I bought these so I didn&#x27;t have to take my expensive brushes on vacation. They will do the job.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and loved the price..</li>
    <li> Wow.  I&#x27;m surprised that I only paid $$ for these and they are good quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! The coverage they give it great. I would of gave it 5 stars if they didn&#x27;t needed a little work themselves. When I went to apply my eye shadow the brush base came undone from the tip. Nothing a little hot glue couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good brushes, but not quite excellent. I took off a star because on one of the brushes, the paint seemed melted. There was also another brush where the handle came off. Even before I used it.</li>
    <li> I think for the price these are the best brushes on the market right now</li>
    <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. My foundation comes out flawless I put down my Mac stippling brush for these babies!</li>
    <li> Very soft and smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> Alright so, these brushes are amazing. They make my foundation application 5x faster and easier, with a flawless finish. &amp; my eye makeup has never looked better, they don&#x27;t come labeled but it&#x27;s purposes are obvious &amp; they have a smell on them that leave the next day (at least it did for me) they are amazing and for a price like this, you can&#x27;t pass up. Buy buy buy!!!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed! I used it once and the brush simply broke off!</li>
    <li> Wow I&#x27;m amaze with the quality and the quick delivery! Great product overall satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes- they work just as well as my more expensive ones, and the hairs do not fall out like so many cheap brushes I have tried before. My only complaint is that the brush I use the most (for contouring) has already fallen off of the handle. I shove it back in, but it is always falling apart.</li>
    <li> There is definitely a distinct scent, but it goes away quickly after opening, the brushes themselves are wonderful. So soft! And great for blending. They are sturdy and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
    <li> they easy to dis-attache.. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised about how great these brushes are. All you have to do when you get them is wash them with shampoo and let them dry! Totally recommend getting these brushes if you are looking for inexpensive good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I know there is mix reviews on this product. But the shipping was fast. The brushes are just like the photo. Mine didn&#x27;t come apart like some others. Did somewhat smell like paint when opened. But will go away. I love them.. For the price!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Dense and sturdy. Did have a chemical smell when they first got here but not anymore.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes. No issues at all with these, they were a great buy for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Love them super smooth great buy and a great price.... was not expecting good quality for the price definitely worth it</li>
    <li> This product is not worth the money at all!! 2 of the brushes were broken and they are already falling apart. I had to super glue the brush back together! Do not waste your money</li>
    <li> 💞amazing brushes !! make up goes on smooth, blends very well and awesome price!! even came before delivery date !! 💯happy coustomer</li>
    <li> Amazing product for the money. I use the bigger brushes to apply my foundation and my bb cream. Super soft and dense the way I like my face brushes. The eye brushes are okay but mainly I&#x27;m impressed with the face brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived sooner then what it said they were(about 3/4 days!). The handles smell a little like paint, but that does go away.&lt;br /&gt;And the brushes are so AMAZING! They blend products really easily and, honestly, they feel like their the high quality ones from Sephora or Ulta! Really recommend if you are looking for good quality brushes but don&#x27;t wanna spend your whole paycheck!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for the price! The bristles don&#x27;t shed and they&#x27;re very soft. I love every size and shape that comes in the set. they&#x27;re easy to use and clean. I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that the foundation, blush and bronzer/contouring brushes come apart easily at the handle. Each broke within the first week of using them, however, It&#x27;s not a big deal because the brush still works just fine. And for the money I paid, I&#x27;m still happy with the product. The handles could easily be glued back with some wood glue if it were a big problem.</li>
    <li> Sooo worth the money! Love these brushes!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that good the handle of one of my brushes came off, and I only been using it for a couple of weeks, other than that I like the brushes.</li>
    <li> The only thing bad about the brush is the hairs on the brush get stuck on your face but they are really soft.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of the brushes, theyre so soft &amp; products can be applied very smoothy. I would have gave it a better rating but the head of the brush actually came off for one.</li>
    <li> These make up brushes seem okay so far. I&#x27;ve made a first look video that I will most likely put on YouTube... on one of the brushes there was some gummy stuff and the top fell off of one of them but I am okay with that, as they were very cheap and still are very good brushes as far as I can tell....but I haven&#x27;t used them yet, I would recommend giving them a shot.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very soft and are amazing. The first was there was only one small hair that came out but I have washed them 3 times and they are still perfect. I bought one for me and one for a friend and one of them did come with a strong paint smell from the painted handles but it didn&#x27;t last long at all. I would buy them again without question.</li>
    <li> excellent brushes. good the application of shadows and cream products, really exceeded my expectations for as low</li>
