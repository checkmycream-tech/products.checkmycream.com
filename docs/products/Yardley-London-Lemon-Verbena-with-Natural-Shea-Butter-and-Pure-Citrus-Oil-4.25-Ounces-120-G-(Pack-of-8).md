    <li> I&#x27;m basing my review on the fact that I want to smell good with a fragrance soap.  Some people are more discreet; that&#x27;s not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-smells nice&lt;br /&gt;-lathers really well&lt;br /&gt;-the bar lasts long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-weak scent.  For the price, I was expecting a soap whose smell would last; this literally disappears the minute you step out of the shower.  I get more mileage out of a pack of Irish Spring.</li>
    <li> great scent and a nice quality soap</li>
    <li> I love this soap for 3 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin feeling and smelling great, the variety of fragrances it comes in, and the company does not perform animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap to anyone!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I like that lemon smell in a shower, but I do. If you do, you will also love these soap bars from Yardley. What&#x27;s more, they seem to clean pretty well too. Buy them in bulk!</li>
    <li> Simple soap with minimal and natural ingredients along with a light, refreshing scent.  For people like me who are sensitive to a lot of the chemicals and junk in normal soap, this stuff works amazingly well.  It&#x27;s also easier to find and cheaper in bulk when compared to most Castile soap (some forms of which cause a temporary burning sensation when used on my face and back).  If you&#x27;re looking for a mild, natural soap for sensitive skin, try this.</li>
    <li> Different kind of fragrance mixture. Takes some getting used to. Would still recommend it. Great for my face especially since I have combination oily/normal skin</li>
    <li> I love the smell, and the softness of this soap.  It has such a fresh lemony smell and it is the best.</li>
    <li> Have always loved Yardley products.Shared with my friends.and they love it also. Makes drawers smell nice also. Didn&#x27;t Yardley make an Apple Spray at one time?</li>
    <li> Beautifully scented quality soap.  I use it for salon type body care and in the kitchen to eliminate onion and garlic odors from my hands.</li>
    <li> Folks, I found this bar (and all the other Yardley fragrances) at...wait for it...Dollar Tree!  This is a lovely soap, but at this price?? Especially when you can get it for less. mb</li>
    <li> Smells nice, exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Yardley of London&#x27;s Lemon Verbena with shea butter is a wonderful hard milled soap. It has a light earthy lemon verbena aroma that is delicate with  warm overtones. Leaves skin soft &amp; rinses well. It is long lasting. Nice to add a bar to linen drawers &amp; anywhere you&#x27;d like to impart the subtle aroma  to lift the spirit!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to lavender - this smells nothing like lemon verbena. Despite the description, see package which shows a lavender plant much larger than the lemon one, which is the reality. If you want lavender frngrance, this is the soap for you. If you want lemon, do not order this.</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Not too expensive. Smells nice. My partner says that it is drying. I haven&#x27;t had the same experience, though.</li>
    <li> Chose this product to scent dresser drawers and linens.  Yardley always has the most wonderful fragrances and this is one of my favorites.  Have used them all tucked away here and there.  Great!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, does not irritate the skin, and hard to find locally.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> My daughter had a systemic allergic reaction within seconds of her using this soap in the bath today. She had itching, hives, swollen hands, swollen feet, swollen nasal passages, numb, tingling hands, shortness of breath, and nausea.  She has needed Benadryl all day. I&#x27;m throwing the soap out and scrubbing the bathroom to remove any potential residue.</li>
    <li> Another Yardley soap that I love...  How am I going to choose between fragrances when it&#x27;s time to re-order???</li>
    <li> Lovely soap, lovely fragrance, and long lasting bar; I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I look forward to the scent every morning.  It&#x27;s a very rich soap.  I never feel dried out.</li>
    <li> Not sure what some of the ingredients in here are, but I&#x27;m itching like crazy. I&#x27;ve never had a bad allergic reaction to soap before. I haven&#x27;t changed my diet, haven&#x27;t changed my laundry detergent. This is the only change I&#x27;ve made. Been like this for a week now. I won&#x27;t be using this anymore...maybe it&#x27;s the citrus? I don&#x27;t know. It smells nice, though.</li>
    <li> We use this almost exclusively. Love the fragrance. But I will say the soap dissolves too fast!</li>
    <li> Bought this after the French and Hawaiian soaps got too expensive. Smells good, lathers good, and doesn&#x27;t make me itch.</li>
