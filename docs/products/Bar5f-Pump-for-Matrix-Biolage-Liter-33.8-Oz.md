<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easier than picking up the bottle.  Gets my Husband to use and not complain.  Good size and easy to use.  Exactly what you would expect and hope for in this product.</li>
    <li> easier to use shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> It was part of a gift! I sure hope it works well.</li>
    <li> These pumps do not fit the 33.8 oz bottles as specified.  When I notified them of this, they said that they do not fit the \\&quot;old\\&quot; 33.8oz bottles, but I&#x27;ve looked all over and these \\&quot;old\\&quot; bottles are at all the stores.  Scam.</li>
    <li> It fits the new liter bottles perfectly. Waiting to see how long it lasts. It is clear instead of the white, but works fine.</li>
    <li> Did not fit bottle as described.</li>
    <li> What can you say, but this product works as expected. It is well made, easy to pump and looks good.</li>
    <li> Works like it should , makes the Matrix bottles easy to use.  Nothing has fallen apart so I would say they are sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> glad i got these , can&#x27;t imagine picking these up on and off every time i shower , these work great !</li>
    <li> Theses did not fit my Matrix Biolage Color Care one liter bottles like the picture showed. Would still like to find some that fit the Color Care. A good value though for someone who can use them!</li>
    <li> This makes everything so much easier then trying to get the cap open. I just wish mine was white but it really doesn&#x27;t matter. I recommend this and I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The pump came in black and not white as shown in picture.  The biolage bottles are white, so it doesn&#x27;t look very nice with the black pump.  The pump works perfectly so far, I just wish they would have sent the white one.</li>
    <li> Got a Biolage gift set for the holidays, unfortunately the bottle are a bit hard to manage in the shower with your eyes closed. So glad I found these pumps, once I received them I put them in the bottles and now I get the perfect amount of shampoo or conditioner every time. Best of all, I don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping the bottles on my toe.</li>
    <li> I buy large bottles of Biolage shampoo, etc. and eventually the large pumps get a little dingy looking.  I was told that I couldn&#x27;t purchase new pumps with my new shampoo at the local dealers and was delighted to see that I could on line.</li>
    <li> Works as it&#x27;s supposed to. Shipped timely. Saves me from having to lift the big liter bottles each day. No problems so far.</li>
    <li> Works well so far in my shampoo and conditioner bottles.  So far nothing has plugged up and just the right amount comes out with each squirt.</li>
    <li> Received black pump; I would&#x27;ve preferred white and wish they would have stated that I may receive a different color. It does work well and fits the bottle, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal to me.  The shipping was fast; I received the product just days after ordering it.</li>
    <li> I have a 33 oz. bottle of shampoo that is very unwieldy to handle in the shower because the pump won;t stay assembled. Guess I&#x27;m going to have to put that shampoo in smaller, more convenient bottles.</li>
    <li> Great pump, no more lifting up the heavy bottles</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t by If you think it is going to fit the 32 oz bottles it is too short.  Don&#x27;t buy use Sally&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I really like buying in bulk for my family and having this pump to put in the bottles makes it easier for the kids to use.  Less waste too.</li>
    <li> This item is advertised to fit 33.8 oz Matrix Biolage bottles...well guess what? it doesn&#x27;t fit at all.  The threading inside the pump cap does not line up with the threading on the bottle neck.  If it wasn&#x27;t for a resourceful husband altering the damned thing to fit, it would have never worked.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this purchase and will obviously never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT IN THE BIG BOTTLES OF SHAMPOO, CONDITIONER &amp; GELEE</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re planning to purchase the 32 oz bottles of shampoo and/or conditioner this pump is amazing!  I like that the large bottles can be stationary and I use the same amount of shampoo and conditioner each time rather than pouring a varied amount into my hand each time.</li>
    <li> Nice heavy pump.  Well made.  Goes great with my 33.8 fluid oz. bottle of  shampoo that I purchased on-line. Right now my right hand is in a cast and I have to use my left hand to pump, with no problem.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out yet how to unlock or open this yet so I can&#x27;t use it yet.  I&#x27;ll love that I found this once I can do that.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these pumps and they fit perfectly on the bottles the description said it would! Highly recommend, but I also highly recommend the seller to LOWER THE PRICE!! I mean they are great pumps, but really expensive!! :\</li>
    <li> It makes life so much easier!  Works great!  I will be ordering another set for my daughters shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> It fit the bottle and makes dispensing in the shower so much easier. I purchased for shampoo and now have to order another for conditioner.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the bottle well. It&#x27;s a mess.</li>
    <li> Love this pump! I should have ordered more.</li>
    <li> I am so grateful I found these. Makes using the liter bottle so much easier in the shower. Too bad the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t include them on the bottle. But glad I can find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Took a bit to wrestle it on the 33.8 ounce bottle of conditioner. Once I figured out how to release the lock it worked great. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> It fit perfect and helps to dispense the appropriate amount.</li>
    <li> makes it so much easier to use the shampoo, highly recommend this product was worried it would not fit .</li>
    <li> Works great with the shampoo bottles</li>
    <li> I received it by the delivery date, but it does not fit the Matrix Biolage 33.8 oz bottles. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Work good no problems. I had a little trouble getting them to work at first but figured it out.</li>
    <li> I got 2 of these and also got a set of 4 generic pumps to see which worked best. These are better as they reach the bottom of the bottle and the others were slightly shorter. This pump fits the Matrix Biolage bottle perfectly and the generic thread cap was a little short. This pump also puts out a larger volume per pump with a larger diameter tube than the generic pumps. The color is not what I expected as the ad showed black and the pumps are like a beige with a greenish tone, my bottles are white, but the color does not matter to me. I definitely recommend this pump.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for biology pumps and these are perfect! They are sturdy and do exactly what I was hoping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought two pumps to attach to my shampoo as well as my conditioner. While they were delivered promptly, they would not fit in my shampoo nor conditioner. Really don&#x27;t know what to do with them now.</li>
    <li> This is great for the bottle of large shampoo and conditioner preventing me from accidentally dropping it on my foot in the shower</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine…and necessary for the liter bottles which are just too heavy to manage otherwise.</li>
    <li> Perfect to make my large bottles easier to manage.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t fit Matrix shampoo bottles?!?</li>
    <li> Pump clearly says it is for the Biolage Liter/33.8 shampoo bottle, but the pump does not fit that bottle.  The mouth of the bottle is larger than the pump and it won&#x27;t screw on.</li>
    <li> I use less product with the pump on.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased 2 of these for her 33.8 oz Biolage shampoo and conditioner bottles. Unfortunately, neither one of the pumps fit either one of the bottles. They would not screw in properly and were too large for the bottles.</li>
    <li> Pump works great, makes handling those big shampoo and conditioner bottles so easy! Pumps out the perfect amount each time too! Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Thought I would need this for the large Matrix Biolage Shampoo bottle and still believe this. Manages to work but it is flimsy and I doubt that it will last long.</li>
    <li> Got the pump and it fits the bottle, 330z perfectly!!! I love it and will dispense the shampoo nicely and save me money!!!</li>
    <li> Could not live without this pump in my shampoo! Works every time!</li>
    <li> I am so excited I found these! They fit on our bottles perfectly and they don&#x27;t even make a mess.</li>
    <li> I bought these to go on my coffee syrup bottles so I could easily pump the syrup in my cup before I brew my coffee.  They fit perfectly and work really well.</li>
    <li> Love this to go with the Shampoo I purchased....</li>
    <li> I wish Biolage sold these with the shampoo. My Biolage is lasting longer since I have this. Great price, very useful. I put off buying this for sometime, I don&#x27;t know why I waited.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a liter bottle of Matrix shampoo. Fits well and easy to open. Perfect for the purpose for which I needed it.</li>
    <li> What can I say it works well.. no issues. Better price here than other sites. I recommend it.. try it.</li>
    <li> This pump was recommended to be purchased together with the Biolage Colorcaretherapie Shampoo &amp; Conditioner (1 liter), which I purchased and received recently. This pump works perfectly with the Biolage Colorcaretherapie Shampoo and Conditioner (1 liter). The difference in color and varying reviews did worry me but I am glad it turned out just fine.</li>
    <li> Worked just fine for Matrix Biolage Volumatherapie and they were white.</li>
    <li> One of the sizes is not long enough to get to the bottom of the larger bottles.</li>
    <li> Good pump and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> The color sent matched my bottles perfectly!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for my shampoo and one for my conditioner.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from reading the other reviews. what color they would be or if Theo would fit. But for the price I thought it worth it to take a chance besides the black wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much. Well they came in clear and they fit perfect!!!  I say for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cap specifically for a bottle of Matrix shampoo, I already had a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; liter pump which did not fit the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cap is the same size as a regular pump, not the slightly larger diameter one that is required.  For the price, it&#x27;s not worth returning.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly in the bottle! I have been using this for 2-3 months now and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> useless because it doesn&#x27;t include the tube. the description says nothing about the need for a tube and is very misleading. waste of money. especially considering $5.85 is hardly worth the effort of returning. i&#x27;ll have to search for a tube!</li>
    <li> Some reviewers said this pump did not work but i found it to work perfectly. for the 33.8 oz container of Biolage shampoo. With out the pump the bottle would be too difficult to handle in the shower.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I wanted and needed.  The length was also great. I also like the fact that it is very hard plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This thing pumps like a sonofagun! High quality plastic pieces used throughout, glad the manufacturer took the time to build a sturdy product. Nothing like writing a review for a shampoo pump.</li>
    <li> I got two of these, they came in a pearly white, but I wouldn&#x27;t care about any color. I&#x27;m not trying to impress anyone with my shampoo bottles ;) They fit my brand new (as of May 2015) Matrix Biolage 33.8oz shampoo and conditioner bottles perfectly! They function GREAT. I&#x27;m super happy with these.</li>
    <li> Makes conditioning my hair easier.</li>
    <li> My pumps for my shampoo and conditioner work great. The seller I bought from was somewhat slow on the shipping.</li>
    <li> works great with the shampoo &amp; conditioner bottles!!  keeps me from using too much!!</li>
    <li> It was pictured as white and came in red.  I tried to contact seller for an exchange and got no response.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Meets needs.</li>
    <li> Hurray! This makes opening &amp; closing the lid a non-issue. I have arthritis in my hands &amp; as much as I love Matrix Biolage, I almost switched because of no pump. This works perfectly and makes hair washing a pleasure.</li>
    <li> Works great for the large bottles of Biolage shampoo and conditioner.  Now I don&#x27;t waste so much by pouring too much in my hands, I can pump a smaller amount and save on the product.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for the shampoo/conditioner bottles.</li>
    <li> This fits the new bottles perfectly as stated, we ordered the 33.8 Matrix Biolage Normalizing Shampoo and Detangling Solution and two of these pumps and were were all set.</li>
    <li> The pumps are useless without the tubes included to reach the bottom of the bottles.  I would love to be able to use the pump, but my shipment came without the tubes and I haven&#x27;t been as to find this part for purchase separately.  Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> Essential for the large containers!!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, now I don&#x27;t have to struggle to open the caps on my shampoo and conditioner daily while ripping my nails up in the process, these pumps are sturdy and fit perfectly, not flimsy at all.</li>
    <li> It is great and vesry easy to manipulate in the shower.  I have used Matrix for grey hair for years, but suddenly my salon stopped carrying it.  After looking here.  there and everywhere, I tried Amazon.  As always they came to the rescue and my hair is very grateful.</li>
    <li> Item as stated and shipped promptly!</li>
    <li> Works perfect. I do wish I could chose different colors. One for shampoo and one for conditioner...those bottles have little bitty writing and it&#x27;s hard to tell them apart so different colored pumps would help.</li>
    <li> works great dispenses just the right amount for a&lt;br /&gt;great shampoo..would recommend it for the&lt;br /&gt;Matrix shampoo bottle it works</li>
    <li> This works perfectly for the 33.8 oz shampoo bottle but would not fit the conditioner bottle. The pump is a must for the larger bottles.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for: Matrix Biolage Colorcaretherapie Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner Set 33.8oz 1 Liter each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was speedy. This is exactly what I wanted. I almost bought a less expensive generic set of pumps. But some reviewers noted that even though the generic stated a Matrix fit... they did not fit Matrix. So I&#x27;m glad I purchased these.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for these for a while...They came quickly and they are perfect! My Shampoo and Conditioner now are easier to get out!</li>
    <li> I buy my daughter liter size bottles of Biolage shampoo and conditioner because it is such a better deal than the smaller bottles. But the bottles are big and not all that easy to handle in the shower when one is standing under a shower head. I saw these pumps made for the matrix bottles and bought two for her. She loves them and it&#x27;s much easier to push on a pump while standing in the shower than trying to handle a big bottle standing under a shower head.</li>
    <li> Did not fit my bottle of Biolage shampoo. It wasn&#x27;t worth returning since the shipping would have been more than the item itself.</li>
    <li> This pump fit well on my 33.8 oz. Biolage shampoo. The straw was a tiny bit too long and so it took some time to get the cap to screw on, but I am glad to know that the straw fits all the way to the bottom of the bottle. Works great! My pump was the light tan color exactly as it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, fits matrix biology liter pumps. Some people were complaining that the color didn&#x27;t match their bottles but seriously? It goes in the shower, I&#x27;m not worried about coordination of colors in there.</li>
    <li> Good job. its fits good...</li>
    <li> Sturdy and functional, but not the highest quality item.</li>
    <li> this never fit properly - waste of a few bucks!</li>
    <li> Bought for a replacement for a broken pump. Works as promised!</li>
    <li> Fits both conditioner and shampoo and works great. A must have for the bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t listen to the other reviews here.  I almost didn&#x27;t buy these due to the fact that others were saying they didn&#x27;t fit, didn&#x27;t work, etc.!  THEY DO FIT PERFECTLY and work just as PERFECTLY...you really need these for these HUGE bottles!  As far as the color of the pump top, does it REALLY matter?!?!?  Yes, mine are black and not the white as shown in the photo but once again I have to ask...does it matter?!?!?  If esthtically it doesn&#x27;t matter to you, you shouldn&#x27;t live without them for these big Matrix Biolage bottles!</li>
    <li> for the price its a great product, works as escrowed, i think it should included with the shampoo and not an add on product.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and it&#x27;s good product.</li>
    <li> I needed a pump for my 33.8 ounce conditioner.  This was for a fair price and shipped quickly.  No more having to pick up the bottle.  Luckily this pump sits higher than my shampoo so there&#x27;s no mix up.</li>
    <li> These pumps are pretty flimsy to begin with .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I received copper pumps which look stupid on white biolage bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the trouble to return</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, and only one of them worked correctly. But the one that worked correctly works great!</li>
