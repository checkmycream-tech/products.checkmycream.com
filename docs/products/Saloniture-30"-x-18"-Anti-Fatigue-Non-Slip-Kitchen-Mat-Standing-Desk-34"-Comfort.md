      <li>This Saloniture mat is nice, but it didn&#x27;t work well in my kitchen.  </li>
      <li>We own a bookstore and purchased three of these mats.  </li>

      <li>Now if only I could make the entire rest of my house feel this good on my feet and legs.</li>
      <li>Such a more reasonable price online compared to what I had found in local stores.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly at my newly converted standing workstation.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely, thick mat and does not slip or cause tripping.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mat is covered in a plastic material that gets very slippery when wet.</li>
      <li>(like a relative&#x27;s professional grade home kitchen)</li>

    <li> Excellent service, good product.</li>
    <li> It is made to comfort your feet while standing long periods of time and it made to its standards. Excellent.</li>
    <li> If there was a zero star option, I would us that one. I am so disappointed with this product, but what I find most outrageous is that the seller requires the buyer to pay for the return of the item, in circumstances in which the product description is misleading and inaccurate. The buyer is not informed of this policy upfront. It is only after you receive the item, find out there&#x27;s a problem with it and seek a return, that you are being slapped with the notification of the return charges. So unfair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mat is covered in a plastic material that gets very slippery when wet. I could have fallen and broken my neck, but I was lucky. The thickness of the mat creates another hazard, as you can easily trip over it, despite the sloped edges. It wouldn&#x27;t be so if the mat had cushioning property, but it doesn&#x27;t. The the plastic cover takes away the flexibility and cushioning effect of the foam core, and it makes you feel as if you&#x27;re stepping on an unstable, hard surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed. This is a ripoff.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my stand-up workstation at home. Knees feel better and I feel more comfy standing than I did.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, thick mat and does not slip or cause tripping. The smooth surface is easy to clean, and resistant to dents.</li>
    <li> Great mat! Gives nice cushion when standing on it!</li>
    <li> This Saloniture mat is nice, but it didn&#x27;t work well in my kitchen.  It&#x27;s almost an inch high and very comfortable, but I kept stumbling over it.  I&#x27;m used to mats that are much less deep. I have replaced it with a thinner one, and given the Saloniture to my son-in-law to use in his garage.  He loves it!!!</li>
    <li> This mat is perfect and exactly what I needed.  It allows me to stand on my feet at work without pain and alleviates my back ache.  The size is perfect and I highly recommend it to people that have to stand in place for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> I have a standing desk at work and this adds just the right amount of comfort while standing.</li>
    <li> I use this with my standing desk at work.  It is very thick and &amp;#34;cushiony&amp;#34;.  As its surface is smooth, it is easy to keep clean unlike some decorative versions I own.  In my office there is only carpet over cement; so this mat was crucial in order to stand all day without pain.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I need for my standup desk. Awesome. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Very comfortable and so far durable. Plus, that you can clean it off with a damp rag. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Working long meals in the kitchen is less painful, this mat is great</li>
    <li> Perfect  size for behind our Sushi bar! The staff thanks you!</li>

    <li> Amazing. Now if only I could make the entire rest of my house feel this good on my feet and legs.</li>
    <li> Great product, looks and feels good. Perfect size for small kitchen. Quick shipping.i will order again when these wear out.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Works perfectly at my newly converted standing workstation.</li>
    <li> Feels great when standing on it but over time the corners have begun to curl up and become a trip hazard.</li>
    <li> .Nice cushioned  mat. I purchase it to absorb the vibration from a portable air conditioner on my hardwood floors - works well</li>
    <li> great in front of dishwasher and sink</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why my experience with this product is so unlike the others that were so favorable. I placed my order relying on them and because I wanted something for a small kitchen but when I unpacked it, put it on my kitchen floor and stepped on it I was instantly disappointed.  It felt like it had a sort of plastic covering on top so that when I stepped on it it just kind of flattened out and provided no support whatsoever.  I actually turned it over and tried it that way and it was more like the gel cushions I&#x27;ve tried elsewhere (like a relative&#x27;s professional grade home kitchen) but it slid around and I decided I would never be happy with it and I might as well return it.  I contacted the seller and received a prompt reply and return authorization so no complaints there but it ended up costing $11 to return the thing (and it only cost $30).  I figured getting $20 back was better than nothing at all but the whole experience was a disappointment and an exercise in frustration. I&#x27;m debating spending another $20 and ordering the $50 GelPro but now I&#x27;m skittish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that the status of this product is \\&quot;currently unavailable\\&quot; -- I wish that had been true when I ordered it a week ago -- but I&#x27;ll still post this as a caution.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, easy to clean!</li>
