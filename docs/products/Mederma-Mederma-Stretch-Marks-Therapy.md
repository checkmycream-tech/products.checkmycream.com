<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very good cream for skin marks, I recommend this product, it is not cheap but is very good to removed skin marks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 8 months. The stretch marks are definitely lighter than 8 months ago. Will keep using it and see what happened.</li>
    <li> i had my 2nd baby and got a few white stretch marks below my belly button I have been using this as directed every day twice a day for about a month and also using a coffee body scrub I made on the area every day and I have noticed a huge difference it says best results in 12 wks I am definitely going to buy another bottle</li>
    <li> palmers stretch mark cream is way better than this stuff. this product is way over priced.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product, I was following directions and put it on morning and night. I didn&#x27;t see an immediate improvement, but then again, it&#x27;s hard to physically see any difference when you&#x27;re looking at your legs every day. I took pictures every day instead, and compared them. While I&#x27;ve slacked off a little (moving back home for the summer, job) on application, I still use it at night and massage it really well. I also use it on stretchmarks that haven&#x27;t yet appeared, but I can tell are on their way to stretch mark territory, and it seems to ward them off. If you are vigilant about the application, I believe results would be better than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint about the product is that there isn&#x27;t enough of it. My stretch marks are largely on my thighs, and just applying the recommended amount empties the bottle fast. It&#x27;s too expensive for me to constantly purchase, but overall it&#x27;s worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> it does not work as fast&lt;br /&gt;does not always as promise so do believe it promises. so be aware. bye</li>
    <li> Feels good. Active ingredient says: skin protectant&lt;br /&gt;Not sure that it faded the stretch marks at all.&lt;br /&gt;Best way to prevent stretch marks? Eat healthy and don&#x27;t gain so much weight :$</li>
    <li> it didnt improve any of my stretch marks i didnt see any results and im disappointed i wish i wouldve known , but i will never try this again . i would not recommend this to anyone .</li>
    <li> Love the scent of it and of course its efficacy. I don&#x27;t see any stretch marks and didn&#x27;t have them with the 1st pregnancy either.</li>
    <li> Makes the wife feel good.</li>
    <li> No amazing results here, but i think i do see some improvement. It says 90 days continuous use is prescribed for results, but I don&#x27;t believe this bottle has enough for 90 days. If you want to commit to the usage as recommended, get at least two. I was using for my stomach and love handles area. I have other stretch marks around my side boobs, and i see a difference now. I&#x27;ll probably order more, and restart using again.&lt;br /&gt;A little background: I had my son 6.5 years ago, and never tried using this product before. I read that it&#x27;s recommended to use this as soon as possible, while the marks are fresh. If you can, do that. Hopefully, your results are even better than mine, with my well established marks.</li>
    <li> My stretch marks were 10 months old when I first started using this.  But I had used the regular mederma scar cream 4 weeks after delivery and it really worked well, but smelled awful and could not wear it during the day.  This cream is absorbed so much better by the skin, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it actually smells more like a lightly perfumed lotion.  I have been using this for four weeks now and my stretch marks are so much better already, I think in 4 more weeks I should be able to get into a bikini (I have marks all across my stomach).</li>
    <li> If you use it as directed you do see improvement.  It isn&#x27;t a miricale cream but it does help to fade stretch marks and reduce the look of their appearance some.  You must use it the entire twelve weeks, twice a day!</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical of this cream at first, but after about 9 weeks both the stretch marks and a scar I&#x27;ve been using it on have faded so much. Of course they&#x27;re not completely gone, so I&#x27;ll keep using it for longer than recommended, but it is truly amazing!</li>
    <li> So I bought this Mederma Stretch Mark cream about 3 weeks ago with my doubts even tho all the reviews said it worked but guess what yall...3 weeks in and they are visibly fading! I kid u not :) it says to use it for 12 weeks for full results but they are all ready lighter than they were...amazing. I did notice that I use it as instructed always on my belly b/c it&#x27;s easier to reach and to remember and those are the ones that are fading faster. However, I seem to forget about the ones on my backside and those aren&#x27;t fading as fast SO my advice for it to work:...use it as the bottle says. Morning and night, liberally in circles and you will get results :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product even though I read form other reviews that the smell was terrible. Indeed the fragrance is pretty bad, it smells \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;, strong smell, like patchouli. I only apply the cream at night for that reason so I&#x27;m not sure if I will ever see the entire effect of my stretch marks disappearing. Bummer!</li>
    <li> I started using this product 1yr after I had my baby, after a friend (who is an RN) recommended it to me.  I tried other products (ex: Palmers, cocoa butter lotion/creams, etc) and nothing seemed to work to help diminish the stretch marks I got over my pregnancy.  Plus, I really disliked the smell of the Palmers cream.  I thought it was a lot of money for the Mederma, but I finally broke down and bought it.  The tube lasted about a month and I have seen great results with the one tube I bought.  My stretch marks have faded greatly already (from red/pink to light pink in color) and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described. the item has met my expectation.</li>
    <li> Well I have been using this for awhile. And as you know, this isn&#x27;t cheap (compared to other stretch mark creams).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see no difference at all, except that my skin got darker (which made the stretch marks stick out even more - because they are lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
    <li> I used this for over a month but I found that \\&quot;Fade Out Stretchmark Creme by Tehani Salon\\&quot; on Amazon worked better. It smelled better and works faster than this stuff. I guess if you have nothing else to use that it would suffice. But I think it&#x27;s way over rated.</li>
    <li> First i am a guy .   i wanted to try this product on my belly .     3 months according to instructions required 4 tubes of this stuff .   during use i sow some improvement , once i stopped it changed back to how it used to look .     I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time and money on it .</li>
    <li> I didnt notice anything that the cream did..</li>
    <li> She has been using it to address post pregnancy stretch marks and is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> When I was researching this product I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere that said if it worked on all stretch marks or only new ones. I ordered it and the info that was enclosed stated only on new ones. Maybe this will help others wondering the same thing.</li>
    <li> Ordering another one right now</li>
    <li> This is the first lotion I have tried that I have really seen a differnce in my strectch marks!( I have tried everything, and have even paid up to 100 dollars! for other lotions with no results) In just 3 weeks of using Mederma for stretchmarks I noticed a smoother texture and the redness gone, I know nothing will make them go away 100% but this lotion gives me hope on making them look better than they have ever looked and it makes me feel more confident.  I just re-ordered, I will using as they recommend for 12 weeks so I will update my review once I am done...I would&#x27;ve rated them a 5 except I do think the scent is a little strong, its not bad but strong clean medically freshy scent. Looking foward to getting my new bottle. :) tbc..</li>
    <li> I definitely have to agree, this is definitely the best cream i have ever used and i have only been using it about 3 weeks. I have noticed the color getting better(lightening up), and the texture of my skin is a lot smoother, and i will also be using it the full 12 weeks recommended. It says in the box the results aren&#x27;t as good on old stretch marks, but mine are over 2 years old. I am very happy with this product and will most likely be using until i can afford laser treatments.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working but still using it.  Doctor tells me it&#x27;s probably snake oil.</li>
    <li> Excel skin cream works waaay better. Also it smelled really salty</li>
    <li> This review might be a little more helpful in a few months, but I started using the Mederma stretch marks cream about a month ago, and there are no signs of stretch marks yet.  I&#x27;m due on March 2nd, so I will let you know how it really works around that time.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is very uncomfortable taking her clothes off after 2 children. She has heavy scaring from stretch marks on her tummy and her breasts. I began using the product for a scar from an injury and liked the results so I purchased her the stretch mark version. Within 3 weeks she was already noticing a significant improvement in lightening the coloring of her stretch marks. Will try to update as she continues to use the product.</li>
    <li> Used this product on a few stubborn stretch marks on my shoulders and no difference was noticed 6 months later.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Mederma for about 3 or 4 weeks, twice daily.  So far I can&#x27;t really notice a difference in the stretch marks but the bottle says it takes up to 12 weeks to see results.  There is an interesting smell to the lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it seems to bother others.  I will definitely keep using it and hopefully by the end of the 12 weeks I can come and update my review to say what a big difference it has made.  However, so far. . . no noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to think yet-  I have used it for about 5 weeks now and my stomach strech marks seem smoother but still very noticable.  It states it takes 12 weeks so I am hoping my strech marks are not too deep to fade them a little.</li>
    <li> My wife &amp; I own a wellness center &amp; make our own line of aromatherapy products. Wile we don&#x27;t make a stretch mark solution I will say that if we did it would be nothing like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Read the ingredients, glycerin &amp; alcohol are the two worst things for your skin. Will open your cells &amp; suck out the much needed moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go out endorse anyone but just look for the ones with the simple oils. You don&#x27;t need chemicals &amp; fake lotions to ruin your skin. Remember that anything you put on your skin we end up in your baby.</li>
    <li> I must say I wasn&#x27;t for sure this stuff would work! My stretch marks were silver and I hadn&#x27;t tried anything to help them in over 7 years. I did a lot I did a lot of research and Maderma was the best stuff I could find. It&#x27;s expensive but it works. I&#x27;m almost done with this first bottle and I will defiantly buy more. My stretch marks are pink now and my husband says he bearly notices them. Thanks Maderma!</li>
    <li> Works great! Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive but it is worth the price. I need to get at LEAST two more tubes so plan on 4 total the results are totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I used 1 complete bottle on my stretch marks (more than 5 years old) and it didnt help at all.  The smell is strong, but there are ways to minimize it:  1)wash your hands after application, then 2)use some scented lotion, or perfume and it should be OK.  The box says that is for new stretch marks...so maybe is worth it to try it if that  is your case.  I saw zero improvement on mine.</li>
    <li> (CURRENTLY I&#x27;M 39 WEEKS PREGNANT) I STARTED NOTICING A BIG PURPLISH STRETCH MARK ON THE SIDE OF MY STOMACH. I WAS LIKE OMG I&#x27;M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO WEAR A TWO PIECE SWIM SUIT NEXT YEAR FOR THE SUMMER. SO I DID SOME RESEARCH AND THE REVIEWS FOR THIS TYPE OF MEDERMA WERE HIGH. I&#x27;VE PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND STARTED USING IT FOR OVER A MONTH&#x27;S PERIOD. ME AND MY HUSBAND NOTICE THAT THE MARK WAS GETTING LIGHTER AND LESS NOTICEABLE. I&#x27;M SO SATISFIED THAT I HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER BOX, IT&#x27;S REALLY WORTH IT ESPECIALLY WITH AMAZON&#x27;S FREE 2 DAY SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> I hate my stretchmarks and I&#x27;m always in a never ending quest for the best product, so I really wanted this cream to work. Used it for about 4 or 5 months and didn&#x27;t see significant results. Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for stretchmarks, the smell and texture are pleasant and it hydrates the skin apply it to.</li>
    <li> They get you with the money back guarantee and I would have returned it for a refund if it hadn&#x27;t been a gift. I used it religiously as directed for over 4 months. I WILL say my stretch marks have faded but with time they will fade anyway so who&#x27;s to say if it was the cream or the time I&#x27;ve had since having my baby.  Well, I&#x27;m guessing it was the time and the cream is a crock because I was overweight when younger and got lots of stretch marks which all faded on their own just like the ones on my belly have. I will invest in laser stretch mark removal over trying any thing else because miracle creams just don&#x27;t exist.</li>
    <li> Maderma is a great product. Obviously I know that my stretch marks are not going to completely disappear but Maderma did improve their appearance. I love the smell and the texture of the cream. It smooths on like normal lotion. I wish it were a little cheaper, but it still is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my stretch marks. This plus time and they drastically went away.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s stretch marks are fading and her skin is smooth. She Love&#x27;s Mederma. Will reorder from same shipper. She hasn&#x27;t been using it everyday, but still saw results within 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Received it fast trying it out hope I&#x27;ll be seeing results</li>
    <li> i was tiny before i got pregnant and i loved my body. i saw my first stretch mark at 39 weeks and i cried!  but now!! im happy again!! i can bearly see stretch marks after just a month of  use and i forget to apply it alot.</li>
    <li> This product works like wonders! Out of all the stretch mark products this is by far the best. Well recommended</li>
    <li> I got the off brand of Mederma at Walgreens and it has worked great. I also tried bio oil which didn&#x27;t work at all and I&#x27;m very disappointed I didn&#x27;t put Mederma on all my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> After major fat loss I was stuck with some bad stretch marks on my hips and biceps. I used this product once and seemed to work well. Yet about a week after I was done, the marks were back to how they were before. I tried it again...and absolutely nothing changed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to get rid of older stretch marks and it was a waste. I would only recommend using on newer stretch marks.</li>
    <li> slowly but surely. it makes my skin soft and smooth but the marks are slowly disappearing from my body. d</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical that anything could help fade the bright purple stretch marks that my daughter developed less than 6 months ago.  They were primarily on her legs, and seemed to attract a lot of negative attention.  We tried the cream (despite the cost), and hoped that it could do some good in the 4 weeks before she left for summer camp.  We are so pleased with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is stronger, but more like a scented body lotion and not at all unpleasant (it&#x27;s how I know she&#x27;s remembered to apply it day and night.)  One bottle won&#x27;t last the entire course of treatment -- we are on our second bottle -- but there was significant fading of the darker marks by the end of the first bottle, and the lighter marks are completely gone.  I can&#x27;t say enough how this has been a miracle for my family -- no prescription or professional treatment required!  (I don&#x27;t know how it would work on older marks.  Our experience with new ones, however, couldn&#x27;t be more impressive.)</li>
    <li> I know that there are different skin types, but Maderma should have specified if this item is for naturally BROWN skin (as in African-Americans, Hispanics, Indian, etc) and the stretch marks that we get, which tend to be different in color. I have bought two tubes in 6 weeks. I use it two times a day...and there is NO difference. I really wish there was a money back guarantee! I have seen it on here for $29.99 and in the drug stores it is $45.00, so truat me, your saving money THIS way. I am going back to my $75.00 Strivectin Sd cream, because that actually worked for me...I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have almost used up my first tube, ordering my second now. I used it for all of June, July and August - though not as often as the instructions state. I have noticed that the stretch marks from my recent pregnancy (delivered March 31) have decreased in color significantly.  I would recommend this to anyone. I also gave it four stars for the VERY strong scent.  I do not dislike it, but I know there are people who are very sensitive to scents and this would be very unpleasant for those folks.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all very disappointed</li>
    <li> I used 1 container consistently and didn&#x27;t have any noticeble results.   Too expensive to continue using.  I use Avon stretch mark creams and love them.</li>
    <li> great product it works excellent,...i know it says it doesnt work on old stretchmarks but i have actually noticed a difference... i would buy this product again</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and actually works.  I had one very distinct stretch mark about 4 weeks ago I had developed from being pregnant ( I am 6 months pregnant now) and have watched it fade and almost completely go away.  No new marks since I started using it.  Just a dime size amount in the palm, rub it all over my belly after i shower and wow....it works.  This was a gift from a friend and she ordered me a few more so I am exited becuase it really does live up to it&#x27;s promise.</li>
    <li> I have used mederma and i saw no changes i m so depressed about my stretch marks,i felt so hopeful about mederma but just got disappointed....</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
    <li> Noticed some change but not a lot.</li>
    <li> I saw no results, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a hard type of product to review, since how can we know for sure what would have happened without using it.  However I do notice that after 10 weeks now my wife&#x27;s stretch marks are well faded.  I did a lot of research on it before we decided to buy, and it seems that the consensus is that you must use it soon after pregnancy and you must use it for at least 3 months (twice daily).  My wife is small and found that one tube lasts 6 weeks, and other than the strong scent I can&#x27;t say much bad about it.  It is no \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; cream but it does seem to help.</li>
    <li> My wife didn&#x27;t get ANY stretch marks until AFTER the baby was born when her milk came in. She used this as directed and it didn&#x27;t work. She said she used mederma scar cream when she was younger and that did work so was hopeful with this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 4 weeks now and have noticed a slight lightening of my skin. I will continue to use and hope it will work... It just seems like a very slow process.</li>
    <li> I wish I had done more research before I had bought this lotion. Its main ingredient is something thats derived from an onion and it doesnt have very good scar treatment properties. After having my baby I was desperate to try just about anything. This foul smelling good for nothing waste of money proved just how desperate I was. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I actually think this made my stretch marks look worse! I have not seen any progress and my stretch marks seem to become more visible than before! Waste of my money!!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to pay $40.00 for this but I am sooooo glad I did! I just had a baby 12 weeks ago and had light stretch marks around my belly button and some slight pink ones. I also had dark purple ones on my hips. I didn&#x27;t buy this till 4 weeks post partum....It has SIGNIFICANTLY reduced the appearance of them so far. My first bottle lasted me 5 weeks and I&#x27;m about to buy another. The ones on my belly look almost invisible now and the ones on my hips are way lighter. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will look like after 12 weeks. The smell truly is gross though, like flowery purfume and it&#x27;s very strong. I don&#x27;t care though, as the product itself is truly working and I&#x27;m very happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> I cant really say whether this product is effective or not because I can&#x27;t use it due to the terrible scent! I just had a baby and wanted to get rid of my stretch marks but I&#x27;m afraid the smell is too harsh for my baby. I might try using it again when I am done nursing and my baby is a little bit older. I wish mederma would make this unscented!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll note up front that I&#x27;m a guy and didn&#x27;t like the strong flowery scent of the product. In fact, I was allergic to the scent and ultimately gave it to a woman I know, who was also unable to use it because of the odor. May not be much market for sale to men, but it&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t consider racheting down the stink several notches. This would overpower any cologne, perfume, or deodorant. Who knows if it works, since I decided breathing was more important?</li>
    <li> I had a few stretch marks on my inner thighs (not from a pregnancy) that were red and white. I have used this product on and off for about a year now and I can honestly say that on this second go-around I have definitely noticed that they have reduced in size, are no longer red, and are definitely much smoother than they were. I just ordered more to keep using on the same area and also to start applying on some other problem areas.</li>
    <li> This worked for minor stretch marks after having my son. I just had a few near my belly button. I was shocked that it worked on more pronounced stretch marks when I had my daughter. I had many more with her on my belly and while they aren&#x27;t completely gone they are extremely diminished and I didn&#x27;t even use it as often as it says too.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve tried every product out there to conceal and remove my stretch marks from pregnancy. I&#x27;ve tried Cocoa Butter, Vitamin E oil, Bio oil, lotions, etc. and all have about the same effect: They don&#x27;t prevent stretch marks, they just take away the itching. I was reluctant to try this because it was much more expensive than the other products and I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work any better so why pay the extra money. I finally caved and tried it and it&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle. My previous stretch marks have faded significantly and it&#x27;s improved the texture making the skin nice and soft again. I am SO happy with this product. Although it hasn&#x27;t miraculously removed the stretch marks, it&#x27;s made a big improvement and I&#x27;ll be using this until I can afford to have them removed permanently.</li>
    <li> I did not see to much of an improvement when using this product</li>
    <li> I have horrible stretch marks from my pregnancy. They are on my sides and all around my belly button! I was so upset, until I saw the Mederma commercials. I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to believe commercials all the time, but I also saw this product on the Dr.OZ show and he stated that this creme works. I went out and spent the $40 on it and used it religiously! I honestly can say that yes, I did see results in the first few weeks. My stretch marks lightened up and became softer. I was getting very excited that they were actually going to go away. After about 5 weeks, there was no change in them for better or for worse. I used it the full 12 weeks, until the bottle was gone and my stretch marks are still there, and as ugly as ever. They make it seem like they will completely disappear. Like I said, they are lighter ... but my point of view - I should&#x27;ve saved my $40 because they are still there. Yes, they have lightened up a little bit, but they are still there haunting me! I don&#x27;t recommend this creme, th stretch marks are still very visible.</li>
    <li> Really dissapointed in this product. I wish there had been something in the description about the strong smell. I was looking forward to using this but it honestly is so strong smelling I havn&#x27;t used it more than once.</li>
    <li> After my first child, I had a few stretch marks and tried in vain to treat them with a few other topical products (including regular Mederma, but who can possibly afford to apply something that expensive to such a large area and so often?!).  After my second child, I had HUNDREDS of stretch marks, and decided to give this a try because I was really self-conscious about them.  I am SO pleasantly surprised with how well it works.  The marks aren&#x27;t completely gone, but the product did deliver in its promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stretch marks covered my entire belly and were scattered on my hips and upper thighs as well, and because I am very fair-skinned they were a very angry red.  Now they are much lighter, smoother, and less defined after three months of applying this lotion, and to be honest, I often forgot and didn&#x27;t apply it twice a day, every day.  Just for reference, one bottle lasted me just shy of a month, and I applied a generous amount to my entire belly (navel to pubic bone and out and around hips).  I would say I averaged about 10 applications per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if they will continue to improve with longer use, but I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle and find out.  I definitely recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough but I can already tell its making the texture of my stretch marks less noticeable. So I&#x27;m hoping the longer I use it, the stretch marks will fade. But out of most products that I have used in the past, this one is working the best for me so far.</li>
    <li> It states it may take up to 12 weeks to see results, right now I&#x27;m on week 5 and I can tell a difference. I had pretty bad stretch marks from having 2 kids. I definetly can tell they are becoming lighter and some are almost invisible. The ones that are taking longer are from my 4 year so they&#x27;re older stretch marks. The only bad thing I can say is I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle. Small bottle doesn&#x27;t last but about 4 weeks if you use it everyday, twice a day like product states</li>
    <li> Big improvement. I have stretch marks from being pregnant and after applying twice a day i noticed a big change in about two weeks! It takes forever to dry but its worth it</li>
    <li> I have a two year old and two year old stretch makrs covering my stomach.  This lotion is already improving them after about two weeks of use.  I do not think they will disappear, but they blend better and my skin looks less wrinkled when I move around.</li>
    <li> I have had three children (over the span of  6 years) and have a slew of stretch marks all around my middle stomach area as well as my hip area.  After only using the cream for two weeks, I&#x27;m already seeing improvement with my stretch marks.  The texture has definitely started to smooth out, and I have pretty deep stretch marks to begin with.  Additionally, the discoloration of the marks has started to fade as well.      I have also used StriVection in the past with no changes, even after finishing the entire bottle of cream.  Whereas with Mederma, I&#x27;ve seen results with just a couple weeks of use.  I&#x27;m waiting to see what the final results will be after a couple more months (hence the 4 starts) but so far, I&#x27;m definitely a believer of this cream.   Yes, the cream does have a peculiar scent but it&#x27;s not entirely unpleasant, just takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> So I thought this would work for me since many said it worked for old stretch marks, well, it does Not. It smells good &amp; that&#x27;s all the good that comes out of this bottle. Nothing else.</li>
    <li> Loving this, after a week, I&#x27;m already noticing some changes in my stretch marks. Looking forward to using it longer and watching them fade. Also, arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I used this diligently, putting up with the weird smell and nasty looks from my boyfriend. I cannot tell one single bit of difference in my stretch marks. To be fair, the active ingredient is, evidentally, scientifically proven to reduce scaring and stretch marks. I have fair skin that scars easily, which is probably why I did not see any results. If you also scar easily, I&#x27;d guess you will see as little progress as I did n</li>
    <li> This is a great product. After using this for about 3 weeks I noticed a change in my stretch marks. My marks have faded. Great!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for newer stretch marks rather than older ones it will fade the older ones but you might not see much change in apperence  with older marks</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time but the bottle was half empty. It only lasted a week. I would not recommend the buy! Purchase the item in stores. It&#x27;s only going to be a few dollars more but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It does work!! Like a week but either way it does work! Trust me I&#x27;ve use baby oil and the butter coconut those didn&#x27;t work but this cream I honestly do recommend!</li>
    <li> On my second box and my stretch marks look SO much better.  Started this within a month of having my son.</li>
    <li> I began using this product 8 days ago and I am shocked at the results so far. My stretch marks are already far less visible and the skin is much smoother.  I have been using on my stomach twice a day as directed and rubbing in a circular motion. I cannot believe I can already tell the difference.  My stretch marks are 14 months old and had already faded to white and my skin tone is fair but tans easily. Definitely try this product it was totally worth the high price for me even if nothing else happens for next 11 weeks of use!</li>
    <li> I started using this during the second trimester of pregnancy. I already had numerous old, white stretch marks from puberty. While I did not develop any new stretch marks during pregnancy, Mederma did not noticeably change the appearance of my old stretch marks, so I am somewhat disappointed. I know the product information states that it does not work as well on old stretch marks, but it did not work at *all* on them. I applied the product as directed. I do think it might have helped to prevent me from developing new stretch marks during pregnancy, and I would use it during future pregnancies and would probably recommend it to friends who are worried about developing stretch marks during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> The sooner you use it the better!</li>
    <li> Well I haven&#x27;t seen too much of a change yet, but I am still hoping and using Mederma whenever I remember to. I think that I should use it twice a day to see a change faster</li>
    <li> Good, good price, the smell is fine, but don&#x27;t Loooove it, is good. A little to flowery and strong for me. But it is fine anyways</li>
    <li> I followed the directions on the bottle in terms of applying it twice daily but after using it for a few weeks it didn&#x27;t do me any good. I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my stretch marks and even though I had my stretch marks for a long time I thought I was going to see some improvement-but not. My skin is a little bit smoother that&#x27;s it.  I will not reorder this stretch mark cream I will try another one even though the price on this one is decent.  It doesn&#x27;t work so it is a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since my first 3 month pregnant . Now I am 7 months already,  my skin looks pretty good has no stretch marks and so soft(4 tubes overall until now) I think if you start to use it sooner since you know that you get pregnant maybe you will get a better result.  I will post the review again  if it really works until I get bigger (9 months).</li>
    <li> I have used the cream for a month and, believe me, I had very low expectations.  I have two main problem areas I decided to tackle first.  I have used the product for one month and even though my stretch marks are many, many years old, I can notice a visible improvement in their appearancce.  I am so happy!  Worth every penny!  On my way to buying the second container!  Thanks, Mederma!</li>
    <li> Tried this for 4wks and no subtle changes. I am now about 8 wks in and still no change in appearance. I&#x27;m not sure if any stretch mark therapy actually works. I am going to finish it off just to finish the lotion. :(</li>
    <li> I bought the cream for the cosmetic indication, using for my daughter because she has stretch marks on the body. With just a box with the product we have noted the effectiveness of it. Indeed the effect is proven, with continued use of the marks actually disappear. Then I bought two more boxes to continue her treatment. Product of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen a lot of results</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how a little goes a long way. I just got it yesterday soo idk if its working yet but i can already tell its better than palmers cream for stretch marks. I feel this cream working more than other i have tried ty for a nice product &#x3D;3.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I don&#x27;t notice a difference in my stretch marks.  I do however notice a difference in the feel of my skin.  I love the way this makes my skin feel.  It feels younger and smoother.  My husband has even commented on how nice my skin feels now.  I will continue using it and if I notice a change in the marks, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen a change in my stretch marks but my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a full month now and I haven&#x27;t seen any results. I read the reviews before purchasing and they were mostly favorable so I was expecting great things. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed but I am still using it religiously (as instructed) and hoping for results. The product claims that you will notice results in 4 weeks but for optimal results, 12 weeks so I&#x27;m hoping for the best. I&#x27;m not sure if this matters but my stretch marks are the silver kind not the reddish/purple kind.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks with my first child but the second left a road map around my belly button. I figured I had nothing to lose in trying this product. I admit that I haven&#x27;t been as good about doing it morning and night like it says you should but I&#x27;ve still seen really good results. They are much lighter and also firmer. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to lighten their stretch marks. I mean I doubt they will ever fully go away but at least now I can look at my stomach and not just see stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for the recommended 12 weeks it says on the instructions yet but for the first two weeks that I have been using it my skin has felt much smoother showing good signs of continued results.  I&#x27;ll keep everyone updates as conditions improve (hopefully) .</li>
    <li> Pros:  Seems to be working (I am currently pregnant)  I actually enjoy the floral smell  My skin feels smoother  Stretch marks appear less red    Cons:  Doesn&#x27;t work as drastically as I would like  Probably have to wait until not pregnant anymore to see true results  Price is high</li>
    <li> Ok but not perfectly.  Recommends buying 3 bottles for full treatment.  I used one bottle and my stretch marks are lesser but not totally gone.  Terrible scent.</li>
    <li> Wishful thinking! I really had hoped this would help but i honestly feel it did nothing for me. Maybe for others but not for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two years now and slowly but surely my stretch marks are disappearing. Mine were very old and have had them since I was young so this product does work but this takes time I mean it&#x27;s new skin healing so this is not something that will happen over a weeks time. Be patient</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for 2 months now and seems like it is working.  The stretch marks are still there, but very light.  I think if I continue using it, hopefully it will fade away or less visible.  Before using it, the stretch marks were dark and red.  Now after 2 months, it&#x27;s just very light.  Also it makes my skin feel very smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason why I gave it a 4 stars is due to the pricing.  It can be quite expensive especially if you want to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> been using it for about a month now and i can see improvement, they&#x27;re still visible but less than before which is good :) will keep buying this!</li>
    <li> I tried everything on the market - oils and cocoa butter of different brands, but then I found this. It&#x27;s amazing!! Nothing else made even the slightest difference in my stretch marks, but Mederma Stretch Marks Therapy nearly restored my skin to what it looked like before I got pregnant. For my first pregnancy I didn&#x27;t find it until after I gave birth. My stomach, hips and behind looked like a purple zebra. 12 weeks later and those stretch marks were nearly invisible. If I could, I&#x27;d buy it for every one of my pregnant friends as a maternity gift!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 kids and am fortunate to only have minimal stretch marks.  I tried this product on stretch marks which were 18 months old.  I wish I had tried it sooner!  After 12 weeks of use, I have seen improvement.  While the stretch marks are not completely gone, they have faded considerably and my skin is more smooth.  I may have had more success than others because my stomach was not covered - I only had a small patch of stretch marks leftover from being pregnant.  Others commented on the smell; however, I did not find it offensive.  I used this product faithfully twice per day for 12 weeks and I did see noticeable results!</li>
    <li> Have already seen results before the 4 week mark! Already purchased my second tube.</li>
    <li> lo the smell and it seems to be working! i feel my tummy better&lt;br /&gt;but it is not the same as the picture. mine is green</li>
    <li> It is not that effective. I applied it for a long time and it did not really do that much for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this creme have been using twice a day and its been working great on my stomach...</li>
    <li> I used it for couple of months now it is not magical cream but is the best cream I already used&lt;br /&gt;I have some red stretch marks around my waste since my first pregnancy and some white in my tummy and thighs&lt;br /&gt;MEDERMA  cream make the red smaller and the scars became smoother and even the white ones they didn&#x27;t disappear completely&lt;br /&gt;but they are so much smoother and they are not noticeable&lt;br /&gt;am pregnant now with my second baby and I&#x27;m planing to continue using MEDERAM  cream all through my pregnancy&lt;br /&gt;and I recommend it for any time type of stretch marks .</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is for stretch marks but I use it on my face.</li>
    <li> i have use mederma stretch mark therapy almost a year now but i have not seen a good changes.i have stretch marks all over my body due to a weight gain pills i took.can anybody show me a good stretch marks cream?i have spent almost 800 dollars on mederma stretch mark cream but did not see changes.what is the different between MEDERMA STRETCH MARK THERAPY AND MEDERMA  STRETCH MARK THERAPY ADVANCED CREAM FORMULA????</li>
    <li> I am a first time mom, 5 1/2 months into my pregnancy and started at a pre-pregnancy weight of 95 lbs &amp; height of only 4&#x27;10\\&quot; so my skin is definitely getting its workout. I use this product 2-3x a day and no signs of stretch marks yet at all! Keeps my skin soft and moisturized for an extremely long time after applying. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Works as described if you keep your pregnancy weight again to minimum. Don&#x27;t expect to gain 80 lbs and not have stretch marks. That&#x27;s called magic.</li>
    <li> Blends stretch marks very well! Prior to mederma, I was considering laser treatment. (Pregnancy stretch marks on the belly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laser no longer needed. It takes a couple weeks to seem improvement, but it does work.</li>
    <li> The large box lasts only a couple of weeks so they try to get you to buy more so that you can experience their guarantee. I saw very minimal changes in my fresh stretch marks (still red). I used It Works Body Wrap and it drastically helped, way more then this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have used this product up to three times a day for about 3 weeks.  I honestly see no difference yet but I hope to see some improvements eventually.  My biggest issue is I already had too buy another bottle.  I only rub it on my breasts belly and sides. It goes quick and for the amount of money I wish there was more.</li>
    <li> No results what-so-ever.</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME cream and REALLY WORKS! I purchased it after my baby was born to get rid of the pregnancy stretch marks and it proved quite effective. I could see the effects as early as 10 days into using it. Just be regular with it and it can work miracles!</li>
    <li> ive bought 4 of these already. i applied twice a day as recommended for a period of 7 months and didn&#x27;t notice results whatsoever. so i gave up. product did arrive on time and for half the price they sell in stores this item is a steal. in addition the stretch marks i was aiming to get rid off weren&#x27;t just new, ones they were old and some new.</li>
    <li> Have not seen results yet been a month..but  waiting for the end of month 3 to see the results. Lets see</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and i have seen a difference but nothing major like ohhh my skin is perect i still has scars but they are not as red as before and i was really impressed by that alot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a tiny improvement but I had to buy three bottles and I don&#x27;t think its worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I really did not notice a huge difference in my stretch marks, but I guess a little bit of improvement is better than none.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand the difference between these two</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor recommended.</li>
    <li> This product came in a timely manner. However, I must say that this product takes a long time to show improvement on the skin.  I gave up. But it did say that you&#x27;d see improvements in 4 months and a huge improvement in 12.</li>
    <li> I have used it for several weeks...Seems it works...I dont mind the smell.But think need to massage it a bit harder..</li>
    <li> I have a 7 week old baby, and have been using this product for about 4 weeks now.  Ive seen a significant improvement in the color and texture of the stretch marks I got from pregnancy. I would definetely recommend this product to a friend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month, and I still don&#x27;t see any progress/results that you are suppose to get when using this product. I bought two containers of the Stretch Marks Therapy thinking that it would work, since I have used a Mederma product for scarring and that completely worked. Unfortunately, I missed my deadline to return this product and get a refund. I advise anyone who wants to use this product and isn&#x27;t sure about it&#x27;s performance, but has used other products from this same company, to just buy a smaller package because I believe that every person&#x27;s body is different and reacts to many things in different ways; therefore, if it worked for others, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it will work for you.</li>
    <li> I see no results after 2 bottles</li>
    <li> I already have horrendous stretch marks from baby #1.  They&#x27;re old and faded now, but I&#x27;m hoping to prevent more with baby #2.  So while I can&#x27;t speak on how well this stuff fades stretch marks, or prevents them (yet), I can say that after only a few weeks of using it my skin is definitely smoother!  There used to be craters from the old stretch marks and there aren&#x27;t anymore!  That itself is a miracle.  I wish I had this stuff 7 years ago and maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten any stretch marks at all.  I had tried to prevent them with bio oil and the palmers cocoa butter stuff.  Didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m certain that if there was a cream that would prevent them it would be this one.</li>
    <li> This saved my life! I had a lot of stretch marks from my pregnancy, they all went away! You can&#x27;t even see them anymore. Very happy with this !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been four months since I had my baby, and I believe I have only been using this product for two. My stretch marks are mostly white now, except for the really bad ones which are now light red instead of dark purple. I only use the product one time a day when I get out of the shower, so I imagine the results would have doubled by now if I used it like I was supposed to. This stuff is great!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been using it for over 12 weeks and I have noticed a big change in the appearance, feel, and color of my stretch marks after pregnancy.</li>
    <li> This actually works. Not in a I get paid to say it does sort of way. Like I&#x27;m a real mom with real post partum stretch marks and after two bottles my stretch marks are almost gone. I expect to have to buy a third because the bottle lasts a month and the instructions say use for 3 months. So glad I took a chance with this one. Although they offer a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> This was a good ism it is actually make my stretch marks minimize.  I love the improvement.  You definitely give ita try.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
    <li> As always there&#x27;s not miracle products but this still works very well , obviusly a do some  exercise and try to led a balanced diet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve seen a good improve of my strech marks and general skin appearance...i&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
    <li> This cream works! I gained 60 pounds while pregnant with my first child, and then had a another baby 2 years later adding MORE stretch marks to my stomach. I have noticed they aren&#x27;t as dark or as deep. They are disappearing before my eyes. I have been using this product everyday- twice a day, morning &amp; night. I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle and just put myself on the auto ship. It does say you do see results within 4 weeks and dramatic results in 12 weeks. I&#x27;m excited to see my stomach in 2 more months.</li>
    <li> I bought this to combat stretch marks on my rear end and I there is a drastic improvement. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Still using it..hoping my results get better than they are right now. Been using it consistently for a month now post baby and really haven&#x27;t seen much improvement.</li>
    <li> This stuff definitely helps my stretchmarks go away! if nothing else they get much much lighter to the point were i am no longer embarrassed of them :)</li>
    <li> Apply consistently for best results twice daily for at least 12 weeks. Usually affects best when applied after shower and before bedtime.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my sister, and I think it would be good.  i think it would be good! oh</li>
    <li> When I was 32 weeks pregnant with my twins, I noticed the first angry red line climbing up the side of my torso. Within a week it seemed dozens of them had sprung up on the underside of my belly. I was HORRIFIED! And so it was that one year ago, I sat exactly where you are today--looking through the reviews for this very product right here on Amazon. (Except I read only the positive ones and ignored the not-so-positive ones, determined to cling to any shred of hope that I could see these \\&quot;hideous\\&quot; scars go away.) The thing is, before and during my pregnancy, stretch marks were my worst nightmare. I didn&#x27;t worry about what breastfeeding would do to my breasts, wasn&#x27;t concerned about the weight gain, didn&#x27;t mind all the other weird changes to my body... but stretchmarks were just flat-out unacceptable. Imagine my shock and desperation when the unthinkable happened to ME and my previously-picturesque, unblemished belly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after confirming all I wanted to hear about this product&#x27;s efficacy, I placed my order and immediately began applying the lotion when it arrived, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. I went through one tube and then gave birth to my twin babies. Then onto a second and third tube. Now, 12 months after the first application, there are still noticeable red stretch marks on my sides, though they aren&#x27;t as bright, and the marks on my lower abdomen have faded to a silvery version of my regular skin tone. It seems like the grooves of the marks aren&#x27;t as deep, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s actually true or it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve gotten used to the way my skin feels now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have I noticed a difference in the appearance of my stretch marks? Yes! But my entire body&#x27;s appearance has changed since I first started using the product. I have no idea whether to attribute it to weight loss (back to pre-pregnancy weight with no diet or workouts y&#x27;all, just breastfeeding twins!), skin shrinkage, fading due to age of the marks, exfoliation and hydration routine, my own mind playing tricks on me, Mederma Stretch Marks Therapy, or some other factor I haven&#x27;t thought of. What I CAN tell you is that for many months, I was extremely unsatisfied with the results of my twice-daily Mederma habit. The stretch marks were still way too visible, the texture of my skin still way too far from smooth, my insecurities about my midsection WAY out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing I know for sure that worked to make my stretch marks look better was the sudden realization that... Wow, I am a truly beautiful woman! I know it sounds corny and maybe cliche, but it&#x27;s true for me. I&#x27;m not sure where/when/how I learned that stretch marks are \\&quot;ugly\\&quot; (maybe through the marketing campaigns by companies selling products designed to prevent or reduce them?). I definitely know that before I learned they were \\&quot;ugly\\&quot; and represented imperfection, I had seen them on other women, and it in no way diminished their beauty in my eyes. And yet I spent months berating myself and my skin over MY stretch marks, thinking and truly believing that they made me \\&quot;less\\&quot; of something. BOY, am I glad I&#x27;m done with THAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, the effectiveness of this product is questionable in my experience. Despite going through three tubes of the stuff, I remained pretty unhappy with the look of my skin until I learned to stop worrying and love the stretchies! If you&#x27;re still just interested in making those little suckers as imperceptible as possible, I guess buying this product might be worth a shot at gaining some peace of mind. The smell and/or stickiness never bothered me. You don&#x27;t really have anything to lose except for time and money, so if you have a little extra to spare in both of those departments... eh, might as well. At the very least, this lotion regimen will make you spend enough quality time with your stretch marks that you may eventually just come to accept them.</li>
    <li> This was an okay lotion. Decent scent. Behaves much like how you would expect this lotion to work. not sure how great it works..</li>
    <li> MY FRIEND HAD INFORMED ME ABOUT THIS ITEM SO THERE I ORDERED IT AND TRYED IT MYSELF IT WORKS MIRACLES !!! I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Not sure if I was past the point of no return for using this product or needed to give it another 3 weeks and buy more of it.  I felt that I found that it was reduced in some areas but I&#x27;ve decided that having a few marks here and there is fine, it&#x27;s motherhood.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and after 2 weeks I could visibly see the difference!! The lotion also has a very nice smell to it!</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product and I really like it so far. I like the scent (some people said the scent is too strong, but I disagree) and it leaves my skin feeling REALLY soft! I honestly think it changes the appearance of my stretch marks as I put it on... It seems to soften the look of the SM. I would purchase this product again, in store or online!</li>
    <li> I only tried it a few times because it smelled so terrible. It smells like onions and there are much better smelling and effective products.</li>
    <li> Only using this product a week and already seeing great results will continue to use this product, amazing scent as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m pregnant and it has and will be a total miracle!! Once this little guy comes.</li>
    <li> I used this product the last two weeks of my pregnancy just to prevent stretch marks, when i got it i used it at night after my shower and during the night i started feeling itchy near my belly button, the next morning i could tell there was a stretch mark forming. To my disgrace i kept using it and more stretch marks starting appearing i stopped using it and i actually used palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter along with baby oil no more stretch marks appeared! I regret using Mederma first. If you are pregnant i promise you that this product will not prevent stretch marks. After i gave birth three days after i used Mederma again i thought maybe now that the skin is not growing it will ATLEAST help my stretch marks fade. WRONG AGAIN.. i actually would use Mederma 2-3 times a day for four weeks and NEVER noticed any lightening or fading... my stretch marks are the same i would use a good amount on my buttocks, thighs, stomach and breasts and used up 3 bottles. I do not recommend this product to anyone seriously i believe there are other products that are cheaper and work better to prevent stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I used this after my baby. I had horrible stretch marks! I started using it right after and my stretch marks have faded quite a bit since using this. Most of them are hardly visible now. I know they fade anyways but I believe this has helped them even more.</li>
    <li> Good experience with seller but product did not work at all</li>
    <li> I used this one before this is a 2nd,  i feel like better on my skin but still see a stretch marks but j wil keep doing i hope will getting better and better</li>
    <li> made me break out in a rash.</li>
    <li> They were recommended by my dermatologist, and I used two of these so far, but haven&#x27;t seen a clear difference.</li>
    <li> I was desperate to get rid of all the stretch marks post baby.  I did quite a bit of research and decided that I would give the Mederma a try.  It took longer than described, but it did indeed work and I can barely see the stretch marks any more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for a couple of weeks now and it is actually helping my skin get smoother and firmer. My only concern is that since this is a product meant for long term treatment, I am foreseeing that I&#x27;ll use at least three of the 5.29 oz containers (its not that much cream per container). I don&#x27;t mind the time it takes, but I it will get expensive by the time I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product for 2 weeks. I notice a slight improvement. Mainly in the smoothness of my skin.  I used it on the hips and have experienced some pore clogging causeing tiny zits but I tend to have sensitive skin.  So if you have sensitive skin, use with caution.  Directions say to use a generous amount so the product goes fast and depending on the size of the area, it might not last the recommened 12 weeks of useage.  2 bottles should do it.    So far so good.      Pros:  The smell isnt bad like other creams.  It is not greasy, and non staining. Price is high for a cream but most other strech mark creams are way more expensive so I think the price is great for a product that actually works!</li>
    <li> The product came in as described.  Shipment was quick.  Would use seller again.</li>
    <li> I just started using this a week ago and can already see that my \\&quot;beauty marks\\&quot; are getting lighter. Mine was the deep dark kind. My skin also feels smoother where they are. I am now 6 weeks pregnant and am also using this to prevent along with bio oil. My family gets horrible stretch marks with babies so hopefully I can prevent them. If not, I know this will help reduce the appearance.</li>
    <li> Havent been using it long enough to see results but it seems like my marks are lightening up. Has kind of a funny smell to it, it kind of lingers.</li>
    <li> I couldnt tell if this was working until i looked at before and after pictures.  It did make a difference, but the difference is not as great as the advertisements they have.  Either way, i was content with even the slight lightening it did</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products for stretchmarks. this actually works! stock up on it!</li>
    <li> bought twice, I think no big difference</li>
    <li> Not sure it did much for me. The smell is really good though!</li>
    <li> I sure hope this stuff works for stretch marks. I didn&#x27;t use it while pregnant because I couldn&#x27;t find out on the mederme website if it was safe to use during pregnancy. It arrived on time in small packaging.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a slow process, but I think it&#x27;s working. I use it every morning, and it seems to help.  However, I&#x27;m also lifting weights, so who knows?</li>
    <li> I started using this product YESTERDAY along with urban skintations Shea butter unfragranced and a micro needle rolling pin, that I roll for a few minutes across my entire stomach. I gave birth in march to a 9 pound baby and needless to say my stomach stretched badly! I put the urban skintations on in the morning, I did the mederma and micro-needle rolling pin at night, I woke up this morning and most of my thick purple stretch marks changed to white, my skin feels a lot tighter and when i push it together it doesnt look as scrunched. I couldn&#x27;t be any more happy with the results of just one day of using the products. I was skeptical about buying them because they are expensive (not the rolling pin that&#x27;s pretty cheap) but my entire pregnancy I lubed up with everything I spent 100s of dollars on and nothin worked. very very pleased with this product more than satisfied</li>
    <li> I used this product and it don&#x27;t work! I would love to get my money back from this mess.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels when you put it on and there is no heavy smell, hope in 4 weeks I see a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been useing this product for about 3 weeks now, and I am already seeing an improvement!  When I first started useing it, I thought the smell of the cream was awful and overpowering, but now I&#x27;m so used to it I don&#x27;t even notice.  One bottle, on average is suppossed to last a month, but I&#x27;m very prone to stretch marks and have a lot so it&#x27;s only lasting me about 2 weeks.  So I&#x27;m going to have to buy 6 bottles instead of 3, and boy is that going to be pricey!  However, if I keep getting results like I have these past 3 weeks, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months now, and my stretch marks have in fact lightened, but I&#x27;m not sure if the cream is responsible for that since stretch marks fade naturally over time anyway. I just figured it was worth a shot especially for the price. I&#x27;d rather spend $40 to try and get rid of stretch marks then spend the money on painful laser treatments. This  cream has a strong floral scent to it. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I can see how it might bother other people. That&#x27;s why I only gave it four stars. It does keep my skin very moisturized, soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 1/2 weeks and well it didn&#x27;t make the stretch marks go away just lightened it :/</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream, even though I am still pregnant in my last 2 weeks.  I have already seen a difference just after a few days!  I use as directed in the AM &amp; PM.  I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and easy to apply.  Will continue to purchase throughout the 12 weeks for the directed use!</li>
    <li> It does what it says. It softens your skin. However, it doesn&#x27;t remove stretch marks completely, but It does smooth them out and makes you skin super soft. I really like this product</li>
    <li> Actuallu didn&#x27;t work for me yet I am using it on my arms which have stretch marks that have been there for about 7-10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I&#x27;m on my second bottle hoping to see results I don&#x27;t use as recommended but try to as much as possible but honestly applying 2x a day is almost impossible especially as a full time double major student.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of not taking care of my skin while I was pregnant and then after I had my daughter, I gained even more weight which led to some very unsightly stretch marks. I have been lost almost 50 pounds over the past 9 months thanks to an awesome personal trainer and a daily does of cla caps and raspberry ketones, [[ASIN:B007Y18CY4 Primaforce Max CLA 180 Softgels + Free 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder]]. I give credit to these supplements as being the only thing that actually get my cravings and appetite under control (oh yeah my cravings did not stop when I had my baby!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am just about at my weight pre-pregnancy, I still have the stretch marks to remind me that I let my weight get out of control. I have been using this cream for 2 months now, and no it is not a miracle cream that has magically erased my stretch marks, but it definitely has decreased the appearance of them. They are lighter and blend in better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to lose weight after pregnancy, you totally should be using this cream as you lose the weight, not after! And also get some type of supplement to help suppress your appetite, makes things so much easier (and less painful!).</li>
    <li> Let me first say: I can put up with a lot of smells, even strong ones, and the smell from this gets to me. Its really strong and unpleasent but I put up with it because of the rave reviews. Well no results. I Aactually have MORE stretch marks. I am not gaining or losing weight or doing anything but I am getting more stretch marks while using this product. No difference in my existing stretching marks either. They are still there and as bright red/purple and deep as ever. Some of them are growing. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to say merderma isn&#x27;t  a good product, its just not for my skin. I&#x27;m a african american and 8months pregnant, Ive been using it for about 4to6 wks and still no chance and I just knew it would work for me but I was wrong. Its actually made my stretch marks darker then what they were. So basically I&#x27;m not happy with this product . I guess its works on who it want to work on. So I&#x27;m goin to return my merderma and get my money back. There is this item that I hear its works very good and not expensive at all, its called ambi fade cream and I just bought a box today for $5.50 not much money at all.That would be a product you all can use, and its not just for stretch marks but for whatever you are trying to fade away. Good luck to you all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working for my light stretch marks located on my knees. I&#x27;m seeing results and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference over the past month. As for my deepest/darkest stretch marks located on the thigh and buttocks area? No! This product did the trick for infinitesimal duties but not the most hard-to-handle ones. It needs to be tweaked a bit. -Maybe something a little more advanced? By the way, it&#x27;s not even enough product to frequently use 2-3 times per day.</li>
    <li> I NEVER EVER WRITE REVIEWS AT ALL. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS 1-2x A DAY EVERYDAY FOR A MONTH AND I HAVE SAW MY STRETCH MARKS FADED SO MUCH AND THEY ARE SO MUCH SMOOTHER AND EVEN MY BF SAID THEY LOOK GOOD. I CAN JUST IMAGINE AND AN EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THEY WILL LOOK LIKE AFTER 12 WEEKS! 1 BOTTLE LASTS ABOUT A MONTH! WORTH IT &amp; FOR THE PRICE ITS VERY CHEAP FOR THE RESULTS! THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!!!! WILL WRITE ANOTHER REVIEW AFTER THE FULL 12 WEEKS</li>
    <li> I had a baby in the middle of May. I ordered 2 bottles because the price had dropped since last time I bought it. I have been using it twice a day for 2 months and my stretch marks are exactly the same as they were when I started.</li>
    <li> Works fine on stretch marks, but the fragrance is terrible. It is too strong. I would buy an unscented version of it if they have it because the product seems to improve my stretch marks, but I can only put it on at certain points in the day when my nose isn&#x27;t so sensitive.</li>
    <li> Really could help to defeat the stretch! It just works! And stick with it, get some patient, you will find the real change.</li>
    <li> As per the instructions (twice a day, every day for 12 weeks), I&#x27;ve been using Mederma Stretch Marks Therapy almost usually twice a day, and for about 3 weeks now. I&#x27;ve noticed an incredible improvement in the appearance and depth of my stretch marks. It seems to be working wonders! I would definitely recommend using this, since I&#x27;m only a fraction of a way through the treatment and I&#x27;m already noticing a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I dont know if this product trully works, because I think it&#x27;s crazy that I have to spend $30+ for this tiny bottle. I bought 3 and to be honest I didnt see any change so I didnt see the need to test a 4th one and waste my money...</li>
    <li> no improvement at all And I used  three tubes of this .it was a waste of money  I put it on twice a day once in the morning once at night no improvement I feel like I should get a refund . when I say no improvement I mean nothing at all</li>
    <li> Is excellent product, Thanks</li>
    <li> I tried this cream for the stretch marks and it doesn&#x27;t work.  I thought it would work a little but it sucked</li>
    <li> Works great. I saw significant changes within 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Got this quick! And heard good reviews! My third week and seems to be working great!! Keeping my results in pictures</li>
    <li> I used this for a month twice a day as directed.  It said you should see results in a month and I most certainly did not. Save your money, consider them beauty marks from your baby and learn to live with them.</li>
    <li> i used this product while i was pregnant to prevent getting any stretch marks but this didnt help at all i got them pretty bad and it made my skin extremely itchy save your money dont buy this product.    since then i have been using bio oil and my stretch marks are way less noticeable</li>
    <li> I am olive skin toned and had a few pale stretch marks on my breast and thighs, I have been using this cream for only a week  and I love it! I can already see a difference. My stretch marks seem to be blending in with my natural skin tone. Can&#x27;t wait to see the full results!:) Thank you Mederma!</li>
    <li> the product didn&#x27;t work. but received it in a timely manor and was the cheapest i could find, even in the stores.</li>
    <li> Worked to my expectations</li>
    <li> I like Mederma.  It helped alleviate some of my red stretchmarks after pregnancy.  It also makes your skin really soft which.  I think it works because its really hydrating your skin.  I would just be cautious about ordering from Amazon because they sent me an old product that had already been opened even though it said new.  I love Amazon, just cautious now.</li>
    <li> I started using Mederma Stretch Marks Therapy to get rid off 30 year old stretch marks that remained after tummy tuck.  I have very light skin and the marks where even whiter.  I noticed after a couple of weeks of using the cream that the stretch marks were getting dark but darker than my skin leaving brown lines where the marks were.  I stopped using it as the brown lines did not look better than what I had.  I hope the lines return to white as I had them before.</li>
    <li> It was wasn&#x27;t greasy or thick and actually did take away some marks, however some of the marks do return but they are much lighter (you can barely see them). I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It smells funny and hasn&#x27;t worked on me.  I&#x27;m naturally olive and my stretch marks are light.  I&#x27;ve also had them for years, so I am not sure if this product only works on new stretch marks.</li>
    <li> ok, Didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My belly keeps growing and just hope to not get any stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. I guess no products really work for stretch marks. The product is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t burn but I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has definitely made my stretch marks lighter, I just recently purchased my second bottle &amp; it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had stretch marks on my hips and butt for sixteen years.  They started with my growth spurt as an adolescent.  I&#x27;ve used countless products in the hope of finding the elusive cure.  I turned to Mederma because of the success rate of its scar removing gel.  I noticed, within three months of religious use, the skin around the marks appeared smoother so, though the stretch marks weren&#x27;t removed (no surprise there), their appearance was visibly improved.  However, upon discontinuing its use, I noticed, within a few weeks, I was back to square one.  This cream requires eternal use.  For the price, I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, but no noticeable effects after 10+ weeks.</li>
    <li> Perfect for expecting mom&#x27;s trying to keep stretch marks at bay!  I&#x27;m approaching 36 weeks have used this lotion since week 20 and so far so good...no stretch marks yet!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same thing As in stores just in the older bottle</li>
    <li> Since ive started using this product I have seen my marks fade a little, they were bright red omg and now they are darker and a little more of my complexion, I am going to recommend using this product, exercising, and wearing a waist trainer ( all together ) to start seeing results. I have been skeptical but this product is making me into a believer honestly.</li>
    <li> Nice product, just feel like of I pay $30.00 for something it should be enough to last a while. I don&#x27;t have many stretch marks but if I did, the lotion wouldn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> It might be making a difference.  I can&#x27;t tell if the fading is from the lotion or time itself, but I was suprised to find the same active ingredient in a baby lotion (J&amp;J Intense cream for babies) for a fraction of the price!  I&#x27;ll be switching over to the baby lotion going forward.  Same ingredient, lower price, and smells better.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a female friend who has had 3 kids. So i figured she was using something that works and not wasting her time or money. I had surgery on my shoulder and went from being active to being a couch potato...I literally had no choice. I weighed 200lbs but quickly got up to 245lbs!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yikes!!! And so i developed stretch marks on my legs and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Here is my experience with this product: it states to Improve appearance, Reduce discoloration, Smooth texture and Enhance softness.&lt;br /&gt;The stretch marks on my bottom are almost absolutely gone! It has greatly improved the appearance and discoloration of the stretch marks on my legs. I still have the marks on my legs but they have gotten so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Understand that every product works different for different people, and complexion might have something to do with it i dont know. But this product diffidently does what it says it will do, be patient and apply twice a day every day and you will see results! I will buy this again hands down, almost done with 1st bottle will order another one soon to keep working at improving the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> The original Maderma is better for removing scars. This seems to be more for the prevention of scars than the removal, as it goes on like lotion.  This did not remove the stretch marks caused from my stretchmark-filled twin pregnancy (13lbs of baby). The original Maderma in the tube worked better. It&#x27;s more expensive (by volume) but 2 large tubes removed most of my growth stretch marks I got in my 20&#x27;s, leaving my skin looking amazing.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing item but I have seen a great improvement on my stretch marks in just a few weeks....thanks mederma</li>
    <li> so far as I can tell, this stuff works. will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product but I haven&#x27;t notices any changes in my stretch marks. I plan on using this product until the bottle is done but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order another bottle</li>
    <li> I used this product on stretch marks. I have old and new stretch marks. I did not see the new red ones improve. And, I did not see any kind of difference on the older white ones I have. But my skin did feel remarkably softer. My biggest problem is that this was so expensive for absolutely no results. I went through about three tubes in a period of two months trying to get the effectiveness out of this product. I used it both night and day for way more than 2 months. That&#x27;s over a hundred bucks with no visble results. I did expect better because Mederma is well known as effective scar treatment. I would have been better off just using my money to buy hyaluronic acid. And, I would have also saved a great deal of money by just investing in regular lotion. I feel poorer but wiser. AND, I cannot in any good conscience recommend this product. It may work for some people, but it did absolutely nothing for me. I fail to see what else I could have done outside of following the instructions to make this work. Booo!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t i know it doesnt work that fast but after 2 months i wanted to see more results, it just barely clear the light marks... hope it do its job in the end</li>
    <li> we get it every other month and this is being used for the 2nd &amp;#34;season&amp;#34;, our newborn is due in a few months.</li>
    <li> We purchased 3 large tubes of Mederma and used it consistently twice a day, for several months on new stretch marks, with very little results.  That&#x27;s close to $90 with almost nothing to show for it.  We wanted to give it time to work, but we&#x27;re moving on to something else.  There was only very minimal lightening of a few of the stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**  We have since used Tamanu Oil and then Argan Oil.  We are much happier with either of these.  Swanson has a great Argan Oil Cream that is a bit easier to use than the oil, and it has worked quite well.  Sometimes it&#x27;s even buy one get one free.</li>
    <li> I would recommend the mederma scar cream. It worked a lot better. This stuff didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 7 weeks now, 6 weeks postpartum and see minimal results...but I&#x27;ll keep going for vanity&#x27; sakes</li>
    <li> The package and size is the same as the image shown . It smells great though. Still awaiting the results, I have been using it now for 3 weeks</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002ZG94UY Mederma Stretch Marks Therapy, 5.29 Oz Box]]  I&#x27;ve used this close to 2 weeks now, and these are my observations. My stretch marks got a bit itchy the first few days of use, and the colors changed from dark brown to red  not sure if these are good signs yet, just did 2 out of the recommended 12 weeks) lets see how it goes. BTW,I&#x27;m what you would call very light-skinned AFAM, so my dark-colored stretch marks were pretty obvious. Then again my favorite part was how soft the cream made my hands. I&#x27;ve had these embarrasing calluses on my fingers that no hand cream had managed to soften, mederma is doing that for me. My hands are now so smooth, I could barely feel them. I&#x27;m so impressed that I&#x27;ve placed an order for a new bottle. Stretch marks, hand cream, foot cream, all in one. It&#x27;s my body cream for the next 10 weeks.  Will update this review as soon as I see any new changes, good or bad(hope not)!  UPDATE: 8 weeks later, the effect has worn off,lasted barely one month. No new changes, skin dried out. Will try for one more month, after which if nothing happens, will stick with basic skin oil. Goodluck!</li>
    <li> I bought this item at target hoping my stretch marks would go at least be less visible. I did not see any results! I put it on as the instructions said, I did exercise and drank water everyday! Still I saw no difference. Its a waste of money.. DONT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product. Ive used the scar treatment line by mederma and it works wonderfully so I thought i wasa going to have the same results with this product.I came onto this site and read all of the positive and negative reviews and decided to give it a try and see how it worked for me personally. Im going to have to agree with the negative reviews for this one. I used the cream as directed for about 8 weeks and I saw absolutely no improvement in the appearance of my stretch marks. Ill admit i think it MAY, and i mean MAY, have smoothed the texture out a little bit. But other than that nothing. Im not sure if it only works for specific skin types or if the other reviews were just really untruthful or what. But I do know that I used this product correctly and relentlessly for a long time and saw absolutely no improvement.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. I think time helped more than anything. Basically just a lotion. Smells nice but has parabens.</li>
    <li> In have been using it for 4 yrs now and so far I&#x27;m in love has definitely change the appearance on my stretch marks!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my stretch marks I did try it works stretch mark cream and helped a lot</li>
    <li> The packing could&#x27;ve been a bit better. But over all its great!</li>
    <li> Did not work. I am an adult male with marks on the biceps and sides. It gave me a bad rash after a few days of using it so i had to stop using it entirely. Dont buy it online and waste your money like i did. Go see a doctor if your considering a legit cream like this cuz it DOES NOT work for everyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s interesting, because if you check the box it says it takes about 6 months or more to work. Strangely, this is about as long as it would take for stretch-marks to heal and fade on their own. I  started using this for weightlifting/bodybuilding stretchmarks and after months and months of dutifully applying it, I don&#x27;t think it had any real effect.</li>
    <li> Good product been using for a month and l already see positive results I was surprised it came in a realy nice package</li>
    <li> According to my wife, the lotion helps with her tummy as our baby grows.  She said previously, her skin itched a lot as it stretched with the pregnancy.  With Mederma, her skin has become elastic and adjusts well.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Same size as big tube at target for a lot less.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m pretty slim and petite (5&#x27;4&#x27;&#x27;, 120 lbs), I have horizontal stretch marks on my rear end that have always embarrassed me during the summertime when I wear a swimsuit. I used this product over the fall &amp; winter time in preparation for the Summer and was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed from a few other reviews that people think this works only on a new stretch marks, this was NOT the case for me. I&#x27;ve had stretch marks from when I was young and now as a 34 year old, I finally bought a bottle of this product to use and I was pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting that in 2-3 weeks that years of stretch marks would be gone but after using a full bottle, my marks looked like they were blurred and not as deep. In addition to that, they shrunk in how wide they were. Fortunately my stretch marks never turned dark after all these years but I do believe the Mederma helped to shrink them overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the smell of the cream, which smelled clean and floral. The cream is white and absorbed as quickly as any other body lotion I&#x27;ve used. Each evening I would take time to massage this in and I also used a micro roller with it. Considering I spent about $30 on this treatment regime, I was happy with the results rather than spending thousands on laser treatments or anything else. Overall its not a miracle product but it definitely helped me and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> so, this is the miracle cream which cures all stretch marks huh? Didnt work amazingly for me. It was lacking. I did like the smooth feel but there was no vanishing. I didnt see the amazing results it led me to believe. It helped a bit I would guess, but time causes scars and stretch marks to fade as well so its hard to give this all the credit. For an infomercial type of thing it gets a 3. because it didnt do much but it definitely was not a scam like so many are.</li>
    <li> After having a baby.. most of us get stretch marks in the belly, mine were not that bad not that good but I decided to try this for all the good reviews.. after 2 months of use, I noticed they still look pretty obvious but the redness faded. and generally my belly looked better. Yes I would recommend it.. just don&#x27;t expect any miracle.</li>
    <li> I had my first kid about 9 months ago and got stretch marks all across my stomach. I thought they would never go away because they are so dark. Well after 1 month of using this product i see a great improvement! The bottle says use at night and in the morning  but sometimes i forget at night and i&#x27;m still seeing results! I will def order another bottle</li>
    <li> switching from regular btle to zippy style one it&#x27;s not bad as long my baby like it&lt;br /&gt;the only bad part is if the btle is put to much ups and down the sucking is noisy</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;new\\&quot; Mederma product I ordered did not arrive in a box, as the product is originally packaged. It did not have original plastic seal over flip cap, but was crudely taped closed.  This is not a new product, and I wouldn&#x27;t apply an open skin care product shipped from Puerto Rico to my body...went in the trash.</li>
    <li> Nice texture but smell is not great.  It&#x27;s highly expensive for something that functions just as well as another good lotion (think of Gold Bond, Lubriderm, Eucerin).  It&#x27;s silkier than those other lotions mentioned but it definitely did not do anything more for my stretch marks than any other lotion. I tried them all.  It&#x27;s just what it is.  But still important to use a good lotion on the stretch marks-- I&#x27;m thinking it could&#x27;ve helped at least it from getting much worse, but any other lotion/body oil might save you the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mederma for about 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any noticeable changes yet I am waiting until I finish the entire bottle to determine how it works, I&#x27;ve also skipped a night or two so I will put it into my routine better and I&#x27;m sure I will have better results</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I have stretch marks from having my twins 6 months ago. I used this religiously but they aren&#x27;t any better at all :(</li>
    <li> ME: Age 25&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN: Very pale; scars and burns easily&lt;br /&gt;MY STRETCH MARKS: 15-18 years old, on my inner thighs, left over from a massive growth spurt. They are (were!) silvery-purple, and sunk into my skin about an eighth of an inch. Their appearance and texture made it VERY easy to imagine my muscles and bones growing and my &amp;#34;skin suit&amp;#34; literally tearing to keep up.&lt;br /&gt;MY RESULTS: After THREE DAYS of using this product 2x a day, the surface of my skin is COMPLETELY SMOOTH! Any hint of purple is totally gone. I&#x27;m overjoyed and will update this review after 4 and 12 weeks have elapsed. (&amp;#60;&amp;#60; Mederma claims you will start to see results after 4 weeks; optimal results after 12 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I poured over these reviews and many online articles about Mederma Stretch Mark Removal Cream before I made my purchase. I was hopeful, but hesitant because some folks seemed to really not be getting results. After my transformative experience, I can&#x27;t help but feel that some must not be following the directions to a T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your best possible results:&lt;br /&gt;1. Exfoliate your skin. Not only will this prepare your skin to receive the product, but it will stimulate blood circulation to the area so your skin gets the vital oxygen and nutrients it needs to rebuild itself. I simply use a regular loofa with a moisturizing body wash to gently scrub each affected area in small circles for about 45 seconds while I&#x27;m in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply Mederma correctly. I use about a dime-sized drop (for 7 x 4 inches of skin) and massage it slowly into my skin, moving in small circles. I do so twice a day: once in the morning, after I shower; and once in the evening, before bed. I make sure to let the product dry completely before putting on clothes or slipping between the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;3. Keep your skin hydrated. Apply lotion (lotions infused with aloe and Vitamin E will help restore elasticity and tighten skin) and drink enough water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND THAT&#x27;S IT! If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product, I urge you to give it a try. The change to the surface of my skin and the visibility of my stretch marks is incredible. One final selling point:This Amazon price ($27 at the time of my purchase) is 30% cheaper than what I found in stores. Purchasing from Amazon was even cheaper than a local Group on deal (including shipping).f you&#x27;re on the fence about this product, I urge you to give it a try.

    <li> scars are scars so they are permanent, but this has helped maybe just a little! or is that my wishful thinking</li>
    <li> I used this product like it states but nothing changed not even a little bit. Not worth the money spent....</li>
    <li> The hype about it was what had me try it. It has however, not really improve my stretch marks. I would have to go get cocoa butter from palmers.</li>
    <li> I bought this at 7 months postpartum to try and help the stretch marks on the front of my stomach fade faster. I used it exactly as directed - massaged in a circular motion, 2x per day, for 12 weeks. It took about 1.5 bottles. I am happy to report my stretch marks faded quite a bit! They had hardly faded at all up until I started using Mederma, so I think the cream really did speed things along. Obviously the marks are still there, but they are very light, and I feel like I won&#x27;t die of embarrassment if people happen to see my stomach. Photo comparison below.  Top picture was the day I started, bottom picture was at week 12.</li>
    <li> Was surprised how well this worked. Was originally skeptical at first. One order of this surely isn&#x27;t enough. Def coming back for more.</li>
    <li> i realize stretch marks are par for the coarse with having kids, i have been using this product for a couple months and have found a slight change in my skin appearance. not the results i was hoping for. but id recomend any ways</li>
    <li> My stretch marks have visable reduced woth daily use over the course of the last two months. Best purchase ever.</li>
    <li> seen results from use</li>
    <li> Attempted to use this product for stretch mark prevention during pregnancy, but discontinued use due to its incredibly strong scent and the residue left behind after application. The lotion would come off in little flakes after it dried. For the money, I was incredibly disappointed. I used Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee lotion instead with excellent results!</li>
    <li> Takes a WHOLE LOT to get a very small result. Liked ordering here because it was so much cheaper than in store. For stretch mark creams I guess pretty good. I&#x27;ve tried others (ranging from $8 to $80 per tube with different brands) and have been most satisfied with this one. Started using it while I was still pregnant. With a sensitivity to smells this was not my favorite. Had an odd odor before application. But isn&#x27;t strong once you apply it and can&#x27;t smell it on you.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I was a bit skeptical to try it out at first, however, I&#x27;m glad I did.  After the first 3 weeks of using the stretch marks on my breasts got significantly lighter.  Now about a month and a half later, those on my legs are getting lighter.  At first the scent was a little much for me (it&#x27;s not a bad smell, but very strong), but after continued use, I don&#x27;t even smell it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to Mederma I used Palmer&#x27;s products and they did nothing for me except keep my skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that you run through the tubes very quickly.  For me that&#x27;s not a big deal since I&#x27;m seeing such great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking of getting it, I&#x27;d say try it out for a month and see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> I bought the mederma streach mark therapy cream about 3 weeks ago and it Works!! I gained alot of weight due to strees ect, and summer was coming up So I needed help with streach marks on my legs.. I would put the mederma cream on in the mornig when I woke up and about every 4 hours I would put some more on. I also bought Palmers cocoa butter cream concentrated and would put that on once a day... and know my streach marks r less notisable...It worked for me I mean it wont compleatly take away the marks but it does help alot.. I would recomend the mederma streach mark cream u wont be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> So far so good - it&#x27;s working after only 3 weeks and I am seeing a slight fase of the marks. I haven&#x27;t seen skin texture changes yet.</li>
    <li> My wife used this after the birth of our first child. She must like it because she did buy it again.</li>
    <li> For 32 dollars it was over priced and didn&#x27;t fulfill its job :( highly disappointed</li>
    <li> I notice a difference in 2 weeks. Was not expecting much but then after I started to use it I was very happy with the product</li>
    <li> I bought two boxes and I still see my beauty marks. I applied them daily over a period of 3 months and no change. It was a good try and not something I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I see change in my stretch mark but I doubt if they will go away I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough yet but they are looking different</li>
    <li> Mederma Stretch Marks Therapy is designed to be applied twice daily for twelve weeks to fresh stretch marks. You apply it in a circular motion until it is absorbed. You can even get text reminders from Mederma if you find you are having trouble remembering to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I developed three one inch stretch marks on my stomach during my second pregnancy. I am extremely fair skinned and the stretch marks were jagged and of a medium pink hue that really stood out. I have applied the lotion twice daily for a few weeks now, and my stretch marks are already a very faint pink color that almost blends in with my skin. I also want to add that my skin tone where the stretch marks are is very much improved and has lost the bizarre wrinkled appearance that you acquire with stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mederma has a thick creamy consistency that is absorbed readily by skin. It has no greasiness and I have not noticed it staining my clothing in any manner. The fragrance is another matter though. This formula has a strong floral fragrance. It dissipates fairly well during daytime hours, but if I apply it close to bedtime, the fragrance really intensifies while I sleep under bed linens. During warm weather it can be insufferable. However, I&#x27;m willing to give any product that does such a great job improving my skin so drastically a full five stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After three months of solid use, my stretch marks were negligible. I think stretch marks and their final appearance have so much to do with genetics and skin properties, but I do believe that the lotion really helped their final appearance.</li>
    <li> I havent seen the results I expected. The stretch marks havent lightened up much.. The product smells pretty good though.</li>
    <li> Va por buen camino, dice 2 meses de uso para ver efectos, ahora va un mes y ya se comienzan a notar los primeros efectos positivos</li>
    <li> I never actually used this product so I can&#x27;t review it..I&#x27;ve heard great things about it though! I was happy to be able to order it online instead of having to deal with the embarrassment of going in the store to get it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this project for less than 2 months and have already noticed results. Not only have my stretch marks faded but the texture of them is also improving!</li>
    <li> This product is somewhat effective in reducing stretch marks (in my case, bodybuilding); however, it is not as great as the hype makes it.</li>
    <li> After about a month I can now see my stretch marks slowly fading, Mederma works great! I would definitely recommend it to anyone with new stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40 weeks pregnant and I&#x27;ve been using this lotion since my early pregnancy. So far no stretch marks!!</li>
    <li> This product got such great reviews I decided to try it. I am now 38 weeks pregnant but did research early on so as to try and get a jump on preventing or limiting my stretch marks as I am a small girl. I have been using cocoa butter and another product my husband got me for Christmas. A few weeks ago I decided to start up with the mederma since I&#x27;m getting bigger every day and it got the best reviews. Unfortunately I won&#x27;t ever know how well it works as it gave me a terrible rash and made me itch like crazy. To make sure of what it was I stopped using everything until the rash was gone. Then used it before bed the other night. Woke up with a bad red rash and crazy itching. I do have pretty sensitive skin ie. to laundry detergents and face creams so I caution others with similar sensitivities that you may have a reaction to this product.</li>
    <li> I usually gain and lose weight a lot so I started getting white stretch marks on my breast and I heard there&#x27;s no possible way to get rid of them but laser but then I came across this and was pretty unsure about getting it because of the other ratings but I did anyways and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this worked very well for the price.</li>
    <li> After carrying 5 children, I really gave up all hope on ever seeing my \\&quot;real\\&quot; body again. My youngest is now 9 so I really didn&#x27;t think this product would work on stretch marks that are almost a decade old. To my surprise, after only a week of using maderma stretch marks therapy, I really do see a drastic improvement already! My &#x27;road map lines&#x27; have lightened up so much and some are even so light that you can&#x27;t see them unless you&#x27;re up close and personal lol. I recommend this product to every mom out there... at least give it a try because I think you just might be surprised like me. Its truly a &#x27;bottled miracle&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Angela P. Cin, Oh</li>
    <li> I purchased two 5.29 oz stretch mark creme. The label recommended three months before results are visible results can be seen however, my two bottles didn&#x27;t even last 5 weeks which was very frustrating since that meant I had to spend quite a lot to actually see any results. The creme though goes on very smooth with a nice scent.</li>
    <li> After the birth of my first baby I was left with very deep, red, wide stretch marks on my tummy. Worried they wouldnt go away on their own, I bought Mederma Stretch Mark Therapy and have been using it now for about three weeks. I really do see a difference. The color has certainly lightened and the depth seems to have reduced as well. My marks are still visible- not sure they will ever go away- but i think they will continue to improve with more use. I put it on as directed, morning and night. I dont have to use much, since my marks are generalized in one section of my tummy so i think this bottle will last a long time. I may even buy more when it&#x27;s gone, if the marks continue to improve at this rate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream continuously for about 4 months, about a month longer than the suggested period for optimal results, and am very happy with my results. My stretch marks appear on the insides of my arms, inner-thighs, hips, and buttocks. They are years old and fully-set in a creamy color. The color disparity between the scars and my skin tone is definitely more even but still noticeable, especially in certain direct lights. The texture has improved considerably, especially on my inner-thighs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product. It takes time and is sort of a pain in the beginning to have to apply twice a day, but it&#x27;s worth it. Your stretch marks won&#x27;t disappear, but they will be much less noticeable (depending on the initial severity). Based on the significant improvements to my own moderate case of stretch marks, I definitely hope to continue usage- as long as I can learn to go easy on how much I use considering the high price-tag!</li>
    <li> The scent is so obnoxious I had to shower. I used it on my belly and I am breastfeeding my newborn and I was especially concerned about her exposure to such strong fragrance. Even if I wasn&#x27;t nursing, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this lotion because of the awful smell.</li>
    <li> Duh... who thought this would really work? Ok.. I did. I gave it a try. I&#x27;m a gullible person I guess... with stretch marks. They swear this stuff will fix those... and &#x27;guarantee&#x27; it... or your money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back.</li>
    <li> Great product definitely recommended  to other women especially prenatal women or recently pregnant woman. The marks were gone in two weeks of using the product.</li>
    <li> I got this for someone else. They used it for a while. But then they got to fat and lazy to use it. so Can&#x27;t say much about it.</li>
    <li> Bad smell, i used for four weeks before i ran out. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Works great even after the little parasite In me popped out. Has reduced a good amount of stretch marks and faded a fair amount as well.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t really see a difference but that could have also been because I may have no used it long enough.</li>
    <li> Not as fast acting as professed or the reviews say - been using 3 weeks and still no change.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my cousins stretch marks and it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t work, I wasted my money on this.</li>
    <li> I had these horrible, purple stretch marks all over my lower abdomen due to my first pregnancy.  Approximately two months after giving birth, I was finally feeling well enough to focus on the more superficial effects of pregnancy.  Thus, I started using this cream twice a day... sometimes three times a day if I showered midday instead of in the mornings.  I wasn&#x27;t too hopeful after not seeing much change after a month, but I continued using it for the full three months.  Now the stretch marks have lightened significantly, and they are also much smoother.  I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say I&#x27;ll be sporting a bikini anytime soon, but I can&#x27;t blame that all on Mederma, lol.  After reading previous reviews, I was fully prepared to have to re-purchase every month, but I was pleasantly surprised to still have a third of my original tube left at the end of the three months.  With regard to the smell, I didn&#x27;t mind it at all and my husband never mentioned anything either.  Overall, I am satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it.  As gross as it is, I took some before and after photos so others know what they can expect.</li>
    <li> Bottom line it worked for me. Strangely when I received it it smelled a little funny compared to what I have been used to it smelling like. It just smelled like it might have gone bad but not returning. It still works and I just use it at night now.</li>
    <li> smells good and leaves skin soft, but not sure it&#x27;s actually working or worth the money</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a little background on why I chose this product for my stretch marks. I am a first time mom who got strectch marks in the last week and a half of pregnancy. When they first showed up on my tummy, I got on Amazon and ordered this product because my sister had used it and gotten great results. I only use it once a day (the package says to use it twice a day), but my stretch marks have faded nicely, and they&#x27;re very smooth. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over 8 months and I am so happy to say that you can barely notice my stretch marks anymore. I noticed that they were fading about six weeks after I started using it. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the smell as some other reviewers have, but I&#x27;m not going to complain when it gets the job done! If you&#x27;re looking to fade your stretch marks, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> It seemed to help some but so expensive can&#x27;t use daily for weeks at a time .</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than a year now with no positive result as claimed by the product. I wonder if their money back guarantee also holds or not......it&#x27;s very expensive and I can only think back as to how much money I have spent on this product just to see no results.....one tube lasts you around a month and I have been using it for more than a year.....it&#x27;s just a waste of money.....do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> This is amazing ! I was sceptical at first, because I just wasn&#x27;t sure. But after trying the product for about one month.. I knew it was going to work. I did the 12 week therapy and it worked great. I had purple stretch marks around my belly button after giving birth, and in about 4 weeks they weren&#x27;t purple anymore. After 6 weeks they where fading and by the end of the therapy, they are barely noticeable. I did the subscription to save a little bit so I still have extra bottles thay I didn&#x27;t use and I still apply it here and there. But it does work just as the instructions say.  L</li>
    <li> save your money, this doesn&#x27;t work. it smells really great though but it&#x27;s far too expensive for that to be the only benefit.</li>
    <li> I used it for a month and gave up. It didn&#x27;t fade my stretch marks at all. It may work if you apply it for months or a year but Im too impatient for that.</li>
    <li> My old stretch marks had gotten worse over the years, as I gained and lost weight. This lotion has made a very noticeable difference in their appearance. My boyfriend also loves how soft my skin is. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again...it&#x27;s got a nice smell to it...that&#x27;s about it. I know nothing ever takes off stretch marks completely, but I at least expected a small improvement...nothing.</li>
    <li> This smells good, but it&#x27;s expensive and I&#x27;m not convinced it works. I&#x27;m applying it while still pregnant and the stretch marks on my stomach haven&#x27;t gotten worse, so maybe the lotion is fending them off. I&#x27;m only five months, so I&#x27;ll update in a few months when I decide if it&#x27;s doing more than preventing existing marks from getting worse.</li>
    <li> This product does work to reduce stretch marks, however in place of the stretch marks I got a horrible rash that will NOT go away even though I discontinued use. I would have rather lived with the stretch marks than this rash. This product is not for people with sensitive skin, as it will most likely irritate it.</li>
    <li> this is the most great stretch marks therapy my marks almost gone in a week, I love this product</li>
    <li> I been using the cream for the passed month, I still got a few strech marks but I&#x27;m still using the cream.</li>
    <li> It absorbs really well, it smells nice and it not too strong for the one with sensitive nose. I am using it during the pregnancy and will after, to see if it helps with the marks since I have a type of skin prone to it.</li>
    <li> Sadly, after consulting my doctor I was told that most stretch marks are permanent unless you have surgery to remove them.  Creams and things can reduce their appearance but mostly that&#x27;s in your head.  Sadly even after consulting photographs I tool before and after, I could little to no improvement.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this product for 6 weeks and I do not notice any changes. Probably is because my strech marks are a few years old. I know once you have a strech mark it will always stay with you but I wanted to give it a try before I gave up on any treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Some people mentioned that the smell was funny, mine smelled just fine, actually kind of pleasant, but the marks are still there, so I guess the smell is irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;If your marks are new give it a try, otherwise don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend this product for post pregnancy!! It worked so well in moisturizing and smoothing marks on my belly! Very surprising how well it worked!</li>
    <li> Smells good but thats about it. Does nothing for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I like the product as it shows some improvement on my skin. My stretch marks is getting better few weeks after use, and it&#x27;ll be best if follow the instructions. I would recommend this product to my friends who will need it.</li>
    <li> Okay so I gave this product two stars because I noticed immediately how soft the the skin with the stretch marks are become very soft. Which is great, but other lotion can do the same thing. The smell is very bad so this is not something you want to put on throughout the day. This product gave my no results when it comes to healing stretch marks and mine are extreamly new. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff significantly made my stretch marks fade. It took about the whole bottle, though, when I looked ad noticed, &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any results when used as prescribed.</li>
    <li> The product actually works. I had bad stretch marks due to some weight gain, after 2-3 weeks, gone. Really recommend this Mederma.</li>
    <li> I had a scar from 3 years ago and hated it was noticeable. After using this product for 3 weeks I have notice that it has gotten lighter and not so much noticeable. It&#x27;s also easy to apply and does not smell bad at all. Shipping was fast and quick. Would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work. After applying liberally and as often as recommended, still no results. Let&#x27;s all just embrace our stretch marks together! What do you say?!</li>
    <li> Used it constantly for a month before I stopped. Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, very very minimal. Maybe it would&#x27;ve faded more if I kept using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. I have seen my numerous deep, angry red stretchmarks fade to pale. It does take quite awhile to see results, but I know it wouldn&#x27;t have happened naturally because trust me, I tried to wait it out and see if they would fade on their own. Mederma is expensive, afterall. I had extensive stretch marks on the front and sides of my abdomen, and some on my arms, and I ended up going through about 2 tubes before getting my ideal results. Just be sure to follow the directions-- You should put it on twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend who thinks this stuff didn&#x27;t work because it didn&#x27;t make her fine, pale stretchmarks go away, but everyone should know that the actual stretchmarks themselves never *can* go away. Stretchmarks are scars. What this lotion does is make them much, much less noticeable.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t the highest quality, but if you&#x27;re looking to pull off something without prescription, these will do just fine!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money, since the product did not work for me. I used it for about two months, but did not notice any changes. Luckily, I found another stretch mark cream that is effective and works great.</li>
    <li> Been using product for almost 1 month so far and I see results.  I took pictures on day 1 and day 22.  Still have plenty left in the tube before I need to buy another.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have read reviews where women have complained this product is a rip off and didn&#x27;t work, but everyone is different. Everyone&#x27;s skin is unique so no product will work for everyone. It did work for me though! I have seen a visible difference in the texture and depth of my stretch marks. The only con- the smell is a little strong. Its not a pretty girly lotion scent. But its not aweful to the point where I can&#x27;t stand it. I would definetly recommend this to my friends and fellow moms. Give it a try! It might just work for you!</li>
    <li> Didnt see much of a change, smells great though</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make them magically disappear but made me happy enough to buy more. Super soft skin too! I would buy all the time if I could afford it</li>
    <li> This initially worked well during my mid-pregnancy but to the end it didn&#x27;t do much. Can&#x27;t fight nature. The odor is very strong. Will keep trying and see how it goes. Very expensive!</li>
    <li> I put this cream on day and night until gone and there was no difference. Super bummed.  Not worth your cash</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!! I was using this product while the pregnancy and for 4 month afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Then went to the beach and nothing appear!!!</li>
    <li> I received a similar product not the one in the picture I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just different packaging</li>
    <li> I started seeing results within the first week. As time went on the speed of the results started to slow down</li>
    <li> Item as described and well packaged</li>
    <li> I started using this lotion a week after delivery for a month and I def saw results. You really need to follow the instructions exactly so you can actually get results. You can&#x27;t just apply it without massaging it into your skin, when you massage it in your skin absorbs more of it.</li>
    <li> it dont work........plain and simple........you can keep trying but it does take away some of the redness but that is it...</li>
    <li> I gave birth in July by c-section and bought this a couple of months later in hopes of diminishing the appearance of my scar and stretch marks. It works great! Took a few weeks for my skeptical eye to notice, but my belly looks almost normal after only about 6 weeks of use! And I have half a bottle left. No more red and purple stretch marks that ripple under my finger; my skin is smooth with nearly invisible lines that hint as to what I used to look like. I definitely recommend to everyone! Would be a great gift for a new mom!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Started noticing results right away. I have only been using the product for about 3 weeks and I can see a huge improvement.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and delivered. Good product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Unlucky me, I was blessed with stretch marks during my child baring years. And to this day, I haven&#x27;t figured how some women can have multilple births and never get a stretch mark. A couple of years ago, I found out about Mederma Stretch Marks, tried it. I truly like the results, now don&#x27;t get me wrong it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the stretch marks however it does makes them easier to live with, meaning the cream blends them in better with your skin tone and some areas the stretch have appear reduced. I&#x27;ll continue to use the product and would recommend it to anyone woman with stretch marks or if there considering an additon to the family.</li>
    <li> I tried. I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market. It may not be Mederma. It may be me. My stretch marks are over 20 years old. I still like the scent and the balance of moisture and non-greasiness. It&#x27;s just not undoing the damage I did to my skin when I was pregnant and itchy and non-moisturized.</li>
    <li> I had a head injury back in 2009 and had to get 47 stitches across my forehead. Luckily I found Mederma scar cream and now the scar is barely visible. I was soo excited to see that Mederma also had stretch mark lotion. I just started using it so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s really as good as the scar cream. It does smell great though which is always a bonus!</li>
    <li> I have used and tried everything out there to help with stretch marks. See I had a baby and gained 45 pounds and than lost a lot of the weight but in doing that I had stretch marks everywhere plus I had a c-section so I had a a pretty big scar across my lower abdomen now with this product my scars and stretch marks have been disappearing within 3 uses I would recommend this product to any woman who has had a c-section or stretch marks on any part of their body this product is a miracle worker. I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone of my family members and friends</li>
    <li> Not a single stretch mark yet!</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of my stretch marks yet, but skin feels luxuriously soft so love it anyway.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try this cream for awhile and just never got around to getting it.  It&#x27;s to early to tell if the cream is working but I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feeling a bit softer, which it good.</li>
    <li> It seems to do a good enough job. It hasn&#x27;t let them magically disappear or anything. They just appear a bit lighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 yr old female and I have a 3yr old that left me with some not so wonderful stretch marks on by butt. I have been using mederma for a little over 4 weeks now, but have yet to see any sort of improvement. I know there is really nothing much you can do for them, but I thought mederma would help them a little bit. I also know I&#x27;m supposed to use it for 12 weeks total for better results but I doubt I&#x27;ll see any difference at this point.</li>
    <li> Ok well just reminding that stretch marks are kinda hard to fade. Well I knew it works already butt pretty slow mi friend who worked at a pharmacy got it for for the price of 24$ why not I said.  At the begining of the year after giving birth they were still kinda purplesh red but then again this were the most ugly stretch marks in the work my waist sz is 34in and the sz of my stretch marks were to the bottom of my low waist to a little past half my stomach and they wore horriby thick. Ive invested alot but I know it works I got like 2 bottles the 1st yr another the 2nd yr and found it here so it my 4th bottle now but they have fade awhole looot since they were before especially since there old stretch marks alot harder to fade but let me tell you another secret ive been using vicks vapor rub in a combination with this and I also see a difference with using vicks I think if I just use mederma I would have to get a 5th bottle.  Every skin is different I dint want to get a product of 100$ so at the end it wouldnt work thats why I got this for 4th time cuz I have the security it will work for my ugly stretch marks slowly but it works!&lt;br /&gt;I know im crazy vicks vapor rub but hey it works and im desprete to getting these off:/</li>
    <li> This product does not work.</li>
    <li> i love the brand i&#x27;&#x27;ve used it scar treatment but the streatch mark does smell very clinical its not the worst smell its just not smelling like dior which is fine with me since its not a lotion i would use for scent but does  very good job at fading old as well as new and makes skin softer which is nice</li>
    <li> I bought this cream in mid January and started using it immediately (I am now on bottle #2). My use for it was not related to pregnancy, but to training for a half marathon that resulted in some stretch marks, mainly on my thighs. I have been applying a generous amount of the cream twice a day (when I wake up and when I go to bed), and have just started to notice a real difference. The more severe marks are lightening and some of the less severe are now barely visible. Since it&#x27;s only been 6 weeks they still have a ways to go, but I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I suspect I will need to purchase one more bottle to get me to 12 weeks and I may continue to use this cream beyond that in a preventative manner. It is pricey, by the end of 12 weeks I will have spent nearly $100 (three bottles) - but I believe it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I completed two rounds of this. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Maybe if you use it as soon as you get stretch marks it might work for you.</li>
    <li> Note if you have a lot of stretch marks like I do you will need more tg en just one vottle of this per month... its been a week and a half and I am out of the first bottle. The stretch marks do look lighter I&#x27;m hoping for almost gone. I gained over 90 pounds while I was pregnant and I have only lost 56 pounds of it...looking forward to the 130s and 140s again cain wait slw and stead wins the rase :))</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I purchased mederma stretch mark cream since trying cocoa butter never seemed to help and left my skin oily. I have applied mederma almost everyday for 2 weeks now and I have seen a difference. Hopefully after the 4 weeks of applying, my results will be even better. This product has lightened the redness of my stretch marks but not completely. I would say every women who feels embarrassed of their stretch marks should def use this product. Give it time and make sure you use it everyday. I have only been applying in the afternoon but it says to apply 2 times a day which I will be doing for better results. Good luck to all using this product!</li>
    <li> Smells great! But there&#x27;s not a lot of cream to be able to apply twice a day and wait 8 weeks to notice the difference. I would have to buy 2 bottles and take a picture and try again. When I do, I will give a different review of what the product actually does. Thus far, it smells great and it feels great on skin.</li>
    <li> Presently into 3rd week of use and noticing lightened stretch marks. Definitely anxious to see results after completing the optimal regimen time of 12 weeks.</li>
    <li> Highly disappointed. Used 2 bottles and didn&#x27;t see any changes. Applied as directed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to diminish appearance of my pregnancy stretch marks. So far I&#x27;ve had great results and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months</li>
    <li> I loved the fragrance. Great product, but you&#x27;ll need to use this with other products (cellex c, cocoa butter, vitamin E oil, etc).</li>
    <li> Still using, has a weird smell but my c section scar is healing nicely, won&#x27;t know for a few more weeks  how it does overall</li>
    <li> This is the best stretch mark lotion. My wife loves it since she got first pregnant she already started using it and i can&#x27;t see any stretch mark on her. She uses this lotion everyday for nine months now and this 5.29 oz still has a lot in it. And i think it will last more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a stretch mark remover this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after i had my son, i had some red stretch marks that developed after i gave birth. I used the cream faithfully for approx. 30 days. It has def. reduced the redness. I would recommend to anyone :)</li>
    <li> Im on the fence.. i havent bought this product or tried it yet.. and i am still doing my research in comparison of other methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to point out alot of people have mentioned this product is supposed to be used on new stretch marks.  Well... new stretch marks are angry and red right?  New stretch marks are eventually going to fade somewhat and smooth out a bit as they heal (though we know not completely).  So really.. is it all that successful of a product if you are using it and seeing \\&quot;some\\&quot; improvement when your body is naturally taking care of that on its own?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like a more accurate gauge of how significant these improvements are, in conjuction with you bodies own natural healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inability to improve older stretch mark is what makes this fishy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Ended up purchasing the product to see for myself.. and it seems to be working well enough.  It does indeed seem to speed up the process and the color fading though dont expect miracles.  I like the smell of it too, though it is somewhat reminicent of the smell of hair salon when you first walk in( to me anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is my second pregnancy im recovering from and the stretch marks are indeed fading faster this time with the maderma then my first recovery without the use of any product.</li>
    <li> I have givin this a 4 star rating only because I have yet to notice any fading in discoloration. Although I&#x27;m only about 4 weeks into it and it does state \\&quot;12 weeks for optimum results\\&quot;. I have about 8 left, I hope to start seeing more improvements! It has totally taken the texture out and is smooth to the touch and mind you mine are 5 years old. So like I said hope it starts taking the purple out soon :/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it runs out quick I would order a few but I use alot cuz I don&#x27;t feel like a dot is gonna cut it. That&#x27;s just me:-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks but haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  I&#x27;ll use it for the recommended 12 weeks but so far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> Mederma was not bad but the results did not last. They were temporary and once I stopped using the cream the color of my stretch mark came back. I recently tried Strydexin and it worked really well for me. Still using it and results are better so far! [[ASIN:B00B5Y2MME Strydexin (4 oz.) Concentrated Stretch Mark &amp; Skin Repair Formula]]</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 months ago. Haven&#x27;t used it everyday but have used it maybe two times a weeks and I already see my stretch marks from my pregnancy from 6 years ago fading away and shrinking. I know if I would have used this everyday I would have excellent results, rather than just the good results so far. Awesome stuff. And smells great!</li>
    <li> lotion that doesn&#x27;t really work unless you buy it every three months and use nonstop. it smells wonderful but you have to spend a lot of money to get the results</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have any effect on me.</li>
    <li> Sadly, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I used this product for 2 months and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. After reading through several reviews and doing some research on my own I decided to order It Works Stretch Mark Cream - THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING! My 8 year old stretchmarks post children have diminished significantly and I am more comfortable in my own skin, finally!  I made the mistake of ordering through Amazon and paid $70. But through Instagram I found a distributor&#x27;s website kmstarks.myitworks.com and am now paying only $39 for the product (worth EVERY penny!!).</li>
