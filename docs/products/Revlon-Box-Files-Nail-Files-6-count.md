<li> I got these for my daughter because she wanted little ones that she could take to school.  </li>
<li> BTY, my nails are very thin and soft!</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m making small goodie bags with mini sized polishes and lotions so they will work.</li>
<li> These files are a bit small</li>
<li> Too small and awkward to use properly.</li>
<li> hard to use because of size.</li>
<li> Too expensive for what you get.</li>

    <li> These files are a bit small but I&#x27;m making small goodie bags with mini sized polishes and lotions so they will work. Don&#x27;t know that I would use them for anything else though since they are pretty tiny.</li>
    <li> these files don&#x27;t look at all like the picture. got them for part of a baby girl shower favor because of the pink design. ordered for 30-35 people and only 2 of the boxes of six even had pink on them. 3boxes are red and maroon and 1 box is blue and black. doesn&#x27;t say in the ad they are assorted designs and you take what you get. very disapointed,too late to order something else.</li>
    <li> Total RIP OFF! Thought they were going to be NORMAL size filers - they are smaller than my pinkie finger GRRRRRRRRR</li>
    <li> Very upset not the right color. Too expensive for what you get.</li>

    <li> Perfect to fit in small purse!</li>
    <li> The lime breaks and falls with a single nail. No corner left after one session. They are also too soft, so they bend too much making imposible to properly shape a nail. BTY, my nails are very thin and soft!</li>
    <li> Cute. Easy to keep one in the makeup bag for nail emergencies.</li>
    <li> I actually use these to file my baby&#x27;s nails!  The baby files were too soft to do anything and these are the perfect size to file without accidentally rubbing on other little fingers in the process.</li>
