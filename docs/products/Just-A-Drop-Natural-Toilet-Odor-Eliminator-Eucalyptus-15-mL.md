<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice fragrance but when you drop it in the toilet, it just disappears. Not much smell at all and doesn&#x27;t do anything for odor.</li>
    <li> Very nice product that makes the bathroom a better place.  I never knew this type of product existed and it works wonderfully.  I would get the blue bottle.  The pink bottle smells nice, but not as effective.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0019SPNQ8 Just A Drop Toilet Odor Reduce Neutralizer - 15 Ml]]  I work for a Healthcare company  and this ad caught my eye.  When using the bathroom I try to be courteous (like in courteous flush) but with Just a Drop this is not necessary.  Believe me when I say you only need Just a Drop!!!!!.  I have a small bottle I carry in my purse, one drop takes away all odor. When I leave the bathroom there are no odors what so ever. This product really does what it says it does. A big plus is it&#x27;s cost effectiveness. I still have my original bottle I orderd in April which is more than half full.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, this product is absolutely and amazingly effective. Had nothing to consume all day but corn beef hash, cabbage and beans? Taco Tuesday? All you can eat Indian curry? - Have no fear, the poop drops are here - and they&#x27;ve got your rear covered!Alright - let&#x27;s get down to \\&quot;business.\\&quot; Drop a few (come on, be mature) drops of \\&quot;product\\&quot; into the ole porcelain goddess watery eye - and you immediately see the drops react with the water. Exactly what they&#x27;re doing - I have no idea, but you see it immediately spread out across the water and have some sort of \\&quot;reaction\\&quot; with the water.... it&#x27;s quite strange. You can smell the product - and it has an interesting citrus like scent to it, certainly not like an air freshener or something designed to mask the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your business, for the love of god wipe a few times, flush and wash your hands. Leave the bathroom - walk back in 5 seconds later, and there is no scent or clue of the ungodly demons you had just relentlessly battled and conquered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now.... being the scientist, and humanitarian that I am - I had to well... you know - make sure my olfactory system hadn&#x27;t melted, and \\&quot;test\\&quot; the effectiveness on someone else who hadn&#x27;t experienced \\&quot;the fury.\\&quot; Let me just say (I am in sooo much trouble) calling over the Mrs. to \\&quot;test\\&quot; your experiment isn&#x27;t a very smart idea.... what I do for you people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after the very un-amused Mrs. figured out why I had called her over to the \\&quot;depository\\&quot; - after I repeatedly snickered \\&quot;can you (HHHAHAHAHAH) smell anything?\\&quot; she was pretty perturbed. Despite the severe tongue lashing I received - we were both pleased (and I am still alive) to report - no malodor was detected.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a family member of mine. Apparently you can find it cheaper else where. So far she has been happy with this product and says it works great and shed buy more!</li>
    <li> The service was great, but a small bottle of cheap perfume would do just fine.</li>
    <li> This product works! I ordered it on a whim from SkyMall and tested it out at home before using it while traveling.  My friend and I used it several times and it got rid of that stuffy \\&quot;poop\\&quot; smell, especially in low ventilated hotel bathrooms.  Now I use it on all trips and multiple user bathroom situations.  Some make fun, but after using it, become believers!  It has an interesting smell, but not bad, just different so I keep it in a plastic baggie.  It does take about 4-5 drops instead of 1, but the bottle lasted me quite a while.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. No need to buy it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Work as described and much easier to dispense than the spray types.</li>
    <li> I keep a bottle of this in each of my bathrooms, and one in my purse, for traveling. It really works.</li>
    <li> Out of it need to get  more</li>
    <li> great product. service time was good. it&#x27;s doing everything I need to do. that&#x27;s why I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Just a Drop does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, with only a drop.  We are very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> Works every time.  Wonderful product</li>
    <li> This is the thing to have in your purse when you are not at home and can&#x27;t wait. Really does cover up any odor.</li>
    <li> We received a sample and thought we&#x27;d try it. Not thinking it would really work, we left it in a guest bathroom. Remarkably, we heard the bathroom fan run less often and there&#x27;s far fewer smells left behind. A strangely unique product that solves an age-old, but always embarassing problem. Especially for guests!</li>
    <li> Simply said... THIS PRODUCT WORKS!!!!! Two drops and done. There is also a nice little countertop container to hold the bottle in the packaging.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cover the oder at all - smelled weird and made matters even worse.</li>
    <li> Added a drop.. nothing.. added 2 drops.. nothing.. added 3 drops.. NOTHING!!!  Provided no scent what so ever... very disappointing...</li>
    <li> You need this if you&#x27;re doing a girl&#x27;s weekend away, and no one wants to admit to having to &amp;#34;use the bathroom.&amp;#34;  it&#x27;s a perfect idea! I also suggest it for that office environment where both men and women share a bathroom. I&#x27;ve had this little bottle over a year, and truly, just a drop or two works great.</li>
    <li> Works well for the price but poo-pouri works better.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s great to carry in my purse for use when unexpected trips to the bathroom occur at stranger&#x27;s homes.</li>
    <li> It really keeps bathroom fresh smelling.  This is important to me;  a clean bathroom is a must in my house.</li>
    <li> It really did eliminate most of the odor, though you do need more than one drop. It is small enough to bring it on trip too.</li>
    <li> I like it much better than the spray I used to buy.  It does the job.</li>
    <li> This definitely works, but as others have mentioned you will probably need more than just a drop.  This is a much better product for stopping odors where they start rather than air freshener after the fact.  My only complaint would be the expense, it is rather pricey.  I did look for &amp; found an economy size directly from the manufacturer, which is a huge savings.</li>
    <li> It works...meant as funny stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> I went away with friends and they said they had this in their bathroom for all the guests. I didn&#x27;t think it would work, but it did. I bought the travel size and put it in my purse for times when I may need it. I use 2-3 drops instead of just one. It&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;m thinking about getting it as stocking stuffers for my close family.</li>
    <li> This product really works;it gets the job done by neutralizing the unpleasant smells and making it seem like they never existed.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. It does not work that great. Not sure why I bought it based on just reviews! Save your money.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased two bottles of Just A Drop from a national catalog and loved it.  Then I saw it on Amazon.com and ordered four more.  In my house, one bottle lasts for four months or more.  No more aerosol cans of spray that are environmentally harmful, not to mention getting on everything in the bathroom.  I would recommend Just A Drop to anyone who wants a natural way to eliminate bathroom odors.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, this product works great!  It creates a seal on the top of the water which holds in embarrassing odors.  I keep re-ordering more. Even my extended family loves this product. Try it. It works great!</li>
    <li> An innovative idea that amazingly works. Easy to use dispenser bottle. However, product smell may be too strong for sensitive people.</li>
    <li> saw it on dr oz and he says he uses it if it&#x27;s good enough for him it&#x27;;s good enough for me it really does work everyone who doesn&#x27;t live alone should have it</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how well Just One Drop really works! I have no idea how it works, but the smell is basically non-existent! I am ordering the travel size now. I am really not sure how I lived without it before.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a joke for someone.  Everyone had a good laugh so it was worth it just for that!</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I gave it only four stars as I&#x27;m not real fond of the fragrance nor of the dark blue dye.  If this was made in fresh scents, i.e., lemon, orange, etc., and in clear liquid form, I&#x27;d be more apt to purchase again.  I find that one drop does not suffice for our household, it&#x27;s usually two to three to work properly!</li>
    <li> This product actually does what it says it does. Try it. The rest of your family will be glad you did. It really only takes a drop.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says and if you want to hide embarrasing odors, this is the product. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This actually works!!</li>
    <li> Very effective and one bottle lasts a long time.  Small bottle is easy to carry discreetly.  Great for college students or for those at work.</li>
    <li> love this product !  take it anywhere in the smallest purse and it works like it is supposed to .  great!</li>
    <li> This fits perfectly in my purse and easy to take anywhere.  Refreshes the bathroom when necessity dictates without masking perfumes.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a friend of mine, honestly. She said its not helpful, in fact, she said she cares not for the scent</li>
    <li> Family reunion for a long weekend. With 20 people in a house didn&#x27;t mind sharing the bathrooms with this product available. Works beautifully. My husband overdid the drops and it was too strong. You truly only need a drop or two at most. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have had crohns/IBS for over a decade now...trust me this works...I use 2 drops +/- and good to go</li>
    <li> We keep a bottle in the bathroom and have a tiny travel size one as well.  Just one drop really works!  Now if I could just get my husband to remember to use it!!</li>
    <li> My wife saw this on the Doctor Oz Show and wanted to try it.  Happy to say, it just works.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, heard of this, and man does it work......my teenage son, loves it, great price, will have in each bath room at all times, even carry in my purse. lol</li>
    <li> Amazing that it works so well. Great for any communal living arrangements. Take it to the hotel with you and make your family happy!</li>
    <li> Best thing to hit the market since sliced bread</li>
    <li> This is the best little drop of deodorizer money can buy, try it you most definitely fall in love with it. I will order three more of this little giant so I can&lt;br /&gt;have one in  all of the bath rooms.</li>
    <li> Much better than spraying dedorizer</li>
    <li> smells like pine-sol ugh</li>
    <li> Wow!! This odor eliminator is one of a kind!! I have used this product from a solid stool to the runniest diarrhea. In all scenarios, this product completely elimated smell. I&#x27;ve suffered with putrid stool for years, after investing in this product, I can go at work without everyone knowing!!!</li>
    <li> the product is misrepresented it&#x27;s a lie. It works the first 6 times and then is ineffective. I believe that as oxygen mixes with the liquid it starts to lose it&#x27;s effectiveness. The company that sells it knows this and they are deliberately misrepresenting to the consumer.</li>
    <li> As a teacher who has to share a bathroom with students and colleagues, I can&#x27;t tell you what a godsend this product is. It really works! A quick spray of some natural orange room spray, and the bathroom smells more like an orchard than a sewer! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It works better than nothing - - - but the drops do not work as well as the spray brand that is also sold on Amazon.  It takes more than 2 drops and the drops scent is much more subtle than the spray brand which is a stronger scented deodorizer.  Love this concept, but I need to find out if they sell a device that will automatically dispense an odor neutralizer into the toilet bowl at home because men just don&#x27;t think to use the drops beforehand even if the bottle is sitting right there beside the toilet!</li>
    <li> NOT worth the $ - it&#x27;s not even worth a dime.  I got this to see if it was any good -and it is not.  it is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;My advise - buy Poo Pourri.  Poo Pourri is worth it - It is husband and teenage boy proof!!</li>
    <li> Bought one for me and my son. When company comes and you have one bathroom you&#x27;ll be glad you have this product, only wish it was in a spray.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, travelled to Ethiopia with a group. Did not want to risk offending anyone but was not going to do what many do and NOT go. (How does one speak of l&#x27;eau issues without sounding like a 3 year old?) We were there to do a lot of work and attend a meeting at the UN in Addis Ababa. No way was something as, well, basic going to cause me issues. The woman who was my roommate was thrilled with this product and soon enough my wee bottle made its way through everyone&#x27;s rooms. Each and every person loved it. Since then, have never been without a bottle. We keep one in every bathroom and I have one, always, in my carry-on travel bag. There may be other scents out there but we all love the eucalyptus. And let me tell you, when all you have between you have learned to love what is called &amp;#34;fake banana&amp;#34; leaves as toilet paper, you can really appreciate this product when you are inside and have plumbing inside as well. Have given this as gifts and people have always said that they had thought...&amp;#34;ewwwww&amp;#34; but tried and went &amp;#34;awwwww&amp;#34;. This is the ideal product for kids in a dorm, for roommate situations, for traveling on a plane (I mean really, how many times have you travelled on a long flight and thought...WTH did that person eat?) if you have a lot of folks coming and going (pun unintended) in your home and of course in an office situation. There is another product out there that has terrific commercials. But it is significantly more expensive and from my experience, not as good.</li>
    <li> It truly hides the odor.  There is finally a product that you can put in the toilet to kill the ordor.  I will always carry it around with me.</li>
    <li> Warning: I am going to be a tiny bit graphic.  If you have not read &#x27;Everyone Poops&amp;#34; by Taro Gomi you may want to stop reading now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. Here is the scoop.  If your poops are heavy enough to be sinkers this product will work well.  If you tend to drop &#x27;floaters&#x27; it does not work so good. If you have Montezuma&#x27;s revenge, the Hershey squirts and anything like that forget it. Light a match and blame someone else</li>
    <li> Great especially when out of your home. Amazing how it masks the odor entirely and without a noxious perfumey or floral note</li>
    <li> I first heard about this product on the Dr. Oz show about two years ago and it has served me well since then.  I would buy it again and again and totally recommend it to others.  It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping it would take care of embarrassing odors after going to the bathroom.  I&#x27;ve had gastric bypass surgery which makes this problem even worse, I tried this and the Poo Pourri and the Poo Pourri works much better, it hides the odor better and leaves a much nicer fragrance behind so I carry it in my purse and leave the just a drop at home.  It may work better for others than it did me so try it you never know</li>
    <li> PERFECT to use in all public places....I bought it for a trip and it came very handy in the airplane and the restaurant....it really is an odor eliminator.....even at home, when I have guests. Everybody knows they can use it, if they need to......</li>
    <li> This stuff does not smell great, but think of the alternative.  It seems to only mask the smell of small quantities, too. If a man uses your bathroom, be prepared with a box of matches as backup.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on Dr Oz.  I am VERY pleased!  Gave a bottle to each of my adult kids.</li>
    <li> Using this before you &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; works somewhat. However, the smell is not great--like fir trees or something, but not in a good way. We ended up not really using it.</li>
    <li> It really does work! Of course not 100% of the smell will be eliminated because some of it comes in gases. Also, and this may be TMI, your business must be submerged in the water for its smell to be blocked. So, sit back (literally), relax, and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one drop is not enough :( try two or three.</li>
    <li> I love this odor neutralizer! It really works before and after you use the restroom. If you are doing #2 it greatly reduces the smell. Plus it helps when the restroom is busy and you don&#x27;t have to let it air out before entering the room.</li>
    <li> I take  this everywhere  I have one in every bathroom in my house. I have one at work for those moments. And I have a travel size in my luggage for those road trips.</li>
    <li> I received a similar product which was being given out as a promotional item. It worked great. When I ran out I purchased this product thinking it was the same thing. NOT!! This product did not work well at all.</li>
    <li> Great.  I put in a drop and no-one knew that I had pooped.</li>
    <li> Just not what was expected.</li>
    <li> This is a really great little thing for your bathroom air quality. That is unless of course someone poops lots of air before they actually have solids come out. Then, in that case, it is useless. And we all know that the air that emits right before solids is the most offensive, gagging, nausea inducing thing ever! That is where a high speed ceiling exhaust fan comes in handy. I have a jet engine fan in my public bathroom in my home. It, however, will suck up small children and pets when in operation. I have signs posted on door: \\&quot;Beware of ceiling exhaust fan when in operation. It sucks. Small children must be accompanied by an adult and pets must be on a leash\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, it works!  A must have if you share a bathroom and don&#x27;t want unpleasant odors left behind.  Only use 1-2 drops though, as the menthol scent is strong.</li>
    <li> This little item is GREAT for kids in dorms.  I bought it for that purpose a few years ago. Now my daughter lives in a house&lt;br /&gt;with 4 people and one bathroom, and she was thrilled when I sent her some more.  Don&#x27;t know how, but it works.</li>
    <li> It works! There are several brands and versions of this product, but this one isn&#x27;t too shabby. I&#x27;ve only ever tried this scent.</li>
    <li> Amazing,fantastic product. It&#x27;ll be my Christmas present for everybody this year. I can now return the Port-O-Potty I have parked out side in the driveway.</li>
    <li> My mother likes this product as she would take it in her purse if she was going somewhere as well as using it at her home. I purchased this one to try.  It is true.  You do just put in 1 drop and that&#x27;s it. It semi coats the top of the toilet water to create a barrier of some sort.  The only problem is ( and I am not trying to be funny) is that I don&#x27;t like the smell of the product:)  However, it beats alternative odors.  Would be great for hotel rooms when there is more than just you.  Just sit it on the back of the toilet and hope people use it.</li>
    <li> Great when in public bathrooms or peoples homes.</li>
    <li> This is a most amazing product. A drop or two will do the job of keeping your bathroom fresh and odor-free. i have been using the Eucalyptus Just A Drop for several years. The travel size is great for when you are on the move. Follow the directions and you will love the results!</li>
    <li> does not work as well as other types i have used. i would not buy it again. i can buy a better product locally</li>
    <li> My crap has been smelling so bad the older it get.....I can&#x27;t even take it any longer!  I don&#x27;t know how....but this stuff works!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing! !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Horribly strong chemical smell... Makes this smell worse than with nothing.  Yuck. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It does what it says with just one or two drips, I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for at least 9-12 months and it&#x27;s still going. No more smelly bathrooms!</li>
    <li> I GOT IT FOR MY 90 YEAR OLD MOM.  IT DID NOTHING FOR HER TOILET.</li>
    <li> I brought this with on a family vacation where we had to share a bathroom with 8 people.  My private bathroom moments were kept private.  Now I keep some in my purse, just in case.</li>
    <li> Helps suppress odors.</li>
    <li> Excellent odor control product.  I have one in each of my bathrooms.</li>
    <li> This really works and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
    <li> does a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the brand name (Poo-Pouri) but much cheaper...remember, it only takes a drop or two BEFORE you go.</li>
    <li> First off, it won&#x27;t take &amp;#34;Just A Drop&amp;#34;. It&#x27;ll take quite a few. That&#x27;s one. Two is that its not very effective. Especially when you compare it to a certain popular spray with &amp;#34;Poo&amp;#34; in the title. It just doesn&#x27;t work very well. And to think that I payed such a huge price for it. I keep it in the car just in case but it&#x27;s honestly next to worthless in my eyes and a waste of money. I don&#x27;t mean to sound harsh but this is the absolute truth of my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is truly a Great product !! This really,really works !!! Thank-you Dr. Oz for making us aware of this product !!</li>
    <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz show, and it lives up to his recommendation.  One little drop takes the strong odor away and leaves the bathroom with a pleasant scent.  I highly recommend this product.  It eliminates embarrassing exits from friends bathrooms as well as keeping my own in good spirits:)</li>
    <li> It is called Just a Drop, but more than that is needed.  Just a Squirt is more like it, and even a squirt may not always be effective.  Thought it would be the perfect solution when traveling with friends to avoid embarrassment, but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I can now stand to be in the same building as my husband! Crazy how this works! I need to stock up!</li>
    <li> Has a very strong odor similar to airline toilets.</li>
    <li> This is a good product to keep in your purse.  I know people have their preferences, and I do prefer Poo Pourri. Now that Poo Pourri has a slim travel size product I will use that.  Just a Drop does work fine.</li>
    <li> The smell from the bottle had me gagging, I think it covered the bm odor but honestly,  I am no longer looking to cover it up...</li>
    <li> I was very surprised and very pleased at how well this products works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you on the person that invented this product.</li>
    <li> This product works OK, but it smells like Vicks Vapor Rub. I have discovered another product called Porcelain that is much better.</li>
    <li> Could not, would not like to be without this product.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth the money. I have tried with boys I have at home, and it does not cut any smell, just adds a &amp;#34;amonia&amp;#34; like smell.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price to take care of a most private task!&lt;br /&gt;Use it and everyone in your family will appreciate you a little more than they did beforehand</li>
    <li> Nice product. Container is small enough for travel or just in your purse. It&#x27;s handy to have when a public restroom is stinky.</li>
    <li> I think the word &amp;#34;neutralizer&amp;#34; is reasonable for this product -- it helps &amp;#34;tone down&amp;#34; any bad smells, even if you put it in a bowl after you already flushed. It doesn&#x27;t totally eliminate odd smells, but I think it&#x27;s good enough that I would purchase another bottle when I run out.</li>
    <li> Works well in a very busy bathroom.  Our office orders this product fairly regularly and everyone is happy with the results.  Most of us order it for our homes, too.</li>
    <li> I must admit I was skeptical, but this stuff actually works!  I will be buying another to keep handy to use in the stall at work.</li>
    <li> unfortunately, it has its own odor that I don&#x27;t like.  So not sure I can recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> it really just adds a disgusting layer to the stench</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product. This is a reorder and the first lasted her for a few years. It&#x27;s just one of those things she keeps for emergency situations that we all have had.</li>
    <li> Need to use 2-4 drops but does the trick.  Nice to use quickly to avoid the smelliness when relieving yourself</li>
    <li> I have used this item a few times and it does not work completely. The body&#x27;s natural \\&quot;bad (#2 or any other number beyond #2)\\&quot; odor still lingers and the actual Just a Drop perfume/eucalyptus does not smell that powerful to mask the body&#x27;s \\&quot;bad\\&quot; odor.  You&#x27;re better off buying a very citrus inexpensive splash and use that.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. Seems to do the trick. It is very economical too.  Will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> These drops definitely eliminate toilet odor when used as directed. No overpowering smell from the product, either. Glad my fear of its scent being too strong was unfounded. Of course, one does have to remember to use it before &amp;#34;making.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great Product&lt;br /&gt;Great Product  Thanks and would buy again&lt;br /&gt;Will return for more merchandise I give it five stars definitely for sure</li>
    <li> I got this as a stocking stuffer for my step dad, I think he will think it&#x27;s hilarious. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but all the previous reviews said it was worth it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I have one in both bathrooms in my home.  Even carry one in my purse, just in case. It truly, truly works. It&#x27;s like the bottle says, you only need one drop. Definitely worth the money. Have even shared this product with friends and family members. They all love it and cannot believe how amazing it is. I would highly recommend taking on vacations or anywhere you go. No more embarassing odors! Love it!</li>
    <li> Much to my surprise, this really works. It is hard to just produce just one drop, but that is all it takes to do the job.</li>
    <li> Amazing how this actually works. This is great for taking with you anywhere you would share a public bathroom...college dorms, school, office, etc..</li>
    <li> Love it, works as instructed.  I have recommended this items to family members and friends.  Will definitely this product again.</li>
    <li> It works and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> Great always works, gave to friends and they were happily surprised</li>
    <li> All are advertised and we are using them. We would recommend them to anyone interested in them. The books are enjoyable.</li>
    <li> As long as you remember to put it in the bowl beforehand, it works like a charm. :) You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the claims made for this product.  Bottom line, it works very well. It probably reduces the &#x27;pew&#x27; factor by at least 90%.  I just ordered the single use 1 ml packs,  in case of need when away from home.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Just-Drop-Singles-Pack-10/dp/B003D0OCBW/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_4</li>
    <li> It does a nice job covering up the odor.  I have found three drops to be the best.  I can see traveling with this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I sometimes share rooms with my friends when I travel, and I loathe awkward situations, as well as stinky odors from the bathroom. I took our on a trip this past weekend, and the results were mixed. I explained to my roomie how the product works, and I must admit, it did fairly will, but it didn&#x27;t take one drop.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, perfect ! Works all the time, it&#x27;s easy to carry, and just need one drop. It&#x27;s perfect. 100%</li>
    <li> Used exactly as directed and felt that it just masked the smell with a REALLY fragrant potpourri fragrance, but wasn&#x27;t some sort of &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; solution...</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is a convenient product to use when traveling. The manufacturer is correct when they say it takes Just A Drop. No more unpleasant odors.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This stuff really really works</li>
    <li> Love having these little bottles on hand for travel use in public restrooms, works well @ home also</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was skeptical as to whether this product would work or not. Surprisingly, it worked very well, although, I&#x27;m not sure if only one drop would work. First of all, I found it difficult to get only one drop to come out. This is not a big problem and I would probably use 2 or 3 drops anyway. Now if I could only figure out a way to get my cat to use it, life would be great.</li>
    <li> It certainly smells like the blue stuff they put in port-a-potties but isn&#x27;t very noticeable if you really only use one drop. Use it BEFORE going, and flush. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I saw a commercial for Poo Pourri (very funny and clever) and though I &#x27;d search it out partly for the amusement factor. I bought this instead because of pricing and there were other good reviews. It DOES work fine. I am curious now to try the Poo Pourri compare. There is one scent factor in this product I don&#x27;t like. The initial scent I do but then the next wave I detect I personally don&#x27;t care for ; that is why I will eventually try another brand for comparison.</li>
    <li> Went on a retreat and took it along. Helped quite a bit!  Left it in the bathroom for everyone to use.</li>
    <li> Put a drop in the toilet after flushing and odors are gone. Don&#x27;t get other brands--they don&#x27;t work. Hope this stays on the market--not always available.</li>
    <li> Have been using product for a while and really helps! Will continue buying this product!  It is everything stated in advertisment!</li>
    <li> This product has a stinky odor of its own, kind of disinfectant/medicinal.  That combined with the poop odor - yuk.  Poo Pourri works much much better.</li>
    <li> If you have time to wait its great, but if your in a rush 2 drops will do the trick. Leaves the bathroom ready for next person going in.</li>
    <li> Just a Drop works very good and can be used before or during any movements.&lt;br /&gt;The dropper sometimes lets out too much but overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;We use it in 3 bathrooms.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to have if you have unexpected BM&#x27;s due to medical issues or for traveling. i highly recommend it. however it doesn&#x27;t mask gas.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because we are self conscience about using the restroom in public places.  Just a drop needs more than &amp;#34;just a drop&amp;#34; to conceal such odors.  If your looking to conceal odors, I recommend Poo-pourri which is also sold here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried it in a public bathroom a couple drops in the water and all I could smell is the just a drop scent I felt more at ease to go normally I would just wait. I will get more when I run out</li>
    <li> Even my husband likes this!  He hates sprays, and a lot of odors bother him, but this he can handle.  It came with a small holder that sticks to the top of the toilet lid, so it&#x27;s not easily knocked off.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this for over a year. Very good product and lasts a long time.  Pleasant scent. Does not overpower. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> It does seem to work, but really only use one drop.  I do not like the strong eucalyptus smell at all.</li>
    <li> works great for a powder room that adjoins living area. Also great for tucking into a purse in case you need it when you are out somewhere.</li>
    <li> The product is worthless.  Does not hide bathroom odors as advertised.</li>
    <li> Small enough to take in your purse.  Really works well! I also keep one in my bathroom off my familyroom.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0019SPNQ8 Just A Drop - The Natural Toilet Odor Neutralizer - 15 ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Used this product for the first time, and to sum it up in one word \\&quot;OW!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Water does not splash up all the time while using the facilities, but when it does this product will burn like battery acid! Beware!&lt;br /&gt;And again may i say \\&quot;ow, ouch, owwie, and never again\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The End[[ASIN:B0019SPNQ8 Just A Drop - The Natural Toilet Odor Neutralizer - 15 ml]]</li>
    <li> This works extremely well and has a very pleasant smell. I&#x27;ve used these for over a year and I have been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The elf left this for my husband in his stocking...and it&#x27;s great!  We don&#x27;t have to use TONS of bathroom spray anymore to cover up the toilet odor.  Great referral by Dr. Oz!</li>
    <li> Excited to finally have this! It works! :)</li>
    <li> thanks i enjoy doing business with you all,keep up the good work.the iitem was in good shap, every thing was on time</li>
    <li> One of the bottles was broken and leaked out most of the product.</li>
    <li> Even though a little over priced in my opinion, it was fun to have people get these in their stockings!</li>
    <li> THis stuff works as advertised.  I got it in a fast manner and began using it right away.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the 15 ml bottle is , in itself, little more than &amp;#34;just a drop&amp;#34;.  Would&lt;br /&gt;prefer a larger bottle.  Wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more if it would last longer !</li>
    <li> Great!  Works as Described.  As seen on the Dr. Oz Show.  Product works very very very very very very well.</li>
    <li> What can I say about this except that it works like a charm.  Great little product you won&#x27;t regret buying.</li>
    <li> It was a gag gift for a Christmas stocking from my daughter-in-law to my son but guess what? It works!</li>
    <li> While this doesn&#x27;t always work 100%, it certainly beats spraying those awful sprays afterwards.  I buy it in bulk now.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I keep one in each bathroom and one with me when I travel too. No more stinky bathrooms.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really neutralize as well as I would hope.  smells okay, but does not completely wipe out any odors</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a truly amazing odor neutralizer try this.  PS: it literally only takes a drop or two.</li>
    <li> Did not seem that effective.</li>
    <li> We have a bad problem with the office&#x27;s bathroom, I brought this product and no body complaint about the smells anymore.</li>
    <li> Works as described, but has a strong pine smell that I am not a fan of.</li>
    <li> Well one drop does not do it actually.  A few more works much better but then your using up the bottle twice as fast.  I sat several out at home and one at my work site and the very next day someone stole it out of the stationary stand stand at work.  Nothing is sacred anymore!  But would recommend this just buy several to place in mutliple bathrooms.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable, but this stuff totally works. Go ahead, use a drop and bomb the bathroom (flush) then invite a few housemates to stand in the freshly bombed bathroom to see how well it works. This stuff should be mandatory in every bathroom, everywhere in the entire world. Okay, maybe not that extreme, but my God, never be embarrassed by stinky bathroom time and small living quarters again.</li>
    <li> Saw this on Doctor Oz and had to try it.  Seems to work well at home.  I take a lot of weekend trips with my friends to run half marathons in different places.  I am hoping this works as well when there are 4 people sharing one hotel bathroom.</li>
    <li> A very good product to eliminate odor in the toilet. Great for travel when you use different toilets.</li>
    <li> These work just as claimed. I definitely would love to try some of the other scents available.</li>
    <li> Three drops didn&#x27;t even prevent odor. Disappointing..</li>
    <li> This product is everything one could ask for in eliminating embarrassing restroom odors.  One just needs to follow directions........no odor!  I will gift \\&quot; Just a Drop\\&quot; to my friends.</li>
    <li> This product works.  Saves a lot of bathroom spray.  One drop and odor is gone. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This product was referred to by via Dr. Oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an amazing product for bathroom odors.  I will definitely continue to purchase, use, and have around for use.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this product would work but it does!  I was amazed.  I bought 3 bottles and take it everywhere.  It avoids the embarrassment when you are out.  You can of course use it in your house but why waste it?  I highly suggest this product if you travel with others.  You can even give them a bottle!</li>
    <li> excellent. use it daily at the office.  However 1 drop is not enough you have to do at least 2.</li>
    <li> Works very good, I even use it in my cat litter, and it&#x27;s really just a drop. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on that like I did. This thing does nothing for me (or my poop). I use it as the directions suggest, still does not work. I can drop one, two or three drops, still doesn&#x27;t work. Bathroom smells like poop. The &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; smell lasts a fraction of a second, and the poop smell gets all over the place as if nothing had been done. Can I get my money back without paying for delivery?</li>
    <li> Love the fresh and clean scent and my guests don&#x27;t feel bad when they have to go to the bathroom. it is a lot better than potpourri spray scents!!</li>
