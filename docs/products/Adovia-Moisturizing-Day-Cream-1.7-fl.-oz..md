<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was not the best product for me. As I have sensitive skin. Made me break out pretty bad. Gave it to My step mom and she loved it though. Received this product in return for giving a review.</li>
    <li> This one ended up in the trash.  Tacky feel, didn&#x27;t like the smell at all.  Also the product box was dirty and dented. Looked like it fell off the back of a truck.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not a cream suited for those with more sensitive skin.  As soon as I applied it the first time, I started getting red bumpy blotches on my skin, it was also very itchy and I had to wash it off because it felt like it was clogging up my pores.  It smells very artificial and leaves skin feeling both dry and itchy. I was curious to see whether something else may have caused the adverse reaction I was having to this cream, but I experienced the same result on a second try. It&#x27;s really not worth it and I expect my money back!</li>
    <li> I liked this moisturizer ok, it has a great smell and it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy during the middle of the day like a lot of moisturizers do.</li>
    <li> I love the soft feeling on my skin after applying. Not greasy, and a very light pleasant scent. It seems a little goes a long way, so I expect this will last a long time, and I know I will keep the re-order info handy.</li>
    <li> I would recommend using the Adovia moisturizing day cream.  It  is a mineral based product to restore and renew itself.  It has a nice light fragrance and it looks thick but it is absorbed quickly and makes your skin feel smooth.  It does not make my face feel greasy which is wonderful .  Knowing that I am putting minerals for the dead sea and Aloe Vera and Chamomile just makes this moisturizer more exciting to use .*I did receive this at a reduced cost and these are my true and honest unbiased feelings.</li>
    <li> Great product. Only been using a week and my face is no longer dry but not oily either. Great smell too!</li>
    <li> This product was received as part of a promotional offer and I was asked to give my 100% honest opinion/review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this! I&#x27;m a skin care junkie and I&#x27;ve used Aveeno, Olay and Avon over the years. I am now putting Adovia above them all.&lt;br /&gt;The daily moisture mineral cream is very lightweight. It does not feel heavy or greasy on my skin. It blends easily, and really works well on your neck too.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this cream. Apply it just a bit at a time until you have moisturized your entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin this may be the product for you. No burning, itching, red patches. There are no dyes and no scent. This is always important to me as my skin tends to be irritated by many new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one product I will buy over and over again. This is right up there with Avon&#x27;s Anew products and Olay&#x27;s Regenerist products.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful, in my opinion . It helps my skin feel moist, clean and not greasy . Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels when I use this.</li>
    <li> This is my first product that I have purchased from Adovia. I am a bit picky and cautious when buying beauty products without seeing them in person first. That being said, I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I took the leap of faith, and purchased this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When I first received the package, I was excited to rip open the package and see my new cream. The jar is beautiful. It is frosted, and looks sophisticated. Holding it, I feel as though I bought it from a high end department store for a few hundred dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I couldn&#x27;t wait, and opened the jar right away. There is a small, plastic top, that is there to prevent the cream from spreading to the lid during shipment. Very convenient. It was easy to take off. Before touching it, I smelled it. It has a beautiful, almost powdery, smell to it. Light, yet fragrant. Nothing too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That night, I eagerly cleaned my face in anticipation for my new cream. I put a dab on my finger, and right away noticed how thick it was. I love that. If it is too thin, I wonder just how much of it actually penetrates my skin. I put just a bit on both my cheeks, and gently rubbed it in, going in circles. It spread very easily, and a little went a long way. I just needed a tad bit more to do my chin, nose, and forehead. My face felt refreshed, and moisturized. It didn&#x27;t have a horribly greasy feel. It dried fairly quickly, and I was able to lay down shortly after, without fearing that it would rub off onto my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;  The next night, I repeated the routine. It is so easy. Five minutes, tops, to leave your face feeling beautiful. After three days, my husband noticed a difference! The fourth night, I read that it would also make a great base under makeup. The next morning, I gave it a shot. I put on just enough to cover my face. Afterwards, my foundation spread on and covered better than it ever had! While I don&#x27;t have a huge concern about wrinkles yet, I did notice that the pores on my nose, were not as visible as they were without the cream under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;  That night, when I removed my makeup and cleaned my face, it felt so soft. Normally, my face feels a bit dry and tight, after wearing foundation all day. This was the first time I didn&#x27;t experience that!&lt;br /&gt;  This is now part of both my morning and nightly routines. I have recommended it to my mom, and friends. They are all eager to try it themselves! It is definitely worth the buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great all day, non greasy, facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been trying many Adovia products for almost a year now.  Some I like a lot, some a little disappointed in.  I find the day cream to be very thick and not slide on smoothly although it does absorb into the skin and does not leave my face feeling greasy.  I do wish it had a better fragrance.  I&#x27;m reminded of old lady perfume.  I will continue to use up the jar as I do believe it moisturizes well.  Unfortunately, I can never see a visible difference in my skin when I try new products although my mother recently mentioned to me that my face/skin looked nice.  This was after I was using this for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream is so soft and has a nice thickness to it, but not to thick. It absorbs so smoothly in your face. There is no over bearing smell to it. My face feels so refreshed and soft after putting this on, im not one to usually put creams on my face but lately my face had had done dry skin, not sure if it is me moving to the desert from a north eastern state, but anyways, my face looks and feels so much softer and no dry skin seen on my face when I wake up in the morning, I mostly put this on at night,  (Thank god, because sometimes I do not have the time to moisturize right away before dropping kids off at school, when im running around with kids all in the morning, making sure they are getting ready.) Also I only need very little to cover my entire face, so this jar will last a while.</li>
    <li> You can instantly feel results. It gives your face a soft, firm and georgeous look. I have been using it for a week and I love it. It also gives your make up a more glowing look.</li>
    <li> Adovia Moisturizer is rich and makes your skin feel wonderful.  It reminded me of a primer I&#x27;ve used in the past.  There is a slight scent that I did not find offensive, but perhaps might bother some.  I am familiar with the Adovia brand and am currently using their Sulfur Soap to clear up some midlife skin issues.  I&#x27;ve used the Dead Sea Mineral Soap and Facial Salt Scrub to name just a few.</li>
    <li> I loveeeee the smell of this moisturizer. My skin feels so smooth after applying this, and I simply love it!</li>
    <li> WOOHOO!!  FINALLY!!  I had the opportunity to review this product and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;m extremely about what products I put on my face. My skin is sensitive and I don&#x27;t have much luck nor satisfaction with facial skin products. I haven&#x27;t had a &amp;#34;GO TO - MUST HAVE&amp;#34; in years. I feel like as I&#x27;m getting older my skin just isn&#x27;t as responsive to products and/or irritates quickly.  I am happy to say that I have found my &amp;#34;GO TO - MUST HAVE&amp;#34; facial skin product. OMG I adore this cream. It isn&#x27;t too think and has a pleasant smell. It&#x27;s light and reminds me of my mother. Very refreshing. My skin hasn&#x27;t broken out once since I began using this cream. My skin is smoother, softer, and definitely more supple. It totally quenches my skin&#x27;s thirst. Love it!  I also think very highly of Adovia, the company that makes this product. I enjoy all of their products and appreciate their philosophies.  I highly recommend and will most definitely purchase again in the very near future!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this day cream! It never breaks me out, leaves my skin looking like it is glowing. I will buy this again for sure.</li>
    <li> Thick cream and I&#x27;m using as an evening moisterizer.  For a day time cream I&#x27;d want sunscreen protection added.</li>
    <li> Purchased for wife. Here&#x27;s her review: I’m so happy I decided to try this moisturizer. It’s thick, creamy, very hydrating and doesn’t leave your skin feeling greasy at all. The packaging is really nice as well. The jar is not very big but a little of this stuff goes a long way so it will last you awhile. I use it once a day in the morning. If you use it under makeup make sure to let it completely dry first. As long as it dries it’s a great base for under makeup. I really like that it doesn’t leave my face looking greasy or oily. I have combination skin and it’s great for that.</li>
    <li> I feel very comfortable to apply this moisturiser on my face.  It does not feel greasy.  This is suitable for a humid weather in my place.  Its scent feels very natural and fresh.  I immediately bought a dozen again for my relatives and friends use after trying my first order.</li>
    <li> USED ONLY ONE WEEK.....TAKES TOO LONG TO RUB IT IN ....TOO EXPENSIVE.......WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I have been using Adovia products for years. I used to have really dry cheeks but not since using this product. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on and off for years since it was named &amp;#34;Seaora&amp;#34;. It has always been that moisturizer that everythig else was compared to for me. It has been impossible to find for the past year and a half and was so excited to find that it is finally back. With that being said when I received it is seems the formula has changed. It&#x27;s a little heavier when you apply it (though it soaks reAlly well), it doesn&#x27;t travel as well (I have to use more), and my makeup seems to slide off now. Overall this moisturizer works  well, however I will be limiting my use on this as more of a night cream or on days where I go more &amp;#34;au naturale&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this moisturizer because of the fragrance it is to strong.  The moisturizer just ok as far as making the skin feel good and does need a sun block added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less fragrance and an SPF added and I would consider using it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing, my skin too soft and not dry as it&#x27;s used to be.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very thick; A pea sized amount of this moisturizer is just enough to cover the entire face. It has some good and beneficial ingredients, but it does contains some ingredients that are questionable. It gives my skin a nice softness hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer also is a good makeup base, in my opinion. It provides a smooth canvas for my foundation. I wish it contains some SPF properties. For the price, the jar should be a little bigger. However the thickness of this moisturizer and the amount that I use, the moisturizer should last me at 6 months.</li>
    <li> Began using it this week. Very rich mixture, feels like every pour is saturated without an oily or slick texture. Afterwards, skin feels very smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this cream for a few days before leaving a review. I think it&#x27;s great! Just the right consistency, no overbearing scent, goes on smoothly and easily. I had been using a &amp;#34;big name brand&amp;#34; moisturizer (which feels &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; or watered-down in comparison) and I think the Adovia is better. Time will tell, but so far I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> This product is the best and a good match with the eye gel which I have used for years..smooth and soft feeling, not greasy or sticky. Fragrance is fresh, I have sensitive skin and allergies and it does not irritate..the packaging is good..there is a covering inside of lid and expiration date on bottom of jar..important to me..I have used dead sea minerals for years and this will not disappoint..I have dabbed product on sun spots and age spots and they have faded and some are gone..Dead Sea Minerals are a 10 for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for 2 weeks now.  The texture is wonderful and I especially like the clean scent.  It makes my skin super soft and not greasy.  I took off a star because I think it leaves a white color on the face (like a sunscreen) and it doesn&#x27;t look good under makeup.  Also, there is no SPF in the product.  I will continue to use this as my go to night cream.</li>
    <li> I like this cream a lot.  It feels very thick but absorbs quickly in my dry skin. I also like that there is no heavy fragrance smell. It does say daily moisturizer but I think I may use it more as a night cream and us something else a little lighter as a day cream.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin.  This product is very moisturizing.  Made a great makeup base for me.  Not sure if it has a sunscreen so you would still need to add sun protection.  Smells great too. If it had sunscreen protection, I would have given it five stars.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer.  It has a very light fragrance.  It didn&#x27;t clog my pores and it really did help my dry areas.  I do wish it had SPF in it as the fewer steps I have to take in the morning the better.</li>
    <li> This cream seemed to work fine as a moisturizer however I really didn&#x27;t like the smell or the texture.  It reminded me of the cold cream my grandmother used to use.  I realize this could be personal preference and I am sure there are people who need a good thick cold cream.  I just didn&#x27;t love it</li>
    <li> I really like this face cream. It is moisturizing and soaks in quickly without feeling greasy. I have sensitive and combination skin and this cream works great. I like that it keeps my face moist for the whole day. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams in my life.  This little wonder helps my skin tremendously.  I have combination skin and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find the right one. Applying two or more creams to your skin to achieve the effects you need is tiresome.  With this cream i was able to apply to my face and neck with less time and less items on the counter. It goes on smooth and absorbs fast. I use it for my morning and night time regime.  It gives a soft effect to your skin. Instead of three item if you&#x27;re like me you can finally have one. Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> really helps with the dryness of winter air.</li>
    <li> I instantly fell in love with this cream when I applied it to my face. The best word I can use is luxurious! It is a thick, rich cream that soothes immediately. Warning- use a very small amount, less than a finger tips worth. A little of this cream goes a long way. I used just a dab and was able to massage it into my entire face and neck without grabbing any more product. The scent makes me think of high end department store cosmetics, in a good way. The jar is small, but since you use so little product at a time it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great!  It does not leave face greasy or thick and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This has been the perfect lightweight moisturizer for before I start my morning routine. It applies evenly and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel covered in gunk. I didn&#x27;t get any comedones from the product either which is a major plus.  I use it before applying foundation with no issue. I also find my face feels moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have seen these dead sea mineral products every year at the mall. I have no idea if they are any affiliation or not, but the products always seemed great, but a little pricey for what you get. I am obsessed with moisturizing my face,and always on the lookout for a new cream that will help combat the dry patches on my cheeks without irritating my rosacea, this did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;The benefits are:&lt;br /&gt;-Light. not greasy&lt;br /&gt;-didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts&lt;br /&gt;-didn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea&lt;br /&gt;-smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;-lightly scented for those with scent issues</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about breaking out from this cream at first because I have very sensitive skin...but, It worked beautifully and I really like the fragrance and hydration.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is outstanding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it after my toner and eye serum, at night, since it was my first use and I didn&#x27;t want to commit to going out in public if it made my face greasy but it didn&#x27;t at all. I *love* the scent, though I can&#x27;t place exactly what it is. It does last (lightly), so I can enjoy it for hours! The cream is VERY thick so you don&#x27;t need to use much at all to cover your whole face. It goes on so smoothly and almost feels like it melts into your skin - it has a similar texture to body butter, rather than your average daytime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once dry, it gave my skin a slight warming sensation which made me nervous because sometimes that changes quickly to burning. This did not. My skin has an actually SILKY feel to it and I know this would be the perfect moisturizer to wear under my loose-powder makeup. If my feelings on this change after prolonged use, I will definitely update, but for now this is my new favorite moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I love the texture of it. It is not too oily, but you can feel the moisture. I love it!</li>
    <li> Adovia has done it again! I am a fan of Adovia products they are pure liquid gold. I have dry skin and this daily moisturizer is a dream. You only need a very little bit and it goes a long way. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is has been PERFECT for both mine and my husband&#x27;s skin this winter!! Living in NY, our skin gets soooo dry during the winter months. This has really helped my skin regain that moisture that it was missing. It works great on hands &amp; feet too, especially before bed!! Great product for a great price. It&#x27;s also nice and light and not sticky at all!!</li>
    <li> Dionysia&#x27;s daugher-  I like this moisturizer a lot. It&#x27;s not my absolute favorite (my favorite being Deja Vu&#x27;s Dead Sea Minerals All Day Moisturizer, but that thing is like $100 and I only had it because I got it on some deep sale in the mall) but it definitely is up there. It&#x27;s very light weight, doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals or irritate my skin. It&#x27;s not quite moisturizing enough for my dry skin, so sometimes I put some raw Shea or coconut oil on the parts of my skin that are the driest.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, especially on my face. I started using this product and am seeing an amazing difference already. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and cannot use most products on my face.  However, the Adovia Daily Moisturizer Cream is the best I ever used.  I have combination skin and I thought the moisturizer would increase the oiliness around my nose, but it did not.  The moisturizer has a soft smell and melts into your skin.  This will be the only moisturizer in use.  I highly recommend this product and I am a woman of color.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has worked great for my face.  Many products irritate my skin.  This one seems very gentle, and keeps my face from drying out.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m really liking this daily cream.  It smells nice and is not oily.  I use it at night instead of during the day...I don&#x27;t wear moisturizer under my makeup.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars just because I haven&#x27;t used it enough to know if it will make a difference in my skin tone, wrinkles, etc.</li>
    <li> While I love some of the Adovia skin care products, I must say that I am disappointed with the daily moisturizer cream. First of all, it has a rather strong fragrance, and I usually try to avoid fragrances in skin care products because I am very sensitive to them. Also, the cream is thicker than I expected. It seems to work well enough, but I prefer something a bit lighter.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer for the daytime! It does leave your face very smooth so I don&#x27;t even use primer anymore. However, this may not be ideal for you if you have really dry skin or if you expect your moisturizer to have SPF.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer by Adovia.  I enjoy all of their products I have tried thus far.  Good clean, not overwhelming scent.  Goes on nicely and is not greasy at all.  Definitely would recommend. (I tend to have dry skin to normal skin)</li>
    <li> Way too thick for me.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for extremely dry skin and would say at this moment that it is doing the trick.</li>
    <li> I wish this company sold a gallon of this stuff. My face tends to get really dry and this is like i cant even describe it. I guess best way is its like having silk blanket on your face. It leaves it feeling so soft, not greasy and it looks nicer. Don&#x27;t take my word for it buy this and you wont regret it. If you know a picky guy that wont wear lotion because its too greasy or smells like perfume. Get them this and they will be really grateful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay because it doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out which is good. My skin is very sensitive. However, this cream smells like baby powder (yuck) and it goes on heavy and thick. It doesn&#x27;t mix right with my spf lotion or any lotion. It gets all flaky if I use it with any other product. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. :(</li>
    <li> Excellent, as always. Fabulous product! Really works for my Rosacea without breaking me out.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer cream was different than most creams I&#x27;ve used in the past. I have moderately dry skin, and I&#x27;m used to a glow after putting on moisturizer. This cream goes on very matte, it almost feels like your skin can&#x27;t breathe, but after a few minutes that feeling goes away, my skin felt very smooth and soft all day long even into the next day I noticed if I didn&#x27;t wash my face till Noon it still felt very smooth and soft. My make-up went on very nice with the matte look also.</li>
    <li> This cream feels and smells great. Not greasy, absorbs fast, not sticky, no residue feeling, and NO breakouts. I have fair sensitive skin. And this made my sunburn heal up three times faster than usual. I&#x27;ve loved everything of Adovia&#x27;s dead sea minerals products that I have tried so far. I highly recommend.  I may be hooked!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff makes face so soft. And it helps with acne</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product!  It arrived on time, boxed in a sturdy box to protect the product.  The actual packaging for the product is very nice.  The jar itself is of a very heavy frosted glass (to me that equals a bit more expensive, as it isn&#x27;t plastic).  The only issue I had is the lid didn&#x27;t twist securely on (luckily, I wasn&#x27;t travelling anywhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the jar a nice scent emerged.  It isn&#x27;t powdery nor floral smelling.  The best I can describe is it smells clean but in a very sublet way.  The cream is wonderfully thick and satiny, not greasy at all.  I use Mineral makeup and normally use a Primer, but this moisturizer almost had the same feel as my primer.  So, I stopped using my primer and only this moisturizer before applying my makeup (who doesn&#x27;t love having one less thing to do to beautify yourself?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST part of this product?!?!?!  My husband actually asked me what I was doing different, my skin had a glow.  I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have a very youthful appearance as it is. But for my HUSBAND a GUY, DUDE, MAN...part of the opposite sex that doesn&#x27;t notice things like this to notice and comment was amazing.  In addition to my husband commenting my MOTHER IN LAW (God rest her soul) said I had a glow and asked if I was pregnant (I AM NOT!!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion****</li>
    <li> I have come to trust the Adovia Brand because of it&#x27;s Dead Sea minerals infused products. Not only is this cream beneficial for healthy and supple skin, it also smells wonderful. I really like this daytime moisturizer. It leaves my skin very soft and not oily or sticky. The texture is almost sufle like and very white and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great moisturizer and it can be used for men and women.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and packaged well.  The moisturizer is thick, but not greasy.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for under your makeup.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  The package is rather large and seems as though it will last a long time.  I have fairly sensitive skin and it has not make me breakout in any way.  This is definitely my new favorite moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> Ahhhh!!! Heaven on my dry face! This soaks into my skin and doesn&#x27;t just sit there it actually works and hydrates my face! There isn&#x27;t a scent either which is even more ideal for me because I have sensitive skin! I recieved a sample of this to test and review!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week or so and already love it!!  It has a light scent and goes on a little thick, but absorbs quickly.  My skin feels hydrated and moisturized. I recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I have ever used.  I have porous oily skin on my nose and dry cheeks.  This moisturizer works really well on both of them.  My face skin has never felt healthier. - Lisa</li>
    <li> I have used the Adovia Daily Moisturizer for over a month.  I wear it daily under my normal foundation and makeup.  It is not greasy and goes on with a light, clean feel.  I am so pleased with the results that I am going to try other Adovia products.</li>
    <li> I bought the day and night cream together. The night cream is great, but the day cream is very thick&lt;br /&gt;and was streaky when foundation was added. If you don&#x27;t wear make up it would probably be a great moisturizer. Adding sunscreen just makes it worse.</li>
    <li> I love the way this moisturizer smells. It is very clean smelling and not over powering. It is an amazing product and makes my skin feel amazing. I would recommend this moisturizer to anyone.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful cream!  It is a nice addition to my facial regimen.  This company consistently produces a high quality product.</li>
    <li> This is so professionally packaged. From the inside to the outside of how you receive it. Where I am located we are in the transition of going from winter to spring and then back and forth. With using this it has helped me skin calm down. It is a thick moisturizing cream. It has a slight scent but nothing over powering. One this I like about this it is hypoallergenic free. With my skin sometimes sensitive to things I put on it. This has not given me any troubles. This company uses dead sea minerals and dead sea salt. I believe the salt that is put in there is absorbing any extra moisture in your skin. It is a thicker cream and if you are worried why not use this at night time and let it do it&#x27;t thing overnight. I don&#x27;t feel it is too heavy to wear during the day. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a nice appeal to it. The colors are a neutral white and silver top that make it nice for either a man or a woman. I personally loved this cream because I was in desperate need of hydration. I instantly could feel the relief my skin received once I applied it and it lasted until morning. I have quite a few different products for my combination skin and depending on the weather in this Midwestern area, my skin can be super dry to oily. Unfortunately, this extended winter we have faced has mad my skin dry and Adovia&#x27;s Daily Moisturizer Cream was just what I needed. I let my husband try it too because it has a nice package and I know my hubby is in desperate need of skin care. After a few days I could see a nice improvement but lol he was just happy that his face wasn&#x27;t so tight anymore! So there you have it a man and a woman&#x27;s opinion :) I was lucky enough to have a sample provided at a nominal fee.</li>
    <li> I love the Adovia products and while I can&#x27;t argue with this product&#x27;s ability to moisturize, I find myself avoiding it because of the fragrance.  I find it overpowering and it seems to linger.  Its not a light scent....its heavily perfumed to me.  Having that scent linger and so close to my nose has made me avoid using  it.  I think I would enjoy it much more if it were unscented.  It is a satisfactory make up base but would probably be a better neck cream as it has a tendency to be a bit heavy for day.</li>
    <li> This is one of the BEST facial creams on the market!  I am 47, and recently at a baby shower I was highly praised for the condition of my skin, supple, no wrinkles, and a healthy glow.  I don&#x27;t do anything to it, except occasionally exfoliate, and always apply the Adovia Day/Night cream after a shower.  Wrinkles and stretched skin come with age and dehydration.  Drink water, and use the best moisturizer, which in my very honest opinion is Adovia Day and Night cream.  It is a healthy product, more than kind to your skin, and as the years go by you&#x27;ll be thanking CleopatrasChoice.com for this amazing product.</li>
    <li> Another high quality product from the folks at Adovia! Softens without that greasy feel. Really soaks in!</li>
    <li> This cream is a very thick and rich product.  For me, a small amount goes a long way. It moisturizes my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all throughout the day.  I noticed that I don&#x27;t have to touch up my makeup and my face is not as oily in the t-zone area. This is great.  However, I noticed that it does not contain a sunscreen which I think would be a plus for a daily moistuizer.</li>
    <li> I got this product thru a group I belong to and I have only used for one week but can definitely say it has made a difference in my face already. Softer brighter, I&#x27;m very happy so far,  ado via has a very good line of products . I plan to try more.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin and felt no difference on my face compare to a store bought product.</li>
    <li> I got this discounted for a review and I am so sorry I am just now writing it! Its really hard to say if I like this product or not. I received it right as the weather changed and got warmer, and this is a thick cream including some chucks almost. So I really haven&#x27;t used it much. Now if my skin goes back to being dry as the desert this winter, then I will give it another go and them update my review!</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to test a facial moisturizer from Adovia.  I had never heard of the brand before but the moisturizer is made with Dead Sea Minerals that is supposed to last all day and be non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a white cream that comes in a jar.  I apply it after washing my face in the morning and before applying makeup.  The cream consistency is a little thicker than I normally prefer in a day moisturizer but I didn&#x27;t notice it was greasy at all and I think it did a great job of lasting all day and acting as a primer for my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fresh and light and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have generally been pleased with the quality of Adovia Mineral Skin Care products. This moisturizer is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: This thick white cream has a light flowery fragrance. I scooped out roughly two fingertips-full from the jar, which provided ample product to cover my face and neck. If you find jar moisturizers to be unsanitary, then this likely isn&#x27;t a great product for you unless you use a tool to scoop out the product. There is no SPF, which is a drawback for me. I tend to gravitate toward day products that include SPF to increase my sun protection. Remembering to reach for SPF is an extra step that is easily forgettable.  My make-up applied smoothly over this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Overall, I was happy with this product, but I don&#x27;t see it being a long-term staple of my beauty routine. For me, day products really need to contain SPF to streamline my morning routine. However, it works well for a lazy Sunday when I have no plans to venture outside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
    <li> Last month Adovia Mineral Skin Care sent me their Adovia Moisturizing Day Cream to review. It is a daily moisturizer that contains Dead Sea Minerals, natural oils, and aloe vera. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the cream the first week, due to how thick it was and how it felt on my face, but after a week or so and I saw the benefits from it, I absolutely fell in love with it. My skin is acne prone and this cream did not cause one break out, plus it cleared up any dry spots on my face. I really wish I would have took a before picture so you guys could see the benefits I got from this day cream. My skin has a new natural glow to it besides being softer then it ever has been. I really am looking forward to reviewing many more products from this amazing company,</li>
    <li> I love Adovia products, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the Dead Sea Minerals that they use in their products or what but I love the way they make my skin feel and the products smell so clean &amp; fresh.  I also really love their packing.&lt;br /&gt;I actually have to be really careful with moisturizers since I have really oily skin.  A lot of people think that when you have oily skin you don&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer but that can&#x27;t be further from the truth.  Us oily girls need moisture too!  If you pick the right moisturizer it can actually balance your skin out and it won&#x27;t want to produce as much oil which will result in your skin being less oilier.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, this Adovia Moisturizing Day Cream is good for all skin types, and it contains natural oils &amp; aloe vera gel for hydration that absorbs quickly, it&#x27;s non-greasy and lasts all day.  Plus, it&#x27;s hypoallergenic, dermatologist tested &amp; approved, all natural UV Protection, 100% CRUELTY FREE and Never Tested on Animals!  Love, love and love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of moisturizer cream because in the past the products I used left my face oily.  NOT THIS product!  LOVE LOVE the feel of my skin afterwards and through out the day.  I gave it a good 30 days before I wrote my review because I wanted to see what it would do.  I can honestly say my wrinkles are not as noticeable (maybe its just my wishful thinking) and my skin is so soft.  I feel like I&#x27;m feeding my skin nutrients it needs.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I first opened this product, I noticed a nice soft scent. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was that of baby powder, but defiantly a fresh scent. I noticed on my skin it was very thick, it&#x27;s not something I would recommend wearing at night. A little bit of this moisturizer goes a long way, and when your putting it on make sure to completely rub it in. I noticed on the back of the container it says, &amp;#34;ideal as a make up base&amp;#34;. This is exactly what I have found it useful for! Sometimes my skin will get dried out from using makeup if it doesn&#x27;t have some kind of moisturizing affect. When I put this on though, before I put on my makeup, I have noticed my skin does not dry out like before, thus making my makeup last longer. Even though its really thick it did NOT clog my pores which I also really liked. The only negative I have about it is that it is really thick, and does take some time to rub into your skin. I would have to say I would recommend this product if your looking for a excellent base for your makeup or just an overall day moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this as a free product, but this does not alter or change my opinion in any way.</li>
    <li> The cream comes in a thick glass jar and has a little rubber plug which was nice since the lid isn&#x27;t airtight. It&#x27;s super thick almost like a mouse, and isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and super moisturizing. The only drawback for me is the scent, it smells very strongly of soap, but it fades away after a few minutes. &#x27;Sides that, I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin, especially around my eye brows, and corners of my nose. Therefore I must use a moisturizer daily to help my skin not only look amazing, but also feel amazing as well. I have been using this daily since I got it in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is on the thicker side when it comes to lotions and such, however it is no where near the thickness of a body butter or anything. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency in my opinion. After washing my face, I apply 4 small dots of this all over my face, and quickly rub it in. I let it set for 5 minutes before I start doing my makeup or anything else. It absorbs quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy or slick feeling which I love. My skin looks fantastic once applied, and lately I find myself not wearing any foundation during the day, the moisturizer keeps my dry skin flake free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a moisturizer, and perhaps are like me and have dry skin, I give this my recommendation. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all, and it has not broken out my sensitive skin. Overall I am very pleased with this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free for my unbiased opinion. This product left my face feeling smooth, soft and moisturized. It was easy to rub in, absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave any sort of oily residue. I had to stop using this product however because the scent of it made my allergies go crazy. If you don&#x27;t mind a mild scent, this product works great. If perfumes makes you sneeze, don&#x27;t purchase this product.</li>
    <li> expected a lighter cream. this cream is thick.</li>
    <li> Love it, the only moisturizer I will use</li>
    <li> I was very lucky to have the opportunity to try Adovia&#x27;s Daily Moisturizer Cream free of charge. Both myself and my husband love how the moisturizer cream leaves our skin. I personally love the light scent of the moisturizer. I have tried other moisturizers in the past and have been very disappointed the the product. My main concern for my skin is that it looks and feels better after using beauty products. My main turn off when it comes to beauty products are product that leave my skin greasy or extremely dry. I also do not like heavily scented products. The Adovia Natural Facial Moisturizer is nothing like those products. I use the moisturizer in the morning after my shower and before bed. The moisturizer quenches your skin&#x27;s thirst with natural, deep hydration that lasts all day giving you a more radiant complexion. I am extremely happy with the results and my beautiful younger looking skin!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! My skin is flake free and my skin is even toned and smoother than ever! I&#x27;m actually going to order another one of these next week because I can&#x27;t afford to run out of this stuff! Thank you!</li>
    <li> First off, the jar lid does not fit the jar. Maybe just a one time glitch? As soon as I took the packaging off the lid fell off &amp; it will not screw back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the cream is very thick &amp; heavy. I have never worn foundation for that reason. I don&#x27;t care for that &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; feeling. I chose to use it at night &amp; it works as well as any night moisturizer I have used. The fragrance smells old - maybe from the lid not fitting.</li>
    <li> I have had difficulty finding a new moisturizer. I have sensitive and oily skin so the wrong moisturizer can cause my face to look like an oil slick or breakout like a teenager. This day cream that I received for my blog was awesome and my skin loves it! It has the faintest of scents that smells quite fresh. Just a little moisturizer really goes a long way and it blends seamlessly into my skin leaving it feeling hydrated, youthful, and soft.  There is no leftover residue or oils...just beautiful skin! It works really well as a makeup base and I have even been using at night. I have been searching for a new cream that is more affordable that my current brand and I have found it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Adovia daily moisturizer cream for 3 weeks. It goes on very smoothly and isn&#x27;t  greasy. However I haven&#x27;t seen any different in my skin. I wish I could have seen more results, but I will continue to use the rest of the jar I have.</li>
    <li> I do not like this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not creamy and light it feels almost like Vaseline when you put it on.  Very heavy</li>
    <li> I have combination skin... sometimes my forehead gets a little oily and I have a few dry patches around my nose and mouth. After using this moisturizer daily for three weeks or so, I noticed that the dry patches were much better! I didn&#x27;t notice much change to my oily zone, but it was no worse and I did not get any break outs. Overall, my skin felt nice and soft and well-moisturized. I&#x27;m really happy with my experience with this moisturizer! I received this promotionally for review but my opinions remain my own.</li>
    <li> I had the chance to try this product through Tomoson. The last two Adovia products I tried, I was really really REALLY annoyed that the packages weren&#x27;t sealed. This one was!!! Gold star for cleanliness, Adovia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like this day cream. It smells a little weird, but it&#x27;s definitely not greasy. My skin feels hydrated after using it, and I can tell I&#x27;m going to love it in winter. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky residue a lot of creams do. The formula is pretty thick - almost emollient-like. My one wish is that it had sun protection in it. Supposedly it has some natural UV blocking ingredients in it, but to be perfectly honest I don&#x27;t know how much I trust that claim. I&#x27;ve been pairing it with a sunscreen regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will probably replace my current moisturizer at night. Since night time is kind of when skin repairs itself, I think the extra moisture is going to make a huge difference. Plus, there&#x27;s no reason for me to use sunscreen at night....which my current moisturizer has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retail on this is $33 - again, a little high in my opinion, especially considering the jar is fairly small. I like this product. I&#x27;m not crazy about the price, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell. I&#x27;m also not sure I&#x27;d purchase this over other, cheaper moisturizers....but I will definitely use it.</li>
    <li> The product sells for $25.95 and I&#x27;ll start my review with saying that is the reason it received a 4 star rather than a 5 star rating. Despite the fact that I like this product, I would NEVER spend that much money on the small amount you get. I was given this product for free to review, so at least I didn&#x27;t have to spend the money :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product sporadically, as I&#x27;m not used to moisturizing in my daily routine.  Every time I used it, there was a noticeable difference. If I felt particularly dry one day, I&#x27;d put it on and I was still feeling good the next morning. It does spread fairly well, but if I were using this every day, the product would have lasted me less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very faint, but nice smell, which I appreciated and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling like there is oil or a residue on it. Another plus. If the product was less expensive or larger, I would be recommending this ou the wazoo to people I know, but for that reason I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you DO have the money though, it&#x27;s a great product and works!</li>
    <li> I used it in the morning after waking it up and cleaning my face. I love how it quickly absorbs into my skin and doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy oily feeling. I didn&#x27;t have to reapply as I did before with my other creams so that was a plus. The only complaint that I have with this cream is that is doesn&#x27;t have SPF in it. Sometimes I just want to moisturize and go and don&#x27;t have time to add sunscreen. It also has a mild scent that I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay I like it but I just couldn&#x27;t get what I would&#x27;ve liked to of gotten from that not saying anything wrong with the product I think it&#x27;s more my skin</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review for my blog and I really liked the cream itself, but my chin didn&#x27;t. I broke out in acne on my chin. I have weird combination skin so I think that&#x27;s why. My daughter used it since I couldn&#x27;t and loved it! She had no problems with it. It&#x27;s a nice, thick cream with minimal scent and it is absorbed quickly. It works good as a makeup base, like it says. I would recommend it to anyone without weird combo skin like me!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer isn&#x27;t bad but it is a great I don&#x27;t understand the five-star reviews.  Personally I don&#x27;t like the smell of it it smells really cheap and it definitely is not worth $30. I purchased this because of the reviews but now that I&#x27;ve got it I have to say the reviews must be fake because this moisturizer is not fantastic as I said it&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s definitely not great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been systematically working my way through the full Adovia line of skin care and hair care products in recent months, and I can honestly say there is not a single disappointing product in the bunch--they are all superior, in part because they all contain much-lauded Dead Sea minerals. This high-quality Adovia moisturizing day cream is no exception; it is soothing, gentle and absorbs quickly for a cream. (Gel formulas absorb even faster, but this moisturizer is intentionally thicker and denser than a gel).    My skin tends to be oily, but I recently switched my daily sunscreen to an anti-acne version that created uneven patches of dryness on my face (not an Adovia product; the sunscreen was from somewhere else entirely). The Adovia cream helped to soothe and alleviate these dry patches without irritation or redness, and it also did not lead to any pimples or blemishes. I appreciate this because other creams by other brands tend to clog my pores.    The product has a light, powdery scent I associate with elegant, high end cosmetics. I liked the scent but wanted to note in my review that it exists because some individuals prefer unscented formulas. I happen to prefer creams like this one which have a clean, pleasant, non-chemical scent.    In my area, summer is now turning to autumn, so I can shift from gel-based formulas to creams like this one to cope with the changes in humidity levels. A little bit goes a long way, so while the jar of day cream might look petite, it actually lasts quite awhile.    I know our reviews are not supposed to talk about packaging, but I have to note that I really like the design of the Adovia products. They look very classic and elegant yet modern.    On a final note, I received a full sized sample to review and I have given you my honest impressions of the product.</li>
    <li> As I put this cream to the test, I was pleased to see that it held up well in this thirst quenching heat I live in. My oils were definitely in control and saw less shine coming through. The cream consistency is more on the thicker side but it applies very light once it is applied to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a surprise to me, it did not clog my pores. I usually tend to break out very easily with creams with high hydration.  Also, as I continually used it everyday, I started to notice more balance in my skin and less redness in my skin when I took my make up off.  So big thumbs up for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely have fallen head over heels for this moisturizing cream.  I loved all the benefits it contains which come from the amazing ingredients that its made from. It really did work for my skin which makes me more confident it would work on any skin type. Overall, I really loved how light it felt on my skin even though it is a thicker hydrating cream.  A little cream will go a long way so I know this container will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Another awesome product from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Moisturizer Cream from Adovia. It has a thick creamy texture, non-oily and a nice lite scent. It has helped my dry flakey skin with the dry weather and can&#x27;t wait to see the benefits of this moisturizing cream when the cold, dry winter weather hits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container it comes in is sleek and has a nice feel. Great moisturizer for all skin types and is made using dead sea minerals, aloe vera, grape seed oil, and chamomile. It is hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s honestly all I can say for now. Other then I would 100% recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful day cream its very moisturizing and easy to work with. it makes for a excellent makeup base. Normally my face feels really dry no matter what brand of makeup I am using at the time . using just a small amount of Adovia as a makeup base makes my skin way less tight and dry. You do have to use a sunscreen because this cream dose not have a SPF in it . I received a sample to try to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> sent a jar of Adovia Day Moisturizing Cream to review. I can’t begin to tell you how many moisturizing creams I go through because they just don’t work for me. When I was younger I used ones that contained more oil because my skin was dry. Great thing about that was I never had a pimple until I got into my 30′s and my skin changed from being mostly dry to now more oily with small dry patches. Many moisturizers leave my skin feeling caked and after a day or two using them I have pimples. However I have been using the Advia Day Moisturizing Cream for about 2 weeks under my makeup and it works wonderfully. You don’t have to use a lot of the product, a little goes a long way! It’s quick absorbing, non-greasy and didn’t block my pores so no pimples for me YAY!!  The moisturizer is infused with Dead Sea minerals, all natural UV protection and aloe vera. Adovia Day Moisturizing Cream is hypoallergenic, dermatologist tested and approved. I only recommend products or services I use personally and for me they work.</li>
    <li> I love that this product feels non-greasy. A little goes a long way. I also use the sulfur soap and absolutely love this product line. My skin feels firmer and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in breakouts.</li>
    <li> The reason for the four stars is because my bottle was banged up pretty good INSIDE the Adovia box, so that gave me a little pause- the entire top of the bottle (the metal part) was crumpled in. It made me wonder about quality control. But the seal was still intact, so I decided to open the bottle and just use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cream itself- Adovia is great. The last few years I&#x27;ve tried lots of different skin creams (I live in Southwest Florida, so anything &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; usually grabs my attention), but I always wind up going back to the Adovia. Of course, the big draw back is that there is no SPF in it, but I think the chemicals used in sun protection might alter the chemistry of the cream. But it is sort of a pain to have to layer two lotions. But the Adovia is one of the few things that actually moisturizes and improves my skin without turning it into a grease-fest or a red, irritated nightmare, so I just deal with having to put sunscreen on over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s REALLY REALLY rich and nourishing, but not greasy or heavy. I have super sensitive skin, and anything other than lightweight lotions makes my skin break out. But usually the lightweight lotions don&#x27;t moisturize enough and I get dry, peeling skin. The Adovia is like a cool drink of water on a hot day- I use only a TINY bit, and my skin sort of drinks it in and plumps up immediately. There&#x27;s no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a very long way. If you&#x27;re in the market for a skin care product that moisturizes and nourishes and that feels rich and creamy but not greasy, give it a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  My skin is particular when it comes to skin care products.  Its been a long time since I&#x27;ve had a really good moisturizer that really worked well with my skin.  I love this product!  I&#x27;m a huge fan of Adovia products all around but this one really hit the mark.  I was surprised at first.  As a day cream, its pretty thick right out of the tub.  But it absorbs super fast and once it does, my skin feels amazing all day long.  Its not greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel thick on my face.  I can even put my makeup on over it within minutes of applying it so I can still use it in the morning when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  My skin is super hydrated, soft and looks and feels great! I would use this again and again!  Read my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, creamy, non-greasy and easily absorbed moisturizer. The packaging is extremely high quality with a nice  frosted glass container. I had a couple of persistent dry patches on my cheeks that went away in 2 days after using this cream. It didn&#x27;t interfere with my make-up application at all. It has a nice fragrance that dissipates quickly. It didn&#x27;t cause any clogged pores or breakouts. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I ran out of my daily moisturizer, so I decided to try this product from Adovia.  I was impressed.  My previous moisturizer was $125 from an expensive skin care store, but this moisturizer is just as good if not better and so much cheaper.  It is not harsh on my skin and it has a pleasant smell. I have sensitive skin and it does not bother me. I would recommend this again and again.</li>
    <li> Great. I have dry skin and this help alot.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moisturizer Facial Cream with Premier Dead Sea Minerals  as my daytime moisturizer for two weeks now and I am very happy with the results!  I love Dead Sea mineral products and have tried many different kinds, this one is definitely in my top favorites.  My skin looks considerably smoother and supple; I even got compliments from my co-workers and friends on how my skin has been glowing lately!  It also dries fairly fast which is crucial for my morning routine, but it definitely provides enough hydration to last all day as well as a great base for makeup.  I will definitely continue to use this as a part of my daily daytime regimen!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream now for about a week and I do like it a lot. It is really thick but you don&#x60;t need to use a lot and it soaks in and it isn&#x60;t greasy at all. My face is very soft and smooth and even feels tighter.</li>
    <li> First impression is not favorable. Will give it  a little more time &amp; see if it grows on me. I didn&#x27;t find it particularily moisturizing and the scent is too strong.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing cream. I only gave it four stars because I wish it had moisturized a little bit better. It goes on heavy but quickly dissipated into the skin making it feel soft and smooth. I actually really do like this product. Will use it again definitely</li>
    <li> Like it very much because it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This cream is really thick - reminds me of sunblock consistency and takes a bit of rubbing in to fully absorb into the skin.  It reminds me more of a night cream than a day cream.  There are a lot of beneficial ingredients in it and it does feel protective, although I would need to apply sunscreen on top of it during the day and it feels very heavy already..  What I don&#x27;t really enjoy is the scent - it has a powdery old lady smell that takes a while to dissipate.</li>
    <li> I got this to try. I have had the chance to try out a lot of Adovia products and every time I am blown away.  There Dead Sea Mineral product are completely awesome.  This was a nice thick lotion that just soaked right into my skin.  It did have that very specific Dead Sea smell.  It is not a bad smell but there is just nothing else like it.  I was amazed at how soft my skin felt after just one use.  It did not leave me greasy at all and soaked in like a dream.  My pores were noticeably smaller after just one use and my skin just got better and better as I keep on using it.  I did not even go through that usual two weeks where you break out from using something new.&lt;br /&gt;  Adovia has a wide range of beauty products for you every day use.  The soaps, shampoos and lotions I have used have all been absolutely wonderful.  I love that everything contains Dead Sea minerals or Mud.  I also love that the prices are awesome it is hard to find Dead Sea products that are a reasonable price and they offer a wide range of these products at a price you can afford.  I would recommend them to everyone</li>
    <li> I have tried two other Adovia products and absolutely loved them! I was given the opportunity to review this product (with a free jar) and was not disappointed. I love the non-greasy feel, the faint fragrance, and thickness of this day cream. My face is left feeling clean and hydrated, not oily. This cream absorbs into my skin quickly with just a small amount is needed to cover my entire face. I highly recommend any Adovia product and this is my line of choice for my skin care needs!</li>
    <li> I got this product to test and review from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite excited when I heard about this product. I needed a moisturizer to add to my daily routine. I needed something that made my skin feel soft, clean, without making it oily and feeling heavy. When I was accepted into this promotion to receive this product, I started looking into the product, what it was made of, the ingredients, advantages. I was happy to see what I came across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product my face felt clean and the moisturizer went on smooth and didn’t leave any left over oily residue, like most moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started using this product on everyday basics. I prefer to use it as a base before I put on my make-up, in the morning. I notice it adds a smooth glow to my face and makes that morning look disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the moisturizer I feel more convenient, I even noticed that at night when I wash my face and head to bed, my face it much smoother and looks cleaner and refreshed, then I ever noticed before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this product daily, and I have shared this product with many friends, family and co-workers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some remarks I’ve heard: “Your face looks so smooth.” “Your complexion is amazing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is one that I highly recommend. I was happy that the product does NOT test on animals and is also hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> I was ecstatic to read that it was ideal for under makeup use.I didn&#x27;t realize how GOOD of a makeup base! I&#x27;ve used so many moisturizers that were too heavy and just melted away throughout the day. Its also hard to find one that work with mineral powder foundation.&lt;br /&gt; I use several different mineral powder foundations and before this my skin always looks a little matte and drab. With this my skin looks moisturized, cared for, and beautifully dewy! It&#x27;s practically near impossible to have even a semblance of dewiness when using a mineral powder foundation! People started complimenting my complexion and my face no longer felt tight or dry. I don&#x27;t even have to exfoliate as often. I must say that in my complete honest opinion this is the BEST moisturizing day cream I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt; I use this in combination with the Adovia Dead Sea Facial Cleansing Bar and the exfoliating dead sea salts and it&#x27;s a great combo. Adovia has some pretty amazing products and I simply can&#x27;t wait to build on my collection of their skin products!!</li>
    <li> I am using this facial cream since 2-3 weeks. This cream has very good scent and has thich and rich texture. It gets abosrbed well in skin and is bit thick in texture. I really love its scent and that&#x27;s one of the reason that I apply this cream almost daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it keeps my skin hydrated for a long time. I am not sure whether my skin glows after its usage but I can say that it keeps my skin moisturized and scented. It also keeps my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moderate skin neither oil nor too dry and this suits perfectly to my skin. In a nutshell , I really loved this cream and would recommend this product to everyone. I tried but couldn&#x27;t find any areas of improvement in this product.&lt;br /&gt;I got a product for free for review purpose.Opinions expressed are 100% of my own and not influenced by anyone.</li>
    <li> Adovia products are awesome.  I&#x27;ve used the Adovia mineral black dead see mud soap, and mask.  Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice is the best place to purchase as their customer service is fantastic as their products.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and works well under makeup</li>
    <li> I used the product for about two weeks. I realize that&#x27;s not a long time to test a product; however, I could not tolerate the heavy fragrance. Not sure why that&#x27;s ever necessary. Also, the dead sea salt that drew me to try this product was the last ingredient. And, I was not happy that the top did not screw on, it felt cheap.</li>
    <li> I love it, the smell wasn&#x27;t all that great, but it does the job wonderfully! :)</li>
    <li> I use their facial bar soap and love it so I wanted to try their day time moisturizer.  I love it.  My face does not break out and it feels good on my skin.  Not oily, not heavy, blends in and really hydrates my face.  They recommend this product as a perfect makeup base and it is!  I love the price too.  So reasonable!  I think this is a miracle in a jar!</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Great under make up. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I am more than pleased with all Adovia products I have reviewed.  This moisturizer is no exception.  It is a nice thick, kinda whipped cream.  My sister and I both think it smells good.  My face feels soft, but not greasy.  I have noticed I use less foundation, because it glides on easier after applying this moisturizer.  I would most definitely recommend this to family and friends.  Vicki</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this product. It comes very nicely packaged in a jar and you get a good amount of product also (1.7 fl oz). It is very creamy and hydrating yet light and non greasy. It absorbs very quickly and leaves skin feeling soft and supple. I also didn&#x27;t have any issues with it breaking me out.  I love the fact that it is all natural and has no harsh chemicals. I know this review seems short, sweet and to the point, but I honestly can&#x27;t think of anything bad to say. This is a very nice moisturizer that serves its purpose and has wonderful benefits.</li>
    <li> Just like the weather, my skin is constantly changing, so I’m always searching for products that can meet my issues. I often have 10-15 products in my skincare routine, as my skin can change almost daily. Because it’s still summer, most of my face is in fairly good condition, but my nose and chin continue to plague me with oil issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the opportunity via Tomoson to try Adovia Natural Facial Moisturizer, I was really excited. I love that the product is made using dead sea minerals; it also contains aloe vera, grape seed oil, and chamomile. It is hypoallergenic, dermatologist tested, and is for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the container, I was relieved to see a plastic stopper on top. This is something many companies overlook, but can often prevent spills and leaks during shipping. (I tend to save these as well, just in case I decide to travel with product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer had an ocean-like scent. It was light and very clean, which I enjoy. This cream is also very thick. A pea-sized amount was ample to moisturize my entire face. This means that the jar will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed using this moisturizer and have continued to do so for the past couple of weeks. It hydrates my skin without feeling heavy. I also do not notice any increased issues with oiliness, which is important for combination skin. It leaves my face feeling smooth and is great for application beneath my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with Adovia, but I am excited to check out more products in their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer was easy to apply and went on smoothly with no greasy feeling left on my skin. I noticed a softness in my skin to the touch and a brighter complexion while using this product too. It takes only seconds to apply, leaving you time to do other things and does not drip or run while using it. I received a free sample for review purposes and was thrilled with my results. I could see the difference myself, but really knew it was working when others commented about the glow to my skin. There is a mild scent to the moisturizer, but nothing overpowering or disturbing in any way. I would suggest this is you are looking to soften your look and add a youthful shine to it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  I really like that it absorbs so well into the skin and doesn&#x27;t a greasy film behind.  It goes on quite thick but spreads well and leaves the skin feeling great!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer, it&#x27;s nice and thick. Has a great smell.  I am only giving it 3 stars because I feel like there should be more product in it for the price.  I use it daily and it has only lasted a few weeks.  Usually when I purchase higher end items they tend to last a little longer so I feel like I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth...</li>
    <li> My review: I am finicky about what I use on my face and I have always been. Everything always dries it out and I end up continually having to put it on all day long every couple of hours.  I remember when I was 16 and found a moisturizer that I loved called &amp;#34;Deep Magic&amp;#34;(anyone remember it?)and they discontinued it. I went into a panic and drove all over town scooping up all the ones I could find on the shelves at all the drugstores in town. It was crazy making behavior but I tell you this story to demonstrate how important it is to me when I find one that works(and very few do). This one is a good one. Has a great aroma to it. Not &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; smelling. I put it on one time and I am good for the rest of the day. Makes my skin feel soft and supple. It makes my skin glow. Give it a try.....you&#x27;ll love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this cream for free for my personal opinion. All opinions are mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cream !! I have long had dry skin and dry facial skin at that. It&#x27;s difficult when you&#x27;re trying to look and feel your best when your makeup highlights your dry skin. Most creams don&#x27;t work so well for me and this one was a dream! I love how lightweight it is and that it does not make me feel greasy and gooey after applying it. This cream was great for my sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother me one bit. I love that my face feels moisturized and smooth after applying. No more flaky makeup or itchy skin for me. This cream is definitely staying part of my daily routine!</li>
    <li> This cream is very moisturizing. It is thick and applies on smooth to the skin. I use it before my makeup. It gives my skin a wonderful finish and a great base for the makeup. This cream smells amazing. It is not too harsh, but just right. I did not need to use much of the cream to apply because a small amount spreads evenly over the skin. Immediately after applying I did notice my skin looking plump and felt hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for nearly 3 weeks now. My skin is soft and supple. It is hydrated and feels amazing. It also absorbs into skin right away and leaves skin non-greasy. My skin has a natural glow and just overall smooth.</li>
    <li> This cream has a strong fragrance which I didn&#x27;t like. Otherwise it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. A little goes a long way since it is a thicker cream. The packaging is really nice and high quality.</li>
    <li> Ok. Now, not that I am shocked in the least, but Adovia has done it again! Leaves my skin so baby soft, non greasy, and a very light scent!</li>
    <li> I Stared using this moisturizer cream a few days ago and I am realling enjoying they way my face feels after I use it. Most moisturizers do not agree with my skin type and my rosicia and this daily moisturizer goes great with both and does not leave a nasty film after. Going to get my husband to try it out also!</li>
    <li> Daily Moisturizer has help my skin look like as if I was wearing some kind of shimmer make up, I usually look dead and my skin dead or as if I am sleepy but the cream aure works when used after the Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels like if it was going to be sticky and make my face go so hard but it hydrates and does not feel like glue as I though.&lt;br /&gt;The little jar is very pretty and fits almost everywhere. Definitely recomend it, I am an Adovia fan as far and have never heard of before.</li>
    <li> i like everything about it...face feels smoother  i may reorder unless i find something else i want to try...i am not loyal to face creams as i am always looking for something better</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great for dry skin. It keeps the skin hydrated all day without feeling greasy. It has virtually no scent and is beautifully packaged.</li>
    <li> My skin is quirky. It&#x27;s dry in some places and oily in others. After using this moisturizer  for a week or so I&#x27;ve already noticed an improvement. My face is more even. Your skin feels awesome while you&#x27;re wearing it. It&#x27;s safe to wear under your makeup and hasn&#x27;t broken out my sensitive skin. For me this is a huge bonus. Overall it&#x27;s a wonderful product that I look forward to using every evening. Sample provided for review. All opinions stated are those of my own.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer leaves your skin silky smooth without feeling greasy like other products. It has a pleasant smell and helped me get rid of dry patches!</li>
    <li> I dislike the smell of the product.  Please, remove the smell and make it fresh, clean, and citrus smell.  I had gotten this on a personal deal and I now regret buying.  The smell of this product line smells like old lady perfume.  Buyers beware.</li>
    <li> Mine is a ultra dry skin and my hunt for a good moisturizer for years was so painful and expensive and always ended up with something very greasy and only lasts for a couple hours. One day I heard about dead sea salts and was searching for the same on the internet. I saw Adovia products. Though the products were little expensive, I read through all the reviews about their products. As I was so desperate for a good moisturizing product, the amazing reviews had a positive impression on me and I wanted to try one last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up ordering Adovia Day moisturizing cream and Adovia Mineral moisturizing soap. (I always preferred glycerine soaps due to my dry skin, but this was the first time I ordered a non-glycerine type soap). What to say next, my experience was real amazing and I decided that is the product for me for rest of my life. The cream is not greasy at all. Get absorbs into the skin quickly and don&#x27;t block the pores too. I dont have to reapply for the whole day. And here is the greatest observation, my skin improved literally well in just one week and I can see the wrinkles healing, though slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always order Adovia products on Cleopatra&#x27;s choice website an they give 3 samples for orders &amp;#62; $25. So I tried other products as well - Adovia hand cream, night cream, dead sea salts soap, dead sea mask (this is the best and I took a one tube to India and my folks really loved it) etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Adovia. Your products are really amazing. Someone dont have to believe me, they have to try themselves to start believing in themselves. Its already 4 years and my whole family uses only adovia products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry forgot to tell you one more thing. My mom-in-law have some black marks on her face due to some allergic reaction for more than 20 years and nothing helped her. But she tried Adovia for a week, when she was travelling with us, though not intentionally to heal her dark spots. But her results were the long persisted issue started to heal and she started seeing those dark spots fade and dissappear into the skin, well I ended up ordering for her all the time now. Im glad it helped her.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this was perfect for what I was looking for. It hydrated my rough patches without a leaving a greasy feeling. My skin feels velvety smooth after applying.  I use twice a day, once in the morning before applying my make-up and at night after washing my face. It has a very light, appealing scent that I love. I bought this on promo and it&#x27;s just as comparable to the high-end moisturizers you find at the big name department stores.</li>
    <li> I have only used this moisturizer for almost a week an I absolutely love it, it absorbs into your skin an no greasy feeling your face feels like a babies bottom</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that always gets dry and flaky patches mostly on my chin, around my nose, and my forehead. This stuff was pretty good. It was VERY thick. It has a light, fresh scent to it. It took a bit of time to completely absorb into my skin so you probably would want to apply it at least 30 minutes before you apply your makeup. I did experience a breakout the first few days I used this but that is to be expected with any new product you introduce to your skin. It definitely hydrated my skin though and added a nice dewy glow to it without looking overly greasy. It&#x27;s definitely going to be a great moisturizer during the winter! *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> *Love*... I pair this moisturizer (daily) with the Sea Salt scrub (every other day) and the skin on my face came back to life by the second day of use.  Smooth, bright, and toned back to a level of healthy that I haven&#x27;t seen in a while.  This moisturizer is fantastically rich and creamy and melts right into my skin, I&#x27;ve even started using it on my hard-working, dry hands - I&#x27;d bathe in it if I could! You may have the same experience I did with it seeming greasy at first but this went away for me after day 2. Maybe using the salt scrub in conjunction with it helped take away layers of &amp;#34;ick&amp;#34; so that this could absorb better into my skin. I started both at the same time so I&#x27;m not sure but in any case, I am glad that I have this and can&#x27;t wait to try more products!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Adovia moisturizing day cream. I feel my skin nourished. I have started using it at night as well, just because it feels so good. I will definitely continue to. Use it. I have been using several of Adovia products. I feel they are safe for my skin and it is very easy to do business with them.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to try out this Adovia Face Moisturizer. She told me she needed to get a new face moisturizer anyway. She was happy when she learned she had a chance to review the product. She tried out this moisturizer and she was amazed. She is used to using the expensive stuff and this worked much better. It is easy to use and it makes her face feel wonderful. After she is done, her face is smoother and feels softer. She also loves the soft scent, it smells good to me too. We received this product for free, but the views are our own. This product is better than any my wife has tried so far.</li>
    <li> It seems, no matter what the season, I always have dry spots on my face.  However, with my combination skin, I am very hesitant to use moisturizers because I have had products increase acne and cause worse skin troubles for me than any help they might have provided.  I am also trying to avoid the chemicals and additives that so many cosmetics contain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I have been introduced to the Moisturizing Day Cream by Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This non-greasy cream absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and healthy.  After a couple of weeks of use, the dry spots have gone and my skin is now healthy and clear.  A lightweight cream, I do not feel as though it is thick or pore clogging as some products can be, but instead leaves my skin fresh and hydrated.  The moisturizing lasts all day long and I have noticed increased benefit after my extended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Containing an active complex of Dead Sea Minerals, helpful for natural moisture balance, I don&#x27;t worry about the chemicals in this product like I do with others on the market.  Tested and approved by dermatologists to be safe for all skin types and hypoallergenic, I am also confident that this product is a good choice.  Another feature I love is that there is not a fake or chemical smell to the cream, but instead it is a fresh scent that does not irritate my sensitive sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am recommending my friends and family check this moisturizer out, and I recommend it to you too!  You can go get your own here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  My husband, my daughter and myself have dry skin very badly during the winter months.  I loved that this moisturizer wasn&#x27;t extremely greasy or heavy and that the scent was light.&lt;br /&gt;It has really helped our dry skin over the past few weeks while we wait for winter to end.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and tend to break out in hives when I use creams.  At first I was a little nervous to try this cream due to my sensitivity. I have been using this for a while now and I love it. A little goes a long way. My face has been very red and extra dry from the winter. I love how when you put it on it doesn&#x27;t leave a a heavy feeling on your skin. It feels like you have nothing on your face and leaves no oily residue. After using this product for 3 days I saw a big difference in my skin. The redness started to go down a lot and my skin was smooth and started to look healthy again. I also have severe asthma and can&#x27;t handle a lot of perfumes. One thing about this cream is that it has a nice light refreshing scent. It&#x27;s very mild and smells really good. I would highly recommend giving this product a try. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very creamy but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin or make you look greasy at all. I really enjoy using this moisturizer because it makes my skin feel so soft and refresh. To be honest sometimes I even use it at night because I love how it makes my skin feel. I totally love it because it&#x27;s very moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t make me look shiny or greasy at all. The packaging is also very nice, it&#x27;s made out of glass which keep the moisturizer cool. Both male and female can use this product. Overall this is a great moisturizer and I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> It can be quite a challenge finding an all day moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too greasy or thick. I need something light enough that it can be worn under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I was chosen to try this product for free in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;Many times I find that my foundation can dry out my face especially the powder I use. I have been looking for something to give my face moisture without it being greasy and effecting my makeup. The day after I received this I used it for the first time. The first day I was going to be home all day so I didn&#x27;t put any makeup over it. The cream comes in a big jar so it will last you some time. It is thick and rich and rubs in fairly easily. My skin stayed baby soft throughout the day and didn&#x27;t seem greasy. The next day I was going out so I gave this cream the real test, weather it was usable or not underneath my foundation. I made sure it was absorbed really well which took awhile then applied my makeup over it. I noticed that with the moisturizer base my foundation seemed to go on easier and coat more evenly. My skin stayed hydrated for the remainder of the day and seemed to create a barrier between my foundation and skin, which made my face wash easier at the end of the day. Some pretty good stuff. I use daily.</li>
    <li> So far I am very happy with this moisturizer. I have only used it a couple of weeks, but so far so good</li>
    <li> My face is really dry, especially during the winter up here in ohio. This is a really great face moisturizer. It kept my face hydrated well. it wasn&#x27;t greasy like a lot of other moisturizers. It absorbed well but still kept my face quenched in the dry cold. I am happy to recieve this to review.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Helps with everything possible.  I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> This cream really works wonders for those difficult dry spots. I burned my skin badly enough to cause blisters a long time ago, and those spots are almost impossible to keep moisturized. This cream is really doing a great job. Good packaging, great service and information from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have super dry elbows, hands, knees and feet. After quite some time of using this my elbows are finally soft and no longer have that dark tone to them from the dry spots. My hands, knees and feet also look and feel amazing. I like the light fragrance this has and how it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
