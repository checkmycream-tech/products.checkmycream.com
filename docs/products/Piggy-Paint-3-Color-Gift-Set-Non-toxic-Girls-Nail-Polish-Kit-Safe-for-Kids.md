      <li>I have a feeling we&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
      <li>The purple color has this wonderful shimmer to it and is now the only color we use!</li>
      <li>I love that there&#x27;s no odor.</li>

      <li>I do love the idea of safe, fume free nail polish.</li>
      <li>This was a great gift for my 3 year old niece!</li>
      <li>but I was happy to accept it for the sake of its natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>and I like that it comes off easy.</li>
      <li>it is so non toxic it wears off easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So easy to remove from unwanted areas</li>

      <li>These colors are a super cute set too.  </li>
      <li>I love that there are no harsh fumes and its safe for my daughter!</li>
      <li>but it is a huge pain to take off her toes.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I got this for my 2.5 year old daughter because I loved the color options.  </li>
      <li>The only good thing is that the packaging and colors are really cute.</li>
      <li>Dries quick and doesn&#x27;t chip easily for being &amp;#34;natural as mud!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Thank you for this fun product!</li>
      <li>My 2yr old daughter loves having her own polish.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long, but great alternative and great for kids since it dries so fast.</li>
      <li>I have her hold the blow dryer (on cool) on her toes between coats and it gives her something to do.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these because my toddler is always asking to paint her nails, and I figured this would be a safe alternative to using real nail polish.</li>
      <li>Sweet colors.</li>
      <li>and I love that it comes off after some washings so no need for too much chemicals to remove it.</li>
      <li>set is great, a good true pink, a fun purple, and a funky blue, all with some shimmer to them.</li>
      <li>It dries fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>The blue in this set is really bright and fun.  </li>
      <li>I love the colors and I love being able to paint my child&#x27;s nails without having to worry about harsh chemicals!</li>
      <li>vivid color, kids love it</li>
      <li>The down side is that the polish chips very easily and after two days most of the polish has come off.  </li>
      <li>so I think it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
      <li>The purple has good coverage and actually some shimmer that even my daughter noticed and appreciated.  </li>
      <li>Still use the 2 bottles that survived and still having fun with them.</li>
      <li>(Even though this is a more natural product, I still don&#x27;t want them ingesting it</li>
      <li>polishes that are in fun colors.</li>
      <li>This polish comes off right after applying.</li>
      <li>but it comes right off.</li>
      <li>I think they are real cute colors for a little girl.  </li>
      <li>The colors are very bright and don&#x27;t have the typical chemical smell of adult polish.</li>
      <li>(toes included), I would paint them pretty colors.</li>
      <li>I think it is pretty harmless for a cosmetic product</li>
      <li>does not last more than one hand washing cycle.</li>
      <li>i was so glad to finally find something non toxic to use on my grandchild&#x27;s nails.</li>
      <li>Pretty colors though.</li>
      <li>I only wish they had a better selection of stickers.</li>
      <li>Tested them on myself first and the first time I washed my hands the tips started to chip.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was trying to avoid by purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend getting the top coat/base coat from Piggy Paint: http://www.amazon.com/Piggy-Paint-Gift-Make-Last/dp/B00CS3T4PY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1427918826&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;piggy+paint+top+coat</li>
      <li>I love that these are safe for small kids, and have been amazed at how well they wear.</li>
      <li>My 2.5 year old was so excited to use these colors.</li>
      <li>bottles of polish say to use with piggy paint base and top coats for best results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was a &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; with my daughter. We especially like that it&#x27;s non-toxic and the fun colors!</li>
    <li> I wish I was able to contact the seller but they refer all returns to the general amazon process. Other sellers had a place I could contact them and let them know when things like this happen. This is the second time I have ordered this and had it show up with the containers leaking and the polish dried. The box it was in did not appear damaged at all. The one out of six bottles that had usable polish in it seemed very nice. My daughter loved it. I tried to order more so she would have the other colors but all those bottles were dry. Bummer.</li>
    <li> My second set of nail polish for my daughter... piggy paint is my choice for kids nail polish!  Odorless and color wont stay too long, easy to remove.</li>
    <li> This polish does not dry quickly at all and is super thick. For the price and inconvenience you are better off painting a 2 or 3 year old&#x27;s nails with some 3free or 5free nail polish that does not contain formaldehyde donors or toxic chemicals but will dry faster than this stuff. One coat with the regular nail polish dries in less than half the time. This purchase was a waste of money. I am surprised at all the positive reviews!</li>
    <li> Grand daughter loves thes</li>
    <li> The purple color has this wonderful shimmer to it and is now the only color we use!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her Piggy Paint so much that it&#x27;s our go-to gift for her friends. Great selection of colors and easy to apply. Love that it&#x27;s non-toxic and easy to remove too. I only wish they had a better selection of stickers.</li>
    <li> Great packaging, just as pictured!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love to use this nail polish on my four year old, and as CRAZY as it sounds let her paint my nails which ends up being my fingers and toes, instead of nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy to remove from unwanted areas but does a great job staying on nails.</li>
    <li> I do love the idea of safe, fume free nail polish. This polish does, as others have stated, come off very easily even with the top coat and base coat. You just have to decide if it is worth it to you to take the time and effort to paint your child&#x27;s (or your nails) and have it come off in a few days. I love the colors and I love being able to paint my child&#x27;s nails without having to worry about harsh chemicals! Just be aware that you will have to repaint the nails fairly often if you want the polish to stay on for an extended period of time!  I would definitely recommend getting the top coat/base coat from Piggy Paint: http://www.amazon.com/Piggy-Paint-Gift-Make-Last/dp/B00CS3T4PY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1427918826&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;piggy+paint+top+coat</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Piggy Paint for years, both for me and for my kids.  I purchased this set and the top/base coat set for my daughter&#x27;s 3rd birthday.  She loves having painted piggies!  The blue in this set is really bright and fun.  My 5yo son saw it and wanted that color on his toes.  I want to do mine with that color next too.  She went for the purple first which is a deep, shimmery shade.  I think that with any nail art, preparation is key to getting the product to last long. I always give my girl a little &amp;#34;pedicure&amp;#34; by scrubbing her nails with a brush and gentle soap, giving the cuticles a quick push back, a little swipe of alcohol on a q-tip.  I think the base/top coat product helps a little too.  I have her hold the blow dryer (on cool) on her toes between coats and it gives her something to do.  Her pedis last about a couple weeks before looking too shabby so I think it&#x27;s worth the effort. I don&#x27;t do fingernails much because I find it chips off too fast and the littles always have their hands in their mouth. (Even though this is a more natural product, I still don&#x27;t want them ingesting it obviously.)&lt;br /&gt;Overall we are happy with this company and this set was a fun birthday gift.</li>
    <li> my toddler girls love their piggy paint!  toddler girls + nail polish would be so frightening if it didn&#x27;t dry so fast.  I won&#x27;t let them use anything else!</li>
    <li> Love this gift set! My 2.5 year old was so excited to use these colors. Very pleased with product and service.</li>
    <li> The glass bottles are fragile. My daughter dropped the bottles in the bag on carpet and one broke. Good thing it was easy to clean up. Still it was glass. Update 7/15/17 Still use the 2 bottles that survived and still having fun with them. (By using a hair drier on cold for one minute it dries flawless.. Most of the time at least!)</li>
    <li> This product went on well and stayed on well. An excellent choice for a less toxic &#x27;paint&#x27; for little ones. We also got the remover and are happy with it.  I have a feeling we&#x27;ll be buying more. My granddaughter loves it (especially on her piggies).</li>
    <li> I got this for my 2.5 year old daughter because I loved the color options.  I think they are real cute colors for a little girl.  We have used it several times how.  I actually don&#x27;t like that they nail polish doesn&#x27;t have staying power.  I painted my daughter&#x27;s nails one morning and that evening in the bath pieces of nail polish had fallen off into the bath.  That was disappointing.</li>
    <li> vivid color, kids love it</li>
    <li> Sent as birthday gift for granddaughter and was a bit hit. Did not get to see packaging, etc., but recipients happy with it, so considered it good!</li>
    <li> does not last more than one hand washing cycle.</li>
    <li> My little daughter got interested in nail polishes and I could not offer her the smelly toxic ones. Piggy paint is among the few non toxic natural options that are on the market if you want to avoid those regular brands. I bought her a set of piggy paint nail polish and based on the reviews that were saying that it does not last a long time on its own I added the make it last set [[ASIN:B00CS3T4PY Piggy Paint Gift Set, Make It Last]] to my order as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who want to know the ingredients: It contains acrylate polymers, aqua and coloring material red 34 lake , red 28 ( considered as safe by Environmental Working Group: EWG), and neem oil ( a sort of vegetable oil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think it is pretty harmless for a cosmetic product and I feel safe applying it on my daughters little finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, After all the hassle and using these pretty expensive products with base and top coats of make it last the result was great initially ( see the picture attached) however  it started getting chipped within 36 hours and three days later a few of the nails were totally blank. 6 days later it was almost impossible to say that these nails were polished at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting this nail polish to under-perform anyways but I was happy to accept it for the sake of its natural ingredients. Therefore I am giving a 4 star rating. I will keep using it until I find a non-toxic alternative that performs better. However, I would not buy the make it last kit again. I think it does not increase the paint&#x27;s longevity at all...</li>
    <li> i was so glad to finally find something non toxic to use on my grandchild&#x27;s nails. However upon opening it one of the jars was broken and had to be thrown away. i could not return it all at that point as my grandchild was with me and wanted to paint her nails immediately. i hate that i paid for 3 but only two were usable.</li>
    <li> My 4-year old granddaughter loves it</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the colors but wish it wouldn&#x27;t come off when I give her a bath.</li>
    <li> This is s terrible product. I painted my daughters nails and most of it had chipped off in less than an hour.The rest of it came off when she took a bath that evening that was about 15 minutes long. This may be child safe, but it needs to be more durable for the cost of the polish and for the effort of painting your child&#x27;s nails.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the bright colors and the polish lasts quite a while on her nails.  Especially if you purchase the base and top coat too!</li>
    <li> Not happy with product. Yes, it kid safe but it comes right off.</li>
    <li> The only nail polish my daughters let my Granddaughters use. It doesn&#x27;t have all those awful chemicals in it like all the regular nail shops use.</li>
    <li> I made a deal with my 3 year old. If she lets me clip her nails (toes included), I would paint them pretty colors. Since she was about a year old, it&#x27;s been extremely difficult to groom my daughter. The nail polish worked wonders on getting her to sit still and it&#x27;s a nice reward for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the paint chips very easily. I don&#x27;t use the top coat or blow dry with a hair dryer as suggested, so I suppose it&#x27;s not a wonder that it&#x27;s not perfect. I also assume this is the price you pay for safe ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I&#x27;d buy Piggy Paint again for my kids.</li>
    <li> This Polish is still fairly pungent and chips within about 5 minutes of drying. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Adorable and my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Bought these to do my daughters nails for a wedding. Tested them on myself first and the first time I washed my hands the tips started to chip. Not surprising but still disappointing. The purple and teal colors are great. The pink is kind of annoyingly neon pink..not a color I would wear as an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles of polish say to use with piggy paint base and top coats for best results. I didn&#x27;t know that going in but it would probably help if you need/want your polish to last a while. Definitely increases the cost of the product as well when you add in base and top coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s a novelty item. It will be cute on my daughter at the wedding, but I won&#x27;t expect it to last past her first bath after putting it on.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the colors and especially loved painting her uncle&#x27;s nails with this set. I love that there&#x27;s no odor. It dries fairly quickly. For whatever reason, it is easy to take off her fingers with nailpolish remover (regular acetone remover) but it is a huge pain to take off her toes. It may be because we often use alcohol-based hand wipes and those may act to remove it because by day 4 or so, half the polish is gone.</li>
    <li> Great polish! My little girls love the colors and I&#x27;ve even used them on my own toes and the polish works as well as the nasty chemical laden ones.</li>
    <li> We got these for our 2-year-old daughter who was fascinated with my nail polish. I had the sudden realization that regular nail polish is full of chemicals that I definitely didn&#x27;t want to be putting on my little girl, especially on her hands (that still had the tendency to find their way to her mouth quite frequently), so I began to look around for &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; nail polish. It turns out that most of the time the stuff marketed towards kids is just as bad for you as the stuff for adults. I was really happy to find these &amp;#34;natural as mud&amp;#34; polishes that are in fun colors. I love that these are safe for small kids, and have been amazed at how well they wear. I can wear them about as long as I would have with &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; polish before it begins to chip off. Extra bonus is that they don&#x27;t stink like regular polish does, too.</li>
    <li> My 3 year-old daughter loves this polish. The colors are very bright and don&#x27;t have the typical chemical smell of adult polish. The down side is that the polish chips very easily and after two days most of the polish has come off.  One of the brushes became detached from the top after the third use and we had to glue it back into the cap.</li>
    <li> We love Piggy Paint!  It lasts about 2 years before getting kind of goopy, but has no discernible odor and lasts about as well as you&#x27;d expect nail polish to on little kids.  I don&#x27;t even bother using the remover because it flakes off after a week or so and then you can just paint a new color.&lt;br /&gt;This set is great, a good true pink, a fun purple, and a funky blue, all with some shimmer to them.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because my toddler is always asking to paint her nails, and I figured this would be a safe alternative to using real nail polish. I was wrong. This stuff is not good at all. The only good thing is that the packaging and colors are really cute. But, its just too expensive for what you actually receive. It is basically just children&#x27;s waterbased paint mixed with glue. The paint is thick and somewhat dry so it didn&#x27;t apply well. It was very difficult to remove from a child&#x27;s fingernails. I had to scrub her fingers excessively and use a large amount of nail polish remover to get it off. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid by purchasing this product. It is really a poor product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this item for a long time to paint my granddaughter&#x27;s toes,  love the colors and the fact that it is non toxic. Before buying I read the comments and didn&#x27;t get the too coat because it comes off with soap and water, I don&#x27;t want it to stay on for too long so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect, safe nail polish for kids. Sweet colors.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this and I love it because it is safe for her.</li>
    <li> Safe product for toddlers.  I would suggest waiting to the age of 2 1/2 years to start using or send as a gift. Any earlier and it could be difficult to get them to sit still long enough for it to dry. It does dry VERY FAST (2-3 minutes). I put my 2 1/2 year old in her old high chair and paint them there, keeps her sitting still and in one place long enough to dry. I would not suggest the piggy paint remover however, takes a lot of scrubbing to get the paint off the nail. We use regular non-acetone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews but I have to say that for the price (about $20) I am hugely disappointed with this product. I have it 1 stars because my daughter liked the colors but if I could I would give it none. This polish comes off right after applying. I even did like the label said and used the blow dryer and I also used a base and top coat to see if maybe that would help but each time the Polish came off, and not in chips, the whole layer. If it was cheaper then maybe I could understand but it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m just going to stick with the stuff I use at least it will stay on.</li>
    <li> This set has adorable colors! I love that there are no harsh fumes and its safe for my daughter! Thank you for this fun product!</li>
    <li> Very good for kids. Natural and no strong smell like the nail polish for adult. Little more expensive, but I think it worth it.</li>
    <li> Note: I&#x27;m the father and I have zero experience with nail polish previously.    I&#x27;m not familiar with the names used in the description: pink and purple are called shimmer, and turquoise is called matte.  This is what I see.  Purple has sparkles.  Both pink and teal appear wet and glossy, but no sparkles.  My daughter likes all the colors.    Purple is very easy to apply and goes on uniformly.  The pink and teal are very difficult to apply.  Even with multiple coats, there are streaks and unevenness.  Not sure if there is any trick on applying nail polish that I&#x27;m missing.    The nail polish stays on for 24-48 hours.  After that, parts of the nail polish chip off.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to bath/showers, but from physical contact and scratches.  If we don&#x27;t remove the polish, some remnants will stay on for 2 weeks.  To remove piggy paint, I use IPA (isopropyl alcohol).  With slight pressure and some rubbing with IPA, the nail polish comes off easily.  I believe IPA should be much safer than using nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> It feels like you&#x27;re painting with shiny arylic paint. Goes on smoothly. Doesn&#x27;t last as long, but great alternative and great for kids since it dries so fast. Do not use regular base or top coat with it!!! Buy theirs is that&#x27;s something you want (I haven&#x27;t tried them) It will peel off!! Removes with alcohol.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else said, it is nice to find polish for little girls without worrying about the harmful chemicals in regular nail polish.  My daughter loves these colors, and yes, they don&#x27;t stay on long, but oh well.</li>
    <li> My 2yr old daughter loves having her own polish. Dries quick and doesn&#x27;t chip easily for being &amp;#34;natural as mud!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This was a great gift for my 3 year old niece! She absolutely loved it and wouldn&#x27;t open any other gifts before she had newly painted nails. The paint seems to dry fast enough for her busy hands and is easy to remove when desired.</li>
    <li> I love this polish. It is great for kids...it is so non toxic it wears off easily.</li>
    <li> We bought this gift set for our 3 1/2 year old wanting to avoid the toxic chemicals found in conventional nail polish. Other reviews claimed it chips or peels off rather quickly; however, that has not been our experience. We&#x27;re happy to have found a nail polish that is non-toxic and seems to stick for at least a few days.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and I feel ok letting her have her nails painted.  These colors are a super cute set too.  It goes on easy and dries fast which is key.  It doesn&#x27;t last super long but long enough and I like that it comes off easy.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 3 year old and I love that it comes off after some washings so no need for too much chemicals to remove it.</li>
    <li> Daughter (6) loves the brights colors and that she can use herself. Polish chips easily in two days or so but worth the need the re-apply in exchange for the lack of toxic smell and chemicals in other nail polish brands. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It comes off in 2 hrs. For someone that raises animals it doesn&#x27;t hold up well even with two coats and a top coat. Pretty colors though.</li>
    <li> Bright colors that are perfect for my five year old.  Having bought other non-toxic nail polishes before, the bottle were larger than I personally expected.  As children&#x27;s polish I figured they would skimp, but they are your average size bottle of paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pink is not exactly matte, but the shine could be a bit higher for my liking.  However the coverage is quite opaque, which was pleasing to see.  I squeaked by with one coat here.  It is similar to an eggshell finish.  The purple has good coverage and actually some shimmer that even my daughter noticed and appreciated.  This helped to make the finish appear a bit shinier too. (Purple was my favorite form this group)  Finally the blue is similar to the pink in the the finish (eggshell) and it really needs a second coat as it is not as opaque (i skipped this with my little one of course) but it is quite pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to get help with the shine boost, I ordered the base coat and top coat for these too, but haven&#x27;t received them yet.  I am not certain how long the polish will last but so far it seems like regular nail polish.  There is a strong order if you put your nose close to the bottle, but you actually have to get quite neat to smell it.  This is definitely non-toxic and overall, even has less odor than other non-toxic polishes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drying time of one coat was about 1-2 minutes on my daughter - yea. On the cheap I suppose I could just use non-toxic crafters latex paint, (just put in empty bottles) but this was a fun treat for my little one.</li>
    <li> I got these mainly to make fake make up for my daughter. You take old makeup containers and put nail polish in them to dry to look like makeup they can play with. I used regular nail polish first time and they always smelled. These dried fast and did not have a nasty nail polish smell so she can enjoy playing and acting like she is putting on makeup. For nails they are nice. Colors are always pretty and dry fast. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is they come off/wear off very fast and easily which upsets my daughter, and I am also forced to paint nails often.</li>
    <li> Product arrived busted within the package that from the outside seemed intact. Very disappointed considering the ridiculosly high cost for nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;My twin nieces were sad! :(</li>
    <li> Baby safe &amp; adorable!</li>
    <li> While this nail polish LOOKS ADORABLE. ..it is an accident waiting to happen! My daughter picked up a bottle to hand to me and dropped it. Needless to say it SHATTERED sending glass and nail polish flying. This product is made for children...perhaps they should use plastic bottles!</li>
