<li> it really made life miserable for me for a good 5-6 days.</li>
<li> A bit too pricey for me in the long haul.</li>
<li> I feel kind of stupid looking back on things b/c, after all, it is pine POLLEN.  </li>
<li> Normal for my age should be at least 600.  </li>
<li> but I have not really.  </li>
<li> I would be curious to know what my T count is now.  </li>
<li> On par with the other pollen I&#x27;ve had.</li>
<li> It does have a pine-sap sort of smell and taste, but it is faint unless you take it straight (which I would not recommend!).  </li>
<li> but i just take a half a spoon a day</li>
<li> There is no more to say about it besides it didn&#x27;t have any effect.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this in my life.</li>
<li> I used this product for approximately 3 days before my mouth broke out into dozens of ulcers.  </li>
<li> it hurt so bad, and after I screened negative for Strep, the doctor looked into my mouth and immediately told me it looked like an allergic reaction to something.  </li>
<li> This stuff is expensive too.  </li>
<li> it is  vcery expensive considering the quantity you get...</li>
<li> so that was jsut disappointing</li>
<li> and it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
<li> A book (which isn&#x27;t all bad but which I won&#x27;t name as not to promote it) made the claim that pine pollen is powdered testosterone.</li>
<li> and he suggested that since I have bad seasonal allergies, that I was probably allergic to this also.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The pine pollen seems very pure and well prepared. It seems to mix better with fruit juices than with clear liquids.</li>
    <li> Surthrival products are thoroughly researched and use only the highest quality ingredients and extraction methods.  Daniel Vitalis knows his stuff!  Surthrival&#x27;s Pine Pollen Powder is no exception.  This powder boasts an impressive array of nutrients and a little goes a long way.  This canister will likely last you a month if you use about a teaspoon a day.  You can mix it into almost any smoothie or sprinkle it on your food.  It does have a pine-sap sort of smell and taste, but it is faint unless you take it straight (which I would not recommend!).  I prefer the liquid form since it more easily blends with my elixirs, but this is great stuff and super nutrition for your body.</li>
    <li> Great for increasing testosterone</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any effects from taking this stuff, which isn&#x27;t very comforting for the price of just under $30.</li>
    <li> mmm...ordered it,got it, its been sitting there...i might at well start using it...ok .as for the review ..wat i fekt about it soo far is that.....it is  vcery expensive considering the quantity you get...so that was jsut disappointing is y this is still stiing in the closet..cuz i dint wanna end up using it in 4 days ..n burp...so ya but for results lets see...ima review it fot that later...like i didnt think the quantity you get with this can lead you to conclusive results about this product is the point i tried to make!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as scheduled, so far so good, need more time to write about its potential... Packaging was fine, service was good.</li>
    <li> Every now and then I let myself get talked into snake oil and quackery. This was one of those times. A book (which isn&#x27;t all bad but which I won&#x27;t name as not to promote it) made the claim that pine pollen is powdered testosterone.Yeah, no, I know. I have yet to find a credible study that shows that pine pollen has any other health benefit.</li>
    <li> good product.....goes great with smoothies</li>
    <li> My verdict is not in completely. Been using it for about a month now.  I have noticed that after consuming it, I feel great energy and clarity.  I also think it really has helped me with my workouts at the gym. Especially if I take it about 30 mins before.  I was hoping to get a better libido on this but I have not really.  The first week, i felt a rise,no pun intended but after that, nil.  I would be curious to know what my T count is now.  I came back at like 400 last time I went to dr last year.  Normal for my age should be at least 600.  This stuff is expensive too.  I am on my second tub and they should give you a measuring spoon with so you know exactly how much you are taking.  I would say this product is average at best</li>
    <li> I used this product for approximately 3 days before my mouth broke out into dozens of ulcers.  I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this in my life. I actually went to my doctors to get tested for Strep throat it hurt so bad, and after I screened negative for Strep, the doctor looked into my mouth and immediately told me it looked like an allergic reaction to something.  I told him about this pine pollen powder I was taking and he suggested that since I have bad seasonal allergies, that I was probably allergic to this also.  I feel kind of stupid looking back on things b/c, after all, it is pine POLLEN.  Nothing bothers me more than pollen in the spring, so this makes sense.  Lesson learned.  This might be a great product for those who don&#x27;t suffer from seasonal allergies.  And I suppose my reaction could be a huge coincidence and it wasn&#x27;t the pine pollen at all, but I thought I&#x27;d post this just in case b/c it really made life miserable for me for a good 5-6 days.</li>
    <li> boosts your vitality and energy noticeably</li>
    <li> This stuff is remarkable.  Start off with small amounts as this stuff is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Going to order more.  So far so good.  Probably best to order in bulk. Also, if you check out their site, they have additional products...</li>
    <li> I saw no benefits at all fromn this product. There is no more to say about it besides it didn&#x27;t have any effect.</li>
    <li> A bit too pricey for me in the long haul. I am OK with the Chinese products,&lt;br /&gt;they are very good too.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff. On par with the other pollen I&#x27;ve had. I mixed it with juice and it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> This pine pollen is the best I have used, it&#x27;s a great addition to my fresh vegie juices in the morning.</li>
    <li> Ok I was very skeptical about this product but after reading many reviews, watching YouTube videos and finally deciding to take a chance and make the purchase, I am glad I did!  If you are new to Pine Pollen I suggest you start with the best (Surthrival brand) and then experiment with the other cheaper brands.  This is like it says, High Quality wild harvested!  A teaspoon in the morning will give you &amp;#34;NOTICEABLE&amp;#34;  Energy within minutes!  I work in healthcare and it is very busy but one tsp of this and your are like a working machine!  Clean energy with so many amino Acids and other needed ingredients.  I purchased one 48 gram jar of this and now am a reseller of it.  I don&#x27;t sell anything I don&#x27;t try and know that it works as described.  I say try it and then come back here and write your own review.  Seeing/trying is believing.  The people at Surthrival are great people and want to share their experience with you as I do.  They have my full support and confidence as they will with yours once you try it.  I guarantee it!</li>
    <li> Very clean and dry. you can put it in drinks or food but i just take a half a spoon a day</li>
