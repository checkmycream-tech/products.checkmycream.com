      <li>I have been battling rosacea for many years.  </li>

      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s very greasy, didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>

      <li>Works really well to reduce skin redness.</li>
      <li>Too soon to really see results.</li>
      <li>I have had mild to moderate Rosacea for close to 5 years now.</li>
      <li>However, it made my skin soft and supple, did not irritate me, and had decent reviews, so I kept with it.</li>

<li> Since moving to the southern border my skin had a hard time adjusting.  </li>

<li> My Esthetician says this product strengthens your skin, so that your rosacea is less noticeable when you are in situations that trigger rosacea.</li>
<li> I use organic raw coconut oil</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, twice daily after cleansing, and the change is very dramatic.</li>
<li> I recommend this product to anyone who suffers from the facial burning of rosacea</li>
<li> The redness in my face has decreased probably by 70%</li>
<li> I have never used a product that has decreased my redness, I am still hoping this is the one.</li>
<li> It seemed to make my redenss even worse.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive, I paid $56 for a 1.67 ounce bottle.</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
<li> My rosacea isn&#x27;t terribly bad but this keeps the redness to a minimum to non-existent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Agree you have to keep using it, takes a couple of weeks to work. It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin and provides just enough moisture for my combination skin. My skin is so sensitive to breakouts too and this does not irritate it.</li>
    <li> Quality is as good as others have reported.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like it at all. It seemed to make my redenss even worse. Plus it&#x27;s very greasy, didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> I wondered myself if this product really worked. After two bottles, I ran out of it, got busy, forgot about it. And the redness in my cheeks became more noticeable as the weeks went by. My Esthetician says this product strengthens your skin, so that your rosacea is less noticeable when you are in situations that trigger rosacea. I believe it! I&#x27;m buying more. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> Love all their products and this is one of the best. Works really well to reduce skin redness. Priced well on Amazon</li>
    <li> I mix this with a little of the B5 gel and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and &amp;#34;calms down&amp;#34; any redness from the rosacea or acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now and while I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing any harm, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reducing any redness either.  The three stars is because I do think it&#x27;s a nice light moisturizer for under my heavier one.</li>
    <li> Since moving to the southern border my skin had a hard time adjusting.  The doctor recommended this cream after my laser treatment and I could not be happier.  Amazon carries it much cheaper than the other websites.</li>
    <li> My rosacea isn&#x27;t terribly bad but this keeps the redness to a minimum to non-existent.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this order.</li>
    <li> this is a good product, as most of skinceuticals is... i did not realize it is for spot treatment.  it says it will lighten skin, i was wanting this more evening tone on my whole face, not for spot treatment.</li>
    <li> This really does help my face!</li>
    <li> I got this product because I saw it advertised on a local dermatologists website. It&#x27;s expensive, I paid $56 for a 1.67 ounce bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and have seen no visible results better or worse. I will continue to use the product until it&#x27;s gone and I&#x27;ll update monthly. I apply it every morning and evening to my skin first before I put on sunscreen (morning) or my metrogel (evening) because I want to make sure it&#x27;s getting in my pores. I have had mild to moderate Rosacea for close to 5 years now. I have never used a product that has decreased my redness, I am still hoping this is the one.</li>
    <li> it seems to help the redness.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy, and most of all it works.  Plenty of product in the bottle.</li>
    <li> For the treatment of rosacea is an excellent product. I&#x27;m seeing the resultsand keep informing them about this product. Love it</li>
    <li> Helps with the redness, best thing I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> The product has a very nice texture, but did nothing for the redness of my skin.</li>
    <li> Does not last all day and drys out face.  It is neccessary to use a lot of moisture lotion with product</li>
    <li> So far, I love how it feels on my skin.  My Esthetician explained that a product will not do a lot for the redness for about twelve weeks and not to give up on that part of the product.  It takes time for our skin layers to slough off and change.  I have only been using it for a week and will continue the use to see if it will improve the redness but for now cannot give it a low rating just because it did not work like a prescription product such as Mirvaso.</li>
    <li> When I first used this product it decreased redness a little, not enough for me to spend this much money again. I wasn&#x27;t blown away. However, it made my skin soft and supple, did not irritate me, and had decent reviews, so I kept with it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, twice daily after cleansing, and the change is very dramatic. The redness in my face has decreased probably by 70% and I&#x27;m not as prone to getting flushed and red when I am talking to people or going out. Everyone who sees me without makeup has noticed a difference. This product won&#x27;t work overnight! It&#x27;s not a cortisone cream, you have to use it 2x a day for several weeks before you can see results. In the past I had to wear completely opaque green makeup under my foundation to get a good canvas, but now I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product, but I have noticed that it helps to cool my skin, which I love.  I recommend this product to anyone who suffers from the facial burning of rosacea</li>
    <li> Too soon to really see results. I will keep using the product until it is gone to see how well it works,</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help tone down the redness on my face, particularty around the nose and cheeks.  I used up one bottle, didn&#x27;t see anything happening.  So thought, lets buy one more, because they say the longer you use a product, the better the results.  Well still no results.  Even my dermatologist recommend this product.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
    <li> Excellent .  My skin is totally white.  All the redness disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for my mild rosacea (chin and sides of face) and this product in conjunction with this SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic is the best combination I have used yet. I would strongly recommend. If you have  really dry skin (like me)  you will need additional moisturizer. I use organic raw coconut oil</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a skinceuticals box that looks like it&#x27;s been sitting in a store window for ages. It&#x27;s ripped, and stained. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> It is every thing I asked for and more.  Shipping was earlier than stated, I works great to get rid of the red.</li>
    <li> I have been battling rosacea for many years.  I began using Skinceuticals products along with the redness reliever a few months ago and it has made a very significant improvement in my skin texture, tone, and color!  I usually flare up during the summer months, and I not only never saw a flare up, but I have seen so much improvement that I now can go out without makeup/foundation on my face!  I will continue to use these products.  Skinceuticals is the best I&#x27;ve tried!  I use the Phyto corrective gel, Vit B serum, CE Ferulic and Redness Neutralizer every morning, and the overnight moisturizer for dry skin at night.</li>
    <li> I got this product due to recent redness and blotchiness on my cheeks.  I have been using this for about a week and the redness is going away.  My skin looks better already!</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see if this will help my flares while outdoors. Now that spring is here, I will know soon! So far, so good.</li>
