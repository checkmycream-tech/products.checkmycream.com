<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> with time this works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised this product really works I started using this product in April and it has really improved the blemishes and Sun spots on my face, I also have been using it on my elbows and private area which were darker for years, it is a slow process but I notice a huge difference my only disappointment is that it can get pricey for a 1oz tube it only last one to two weeks maybe because I use it everyday twice a day on multiple areas... overall I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use</li>
    <li> My girl friend told me that it doesn&#x27;t work for her skin.</li>
    <li> A total waste of money. It did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> This really works. Have been dealing with dark underpits for years. Finally something that works. Noticed the difference within a few days</li>
    <li> It worked, improvement was noted, but only so much. do not expect a change in complexion. It just lighten some dark areas, such as armpits.&lt;br /&gt;Do not apply it over products such as deodorants. Use over clean, dried and healthy skin. Do not apply right after hair removal of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;Best to use at nights. Do not expose your skin treated with the product to the sun right away, even after washing it, wait a couple of days, remember it is absorbed.</li>
    <li> This product works really fast.  I saw great results almost immediately!  I even ordered a few tubes for my mother and she loves it too. Her skin is clear and the sun burn is almost gone!</li>
    <li> Garbage, doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I used this product for my underarm pits and omg .. its embarrassing working out at the gym when i have to lift my arm! I started using this product in march and by may I seen a big difference, no more dark armpits especially due to the fact that i shave. i also used this product for my bikini line it helped a little bit but this mostly worked out for my arm pits. this product works good enough for me i&#x27;d give it 5 starts but 4 is good for now only because it takes a while to see actual results.</li>
    <li> this product is crap, this product doesn&#x27;t deliver any of the claims it states. what a waste of money!!!!! dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Great Skin Lightening Product for very reasonable price! Thanks! What else can I say...easy &amp; pleasant to use! Thank u!</li>
    <li> the product made my skin DARKER. the light tan armpit is BLACK now&lt;br /&gt;Do.not buy or use this product. The reviews on YouTube are fake&lt;br /&gt;i want to kill myself</li>
    <li> It really works! Use it every day twice a day and you&#x27;ll start seeing results in a week :) its great and smells good too.</li>
    <li> Ive had this cream for less than 2 weeks and seen a little lightening so far which i didnt expect so soon. I will continue to use and hopefully it doesnt get dark again like some of the other reviews stated after stopping use. I apply this not to my under arms but to my elbows and knees, so i.ll write another update review in I give it 3 more weeks...</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for about a month to lighten my dark armpits. i really started seeing impressive results during the first week into two weeks. however, but the third week, some areas on my armpit became increasingly painful and by the 4th week, there were painful bruises /scab which maid it difficult to even raise my arms. i have stopped use of this product until the scabs are heeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all other reviews seem positive so my experience may not be someone else&#x27;s so i would recommend it to any one who wants to try</li>
    <li> Just using it for almost a week and I can see the difference...my armpit is getting whiter.  I can raise my glass higher! I would like to thank my cousin who recommended this product.</li>
    <li> Really worked !!! For all skin even the back door!</li>
    <li> Has worked really great in a short amount of time to lighten my underarms and bikini line. I am a dark skinned female. I&#x27;ve used piona prior to this, and this product helped quickly improve the work that piona had already done over the past few months. I&#x27;ve been using this about a month</li>
    <li> Okey the product works!! it really brightens the skin to a degree that it sort of becomes brighter than your actual skin color. Be careful when using it, apply only to the spot or mark that you need to brighten.</li>
    <li> I am on my first tube and been using it for about three and a half weeks, I can already see results under my armpits but everything takes time of course so I am going to continue using the gel and see if it completely bleaches my skin to its normal color. So far so good though. I would recommend this gel to someone with my issue (dark under armpits).</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned, I am a woman of color, and what tends to happen when a woman of color shaves regularly or even waxes, or uses hair removal creams as well as using commercial brand deodorants is that irritaion may result, or certain chemicals may result to skin discoloration. Dark irritated underarms is not appealing or not the business! After years of trying products that claim they worked, but produce minimal results at best (be careful alot of products may be great at first but as it becomes more \\&quot;POPULAR\\&quot; what you may start seeing happen is that the Manufacturer may start weakening the products strength to make you use more as a result you will buy more. So in any case I saw the same You Tube video many commentors on here speak of, &amp; I probably went through like 6 tubes in the past 6 months, with maximum results accomplished after 2 tubes (as someone else has said it turned my entire underarm area lighter than what my skin complexion actually is. Im talking pale pink. And my natural complexion is Caramel Brown. So YES it took away the DARKNESS...and the pigment to my regular skin as well. So when you notice this happening &amp; when you get your desired level of lightness accomplished id advise anyone to STOP using the product, use sunscreen and a non commercial Deodorant that has NO type of \\&quot;Alluminum\\&quot; ingredient in it. &amp; the Darkness should not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of lately However, my money has been tight, I havent been to the official website in a long while to purchase a couple more tubes. Using it twice a day can use up the product very fast (thats why I always purchase 2 tubes at a time). Id hope with the sales as high as they have been on this product with all the \\&quot;You Tube video\\&quot; footage Boosting this items sales through the roof (im sure). Last I checked they only had the cream (NOT GEL) in a large tube. Id hope by now they have this GEL in a larger size because this small tube uses it very quickly. &amp; @ $12 Dollars a pop, that easily adds upover time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I am able to afford to get back on the Xtreme Brite train....I have been using a natural approach to maintaining my underarms even complexion (courtesy  of Xtreme Brite) &amp; that is simply by rubbing LEMON under my arms twice a day (or once). LOL, Hey dont knock it til you try it (it works &amp; keeps money in your pocket)! Its been doing great long as I been on my Xtreme Brite vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. WOULD I RECOMMEND to a friend?- YES, those who experience underarm darkness (especially if their underarms become dark easily with irritation, or certain deodorants) like mines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. WOULD I USE ON MY FACE? - NO WAY! I love my God Given \\&quot;Caramel Brown\\&quot; complexion. I saw how strong this stuff actually is, turning my entire underarms area light pink (do I prefer light pink underams over really dark brown armpits? YES. Once I stopped using the product, my real color came back/evened out again.) but I wouldnt want a Light pink face. personally I feel the product is too strong for the face &amp; even for spot treatments. Who wants to be \\&quot;light pink\\&quot;? NOT MEEEE (strictly for my underarms for me.) &amp; if you do use it on your face dont forget your neck and ears....dont want a pink face with brown ears and brown neck etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. WHEN YOU START USING THIS XTREME BRITE PRODUCT- STOP- USING- HARSH COMMERCIAL Ad Deodorants with all the harsh ingredients in them like \\&quot;alluminum\\&quot;....or anything thats sounds like \\&quot;alluminum\\&quot;-they smell great, but they will \\&quot;Blacken your armpits with the metals &amp; other harsh chemicals in them TRUST ME, I experienced it for YEARS. The lemons work great at eliminating underarm odor for a whole entire day on its own. But I use TOMS deodorant (natural), or a  mild fragrance oil with a little baking soda &amp; that works also. (NOTE: see UPDATE below on a natural deodorant I recommend and am currently using)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. HAIR REMOVAL METHODS may cause the SKIN DAMAGE- Havent shaved my armnpits since HIGH SCHOOL, Im 36 years oldnow. Shaving irritated my skin very badly no matter what. It would lead to break outs and itching, &amp; of course Darkness under my arms will follow. HAIR REMOVAL CREAM caused irritation as well and smells bad too, result&#x3D; irritation &amp; dark underarms as well. WAXING for me? not good, damaged my underarms First try top layer of skin ripped off&#x3D; irritation &amp; more darkness as it healed. I have been EPILATING for years now (about as painful as WAXING) especially when you first start doing it, but over time your skin will become use to it. Its proved to be the best method so far....but the EPILATOR can cause bumps also (ingrown hairs) sometimes irritates but nothing like the creams &amp; shaving. Whatever work best for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO YES! if you are a individual of color experiencing under arm DARKNESS, use this item as directed &amp; dont give up until your desired results are achieved! Make this product your go to product when you experience discoloration of your underarms even if its just little spots. The reason Black People or people who are BROWN experience skin discoloration, is because we have more Melanin in our skin. It keeps you more YOUTHFUL compared to FAIR/LIGHTER SKINNED individuals, but Darker skin is also more prone to experiencing skin discoloration after any type of skin damage (including-acne, scars, irritation...) GOOD LUCK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3/4/12&lt;br /&gt;Im going to the main website EXTREMEBRITE.COM (where I use to always buy the product) &amp; Im going start recommending they make the gel in a larger tube, this way folks will be comfortable with just- (2) 2oz tubes rather than (4) 1oz tubes for example (the price would be doubled of course, but shipping 2 larger tubes would be alot more easier than packaging 4 1oz tubes. They have another GEL product in 2oz tube (lasted me forever) but didnt produce results like the XTREME BRITE GEL. I still used it because by that time my arms were already lightened thanks to the XTREME BRITE GEL. But I suggest other usersgo to their main website &amp; email the manufacturers to start making the XTREME BRITE GEL in a larger tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12/1/12&lt;br /&gt;RECENTLY (this past month) I did a search on EBAY for \\&quot;NATURAL DEODORANTS\\&quot; or \\&quot;ALUMINUM FREE DEODORANTS\\&quot; the search results was great! But I found a wonderful seller who sells a product called \\&quot;MIGHTY DEODORANT\\&quot;. Its 100% all natural ingredients and works GREAT on under arm odor ALL DAY! Its very affordable &amp; you can pick the scent you want. I recommend all interested in a natural deodorant that actually works for odors go to Ebay &amp; look up the product.</li>
    <li> Usually these brightening, lightening, skin tone evening, dark spot removing, etc. type creme take up to 8 days to 2 weeks to show visible results, but starts showing huge results in as little as 2 days.  The product dries and becomes and clear and unnoticeable (it&#x27;s invisible and light)film. It&#x27;s a barrier that protects your skin. The gel formula is not greasy. It&#x27;s safe and effective at removing dark spots and treating patchy skin tone. The only kink is the price. It&#x27;s easy to through a tube in 2-3 weeks (that&#x27;s only if you&#x27;re careful and you only use it once a day) so you have to keep buying more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for roughly a week, and I cannot get enough! I have medium-fair skin, and have had this ugly red scar across the bridge of my nose for a few years.  I originally bought this product for my dark underarms, but it reduces scar-redness at an incredible rate (and price!). I completely recommend this product, however, keep in mind to apply it to the problem area carefully - it will bleach your skin!</li>
    <li> I got this very quickly.. I use it along with an epilator.. Which i have noticed an extreme diffrence in my armpits.. the were very dark but not anymore.. I still need a bit improvement but not that much.. Im very grateful for this product..</li>
    <li> I am an african american female 18.My underarms were BLACK okay...BLACK..I dont know how. I&#x27;m very clean. Prolly cuase of shavin. but anywayz it made me VERY insecure. I was Not able to wear tanks or sleeveless shirts. cause it was so embarrasing!!! I saw a woman on youtube reviewing this for her underarms. So i tried it for myself applying it day and night FAITHFULLY.I really didnt need a deoderant because this actually acted as a deorderant. Two months later, i kid you not my stains are literally LIGHT! I go around the house waving my hands in the air because I finally just feel confident. I didnt use the complete set just the xtreme brite gel. I&#x27;m not some fake either.. This stuff really works! Look at all the great reviews.My mama called the company and they told her once you get the color you want, just use it once a week to maintain it.SO don&#x27;t wait a day later moapin around the house when you can do something about it! I hope God answers your prays as he has mine. :)</li>
    <li> This item does what it says it will; which is to brighten skin. I am going to purchase more since it worked so well on me.</li>
    <li> Hi all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first review here in amazon. I am very glad that my first review is on this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is too too good.I loved it.I used many many things to get rid of my dark underarms.But finally the only thing which worked is this , the xtreme brite gel. I watched the video in youtube on this gel and have immediately ordered here.&lt;br /&gt;I got this in december and was using since then. Still i am using it and could see that 70% of the darkness is gone, jus vanished.. OMG !! its AWESOME&lt;br /&gt;I have applied twice in a day. day and night and saw a gradual change. Have not used anywhere else on the body.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered the soap as well and its quite well.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend everybody who is suffering from dark underarms to use this and but please do NOT use or apply it on the area where there is no darkness, it will bleach and the skin may peel off. So be careful while applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise its the awesome product and will keep using this :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product, from 3 weeks now. The results are not that great. I have seen a lil bit of a difference, but my underarms still look very dark. I think, to get the color of my actual skin, i need to spend money for 4 more tubes..</li>
    <li> I have darkish armpits and this product helped lighten them I still want them lighter but overall this stuff works I loved it I used the whole tube.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I bought this to get rid of my Underarm darkness. My skintone can be best described as MAC NC35. I started using this on my underarms regularly for a week, twice a day. After a week of little to no results I got disgruntled and pretty much stopped using it. By this time I was cursing myself for buying the 3 pack instead of just trying out one first. I&#x27;ve had hormonal acne in the last few months which have left noticeable red marks on my face. On a whim, I dotted this gel on the scars before I went to sleep. I woke up in the morning and the scars were barely noticeable! I mean really. I was staying home today so I did the same thing today morning. Went to the mirror in the evening and saw that my scars have almost disappeared! I&#x27;m so excited now. Based on what I saw while applying it on my face, I think it&#x27;ll work on underarms too if I put it on thicker and on the surface, instead of rubbing it into the skin. Just my opinion though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 yrs old and have been struggling with really dark underarms for like&lt;br /&gt;5 yrs after the birth of my daughter they got really bad and it didint go away I tried all kinds of creams,home remedies waxing u name it I tried it...I never wear sleeveless tops ,dresses cause its embarrassing and I was afraid people would think i just didint wash them or something  I hated it cause in the summer I have to wear long sleeve shirts or cardigans on top of shirts to not show my underarms ..but I came across a video on YouTube and decided to try it I got it within 2days of ordering it Ive been using it for a week know once in the morning and once at night and they are almost even with the rest of my skin tone I&#x27;m surprised it works so fast  it&#x27;s gentle on ur skin ,smooth,smells good and no nasty residue I love it can&#x27;t wait for summer this yr..I absolutely recommend this product to anyone with the same problem I will defenetly  be ordering again  thanks to the people who made this I love it  ;)</li>
    <li> love this product! with a little patience, you can really tell the difference... will continue to use it! Highly recommend it to those who have pigmentation problems or even just use for regular deodorant.</li>
    <li> At first i got really excited about this product coz i saw a lot of good reviews on it and saw videos on youtube. So i purchased it right away (3 pcs in 1 pack). The shipping was fast coz i live in canada. I got dark armpits after giving birth to my daughter few years ago. At first it was ok my armpits got a little bit lighter, just a little after a month using it. Awhile ago when i took a shower and raised my armpits i was horrified! My armpits were way more darker than before! Im so furious right now. Im just on my second tube and im not done using it. I saw red lines and dark spots on my armpits. I cant believe this. I thought this product will solve my problems. Now im so depressed. I think i need to see a dermatologist to solve this problem. Btw, im light skinned asian, i saw previous reviews and i think this product doesnt work for asians like me. Im happy for those people who achieved lighter armpits. But for me it didnt work and it made it worst. Im not happy at all.</li>
    <li> I ended up with chemical burns on my face and it didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> I saw several reviews on YouTube regarding the effect of this product to lighten dark areas on the skin and was pleasantly surprised that it worked. I applied the gel for about 1 week and saw a great improvement on my skin&#x27;s appearance. I will repurchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I can see nothing after used this product for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I can see nothing after used this product for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a little skeptical when reading the reviews because it seemed like it worked mostly for women of a darker complexion. I&#x27;m bi-racial and I have a complexion similar to that of a fair Hispanic woman. I purchased this product two weeks ago and I am shocked EVERY TIME I USE IT because it gets noticeably lighter with each passing day and it&#x27;s only been two weeks!!! The results are simply astounding and it works just fine for my skin type. It&#x27;s a small bottle so I had to order more after two weeks but it&#x27;s worth it!!!!!</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love this stuff. I recently was on youtube looking for cures for dark underarms on dark skinned black people because i am black of course. But this one girl posted this video and mentioned this gel so i was like whoa imma try this stuff. so i am in afghanistan and i got the product really quick and i have not shaved my underarms in years i always wax so i dont get razor bumps. so anyways within days of using the product my underarms were turning white...i was so excited and still am. also on of the youtube videos this lady was saying to stop using deoderant with some type of chemical so i also stopped using that type of deoderant and was using this crystal mineral deoderant and didnt really like it too much, so as of now ever since i been using the xtreme gel i dont even wear deoderant at all and i dont have any body odor what so ever and this happend like a week of only using the gel and i never stink at all. thats how it worked for me and im so pleased. Now i am using it on my face and my friend just complminted me on my skin on how bright it looks and i am in the sun 24/7 and it still works but i know it would be better if i wasnt outside so much. anyways i just ordered 12 more bottles and also i orderd the firming cream they make as well so hopefully it is good as the gel. hope this helps out and i promise you wont regret it....buy it now lol</li>
    <li> delivered experience ok.. The item was to strong for my skin, &amp; I  have very sensitive skin, &amp; I broke out with pimples,&amp; my chin burned a little after I used the product.. Because I only used the product for maybe 6 days, I&#x27;m not able to tell if it works.(as far as brighten the skin) But I can say it has no moisture so it makes the skin very dry,The tube is to small,(1oz) and it cost$$(15.25) a lot for very little product. Because of the issues I experience I have to give 2 stars... I really don&#x27;t like to speak negative, but I just wanted to be real about my experience.. Now just because it happen to me doesn&#x27;t mean it will happen to you.. Everybody is different..... Other then that customer service was ok, just not the product for me......</li>
    <li> Finally got something that works! I&#x27;m about to order my second one.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item to lighten up my face because my body was much much lighter than my face, and it WORKED GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> ive been using this product for 2 weeks now...it works a little...i love the smell,it smell so fresh and clean,its not sticky ..and im almost out of it...im gonna buy some more..</li>
    <li> People don&#x27;t waste your time with this product doesn&#x27;t work in the slightest I wish I had listened to the other review warning me about this scam run from this product.</li>
    <li> I started taking it for about a week then skin got darker but I read on reviews it does that then peels so about a month later I continued the product again and started peeling only two days after haven&#x27;t noticed any changes sense the first peel but I will keep trying.   So I started using it again daily and I am seeing a difference. I just bought another tube and I am excited to keep seeing results</li>
    <li> I feel like it dont really work like everybody said it was going to work but lol they did say use it  two time aday which I did not do so that could be the problem even thought it take time to work it do, do  something  :/</li>
    <li> i so glad i got this product. it works so good. i use it underneth my underarms i might need another tube but its so worth it now i can raise up my arms with out all the huge dark spot.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to lighten my underarms that were terribly dark. Bottom line it worked Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!! i started buying this product in Nov 2011 and I have purchased several tubes since. I use it twice a day. Here&#x27;s the best part....I believe I developed dark under arms after reaching and finding out that certain products in deoderants can cause dark underarms. I used deoderant every single day to avoid stinky underarms....however now I just put this on every morning after my shower and it keeps me completely dry. There&#x27;s absolutely no need for me to use any deoderant and I&#x27;m always fresh and never moist or stinky. Therefore the product works all around. Buy it and try it....it works!</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my skin discoloration.</li>
    <li> I am the kind of buyer that seller may hate. I leave bad comments if the product is really bad and don&#x27;t say anything if the product is good. But this product is amazing! i&#x27;ve been using this for my underarm for almost 3 weeks now and I have never seen my underarm this clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 29 now and I can say that I have used tons and tons of products to whiten my underarm. From papaya soap to a $50 worth of cream that don&#x27;t work. I use this product as my underam cream and I dont use any deodorant coz based on other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t work well with anything with alum. I observed that I don&#x27;t have that much underarm perspiration. I don&#x27;t get any bad odor since I squeeze 1 lime into cup of warm water and splash onto my body (of course on my underarm). I also think, since I wax my underarm every week, it also helps removing the darkness. I am only halfway of my tube so I am contemplating of using it into other parts of my body. I know it&#x27;ll work as much as it does on my underarm.</li>
    <li> I used this faithfully for two months.  No results at all.  I have deep toned skin so maybe just too much melanin.  I won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago after seeing this video on you tube by some african american girl. I have only been using it for about a week. I use it twice a day as recommended once during the day and once at night. So far I do see some results my skin looks a bit clearer and lighter and a plus that I may add is, I no longer wear deodorant as this gel serves as one very clean. A lot of the reviews say it takes time so I will continue to use it until I get maximum results. After a month I&#x27;m sure I will see a major difference. So excited!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to wait a couple of more weeks before I revised my review, well let me tell you its been about almost 1 month and 2 weeks since i have been using this product and the results are amazing(used it on underarms). At first I was very skeptical just like most of us are, but I thought hey what do I have to loose if it doesn&#x27;t work...right? well the little darn gel did its job, my underarms are so nice and white now they no longer have the patchy gray shadow they had from so many harsh deodorants and shaving. Even my family noticed and said wow what a difference!!!!! If you are a female going through this problem I highly recommend it!!!!!! It takes time but it works! don&#x27;t get discourage seriously....after just one week I almost gave up but, I am so glad I didn&#x27;t it takes time and patience and using the product right.</li>
    <li> Ordered this and got it in about 2-3 days! Very satisfied w that. I purchased because I am a whit complected Hispanic woman and I have dark underarms. I thought this would work cuz I read great reviews but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I bought 2 tubes &amp; nothing! It actually burns when I apply it. It might work for others but not for me. Will not b purchasing again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: okay okay so I have to update! I recently started using this product again because I still had some left and I saw more and more great reviews. So this 2nd time around it seems like it is working! I think what I did wrong was that I was over applying it &amp; that caused my underarms to burn and get red. I now only use a pea sized amount and distribute it evenly on my underarm every morning and night. At night I lay down with my arms up so it can dry. During the day when I apply it, once it dries I use Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials deodorant over the gel. It&#x27;s aluminum free. I live in Texas and its gets really hot so I don&#x27;t wanna risk not wearing any then smelling! So I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half to 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve seen a little change. There&#x27;s a patch on each underarm that got really lighter than the rest of my underarm lol I am happy that it looks like it is working this time. I&#x27;m going to keep on using it and hopefully my whole underarm will be lighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 24 year old Hispanic woman and I have been dealing with this problem for as long as I can remember! Probably since like 4th or 5th grade maybe younger I don&#x27;t know! I don&#x27;t know what has caused this! I shave my underarms and used to use deodorants with aluminum but all of my friends do too and they don&#x27;t have this problem! It sucks because I can&#x27;t wear cute strapless shirts anywhere or nice strapless dresses to the club! I wish I could cuz I live in Texas and its uber hot! But I will update again if I see more improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd update: ok so after using 2 tubes &amp; applying twice a day it worked!! My underarms were really light then after like 3 weeks they started getting dark again. Like if my skin just got used to the product or idk. But now my underarms are dark again and around my underarms where it wasn&#x27;t even dark got dark too so I&#x27;m kinda disappointed. Idk what else to try. I continued using the 3rd tube but I see no difference so I might just stop before it gets darker and worse.</li>
    <li> I am a very fair skinned Asian, so having dark pits can be really noticeable!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products to remove stains from my underarm due to years of using deodorant (approximately 30 years!) and likely shaving and waxing caused it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last 5+ years I&#x27;ve been using different whitening creams and soaps. But it would only lighten very slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With xtreme brite gel, I used it 2 times daily. Making sure the area is dry before applying the gel. Also DO NOT use whitening soap (like likas papaya soap) because it will be too strong for the skin and will be irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, 2 months and half a gel tube later, I can wear sleeveless! Even my husband says my pits are so white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the  Xtreme Brite Gel!</li>
    <li> I hardly ever review products but I felt compelled to comment on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works way better than advertised. I am a chocolate complexioned lady who had the issue with dark underarms. I even went to a dermatologist about this issue (Feb 27, 2012).The dermatologist gave me some Urea stuff and said that it will take months to work. I started using this product on February 28th and within weeks (maybe two), I noticed that it was working. I now willingly show my friends my underarms - this stuff is amazing. My underarms are now as light as the rest of my body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I applied twice a day, but now I use it once a day. I do use deodorant after letting the gel dry because I feel like this stuff does not provide adequate coverage (especially when it is hot outside). After using it for about a month, I noticed that it dried the skin on my arms (not the underarm - but the surrounding arm) - Moisturizing cream solved that within a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation for anyone doubting that this cream works is to just try it. Buy 1 tube at first. I initially bought a pack of 3 and am now on my second pack of 3. I will continue to use it even after I get to where I want to be. I would say that I am 70% there after two months - and can at this point comfortably camisole tops to exercise classes without feeling self concious.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product...Saw results in 3 weeks,....Initially I applied twice a day, but now I use it once a day..but please do NOT use or apply it on the area where there is no darkness, it will bleach and the skin may peel off. So be careful while applying...</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me :/</li>
    <li> Used this on my face for 4 weeks and it worked! My acne cleared up and the dark spots. So I will definitely buy the soap. I was skeptical at first cuz I am darker skin. Proactiv, neutrogena, mary kay, none of that stuff helped me. But this has. You just have to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I applied it on my underarms, elbows, knees, face, neck and chest. The label said it is good for blackheads and acne so I decided to apply it also on my face, neck and chest. BIG MISTAKE! I used it as instructed, 2x a day (morning and night). After one month of use (two tubes later), it totally burned my skin, gave me red itchy bumps around my underarms, severe acne breakout all over my face and neck and chest that look like I have Chicken pox! Very, very itchy! My skin, to begin with, isn&#x27;t bad. I occasionally get pimples here and there but never this severe. Now I need to find a good dermatologist to help me solve this problem. I am an Asian woman with yellow undertone skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had very dark underarms for a while now, and have tried many creams to lighten them. The brightening gel definitely works! it does take its time, however, but it does work! I saw some major improvement in my underarms, and now I am extremely happy they are lighter. I do have to purchase another gel but that&#x27;s fine because I know this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nothing else has worked for you, I recommend trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use it everyday, sometimes twice a day (morning and night) and saw results after about 2 weeks. After a month I could see more improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
    <li> The ingredient in this product that causes the skin to lighten is called Hydroquinone. It is a known cancer causing ingredient both in the skin and in the bodies organs. It has been banned in many countries across the globe. I highly recommend you do not use it! It is absolutely unsafe and Amazon should not even sell it in my opinion. Read this: Health Concerns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydroquinone works by decreasing the production of melanin pigments in the skin. Because the chemical lightens skin by reducing melanin, it simultaneously increases exposure to UVA and UVB rays deep in the skin (iv). This increases skin cancer risks due to UV exposure, in addition to the carcinogenic effects of the chemical itself. The chemical is allowed in personal care products in the United States in concentrations up to 2 percent. Although banned in the European Union, a UK news report found that products containing hydroquinone were relatively easy to procure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The U.S. Cosmetics Ingredient Review Panel indicates that hydroquinone is unsafe for use in products that are left on the skin (v,vi), but due to lax enforcement, directions for skin lightening products containing hydroquinone encourage frequent and consistent use on the skin (vii).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database, which compares cosmetic ingredients to more than 50 international toxics databases, identifies hydroquinone as a carcinogen, immunotoxicant and developmental and reproductive toxicant, and also identifies concerns regarding the ingredient&#x27;s risks for various organ systems, the endocrine system and neurotoxicity (viii).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to concerns about long-term toxicity, hydroquinone is linked to a skin condition called ochronosis in which the skin becomes dark and thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m black, light skinned, and I&#x27;ve had dark underarms ever since puberty. I don&#x27;t know whether that is hormonal or from using aluminum antiperspirant. It seems to be an issue alot of people are having problems with. To try to lessen the problem, I only wax my underarms...shaving causes too much irritation. Well, I ordered two tubes of this gel in late November 2011 after watching a review on youtube, and it has really lightened my skin! My underarms are almost the same color as the rest of my skin now. It&#x27;s so exciting to know that there is something that works. I thought I would be trapped forever. Now I can wear tanks and sleeveless dresses.  I don&#x27;t have to limit myself as to what I can wear. It is really liberating!</li>
    <li> Like most people commenting, I bought this gel because, thanks to shaving and using deodorant, my underarms had developed a weird, greenish gray tint to them (gross!). After doing some research, this product seemed to be the best thing for that - it&#x27;s also relatively cheap in comparison to some other products I&#x27;ve looked at.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this gel for a week and I ALREADY see an improvement. I am so impressed! Granted I use it 3x a day, which admittedly is a little excessive (once or twice should be plenty for most people), but I was eager to see if this stuff produced results and I&#x27;m happy to say that it does. I&#x27;ve used a little less than half of the tube now and the greenish gray tint has lightened considerably. I also bought the Xtreme Brite exfoliating soap to use on my underarms. I&#x27;m not sure if that helped or not but I love both products either way and will continue using both of them. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Helped my dark armpits a ton, I have been using for about a month and the are drastically different.  I have always and I mean always had dark armpits, almost like I didn&#x27;t wash...  I swear to you scrubbing them until they were almost raw.  Nothing worked I tried many facial product pore cleaning products etc.  I also felt that every deodorant on the planet final using the clinical strength secret.  But honestly almost immediately out of the shower I felt I could smell my armpits, and I shower sometimes 2 times a day.  This was always the most embarrassing part of my day to day life.  I couldn&#x27;t even begin to wear nylon or rayon as I would sweat sooo much more, so on a whim I decided to try to bleach them.  I showered and cleaned my armpits with an astringent (seabreeze) to make sure it was really clean and applied the product, slight tingling but totally tolerable.  I hadn&#x27;t but on anti antiperspirant/ deodorant  because I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work if I added that.  But a surprising this happened I barely sweated, I mean barely I couldn&#x27;t smell my sweat which I always can..  I have continued to use this and my armpits have gotten soooo much lighter I have ordered two more tubes.  Plus the fact that I am barely sweating and the smell has almost vanished. It&#x27;s truly been a miracle for me , I have also used this on my face and it has helped a ton with some discoloration and my pore size looks much smaller.  I totally think it&#x27;s worth the money.  I can&#x27;t guarantee everybody will have the same results has I did but if you do you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I am hispanic, medium skin tone and I have had really dark pigmentation on my underarms for as long as I can remember. My mom and sisters also...It took about 4 weeks to really see results but it does work! My skin did start to peel, but it was not painful. So when it started to peel I exfoliated my underarms and the dark skin seemed to just fall off! This is the only product that has actually worked for me :)</li>
    <li> I spent about $40 total on the xtreme bright gel and the xtreme bright exfoliating soap, and used it religiously with no results whatsoever. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I started using this product the last week of Feb 2012. I am not on my fourth tube and I will not be buying anymore. It bleached around the dark spots in my underarms but did not help with the actual dark spots. I have been using the product religiously in the morning and again at night. Sad it did not work for me as it did for others. Not I have whiteness surrounding my dark spots. Definitely nowhere near tank top ready. :[ I am Mexican.</li>
    <li> Pls don&#x27;t but this crap it will honestly just make you darker. These people are crazy are non-existant I&#x27;ve tried this, waist of money.</li>
    <li> Did not see any results. Plus was nasty, like KY Jelly!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products to lighten my underarms. Im hispanic and my underarms were extremely dark. The first 2 weeks of trying this product I saw a significant change in color in my underarms. Im on my second tube and there has been a drastic change! I hated to even lift my arms up or even wear sleeveless, but now Im so much more comfortable doing so. Im sure after this current tube my underamrs will be completely back to their natural tone. To be honest I really thought I would never find a solution to my problem, but I did. I applied this product on my underarms every night before bed (about the size of a dime for each underarm) and rubbed it in completely. I also would exfoliate my underarms a couple times a week. You will see results if you do this every night!! It has been about 2 months since I started using the product, so it does take time but the results are worth it! Just think, would you rather have dark underarms for a couple of months or the rest of your life...give it a try you will not be disappointed!! :)</li>
    <li> WOW! ive Never thought i wouldve gotten rid of dark underarms. My underarms were DARK! i am brown skin and my underarms were charcoal black. Extremely emabarrasing and i never use to lift up my arms. This darkness was caused by all the shaving i use to do and sharing deodorant with my mother and sister. Ive been using xtreme brite gel for a month now and the results are unbelievable. They are completely light now. Im going to use it for another month just to clear up just one small spot thats still a little darker, that spot is taking a little longer to clear up. Since its only a small area, i just use a qtip to apply to that AREA ONLY. I did go through peeling and redness the first 2 weeks but thats because my skin had to get use to the gel. I am so happy with the results. i can finally showoff my underarms, I recommend this product to ANYONE WHO IS SUFERRING FROM DARK UNDERARMS. TRUST ME, IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> Works better with lemon.</li>
    <li> I use this very occasionally on my nether regions which are slightly darker than the rest of my body. They have gotten lighter so I must say that its lightening properties are kind of effective. The results might be better if I had an actual routine instead of once a week/two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have looked around for products for the sure of dark under arms. I never wanted to take my shirt off, and never went swimming with out a shirt (YES, I&#x27;M A MALE.) everyone has flaws and this was one of mine, I&#x27;ve tried everything that seemed to work for other people. I&#x27;ve tried Waxing, Lemons, Mixtures of Natural herbs, and none worked. I keep comming back to this product, and thought long and hard about it. It took awhile for shipping but honestly it was worth the wait. I started seeing results within TWO days. I applied twice. once before i went to bed. I woke up the next day with lighter pits. It wasn&#x27;t The shade i want it to be yett but i know within a couple of more weeks it will look like nothing was ever there. If your thinking about buying this, go ahead and do it. YOU WILL BE VERY SURPRISED!! once again i know this product seems to be more for WOMEN because of the pink box and all the reviews are mainly women. LETS MAKE THIS CLEAR, I&#x27;M A MALE AND THIS PRODUCT WORKED FOR ME. one tube is not going to be enough, I&#x27;m already going to buy another tube. I&#x27;m telling everyone i know about this product, because it has done soo much for me already, I&#x27;m starting to feel more confident to walk around with no shirt. Don&#x27;t let dark under arms be one of your flaws, go ahead and order this. you will feel brand new again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
    <li> Very good product I love it</li>
    <li> Work good, but is no the best. shipping was fast and smells good, I&#x27;m using this product everyday and the results are good but not perfect.</li>
    <li> you have to put it on all day to work. my skin started to peel so I put lotion on after it drys. It does work, except the peeling. I hate that.</li>
    <li> Amazing! This stuff works wonders. I have been suffering from hyper pigmentation on my neck and I used this product as last resort. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it because it worked! Consistently put on the area twice a day (am and pm) for about 6wks. After 6wks I saw a dramatic difference. It&#x27;s not gone away completely but it&#x27;s about 85% better. I now apply once a day just to see if it continuous lighten. I&#x27;m almost out of the tube, contemplating whether I need another. I had no adverse effects but I do exfoliate every morning just to make sure my skin is nice and clean before applying.</li>
    <li> This product is THE product you would want to use if you have dark underarms. I have tanned (Indian) skin and I am using this now for months. I am using it with Dove gosleeveless underarm deo. And those are the only products that go on my underarm. I only wax and NEVER shave. And exfoliate my underarms with a loofah during my bath with dove body wash. I can now confidently wear sleeveless. :)</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I quit using it after 2 weeks.. Maybe it&#x27;s for someone else but not me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I purchased this a few weeks ago to lighten up the dark spots on my underarms (Yuck!). I have seen considerable change (lightening) and am ready to order more. I freakin&#x27; love it! ! !! ! ! !</li>
    <li> It was okay. It didn&#x27;t really lighten anything for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to take my time to write a review, but I just HAD to write one for this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ordered the 3 pack one because I was expecting to use it for awhile and thought I&#x27;d save myself the time and money by ordering the 3 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for about a month and a half. I used it twice daily, once in the morning and again at night when I got out of the shower. It didn&#x27;t bother me at first, I actually finished the first tube and started using my second tube. But one day I noticed that my underarms were red and itchy and there were all little bumps around the area I applied the gel. I stopped using the gel for about a week or two and my underarms were still red and itchy. I was hoping for this to work because I&#x27;ve been embarrassed for years by my dark underarms but they have made them worse!!! Now my underarms are so severely dry that it gets flaky. I apply lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret buying this product and now have 2 tubes of product leftover. What a waste! Really wish it worked for me.</li>
    <li> This is not working!!! False advertisement!!!The box contains the information regarding \\&quot;acne\\&quot; but not related to whitening. Amazon, please look into this. This is really disappointment!!!</li>
    <li> I have olive skin tone &amp; my underarm area was horribly blemished.. I used this product &amp; after 2 weeks my armpits were amazingly white &amp; looking great...I feel great.. I moisture the area with argan oil first &amp; then I put the xtreme brite gel. My skin has never look better:)</li>
    <li> The product is Making me darker after ther first tube, I hate this color now. Can you give my color back Xtreme?</li>
    <li> I really love this product after 7 days the dark spots on my face were light brown 7 more days later i could hardly see them my face is brighter so i will only use this gel three times aweek now instead of everyday.</li>
    <li> Used it for my dark underarms. I noticed a bit of lightening in the beginning but after the second week I had to stop using this product. It severely irritated my skin. It turned it red as if it was burned, and then the irritation turned really dark. Instead, I stopped shaving and started waxing, stopped using antiperspirants and use a natural deodorant, and used lemon to lighten my underarms. They&#x27;re lighter now because of the lemon. I&#x27;ll never use this product again. In the trash it went.</li>
    <li> I loved extremw bright. It works within 2 weeks and smell very nice... It might be small but smells and works good... I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to get dark spots cleared up...</li>
    <li> Just started.. We wikl see</li>
    <li> It works!  But I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it :-0. There is no ingredient list on the packaging.</li>
    <li> I got this gel because of a youtube video, crazy enough. The woman had really dark under arms and after awhile they brightened significantly. I saw comments saying it did work, and reviews saying the same thing, so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, the tube looks like a paint tube. You have to poke a hole for the gel to come out. But what I really didn&#x27;t like is that there were no instructions... not even \\&quot;visit out website on how to use this, and tips!, etc\\&quot;. So I have no idea if one should use a this lightly or as other brands say \\&quot;generously apply...\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have a problem with dark underarms, I&#x27;m 20 years old and I just never had confidence wearing sleeveless jerseys. You always see on television people with basically no under arm problems, or even your friends, and here you are stuck with dark looking arms for no apparent reason, and it&#x27;s embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about... a month or so, maybe less. I use it everyday AFTER I shower. I&#x27;ve been just applying my deodorant over it, but I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to have to switch to a non-aluminum deodorant or something, because I have heard aluminum contributes to darkness. Or just do what my grandma does (SHE HAS NO UNDER ARM PROBLEMS, YET I DO LOL!) and put lemon and water under my armpits, though that can be irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first when I used this for a week, I didn&#x27;t see much results. But then I started to really look and notice the area was brightening. It also looks natural (so far). My left under arm though doesn&#x27;t seem to have much improved but I sort of see brightening AROUND the darkened area... so I will update on how that goes. But so far, this does work. I&#x27;ve even showed my mom (lol) and she notices the area is much brighter and it wasn&#x27;t as ugly as it use to be. I&#x27;m confident with my right under arm but not my left underarm... so I could wear a sleeveless with only a right underarm haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING!!! YOU SHOULD READ THIS!!! ... But I must say, I would be scared to try this on my face. If you have had success with this, good for you. But one day I tried putting the gel under my arms after I epilated my under arms and IT BURNED SO BAD. It also left scrapping marks. Now, I&#x27;m an idiot for doing that. But I didn&#x27;t think it would be so harsh. I immediately washed it off and I haven&#x27;t had any ugly markings or anything. It disappeared after 2 days or so. But this thing is more harsh than it appears. If you have openings or cuts or anything, this WILL BURN AND LEAVE MARKS!!! If you have acne and you&#x27;ve popped your pimples or still have it severely, your open pores may burn like hell. I would not even attempt this on hormonal acne or anything, this might make it worse. I have acne actually, and I have scars. My acne has calmed down majorly, but before when I had just a small amount of acne, I tried to do something for my scars. It got worse and now I&#x27;m back to normal with even more scars... my advice, just leave your scars alone if you&#x27;ve suffered so much pain trying to get rid of them. Maybe if you find something really gentle, give it a shot. But a lot of things nowadays are HARSH and ABRASIVE. It makes everything worse. Just take it from me. My face is okay now but PAIN IS BEAUTY. THAT&#x27;S ALL I GOTTA SAY ABOUT THAT!! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you shave your under arms, you are also asking for trouble if you want to use this gel. This will burn the hell out of your under arms and leave more marks if you apply this after shaving or something. You&#x27;d have to wait a few days to even apply this. If you want to get rid of under arm darkness I suggest you WAX or EPILATE anyway. I have to Emjoi epilator (sold on amazon too), and for 2 years of using this, my under arm darkness also lightened significantly because I wasn&#x27;t shaving constantly and irritating my skin. Shaving can contribute to under arm darkness too!!! When I stopped shaving I saw a MASSIVE improvement. Then this gel just makes it better. BUT again, you&#x27;re asking for trouble if you put this on irritated, broken skin or anything that was just shaven, waxed, epilated, or is just sensitive in general. BECAREFUL!!!</li>
    <li> OK, so I first found this product through a girl on Youtube, I was looking for an underarm product that would help with Hyperpigmentation (dark underamrs). I started with this problem, I beleive when I first started shaving my under arms back in the days, when I was a teenager. It wasnt bad until I notice that in my early adulthood It got worse.So on Youtube I saw that this girls, before and after results. I decided to give the product a try. I first bought the product at the beginning of May 2012, and its been alomost a month, and have seen great results. The product takes time I have seen with my personal experience, but it really does work. My daughter has seen my improvements also. I am really happy with it, and will be ordering some more again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: My personal experience is that when I use this product in the morning after I shower, I dont need to use deodorant all day anymore. There is something about this product that prevents odor from your under arms when you apply it. If I dont use the product, and Im running around all day, I do notice that (oviously) I do sweat and I have odor come out.) hope this helps</li>
    <li> I AM FURIOUS!!! I took down my 5 stars to 1 (I wish there was a NEGATIVE 10 because thats what it deserve)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the product for just 2 days and holy wow my Underarms are much MUCH worst. It has gotten even DARKER and now it has this dark streaks that looks like stretchmarks..and they are around my underarms so it shows even with a tshirt. I waited a little bit hoping it would go away but I have waited for way too long it looks like it is there to stay, I AM Furious beyond belief that I want to sue this company.. Wow, I will leave my previews review which I got nothing but good to say just so you know I really tried this product and I was honest. I&#x27;m glad it worked for some people but I also saw some reviews with similar problems - got darker and resulted dark stretchmarks. I need to see my dermatologist immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST/OLD REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may say, that I may be the most skeptical person to ever buy this product. First I thought that Youtube video must be fake, there&#x27;s no way her underarms could WHITEN (not lighten), WHITEN that MUCH for a short period of time. Also, the lady never made new videos after that dark underarm video. I checked out the website and it looked unprofessional, playing mariah carey&#x27;s hiphop song. -_-. And after reading all the amazon reviews, mostly everyone only had good stuff to say about it and I thought maybe the company itself made multiple accounts to make good reviews. I know, a little too skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I am sooo so happy I bought this product. Like many others, I started getting dark underarms (....that may be an understatement.. I had CHARCOAL color underarms, and I am light skinned asian), which started when I was pregnant. 3 years later I still have it and I tried lemon, turmeric, epilator, papaya soap, all kinds of other whitening out there from palmers to non-FDA approved products from other countries. NOTHING happened, it only exacerbated the dark pigmentations in my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started seeing results within 2 days, no exaggeration. 3 weeks later, my underarms are now the same color, if not, lighter than the rest of my body. I also stopped using deodorants because this does work as an antiperspirant - although it doesn&#x27;t last 24 hours like other deodorants. I suffered dark underarms for way too long. I used to never raise my arms, I still wore sleeveless clothes before but I use my hair to hide my underarms. Now, I am a little too enthusiastic about my arms that I raise it too often and needlessly. My underarms is so white now that I can see my veins under my skin, again, I am not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my face but it doesn&#x27;t work the way I hope it would. It only bleached the perimeter of my hyper-pigmentation spots, now it looks like my acne scars have halos and they are very noticeable. I believe the reason is that the scar is too tough for it to lighten, whereas the surrounding skin is much easier. Even when applied precisely and only on the spot, it still spreads on its own and lighten the surrounding skin. The halo disappears, however, within 2 days of none-use. So it worries me that the lightening may fade in my underarms when I stop using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed some skin peeling. But the peeling is very smooth, such that the skin peels are almost powdery in consistency. So, your skin will not look like patches of fresh skin and peeling dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER DOWN SIDES: Using papaya soap concurrently with this product BURNED my skin to the point that I can&#x27;t even move my arms. And the next day, it became Much darker, and skin felt like leather. So I suggest not to use other whitening products concurrently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also made my skin too sensitive probably caused by the peeling. Do not shave or scrub your skin because it might peel your skin off or cause breakage and inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I have never spend this much time and effort reviewing a product. I am happy with my purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do not see hydroquinone on the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may be too good to be true so it might have some harmful ingredients. I have yet to speak with my dermatologist. Since my arms are already white as I wished, I will only be using this once a week as to avoid any possible harmful effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tube lasted me 2 1/2 weeks using it in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received my 3 tube order recently and I will be trying it on my stretchmarks, wish me luck! and I will update you with my results,, If I remember it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good day and I hope it works for you too, and for those who were unsuccessful, I hope you find one that works, I know how hyper-pigmentation affects our daily lives, our self-esteem, and eventually, our health. Good luck to everyone! :)</li>
    <li> I used this product. It realy worked.i went from dark skin to carmel. I wish the tubes were bigger.</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertised and I went through 4 tubes, waste of money. Might work for others but not for me.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my inner thighs hoping to clear up a little discoloration. I used about half of the tube in a week and a half and had to stop immediately. My skin was peeling, red and irritated. Even a simple shower became uncomfortable. I stopped using the product as soon as I realized I was peeling. It took about 2 and a half weeks after that for the peeling and irritation to stop. I never saw results, possibly because I stopped using the product after such a short period of time. This product may work on other areas better.</li>
    <li> I am a black man that has suffered with discoloration on my neck due to wet shaving. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for two weeks, about twice daily and I&#x27;m noticing that my skin is indeed lightening!!! I can already see spots that have turned back to my natural color. I&#x27;m shocked! I also use this stuff on my face every once in a while to help with toning and I&#x27;m seeing improvements there as well. I would recommend ex-foliating the area you&#x27;re going to apply the gel on prior to  actually putting the gel on, and to put a decent amount of the gel on. I&#x27;m about to order more of this stuff as we speak because the 1oz gel is fairly small.</li>
    <li> SO, I bought this item with my hopes up waited a week. I feel like I got tricked. Maybe it did work but I&#x27;m not going to take much of a risk because of the fact that when I do vigorous activity I can FEEL myself sweating. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I need other underarm lighting suggestions. Please help. I feel hopeless. It does smell good but protection.. not so much.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to work as well or as fast as it has. I have used it on my elbows, armpits and face and I love the results! It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin as I expected and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. There was a noticeable difference with just a week of use.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a product that will brighten up certain parts of my body. I came across this product on youtube and I heard some good reviews. So I decided to try it for myself. First 3 days and I can tell the difference. The gel one works better than the cream one. I can&#x27;t wait for the full results. So far..happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have dark marks in my inner thigh and bikini area I wanted to lighten/whiten. I&#x27;m a mid-20s African American girl and when I scar from razor bumps or ingrown hairs it leaves dark marks that I really wanted to get rid of. I bought this because of all the great reviews and have been using it morning and night for about 2 weeks now and have NOT noticed any change whatsoever. I&#x27;ve been exfoliating the area before hand as well. Just wanted to leave this honest review, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe this will help someone else make up their mind.</li>
    <li> After first hearing about this product on YouTube, I was skeptical.  Having dark armpits for most of my adulthood I have tried everything-from home remedies like tumeric paste to using fresh leomons, nothing worked.  I&#x27;m getting married and have a sleeveless dress that I was ashamed to wear because of the dark pigmentation under my arms.  I have now been using this product consitently twice a day for 5 wks and have noticed a tremendous difference.  It has lightened my skin so much that I am going to cut back to once a day.  The greatest thing about this product too is that it doesn&#x27;t damage your clothing!  Now 10 days before my wedding, I am excited to put on my flattering sleeveless dress.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Extreme Brite Brightening gel on my underarms for about a week and a half and they are noticeably lighter and I haven&#x27;t needed deodorant a single day since. I have been waxing my underarms, which helps with the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; look, and helps reduce irritation and bumps caused by shaving, leaving them smoother and fresher longer. I am still needing to wax every week or so, but the results are so worth it. Highly recommend using this product two to three times a day for faster brightening results.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product on my dark elbows and little dark spots on my face for about 4 weeks now. Its not as dark as it was 4 weeks ago. The spots on my face are very light now. Im happy with this product. I use this product every single night. I usually use it a night or on days when I know Im not going outside. I put a little on my elbows and use a q-tip for the little spots on my face and let it dry. It does take time and you have to use sunscreen when you go outside. Make sure to use lotion after the product since the area(s) you&#x27;re using the product on gets really dry. Overall Im really happy with this product. It does exactly what it says. Its a skin brightener and its safe to use if you use it correctly. And of course, be patient. A little goes a long way. Almost done with tube 1, ordered my 2nd tube for my armpits.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. I bought it because I read some really good reviews on it. I bought it because i&#x27;m getting married in april and hate how dark my under arms are and thought this would work .IT DID NOT UNDERARMS JUST AS DARK AS BEFORE USED IT FOR OVER A MONTH WITH ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it very much. Be careful because it can burn your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it, because It hurt me</li>
    <li> it did clear up the area I needed but after continued use it darkened the area, I wasn&#x27;t even done with the little tube when those dark patches started to appear,, it may vary in each person but personally it made my situation worse...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for stubborn burn marks on the chin or dark marks from popping pimples on the face. What a waste of money. Seen better results with Ambi. Guess I&#x27;ll have to just continue using that for now.</li>
    <li> disappointment , did not do anything and ive use two tubes for many weeks now, idk maybe its just my skin ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a medium skin toned African American. I used this product to lighten my armpits and it really works!! I saw a major difference after 2 weeks! I just bought my second tube and the darkness that used to be under my arms is almost completely gone! I can&#x27;t believe I finally found a product that works!! I highly recommend you try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it 2-3 times a day and used a shower brush to really scrub my armpits when I showered. I only shaved once every other week. I also did not wear deodorant with the product. The gel works fine as deodorant and keeps me fresh the whole day.</li>
    <li> Bought this to lighten the elbows but wasn&#x27;t impressed</li>
    <li> Works alright but I didnt get great results.</li>
    <li> Hello. My wife wants to know if what do you need to use first the deodorant or the gel? She bought the crystal deodorant without aluminum. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I think a lot of the reviewers can say that they&#x27;ve first heard about this product from Krcoleman1983&#x27;s YouTube video, I know I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned by trial and error with this product. I initially bought it for my knees and some acne discolorations on my face. I initially used it twice daily on both areas, and what it did was actually make my discolorations worse! My skin peeled, turned kinda raw and irritated, and that made the skin even darker than it was before. I was just about done with this product, until I decided to use it in moderation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it once daily and sometimes every other day, and my God did I start to see improvement! This product is the first fading/brightening product that has actually ever worked for me. I haven&#x27;t worn skirts or shorts for most of my life because of my dark knees and Xtreme Brite completely diminished that. For the first time this summer I&#x27;ll be able to show my legs and it&#x27;s really life changing. Also, my acne marks are completely gone! My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in such a long time! This product in itself is life changing and it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my final advice is to use it once daily, DO NOT OVERUSE THIS!! It will irritate your skin and make it work because it is very strong! Also i suggest to spot it, dont apply it to areas that dont need it because it will lighten your regular skin. Just use in moderation and watch those marks fade away :D</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 3 WEEKS NOW ON MY ELBOWS, BUT I DON&#x27;T SEE ANY GOOD RESULTS YET.</li>
    <li> One thing that I have not seen mentioned is that this gel does not just \\&quot;bleach\\&quot; the skin but it actually causes your skin to peel away the damage.  My skin was peeling and so the texture underneath it was smoother as well as lighter.  If it just whitened it, my skin would have been rough still from the damage of shaving.  The entire texture has changed and is dramatically smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is effective but please look into the ingredients, some of which are toxins. Saw results in 3 weeks.  Dramatic changes but some ingredients aren&#x27;t safe.</li>
    <li> This product works far beyond expectation. I&#x27;ve been using it about 4 days with my normal Clearasil pads for acne and rash from my medications. I have dark skin, the scars began to fade but it&#x27;s lightened my skin a bit too, noticeably. It has a light pleasant scent and its not sticky like I thought a gel would be. It came in the mail very fast. It was ordered out of frustration of dealing with patches of darker scars, so I am happy that I found something to use. I didn&#x27;t expect for this product to lighten my skin, but I know to be careful now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand anyone who says it doesn&#x27;t work. I think it has to be used with something else or just pre-wash the skin well. That is all I have been doing, just apply it after I clean my face 2x a day and it is not causing me any additional acne or irritation. Living on numerous medications can ruin the complexion for sure, so I think I&#x27;ve finally created a good combination that works for my skin because Proactive sure didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> i had darkening due to a pregnancy and it worked... I used used it twice a day for about a month and everything was my normal skin tone. I am not sure if you need to keep using it, I now apply it every once in a while ....</li>
    <li> This product actually works. I&#x27;ve gone through just one tube and I&#x27;ve seen considerable whitening of my underarms. Using this with Toms deo. I have naturally dark brown skin, but my underarms used to be pretty embarrassingly dark. Not anymore :)&lt;br /&gt;Summer, here I come!</li>
    <li> First of all, I am really happy for those who found the product useful. But for me, i wished i never used it. it simply turned my armpit into red circles which eventually peeled by itself, and turned made it even darker than before. I am really disappointed</li>
    <li> Love this product, works very effectively</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me to well after a couple of months of usage; I am an medium brown toned African American with black spots from pimples...</li>
    <li> Works all long as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Really doesn&#x27;t remove completely&lt;br /&gt;Sticky!</li>
    <li> So I bought this for my underarms which doesn&#x27;t work that great. (I&#x27;m a light skinned mixed with Hispanic n white) but did brighten n make my nipples super soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product, twice a day for almost 3 weeks on my ankles: I have dark spots from 3 ant bites; a blemish on my right cheek and forehead; and my armpits. I have noticed no lightening whatsoever. I&#x27;ve used skin bleaching creams over the years with greater success (of course they&#x27;re most costly), but I now realize, when it comes to bleaching creams, you get what you pay for. Vantex by fashion fair and Black &amp; White works MUCH better &amp; they&#x27;re worth the money. I guess this is what I get for trying to save money! Lol. Do yourself a favor &amp; invest in a better product. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> Horrible!!! Made my skin peel and darken.. Waste of money and didn&#x27;t lighten my face! Doesn&#x27;t even have ingredients so you know it&#x27;s dangerous</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product. I received it fast and it was packaged well I really appreciate how fast it was delivered and on time. It seems to be working ,and if I plan to return to get more! I  Service was great and I have no complaints with the Order. Thank you for quick and safe packaging. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a  difference.&lt;br /&gt;I just like the price.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference at all with this product. I used a whole tube and never noticed any changes</li>
    <li> The product is working, just a whole lot slower than I thought it would. Not too happy with the results right now.</li>
    <li> I have embarrassing dark marks on my inner thighs, and that&#x27;s the main reason I bought this product. I&#x27;ve tried other products and they were always too greasy to leave on during the day, but this stuff is not, and I love it for that reason! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week straight now twice a day and I&#x27;m seeing results already...I&#x27;m excited because every other bleaching product I&#x27;ve used definitely hasn&#x27;t worked this fast. I am also using the good ol&#x27; lemon juice treatment, and it seems to work well with the product. Just about to order another tube! I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this on 4th Jan and received the order in 2 days on 6th jan which by itself was impressive. Started using it during the nights from 6th and i can see a lot of difference. i bought this to whiten my underarms which were quite dark and i had pores as well...when i noticed them today, i hardly see the pores and find the underarms reasonably whitenend. I bought 2 tubs and the first is nearly ending. If i could so much difference in the first itself, sure i wud find more noticable difference on completing the 2nd. Im planning to use this product some more time and concentrate on area by area due to improper tanning. This is pretty cool product and to say &#x27;the cheap one which really works&#x27;!! instead of spending 40-50$ on store products, try this one first, atleast you wont repend your decisions. Im aware many people did not find it effective and sorry for that. But, just to mention that my skin was rough in those areas are rough earlier and now its so so smooth. Just to include that my skin wont listen even to well-versed medications but did respond to this. I would recommend this product to everyone. Apply in the required area and allow it to dry for a while and then wear ur clothes. The smell is awesome..</li>
    <li> After using this product I developed a horrible itchy red burning rash under both armpits. And now my underarms look  worse :(... I wish, I never bought this gel!</li>
    <li> Did not work. Darkened area further instead of whitening. Not a good product. Nice scent though but otherwise a zero.</li>
    <li> I ordered this date on May 27, 2013. Over 2 years later, I still have stretch marks on my underarms because of this gel. Also, it didnt help brighten my underarm skin whatsoever. Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It smells extremely good.&lt;br /&gt;There is no leftover sting feel in the hands after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;If I sweat, there was no sweat, so I felt like it acted like a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It did not do what it says it would.&lt;br /&gt;There are also no instructions whatsoever! Like do you apply it twice a day, In the morning, night?&lt;br /&gt;I applied it at night which is, after a lot of research from different online sources, recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Reading some of the reviews, you might have to do it long term to get results, so I was thinking of ordering it again to see if there is any changes. So far, it has not done anything!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews prior to purchasing this product.  But within two weeks of using the soap along with the gel there was a noticeable positive difference in my skin tone and quality.  My skin color is dark brown and has a tendency to develop in-grown hair which then leaves dark marks.  Further, I moved to a new climate/environment in the last two and a half years which proved to have a negative effect on my skin as well.  I&#x27;d been using a more expensive product (something that I may go back to again) but this product along with the soap has been a great first step in helping feel that I can look and admire my face in the mirror again.  I use the soap once or twice a day to  exfoliate; leaving the suds to dry for about 5 minutes.  Then I rinse in tepid water, use witch hazel and then the gel.</li>
    <li> it work well for my  skin.It look more light after i used it for 1 month. but i just used it at night time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is POWERFUL, no joke. I&#x27;ve been using for a little over 5 weeks, and my armpits are significantly lighter. I figure by the end of this second tube, I won&#x27;t need to use the Gel any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to armpit use, I have two tips: 1) be patient 2) don&#x27;t overapply.  I made the mistake originally that if I use lots, it would be more effective. Instead, I gave myself bumpy irritation on my pits.  I laid off and only use two pea-sized amounts per armpit, and I gently rub it in until it&#x27;s been fully absorbed.  Please note that I used 2 pea sized amounts because my pit discoloration went all the way up my inner arm, and all the way down to where my bra was.  That&#x27;s a lot of skin to cover.  I applied the gel twice a day: in the morning and in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning after the gel has absorbed into my skin, I apply Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant which is aluminium free.  Stay away from antiperspirants! it just makes your skin irritated; stick to a natural, aluminum free deodorant. Yeah, you&#x27;ll be sweaty, but it&#x27;s clean sweat, not stinky.  You will also notice that you won&#x27;t need to slather on the deodorant: I think the gel helps keep the bacteria down so you don&#x27;t get  B.O..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 weeks ago, I also used this on my face (1 pea sized amount of gel mixed with 3 short pumps of the oil of olay regenerist serum) to help with my face. Unfortunately, because I never used to wear sunblock, my face was always 3-4 shades darker than the rest of my body, plus I had all this dark, hyperpigmentation around my mouth that made me look like I was growing a beard or something.  I also used this at night (1-3 ratio of gel and oil of olay regenerist night cream).  In about 2 weeks, my skin is glowing, and is the same color as my neck/chest.  Now I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing foundation that&#x27;s 4 shades too dark.  I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using the gel/moisturizer combo on my face: but I do make sure I wear sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Update June 22,2012&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m halfway done with my 4th tube for my armpits and I have to say that I think this is as light as it&#x27;s going to get.  My left pit has lightened to almost the same color as the rest of my skin, but my right is not as awesome.  It&#x27;s much, MUCH lighter than when I started out, but it&#x27;s not as good a result as the left.  I&#x27;m still using the gel as part of my daily routine, but I think I&#x27;ve plateaued.  I&#x27;m still VERY pleased with the product: I can actually wear short sleeves and cap sleeves as the gel has lightened my armpits enough that the hyperpigmentation is localized in the pits, not spread down my inner arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions I keep getting asked: is this permanent?  The answer, in my case, is no. It&#x27;s NOT permanent.  My facial hyperpigmentation came back about 3-4 weeks after I stopped using the gel on my face, but apparently, it&#x27;s a hormonal problem and not necessarily just a skin issue.  I use the Oil of Olay + Gel mix once a day now to keep things even and is also part of my skin routine, but I know that if I stopped using the gel, the hyperpigmentation will come back.  I wear a sunscreen (I use Kiehls superfluid, but that has started to make me break out, so I&#x27;m going back to neutrogena drytouch 30SPF) on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also get asked: what is my racial background? I am Filipina, my skin tone is medium light:  not east asian pale, but not completely tan either.</li>
    <li> I used this gel to lighten my under arms i did a before and after video on YouTube. Krcoleman1983. It really does work!!</li>
    <li> I am a black woman and had terrible dark underarms from excessive sweating and shaving. I gave  this a  try and OMG it is a miracle. I rub it twice a day every day and after two tubes, my under arms are beautiful. I also had terrible dark knees. they were so dark that if a take a pic with shorts on the only thing will draw attention was them. there were three shades darker than my whole body complection, so  I did the same, rub the creme twice a day and I just cant believe how even they look now. I still have to use it maybe one more tube for both my knees and under arms and I will achieve my perfect goal. Dont bother on DAGGETT&amp; RAMSDELL UNDER ARM OR KNEE CREAM,  they did nothing to me, just a wastage of my money. this creme works amazingly fast. I also tried around my eyes, it removed my undereyes darkness, just be careful. I gave it a four star only because I wish they could make bigger tubes, that will make it easier to buy one big thing that lasts for months,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and oh something else, if you have dark spots, just apply directly to them, I had a lot of them on my upper arms and back, it is a bit challenging to try rub it on these small spots but it pays off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  UPDATE!!&lt;br /&gt;  THE RESULTS ARE NOT PERMANENT!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok I had to come back to give an update. I gave this product a really good review because it really works miracles. it cleaned my under arms really well as well as my knees, so I stopped using it and in just a matter of one week, my under arms are worst than before, they are so dark and the color is like ashy black or something that I cant even explain. I thought I was the only one who is experiencing this but I saw another update like this. so does it mean we have to continue use this thing for like forever? I dont want to use chemicals on my skin for a long period of time. I tried to rub inn some lemon every day but nothing is helping as my under arms are also very sensitive now. I am going to buy it again maybe and then use it maybe twice a week? does anyone else know what to do after u you&#x27;ve reached your goals? Im am beyond sad because it is summer now and very hot, I like wearing sleeve less tops and dresses.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with results</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t finish using  the gel yet but it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works ok. I will keep continue using it to see the result.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product. I bought it based off of the good ratings and reviews. Within two to three days of using it, I broke out on my chin!</li>
    <li> I just received it but there are absolutely no instructions on the box or in the packaging. This is a problem that should be fixed.</li>
    <li> It works quickly! Continued use is not recommended because after using have the tube, there were no more changes to skin color.</li>
    <li> It made my underarms peel, sting and gave me a rash after i stoped using it, save your money &amp; do NOT BUY!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me at first. But if you use it faithfully u will see results. Like more then two weeks use it for a month. And be careful it will dry you out and make you skin very very irritated use oil free lotion under your arm  like face lotion and it will help</li>
    <li> this stuff really works ,its only been three days and i can see the difference, my armpit looks better than when i started .</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical that this product wuldnt work. I had a acne mark on my chin and it basically cleared that up in about 3 weeks time I&#x27;m really surprised by that. I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic change in my skin color though.  I have a birthmark on my forehead I really hate and I&#x27;m trying to get rid of it. I haven&#x27;t noticed any lightening on that but I will give a update in a couple months.</li>
    <li> This product truly works, be careful as other reviewers mention ( whatever u apply this too instead of it lightening the dark it will start lightening the outer surface of the problem area ,making it look like a halo) I will continue to use product in small amounts with a q-tip. It really does work ,I only apply it day and night and already see result . Had for about 2 weeks. Dark area Is gradually fading!</li>
    <li> This product is one of a kind.  I was a little skeptical at first, but after it arrived and it arrived quickly, I applied it prior to bed and woke up with results.  I&#x27;ve never had a product that worked so quickly and continues to improve daily.  I am African American and my face was darker than the rest of my body.  I&#x27;ve had the product for going on two weeks and I already see major results.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.  After a few uses though, be sure to apply moisturizer to protect the skin.  If purchased, you will know what I&#x27;m getting at.  WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND-</li>
    <li> The fact that the product does not have the ingredients label scared me but I still decided to give it a go since people have reported results. However, I only used it about 2-3 weeks (and not consistently).  This product has some harsh extreme alright ...ingredients. I used it on my underarm.  The texture of the skin looked like it was losing elasticity. The discoloration was not improving but getting darker. And the skin around the discoloration was getting lighter. The change of the texture of my skin was the factor that made me discontinue its use. I THINK THIS PRODUCT BREAKS DOWN THE COLLAGEN IN THE SKIN. I would not recommend using this gel. First of all, WE DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT IS IN IT. WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT. THE RESULT IS NOT WORTH THE RISK.  I stopped using it about a month now. Thank God my underarm looks somewhat like it did before. Also, I notice that I was perspiring more than before. I will never buy anything that does not have a label.</li>
    <li> The worst thing i ever used on my skin. My skin was peeling off after 2 days . I immediately Stopped using it</li>
    <li> Whitened the whiter areas and no noticeable difference in areas that are actually dark. 3 stars because lightening on whiter areas mean that the product works. Logically, this would mean the darker areas are also lightening but needs more application and or longer use to see difference in colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars is a fair rating for 1 month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: patience and more money.</li>
    <li> I tried it on my underarms and it made a slight difference. It did lighten it up just a tad bit.. Im kind of just glad that it worked at all! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I am shocked.  It&#x27;s actually working.  I have a mark/scar that has been present for a while.  I&#x27;ve used lemon juice to no avail.  The mark/scar  is now SIGNIFICANTLY lighter after using this product for one month.  (Its not a keloid, its one of those flat but dark colored scars).  Smells nice, easy to use.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this or any other lightening gel for long term, but for what I&#x27;m using it for, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and does the job, I apply it to my knees and elbows and the results are fabulous.  I reccommend this product for anyone to try.  Ive ordered several tubes and it is affortable.</li>
    <li> very bad product, don&#x27;t recommended to my fiend</li>
    <li> Non African American; made areas of skin where I directly applied gel, flaky from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;This was within two days of, once a day application.&lt;br /&gt;No noticeable changes of continued use for almost two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Had to discontinue use due to persistent flaking of skin and overall loss of health of my skin.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this. It truly doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt; work! This product made my problem twice as bad. Trust me Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I used as directed, still didn&#x27;t get any results but it does help out with break outs when you put a little on the pimple.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m Hispanic with medium tan skin.. Works wonders! I tried to use it on my thighs but that didn&#x27;t work, I wish it worked for there also.</li>
    <li> I have permanent scarring on my arms because of this. I lost muscle in certain areas so now I have permanent burn marks that look like stretch marks. It went from white to red then turned into dark scarring. I can no longer wear tank tops because it&#x27;s noticeable. If I could attach a photo I would.</li>
    <li> Did nothing, not worth the money. made my skin dry and flaky. did not lighten or brighten my skin at all. plus they don&#x27;t list their ingredients. shady.</li>
    <li> I use this product day and night for a month and my skin don&#x27;t change, this product no work on me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any results. But to be fare I didn&#x27;t use it as often as I should had so maybe that&#x27;s why idk</li>
    <li> Point blank...It works. I am a brown skinned african american woman and I have been using this product for all of my dark spots. On my knees, elbows, under arms and spot on my face. I use this at night under my underarms and put deodorant on in the morning. My arms have cleared up in 2 weeks. I put a little on the dark spot on my face every other day and that has cleared up soon. I will be getting another soon when this tube runs out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Great it worked well. Used 1 tube &amp; it lightened up my underarms right away. Very Happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It works but the results are only temporary. I used it for my underarms and I got results fast but you have to continue using it because the skin goes dark again. I have to say that the skin will peel off and be red for a few days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only user this product for a month and I have to say that it really surprised me. My underarm area were really dark and I&#x27;ve tried other brighteners and even a chemical peel to lightening them, but after continues use of this product I am happy to say that I&#x27;ve noticed amazing results!!! I am going to order another tube and use it to lightening a little bit more.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me bought 2 tubes hoping to see lighter underarms but nothing it made my skin peels. Smells good can be used a deodorant after shower.</li>
    <li> I have the middle age problem of dark patches on my face, arms, and my underarms form shaving. I stumbled across this and thought it a low price point versus going to the dermatologist &amp; took a chance. When I got the box, I noticed it remarked on the acne/blackhead clearing properties. Given that my chin and nose have always been problematic when it comes to that (i decongest the area and 2 days later they&#x27;re all back) i tried some on my chin that night as a test. When i checked in the morning.....THE BLACKHEADS WERE 90% GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am astounded. It has been working well on my liver spots, too, but it can be very drying and make the skin peel, so careful when you start.</li>
    <li> i got this producs and  star usining i have to say tha i like the very second time i put under my harms was very clear i notice the diferentmi recoment this produts  i will buy another becouse its work for me</li>
    <li> It was an okay product. I still have some left since I do not use it every day, so it was a reasonable price for the amount of product I received.</li>
    <li> Only problem kinda a big price for such a small tube</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet, still trying to be optimistic. It does dry the skin out a little and did work on lightening a scar I had  on my face</li>
    <li> I bought this cream and it darkened my skin even worse more than that my skin started to peel. I stopped using it after two weeks because my skin was getting damaged from the cream. If you have sensitive skin I don&#x27;t recommend you buy this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not buying this ever again</li>
    <li> this product is very strong and  it does not have the ingredients listed and i will not recomend it to no one because of the lack of ingredients on the tube</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for the dark areas I have in my body specially on my knees and nothing was working but after I tried this product with the Brite Brightening Soap I am very happy. only after few days I started to see the deference. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great did work while i was using but i stopped cuz im little lazy too do it every day yup</li>
    <li> Good, along with using another product also seems to do better with it then by it self. Probably get it again.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all...money wasted...don&#x27;t buy this product you won&#x27;t get any results we&#x27;ll at least I didn&#x27;t get any</li>
    <li> Very much happy and will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> I used this for a while on my underarms and it did lighten them but after a couple of uses it started to make my skin peel on my armpits! it honestly looked like i was transforming to a tan mexican to an extremely white person. It did make my underarms very white but the peeling looked so weird. I kept applying it but it started to burn my skin pretty bad. It has very harsh chemicals in it so i would take a lot of PRECAUTION. I wouldn&#x27;t use this again bc it doesn&#x27;t seem safe at all and it is very harsh on your skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After i topped using it made my armpits look even darker.&lt;br /&gt;if you are mexican or have dark skin i would not use!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. DIdnt work on me</li>
    <li> Used on my under arms. Worked ok. you have to use everyday in order to see minimal results. it does sting after waxing or shaving so be careful with that. my results were 40% on a 100% scale of being &amp;#34;whitened&amp;#34;. Will have to continue use this product and eliminate deodorants or products with aluminum in them. I may order another tube and try. but haven&#x27;t in a year.</li>
    <li> I am a brown girl. I purchased this gel to lighten my armpits. After a week of using the gel my armpits became darker and additional black marks began to appear and spread. I exfoliated and switched to natural deodorant before using this gel. My armpits and the surrounding area now looks horrible. I am too embarrassed to wear certain dresses and tank tops because it is so visible. I noticed that this product has worked for other brown girls, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this for a week on a very stubborn spot on my foot which seems to lighten just a little bit or darken depending on the product I use.  I was a little scared to use since some of the users had problems with darkening of the skin using this but I see it getting lighter.  I&#x27;m hoping for the best.  I am putting it on the spot and my elbows every day, twice.  I have to say, I really like the smell and so far it seems like it will do the job.  Please remember when using a lightening cream, not to forget the sunblock since it will make matters worse if we don&#x27;t use.  My skin color is light- medium (light olive) for an idea.  I will write back within a month and I will change the rating depending on its efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update*** 7.1.14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is better than most for lightening.  I have not had any adverse reactions but I always use strong sun block.  My elbows have lightened significantly, they are probably one shad away from being the same tone as my skin.  As for the spot on my foot... It still won&#x27;t go away, it&#x27;s just slightly lighter but no big improvement :/.  4 stars sound about right.. ;)</li>
    <li> Its not expensive and after 2 weeks you can see results already, i use it at night time and it really works.. will buy refill</li>
    <li> Product worked for me started seeing results in 3 days its awsome &#x3D;). I tried many other products havent worked I recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Review is based on my personal experience: Used this product religiously &amp; it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Don&#x27;t want to imply that it&#x27;s incapable of producing results for others, but I took before &amp; after pictures to compare &amp; there was zero change.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it 2 starts b/c the scent wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> This cream is very good for me. After 3 weeks of using I was very happy because I got the result I want. I can raise up my hand without being concern with my underarm. I will definitely recommend it to a friend. Oops by the way I stop using it because I am satisfied with the result already and I still have half the amount of the tube.</li>
    <li> I only bought one tube of this so not really sure if it did anything or not! I bought this inconjuction to anotherroduct I did see results w... But this I used for areas of my body that are naturally darker and haven&#x27;t found the right product to fix that yet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several pimples on my forehead that left me with dark spots that I could not get rid of no matter what I tried. I tried Nadinola which caused my skin to turn red and irritated and resulted in darkening the spots even more. I also tried Menderma which seemed to work for a while but eventually began to darken the spots again. I should note that I always use sunblock, wear hats on sunny days, and exfoliate with microbeads and Clarisonic face brush. I also do exact spot treatment with a Qtip. Anyway, so I ordered Xtreme Brite in light of all the positive reviews in hopes that I would have better luck with this product. While awaiting shipment, I went to Wal-Mart and purchased &#x27;Ambi Skincare Fade Cream - for Normal Skin&#x27; for $4.97 (uses 2% hydroquinone and sunscreen) and I began to see results within about 4 days. I started to get excited with these results, especially when I received my Xtreme Brite hoping I could accelerate the results I was getting. I stopped using Ambi and switched over to Xtreme Brite and within 3 days, my spots were darker than before. I immediately stopped using the product and went back to Ambi. Ambi is already reversing the effects of Xtreme Brite within 4 days. Again, I concentrate Ambi using Qtips to place directly on each spot and not the surrounding area. It is a higher quality hydroquinone that does not irritate your skin like Nadinola which uses 2% hydroquinone also. I&#x27;m sure Xtreme Brite is great for underarms as the reviews tell, but I would be hesitant to advise anyone using this product on any part of their face. Proceed with caution...</li>
    <li> It worked, but weirdly my armpits went back to the dark color after I stopped it.&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid of the chemicals in it so I ditched it. Currently being exfoliating with my exfoliating gloves and it&#x27;s working pretty well, plus no chemicals!</li>
    <li> i never had acne until I started using this product</li>
    <li> I barely used this for one night and i already see difference im not kidding! I was very skeptical on buying this as i saw reviews that said it didnt work on many &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; girls or that it made it worse. I am hispanic with a tan complexion and i used this on my underarms and on my bikini line and i see it so much lighter in one night use! I also put it on a small dark pigmentation on my face but it still looks the same.. I guess i will have to wait for that one. But seriously so impressed at my underarms and bikini line! :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, but it smells nice. I brought it for my underarm. It seems to actually getting darker.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s on line product it&#x27;s exactly what you buy you got I will definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all, i just got burned!  I was expecting for something better, but sadly it didn&#x27;t fill my expectations.</li>
    <li> I used the product and it worked but once I stopped, my skin got irritated and itchy and now my skin is back to the same dark color it was. It works if you&#x27;re using it but when you stop, the dark color returns. It&#x27;s not a permanent thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2-3 weeks now and seems nothing&#x27;s happening..  Anyway, some reviews say it takes time before you see results... I&#x27;m giving it 2 months try and we&#x27;ll see how it goes... I&#x27;ll post another review by then....</li>
    <li> the product was ok, I have no problems with it I think I have to use it some more in order to give a quality ratings</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from darkening under my arm for more than 20 years and have never found anything that works until i tried extreme brite gel. I applied twice a day. morning and night for 2 month. i had amazing results!After 2 weeks my skin start to get red.... which is normal and it will peel.</li>
    <li> still waiting for it to work. It might take long time. but it fine i will wait.&lt;br /&gt;But it might be good product i guess??</li>
    <li> I used this product faithfully under my pits before bedtime and I didn&#x27;t notice the difference until a month after.  I don&#x27;t wear deodorant before bedtime to give my skin a break from the chemicals.  A month later, I noticed a significant difference and the dark spots from shaving are gone.  I&#x27;m not sure what happens if I quit using it, but for now, I&#x27;m happy that I can confidently wear sleeveless again.</li>
    <li> Saw a lot of girls using this product on youtube so I ordered it. Not much info on the item or on the box, doesn&#x27;t even say what it is for... Anyways, tried it and it irritated my skin. Not worth it for $10, so little tube! And I don&#x27;t remember seeing active ingredients on the box.</li>
    <li> It works . Have to use it regularly</li>
    <li> Worked only while I was using it. Once the tube was done the area went back to being dark.</li>
    <li> Did not WORK. waste of money, trust me don&#x27;t buy this stuff it doesnt work. It didnt work for me at all.</li>
    <li> At first it was really working.. but as I kept using it, it gave me stretch marks... It dries your skin too much so you have to keep putting lotion or something. I went camping for 3 days and forgot to bring my lotion, after a few days, I got huge stretch marks. So I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I had been looking forward to this product since it had so many good reviews. My armpits were a bit dark and I thought this product would help. After applying it for five day with no visible results I started feeling a bit sensitive under my arms. I notice I started getting red skin like stretch mark in my underarms. A day later that area of skin started peeling. I thought at first maybe it was starting to work, but because it hurt a bit I slowed my application from twice a day to once a day, but after almost two weeks I wasn&#x27;t seeing any difference and my underarms were feeling very sensitive. I stopped using it. Jump to five days later and now my arm pits are a horrible charcoal gray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was a minimal problem which might have made me shy of raising my arms when wearing a sleeveless shirt has become a humiliating problem. Now I really can&#x27;t go out without sleeves because the damage is very visible. The gel didn&#x27;t just darken what was dark already, but also made the normal  light skin around the original stain charcoal dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t know how to fix the damage this caused. Save yourself the tears and opt for a natural method to lighten, or go to a dermatologist. I fear I&#x27;m gonna have to shell out the bucks to do the latter.</li>
    <li> I received this product 3 days ago. I can&#x27;t tell yet if this gel really works or not.  I just started using it and I hope to see any progress within a week or so. I will update my review soon. For now please stand by :) oh, I give 5 star because the order came in before the date expected and smells good. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping thanks and it was a gift. The person i gave it to said it does peel your skin and she had a rash all over her neck but then it went away and for her underarms once she stopped it got darker. The shipping was pretty quick though.</li>
    <li> Peels like crazy. Don&#x27;t buy if you have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> It works somewhat well for me.</li>
    <li> Purchased for elbows. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I used one tube under my arms and it brightened drastically.. I&#x27;m going to use another just for even better results</li>
    <li> i love it just  didn&#x27;t order enough</li>
    <li> I rated this 5 stars because it worked well for me. I started to have dark armpits when I started shaving/plucking hair out since high school and got worse when I was in college. My skin gt irritated easily and would itch so much few days after. I&#x27;d scratch it and it caused scarring, darkening of my pits-with lines. I initially doubted it coz it made my underarm sensitive and started to peel..but I didn&#x27;t want to lose hope, I decided to finish the whole tube and what I just did was to use it to once a day only to once every other day and I noticed exciting results. I didn&#x27;t peel anymore and the skin got brighter. Especially after I got my desired result, I just used it about 3x a week. I let it dry and then put my deodorant. After the 1st tube, I&#x27;m really satisfied with my underarms. :) but I did still purchased another tube for maintenance. I&#x27;m worried to have dark pits again since I still pluck/shave hair. It&#x27;s more than a year now, thought I&#x27;d try to make a review. I&#x27;m actually getting another tube now. :)</li>
    <li> Tried this product to clear up spots on my face and arms, it did not work after the second tube. I will not recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised this stuff really works. Used it to fade a large surgery scar and it worked! Obviously doesn&#x27;t get rid of the scar but took it from a dark brown to a normal skin color. Also fades the skin around the scar so very carefully put it ONLY where you want to lighten.</li>
    <li> I have darks spots on my face after a bout of hormonal acne and several other dark patches on the rest of my body.  This product helped to lighten these marks within a week.  I was shocked at how fast it worked given the other products I have tried took months. I went through three tubes and then finally gave up for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Each successive tube was smaller than the previous one but the price was still the same&lt;br /&gt;2. The lightening effect wears off once you stop using the product hence the reason I bought two more tubes&lt;br /&gt;3. I had conerns about the ingredients and the long term effects they would have on my body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good at what it claims to do but the results do not last</li>
    <li> Most lightening products smell bad and take too long to work for me. I started seeing results the first week! My hyper pigmentation has not completely lightened, but I can see results, which is something I haven&#x27;t been able to say so quickly.</li>
    <li> i dont no if its cuz i havent used it long enough but its been almost 3 weeks n i&#x27;ve not seen any results. i use it for my neck and inner thigh. im leaning towards that it doesnt work. idk some people here says it works but idk i guess i would keep using it. i received the item fast too so thats great!</li>
    <li> it did what it claims to do :) and further more when I use it for my under arms it does a deodorant job too :) I don&#x27;t know how and why !&lt;br /&gt;my only concern and the reason that  I did&#x27;t buy it again that there is no mention of ingredients on the packaging..&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how I used it without knowing what it contains ! But I saw a review on youtube and wanted to try it :)</li>
    <li> This product does work to an extent... it will lighten the skin a bit but not the way I personaly needed it to be. Still I like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using extreme bright for 3 weeks now and it is amazing. Many of the reviews on this product were based on people with discoloured arm pits but my issue was located on my face. I had discolouration and very dark circles under my eyes. I am a person of color and being in a climate like Arizona can really damage your skin. However I noticed results within 4 days of usage and its been working up till this day. Most lighteners would make my face break out but extreme bright does not break out your skin. It works by actually exfoliating the dead skin, revealing a brighter clearer smoother complexion. I give this product 5 stars and have ordered another 1oz tube. The price went up since my last purchase, which was the only thing I was not happy with. Overall, I recommend this product to anyone trying to reverse ANY type of discolouration of the face.</li>
    <li> Received on time product as described hope it works</li>
    <li> Really good product to get ride of scars and some dark spots because of acne. It is really strong so use it wisely.</li>
    <li> The most horrible thing I have ever used on my skin. I was using it to lighten my underarms but instead to lighten it made my armpits black with scars and burnt. I had to go to the dermatologist to get it lighten to my original colour. Please do not but this product.</li>
    <li> I have a bit of hyperpigmentation on one of my cheeks and used this religiously for months-made absolutely no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Gave the product four stars due to one dislike, it made my underarms sensitive after four months of continued use. My underarms became sensitive, but I am not sure if that was due to the use of the product and waxing. I noticed that I did not need to wear deodorant either during the four months while using the product. I also exfoliated every evening, because of the dead skin and darker skin began to flake. Do not wear white shirts white using this product! One of my shirts discolored after washing. Also, I don&#x27;t shave therefore I cannot review how the product would react on shaven skin. On waxing days I did not use the product, since my pores are open. I have also extending my weeks out on waxing as well. When I first started I would wax every 2 or 2 1/2 weeks now I only wax once a month, but I use my Emoji soft caress Epilator when the small hairs start to reappear. I would recommend this product for self-purchase, not a gift.  Knowing and understanding your skin is a key factor when using this product, because my sister had an terrible reaction to the product and I didn&#x27;t. So do your RESEARCH!!! Start off with using aluminum-free deodorant, this is a big cause of your underarm skin being dark.</li>
    <li> OMG this product cleared my spots and gave a beautiful glow, dont buy cream though.</li>
    <li> This Gel did not work for me it made my duck spot even bigger and darker💔💔😩😩</li>
    <li> would never buy this product again ! totally useless ! i spent $19. sth for this tube + $28 for shipping got ripped in olmost  50 bucks and look what i got ! NOTHING no results ! i guess peel works better than these creams.  i wasted $50 😞</li>
    <li> Its Useless!!!  don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
    <li> Chicago, IL&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping! Well packaged. Great communication. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2weeks and I already see a big difference. I will purchase another tube to be sure that I get the best results.</li>
    <li> I asm light skin and I have really dark acne scarring on my face but I have absolutely no pimple[[ASIN:B0054GBXOW Xtreme Brite Brightening Gel 1oz]]s and the thing is I wash my face with frican black soap and I was wondering if I could only apply it my acne scarring because I don&#x27;t wear male up so they are noticabe but I don&#x27;t a lotof acne scarring but I was just wondering if it will work</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve had trouble with ashy color armpits and I was always embarrass and I always tried using natural lotions but never saw a difference. I am very pleased with the results. In over a week my armpits are getting lighter! I am really happy!!!</li>
    <li> This product is about two dollars cheaper on Amazon than eBay for three tubes.&lt;br /&gt;It does work but it is not some miraculous cure.  You have to use at least 2-3 tubes before you see result since the tubes are very, very small (1oz).  Four tubes last about two months or so.  It lightens over time, not over night and it has a very pleasant scent.  I’m purchasing another 3 tubes to see if it will give further results.  After that I’ll try something else just so my skin won’t become use to it. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product was completely worthless....Lemon papaya and pure virgin olive oil have done for my skin than this product.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this for two months and noticed no difference or lightening of my skin.</li>
    <li> Turn my skink darker. Do not use this product for more than 2weeks or your skin will get darker. I didn&#x27;t even go outside</li>
    <li> This product made my face turn darker in the spot I was working on. It seemed to work at first but then this happened.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work. I can&#x27;t tell though if your skin color goes back if your stop using it. I think it does a little bit.</li>
    <li> This product worked the first month, after that I had the dark areas in my armpits again. I don&#x27;t know what to do to correct that. I know it shouldn&#x27;t matter  because I am a guy but it just doesn&#x27;t look right to have dark armpits. Although this product didn&#x27;t work for me completely,  it did made a difference.</li>
    <li> its only new so i cant tell yet, but im hoping by end of the month somehow i will even see just a little improvement</li>
    <li> I bought this product for darkening of the neck I&#x27;ve tried a few other products but nothing seemed to work. I have been using the Xtreme Brite Gel for about 11 days and in those few days I have seen a good change! Not exactly where I would like to be but by far alot better than before!! I am super happy with results and I just ordered a second tube before i run out. I just hope it keeps working as well as it has!! Hope this is good info for u all!</li>
    <li> Luvin&#x27; the results! Does what it says its going to do. Does not burn and it&#x27;s slowly lightening my skin</li>
    <li> This product definitely works for me... I have dark underarms and i&#x27;m asian... but after using this (I&#x27;m on my second one)... i can tell the big difference. I&#x27;m using it on my face too.. and my face has brightened and the skin tone evened out.</li>
    <li> This item I bought and I regularly used it to see if it works. It was very disappointing! The item does not whiten. It has false advertisements. Please do not get suck in to this item!</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been dealing with hyperpigmentation on my neck since before high school, i&#x27;m dark skinned black woman.  NOTHING worked and certainly not quite like this and without ANY irritation. (No hydroquoine I guess)I&#x27;ve tried amby skin tone,palmers, sus wexler,bio oil and plain old rubbing alcohol-these products are dead in comparison. I have VERY sensitive skin and I no problems with this products.  In ONE (1) UNO week I noticed a dramatic transformation-WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!! did I say WOW!!!!!!!!!!! now I know how those women feel on those infomercials that cry because something FINALLY WORKED for them- now I understand *tear*  I ordered one tube to test it out- based on previous reviews, I had to give it try.  So here I am ordering the 3-pack this will surely do the trick and complete my transformation!!!! thanks Frenchies (product made in France) LOL  SINCERELY  Mrs B</li>
    <li> so i&#x27;ve used multiple products to help me get rid of dark armpits. this actually worked. I think it&#x27;s a combination of waxing/tweezing them and this gel. It does not burn at all- which at first made me believe it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried this on my knees and elbows and it hasn&#x27;t really changed yet so i&#x27;m worried it only works for those parts that you wax/tweeze.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Blackheads came right off after within days of using product and skin lightened up. Too bad the price shot up quiet significantly. On to another product I found.</li>
    <li> I see a slight change but nothing big I will continue using it for now almost done with the tube</li>
    <li> I am an African American female who used this product to help with dark skin pigmentation.  It really didnt help at all.  I would not recommend buying the product</li>
    <li> Please stay far away from this gel. This gel can work and give you a nice glow for a short period of time but what will befall you after that will require you seeing a skin doctor. My armpit and all around my neck / chest was broken out in big round painful bumps that now has left very bad scrars. I&#x27;m very ashamed to wear anything that will expose my armpit or chest. Due to what this gel did to my skin it looked like i had skin disease. They need to discontinue this gel asap.</li>
    <li> it takes time to see results but it does work. I only use it on my armpit and my knee and elbows</li>
    <li> I never had bad skin to begin with. With the exception of the monthly period pimple, I rarely break out but one pimple a month leaves a dark mark on my face for 3-4 months after. I got thus gel because I wanted to lighten the dark marks from the pimples long gone and some discoloration around my nose attributed to my glasses.  I started to use this gel on my entire face and neck for two whole weeks now (twice a day) and I can honestly see that my dark marks have lightened to where they are either gone completely or barely noticeable. Plus my skin is smoother and glowing. I love how it looks now. My skin was good before but, now it is great. I use it twice a day and always make sure to apply sunscreen during the day time. I have been using it in conjunction with kojie san soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 month update: so I used this product consistently twice a day on my entire face and neck. I went through 2.5 tubes. I was trying to even out my skin tone. My neck and face have always been 2-3 shades darker than the rest of my body. The results for the first two months were absolutely gorgeous. The gel made my skin super smooth by shrinking my pores, evening my tone, and brightening my complexion with golden undertones. My skin was flawless like a child&#x27;s and I didn&#x27;t have to wear a stitch of makeup. I was truly happy with the results and was diligent to apply high SPF sunscreen daily to protect my results. I never got so many unwarranted compliments by strangers on my beauty ever before and it felt like a dream. I was determined to keep up the regime with the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to November, two weeks ago, I noticed my skin randomly peeling in the shower. During the past week and half I watched my skin go from a beautiful, gorgeous even-toned glow to substantially darkened, burned, and patchy.&lt;br /&gt;After my glow suddenly vanished and I was left with large dark areas on my cheeks, around my mouth, and around my nose.  The dark areas were even darker than my original tone.However, my nose, my forehead, and neck remained light. The disparity between the two tones was horrendous. I had to plaster makeup on just look normal enough to go out. I don&#x27;t feel beautiful anymore. I don&#x27;t know why this happened since I was so careful to apply and reapply sunscreen everyday and avoid the sun as much as possible. The company claims this gel does not have hydroquinone. I don&#x27;t believe it now. There are some types of harsh chemicals in this gel that the company is not reporting on the ingredients list. I stopped applying the gel and my skin has been gradually returning to its original color. I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural skin brightener option for future use, because I am afraid this gel will destroy my skin with long-term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My warning to anyone thinking about buying this gel: Though it definitely works in the short-term with diligent application, you will possibly run into ugly results using it longer than 2 months. Be very careful. I strongly suggest finding a natural option for skin brightening.</li>
    <li> This works great u wish I can upload my progress picture</li>
    <li> i did not see change from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;i was expecting some changes from positive review but i guess it doesn&#x27;t really work on me</li>
    <li> Did not work  for me. At least the first tube didn&#x27;t. Maybe I was supposed to keep using it, but I used the first tube daily and saw no results.</li>
    <li> Listen ladies please do not buy this product it is terrible and it made my armpits worst and it&#x27;s been 4 months since I discontinued this product thankfully I did develop stretch marks like others have but my skin is slowly going back to normal their still dark but better than when I was using this product ugh epic fail</li>
    <li> Service: Ordered from the UK. It wast a fast delivery and well packaged &#x3D; Will purchase from here again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: Like most people have mentioned, it is a good product. I am currently on my second tube and can see slight progress although it will probably take another tube to lighten completely. Verdict &#x3D; Works but takes time (weeks if not months).</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use it enough to see if it works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 5-stars because from purchase to shipping the process was quick and painless. The product arrived intact with great instructions on how to apply topical cream to sensitive body parts.</li>
    <li> this product is awesome. if you use it every day it will work. i had some dark spots on my forehead from the sun that even with makeup i could not hide. this product did the trick. i used it every day at bedtime after washing my face and after a few weeks i noticed the difference. i wont happen on a few days or a week so stick with it. you can even apply it twice a day for faster results, you can use it on your face, on your axcilla, between your legs or anywhere you need it. great product</li>
    <li> if you are looking for skin evening products, thsi might be an inexpensive one worth trying. it has a texture that dries strange at times, so i tend to use under a heavier lotion or balm such as egyptian magic, and before i go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;also on box/tube it claims to help with blackheads and impurites in skin. i made a point of using consistently and a lil heavy handed, and setriously, it reall does help with my skin in a few ways during the time i use it.but expect to use it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;if you are someone who loves trying new skin products, i recommend adding this one to your arsenal.</li>
    <li> THIS GETS ZERO STARS FROM ME&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this product I did my research I thought it would be safe but it wasn&#x27;t for me it my underarm skin peel horribly now I feel even worse I&#x27;m hoping it doesn&#x27;t make my underarms dark spot bigger I&#x27;m hoping and praying that everything will be ok with my skin. WONT BE BUYING AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This product is not as amazing as people make it look like. I would not buy it again &amp; I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy it!!! It didn&#x27;t work for me. Although, it may work for some since some people claim it has done wonders for them.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOD!! This stuff REALLY works!!! I am sooooooo soooo soooooo happy with this product.I saw it on YOUTUBE and had to try it. I have used it for a week (I only apply a pea-size amount in the morning and at night) and started seeing results in two days. This is the best thing ever!! It does not sting or irritate your skin, it smells wonderful, and it ACTUALLY WORKS!!! I RECOMMEND IT 100%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Looking at the ingredients list I am little worried about the safety of this gel.&lt;br /&gt;Contains Hydroquinone 1.9%&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: Water, propylene Glycol, Licorice Extract, Salicylic Acid, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Arbutus Unedo EXTRACT, Ailanthus Altissima Extract, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Titanium Dioxide, Retinyl Propionate,m Niacinamide, Glycolic Acid, Allantoin Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylparaben, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Hydroquinone which I think is not safe.  and the second ingredient in the list is propylene glycol which is shown to be linked to cancer.  and there is paraben to top it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I am tempted to using this to clear my dark underarm, I am equally scared to use it.  Does anybody have a better research into the ingredients in the gel ?</li>
    <li> This product worked up until I stopped using it. It has an ingredient that if used too much can actually burn your skin and make it even DARKER! My skin looks worse than before I used this product. I feel hopeless and helpless everyday. My insecurity has gone up and I am so depressed. I wish I never used this product. I guess you get what you pay for right? Don&#x27;t use this product if you want to lighten your hyper pigmentation or any other skin problems. It&#x27;s not worth the results. I&#x27;m going to see if a dermatologist can help fix the bigger of a mess I made to myself.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, but I felt compelled to share this with others struggling with face discoloration and the embarrasement and low self-steem associated with it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been struggling with dark spots caused by acne, and was very self conscious.  I tried a lot of other products with no relief.  This gel really works!!! Other products I tried were greasy and aggravated my acne, this gel dries with no residue!  I saw other comments about it being too harsh to use on your face, I disagree, I have sensitive skin and have had no problems- it does&#x27;nt even irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for only a week and already see a big difference- I apply it over my entire face- spots are fading, acne is under control, and pores are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I have gained so much confidence and recommend this to others struggling with similar issues.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try the cleansing soap and will update on the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for under-arm dasrk stains.  I didn&#x27;t work at all.  I need something that does work.  Someome help.</li>
    <li> With only one tube it did fade the marks on my legs. I will try something that&#x27;s stronger in results.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Doesnt work n smells.horrible</li>
    <li> It really whitens, although slowly.</li>
    <li> Um, didn&#x27;t give it enough time - just got scarier to continue to use. No REAL concerns to report.</li>
    <li> No results after a month...</li>
    <li> The gel is real strong, that&#x27;s for sure! It would peel off my skin, leaves you super sensitive to the sun, so be sure to be careful to use sunscreen or stay inside. I noticed improvement in the age spots on my arms. I put it on every day for two weeks. Ultimately, I stopped using it temporarily because of Summer outside fun beckoned me.</li>
    <li> whitens well but should not be used everyday! expands the skin too much when overused causing stretch marks. lotion must be applied! using it about every 3 days should do the trick! helps with perspiration as well!</li>
    <li> Using for 2 months. Slowly but surely the color in my underarms is balancing. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Considering all the great reviews I heard about this product I decided to try it out. I have always had issues with dark underarms so I was happy to finally get the clear underarms I have always wanted. I tried this product for about three weeks before I started noticing results,my underarms were actually getting lighter!! It wasn&#x27;t until after the third week that my underarms broke out in a terrible and painful rash. It was ugly!! and did I mention painful?...the skin on my underarms got red,swollen,with bumps all over. Beware of this product!!</li>
    <li> Amazing... I have used it for about two weeks and it works like magic. It is not all gone but it has lightened considerably. I believe that it will be all gone by the time I go thru one tube. Great to have a product that delivers what it promises.</li>
    <li> the product sounds promising.  i&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month so i can&#x27;t tell yet but im keeping my fingers crossed.  I just hope it comes with \\&quot;directions on how to use it\\&quot; and maybe a list of things of to expect.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m back for the review.  This product really does work.  I saw great results in about 3 weeks.  I mean the results were AMAZING!!!  But...just as the other reviews said, once you stop using the product the area will darken up again.  I gave this 4 stars because if you need to get ready for a special event such as a wedding, a vacation, etc, I think this product is worth it.  Also,I tried to contact the company to see if this product was safe for long term use and found that the number on the package does not belong to this company but to another skin care company.  The rep who answered the phone said they have tried to get their number removed from this packaging for a while now...so use at your own risk.  I hope this was helpful...</li>
    <li> Used this gel for about 7 days morning and night, on the seventh day I had really bad irritated and painful underarms! Bad! I am on my fifth day without using the gel and still my under arms are painful and darker!! It did nothing good for me! Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine was on Amazon &amp; called me and told me she had just seen something that might work for marks &amp; dark under arms. We both bought our Extreme Brite gel the exact same day but I did not buy my Xtreme Brite Brightening gel from Amazon I bought mine from Ebay, she bought hers from Amazon. Its been 2 weeks now and my under arms have faded drastically. Hers have gotten darker &amp; there are some red lines around the darkness. I guess she used too much??? Im not sure why that happened, but overall I love it &amp; i will definately purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars right now because I&#x27;m still testing it out. Just like many others, I saw the youtube video (several months ago &amp; I&#x27;m black as well) &amp; wanted to give it a try as soon as I got a job &amp; when I finally got a job (3 wks ago), I ordered it BUT when I ordered it I got the soap &amp; the CREME, thinking nothing of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the creme for about a week before I watched the youtube video again &amp; realized she had the GEL so then I turned around &amp; ordered the gel which I received friday 7/6/12 &amp; began using immediately twice a day &amp; at one point 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, 6 days later I&#x27;m noticing it&#x27;s starting to lighten up some which is very exciting to me. I squeeze a few dots on, normally in a diamond figure &amp; spread it with a cotton ball. I try to only shave ponce, maybe twice a week whereas normally I shave every day or every other day (it just grows back so fast &amp; I&#x27;m scared to do washing cause my pain tolerance is -5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the lightening, I noticed last night that my underarms were starting to look kinda white like I had deodorant on even though I&#x27;m using the crystal deodorant &amp; it leave 0 residue. I thought maybe I want washing off the exfoliating soap good enough but when I looked closer I noticed skin was peeling so I took a wash cloth &amp; tried to kind of rub off as much as I could which led to see the lightening. I then put on more gel which made my underarms sting a little bit which normally it doesn&#x27;t even after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idk if anyone else has had this happen, I didn&#x27;t read it in any of the reviews I read so I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal. Righty now I&#x27;m debating on whether our not to shave tonight cause my underarms do feel a little sensitive &amp;I don&#x27;t want to irritate them more but the prickly hair itself is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you&#x27;re going to try this product, but the 3pk if you can. I know people don&#x27;t wanna spend that much on something they don&#x27;t know will work, but you will finish one tubebefore you really have enough time to judge the product because they are so small. It&#x27;s only been 6 days &amp; I need to order more before I run completely out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use unless it becomes painful or I get a rash or something, either way I will update my review. Hope this helps some.</li>
    <li> i  have bought  more of them after i used one up.  but  i  spent more money this  time. thats the reason why i gave it  four stars. the price goes up  so quickly. from 9.99 to  14.99 in such a short time. i am afraid it will keep on  going up. now i  am  looking for another brand  instead of it .feel disappointed.</li>
    <li> Amazing !!! Really loved the results !!!! It works like magic !!! Will keep using it and recommend it :)</li>
    <li> This started out working really well, until I got less excited and didn&#x27;t apply it as often.  So if your going to buy it you MUST commit or your gonna be back to square one. Other than that, when used daily, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to with no side effects.</li>
    <li> This Product is effective and works well. Even with dark pigmentation, it still work. It may take 2 weeks to work and you will be amaze. Just apply regularly once a day, make sure the area is dry and wait for the result.</li>
    <li> This is a lifesaver I was always emberassed about my armpits being dark and not able to wear tank tops then I started applying this twice a day took me a week and half to see results I&#x27;m definitely going to continue to buy this!!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for the dark spots randomly around my body. Disappointing product. Its been 2 weeks and no difference. Mad!</li>
    <li> i bought this months ago and i have to share my review to people that are unsure of this product.&lt;br /&gt;its worth the buy i am latina with olive skin. ive been shaving my underarms since i was 12 i am 23 now and for a while i was embarrassed to wear tank tops because i had dark underarms. i was reading reviews and decided to give it a shot. it really works it took around 2 months to see a big difference and the one who saw it was my sis she was so shocked of the difference she bought one too.&lt;br /&gt;you have to be patient .it is gel like make sure you wash hands afterwards because it will sting your fingers  for me it has worked and im glad to know there are products out there that are affordable and worth your money.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this product but it didnt work for me instead my underarms are really irritated and itchy and red I honestly regret buying this product</li>
    <li> I AM AFRICAN AMERICAN (MEDIUM/CARAMEL COMPLEXION) BOUGHT THIS CREAM TO USE SPECIFICALLY ON AREAS OF DARKNESS ON MY FACE LEFT BY SCARS OR ACNE MARKS. SO WHAT I WOULD DO AT NIGHT IS USE A Q-TIP TO PUT IT ON THOSE AREAS AND STAY UP A WHILE TO LET IT DRY... BUT NO MATTER WHAT WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP THE CREAM WILL SPREAD TO OTHER PLACES ON YOUR FACE AND MAKE THOSE AREAS LIGHTER. THE CREAM DOES WORK BECAUSE I HAVE NOTICED SOME LIGHTENED AREAS ON MY FACE BUT I DIDN&#x27;T INTEND TO HAVE THOSE AREAS LIGHTER. I JUST WANTED TO LIGHTEN THE DARK SPOTS. I WOULD JUST PUT IT ON MY WHOLE FACE TO GET AN EVEN COMPLEXION, BUT I NOTICED THIS CREAM CAUSES ME TO BREAK OUT!!! THE AREAS THAT IT LIGHTENS CAUSES BREAKOUTS. I MEAN WHO WANTS A LIGHTER COMPLEXION WITH RED BUMPS ON YOUR FACE. OH AND I HAVE COMBINATION SKIN (OILY T-ZONE AND DRY THE REST OF MY FACE). BUT MY CHEEK AREA IS WHAT WAS BREAKING OUT WHICH I NEVER BREAK OUT THEIR ONLY ON MY FOREHEAD THAT&#x27;S HOW I KNEW IT WAS THE CREAM DOING IT. I ONLY USED THIS CREAM FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND THEN I STOPPED. YET EVERY MORNING I STILL NOTICE A FEW NEW RED PIMPLES NOT WORTH IT!!! THE LIGHTENED AREAS ARE STILL THERE AND I HAVEN&#x27;T GOTTEN DARKER AND I DON&#x27;T WEAR SUNSCREEN(I KNOW I SHOULD). ALL IN ALL THE CREAM DOES WORK, BUT TO ME IT&#x27;S NOT WORTH IT. I WONDER WHAT IT WOULD HAVE DONE TO MY FACE HAD I CONTINUED TO USE IT. WORKS DRAMATICALLY FAST BUT LONG TERM EFFECTS MAY NOT BE WORTH IT... SO USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 tubes of the Xtreme Brite Gel. i am glad to say that it definitely lightened my underarms not to the point where its perfect but i can see it slowly lightening. i am almost on my second tube and im liking the results. This product is worth a try for the price it wont give immediate results but it does its job of lightening.</li>
    <li> So I read at review in here before that this guy used this at anal to make the anal color brighter or whiter. so I try it!! and&lt;br /&gt;I works, My anal is looks fresh and looks like brand new! ^^ hahahaha LOL. I know no one would came to me to ask my anal color but This about it adults world when your having, You know... with your partner or someone from the bar. I think It great  that you feel comfortable with your body and great for your partner because looks fresh and clean. (if they ever see it)&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t felt any pain or itches  but don&#x27;t put the gel deep inside...</li>
    <li> This honestly works!!!!  You have to be patient to see results it took me six months to clear up completely, but I saw major results within the first month. For YEARS I have tried a numerous amount of bleach creams that have only made it darker. My skin did pill and it did get darker but I read in the reviews that it does that in order to see results, and I did see results!!!! Omg my husband it amazed by it and now I just buy to as a deordorant seeing that it does smell pleasant. You have to be consistent and not give up or anything like that you have to do it every day, however if you do pill within the first month take a break and just used regular oil (tea oil or coconut) to clam down the red area.  I actually used the Xtreme Brite soap as well and a exfoliater scrub in the shower with the soap 3x a day. Then I applied the Xtreme Brite Gel which you only need a pea size really. Then you can resume with the treatment. If you do peel as well  just wait off using it for awhile then restart. Take note it is trying to get rid of the darker layer of skin when it is peeling.  I did a lot of research and all of these tips helped me accomplish my goal of clear under arms. I would recommend this to any girl who has suffered the embarrassment of dark under arms.</li>
    <li> Used this for a couple weeks before I noticed a difference in my underarms. Another 2 weeks and my skin looked a lot lighter. Only reason I don&#x27;t give it another star is because I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s entirely safe for long term use.</li>
    <li> My dark spots are really fading.</li>
    <li> Love the gel and I have seen a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Has not worked at al!</li>
    <li> i liked this product but i only purchased one little tube which wasnt enough to brighten my armpits i know it would take me about 6 of this things to achieve my goal have not bought any lately because they are kind of expensive</li>
    <li> It does not work what&#x27;s so ever! It causes painful peeling of the skin and makes you darker after using. I am now at least 2 shades darker than I originally was when I started using this product two weeks ago. It did not help fade my dark spots, they are still there and very noticeable. I will buy bleaching creams instead even though they are more expensive.</li>
    <li> This product clears your skin like none other this is a must have product for me you don&#x27;t have to even use it everyday to keep skin clear it does lighten any dark marks</li>
    <li> Fast temp results. After several tubes my skin is darker than ever. Noticed lighter skin but effects did not last. My skin skin seem darker than ever before.I&#x27;m just not sure about this product. Maybe I just had a bad effect but itinitially it will help, just not sure it will last.</li>
    <li> My title for this review says it all. It does not work. I applied it 2x daily for over a month and got no change whatsoever. It was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> so far i like the smell of this product. and i just started to use it. so i&#x27;ll write more later on how the product works.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days, n I saw a little difference already,. On the 3rd day of using it, I applied it countless times and as I did that it got lighter. I forgot to mention I have really bad acne scars that were dark compared to my natural skin tone., it really lightens with one application, I noticed when I put the extra gel on my hands on my chest!. The thing I don&#x27;t like is that only some areas on my face were lighter, you just gotta target those areas , you&#x27;ll figure out what to do., but for the most part its ok so far,. I can&#x27;t wait to see my final results!.(&#x3D;</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and was confident enough to buy a couple of tubes to try it for myself. I would like to specify that I am a male.. yes MALE. I read other comments and have to say that the majority of them were from women. For those of you not sure why I ordered it, - let&#x27;s be adults here - was to bleach my anus (a common cosmetic practice nowadays, mind you) and to lighten a birthmark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great product this is! I have used the cream for a little over a week and must say I have seen a considerable amount of difference. I&#x27;m not embarrassed at all to say this, in fact, I&#x27;m quite sure there are many others curious and/or interested in doing this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for those of you that say it burns in certain areas, (most of you have specified underneath your arms) I will say.. for \\&quot;opened pores\\&quot;, yes, it can. Just be MINDFUL of that. For those of you interested in bleaching your anus, it worked GREAT for me. Just make sure it doesn&#x27;t go any deeper \\&quot;in there\\&quot; as it did have a small burning sensation when I wasn&#x27;t careful. I have no rashes, irritations, scars, marks, etc. from this product. None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel has a pleasurable odor, and actually has softened the skin where it has been applied. Wow. Definately a great product for a very inexpensive price. Just can&#x27;t beat that. I will continue to buy it and HIGHLY recommend it too :D</li>
    <li> Xtreme bright brightening gel really works. It&#x27;s been 1 week now I&#x27;m using it and I can see it lightens my underarm. First I was worried coz there&#x27;s a dark streak in my underarm after 3 days I used it but I realized I used a lot of amount of the gel. So I used a small Amt only the next I used it. But early this morning the dark streak in my underarms were expoliated that&#x27;s why I was amazed... I used 5 stars right now after my last review since 3 weeks ago.  I&#x27;m not ashame to show my armpit.</li>
    <li> i tried to use it on my scars... showed no effect. i dont recomend this product and it is the worst i ever used.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first tube and it worked alittle. ordering the second one so lets see how it goes.I need my dark spots totally clean so i can put on shorts.</li>
    <li> I wanted a product to lighten my dark underarms which occurred due to years of using deodorant with aluminum.  I purchased Xtreme Brite after seeing several testimonials online.  After only four days of use, the product actually made my underarms darker.  What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> This brightening gel does absolutely nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I am a 35 year old carmel colored African American woman and I have been using this product for just over a year and it has changed my life. I have seen better results with this than ANYTHING else I have ever used before. I have struggled wIth acne and acne scars on and off since I was about 13 years old. I have shared this with at least 5 other family members and friends and it has done the same for them! You begin noticing a smoothness in your skin within about 3 to 5 days. It will be subtle so don&#x27;t get your hopes WAY up at the beginning. Then after a few weeks your old skin starts to peel away slowly. As you continue to use it your skins begins to go through peel (the dead kinds begins to LITERALLY peel away in the worst areas) and heal (where it looks beautiful just after peeling) cycles. It will shed roughly every 2 to 3 weeks if you use it DAILY over several MONTHS. My skin went through the peel and heal process for about 6 months before it stopped peeling. I am assuming because all the dead damaged layers were finally gone. After the 6 months, it was like I had a new face (even small wrinkles faded away)!!! I admit I am addicted and cannot stop using this product. Anytime I get a breakout or have a scar I use it immediately and the bump is gone within 1 to 3 days, depending on how deep or large. And the scar (if any) is gone within a week because it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to get really dark or deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also really like about the BRIGHTENING GEL is that it dries on your skin within a minute and practically disappears with no greasy residue - especially when you put it on within seconds after washing and drying your face. It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores like the Xtreme Brite Cream or the Xtreme Brite Acne Spots Remover (which I don&#x27;t really recommend, strangely) AND other oily/greasy products like Retin A, hydroquinone or even some other skin products I have used from dermatologists in my past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final thing, I have found that using Acne Free facial wash (the basic orange and white bottle) morning and night along with this product MORNING AND NIGHT somehow seems to keep the acne under control and enhance the results of the Xtreme Brite Gel.</li>
    <li> Waste of money as most over-the-counter bleaching items are</li>
    <li> I am from Puerto Rico but my mother is mixed with African American. So my skin can get discoloration. I started noticing darkness under my arm and my armpits were almost black. It was so embarrassing I couldn&#x27;t take any pictures without making sure my arms were down. I started using this product and after 3 weeks I discovered my underarms begin to look a lot better. I think we it som etime you will begin to see the result that you want but everyone is different. This product works for me and I will continue to use it I&#x27;m too I get the results that I want. I also have dark spots on my face and have began to see results;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;03/02/13 ...I have to warn to be careful using a lot of it...make sure its thin because it can burn it and darken the area.</li>
    <li> I used this product a couple years ago.  It worked really well.  It was the first product that worked to clear up my skin.  However, after a couple months, it went off the market.  When it did come back, I tried it again and it did not work.  I&#x27;m convinced that the formula was changed...</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I began using it four days ago and even for a man I am amazed at the glow on my face. There was a few dark spots from shaving over the years now there is an awesome balanced even skin tone. Even for men, you can trust this products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried two other products and they do not match up to the results of this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work at all, not good don&#x27;t waste time and money and this,  please do better next time. Lord lord</li>
    <li> I have to be honest. I really didn&#x27;t think this product was worth it. I knew I wouldn&#x27;t see results in one day but I definitely didn&#x27;t expect to see results after two! I&#x27;m an dark-skinned African American and after applying this to the hyperpigmented marks on my face, I can definitely see a difference. In fact, I think I may even have to be careful because the spots are already starting to lighten a bit too much. But overall folks this really does work. Best part of all no breakouts and no horrible burning sensation and this is coming from someone with extremely sensitive skin and eczema lol.</li>
    <li> I have used many products over the years for acne caused hyperpigmentation. I have not have much success. I heard about this product on Youtube and decided to give it a try.  I have been using it for the past few weeks, and it has out performed any other brightening/lightening products that&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried prescription based hydroquinone solutions as well as expensive products such as Lytera. None have worked as quickly as Xtreme Brite.  It also helped to clear a recent breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience some peeling, but it wasn&#x27;t bad. I use a gentle exfoliant and good moisturizer to help with that.</li>
    <li> This works just like it said it would. I love it. No burning or anything. Its perfect for what I need!</li>
    <li> At first this product worked on me, I was really glad and happy. But after using it for 2-3 week, I noticed that my underarm has gotten really dark and itchy..even on the side of my underarm..it made it worst!!! Any recommendations on what to get next?</li>
    <li> Works on lighter/newer discolorations. I make sure to use sunscreen of 30 or better now. Protecting skin from sun damage.</li>
    <li> Excelent product within two weeks I started seeing a difference love it!! I order some moré to start and put itin other parts</li>
    <li> This product works, growing up in the Caribbean i always would kneel and wipe the floors, so my knees got dark, and being light skin it shows, i began using this product and i have seen great results. i will continue to used it. will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this on here and didn&#x27;t notice any change at all!!!! just got a lil darker in my underarms I was extremely disappointed! I did by another kind of skin whitener and I&#x27;m noticing results in the first week. Dr Fred summit at Walmart.. That one is really working(:</li>
    <li> I got the xtreme brite gel in the mail and immediately put it on the same day. I have had underarms darkness ever since I can remember and even though they are still dark I am beginning to notice the difference!!! I use the gel twice a day, once after I shower and another time before going to bed, I find that it is not necessary to use any deodorant with this product and I usually cant go on without using any. However, it really keeps it dry and smelling great because it has a good smell to it. I hope to have achieved the optimal results in a few more weeks but I am already very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on a small dark spot on my skin and saw no change. I&#x27;ve had no irritations; but no results either.</li>
    <li> the price was to high for such a small bottle. not worth the money. product did work thou. . .</li>
    <li> I really wanted to say it worked greatly... I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple days and I have not seen any differences. There was also no instructions with the product... So that did not help. How long am I supposed to be using this for?</li>
    <li> Just recently started using this on my underarms. I started noticing a difference not too long after. Seems like something I will have to buy again to get the results I desire, but that&#x27;s ok with me!</li>
    <li> Would def recommend Xtreme Brite Brightening Gel. Has worked very well for me. Definitely will order this product again soon.</li>
    <li> THis cream is just useless...I meannnnn deff useless...dont waste your time and money. I applied it many times for many days , it had no effect at all on the skin.</li>
    <li> Ive been using the product for about 3 days along with the exfoliating soap and I can already see a difference.</li>
    <li> It did work..&lt;br /&gt;It felt cool at first on my skin, like an aloe vera gel...or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a bit sensitive but boy did I not know.&lt;br /&gt;I saw it getting lighter so I kept using it. But then my skin started patching up so I thought it was part of the peeling process.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my underarms and pretty soon, I got the worse rash, inflamed skin I wanted to cry. I couldn&#x27;t even lift my arms and wore loose tops so it wouldn&#x27;t touch my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am scared of this product. Maybe for someone else. But if you even have remotely sensitive or dry skin, DON&#x27;T USE THIS!</li>
    <li> stopped using it because it actually turned red not white and it kinda looked like it melted my skin..I guess it&#x27;s not for me</li>
    <li> At first I was a little spectacle about this cream, but after trying it I saw a bit of a difference. I didn&#x27;t see much discoloration but enough that could be noticeable</li>
    <li> I HAVE ADDISON DISEASE FROM A LOT OF CORTISONE... I HAVE SO MANY DARK BLOTHES, I&#x27;VE TRIED EVERYTHING, EVEN SINK SCRUB, BUT FINALLY I FOUND XTREME BRIGHTENING GEL AND AFTER 3 WEEKS MY SKIN IS VERY NOTICEABLY BETTER.  I AM THRILLED!!  THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> IT TAKES A FEW USES, BUT SO FAR I HAVE YET SEE FULL REMOVAL OF BLOTCHES BUT IT DOES MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE, GET IT.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for my underarms like most review but i used it on my arms, elbows, knees and legs....i would apply one layer of it morning and night and i did this for about two months and I didn&#x27;t see any results. as a matter of fact my leg experienced some discoloration....i got scared and stopped using it. I can&#x27;t say that it was due to this product but it&#x27;s the only thing i have been using for the past two months. It really didn&#x27;t do much for me...</li>
    <li> Great product but size is small but does work !</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to work because it does indeed lighten. I was putting a gob on a scar from acne picking and over night it would be almost white. But if I got too much sun exposure that day or after, it would turn darker!!!! Not what I signed up for.</li>
    <li> ok product gave minor results</li>
    <li> in two weeks my under arms where white..my under arms where like almost black n nasty looking in just two weeks my under arms got clear where i dont have to be a shame of it any more is very cheap i highly recomend it trust me just give it a shot.</li>
    <li> great product immediate results.. thumbs up!! using on face. feels great and I am impressed with results.. just a week of use!</li>
    <li> i have not seen any results yet but ithink its going to worik  because they are lighter already so i have a good feeling!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure why the reviews aren&#x27;t better...I was skeptical about how effective it would be and worried that it might irritate my skin. But I slowly and incrementally started using this on my face and now I put it all over my face and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed lightening effects. Maybe because my skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive and is darker (lighter skin tends to be more sensitive). I hope it doesn&#x27;t end up having bad effects later but it&#x27;s working amazingly for now.  Not to mention, the gel is an amazing consistency! It&#x27;s lightweight because it&#x27;s a gel but also moisturizing! Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and you can wear it under makeup with no problems!</li>
    <li> Hesitated but it seem to work!!</li>
    <li> no noticeable effects</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle no difference,</li>
    <li> This product is great! I would defenitely recommend  it. Just after a week of applying it you can see a great difference. I passed through tons of products that didn&#x27;t work until I got to this on. Now I have flawless underarms.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I am African American and I have dark circles under my eyes, dark arm pits, elbows, and knees. I have only been using this gel for 3 weeks and the dark circles are gone!! I am amazed and I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror. I have never known my face without the dark circles.  I am also using it on the other areas mentioned and even though the improvement is slower than it was on my face there is significant improvement. The skin on your face is considerably thinner so it is important to expect that it will work faster on the facial skin.  If you are struggling with dark patches that you want to lighten I urge you to use this gel twice a day everyday and you will be in love with the results.  :)</li>
    <li> I never ever thought I&#x27;d find a solution to my dark underarms. I&#x27;ve had them since I hit puberty and have tried different methods throughout the years, but they were all too difficult to maintain and didn&#x27;t really seem to work. I happened to google the underarm discoloration topic again just to see if someone had come up with a solution for this issue and I ran into this. I got my first tube, applied it once a day, and after a couple of weeks (about a month or so) I have DEFINITELY noticed improvement. There is still a little darkness but I haven&#x27;t finished my first tube yet, so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll even out pretty soon. I&#x27;ve already ordered three more tubes for maintaining an even color and I may even use it elsewhere. I have noticed a little redness, but it&#x27;s not enough to make it an issue and I don&#x27;t feel any discomfort at all. I guess if you have more sensitive skin, be wary, since I&#x27;ve read that some people had bad reactions to this product. If you have the means to buy this product and you&#x27;ve suffered through other methods of trying to even out your skin color, BUY THIS. I can confidently say that I&#x27;m going to be wearing some sleeveless tops this summer.</li>
    <li> Most reviewers here seem to be dark complexioned and generally have touted this cream to be nothing short of a miracle in a tube. I&#x27;m happy it works for them! My underarm darkness is due to dryness / usage of deo sticks. I lasered my body 5 years back and have very little if any, underarm hair. Therefore I only shave rarely say once a month. I&#x27;ve slathered on all sorts of creams, including Amlactin, Urea, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it but neither the dryness nor the ashy discoloration leave my pits. Using deodorant antiperspirant generally exacerbates this shadow and the alcohol in the deos dry me out even more, hence I switched to a milder baking soda deodorant ever since I started using this gel. However I saw no results using this gel. Zilch. Nada. Nothing at all. The area hasn&#x27;t lightened up even one or two shades after going through 2 tubes of this gel. Like everyone I too saw the Youtube video for this product and caved in (does that girl work for this company? lol!!) Desperate for clear skin, I purchased a 3 pack gel even before trying it out. My bad! It has been exactly 5 weeks today. I did use it liberally 2-3 times a day but there&#x27;s no effect on my skin at all, not even on my acne marks :( Looks like another $45 down the drain. :( I won&#x27;t be buying again since it didn&#x27;t work for me. If it helps anyone, I have a pale skin tone (like Alabaster/Light Beige).</li>
    <li> This was sort of an impulse buy as I stumbled upon this product while I was shopping for another skin treatment on amazon.com.  I noticed the rave reviews that it has received and I felt compelled to try it. Although prior to starting xtreme gel, the discoloration of my underarms had already improved after discontinuing the use of anti-perspirant for a couple of years now, I still figured my underarms could use some lightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also curious to see how my facial complexion could benefit from the brightening gel.  I am of hispanic descent so I tend to tan very easily and over the years have developed some freckles on and around my nose and I rather prefer the appearance of my natural skin tone, I have also struggled with dark under eye circles.  The improvements that were instantly notable are; the overall tone of my complexion including my under-eye circles and surprisingly the surface of my facial skin has become smoother (almost porcelain like) as the appearance of pores has all but disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW the gel has a nice scent and a very soothing texture when applied to the skin. I have experienced no irritation.  Perhaps a bit of dryness after about 1 week of use, but for me no irritation at all.  I don&#x27;t tend to have sensitive skin so this wasn&#x27;t much of a concern for me to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to my face, for the past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve also been applying the xtreme gel to my underarms, and some dark spots from previous scrapes along my legs, knees and ankles which I have developed from several years of rock climbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there has been improvement of my under arm skin tone, the results are less dramatic compared to my face, but given the results so far I do expect greater improvement with continued use over the next several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of the scars and scrapes on and around my legs has begun to fade from a brownish tone to a lighter pinkish tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my results after 2.5 weeks of use.  Given the results I&#x27;ve experienced up this point I HIGHLY recommend xtreme brightening gel to anyone looking to improve their complexion and any bodily discoloration.  I hope this review was helpful!</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money. Im a black but very light person. My skin is light brown but, I have dark spots that I wanted to lighten and all it did was darken my skin. Now my inner thighs are darker from the use of this. Save your money. It work for the first week but one you keep going the more you waste your money.</li>
    <li> scam ... don&#x27;t buy !!!</li>
    <li> I got this product on march 1st 2013. I used it the same night, I exfoliated &amp; cleaned my armpits well before I applied it. I was skeptical at first like most users, years of having dark &amp; ugly underarms, I tried almost everything &amp; anything! Lemon &amp; sugar scrub, natural ingredients, bleaching products, lotions &amp; nothing! Etc.etc. I was hopeless but I saw this product on YouTube &amp; really wanted to try it, I honestly did not expect to see results in one day! But I did, I kept checking my armpits every hour just to see if I saw a difference &amp; I did. This product is surely working for me. I feel sexier already! I will continue using it twice daily &amp; exfoliating my armpits. I will right another review in a few more months.. I&#x27;m loving it right now!</li>
    <li> Skin pealed horribly!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past two years recently I have bought it from different sellers and it looks like 2 different products.I have received the  gel in a clear gel and one with a yellowish tint I&#x27;m confused I can&#x27;t tell which one is better or the real thing are there fakes out there? When I first started using the gel it was the clear one which i saw good results so i started buying them 3 to 5 tubes at a time. When i received the one with the yellowish tint i could tell that the smell was slightly different and it didn&#x27;t work as well ( I use them on my hands mainly ) which was working until i got the yellowish gel. I now don&#x27;t want to order anymore until i find out what&#x27;s going on with the product since the prices can vary from 25.00 up to 75.00 and even more. I would of given it a much better review in the past but for now i need to call the company to see what&#x27;s going on .I could of just had an old batch or some FAKES!</li>
    <li> It is working for me I like it</li>
    <li> I used and liked the soap, but the gel didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I was desperate when I started googling dark armpits. This condition has made me self conscious my whole life. I kept my arms down as much as possible. I am a darker tone African-American woman but these patches on my armpits were completely BLACK. Now one is completely clear and the worst one is almost there after using a pea sized amount morning and night for about 4 weeks at first now just mornings. It&#x27;s been about 8 weeks. I still can&#x27;t believe it. I am so sorry for those who had bad experiences, but mine were so bad I felt it couldn&#x27;t get any worse. Good luck guys!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I say if it darkens, stop using and just use a milder fade cream to get back to where you were but just try it! It&#x27;s a game changer!</li>
    <li> Plssss It really works!!!! I had vowed never to change my gel for another because it lightens but after the reviews I thought you know what, its no harm giving this a trial, I did and it changed my mind over my former gel that I have using for years. The good thing about this is, its even cheaper than what i have been using, it smells soo good, is clear, and yet very powerful. I had this dark spot on my elbow for years, my former gel cream didn&#x27;t clear it and just after few days of applying this wonderful Godsent gel, my spot are beginning to fade away. I am gonna order more, I really wish they make it in a bigger tube though but for as long as it works, no worries for me. I will order 3 or 4 today. This is just amazing, too good to be true!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Misleading title \\&quot;Extreme Bright\\&quot;.  This product does not really lighten as it promises.  It helps make the skin feel very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lightens skin...it does not.</li>
    <li> This product WORKS!!!. I am a dark skinned Black girl and I have had dark armpits ALL my life from shaving. As in the other reviews I was very self conscious about raising my arms with sleeveless clothing. I did some research and the first thing I started to do was NOT SHAVE OFTEN. Shaving was really damaging my skin. I deployed so I&#x27;m not wearing sleeveless tops right now so it was easy to do that. Then I would exfoliate my underarms with the Xtreme Bright Exfoliating soap (which smells great!) and then dry my underarms and rub the gel in. After about 6-8 weeks my underarms were SO LIGHT! I still don&#x27;t shave as often but when I get out of deployment I&#x27;m going to wax instead of shave to see how that works. This product  is excellent and I would reccomend it to ANYONE!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It makes your skin look bright and clear. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it, and it really works. It started clearing my skin up in 2 days. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work out for me used it 2 times a day and still have marks on face and areas where used. Every one skin is different.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for the skin to brighten and kinda smells like old lady perfume or lotion wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> This product is so horrible I used it 2 times a day , at first I started to see a little change , them it made my skin soooo dry , it looked like 80 years old skin !!</li>
    <li> Pls dont purchase this, your skin will regret it. Its like putting glue on your body and have those fake white skin coming out only in this case, its your real skin looking like you have chicken pox!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product really works. But I&#x27;m not yet sure it works best for me. People said to wait around two months to see the result, so I&#x27;ll wait and see. I am kind of sceptical ... but it does work for your armpits and dark places. so i m gonna give it  about two more months</li>
    <li> I used it everyday after the shower and doesnt fade the skin.  I finished all the tube completely with no results.</li>
    <li> This prodcut has blown me away it actually works!!!! I would recommend to not shave; wax  instead and dont scrub to hard because you will irrate the skin and use the exfoliating soap and you will see results in no time. I finally found a product that gives what it promises.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product . I am super excited to use it but I can&#x27;t find directions on the box or the tube itself . It just says to \\&quot; use regularly with other products of the XTREME BRITE brand .\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Called the company via their toll free number but no one picked up and their voice mail box number was full .&lt;br /&gt;Little afraid to apply it because I fear that if I leave it on for too long it may burn my skin . I will be updating this review later after I finally get a recommended application time .</li>
    <li> It made my skin peel, bleed a little, burn like a bitch, and made my underarms darker.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I saw results in just two weeks I used it twice a day for the dark circles under my eyes and some dark patchy areas around my mouth.. the product is really strong so it might cause some minor pealing nothing too serious though at least it was for me. My skin is even and flawless i don&#x27;t need foundation or concealer this was a God send I would recommend this product to a friend! Good Luck Ladies :)</li>
    <li> Smells odd and did nothing at all for me.I used it on my sunburnt feet,maybe its only for facial use,i dont know,but it was a waste of money.I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> i am the type of person that never writes reviews, this is literally my first review ever and i CAN  TRULY SAY THAT THIS STUFF WOOOOOORKKSSS amazing price and amazing results!!!! buy it now!! i used for my undearms and it was amazing</li>
    <li> Idk what everyone on here is talking about but this product doesnt work at all, nothing changed there wasnt a difference in my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Hispanic female that has always had troubles with dark armpits. I have been using the gel for about a month now and my armpits are sooooo much lighter !! I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing and I will continue to use the gel for maybe another month and that should do the trick :)) deff recommend it to anyone who has tried other products and had no results. I wasn&#x27;t too sure that this one would work but I took my chances and ended up being great for me. Only thing is it has been making my underarms a little itchy here and now but nothing I can&#x27;t handle.</li>
    <li> I give this item 5 stars because it did what it said it would and i saw results within a week. I&#x27;m using the product for my underarms and they have already lighten about 2 shades within about 3weeks! I will continue to purchase until i get my underarms to the desired shade.</li>
    <li> This gel smells wonderful! It also brightens your skin leaving it feeling soft. I have used this product for 2 months and love it! Will definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 boxes of this product with high hopes.  Wanted to lighten knee area and burn scar on stomach.  Unfortunately, this was a bust.  I don&#x27;t understand all these reviews.  I still have some left, so I&#x27;ll try again and keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on customers review, unfortunally i did not see any results yet. i use it twice a day, i don&#x27;t like the smell, my skin feels very sentitive now, and it&#x27;s been about a month very unhappy with my results so far. Would not recommend this product for persons like me who are willing to get the skin bright for summer time.</li>
    <li> I am a 22 year old asian female with light tan skin but my underarms are very dark. I read a lot of good reviews about this product so I thought I would try it out. When I first started using the product, it worked a little bit and took about two shades off. After my skin was two shades lighter, I continued using the product because I thought that I would continue to see results. After using if for about six weeks it didn&#x27;t get any lighter than those two shades, but something terrible happened so I had to stop using it. I formed two dark red indented lines on my armpits that look like stretchmarks and they are very noticeable. I would post pictures, but it&#x27;s very embarassing. I rated this a 2 out of 5 because it did take off two shades off my armpits... but now I have these dark red indents on my armpits. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, and I would never buy it as a gift.</li>
    <li> At the beginning I got a little discouraged because my eyelid scars turn darker, but as I continued to use it, I notice that this gel really works, just be consistent the first week and you will be amazed.  You do not have to wait forever to see result, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. After only a week my skin turned red and started peeling; I immediately stopped using this product since. After i stopped using the product my skin healed and left blotchy marks where I had applied it.&lt;br /&gt; I wanted to believe the Higher rated reviews but sadly its crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their website is a bit off if you read some of what they say about their company they exaggerate a lot. Their website uses stock photos, and cheap music to elude the fact they are selling a sketchy product. Their real HQ is a rundown shack on the shady side of town if you do some digging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the time and money; this product is not worth it.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. I haven&#x27;t really been able to use it much. It seems to work okay. Is what it says it is.</li>
    <li> Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy it.I have suffered for one whole year after using it. After using it for 2 weeks i noticed no difference in my skin tone(i am brown but more on the fairer side) Infact after two weeks i noticed tiny pimples appearing on my forehead.I discontinued the use but then i started seeing appearance of medium sized pimples all over my face.Long story short it was the most horrible skin reaction i have ever had. Finally after going to 5-7 dermatologists in the last year i was able to get rid of pimples and acne altogether but my skin is scared!!!!!! still dealing with the marks!&lt;br /&gt;One of the worst decisions of my life was to purchase this crapy product!!</li>
    <li> I bought both the gel  and exfoliating soap and started using it right away twice a day. I didn&#x27;t use any deodorant or shaved. After the third day my armpits became extremely irritated, red and itchy. I stopped using the product, but even a few days after I still had redness and was suffering from severe itchiness. I will be returning this product. Don&#x27;t buy products with harsh chemicals that can have an adverse reaction on your skin.  Consult a dermatologist or esthetician before treating dark skin. I learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> Im a woman of color it works great for me the key to better results is applying more product more often in my experience. I used it for dark circles under my eyes, blemishes,and my dark armpits they took about a week to show results and they were gone in about three weeks. After that I used them for my knees and elbows (this was my second tube) and I occasionally(once every couple of months) put it under my eyes to prevent them from going dark again. I havent had to use it for my armpits since Ive lightened them and that was almost a year ago my knees are a nice complexion along with the rest of my skin, this product has been the only product that evened my complexion and I got the results that I wanted so this is something I am keeping in my beauty collection.&lt;br /&gt;Now if you try to use this product to lighten your complexion then good luck with that it doesnt work like that it only evens out to your complexion when I lightened my armpits they were pink and a little blotchy but they evened out back to my natural skin color after a week so i suggest you not use it to be lightskinned unless you want to look like a spotted pink freak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;July 26 I previously gave this product 5 stars and loved it but :(&lt;br /&gt; Im convinced the formula has been changed I have been using it for over a month (since June 20)and my skin peels but doesnt get much lighter infact Ive noticed the area where I applied the gel is now darker than it was before.  I am not happy at all because I used this product for a whole year (last year) and the previous tubes Ive had, worked wonders. Now I look like a raccoon with flakes on my face I look hideous like I have a disease thank god I dont need it for my armpits because I&#x27;d be pissed if they got black too.  Also the product used to not take this long to work it used to peel after a week or two and even out by the third week now I dont know what is happening and I dont like it. I do not see myself purchasing this product ever again if anyone can recommend a product that has CONSISTANT results it would be very much appreciated.</li>
    <li> The product has lightened my underarm area slightly but has also caused a little redness that I did not have before.  I saw many testimony videos about this product and will still keep trying being that some people used it for 3 months.  I have used it for 1 month with some results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working well for me, I can tell the difference been using it for two weeks, so happy with the results. Still using it</li>
    <li> This product was alright , although it turned my skin a little yellow .</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, hope for good results, thank you for sending the item in such a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I used this product under my arms where I have dark patches. I combined the use of this cream with non-aluminum deodorant and found that within a month my arms were normal.&lt;br /&gt;I used the cream once a day usually before bed. I also lose some weight during this time and felt that the 3 combined really helps with eliminating dark spots on the body.&lt;br /&gt;Summer has caused my neck to become a bit darker than I like.  I will be returning to the product once I find the best online prices.</li>
    <li> Been using it for over a month. Twice a day on my elbow and I barely notice a difference. Buy something else.</li>
    <li> I had gotten some good results with xtreme brite. So ladies try it. I promise you will get rid of that embaressing dark under arms. This is the #1 product i have use to get what i wanted. Now i can wear the clothes i want.</li>
    <li> My skin is fair and smooth. I have a few skin blotches on my face and a few on my arms. I foliated very well to remove any access dead skin cells, for Xtrene bright to work best. I did this everyday for 30 days just to give this produce it&#x27;s best chance to work with a fair opinion. I can absolutly say FOR ME only, that Xtreme Brite Brightening Gel, does not work at all. This was a waste of $14.00 You are better off going to Walgreens buying Porcelana or Ultra-Glo. My hat&#x27;s off to anyone this gel worked for you. I will never buy this produce again, nor will I recommend it to anyone. So keep your money and find something better. A good thing to use is diluted lemon juice, wait a half hour, then wash your skin. This seems to brighten the skin naturally. Also, Amazon did a fantastic job sending this product to me very quickly to my surprise, I just disappointed that it did not work.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I used the entire tube to clear up dark spots on my face and legs.</li>
    <li> It seems to work quickly and dramatically, but very unevenly.  My skin was far blotchier and more irritated than before, even if some spots were visibly lighter.  Also, it smells as though it is made of strong chemicals and burned my nose.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly, really helps lighten up the skin wherever you have darkened skin or blotches.  Use it in conjunction with a whitening deodorant, works perfect together.  Helped clear up some darkened scars under my armpits.  Has a nice aroma, gentle on skin, not greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I began to notice a HUGE difference in the color of my underarm. For years of having an even skin tone under my arms. I was horrified at how dark and thick the skin had become. So I did a little research and discovered this WONDERFUL product. I saw a HUGE difference in a months time. I didn&#x27;t just use Xtreme Bright Gel. I also stopped shaving with a razor I now use a Panasonic electric Razor, I exfoliate with Tree Hut sugar scrub use the normal brush on my Mia2 and I use a ALUMINUM FREE deodorant (Tom&#x27;s of Maine). I also combine Nadinola cream two or three times a week with the gel. My underarms are not 100% back to its original skintone but 60-70% improved. Good Luck</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dark elbows and saw no difference after about a month. It actually made my elbows appear ashy after using it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try xtreme brite gel. I had seen so many reviews on the internet (amazon and youtube) but I had never heard of anyone using it in real life. However, ambi and other products never worked for me for for dark spots or underarms so I was eager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it worked fine, but very slow. However, my underarms did get lighter. I also used it on my knees, which I saw no change on except for peeling which was odd.&lt;br /&gt;I even stopped using regular deodorant which was suggested  by reviewers of the gel and I also wax my underarms which I&#x27;ve been doing for years.  After using almost 3 tubes in one month, I decided to stop and see and low and behold, within days, my underarms got dark again but even darker than before but this time they wont lighten back up. I desperately tried using the gel again but it is not budging.  I also started getting severe pain under my arms after stopping again which my esthetician pointed out as stretchmarks under the arms when waxing. I was so shocked so I will never ever use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUt I may just be one of the exceptions.</li>
    <li> Extremely irritating for skin, skin starts to turn red and it peels off!! Your skin actually peels of from the redness and dryness, will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Didnt work. And really sticky .scent not to great either.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually make a review on a certain product,  but after using Xtreme brite 2 weeks ago for my underarms it just made it much darker!  My underarm started to peel and itchy. Then it became red and just turned dark.  Now I am problematic what can I apply with my dark underarms because I already stop using Xtreme brite.  I think if you really want to use this product, use it at your own risk. But definitely I&#x27;m not recommending this product.  I also just I ordered the Xtreme soap and same thing im scared to use it on my skin.  Everything was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Did not like the product. Didn&#x27;t last long. Small tube to expensive. It actually made ny skin turn darker on the spots that I had applied it to however fast shipping just not worth it</li>
    <li> I bought this because i think my armpits are a little bit darker than they should be. But I&#x27;ve been  using this for about 3 weeks and i dont see any difference. The gel dries slow and like i said i dont see any improvements in the color.</li>
    <li> Took some time to see results But worked well ...  Was sticky</li>
    <li> Product delivered in a timely manner.  Effective. .... actually seeing results.  Just wish size was bigger. Will be ordering more...... definitely need more than one tube to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Please do not waste your money on this product. This product is like putting water on your skin. This company should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> I am a white woman who has medium skin tone, and I honestly never knew I had black armpits until I was tying my hair up one day and my husband asked why my armpits were black. I went and looked in the mirror, and immediately felt so embarrassed for all the times I wore tank tops in public. I didn&#x27;t know there was a product for black pits, so lived with my pits for three more years before stumbling onto this stuff. I saw awesome reviews on YouTube for it, so I bought some. I&#x27;ve been using the Xtreme Brite for about a month, using it once a day, and I am happy to say that one of my arm pits has completely faded, and the other is right around the corner, with a light brown tint to it still. I already bought a second tube in preparation for when I run out of my first. I&#x27;m so so so happy with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I am fairly light complected but as a teen I suffered from acne, overtime I developed scaring on my face from the years of acne. Now that the acne is gone I am left with reddish/brown spots on my face, cheeks, chin and forehead. It&#x27;s just been a week now but I can already see a big improvement in my skin. Most of the spots have already begun to fade away and I just know if I continue to use it, it will only look better.... I would definitely recommend this product for someone that&#x27;s looking for something to improve their skins appearance from acne. The price was fair and affordable and my shipping arrived on time as expected.</li>
    <li> Yesterday was my 3rd day sing the product. Already the skin AROUND the affected area is red and irritated. Could I have an allergic reaction? Is that supposed to happen? Did i use to much in those 3 days?Doubt it...I was really excited but quickly found out maybe it isn&#x27;t for me. Haven&#x27;t seen any reviews about redness so not sure if I should discontinue.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything but dry your skin. It&#x27;s a waste of money. You can use water to get similar results.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Helped lighten the skin tone&lt;br /&gt;pretty small tube - would be happy if it was lil bigger container</li>
    <li> This worked wonders! For several years Ive tried numerous remedies and deodorants to cure my dark-underarms and this has done its job. Im so glad I found this, it&#x27;s been a month and I&#x27;ve definitely seen a large improvement.</li>
    <li> I used two tubes, I so wanted it to work, it is definitely priced well but I saw absolutely no difference in my acne scars, age spots or dark spots</li>
    <li> I am a white female attempting to fade some freckling and sun damage on the backs of my hands. I saw no noticeable imrovement after 2x daily use for 3 months. If you are looking for a bleaching/lightening creme without hydroquinone, keep looking. This product does contain hydroquinone, and at a lower percentage than any readily available fade creme you can purchase at your local drugstore. It is nothing special. Combine the lower percentage of \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients with a cheap, obnoxious scent and you have a dog of a product. My apologies to all dog lovers. Bottom line: don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this stuff.</li>
    <li> Works good but you really have to keep putting it</li>
    <li> So I bought this product a few months ago and I just decided to write a review. I used it every night for a couple weeks on my underarms and I noticed my skin getting lighter in some spots. After a while I noticed many bumps and pimples showing up and they were pretty painful so I stopped using it. It was embarassing to have these huge irritating bumps in my underarms but it got scary..&lt;br /&gt;I had a very large bump on the top of my underarm and it was not a pimple. It hurt and it felt it and it seemed to be connected to something which felt like a vein. I looked it up and everything said its a symptom to underarm cancer. I got freaked out I wanted to see a doctor but my mother told me to wait it out to see what happens. It eventually disappeared and never bothered me again. I was scared and im not sure if it was caused by the gel. I haven&#x27;t used it but I would really like to cuz I bought two bottles and there still full!!! Has anyone had similar experiences?</li>
    <li> Awesome for dark spot lightning. My face started getting light right after i finished the 1 st tube. My skin got one shade lighter. This is amazing and i love it. But i recommend to apply it on areas needed at night or when you have anywhere to go. Its really creasy and shiny but as long as it work i honestly dont care about the shine. Thanks</li>
    <li> I honestly wish it came in a larger bottle because this little tube really doesn&#x27;t last that long.  I would recommend getting the 3 pack but if you use it only once a day (not twice as it recommends) one tube would only really last you maybe 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I am not complaining.  It&#x27;s very effective and works very quickly.  I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it twice a day bc it is so strong and although you want the product to work, I don&#x27;t think you want it to work overnight as that would make it extremely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product has really helped to even out my skin tone.  Like others, I did experience breaking out slightly on my chest and shoulders which is an area I have never broken out before.  That is a negative side effect but I would still use the product.  The break outs went away after a couple of weeks and I began mixing the product with some lotion and I think that seems to help.  I think the breaking out is a result of your skin being dry and so making sure to keep your skin hydrated is very important.  A lot of people probably don&#x27;t want to overwhelm their skin and so they skip adding another lotion regimen on top of their already twice a day brite gel regimen.  My tip would be to use brite gel only once and lotion up once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably on my 3rd tube now.  I still really love the product and will definitely continue to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m asian (lives in Singapore) with tan skin and like most asians, i experience skin discoloration on my underarms, inner thighs etc. After months of research and searching for the perfect solution to my problem, i&#x27;ve decided to try the xtreme brite gel. i bought 2 tubes and a bar of the xtreme brite soap and after using one full tube which lasted me 2 months and the xtreme brite soap i have seen a major difference on my underarm. My underarms are clearer and softer than before, i definitely recommend the product to those of you who&#x27;s experiencing the same problem. Here&#x27;s some of the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s of using this product (i hope it will help some of you who are looking into using this product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Gel smells good&lt;br /&gt;- Gel acts as a deoderant&lt;br /&gt;- One tube lasts 2 months if used twice a day in pea sized portion (Value for money)&lt;br /&gt;- Gel really works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You have to stop shaving in order for the gel to work (which is not really a problem for me as i prefer plucking my underarm hair cos they leave my underarm feeling softer and smoother.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- if used too much it will burn your skin as in your skin will get darker than usual (so please use with caution and with the directed amount only!! if unsure do check some of the video reviews on youtube)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- you will sweat a lot on your underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it for my review, i hope this review would help all the sceptics out there. my advice is give it a try if it works for me, with patience than i&#x27;m sure it will work for you as well. As for me xtreme brite will definitely be my prefered brand :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and I am seeing good results.  I haven&#x27;t gotten rid of all the dark spots but hopefully with continued use it will go away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter due to stubborn acne scars. She started using this product last week and in less that 7 days, her face is starting to look clear and amazing. The consistency of this gel is like aloe vera gel or a serum. So, she applies her moisturizer right after she applies this product. I will continue to observe how she responds to this gel and probably discontinue when all the scars are gone......Will definitely suggest this product to all who struggle with this type of problem.</li>
    <li> The reviews got me very excited. So, I bought this thing. I have started using the product. I have applied it on my armpits, knees, lower tummy and elbows. My elbows and knees are naturally black while my skin in general is light brown. I had a bad reaction with one of the hair removal creams and got my armpits all burnt. I am allergic to several metals, this one belt-metallic, I wore once burnt my low tummy region and it&#x27;s pitch black over there. Nothing (scrubs, lemons, other tangy fruits or strawberries) has ever helped me removing these out-place-natural pigmentation and burns. Let&#x27;s see how Xtreme Brite fairs in due course of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all this product didn&#x27;t sting me despite the fact that when I spray perfume over my underarms, it burns like hell. So, this is a good thing, I can apply Xtreme Brite in the morning after shower and forget about it till night time application. This product says that it&#x27;s for the face to remove acne marks. I haven&#x27;t applied on my face yet although I do have some marks to worry about. I am using Xtreme Brite on other areas to see if thing works like the reviews claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so, this is the 5th day of my observation: My underarms were impossibly dark and now I can see a much cleansed one. I still cannot lift up my arm in public but my boyfriend greatly appreciated the improvement. I wasn&#x27;t embarrassed, some confi was there when I was with him, that&#x27;s all. So, I can see my actual skin color of the underarm that I had before it got all burnt up. The thing is, you have to apply this gel minimum two times a day and also forever otherwise you will lose the effect. Make sure before applying that you gently cleansed your skin with some light soap, like face wash etc., so this gel is obsorbed evenly on the skin. Also apply it sparingly, like make only one coat over the darkened region. This will make the gel be absorbed by the darkened skin region and avoid the other region to absorb it. Now the gel has no mind of itsown, it will lighten any skin it can find, if you will focus on surrounding light skin, it will lighten that up too. The best way is to first apply only on the dark spots/regions and bring those to the level of your surrounding skin and then apply on the entire area to even out the skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps as it helped me.</li>
    <li> I have been using the gel on  my armpits for about a month now, with no improvement whatsoever. Will keep using it until the tube is empty. Hopefully I will see some improvement.</li>
    <li> I do see a difference in color it is much lighter, but nothing DRAMATIC but there is def. a difference.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using this gel. It does wonders for my skin. I want to use it on my whole body but the tube is too small, so I just use it on my face, neck and ears. I love it! it makes my skin so tight, smooth and pretty and it brightened up my sun damaged brown skin back to caramel honey brown; my skin looks so pretty and smooth.I will keep buying this gel,I love how it smells also. So clean and fresh. This is actually my second time using it,at first I got dark marks around the mouth area, but I was using the gel with Rx for brown skin products and I guess the products didn&#x27;t mix too well. But now im just using this for my face and taking Vitamin C Crystalline.(Ascorbic Acid fine granular bulk crystalline powder by Prescribed For Life you can find them here on Amazon) Their Vitamin C is the best. It does taste sour but it will make your skin super smooth and glowy in conjunction with this gel. I have been taking their Vitamin C crystalline for 3 weeks and it not only brightens my skin but it also helps to proctect it from the sun because Vitamin C inhibits the skin from producing more melanin thus making you lighter. I&#x27;m very happy.Both the vitamin c and Xtreme Brite Gel are the perfect combo for my skin. I have such beautiful,smooth skin. My skin glows so much that my mother actually thought I had a pregnancy glow. lol. I told her I&#x27;m nowhere near pregnant just healthy.</li>
    <li> this product peels your skin so badly.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin but I don&#x27;t recommend it. try for yourself. or don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> it some time to start seeing results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a light skin Latin but my underarms I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re darker. So I got this gel and I spent hours looking at the reviews and videos of it. The videos convinced me about this product. So I gaved it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks. I do see a little change. Nothing big like the YouTube vids I&#x27;ve seen. Also I&#x27;m almost out of the gel and I just purchase the cream. Hopefully the cream does a better job... Other than that I haven&#x27;t shaved well I did once and the next say I notice a slight red rash. So I stop using the gel for a day. Then I continue. I don&#x27;t wear deorante. I&#x27;m literally following every step. Like I said I do see a change but nothing were I&#x27;m super happy about. I guess I have to be more patience. I&#x27;ll post a review about the cream. Hopefully my review help you guys! :)</li>
    <li> didnot work at all on my skin, :( But it has nice scent and it&#x27;s not greasy once applied on skin.</li>
    <li> This works great! It took me about 3 weeks to notice a difference. I definitely re-ordered already. I try not to use any deodorant with aluminum in it unless I really have to. The bad thing about this product is that once you stop using it, your skin will turn dark again. So, you have to keep using it. I don&#x27;t mind that I have to keep using it because the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> i have been using this for only a week and have started to see results. I was skeptical at first but when I saw my skin changing and clearing up I was impressed. I have been using this product twice a day on the dark areas on my neck. I am a mixed woman who has very sensitive skin but this has not caused me any problems so far. I&#x27;m sure my darker skin will completely go away in a few weeks!</li>
    <li> bought 2 bottle to try. used it as directed. Did not do anything at all. this product is a waste of money. This is my first time making a review on amazon reason being this is the worst product i have ever bought from amazon with such a high rating.</li>
    <li> This product has potential but I will say right now that if you only buy one you&#x27;re probably going to need more, especially if you have lots of darkening. I have dark underarms, and a few patches of dark skin elsewhere and this product did lighten some, but one tube was NOT enough. It smells nice which is a huge plus (most chemical compounds smell really bad) and it applies smoothly. The gel itself is clear and appears to not stain garments which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to a few areas of my body. My inner thighs/vaginal area, between my breasts, and on the edges of my underarms. It took away the ash colored skin between my breasts and lightened up my extreme inner thighs/vaginal area which was great, but it did not do much to my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;There are also no application instructions available for the product on the tube which I think is mildly frustrating. If I knew how often to apply it and how much I think my results would have been much better. Even the site has no instructions for application. I will probably buy this product again because it did lighten my skin in some areas, but there are some kinks I think that need to be worked out.</li>
    <li> this product is awesome works fast and is a very good price also try it guys youll love the results !! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used it for a few months to combat under arm darkness and it did work. I would wax my under arms, clean them, put the product on atleast 24 hours later twice a day. I have hyperpigmentaton so if it works for me, it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
    <li> This product works!  I use it once daily and use a natural deodorant to combat odor! I still shave because the epilator was toooooooo painful!  Stay away from aluminum in your deodorant and you WILL see results!</li>
    <li> You should see my elbows and knees now. I love this product. I did some research on it first. A lot of people say it&#x27;s not for the full body and I saw why. It&#x27;s a small tube. Didn&#x27;t come with any instructions either. I was skeptical, but I do not regret my purchase.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my acne marks.</li>
    <li> Waste of money! Made my skin extra dry and flaky, no results either!</li>
    <li> Do not purchase. It burns the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost done with the tube and have noticed a big difference. I am hispanic so my underarms are a bit darker. It irritated my skin a bit so for a few days I only used it once a day then on to twice a day. Like others have said you don&#x27;t even need deoderant when using this. I work in construction so I get pretty sweaty but It works pretty good as a deoderant. I still do shave so maybe my results aren&#x27;t as great but I&#x27;m planning on buying another tube when this ones done. If you don&#x27;t see results right away just continue using it. It&#x27;s what I did and my results are pretty darn great!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for getting rid of dark spots but it did smooth out my skin so 3 stars,</li>
    <li> Great acne scar remover!</li>
    <li> It is a hoax. I used all the gel for almost two months and there was no change in my skin tone. I do not recommend buying it ...</li>
    <li> I used it for 2 months and was very happy with the results but after i stopped using it for a week my under arms got darker again.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does, use it on my dark spots on my face daily and within 2 weeks i can see the difference</li>
    <li> so far 1st tube for under arms.... results still pending.... not sure if i will purchase again ... will know when finished with the entire tube...... not much of a change yet</li>
    <li> My friend bought me this gel, that is why i am not a verified buyer. But i wanted to write a review. Here is why. Most of the reviews i read or even watched on youtube confirmed that this product works and so i was very excited to try it out. I have used it for about a month now. My tube is almost gone. I can say i cannot see any visible different on my underarm skin. It is exactly the same as it was before using this product. I used this gel 2 times a day every day and did not use any other products (deodorant or etc). The one thing i can say that this gel worked almost like a deodorant for me.. I mean it is summer now and i don&#x27;t smell or anything. But it didn&#x27;t really do what it was meant for. Update: okay, i may have spoken too soon. I&#x27;d say i notice some changes. maybe about 50%? I am however going to continue using this to see what happens.</li>
    <li> Finally. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a product that really lightens skin. THIS PRODUCT WORKS. I understand people have different skin and not everything works for everybody. Out of all the products on the market I was more skeptical about this one (because of the bad reviews) plus I didn&#x27;t like the price for the size of the tube. Well dammit Idc about the size of the product anymore because this stuff lightened my skin. I won&#x27;t lie it wont work over night and it wont work in two weeks. This is a slow process but if you have about a mth to a mth and a half of patience I promise you wont be disappointed. Im a black male looking at my old pics I was probably dark brown like Lil Wayne&#x27;s complexion (google his pics) now i&#x27;m Trey songz complexion. BIG DIFFERENCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this you have to be dedicated. You have to use this product with a very good lightning soap and you have to use it 2 to 3 times a day. It&#x27;s a must if you want it to work. Personally I only use it twice a day every 12 hrs after my shower. I don&#x27;t use it 3 times because I don&#x27;t want to end up white and this product will do that to you. A lot of people probably left bad reviews because they didn&#x27;t have the patience and gave up on it or they were probably already light. It shows better if you&#x27;re dark because you&#x27;ll be able to see the lightening effect. It works slow but it really works. Oh yea before I go, the tube is small but you can make it stretch if you don&#x27;t use too much. you don&#x27;t need a lot like lotion. Put a couple dabs on the area you want to lighten and just spread it all around like lotion. I NEVER GIVE 5 STARS. I gave this product 5 because it works. I am a light brown skin AND I LOVE IT WOOT WOOT</li>
    <li> While I originally bought this gel to lighten dark marks under my eyes, I used it to also clear up a pimple scar I had on my back.  The back spot went away, but it really didn&#x27;t do much for my under eyes.</li>
    <li> Over the past few months I began noticing my skin changing-- I had what looked like a Melasma face mask, my whole entire face was darker except for around my eyes.  Note: I have had a lot of exospore to sun, which is damaging to a person’s skin.  Therefore, I believe that is most of my problem.&lt;br /&gt;However, I started using this gel about a week ago and I apply it each morning before showering and I leave it on my face until I am about to get out of the shower. And at night I leave it on while I am brushing my teeth. I do apply a bit more on the darkest spots on my face. I started noticing results this week- when I was wipe my face I could see the brownish coloring fading (it was like it was coming off some, while I was wiping my face. But I must say, I see progress! My normal complexion is coming back--but one thing I must say the gel has a great smell and it DOES NOT IRATATE my skin!!!! It also appears to help me acne, I was sort of worried about it acting breaking my face out, but it did not… (The directions on the box are not very clear, therefore, I tested it out for myself and made my own directions and it is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I do recommend this product and I just order another tube for just in case matters… It may cause ones face to become sensitive to sun light, so I would suggest using sunscreen or a hat.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to lighten some dark spots and my underarms, and after trying other more expensive products, decided to try this. I was more convinced after reading the reviews, they were a great help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product really works! I used the gel once a day on the underarms, and it lightened the dark areas, just as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be re-ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product. To tell you the truth you won&#x27;t see result right away it take about 3 week to a month to see results. The first time I bought it I was excited I put on this product two to three times a day on my armpita.It took a while to see result but it does work. It is pretty expensive the last time I bought it was 9.99 so I will wait until the price goes down. But It Does work. BTW first time writing a review. Next time I buy I will upload pic using this product so you can see it yourself.</li>
    <li> I am a very light skinned girl, very pale, but I have the darkest armpits and inner thighs you can possibly imagine which doesn&#x27;t even match the rest of my skin tone. Which is very embarrassing in the bedroom, like if us girls didnt suffer enough. I have tried every single product out there but this one was the only one that actually worked for me. I saw immediate results but the only downfall of this product is that it did make my skin peel and very irritated. The redness did go away, but it did work for me. I plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> didnt work for me i used the whole tube...</li>
    <li> Started to see good improvement on my under arms when I ran out...its a food product just wish u get more for the price will purchase again soon</li>
    <li> I appreciate timely ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tube is small...I&#x27;m almost finished with it already ,it helps pretty well and I&#x27;ve seen changes in my scars . It&#x27;s still a work in progress ,I&#x27;ll order another while i look for good alternates</li>
    <li> This gel really does lighten dark spots.  It took about 6 months but the spot is completely gone.</li>
    <li> Trash. I threw it out. Skin problems galore!!!</li>
    <li> Did not work.  Returned.</li>
    <li> OMG, just what is in this thing? I have tried just about anything. Cheap creams, expensive creams, exfoliating creams, salicylic acid and other kinds of acids but nothing worked. I applied this and it feels sticky at first but it absorbs. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell but it&#x27;s tolerable, especially since it works. After a few minutes, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face. My face is so soft. The next day, my face looks clearer. It does seem my blackheads are gone. After 3 days, even the small pimples at the corners of my mouth are starting to become smaller. They&#x27;ve been there for a month or so and won&#x27;t disappear no matter how often I apply pimple cream. The bumps on my left eyebrow that have been there for months disappeared! I was actually starting to consider treating them with raw garlic before. I will keep using to see if it would do something on my dark spots. So far so good! I am light brown-skinned Asian. I am not looking to lighten my skin. I just want blemish-free, even toned, clear skin. Maybe it does not work on others as people have different skin types and different chemical reactions but it certainly works for me.</li>
    <li> it is described as a miracle cream but it didn&#x27;t do anything to me</li>
    <li> Really, it&#x27;s just okay. I like how it is easy on my skin though. I have sensitive, dry prone skin and I was worried it would irritate it and cause me to break out. It stung the first couple of times I applied it, but after that, the cream goes on smooth and cool. I like the slight scent of it, and I feel like overtime, with continual use, it will brighten the face. I have seen an improvement overall with the tone of my complexion, it does seem to be more even, and some of my discoloration is not as noticeable. I do like the product better for its skin tightening attributes. I am not sure if that is the goal, but my skin isn&#x27;t susceptible to break outs like prior to use, and my skin feels firmer after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month today, and it DOES work.. I experienced no itching, burning, drying or things of that sort. I actually bought it bc after being pregnant and gaining 40+ lbs &amp;#60;&amp;#60; i know right! lol and I was only 120 to begin with! &amp; After having my baby I  had a small pooch on my tummy that was just  extremely dark...&amp; everyone noticed. I used it after every shower am and pm and now that spot on my tummy is actually a shade lighter than the rest of me! oops...lol but yes this is the BEST!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using on my Bottom. I used to sit for a long time and that made me have big dark spot on my bottom.&lt;br /&gt;First week after I used, It looked brighter. After that, the more i use, the dryer my bottom gets.&lt;br /&gt;So, I use Xtreme Brite Brightening Gel 1 time per day and use Vitamin E cream once a day.&lt;br /&gt;it looks working.</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit hesitant to buy this product, I didn&#x27;t think that anything would clear up by dark underarms. However, after a daily application I immediately started seeing results. My underarms are now an even and clear complexion. Even after I discontinued using this product for a few months, the darkness under my underarms didn&#x27;t return. I&#x27;m currently using this product to lighten my elbows. After it is applied, this product might feel a bit wet but it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. It also has a nice, subtle fragrance. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Ok so I hoped on the YouTube bandwagon and decided to buy one gel 1oz container to test out product first. I had such big expectations as I so wanted to lighten my underarms. First of all, I&#x27;m not a true woman of color. I am a lighter Hispanic female, though not as light as JLo or Alba, but a little lighter than Camilla Alves. Well anyways, I have had dark underarms for so long and recently started using natural deodorants with no aluminum. I saw many YouTube videos of women of color saying this worked for them. Well, I have been using this product for about 2 months, and have seen NO change whatsoever. I have since also bought Dermadoctor Lightening Deodorant from Sephora last month in hopes of extra lightening.....nothing has happend. I am so disappointed with such expensive products and feel I should have used home remedies instead of shelling out this money. Not sure if this product only works on darker skin? I will now be trying baking soda paste and lemon juice remedies twice daily.</li>
    <li> I started noticing a change on the 3rd day.... but by the 4th time i put it on at night...oh what a surprise in the morning... my underams were f****** dark.... darker than before I started using this crap.... now I have to figure what the hell to do to reverse the effects :&#x27;(  not happy!</li>
    <li> I have noticed my underarms lightening. I have been using it for about a month, in the morning and again at night. So far so good!</li>
    <li> It has been 2 1/2 weeks and my 2nd tube of Xtreme Brite Brightening Gel and I&#x27;m still waiting to experience the difference everyone seems to have had while using this product.  I am led to believe that the people who are experiencing the skin lightening effects of this gel are receiving some compensation for their fabrication.  However,  if in the future I notice a change/s, I will be sure to return on this site and give an honest account of my skin lightening areas.</li>
    <li> Save your money. It doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. The tube is travel sized and it doesn&#x27;t even work. I&#x27;m a light brown color and it didn&#x27;t brighten my face or underarms like I expected it to. Maybe it only works on lighter skinned people.</li>
    <li> Does this work for vaginal area</li>
    <li> I used this gel to lighten my anus and surrounding area. I&#x27;d say this skin was about 3 shades darker than the rest of my body (I am kind of fair with a rosy complexion). After using this product for a week I could see results, and I was quite happy. I applied it twice daily and was careful to only apply to the area that needed lightening. Over a 2 day period, I was unable to apply it and I noticed that the skin started to become darker and redder than it was before I even started using the product. Now instead of a lightish brown, my anus is almost purple or maroon. It looks like a heavy bruise. It&#x27;s weird and disturbing and I definitely would NOT recommend that anyone use this product on their intimate areas. The price of this product appealed to me, and so I bought it because it&#x27;s cheap. I decided I needed an intervention to cure my bruised looking anus and just now bought Dr. Pinks Anal Brightening Cream on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. I will place a review on that product as well. I hope it fixes what Xtreme Bright Brightening Gel did to my anus.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all for me and for the price and the  reviews I expected more.</li>
    <li> Amazing gel ... It&#x27;s really help to reduce blackness of underarms ... Worth it</li>
    <li> I use it under my eyes and on tops of my cheeks , front of my nose and on my forehead so i have a natural highlight  , and every girl loves that celebrity glow right ...well i dont even have to use highlighter on the areas of my face  because this stuff made those parts 2 shades lighter! Wow and when i do use the highlighter its just so great, my face is glowing and o so bright! Thats why im like holly Sh!+ this stuff works because im in ahhh because it was a cheap product so inexpensive, but im ordering it forever now. I shouldnt of shared this secret but owell ! Try it out its not just for dark armpits  LOL</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 2 different products from this brand and they both failed. I&#x27;m not buying anymore from them. Just gave me rashes</li>
    <li> Didnt do nothing for me! On top of that its supee small i didnt know it would be a small tube! It smelled good but like I said, it did nothing for me, &amp; I used it everyday accordingly</li>
    <li> I Have Been Using This Product For About 2 Weeks And I See Great Results!! Id Suggest This Product To Friends :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any  results,  however  ive only  had the product  a week,  using  it every day.</li>
    <li> I tried it for dark marks on my chin area where i shave, chin and cheek area, and it did not lighten the marks. I&#x27;m a medium-dark male, age 27, with course hair that gets ingrown every now and then and causes bumps which cause scars. This cream didn&#x27;t help them go away, but i am not sure if it was made for that. Dried my skin out the sliiiightest bit, nothing lotion or aloe or cocoa butter didn&#x27;t fix. Smell was pleasing, its easy to use, for the price I am not upset it didn&#x27;t work. Gonna try Ambi cream again</li>
    <li> nothing.... No results, I used it everyday until it was gone but nothing</li>
    <li> It burns my skin didn&#x27;t work for me I used it for my under arms</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American female with absolutely horrible dark looking armpits. My skin color is like Carmel, but my armpits are dark chocolate brown on the verge of black. I used this product for about 2 months straight, and I had high hopes for it to work especially after hearing all the raves about it. At first I thought I seen improvements during the first 2 weeks (or maybe it was just all in my head) but then I realized nothing really changed at all. My armpits are still  absolutely disgusting looking, and may have  even gotten slightly worse......I&#x27;ve tried everything. Now  I really don&#x27;t know what else to do to fix them. The gel does smell pretty good though.....I&#x27;m really upset that it didn&#x27;t work for me though. It&#x27;s depressing having to continue to be embarrassed to wear bathing suits, sleeveless tops, or to lift my arms; but I guess some us are just permanently cursed with dark armpits. :(&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough of it? I have no clue. I used almost 2 tubes of it. I still have half a tube left. I do notice that this gel made my armpits itch, burn  and peel at times, but nothing.&lt;br /&gt;No it didn&#x27;t work for me. But it worked for plenty of others so it still may be worth a shot for you to try so good luck.</li>
    <li> Must use every morning and night on clean area and never the same day as a wax or shave</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my neck and armpits. Big mistake....! It burn my skin. Even when used it just as the instructions said I should. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I just used half of the tube and already noticed a huge difference in my underarms darkness!! It works.&lt;br /&gt;I mostly used it once at night or twice sometimes. Although I didn&#x27;t use it everyday but definitely it works!!</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first it being a gel.After a week the dark pigmentation started fading. Also I only use it on the dark spots Im going to continue using this product I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> NOR MY pits, or chacha. or my pimples on my face.. i should have just got hydroquinone. i know its got cancer causing agents blah blah blah but so does chanel lipstick and your cell phone. and that hot dog you just ate. and the tv u watch.  this def didnt work. idk if i can return it. perhaps i should try. im sad. i dont even remember how much i spent . but i know hydroquinone workkekd and this didnt.. booo 2 that</li>
    <li> I used this cream to try and fade chicken pox scars (dark spots) on my chin from when I was 4 and let me tell you! I never imagined that I would be able to fade them, but this gel did it in about two weeks. It was amazing. Granted I did apply a glycolic cream on first then used the gel, but I have been using the glycolic cream for a year now and it has never given me similar results. Since these spots go down to my neck I thought I would try applying the gel on there as well, and even though I only applied if twice I could already see the skin peeling off. This product works wonders!</li>
    <li> Just love it . I already order it again!!!</li>
    <li> I would give this a 5star but I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks. So far I am seeing good results.  I brought 3 different products to address some skin discolorations from eczema and another skin condition that i have which causes my skin to thicken and darken. I initially planned to use this only on my neck which I have not been able to lighten for years even after going to the dermatologist (this is where i have the skin thickening condition which makes me look like a have a black ring around my neck). However with the use of this product I am seeing some lightening in this area.  Its not back to my normal complexion but I am impressed. I was using the other products on my area for eczema in combination with the rx from the doc  but wasnt seeing the good results. So I decided to use this on those areas too. I am so impressed, this seems to work better on my eczema than what i get from the doctor. What the doctor gives me doesnt really restore my complexion to its normal state as well, i am guessing that this has some kind of skin exfoliation ingredient because it seems the dead skin is coming off better with this and in turn i am slowly starting to see my normal complexion again. I was scared to use this all over at first because some people said it would make the skin pink but this doesn&#x27;t seem to lighten my skin more than bringing it to its normal complexion but perhaps its because I have only used it for a short time.  I am ordering more.  This time I will try the cream since you get more than when ordering the gel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product last summer as I was tired of seeing my dark underarms and not being able to wear any tank tops or sleeveless tops. I did a lot of research about this product and I was convinced that I should try it. I used a small amount of the product under my arms and after just 2-3 weeks I was amazed at how light under my arms were getting. I had to purchase several tubes because I was running out of the product even if I was not using it every single day. After I was close to being satisfied with the results, I decided to stop using the product. Under my arms became so itchy after I stopped and I now have very deep, deep stretch marks under my arms. I am now stuck with these huge, awful scars and before I couldn&#x27;t wear tank tops because my underarms were dark. Now, not only did all the darkness came back, but now I can NEVER wear any tank tops or any sleeveless tops because I have horrendous stretch marks on my arms. My before and after pictures are unsightly. I absolutely hate this product and I hope that it gets taken off the market. I spent almost $100 on purchasing this product. Now I have to get surgery done to cut out the stretch marks from my arms. Do not purchase this product. It is the worst!</li>
    <li> Works very well. And pretty fast considering this is an at home treatment. After two weeks my butt looks very cute. The reason why I&#x27;m giving this four stars is because it makes your skin very dry, long with skin peeling off.</li>
    <li> I had to admit I was a little skeptical about purchasing this product, BUT we&#x27;ll never know if we don&#x27;t take initiate to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried numerous things to get rid of dark underarms, like lime, baking soda, different deodorants and the darkness was still there as well as odor due to the darkness. It was beyond embarrassing because where I work is hot at times, and it consists of walking so you can imagine how bad it was 😔 until I tried this product. I can honestly say this product has been working very well 👍😄 I am seeing great results&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have to use deodorant I just apply the gel and go on with my day without smelling.  I&#x27;m still going for more and I am encouraging everyone to try it.&lt;br /&gt;God bless you all</li>
    <li> Im in love with this, it&#x27;s so versatile. I&#x27;ve used it in the most sensitive areas and it does not burn at all. My skintone is not dark at all and this item reminds me so much of the brand mederma. I&#x27;m so glad i found this product.</li>
    <li> Well, I gave this an honest try. I used it everyday for a month on my underarms, an old scar,a new scar, even my undereye circles! Nothing! This must just be placebo in a tube, nothing got lighter, brighter, or changed color in any way. Luckily I didn&#x27;t have any negative side effects, but I think that after a month it&#x27;s safe to label this product a dud. Save your money.</li>
    <li> i started using this product when i bought it in march. i was very skeptical since many of the reviews on here were either really good, or really bad. I used in consistently in the beginning, applying a pea sized amount of product to both underams every night and morning. I started getting lazy with it so maybe thats why i did not see results until like the 3rd or 4th week. I am using this product with my Nivea whitening deodorant which i also purchased on amazon, and my koji san kojic acid whitening soap. Even though i am also using these products along with the xtreme brightening gel, i am convinced the majority reason for my results is the gel. Most people on here stop shaving and start waxing, BUT i keep shaving because its easiest for me, and also it has not made my underarms any worse. My underarms are brighter and clearer and i am so happy with the results. I ordered my second tube because one did not quite get my underarms as perfect as i want them to, even though i could keep them the way that they are because they are NO where near as bad as they used to be!I am way more confident now, i can wear the tanks and dresses that i was too embarrassed to wear before and i am just really happy! i really recommend this product to anyone dealing with this issue, and to keep in mind not to overuse this product. It seems that some people on here burned their armpits because they would apply too much. Be patient with this product and you will see results!</li>
    <li> Based on the previous reviews, I bought this to see if it works for my dark armpit (because of regular shaving). It did make a considerable changes after 2-3 weeks of use. I apply it once a day and it reduces bad odour aswell. The only reason I am giving 4 star is, its a slow process!  I almost used the whole tube, still its not to my natural tone. It requires repeated, continuous use. I would recommand this product. Its worth it.</li>
    <li> First off I want to start off saying I&#x27;m mexican, medium to tan skin and I develop dark marks easily. I used this gel on my arm pits in the morning and at night without using any deodorant or antiperspirant. Yes it is a bit risky going out in public without either of those, but I basically used the gel as a deodorant and I didn&#x27;t really smell, and I don&#x27;t sweat a lot as it is. It took about a week to see a significant change, and now I don&#x27;t have any darkness what so ever. I also stopped shaving my armpits and instead bought an epilator to get rid of the hairs, and I use TOMS deodorant which contains only natural ingredients that aren&#x27;t harmful to skin. It&#x27;s as if they were never dark and I still use the gel every now and then just to make sure no darkness comes back.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my elbows and they are now light as well. It also works really well for dark acne scars. I love this gel.</li>
    <li> I never received my product and I don&#x27;t recommend buying from this person. I have purchased this product before, though and it was great. Three applications in three days and I noticed there was a significant difference.</li>
    <li> doesnt work - doesnt hurt either</li>
    <li> Okay the only reason why i gave this product five stars is because of the delivery. The product arrived on time. I just started using it so it&#x27;s too soon to tell whether it works or not. However, I will be posting an update later on. My only complain is that it is too expensive. I mean I spent $30+ plus dollars and the gel is only 1oz.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work on me.</li>
    <li> I got enthused by all the positive comments, and decided to try it on my underarms. I must say that I&#x27;ve always had this issue. I applied it night and day. I liked that it had a deodorant effect, as I would not develop odors. As for the skin: it first seemed that it was getting brighter, until I realized with horror that the gel was in fact spreading the pigmentation around. So in other words, the pigmentation is not as focused on one spot, but instead spread around, forming a larger (still darker) areola under my arm. My problem just became bigger, I&#x27;m so disappointed !  I have no doubt the product does something, but it might depend on the type of pigmentation, or what makes the skin darker ? Just did not work for me, and made things worse.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product that would help lighten my underarms.  For as long as I remember, my underarms have always been dark and it was embarassing!  I tried this product and it lightened my underarms...it was beautiful!  Perhaps I haven&#x27;t discovered the secret yet and would like for somebody to share, but I can&#x27;t seem to maintain the clarity when off this product.  I wax my underarms and decided to resume deodorant usage (and tried Dove clear tone) upon finishing this 1 tube, but it has darkened some already.  I&#x27;d like for the lightness to become permanent, anybody have a clue?</li>
    <li> no results for blotchiness!</li>
    <li> SOOOOO...... 3 TUBES LATER and my skin is worse than before!!  I am devastated as I had really high hopes for this product - coming from the UK there really isn&#x27;t many products for brown/dark skin tones out there so I really take the risk and put my faith in these type of products with the hope of success.    I bought this originally to clear up some dark marks on my face and body as I scar very very easily (hopefully some of you can relate). I rarely get spots but when I do they leave a mark even if I do not tamper/touch them. There&#x27;s nothing I can do about my sensitive skin or excess melanin which leaves the dark marks. However this gel promised to reduce the production of melanin and in turn fade &amp; prevent marks ... this was the original selling point for me. 4 MONTHS LATER AND I HAVE WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY. My skin broke out terrible and then left marks which were made darker by the gel.. I am so angry as my face is disgusting right now and 10 times worse than before.    At first I didn&#x27;t want to be sceptical of Xtreme Brite as I know that with every new product you use your skin has to adapt to it; especially with sensitive skin. I&#x27;d also spent a lot of money (inc shipping to UK) So I dealt with a couple of pimples here and there as I really wanted it to work miracles for me.. but when I noticed everyday I was getting new ones in places I NEVER got them - I realised it was Xtreme Brite. N.B - The gel contains perfume/fragrance which smells very strong and is off putting; I don&#x27;t see why a lightening gel needs to have perfume in it? I&#x27;m guessing this is one of the reasons we are all breaking out so bad and getting rashes from the product.. It is also very greasy so I reduced the amount I was using on my face to small pea size - but still - BREAKOUTS.    The new scars I&#x27;d gotten were being made darker and then after a couple of weeks maybe more getting slightly lighter - IT JUST DIDN&#x27;T MAKE SENSE. I felt like I was getting hopeful when they&#x27;d get a little lighter but that&#x27;s were it would stop and then I&#x27;d have new pimples by then from the gel. A VICIOUS CIRCLE and it was depressing me looking at a face full of dark marks.    I used it under my arms for some mild mild darkness and it seemed to stop any sweating I can say that, but as my underarms weren&#x27;t that dark in the first place the lightening was minimal/there wasn&#x27;t much to notice.    Basically I am SO over giving Xtreme Brite the benefit of the doubt. It may work for some I don&#x27;t know but its REALLY not for me, if you are prone to scarring and dark marks, have sensitive skin, or new scars you certainly don&#x27;t want to make darker then PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. You really will get yourself down spending money, time, and effort with Xtreme Brite.    So here is what I have found.. FOR ANY OF YOU LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION TO THE MESS XTREME BRITE HAS LEFT YOUR SKIN IN.    I scoured the internet and came across a site called [...]  They basically provide a duo pack of gel and day lotion/sunscreen to lighten marks on your face and body.  It costs $35 and international shipping was $21 (but its like $5 to ship internally using USPS) - so I pay $56 - £34 sterling.  HONESTLY, it is so worth it, there aren&#x27;t many testimonials on google nor can it be bought on amazon or ebay which put me off buying it at first but I thought &#x27;nothing can be worse than Xtreme Brite&#x27; and just went for it.    I am SO glad I did.. It starts working after about a week of using day and night (it says only at night but I really need my skin to clear up ASAP) so I use a little under my makeup just so it can work during the day. I don&#x27;t use the sunscreen/dark prevention lotion as its very cold in England so hardly sunscreen weather! My skin looks so much better after just a week and feels smooth again, got one or two pimples on the second day but that&#x27;s what I expected.    I am starting to wear less makeup to cover the dark marks after just 10 days and I really really like this product and would recommend it to anyone. It has no smell to it and the gel soaks into the skin quickly. the tub IS small but please don&#x27;t let it put you off as you only need a little - and to be honest for the price you pay it&#x27;s really second to none compared to every other product I have used (BELIEVE ME I&#x27;VE TRIED SO MANY!) so its [...] - the site doesn&#x27;t really give much to go off as it doesn&#x27;t look so fancy etc etc but honestly I couldn&#x27;t rave about this product any more, I feel like I&#x27;m getting my confidence back and I HATED wearing so much makeup to cover what Xtreme brite had done to my face. I feel like I will be able to return to my natural look very soon and go out without wearing makeup again thanks to Blackskin.com    Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed, I wouldn&#x27;t even give Xtreme Brite one cent out of your purse. I WISH I had tried this first, My skin would be perfect by now instead of wasting four months of my life on Xtreme Brite!    I hope this has helped everyone to come to a conclusion on what they wish to do now. I am 20 Years Old with a dark caramel complexion and of mixed heritage if this helps too.    GOOD LUCK! X</li>
    <li> This products is POWERFUL. I&#x27;ve been using for a little over 7 weeks, and my armpits are significantly lighter. I figure by the end of fith tube, I won&#x27;t need to use the Gel any longer. its a long time to see changes but considering that I have  very dark armpits I though that anything would work for me but I&#x27;ve been using every day morning and night and at this time i am very happy with it. Thank you all for all the written reviews it realy helped me to chose the right products.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a cheaper price and so far this is the cheapest one i found one. This product works :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and with my sensitive skin and a few negative review I read, I was very skeptical. I ordered it anyways, I wasnt going to write a review but I love this product!! It does work! I have not started using it on my underarms (my next tube will go for that) I love the results and use it twice a day, no irritation at all and as a black woman I will continue purchasing and share with my family and friends.</li>
    <li> i saw this product on youtube and thought i try it . been using it for a week and im seeing some results not bad</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel foe almost three weeks now, and i have seen a dramatic difference, i have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> i used it on my underarms for about a month and i noticed a difference, made me a little more confident for the summer months but you have to continue using it. im not too familiar with the ingredients so i discontinued use</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the discoloration under my arms and it really worked! The only downside is I had a little irritation from it after about 2 weeks after use. It is scented so I didn&#x27;t have to use a deodorant with it, which was good.</li>
    <li> The whiting gel work for like a week, but once I stopped using it, my underarm went back to the same shade..</li>
    <li> not for African Americans....if you are trying to fade those dark spots...you better off going old school...pure cocoa butter, don&#x27;t recommend to us</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if this product works. I have been using it every night and don&#x27;t really see a difference. Maybe it only works for skin pigmentation that is only a shade darker.</li>
