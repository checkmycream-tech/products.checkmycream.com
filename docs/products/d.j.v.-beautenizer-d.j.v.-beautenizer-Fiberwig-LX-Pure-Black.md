      <li>It&#x27;s nothing like the original formula which I loved.  </li>
      <li>What I got was the original fiberwig, which isn&#x27;t nearly as good to me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product for everyone, but is particularly good for a) people who have sensitive eyes and lashes and b) people who do not want to fuss with their make up - they just want to put it on and forget it.</li>

      <li>The product arrived QUICKLY and in good shape.  </li>
      <li>swimming yet easily removes with just warm water, but I&#x27;ll move on the the newer DJV Beautenizer Volume Lash mascara.     </li>
      <li>; kind of look, so that suited me just fine.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like most mascaras.  </li>
      <li>Love this mascara.  </li>

      <li>From top of the line to the inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was surprised by it. It does make your eyelashes much longer then other products.</li>
    <li> I wish this mascara was more readily available.  Love it to death!  IT truly is like paniting on false lashes.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to trying this mascara with all its fabulous reviews. Now that I have tried it I am not impressed, for the price I see no  real difference in my lashes.  MAYBELLINE, BIG-GREAT LASH FOR $6 gives me better volume and length.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find the version of this mascara that Sephora used to carry, and I think this is it. Please note that the cap is bronze, not silver. I purchased one from another Amazon vendor that had a silver cap, and the quality did not seem to be as good - it got clumpy and dried out quickly. I will be ordering more mascara from this vendor. The thing I like most is the ease of removal, since it comes off in flakes on the cotton ball and does not smear on your skin like other mascaras.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  I actually sleep with it on because I hate removing mascara.  Then, when I take a shower in the morning, it just comes off with warm water and no effort.  I never have raccoon eyes.  The price is too high of course, but it looks like I&#x27;m paying it anyway.</li>
    <li> I got this mascara in a sampler and I keep going back and back to it.  It&#x27;s fun to work with and you can get amazingly long, long lashes. Just keep adding to the tips. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like most mascaras.  It&#x27;s hard to find but worth the effort and price.</li>
    <li> I was upset that this product was no longer available in stores. I was SO HAPPY to be able to purchase it online. I will never use another mascara. It stays on until you take it off, and removal is as simple as warm water-no rubbing or make up remover necessary. The best mascara EVER!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because IMJU was not available.  I used it 3 times and I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s nothing like the original formula which I loved.  This product doesn&#x27;t extend the lashes or hold a curl. When applied your lashes look like sticks. It is a very disappointing product. Save your money.  Look for another product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS. IT WORKS SO WELL! EXTENDS LASHES, MAKES THEM LONGER FULLER AND CURLS THEM. ITS A MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> Great mascara happy to find a dealer who has this product. Is positively waterproof and looks good all day! Good color</li>
    <li> Love it, makes my eyelashes thicker! I ll use this as long as I can . I would recommend this to those who doesn&#x27;t want to keep it applying mascara , it stays and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a sample and honestly its the best mascara i have ever used!!! It really works the way it is described. It extends my lashes when i put it on and also helps to grow your natural lashes. The easy take off is the best part. Just warm water and you can literally pull off the mascara off your eyelashes without damage to your own lases. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Riberwig mascara rolls over the lashes well and coats everything, making my lashes seem three times larger.  almost no clumping- i rarely have that problem, nor do i have the problem of lashes sticking together- if they do they can be straightened out easily and stay that way- i also don&#x27;t have those awful &#x27;mascara crumbs&#x27; on my cheeks if i&#x27;ve been wearing crappy mascara for a long time and it just starts chunking off my lashes- very embarassing -Fiberwig can handle hours in a dance club with a lot of dancing and jumping and humidity and body heat and sweating and all that abuse for a long time- so i don&#x27;t have to keep checking the mirror for destroyed lashes anymore- i am in love with fiberwig!!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing mascara for 30 years and try new ones all the time.  I felt I have to WARN you all that when I simply used the same soap and water I have always used to remove makeup, almost half of my eyelashes fell out with clumps of this mascara on them!  I have NEVER had a problem with any other mascara like this!  IT ISN&#x27;T WORTH TRYING THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried:  Lancome, Estee Lauder, Maybelline, Cover Girl, L&#x27;Oreal, Elizabeth Arden, Urban Decay, Sephora, Clinique, Bare Minerals, Stila, Tarte, Lorac, and at least 20 others with no problems.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous kinds of mascara and I always come back to this!!!  I gives me long lashes when I otherwise have short and clear!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I bought but it is definitely not the same formulation as the DJV Fiberwig mascaras I&#x27;ve bought in Asia or in Japanese supermarkets here in the states. This formulation clumps, falls in my eyes, and when I try to remove it, it takes off my actual lashes with this!! The previous ones I&#x27;ve bought have been amazing but whatever I got through Amazon Marketplace was NOT it. I&#x27;ll be taking my business elsewhere.</li>
    <li> i Love this stuff.  Have moist skin and mascera slides off.  This is for you! Worth every penny it costs!</li>
    <li> Okay, I lost some lashes from cancer so the shorties I have, I need to work with. This is the BEST mascara, I have bought all of the drug store rimmel london and maybeline and covergirl and none of them hardly worked like this. Even voluminous lashes isn&#x27;t this good (fiberwig drug store brand). This mascara makes my lashes touch my eyebrows I love it! Also, it can clump, but with a tiny comb or a pin you can untangle it easily.</li>
    <li> This is definitely NOT a VOLUMIZING mascara, HOWEVER this is my absolutely favorite mascara. I wear this everyday because it makes my lashes look longer and it is so easy to wash off! In addition, I never have to worry about raccoon eyes or accidentally taking out my eyelashes because I was washing off the mascara too rough. Again, this is my favorite and I have been using this mascara for about seven years!!!</li>
    <li> The perfect mascara. It does not smear or flake during the day. My lashes are short and thin and this mascara works wonders. Lengthens and fills in without looking clumpy.</li>
    <li> Best Mascara Ever!!  I Love It!!!</li>
    <li> I originally got this mascara in a kit. I tried lots of mascaras but most tend to leave me with raccoon eyes within a few hours.  This mascara is amazing. Stayed on 12 hours no smudges or flaking. The length was a bonus as well.  Will definitely be purchasing .</li>
    <li> I saw this on Youtube on Lanaindiana&#x27;s Beauty video as she raved about it and ordered it and I&#x27;m glad I did! There&#x27;s No smearing or transfer and it doesn&#x27;t clump. This mascara lengthens and it is beautiful on.</li>
    <li> This item is a great mascara, all three of my girls use this as well as I do too.  When they run out, they come looking for mine.</li>
    <li> used this and loved it and always got it at sephora...they no longer carry it...washes off with soap and water...doesn&#x27;t break eyelashes like so many lash enhancers do</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like false eyelashes in a tube !!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t stay &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; long. Must&#x27;ve been sitting on a shelf for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed with the purchase. The mascara won&#x27;t thickening my lashes like the old ones I bought from the Sephore, it won&#x27;t stay on the lashes and very easy to smear too. It was totally waste of the money.</li>
    <li> The product arrived QUICKLY and in good shape.  However, this I must say...it doesn &#x27;t seem to give m the &amp;#34;false eyelash&amp;#34; look it claims to do.  It is a nice product.  It feels GREAT on...like its not even on.  It stays put all day and comes off so easily at night.  But, I&#x27;ve gotten the same look with much less expensive mascara from the drugstore.  I&#x27;m disappointed but not enough so to send it back.  BTW, I have decent enough lashes to feel I can make a good comparison.</li>
    <li> In recent years (ok -- as I get older :-)  ) I really need to use a good under-eye moisturizer.   Unfortunately, by mid-afternoon that meant dark smudges under the eye.  I must have gone through 10 under-eye moisturizers and a dozen mascaras from the high-end to the low and still had the problem.  A saleswoman at Sephora recommended d.j.v. and I bought it.  Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not only does it make for full lashes but it stays in place.  I keep waiting to find some disadvantage to it but none so far.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve been able to keep from smudging in years and lasts all day.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t form hard clumps and stays put really well, but sometimes &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; can drop off. Cleans off with water, but does take a bit of effort to fully remove. It doesn&#x27;t really thicken the eyelashes, but does darken and extend. This is the most expensive mascara I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but so far I think it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> seriously, i could sleep in it and i wouldn&#x27;t get raccoon eyes. i wish sephora still carried it. YAY for amazon!  PS.  the first time you take it off (i use ALMAY eye makeup remover pads) you will think that your eyelashes are falling off -- that is NOT your lashes -- its just that the mascara comes off in little flakes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fiberwig for years.  This is my HG mascara for daily wear.  It is what I wear every day to the office where I work.  It makes my lashes look longer, darker, and fuller without looking overly dramatic.  The best thing is that it wears all day with ZERO smudging.  As someone who has long suffered from &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;, I really appreciate the tubing qualities that Fiberwig has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also incredibly easy to remove.  Because I wear it every day, a mascara that is damaging or causes lash loss is a no-go.  Fiberwig is gentle on my lashes and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for everyone, but is particularly good for a) people who have sensitive eyes and lashes and b) people who do not want to fuss with their make up - they just want to put it on and forget it.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I am tired of my mascara flaking by the end of my workday. The advertisement claimed that it would never flake, went on smooth; no lumping. Both are very false! I used it for about 3 days and had more than enough of it. I would not reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> Your lashes will look longer than you could ever imagine. Really worth the money and you will never use any other brand.</li>
    <li> Best tubing mascara hands down!  Will never buy another brand!  Amazing length and washes off so clean and easily.  Really makes my eyes pop.</li>
    <li> This is not worth buying.  When I  opened, the wand was just a glob of mascara.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using fiberwig mascara for several years now, and it is still my favorite.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of mascara, but nothing comes close to this one.  It makes my lashes look long and thick, but not clumpy.  I also like that this mascara does not smudge at all.  It is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> i used fiberwig from sephora all the time and found this as a replacement. i have to give 4 stars as it&#x27;s not exactly the same formula but it&#x27;s good enough that i would buy again!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best! This mascara makes your lashes looooong with no clumping, no flaking, and no smudging. Plus, it comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
    <li> I can sleep in this mascara and it won&#x27;t rub off. It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t do that to me. It also comes off easily with regular face wash, you don&#x27;t have to use waterproof mascara remover.</li>
    <li> It does stay on without smudging, or leaving that raccoon look, but the tube doesn&#x27;t last long before it starts clumping. A bit overpriced for what you get.</li>
    <li> After many years trying to find the perfect mascara, I finally found this at Sephora (who no longer carries it...??). It&#x27;s the only mascara in the world that does not give me raccoon eyes after hours of wear. It stays on all day. It only slight flakes off but the flakes can be easily brushed away whereas other mascaras will leave a smudgy mark, causing the raccoon eyes. It also gets better as the bottle ages, then the mascara goes on a little more dry, making my eyelashes look thicker and longer. I was so devastated to find out that Sephora no longer carries it, but was overjoyed when I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever. Applies nicely and it&#x27;s also easy to take off. The fibers in the mascara make your lashes SO long. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. Used to by it at Sephora, they stopped carrying it. I&#x27;ve tried the 2 step type but this is much much better and does my clump like the ones with fibers in a seperate tube.</li>
    <li> It was ok ...the one I got from Sephora has the extension in the mascara so my lashes were longer and that&#x27;s what I thought I was getting but sadly no. I will not be buying more.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. I used to buy it from Sephora. I use it as a first layer and then use my regular mascara on top of it. When my husband and I were first dating, I remember him asking, &amp;#34;Are your eyelashes real?&amp;#34; Ha! This really adds length without clumping. I was also pleased to receive 2 tubes of mascara as I was excpecting only one! Bonus!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I really like this mascara.  It seems to be pretty good when wearing it, however when you go to remove it, it seems like all of your lashes are coming out.  It&#x27;s the little fibers that I&#x27;m seeing, however it looks really scarey and there was a few of mine own lashes coming out in the mix as well.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that doesnt&#x27; give me raccoon eyes! And it washes off easily....</li>
    <li> Is good product for price.  Takes several layers to get length and then have to use other mascara to finish out.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! Doesn&#x27;t leave residue throughout the day or after eye moisturizer. Other waterproof brands would leave marks under my eyes. I was always wiping it off. Very thankful for this and it&#x27;s easy to remove. It really extends my lashes.</li>
    <li> Kind of like the one I used to buy in the states but it didn&#x27;t last as long, so not sure if the chemical makeup is different outside the US or not?  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> This is not the product pictured, a red  tube with a cooper colored top and the text &amp;#34;Paint-On False Lashes&amp;#34; is what I wanted. The product  pictured is what I used to purchase at Sephora, no longer available, and what I was trying to buy on Amazon and bought based on the product picture BUT it is not the same!</li>
    <li> Nice mascara.  Like it because it isn&#x27;t clumpy or heavy.  Haven&#x27;t found that it actually comes off with water though.</li>
    <li> TONS of the fibers ended up in my eyes regardless of how carefully I applied the mascara. Seemed too heavy and wet, my lashes didn&#x27;t hold a curl at all. The color was glossy and very black, but not worth money or eye irritation.</li>
    <li> The good news even though discontinued in stores Amazon still has djv and it is still wonderful. Using tubular technology there is no smudging. I was very disappointed when retail stores discontinued it. I have converted many of my friends to this mascara. It was nice to find a prompt vendor.</li>
    <li> It was thick and clumpy right from the start. Didn&#x27;t live up to its claims for me. Would never recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years and I love that it doesn&#x27;t smear or flake off even with exercise.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this mascara for years now, it gives the best coverage and never runs. I&#x27;ve tried others: from Covergirl to Dior to Chanel, and nothing comes close. I used to buy this at Sephora but for whatever reason, they haven&#x27;t been stocking it. Fortunately Amazon does!</li>
    <li> I work in the restaurant biz so I&#x27;m always sweating and seems I always have raccoon eyes! At the recommendation of a Sephora associate, I tried this product. Unfortunately, Sephora no longer carries it, so i turned to the Internet. This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered. My order is always expedited quickly and it&#x27;s always correct! This product gives you long, illustrious lashes, and comes off with warm soap and water - no make-up remover and definitely no raccoon eyes. I challenge you to find a better product. I don&#x27;t think one exists...</li>
    <li> Best mascara, hands down. Stays put until you want to remove it. Coats the lashes and comes off clean with no raccoon eyes or scrubbing. To remove, wet lashes with water, wait about 15 - 20 seconds, close eyes and and sweep lashes with your forefingers. The mascara will come off clean and intact.</li>
    <li> B/c of the waterproof formula that doesnt dissolve, I can leave it on for a couple days.  It doesn&#x27;t leave black smudges &amp; I can wear it in the shower or pool if it doesn&#x27;t get super wet.  That is when the tubes start to slide off.  I don&#x27;t even need eye makeup remover--I just get them super wet &amp; slide the tubes off my lashes.  It&#x27;s pretty cool!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It&#x27;s so good at lengthening my lashes. And my lashes don&#x27;t really bunch up if I watch the amount that I&#x27;m applying at a time.</li>
    <li> I used this mascara for years and I always purchased mine from Sephora until they stopped carrying it.  What I received in the mail is not at all like my tube of Fiberwig I bought from Sephora, both in appearance and formula.  It is my understanding that the name was changed from Imju Fiberwig to d.j.v. beautenizer Fiberwig LX and the brush was changed from a straight brush with a silver cap to a copper cap with a curved brush a couple of years ago.  If the formula was changed, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference because the mascara performed as it always did.  The tube I received from this seller was not like either of the two versions of Fiberwig.  I don&#x27;t know if it is a knock-off or a different version because it is not the same? The tube I received had the new curved brush with the old silver cap and it is labeled as d.j.v. Fiberwig. My old tube from Sephora is labeled d.j.v. beautenizer Fiberwig XL. The formula is nothing like the Fiberwig mascara I have used all these years and it did not work for me at all.  If you bought your Fiberwig from Sephora, don&#x27;t buy this version.</li>
    <li> I love tubing mascara like Fiberwig &amp; it&#x27;s preferrably the only type of mascara I like to wear.     I used the original Fiberwig when it came out on the market, as well as other brands that have popped up since then, &amp; now I bought the new DJV Beautenizer, but am not really a fan of it.     I will continue to use it as I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge, stays on while swimming yet easily removes with just warm water, but I&#x27;ll move on the the newer DJV Beautenizer Volume Lash mascara.     This mascara lengthens (which I don&#x27;t really need right now) but doesn&#x27;t plump up or volumize lashes (which I really need). The curved brush is terribly awkward to use &amp; I don&#x27;t like it. I prefer a traditional straight mascara brush.     I give credit to Fiberwig for its tubing technology, but I&#x27;ll move on from this item. There are other options available (albeit very few).</li>
    <li> I have been using fiber wig for several years. I used to buy it at Sephora and when they stopped carrying it I panicked. Thank goodness Amazon has it. This mascara goes on so great and really lengthens. It&#x27;s the only mascara that holds the curl after I use the eyelash curler. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Good mascara. I have a tendency to raccoon with my eye makeup. This never does. They used to sell at Sephora but stopped for some reason. It&#x27;s not the original though.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really seem different than any other mascara</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It is the only mascara I have found that doesn&#x27;t flake or lead to &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;. It lasts all day, and washes off easily with water. It lives up to its claim of lengthening lashes. It can clump, so practice application before you write it off.</li>
    <li> I have used this kind of mascara for years, I originally purchased it at Sephora. I&#x27;m not sure if this is even the same exact one, because the packaging and even the mascara itself looks very different, but it has the same name. Anyhow, I went to buy it from Sephora a few months ago and the saleswoman informed me that they are no longer carrying it! Not sure why but it seems as though Sephora is carrying less and less of my products! I went to amazon.com and this is what popped up! It seems to be working as well as the original one from sephora, it definitely gives you a TON of length. My lashes are naturally long but now they are just insane. It DOES NOT however, give your lashes any thickness. I&#x27;m not big on that so I don&#x27;t mind but it definitely works as a lengthening mascara!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed when Sephora stopped carrying this mascara because it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Luckily I was still able to get it here on Amazon. Hope it remains available for a long time. It has a great lash-building quality.. you can apply a little for a natural look or keep applying for a heavy dramatic look. A+</li>
    <li> I was expecting a lot more from this mascara.  Did not make my eye lashes look big or full.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Another product I can&#x27;t get enough of! No panda eyes. Longer lashes. Lasts all day. Can&#x27;t find a comparable product here in Australia so am very happy can find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, I love it!!!! The only other mascara that&#x27;s come close to it has been unstoppable by may belling, and the discontinued that one too!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST mascara I have ever used.  I know some people (on other sites I have reviewed) have given it poor reviews but it is like many other things in life, you have to work with it a little bit to see how it best performs for you.  I was not sure about it when I tried it many years ago at the suggestion of a Sephora employee but they have a no questions asked return policy so I thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; and gave it a whirl.  It does not do wonders for volume but that is not my concern, I am interested in length as I have little stubby eyelashes.  First, I curl my lashes and apply the first coat allowing it to dry to maintain the curl, then I add as many coats as I want to give my eyelashes full length and more volume.  It literally can appear as if I have false eyelashes if I add enough coats.  I also LOVE the removal process, just some warm water and minor pressure and POOF, off they come.  Believe me ladies, I am a beauty JUNKIE, I have tried almost every mascara out there and this stays put, even in the Florida heat and humidity without pulling all my eyelashes out.  I am not sure if they aren&#x27;t producing this any longer but Sephora no longer carries it so I will have to order it online as long as it is available.  DJV Beautenizer, I implore you, PLEASE do NOT stop making this mascara!  ;)</li>
    <li> So pleased to find this mascara available on Amazon!  The store where I normally purchase is not carrying it anymore.  After trying numerous mascaras over the years, finally found this one which has worked well for me.  I have extremely oily skin and this one doesn&#x27;t wear off or smudge as all the others have.  It is as close to &#x27;oil-proof&#x27; as I have found so far.  It also rarely clumps unlike all the others that supposedly were &#x27;clump-free&#x27;.  Better than many waterproof mascaras I have tried!  Love that it washes off easily as well.  BY the way, this is Robert&#x27;s wife writing this review :)</li>
    <li> I like this mascara because it comes off with soap and water and doesn&#x27;t leave any black under my eyes.</li>
    <li> yes, this mascara doesn&#x27;t flake, smear or run. but, other than that i did not see any increase in either length or volume. i would not reorder or recommend.</li>
    <li> I love how my eyes look after I use it just once my eyes look fuller bigger and brighter!</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like the curved brush.  My daughter did so I gave it to her.  It was advertised in another magazine as creating a tube to cover each lash.  Seemed like just regular mascara to me.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this mascara before and loved it. This tube is a little messy though. The tube doesn&#x27;t have enough friction for the wand to come out with a reasonable amount of mascara. Too much comes out and it&#x27;s a bit clumpy.</li>
    <li> This mascara makes my lashes look like long, skinny twigs. I looked in the mirror this morning and realized that it looked like I didn&#x27;t even put mascara on even though I put on two coats. I had to run to the drugstore to buy a mascara to coat over it. For the price, I do not want to use two mascaras in order to have my desired effect. I do not recommend this mascara.</li>
    <li> Love how it doesn&#x27;t clump and cleans off with just water, but doesn&#x27;t run if it gets wet.  I prefer the straight brush though.</li>
    <li> This mascara has got to be my favorite product ever. The worlds best mascara in my opinion. I have two tubes of this and will definitely re-purchase! it coats yours lashes perfectly and doesn&#x27;t clump!! I love it because its easy to layer without having it look like there are droplets of black goop on your lashes! absolutely amazing!! Definitely worth the $22</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!!!! I&#x27;m done trying new mascara!!! No smudging, smearing, easy to wash off with warm water, and makes my lashes look long and Amazing!!! Wow!!! Can&#x27;t say enough about it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this item i only do one application and it lasts the whole day...and its soft to the touch...will be my go to...:)</li>
    <li> I am IN LOVE! I have short, blonde eyelashes. This mascara actually does what it says it will, gives super great length and you can build it up for dramatic lashes with no clumping. The trick is to not let it dry between coats, so doing one eye at a time is best. This does not give much volume, so I just put a final coat of a different mascara for volume. It also stays put until you take it off and it&#x27;s very easy to remove if you follow the instructions. Totally worth every penny and I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I love this.  It never smudge.  Only mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge on me.  Easy to remove too.  Wish they have a waterproof version too.</li>
    <li> I use this Fiberwig for one reason alone: it. does. not. smudge. Some girls can wear mascara without it giving off dark smudges around their eyes. Sadly, not me. Rain, exercise, laugh, smile, blink - I look like a raccoon in half an hour. Not a lot, but enough to have to check my make-up, wipe the offending spots away, ruin my eye make up doing so, and repeating every half hour rubs the skin under my eyes sore/red. So - for all the girls whose lashes tend to touch the skin under their eyes when they laugh, blink, cry, dance, exercise and enjoy life - Fiberwig will stay on your lashes, not on your skin. Rain? Cold water? Swimming? No problem, it stays on. Warm water takes it off in a flash, no rubbing or special eye make-up removers needed. I never used lots of make up, but I LOVE my mascara and I&#x27;ve tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;Fiberwig makes my lashes longer (just keep going, you can build them as long as you like), curls them a bit, and makes them thicker. It totally makes my eyes look awake and perky. Yet - after all the raving, let&#x27;s be truthful: this mascara cannot do what a DiorShow does, or Lancome&#x27;s super mascaras. If your eyes don&#x27;t smudge, do go with them (though their waterproof stuff takes a looooot of rubbing and special stuff to come off, ouch). If your eyes smudge easily and you want to look good (well, better!) then Fiberwig&#x27;s your new thing maybe?&lt;br /&gt;Oh one more thing: my eyes are super sensitive, and I can barely wear eye shadow without my skin acting up the next morning. I&amp;#34;ve worn Clinique, Lancome, Dior, Loreal, etc. etc. Fiberwig is perfectly fine for my eyes I can actually use it every day. Super!&lt;br /&gt;There are a few reviews out there who say the product is different from what they used to buy (and why oh why did Sephora stop carrying this product?!) I have no idea about that. I just bought another tube and the goop is good as usual. The one other thing is that it does dry out relatively quickly. In spite of those minus points, Fiberwig gives mea second lease to lashes/life/make up and therefore it&#x27;s 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> Almost every mascara I have ever purchased has left dark smudges under my eyes by the end of the day. Since I discovered d.j.v. beautenizer Fiberwig, raccoon eyes are a thing of the past! Fiberwig goes on smoothly, without clumping, and is easily removed with warm water. Hands down, the best lengthening mascara I have ever owned. I hope that Amazon continues to keep it in stock (it&#x27;s been discontinued at Sephora).</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING!!!  It really lengthens and doesn&#x27;t clump.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> I love it it&#x27;s amazing mascara!</li>
    <li> guess they changed the formula...it seems much less effective than the original ..not the dramatic long lashes i remember probably 5 years ago when i made my first purchase at Sephora.(they don&#x27;t even sell it anymore). Like that it comes off with warm water in&lt;br /&gt;just about a single piece  and does not smear like other mascaras. Its just okay..</li>
    <li> very best mascara in the world!! Since I have found this product I will never go back to any other mascera</li>
    <li> I LOVE the fiberwig LX mascara, which is what I thought I was ordering, because that&#x27;s what the listing said. What I got was the original fiberwig, which isn&#x27;t nearly as good to me. Won&#x27;t be ordering from that seller again because I want to be sure what product I&#x27;ll get. I was very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> third time I have bought it. Will not use any other mascara!!! LOVE this product! Ordering more for my daughters</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I found it a few years ago at Sephora but they stopped selling it so I switched to buying it online. I like the fact that it coats the lashes and doesn&#x27;t come off or smear, even when I swim!!</li>
    <li> I am so dissappointed in this product.  It was very expensive and isn&#x27;t any better than Cover Girl or any other reasonably priced mascara.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The picture shown is not what you get in the mail. You will receive a Chinese version in a similar bottle.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara!  It really lengthens my lashes and is truly buildable so you can customize your results. Even after a long day and with oily skin, this mascara does not clump or smudge. No raccoon eyes for me!  I also love that it can be easily removed with just soap and water. No need for eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I was sad when sephora took this product off the shelves, but I&#x27;m so happy that it is carried on amazon. It is simply the best. The fiberwigs make your lashes look much longer, but still natural, and  once it&#x27;s dry, it doesn&#x27;t drip down throughout the day and make you look like a racoon. The best part is washing it off, the fiberwigs just come right off with water, so no need to scrub your eyes and potentially thin our your natural eyelashes. 100% recommend.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this, I was amazed. I have tried other mascaras with fibers before, but this is by far the best. It lengthens so well and the effect is so natural-looking and beautiful. I also love that it conditions my lashes so they won&#x27;t break off with continued usage. It holds a curl very well, all day actually, which is amazing since I have thick, straight lashes. Another plus is that it does not smudge during the day, and yet comes off with warm water. Overall, this is a wonderful mascara. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t offer much volume at all, which is why I recommend it for those who want a natural look, as though they&#x27;re not wearing mascara at all and yet have gorgeously long lashes. I prefer a bit of volume, which is why I probably will not repurchase this and will instead opt for Fairydrops mascara (film type from japan), which I love.</li>
    <li> Fiber Wig definitely gives you the extra length you are looking for.  I also love that it is water resistant but washes off easily with just soap and water.  My only complaint is that it seems to get clumpy faster than regular mascara so you have to buy it more often.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Unfortunately despite the photo and the description I didn&#x27;t receive the LX.  I received only the djv beautenizer (at the $22 price of the LX.)  Both the regular and the LX are great products.  But I wanted (and paid for) the LX.  Amazon was great about refunding my money.  I&#x27;m so sad I can&#x27;t get this amazing mascara.</li>
    <li> This product is not as advertised, other reviewers seemed to have the same issue. It flakes and gets into my eyes and caused irritation and massive tearing because it didn&#x27;t stay on my lashes. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that I use. There are a lot of brands now that offer mascaras that add fibers to lengthen lashes, however I have found this formula to be light and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my lashes. It also comes off easily with warm water alone. Sephora doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore, and this is one of the few sites that still offer this Japanese mascara. I don&#x27;t like the look of fake lashes because it&#x27;s often too dramatic; this product extends your lashes enough and it looks natural.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great love it can&#x27;t find it anywhere any more!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This was a huge waste of money. I had not tried the Fiber wig product that everyone raved about and so I can&#x27;t compare it. But it is definitely not worth $22.</li>
    <li> Recently ordered and I like the product a lot. No racoon eyes, and very easy to wash off.</li>
    <li> When I first broght this product it was recommended by a my freind who is a makeup artist.  I was looking for a waterproof mascara that actually worked.  He also knew that I am into organics and said it was very safe and not even tears would make it come off.  To my surprise not only was it water proof but smudge proof. I tend to rub my eyes often and have bad allergies. NO more racoon eyes. I also now have onger sexy lashes.  I was very amazed, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It took me a little while to decide what I thought about this.  First off, I have slightly oily skin around my eyes, which means pretty much everything smudges somewhat.  Until I discovered tubing mascaras, and I was hooked.  Blinc is my typical choice, but I love length so I&#x27;ve always wanted to try Fiberwig, because I heard such rave reviews.  I&#x27;ve worn it consistently for several days before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiberwig feels like kind of a dry formula compared to Blinc, which is very wet.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it.  It seemed a little dry and didn&#x27;t add much oomph in the first sweep, however it applied multiple coats very smoothly and easily.  With two coats it looked very nice.  I feel it doesn&#x27;t add much volume, but I tend towards the &amp;#34;natural but better&amp;#34; kind of look, so that suited me just fine.  I did have to be a little careful, but it was easy to prevent clumps, and defined my lashes surprisingly well.  After two coats, I had a lovely fringe of well-defined, long lashes.  I didn&#x27;t even have to use my lash comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It held curl for most of the day, though it was sagging somewhat by midday.  The overall look and length held up quite well all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, despite wearing fairly well, it does smudge/flake a little.  I think what&#x27;s actually happening, is that I have enough length that as my lashes bump up against my lids throughout the day, it&#x27;s brushing off some of the teeny little fibers that are in the mascara, and it leaves those sitting on my skin.  They&#x27;re very easy to remove (no real smudge-smudges), but at the end of the day, I do not want to have to keep checking my mascara for smudgies.  To me, that was the whole reason to pursue tubing mascaras in the first place, so I will be going back to my trusty Blinc.  The Fiberwig was also not -quite- as forgiving about say, rubbing your eye, or tears, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your eyelids do not get oily at all, it might hold up better.  I thought the Fiberwig did create a very pretty look, so if you love length and definition (and have a little patience) I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a shot, but be aware that it can flake depending on your eye shape/skin type.e a very pretty look, so if you love length and definition (and have a little patience) I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a shot, but be aware that it can flake depending on your eye shape/skin type.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  Started wearing it approximately 3 years ago for my daughter&#x27;s wedding and it doesn&#x27;t smudge, flake off in my contacts and makes my short lashes look longer.  Lately it has become hard to find so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  Try this as you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY brands of mascara during my lifetime. From top of the line to the inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE Fiberwig because it is &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and very easy to apply. The tiny fibers enables the lash to get the longest,&lt;br /&gt;natural look around. Many brands are &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and very difficult, if not impossible,to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that I can continue to purchase this brand online. The store that I usually purchased it no longer carries this&lt;br /&gt;mascara. I am sure that many women out there love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Coats every lash, a good but subtle mascara (the thick stuff goes on AFTER this base coat)</li>
</ol>
