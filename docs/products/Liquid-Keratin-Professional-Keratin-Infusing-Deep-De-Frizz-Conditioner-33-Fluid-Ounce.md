      <li>I love this product i have very curly hair and this worked.</li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Love and works great!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft and has so helped with summer frizz.</li>
      <li>I usually do not take the time to review products, only the exceptional ones.  </li>
      <li>I use the shampoo first.  </li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s a deep conditioner as well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>Makes hair smooth and frizz-free... feels soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, just different....</li>
      <li>I have soft, semi curly hair that frizzes on the top when the weather is humid, and I move a lot with work to very humid areas where my frizz goes wild.</li>
      <li>Always make sure you blow dry your hair all the way.  </li>
      <li>I have long, color treated curly hair, which is so much more relaxed thanks to this product.  </li>
      <li>I use this with the Liquid Keratin shampoo and it really does help.  </li>
      <li>My hairdresser gave me a tip that really works too.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner really soothes irritated skin.  </li>
      <li>I love it, the treatment has healed my hair in other words</li>
      <li>My hair is now soft, shiny and very pleasing to run fingers through!</li>
      <li>If you leave any moisture your hair it will frizz later, even if it looks smooth right after you flat iron it.  </li>
      <li>I have used everything to tame the frizz of the new hair on top of my head and short from saloon keratin treatments nothing worked until i started using this in combination of a light serum and it works.</li>
      <li>, i prefer a wash and go natural look and this product has really transformed my hair and even without the keratin treatment.</li>
      <li>For now I will stick with the conditioner and find a new shampoo.</li>
      <li>My husband hates it and doesnt even wanna come near me after ive shampooed my hair with this thing! :</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, frizz-free IN HUMIDITY!  </li>
      <li>talk about smooth and shine, not a single snarl or struggle to brush thru when wet.</li>
      <li>This is the only thing I tried so far that really tamed the beast on my head.</li>
      <li>It has done so much not only for my hair but for my scalp ,mind you  </li>
      <li>Although this doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair, it does decrease the frizz and leaves my hair soft and easier to detangle.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft and hydrated as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is my second bottle of conditioner, and I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>My color stays true, it does not weigh down hair and my hair has body.  </li>
      <li>I cannot really comment on the defrizz aspect, as I live in a very dry climate so I do not have that problem.</li>
      <li>I have several high end conditioners, but I am going to stick with this one for now.</li>
      <li>My hair is so much softer with this conditioner, and has less frizz, even on days with high humidity.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair that is also thin AND color-treated.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t think it would be that good.  I have soft, semi curly hair that frizzes on the top when the weather is humid, and I move a lot with work to very humid areas where my frizz goes wild. I have used everything to tame the frizz of the new hair on top of my head and short from saloon keratin treatments nothing worked until i started using this in combination of a light serum and it works. You need to bare in mind that i don&#x27;t dry or flat iron my hair, i prefer a wash and go natural look and this product has really transformed my hair and even without the keratin treatment.</li>

    <li> I just wrote a review on the shampoo, and I have only the BEST things to say about this product.  My hair is soft, frizz-free IN HUMIDITY!  I can air dry it and it doesn&#x27;t look like a crazy frizz ball.  I have long, color treated curly hair, which is so much more relaxed thanks to this product.  LOVE IT!!!  Replaces salon keratin treatments for me! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every conditioner out there - from low cost to salon brand - and this is by far the best conditioner I have ever used. I love that it&#x27;s a deep conditioner as well. Just leave it on for 10-15 minutes, for deep conditioning, or 5 for regular. Nothing else makes my hair as manageable or agreeable as Liquid Keratin does. I cannot really comment on the defrizz aspect, as I live in a very dry climate so I do not have that problem. I would certainly not pay this much for a bottle of conditioner if it was not worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I have a a VERY thick mane, wavy and extremely frizzy. This is the only thing I tried so far that really tamed the beast on my head. My hair is now soft, shiny and very pleasing to run fingers through! And this is only from my second use. I&#x27;m amazed why this is not as viral as it should be.</li>
    <li> Love the conditioner! Makes hair smooth and frizz-free... feels soft and manageable.  FYI, the shampoo of this product is not sulfate free, so if you are thinking of getting both you should know that.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is my second bottle of conditioner, and I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner!  I use the shampoo first.  I have fine frizzy color treated hair.  My color stays true, it does not weigh down hair and my hair has body.  After I flat iron my hair the frizz stays away.  Even on our most humid days of 78% - 85% humidity.  In the rain I cover my hair outside with a hood and inside there is no frizz.  My hairdresser gave me a tip that really works too.  Always make sure you blow dry your hair all the way.  If you leave any moisture your hair it will frizz later, even if it looks smooth right after you flat iron it.  This has helped a lot too!  This conditioner really soothes irritated skin.  For kicks I put it on my razor burned under arms, the new razor really hurt my very sensitive skin, and it healed them in one day, crazy I know but it worked!  Skin is skin right!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Works like a charm.  My hair is so much softer with this conditioner, and has less frizz, even on days with high humidity. I paired it with the LQ de-frizz shampoo. Great new smell. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love and works great!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft and has so helped with summer frizz.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff, fast delivery.</li>

    <li> I have fine color treated hair and well water. Unloved the smell and my hair turns out awesome each and every time I use this duo.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner and the only one that makes my hair feel lustrous after a terrible perm. What it does to combat the good is that it makes my hair smell like rotten egg yolks! My husband hates it and doesnt even wanna come near me after ive shampooed my hair with this thing! :P&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt discourage me from using it and spraying some nice smelling body mist</li>
    <li> Helps decrease the frizz in my curly/wavy hair.  I have had keratin treatments in my hair, which was getting costly. Although this doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair, it does decrease the frizz and leaves my hair soft and easier to detangle.  It has a pleasant smell. Please note: the Liquid Keratin Shampoo is not sulfate-free which is odd to me since sulfate-free products are recommended for keratin treated hair.  Also, the shampoo does not smell that great. I hope they change the formulation so that I can use both the shampoo and conditioner together. For now I will stick with the conditioner and find a new shampoo.</li>
    <li> Get it. It&#x27;s amazing.  I have baby fine hair that is also thin AND color-treated.  Since I started using this (with the shampoo), each time I get a trim I have less and less damage on my ends - which means I have to have less and less trimmed every time. I like this even better than Kerastase.</li>
    <li> GREAT HAIR PRODUCT. It has done so much not only for my hair but for my scalp ,mind you  I&#x27;m hella black with nappy 12Yrs a slave kind of hair . I will be buying it again</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used. It is AWESOME!!! i HAVE GIVEN THIS AS A gift and everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> I try every shampoo and conditioner out there. same day I bought this I bought the alterna caviar , this was cheaper and way better, and I absolutely love it. talk about smooth and shine, not a single snarl or struggle to brush thru when wet. I have long very thin but wavy brittle easily breakable hair. i don&#x27;t think any pieces broke and that is a miracle. love this stuff and jellua shampoo and conditioner will be the only two i will every buy</li>
    <li> I love this product i have very curly hair and this worked. it detangled my hair easily and made it soft, i also use the leave in conditioner works great also will buy more!</li>
    <li> I have dry/frizzy/fine hair. This conditioner adds moisture to my hair without weighing it down and cuts the frizz down about 75-90%. I love it, I just hate to pay this much for conditioner.  I&#x27;ve used this with and without the liquid keratin shampoo, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference. So, I have found that using Suave shampoo with this conditioner works just as well. I also like the leave in spray liquid keratin conditioner.  The only thing I would change about this product is the smell. It&#x27;s not horrible, just different.... Also, the liquid keratin web site sells this for 44-59 depending on what sales they have. I have always found it cheaper on ebay and amazon.</li>
    <li> Great highly recommended</li>
    <li> I use this with the Liquid Keratin shampoo and it really does help.  I also use the leave in conditioner when the weather is more damp.  Give it a try if you fight frizz.</li>
    <li> it made my hair feel waxy and look frizzy. It does smell good. i probably wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> My husband can attest, I have tried every brand of shampoo/conditioner out there.  I don&#x27;t want to think about how much $$$ I spent on all of them, and some so disappointing, never even finished the bottle.  This Liquid Keratin ~ which I cannot find in stores, has met and exceeded my expectations.  My hair is unruly and wavy and difficult to style.  The Liquid Keratin products have worked very well for me, even cutting my styling time almost in half.  My pilates instructor even asked me what I did to my hair, as she commented on how noticeably shinier it looked.  I usually do not take the time to review products, only the exceptional ones.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I have several high end conditioners, but I am going to stick with this one for now. Works well.</li>
