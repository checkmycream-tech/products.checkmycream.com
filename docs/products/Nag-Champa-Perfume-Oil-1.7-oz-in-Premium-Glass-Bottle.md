      <li>Scentsational Shoppe NJ inc has nailed this incredible essential oil fragrance.</li>
      <li>I use it in a diffuser, just 4-6 drops in water is all it takes to have your home smelling incredible for several hours.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s lots of scented oils that claim to be nag champa smell but are not quite there--they smell fine, it&#x27;s just not nag champa.  </li>
      <li>Smells fantastic, lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Too much alcohol!!!</li>
      <li>This brand of it is by far the best smelling I have found in a long time.</li>
      <li>The perfume is good but the scent is a personal preference.</li>
      <li>I use it every day and the bottle is still completely full.  </li>
      <li>you for caring enough to create a True Nag Champa scent and not to skimp on the good stuff when mixing it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also pretty strong</li>
      <li>I agree it starts out strong and then very quickly mellows out, but the soft fragrance remains with you until you shower.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance of this oil is earthy and sophisticated and will be my new &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>It smells exactly like Nag Champa!</li>
      <li>Beautiful, very rich sweet true perfume version of Nag Champa, romantic and mysterious yet familiar and youthful with a solid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Heavy on the frangipani which is great if you&#x27;re into floral scents.  </li>
      <li>worth the money.</li>
      <li>Powerful but not over bearing.</li>
      <li>This one smells right.  </li>
      <li>There was an undertone scent which just turned me right off it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pleasant to wear and a little dab will definitely do ya.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Very strong when you first put it on, and can be a bit overwhelming at first, but within the hour it mellows out and smells just like the incense, and long lasting.....</li>
      <li>This is my first experience with Nag Champa.  </li>
      <li>exactly what i wanted</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this purchase, not only will I be buying more NC, I will be buying other scented oils they offer as well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t say a word; however, I was amazed how much it smells just like Nag Champa.</li>
      <li>so much I ordered 4.</li>
      <li>For Nag fans, this stuff is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>Better than any other companies nag champa oils.</li>
      <li>Definitely smells more like a perfume scent than an essential oil blend.  </li>
      <li>Pretty big bottle with a pretty decent price</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to anyone who enjoys nag champa incense.</li>
      <li>Really really strong - unlike the other bottles of perfume oil they sell.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and the amount you get is fairly substantial.</li>
      <li>it is calming and mesmerizing st the same time.</li>
      <li>Comes in a pretty blue pouch too!  </li>
      <li>I would just suggest looking at other products if you&#x27;re seeking a true nag champa oil blend.</li>
      <li>BUT, I was pleasantly surprised with this oil.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s true - a little goes a LONG way.  </li>

    <li> AMAZING product!  Perfect smell, just like the incense!  This will stay all day too. I get complements all day when i wear this. Comes in a pretty blue pouch too!  Finally found my scent!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, rich n sweet rather than perfumy like most. Pretty big bottle with a pretty decent price, i will likely be a return customer.</li>
    <li> Potent!  Intoxicating!</li>
    <li> Love love love this oil. Smells just like nag champa. Better than any other companies nag champa oils. This one&#x27;s organic</li>
    <li> Definitely smells more like a perfume scent than an essential oil blend.  This is not your typical nag champa sandalwood/frangipani blend.  Heavy on the frangipani which is great if you&#x27;re into floral scents.  It&#x27;s very pleasant to wear and a little dab will definitely do ya.  I would just suggest looking at other products if you&#x27;re seeking a true nag champa oil blend.</li>
    <li> It was perfume water down almost pee yellow not oil like it was described. I have never been allergic to Nag Champa oil and this one makes my skin burn! Too much alcohol!!!</li>
    <li> strong!! I mix with another oil.</li>
    <li> I was nervous this wouldn&#x27;t smell like the scent I remembered. Spot on! I only have to use a dab in the morning and I still get comments/compliments later in the day. Love love love it. I think this bottle will last a while because literally &amp;#34;a little dab will so ya&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> For Nag fans, this stuff is the real deal.  Some of the best smelling we have ever had.  Excellent deal for the amount you get.</li>

I will definitely buy again when I run low.</li>
    <li> It smells exactly like Nag Champa!</li>
    <li> Perfect Nag Champa scent!</li>
    <li> This is a fragrance that I personally do not like. There was an undertone scent which just turned me right off it. The perfume is good but the scent is a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I found this perfume. I was in a meeting at work while wearing it and someone asked where the smell of incense was coming from. LOLOL I didn&#x27;t say a word; however, I was amazed how much it smells just like Nag Champa. A little bit goes a long way and it&#x27;s quite a big bottle. It&#x27;s going to last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Very nice &#x27;Meditative&#x27; scent.  And it&#x27;s true - a little goes a LONG way.  Plan to order again.. if I EVER run out!</li>
    <li> rich fragrance! worth the money.</li>
    <li> The product arrived during the time window given.  It does smell like the nag champa incense, but sweeter.  It&#x27;s definitely more suited for women, even though it&#x27;s billed as unisex.  I gave it to my mom.  Good product for women, men should look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> It may burn for a couple of seconds and don&#x27;t touch eyes mouth or genitals until you wash your hands well! This is the mark of an excellent quality of perfume oils. Enjoy!☺</li>
    <li> WHAT A WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE I WAS WORRIED IT WOULDNT SMELL LIKE NAG CHAMPA BUT IT DOES AND IT LAST ALMOST ALL DAY WONDERFUL</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s lots of scented oils that claim to be nag champa smell but are not quite there--they smell fine, it&#x27;s just not nag champa.  This one smells right.  It&#x27;s also pretty strong so you only need a little bit.  You could even add it to stuff, I haven&#x27;t done it, but maybe lotions or soaps.  I use it every day and the bottle is still completely full.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is just what I wanted. It&#x27;s spicy and smokey, not fruity and powdery. I will be getting this again.</li>
    <li> I have always love the scent of Nag Champa..it is calming and mesmerizing st the same time. This brand of it is by far the best smelling I have found in a long time. A little goes a long way and the amount you get is fairly substantial. I am so pleased with this purchase, not only will I be buying more NC, I will be buying other scented oils they offer as well.</li>
    <li> Fragrance like Champa w/ hints of Plumeria. Lasts for several hours. I love it and will order more.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent....  I get lots of compliments on it!</li>
    <li> If you like the hippie earth scents check out  Nag Champa perfume oil 1.7 oz in glass bottle. Nice strong  incense smell. No alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Only need one or two drops. I used it in my homemade hand sanitizer (aloe vera gel/tea tree oil/witch hazel/lavender oil ) and put a few drops in my lotion. It will last a long time. I dipped a q-tip in the oil and put the q-tip in my car. I spilled a drop on the bottle so I wiped the bottle w/ the blue velvet bag it came in and put the bag in my closet. My closet smells like a head shop from the 70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like it so much I ordered 4. They tend to sell out fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shout out to the perfumer making this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for caring enough to create a True Nag Champa scent and not to skimp on the good stuff when mixing it.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Nag Champa.  Several friends told me to try it.  It&#x27;s lovely  perfume oil - a little goes a long way and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I put some in a very small glass bottle so I don&#x27;t open the larger bottle every time I want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The 1.7 oz glass bottle it comes in is very attractive.  The glass bottle itself is in a &amp;#34;velvety&amp;#34; indigo colored pouch.  It would make a beautiful gift.</li>
    <li> Really really strong - unlike the other bottles of perfume oil they sell.</li>
    <li> If you love nag champa then this is the product for you. This fragrance last all day. Powerful but not over bearing. Im addicted.  I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Scentsational Shoppe NJ inc has nailed this incredible essential oil fragrance. I use it in a diffuser, just 4-6 drops in water is all it takes to have your home smelling incredible for several hours. I plan on purchasing all of my oils through them.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS. Smells fantastic, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, very rich sweet true perfume version of Nag Champa, romantic and mysterious yet familiar and youthful with a solid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nicely made, priced fairly indeed, and sure to be a favorite for someone who likes their scent sweet and spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generous 1.7oz bottle makes this a very good value, too. Doesn&#x27;t fade in an hour, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sure hit.</li>
    <li> This perfume is absolutely awesome</li>
</ol>
