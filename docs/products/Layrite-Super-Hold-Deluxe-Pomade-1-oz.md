### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>For me, the best results is to add just a touch of water to it in your hands and mix it before applying.</li>
      <li>So happy they have a travel size!</li>
      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>Excellent hold and shine, but not greasy.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent pomade.</li>
      <li>It holds magnificently and doesn&#x27;t take forever to come out of your &#x27;stache.</li>
      <li>It has an incredible scent, hinted with vanilla.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great scent</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great hold.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, had fairly good results.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>Holds all day while looking good.</li>
      <li>it is a good product.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Great hold and shine to my curly hair with a nice texture and easy wash of the hair and hands.</li>
      <li>This pomade packs a nice warm vanilla scent that is not overbearing.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake, washes out easily and smells nice!</li>
      <li>Not only does it work incredibly well, but it also smells great, unlike some waxes I have heard of and reviewed.</li>
      <li>It was a good product that was shipped to me very quickly.</li>
      <li>Also, I love the fact that it&#x27;s water soluble.  </li>
      <li>so i just ended up looking for a better price.</li>
      <li>Perfect smaller size for packing.  </li>
      <li>glad it came to me in about a week.</li>
      <li>I just typed 7 more words today.</li>
      <li>and it works pretty good.</li>
      <li>I also really like the smell, but I ordered Super Hold, and it doesn&#x27;t really hold the best, for some better hold I would use suavecito, uppercut deluxe or monster, or imperial.</li>
      <li>Same awesome hold and same great smell.</li>
      <li>Regardless, this is amazing hair product, and it washes right out.</li>
      <li>Best pomade hands down.</li>
      <li>I would most definitely recommend this product to someone looking for a moustache wax or a nice pomade to get that vintage \\&quot;Dapper Dan\\&quot; look.</li>
      <li>This product did not give me a &#x27;super hold&#x27;.</li>
      <li>but in an understated, fetid, spoiled kind of way) and the hold is not all that super, but it does hold a little and is super easy to work with.  </li>
      <li>It acts like a wax, goes on like a gel, and washes right out with water when you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>works really well with medium to long hair and nice scent to it.</li>
      <li>It says &amp;#34;Super Hold&amp;#34; but functions more like a regular pomade or gel than anything else.</li>
      <li>Great product - firm hold, low shine.  </li>
      <li>good product, not thrilled about the scent</li>
      <li>Nice but really small</li>
      <li>The only downside is that it can gunk up pretty</li>
      <li>Be aware it comes in a super small bottle.</li>
      <li>Tried the competition and Lay rite is the clear winner.</li>
      <li>I could smell the pomade in my hair hours later, very aromatic.</li>
      <li>That should really be the big selling point here: water-soluble.</li>
      <li>1 oz did not last long at all and honestly, too expensive to purchase several more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several moustache waxes and even hairspray for my handlebar--this is my first pomade and my initial take is that I don&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
      <li>Try American Crew products which actually live up to their billing.</li>
      <li>My facial hair is naturally curly</li>
      <li>well kind expensive</li>
      <li>I like it, doesnt seem to make my hair stay down as much as I was hoping.</li>

    <li> Works well.  U can flat iron before and/or after without flaking.</li>
    <li> My husband uses pomade type hair products and tried this one. 1 oz did not last long at all and honestly, too expensive to purchase several more. But he did like it and was disappointed when it was gone</li>
    <li> This is an excellent pomade. This isn&#x27;t you Dapper Dan pomade. It has an incredible scent, hinted with vanilla. I could smell the pomade in my hair hours later, very aromatic. Along with it&#x27;s great scent comes it&#x27;s great hold. It combs through hair nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel overly thick that it&#x27;s impossible to get a comb through. It&#x27;s held my hair all day from after shower to bed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was doing something wrong but it made my hair crusty, no hold, no shine and just overall didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> This product did not give me a &#x27;super hold&#x27;. Try American Crew products which actually live up to their billing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this was a travel size. Guess I should slow down and pay closer attention. Regardless, this is amazing hair product, and it washes right out. Unlike hair wax. I do wish they made it without fragrance though...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, had fairly good results. The only downside is that it can gunk up pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note though: A 1oz supply will probably only last you for a couple weeks. Go with the bigger 4oz size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several moustache waxes and even hairspray for my handlebar--this is my first pomade and my initial take is that I don&#x27;t care for it.  The smell is off-putting (faintly reminiscent of vanilla...but in an understated, fetid, spoiled kind of way) and the hold is not all that super, but it does hold a little and is super easy to work with.  Also, I love the fact that it&#x27;s water soluble.  Long term results to follow...</li>
    <li> That should really be the big selling point here: water-soluble. It acts like a wax, goes on like a gel, and washes right out with water when you&#x27;re done. It holds magnificently and doesn&#x27;t take forever to come out of your &#x27;stache. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product - firm hold, low shine.  So happy they have a travel size!</li>
    <li> Best pomade hands down.</li>
    <li> Excellent hold and shine, but not greasy. This pomade packs a nice warm vanilla scent that is not overbearing.</li>
    <li> Great hold and shine to my curly hair with a nice texture and easy wash of the hair and hands.</li>
    <li> A little too sticky and gummy for me. Did not hold my fine/limp wavy hair. I prefer the Gatsby Grit gel.</li>
    <li> I like it, doesnt seem to make my hair stay down as much as I was hoping. Mix with got2b glue and it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother. He doesn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> This has become my everyday hair product.  It doesn&#x27;t get crusty say if your hair gets messed with.  Holds quite well, holds even shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moustache wax that would hold throughout the day and heard about Layrite though a youtube video. My facial hair is naturally curly and I have tried other waxes to no avail, however, once I began working in the Layrite, my moustache immediately began to take shape and hold. Not only does it work incredibly well, but it also smells great, unlike some waxes I have heard of and reviewed. I would most definitely recommend this product to someone looking for a moustache wax or a nice pomade to get that vintage \\&quot;Dapper Dan\\&quot; look.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Doesn&#x27;t flake, washes out easily and smells nice!</li>
    <li> Nice but really small</li>
    <li> It was a good product that was shipped to me very quickly. I also really like the smell, but I ordered Super Hold, and it doesn&#x27;t really hold the best, for some better hold I would use suavecito, uppercut deluxe or monster, or imperial.</li>
    <li> Tried the competition and Lay rite is the clear winner.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Same awesome hold and same great smell. I opened the packaging and thought &amp;#34;this may be the cutest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen&amp;#34;. Just like the 4oz, except smaller.</li>
    <li> good product, not thrilled about the scent</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now and i will never go back to junk products again. I have thick hair that i like to slick back and to the side. For me, the best results is to add just a touch of water to it in your hands and mix it before applying. When applying, start in the middle of your head at the nase and just start mixing it evenly from front to back and side to side. Follow up with using your fingers as a comb or a basic comb. Do not use a brush. Holds all day while looking good. Washes out with just water. Everyone asks me what i use because they dig the hold it gives witbout looking stiff and dry.</li>
    <li> Perfect smaller size for packing.  I also bought the largest size and will refill this jar as necessary, which will be cheaper in the long run.</li>
    <li> it is a good product. glad it came to me in about a week. it was 1 ounce for $8. ??  well kind expensive so i just ended up looking for a better price. and got the larger size from layrite itself.</li>
    <li> Not very good. Be aware it comes in a super small bottle. It says &amp;#34;Super Hold&amp;#34; but functions more like a regular pomade or gel than anything else. My hair texture is a little thicker so maybe that&#x27;s why but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this at all. And the bottle that&#x27;s sold here will last you less than a week.</li>
    <li> works really well with medium to long hair and nice scent to it. I just typed 7 more words today.</li>
