    <li> Leaves your lips feeling soft and moisturized. I can&#x27;t understand why the  huge cost to ship this is so high.</li>
    <li> A M A Z I N G Product! I don&#x27;t give a lot of reviews but when I do. It&#x27;s because it is SO deserving to give one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EYE LASHES: ( Just apply carefully. You can even use your finger if you&#x27;d like. Make sure to not put some in your eye. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----I am madly in love with this Vitamin E stick. My boyfriend and I have noticed that my eyelashes are getting longer, darker, and thick. I have a very teary eyes. Which is the reason why I have dark under eye! I kept rubbing them and rubbing them non stop to the point my under eye circle are raw and have gotten dark!  Also, whenever I would rub, my eyelashes would fall out one by one. Ever since I&#x27;ve used this product... I don&#x27;t see much eyelashes fall out. I am so lucky to have tried this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DARK UNDER EYE: ( NIGHT TIME:  Wash your face with your favorite face wash. Pat till dry with towel. Take this stick and Just dab it on your under eye. Make sure you look up so it doesn&#x27;t get in your eye. Leave it on and get some sleep! ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---Like I said up above, I&#x27;ve gotten my dark under eye because I kept rubbing off my tear. ALSO, I am a gamer so I stay up real late and wake up early for work. Which is not good for my under eye. GET ATLEAST 8-9 Hours of sleep !. My boyfriend have asked me &amp;#34; Are you wearing the concealer I bought you? &amp;#34; No. I wasn&#x27;t. So obviously it is getting better. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week STRAIGHT. and I can already tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIPS: ( Apply like any other chapstick!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----Vitamin E has seriously beaten Nivea Chapstick. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I LOVE nivea chapstick. This product just stays on longer!.  Burt&#x27;s Bees are great as well but after awhile my lips still gets dry and peels off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s only $0.83 but  I&#x27;ve paid about $5.00 ish because of the shipping.. But it is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I bought this wanting a wax free, petroleum free, natural product. Ha! It says &amp;#34;Perfectly Pure Vitamin E Stick&amp;#34;, with no ingredients listed. Makes you think it&#x27;s made out of pure vitamin E, right? I figured it was just hydrogenated Vitamin E oil. Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made out of three different waxes, petroleum byproducts, parabens, and preservatives. There is *some* Vitamin E oil in it, but it&#x27;s the second to last ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does work and does feel nice, but it is absolutely unsuitable for vegans, vegetarians, or anybody choosing to avoid parabens or hormone disrupters.</li>
    <li> I bought this stick for use on surgical scars. The physical therapists advised \\&quot;use anything with Vitamin E\\&quot;, I found this and no where on the tube does it mention lips. Anyhow the price was right. It was much easier and much less messy than an oil. Two rotator cuff surgeries later, you can hardly notice a scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the last review, I think I&#x27;ll start using it also as a lip balm. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Vitamin E stick for several years - I almost never use anything else on my lips. There&#x27;s no flavorings that might irritate, just nice and smooth vitamin E that goes on clear.</li>
    <li> Went through chemotherapy. Lips very dry &amp; crusty. This lip balm is the best. No wax..which only cakes on your lips &amp; makes them look worse instead of better. My lips split at both sides occasionally.  This also heals that area.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy as long as it is available. The only negative was the high cost for shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that it does in fact contain a paraben.  I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> Love mine, got this at walmarts pharmacy!</li>
    <li> Great little moisturizer stick to carry in your purse!  Keeps those little dry areas moist and goes under or over make up easily without any smudging!</li>
    <li> Hard to find but this the best lip moisturizer I have found,  I have also used it on my cuticles!!!</li>
    <li> I found this at Walmart for $1.50 in the supplement section. This is truly a quality product. I am using it on my lips which peel even with a typical chapstick. But this product truly moisturizes and stops my lips from peeling. I am very grateful for finally having the cure for my lips and at an affordable price. I would tell anyone about this product.</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t get to try this product because when it arrived, it didn&#x27;t have any safety seal on it and had a mark on the lipstick so I chose not to use it. For all I know someone could have touched it or used it. I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it because there was no protective seal, looked like it was already opened. I didn&#x27;t send it back because the cost would have been more to send back so I ended up throwing it out. So I can&#x27;t speak for the product itself. I just didn&#x27;t care for the way it was packaged. Probably won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> My mom gave me this as a gift and I started out using it on my scars. I scar very easily (mostly from cuts) and it heals them very nicely. I wouldn&#x27;t say it makes the go completely away, but they&#x27;re definitely less noticeable. Within the past couple months I read that Vitamin E is also great for dry lips, so I gave it a try. It works great on lips! I just ran out and I&#x27;ve been scrambling for over a week now trying to find some place that has it. I guess I&#x27;ll have to order a bunch online now!</li>
    <li> I bought this stick to prevent some recently healed burns from scarring. After 3-4 weeks of use, one mark vanished completely, and the other one is continuing to fade. For only $1.50 at the Wal*mart pharmacy, it was the bargain of the year, and I like the vintage packaging. It would have been nice if the product came with a safety seal and ingredients list, but the important thing is that this treatment really seems to work. I would definitely re-purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> Exactly the product I was looking for. Natural Vitamin E in a lipstick tube to use for a natural chap stick.</li>
    <li> Very good.  Keeps lips moist.</li>
    <li> Found this in the vitamin supplements section and bought it because it cost 76 cents. I have been using all over my face (including my lips &amp; eye area) &amp; I am in love. My skin just drinks this stuff up leaving a nice matt finish. My skin feels soft too!! I&#x27;m going to buy more next time. This is a great product &amp; yes, I will be recommending it to family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I use it mostly on my eyelashes. I got tired of always having dark circles because of mascara use. So I started curling them and putting the vitamin E on instead. It works for me :) you can also use it under mascara and it makes it easier to remove.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Was a Christmas gift</li>
    <li> I have been using perfectly pure vitamin e lip moisturizing stick on my eyelid to help moisturize my lashes for a month now and i have only seen a little improvement however, my bottom eyelashes seem to be noticeable now than before.  I do have very short eyelashes and i would like them to grow a little longer.  The reviews that i previously read prior to using the product stated that the product doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes longer but it moisturizes them thereby making them fuller.  I will try to use it for 2 more weeks to complete a total of 6 weeks with hopes to see more improvement.  I am not disappointed but maybe just a little impatient.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Ingredients: Castor Oil, Candelilla Wax, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Lanolin, Isopropyl Myristate, Beeswax, Mineral Oil, Carnauba Wax, Mica Titanium Dioxide, Vitamin E, Propyl Paraben &amp; BHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this via this website: http://chaptastic.blogspot.com/2007/03/plain-old-vitamin-e-stick.html in the comments section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated 3 stars bc it does seem to work, however, the name is quite misleading as Vitamin E is not a top ingredient.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  First purchased at Wal*Mart, but of course, couldn&#x27;t find it on a subsequent visit.  Great for conditioning and moisturizing dry lips.</li>
