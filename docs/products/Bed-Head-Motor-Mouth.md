    <li> My stylist recommend this product to me and I am in love! It does have gloss in it which is great. The bottle states use 2 to 3 pumps but that is just too much. I use 1 pump and get great looking hair!  I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since I stated using it.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shiny and manageable but still has some body. My favorite new product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! I love everything about it: smell, texture, and the result.</li>

    <li> Love it...it was 22.00 elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This product is great for styling your hair. It smells delicious!</li>

    <li> Makes my thick hair fuller with great shine!</li>
    <li> did not like this at all! It did not add body and my hair felt dry .</li>
    <li> This product might volumize...but I will never know because the smell is so atrocious (like really bad candy cologne) I absolutely can&#x27;t have it anywhere around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a trend with this company wanting their products to smell like candy (RIP bed head manipulator).</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as a volumizer for me.  Made my hair really greasy and flat.  Normally I love TIGI products.  This is the first one that I was completely unhappy with. It took a long time to arrive (several weeks) and it was shipped during sub-zero weather.  I suspected it may have been damaged by the weather because I&#x27;ve had hand lotions and other products change consistency after being shipped in the cold luggage/cargo compartments of airlines.  I tried to return it, but they wouldn&#x27;t take it back.  Told me to contact the manufacturer!  I won&#x27;t do business with this vendor again and I won&#x27;t risk buying this product again, just in case the next one produces the same bad results.  Since TIGI products are usually consistently good, I really think it was ruined during shipping.  Frustrated that the vendor refused to refund my money.</li>

    <li> Love the smell. Works ok with my thinner hair.</li>
    <li> Love the product but who ever shipped it the lid was not tight and it leaked out some. And I can not get the lid to unscrew and pop up.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have thin hair and it definitely made a difference.  Not a &amp;#34;clubber&amp;#34; so the UV glow is pointless but it does add a bit of shine.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair but I have a lot of it. Its also color treated. This product is awesome. Hands down.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this on my hair and I had to have it!  It is amazing!!!!</li>
