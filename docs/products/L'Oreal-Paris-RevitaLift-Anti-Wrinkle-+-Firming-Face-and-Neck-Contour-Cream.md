<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is pretty good and now I am looking to purchase the complete set.</li>
    <li> love the way it feels</li>
    <li> Really Good Face And Neck Cream Just What i Wanted</li>
    <li> I think the cream is ok. It seems to make my skin feel a little nicer but I can&#x27;t stand the smell. I could not finish using it.</li>
    <li> This promises alot, but does not deliver! Mature, dry, or very dry skin needs hydration and this cream dries your skin out. Does nothing for the neck either!</li>
    <li> I began to get compliments about how much firmer my neck looked only a couple of weeks after I started using this. So while I wasn&#x27;t sure anything was happening, those compliments proved it was working. Maybe it&#x27;s the massaging you do when you apply it, or maybe Revitalift really does the trick. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> I have used loreal products for years.  Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> Works great, love it.</li>
    <li> Very good product, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Love the product and good service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a positive improvement on my neck so I&#x27;m continuing to use it and am on my second jar.  I have tried several products and none have worked as well as this one. Since I have very sensitive skin, I always use products like Olay, Aveeno and Yes but none of them have worked as well as L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bit greasy (perhaps more moisturizing than I need). Didn&#x27;t see immediate spectacular results but some improvement in deep wrinkles. It&#x27;s not the miracle product I always hope for but as good as most comparable products within similar price range. Got it here for good price. I&#x27;d buy again when find it at good price but won&#x27;t give up looking for alternative with better results or better value for same.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product to combat fine lines on the face and neck.  I have fought acne since my teens and now in my forties, it is better but I always have a pimple or two and some severe breakouts.  I was excited to see the reviews on this product and it was noncomedogenic so I thought I had found a dream product.  The first day I washed as usual and used the cream, it left my skin soft and dewy and while it smells just like old fashion cold cream, I loved the way my skin looked.  I washed thoroughly before bed and put on my retin-a.  On the second day, I had the same results until the end of the day, by the end of the day my skin was slick with oil?? Not sure why, I thought that maybe it was the pizza I ate for lunch. Same thing, washed thoroughly and used the retin-a.  So today, the third day, I woke up with pimples all over my face and especially my jaw and forehead.  I washed and tried putting it on again but with an hour my face was covered with whiteheads.  So, off it came and on went the oxy!!  So if you have bad flare-ups of acne, this product may not be for you.  It is sad because my skin looked beautiful the first day :(</li>
    <li> After moving to a desert climate 15 years ago, I found that a very good moisturing cream was necessary for the face and neck that would keep my skin hydrated all day.  This product does this and more!  There are many days here with 10% or less relative humidity, and I know that this cream will keep my skin from feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since last 3 months and I should say that it made my extremely dry skin look wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Let me apologize ahead of time for my review because I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t know all the terms for facial discriptions when it comes to \\&quot;beauty tips.\\&quot; Anyways, I got this product mostly out of curiosity, but I am glad I did and would recommend it to anyone. I have a bad habit since childhood of pushing together my eyebrows to sheild my eyes from the sun, and have created creases or \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot; (though I don&#x27;t think they are really \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot; in terms of aging) on my forehead between the two eyebrows. I applied the cream to the area including on my cheeks and neck. After only 4 days, I noticed the wrinkle between my eyebrows dramatically decrased. I also noticed the appearance of a firmer jaw-line. I noticed the affects after only 4 days, which is probably fast and may sound too good to be true, but I am in my mid twenties, so that may contribute to how fast it works. Anyways this product works, and is definitely cool. Ummm.. sorry.. had to throw that last bit in so my review wouldn&#x27;t sound so feminine...yo. Ahem.</li>
    <li> I am a male, 31 and was at first startled by brow and laugh lines, because I have always looked younger than my age. And...I wasn&#x27;t about to forego my parents&#x27; generous genetic legacy (they look much younger, too). So, I researched wrinkle smothers and found this cream to be one of the most affordable and, after using it, most effective. There are probably better - there are certainly more expensive - but on my tight budget, I am very pleased.    I was surprised at just how quickly I saw a difference and that others do as well. I have gotten complements that my skin seems brighter, my smile easier - things like that. Practically, I noticed a reduction in lines in under a week. I wish I had taken before/after photos, but I am happy.    Caveat Emptor: This cream complements a skin care regimen for me and is applied at night after 2, or 3 astringents. If you have oily skin, you may want to use benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, witch hazel, etc. before applying. Also, there is a fragrance so, gentlemen, you may want to apply this at night before you go to bed, instead of before you&#x27;re off to face the world.</li>
    <li> guess it doesnt work for all. cant say its done anything for my neck. still look old</li>
    <li> Living at the beach year round my face sometimes takes a beating between the sun in the summer and the wind in the winter. This product seems to have eased the wrinkles. Been using it for about 2 weeks and I think I can see a difference...or at least it seems that way.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant on purchasing due to price and my age (not old enough to really need this, ya right!) Anyway, after just a few days noticed a reduction in my laugh lines around my mouth and the little wrinkles from squinting in the sun around my eyes are gone.  A little goes a long way so the price isn&#x27;t even worth a comment as it will last for months. Love it and recommend it to anyone wanting to tighten up a little!</li>
    <li> Very good products. It is creamy and is absorbed quickly. I like the light feeling and scent. I use it before I put on my face foundation makeup. The nighttime version is a heavier, creamier mixture. This one is perfect for daytime, and works great under makeup. Love it and can definitely see a difference in the appearnace and texture of my skin. I really love it and will reorder. A little goes a long way, and is a better price than at the store!</li>
    <li> This seems to be a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Takes the dryness away.Iwould use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel a difference with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Very easy to use, and effective. Hydrates face skin wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I usually use another brand but I decided to buy this since I have had many friends going on about it for quite some time. After the third use or so I started seeing results and people started asking me what I was doing and telling me I looked younger. Revitalift is worth the money!</li>
    <li> My mom loves this product.&lt;br /&gt;She uses it as instructed and serves her well.&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t much to say - it isn&#x27;t surgery, but it does help.&lt;br /&gt;The price is way better than retail stores as well!</li>
    <li> Very nice face cream....L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced RevitaLift Face and Neck Day Cream, 1.7 Ounce...and a Great price of 13.00 I like it because it&#x27;s not too light or heavy and not greasy!~</li>
    <li> I ordered this and paid for it over a week ago and it arrived to today, but once again, (3rd time ordering L&#x27;Oreal from Amazon) they shipped me the wrong item! I absolutely can&#x27;t believe it. That makes 3xs in a row that Amazon has shipped me the wrong beauty product.I don&#x27;t think their shipping staff knows how to read English or for that matter how to tell colors apart. Even the box looks different.The box for this product is mostly white and the box I received is 1/2 red. They shipped me the Revitalift anti wrinkle and firming cream, but it&#x27;s not the advanced formula, which is what I ordered.So watch your delivery that you get what you are paying for, especially in the beauty department. Amazon is really lacking in their ability to ship the right product. Needless to say Amazon has some serious internal problem that they are not fixing and just letting the public suffer while they take our money assuming we won&#x27;t complain...wrong! I don&#x27;t want anyone else to go thru what Amazon has been putting me thru. If this happens to you, be sure to file a complaint and phone them and let them know what happened to your order.</li>
    <li> This product is a splurge for me....but, it&#x27;s well worth the $! I usually use ponds cream..it&#x27;s cheap and very thick for my dry skin. However, this lotion has spf in it, and I feel like it protects my skin better..it&#x27;s worth the extra 10 dollars!</li>
    <li> Good product all around for my face</li>
    <li> According to ChaCha.com:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Loreal Paris ended all testing on finished products on animals in 1989, however new chemical ingredients must be tested on animals.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope- will not be buying any of their products...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. Absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> excellent price for this product, the delivery time was very quick and the product packaging was new and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Ok guys, I bought this to remove this deep wrinkle I have on my forehead. I am not vain, but I just wanted to see if there was a way to minimize this deep wrinkle. Without asking my wife, I bought this to try it. I have to say, after 2 weeks, my skin looks much better. The wrinkle is still there but everyone says my skin looks younger. I will keep using it till it is finished to see if it gets even better.  But so far so good.</li>
    <li> What is this miracle in a bottle l&#x27;oreal is selling and why haven&#x27;t I heard of it before? In one week, Revitalift face and neck has erased two deep lines on my forehead, begun to firm my extremely saggy eyelids, and lightened some fine lines under my eyes. I use this product with my youth code serum and at 38 I&#x27;ve decided this will be my anti wrinkle treatment from now on. I always thought these type of products were scams, but Loreal has THE formula. An anti wrinkle cream that actually erases wrinkles!!!! who would have guessed?</li>
    <li> i bought it for my 34 yr old husband. he&#x27;s wrinkles are not too deep but before they get that way i really wanted to buy him something to use on a nightly basis. he has used it for 6 weeks and missed putting it on 2 times. i can see a difference already. his forehead looks smoother from those tiny little cracks and the deeper ones are looking better too.</li>
    <li> I did not use this product for more than 3 days...each time forcing myself.  I don&#x27;t know if it would work.  I am 52 years old.  But the smell reminded me of an 80 year old grandmother...sorry grandma....who doused herself with floral scent.  And the texture was waxy and thick.  My hubby could smell me a mile away.  Yuk! Had to explain to friends that it wasn&#x27;t perfume.</li>
    <li> I really love Loreal cosmetics. I used to use a moisturizer that only did just that, moisturize, but with this one, I like the way it tones down the lines and wrinkles (not that I have that many) but it really makes the skin smooth and firms. Will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> I am 65 and since retiring over a decade ago I have pretty much stopped wearing makeup. I have been blessed on both sides of the gene pool with miracle genes - hardly any gray hair or wrinkles but I have developed some under eye crinkles. I have found when I use this every day it makes a definite difference in that area, a huge difference. I never believed in moisturizes before and pretty much considered any positive results to be purely psychological but this actually works, for me anyway.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I will order it again because it does work on dry skin and regular skin.  It has lasted for quite a while, so I&#x27;m ready to buy again.</li>
    <li> Used for several month,feel like wasted my money,it&#x27;s ok for moisturizing,didn&#x27;t do anything else,very disappointing.1 star for moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love LOREAL Revitalift BUT when I first started buying it(3 years ago), the jar weighed more than 3 oz. and cost $[...] in the STORES.  Then last year the jar weighed 2.55 oz for the SAME price.  Now, it weighs 1.7 oz. and costs the SAME!  AMAZON sells it for a little less than $[...] BUT we&#x27;re getting less and less of it.  It is incredibly annoying.  The product may be good but it is still a scam when it comes to price etc.</li>
    <li> I received the product in time but the package was torn. The mailing box is perfect, but the product package is torn and the container looks like it has a lot of scratches.</li>
    <li> I use this morning and night...love the way it feels on my face, the mild fragrance and everything about it.  Too early to know if I will soon look like I&#x27;m 20, and I&#x27;m not counting on that, but I am sticking with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for almost 2 months.  I am 51, with minimal wrinkles, but I still did not see any significant improvement. I won&#x27;t buy again.  Also, I started to break out on my forehead, which I attribute to this cream. Not happy with that, as I have had no problems with pimples until I started using this cream.  In my opinion it does not do anything for wrinkles or firming.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my 8th purchase. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I Love this cream, I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve never look fresher. It is very smooth and easy to apply. Will continue to use this for a long time.</li>
    <li> My skiing feels great and soft. I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent, because I see the results.  I want to order some more, before I run out, lasted me approximate 60 days now.&lt;br /&gt;Saw improvements first week.  Yes I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> This cream is fabulous when used nightly, it is awesome! It firms and smoothes your skin, smells really nice too!</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my face. I have used it before but it was becoming difficult to find. So glad I did!</li>
    <li> I have the classic T-zone face - dry on the cheeks, mouth area, oily on the nose/forehead.  I was looking for a day cream that wouldn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and keep me moisturized, especially during these winter months when my skin is drier than normal.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks and I have to say it really does a good job.  It&#x27;s not erasing any wrinkles per se - but I use it very sparingly due to my oily areas - and so far I have really  noticed my skin texture and complexion feeling and looking very smooth.  I use higher-end products at night (i.e., Dr. Perricone products) and was looking for a more affordable day cream just to keep me moisturized and I really think this one does the job.  If you apply it (sparingly) right after you wash your face in the morning, the cream aborbs wonderfully and it&#x27;s not greasy if you use small amounts.  I&#x27;m just really impressed that it&#x27;s keeping the texture of my skin nice and smooth during these cold, dry winter months.  Probably the best day cream I&#x27;ve used yet - better than the Roc day cream I think.</li>
    <li> I loved this product, but wasn&#x27;t able to continue use as I developed an allergy to an ingredient in the product.</li>
    <li> Well, this morning I was watching Good Morning America!  Seriously Loreal?  You&#x27;re now putting \\&quot;older women\\&quot; for your commercials, BUT, come on, this was rather insulting.  Jane Fonda 75, who as we all know has had a lot of surgical procedures done on her face, looking like she&#x27;s 50 something!!!!!!!  I bought this product, yes, worked a little....I&#x27;m 64, 118 lbs.,5&#x27;5 1/2\\&quot; work out, have good aging genes, but, like everyone things do begin to change.  If we all had her money, we&#x27;d all look 50 years old.  She&#x27;s not the true 75 and there&#x27;s nothing any product can do about it, so PLEASE think next time you do a commercial!!!</li>
    <li> JoAnn, at 61, has a lovely complexion and she attributes it Revitalift and the non use of facial soaps. Her coworkers and others are amazed at the condition of her shin. I can confirm that her skin/complexion is better than most people her age. Amazon has the best price on this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I lost some weight for my wedding and wanted to tighten up my jawline. After a week I noticed a difference and by the time of my wedding, no more jowly jawline. Wow. I can&#x27;t say enough. It is less expensive than some other products out there but works just as well.</li>
    <li> I use it as a neck cream. Love the feel of it.</li>
    <li> It is a great moisturizer but it did absolutely nothing to FIRM or remove even the smallest wrinkle.  I gave it a 4 STAR because it makes your neck and face feel smooth, plus it isn&#x27;t greasy and it absorbs quickly into the skin.  However, what they advertize that this product will do for wrinkles isn&#x27;t happening, at least for me and I surely have plenty of wrinkles for this product to practice on. If you want a good moisturizer this is it - I will purchase this product again. In all my years searching for a anti-aging wrinkle formula I haven&#x27;t found one that actually lives up to the advertising HYPE./.../.</li>
    <li> I buy this again and again as it seems to nourish and give moisture to my dry skin, feels good and looks good too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I saw the difference it made in my skin after a few days and tossed out all my other creams.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this cream</li>
    <li> I use this every night on my neck area. It really helps prevent wrinkly looking skin. I keep it in the fridge so when I apply at night it is cool.</li>
    <li> Burned my face like it was on Fire!!!  Also have little bumps on face now!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and there is a HUGE difference in my skin. Even my husband said my skin looks smooth and gooey and a lot less wrinkles. I&#x27;m 59 and people tell me I look in my 40&#x27;s. AMAZING. But you have to use it twice a day to get the total effects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to strong odors, and cannot use make up or skin products with fragrance. I bought this one by mistake. When I bought the fragrance free version of the same product, it turned out to be really good.</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry and this rich cream works perfectly for me. Does not cause milia.</li>
    <li> i  love  it&lt;br /&gt;thanks  great  deal  great  price..thanks</li>
    <li> I used it every morning every day, and it provides the sun protection I need.  It goes on smoothly and evenly without being oily and is just easy to use.</li>
    <li> My favorite night cream!</li>
    <li> I noticed an amazing difference in the very first use of this product! I definitely recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> Been trying this lotion for a little over  a week now and have already noticed my face lifting a  bit and wrinkles getting less and less. :)</li>
    <li> I love this cream and have been using it for a while.  It is relatively in expensive and I love that it is mild enough to use in the eye area, which is a really savings to me since for the size you receive, eye creams can be quite pricey!  Does is get rid of wrinkles, I would say no - I think Retin-A is your best bet - but I do like that it keeps my skin subtle and moisturized but not oily.  I&#x27;ve tired other creams which either sting or are too oily but this one seems to be just right.</li>
    <li> This is a great product you can really see results after 2 weeks of use!!!! I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works on the crepy skin on my neck. It is a lovely all around moisturizer too and a very good price.</li>
    <li> Been using this L&#x27;Oreal product and others for years.  It has worked for me.  The price is so much less expensive than products sold at department stores (have also used several of these, and find the L&#x27;Oreal products just as good).</li>
    <li> i love this stuff i get it all the time its very strange cause this product makes your skin sparkly very weird.... and makes your skin soft to :) &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I feel this is good quality and value for the price. Nice fragrance but not strong. You can feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;Also moisturizes and goes under makeup well.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this and will buy it again.  Would give it 5 stars if there were SPF protection.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this when I ran out of my Roc products. Can&#x27;t compare. I think my skin doesnt look as good, definitely doesnt feel as good. I&#x27;ve relegated this to just my neck and bought more Roc for face.</li>
    <li> I keep getting older and gravity is not your friend as you age. But this cream just feels good. When you feel good, you look good. Also, it fits well on the shelf, is comfortable in my hand and the top is easy to get off. I&#x27;m not looking for miracles, but when I find something that gives me pleasure, I use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent creme, very pleased</li>
    <li> It is okay.  Did nothing exceptional for my skin.  I think Pond&#x27;s cream would be a moisturizer that is just as good and less expensive.</li>
    <li> The product is not what I expected but it&#x27;s not bad for keeping the face moisturized. I&#x27;ve had this product now for approximately 6 weeks and have not seen any firming effects from it. I will admit that it keeps my skin moist. Not a bad product but stating that you see results in 4 weeks is not accurate.</li>
    <li> A perfectly nice face cream, leaving soft, smooth skin, but a tad short on the &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; portion....maybe because I&#x27;m in my early 60s and just waited too long to use it...can&#x27;t expect miracles from an over-the-counter product, after all! Wish I had started using creams like this, oh, 20 years ago. Ladies, take care of your skin and the earlier the better! Would recommend this for someone in their 40s or 50s, though. I&#x27;m still playing around with different products, myself.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for 2 months and my skin looks better &amp; smoother. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> nice item, fast express</li>
    <li> Nice thick cream but it seems to soak in immediately with really no intense moisturizing qualities. I actually used mine as a hand and arm lotion before I went to bed as it really did not deliver as a facial cream. I prefer the olay night creams to this brand. In addition this cream caused some small breakouts on my face, seemed to really clog my pores. But, I did give it 2 stars since I was able to use on my hands and arms with no issues. If you have slightly sensitive skin on your face you may want to try with caution your first few applications to see if you have any reactions.</li>
    <li> Smells too much like cold cream</li>
    <li> Have ordered this time and time again.  Good buy. Works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer. I have been using it for several months. I am planning to start using other L&#x27;Oreal products since I&#x27;ve had such good results with this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a cream, nothing special. It does soak into the skin well. No greasy film. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> really nice , feels good ...no complaints !</li>
    <li> Use it every day.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product has helped to to clear up some old spots on my face and it has lightened up my face a great deal even under my eyes.  My face also looks smooth. The product has smooth out a wrinkle on the right side of my face but it has not helped the one on the left side nor did it remove any of the lines from my neck.  Amazingly, it has done something dramatic to my face because I see men looking at me more now than they did before and I am starting to feel shy and my face does look somewhat younger despite the line on my neck.  Another Loreal product helped with two of the long thin lines so I now have only one deep line to deal with on my neck and one on the left side of my face.</li>
    <li> The nicest soft, smooth night cream.</li>
    <li> i needed a little extra help to keep a taught skin.  i was literally using no cream at all but after 9 yrs. of struggling after 3 strokes i decided i was ready to start using cream.  in those 9 yrs. i got a few sharp lines, especially around the mouth, but this cream made my skin feel like new again.  it doesn&#x27;t make one young again but it makes the skin feel supple again.  it also affords one great protection from cold, dry weather.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, it was reasonable priced and included retinol.  I did not see any difference from using this product.  I have used the whole jar and I won&#x27;t buy it again because L&#x27;Oreal  has another product I like much better.  This lotion was soft, not greasy. it was okay. For just a moisturizer its awesome, but for a firming lotion, not so much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to get on the subscription right before I run out.  I don&#x27;t have to try other cream because I forgot what I was using or get quilted into buying cheaper  love it</li>
    <li> I use this product every day 2 times a day morning and before I go to bed. I already see the difference in my face.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;oreal Paris Advanced RevitalLift  was ok .. the first jar is just the primer .. it states it takes 30 days to see a difference so you actually have to buy two jars to see results .. which I never did .It does make your face smoother feeling but .. I can&#x27;t afford a small jar of this product to just get smooth skin . Keep your hard earned money, I know I will from now on.</li>
    <li> It has only been a week of using this and already I see fine lines disappearing!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how I look after a month.  It was listed as one of the top sellers and it was a welcome price as it came in as number 3 on the top list of wrinkle products and the first two were over $100.00!</li>
    <li> Light enough for day use.  I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the one I always come back to.</li>
    <li> Not sure about the anti-wrinkle part, but the lotion is non-irritating to my sensitive skin and I definitely feel better about my skin when I use it.</li>
    <li> my skin nice and soft. It was resolved winkle after use this product and the cream is smell really good.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel more tight and firm.  It leave it soft and supple.  I have noticed a reduction of fine lines and wrinkles since using it.</li>
    <li> I and LOVE her, but don&#x27;t want to smell like a bed of roses. I have no idea if it works because I applied it once and the smell sent me right back to the store to return it. Grossssss</li>
    <li> My skin looks better and smoother. The product does everything is claims to do. It is a quality product for the price.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of lotion on my face &amp; I believe I see results from using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that it would actually firm and contour or provide a little lift.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Sorry, girls.  This one is ok for moisturizing but did nothing for wrinkles, neck, or face sag.  I have tried about thirty of these products so far from cheap to very expensive and have yet to really feel like something works.  I will keep trying.</li>
    <li> This product did get here on time.&lt;br /&gt;The package was right.&lt;br /&gt;But to be honest is too soon for me write a good or bad review.&lt;br /&gt;It only been used for such a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Products like this deserve for you to wait a period of time.&lt;br /&gt;So I can comment on certain things.&lt;br /&gt;Other then the fact that I myself don&#x27;t use this product is my husband.&lt;br /&gt;I can only comment on what I know so far.</li>
    <li> If I remember to use this, I do love the way it seeps into my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily.  I just wish I would remember to put it on every night, because I do think it helps.</li>
    <li> Used it twice a day did not see any change my skin.  most L&#x27;Oreal products do a pretty good job and live up to expectations, not this one. I would not recommend</li>
    <li> The older I get the more I notice my skin is drying out. I have always used a light moisturizer but since turning 40 I have noticed that my regular moisturizer didn&#x27;t work anymore. So I began trying  other moisturizer and face creams and most felt greasy. Revitalift is light and doesnt leave that greasy feeling, plus my skin just looks healthy now and feels soft again. I will never use anything else. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see where it is working but what is worse than all is the smell!  Too stinky and strong smelling.  I don&#x27;t like perfume smell...its awful!</li>
    <li> One of my favorites, but unfortunately, getting harder and harder to find. Thankfully, Amazon always comes thru!  Great for dry, and/or maturing skin.</li>
    <li> Its ok but nothing special. My hubby gave it to me as a birthday present.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a big difference, but do like the feel of the creme, not to oily but does have a deep creme feel to it.</li>
    <li> As with many cosmetic lines, the manufacturer recommends using their entire line to get the intended results. Revtalift Face and Neck Cream is gentle, and has a pleasant texture and fragrance, while helping to smooth imperfections and create more contour to my neckline area.</li>
    <li> This is very thick cream. I thought I was buying an all-day light under make up cream.  That said, this is a really good product.</li>
    <li> Really helps my skin. Also good for keeping moisture in.</li>
    <li> I have used L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al Revitalift  face cream for 10 years. I use this as my morning moisturizer and love the way it makes the skin on my face and neck feel, softer and smoother. It also makes the skin under my eyes appear smoother and not as puffy and throughout the day my skin maintains the same smoothness as when I first applied it in the morning.This is a great product for the price and I would recommend it to anyone, especially to people who are concerned about the aging effects life is having on your skin.</li>
    <li> I use this anti-wrinkle cream and use this everyday.  This is my daytime cream, and it smooths my dry skin and helps relax the lines and wrinkles on my face.</li>
    <li> I approached this lotion with an open mind. I was new to the world of anti-wrinkle lotions, and this was available at the local CVS. My problem was a forehead expression line, and some frown lines on the sides of my mouth. I have combination/oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for a full season, with no results. Typically, I would use it after a zinc wash (which drastically dries out your skin and clears pores...). After putting the lotion on, I would have to wait about 5-10 minutes for the lotion to get absorbed. Even after waiting, it would always leave a greasy, shiny look. One day, while worried that the lotion wasn&#x27;t absorbing into my skin, I used oil-absorbing sheets to see just how much lotion was being left on the surface. After 6 near-transparent sheets made their way to my trash bin, I decided this lotion wasn&#x27;t for me. It was just too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, it didn&#x27;t do a thing about wrinkle protection. My face was more or less the same before/after. I don&#x27;t know where people are getting these amazing results from. Clearly, something here is either drastically wrong, or I somehow managed to spend three months buying the wrong cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for real wrinkle treatment, I would recommend a retinol cream. Revitalift isn&#x27;t even worth the trouble as a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Again product arrived very well packaged. No damage. It arrived on time. Awesome.</li>
    <li> It started working the very first time I used it. Friends and family noticed a difference in only a week.  You can feel and see the difference in your skin over night.  I use this morning and evenings.  Has worked wonders on my neck and upper chest.  Ladies all I can say...give it a try and see if it works as well for you as it has me...I&#x27;m pushing 58 and have been told I look closer to 40.</li>
    <li> It is good for me and I will continue to use it until my skin says it has got enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. You feel and see the difference in your skin in days. I love it and would def buy again.</li>
    <li> Last time I used a L&#x27;Oreal was about 5 years ago - with younger skin so no complain, I guess.  After that I have been pretty much with Kiehl&#x27;s and RoC.  Back to L&#x27;oreal this one, somehow I feel it comes with small particles. and a few times it peels off like srcub masks.  Not sure if it&#x27;s me - using wrong lotion underneath or... just the way this product is.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it worked any more than the the brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I like the feel and texture of it and the price. And it felt good going on. But to me, it was the same as many others I&#x27;ve already purchased.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that I will purchase this brand again.  First time users.</li>
    <li> Will this make a 65 year old wrinkles go away so she looks 30 - Nope but it sure feels good and makes my skin look less dry and wrinkly to the ey</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion for the dry areas on my face, but for the oily areas it made me break out really bad. Yes, I&#x27;m 47 and still deal with occasional breakouts. I would suggest this product for people with dry skin only.</li>
    <li> my wife decides to give 1 star, but i think she may go to extreems. anyway, it is a common kind</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty greasy.  It didn&#x27;t do anything as far as lifting or contouring, and it caused one of the worst break outs I&#x27;ve ever had from a product. My skin is already naturally oily, so that might be the problem.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using if you have oily skin like I do.</li>
    <li> very oily for my skin, would not buy again!</li>
    <li> my wife swears by this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have tried all top brands and nothing works better than RevitaLift for the face and neck. It smooths out fine lines and wrinkles like no others. I have been using it for  over 10 years and nothing compares to it.</li>
    <li> Another great product.. use all the time, very fast shipping</li>
    <li> did see a difference after 4 weeks</li>
    <li> Makes your skin soft and looks radiant.</li>
    <li> A good moisturizer.  Hasn&#x27;t helped my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel the product did anything that I was led to believe.  Probally would try a different product.  It did arrive in a timely manor.</li>
    <li> The product and delivery was as.exact as.described.</li>
    <li> Smelt good, but I saw nothing.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  An excellent cream we shall see as time goes by and will review product after using longer</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time last night before bed.  Within minutes of applying, my face started to feel very irritated and there was an awful burning sensation.  I washed it off right away but this morning I had some peeling in my t-zone area.  My face has never been sensitive but it is on the dry side so I thought this product would help.  I realize everyone is different and this may work great for some but I definitely had a bad reaction to it.</li>
    <li> I love to be outdoors, but that can be hard on my skin.  This product really keeps my skin soft,and helps solve the problems of flaking and redness.  It only takes a little each morning or evening to make a real difference.</li>
    <li> I have used Murad products for years but so expensive.  I have given lots of other products a try and&lt;br /&gt;this one is wonderful.  Compares in my opinion to resurgence line.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Revitalift cream is easy to use and economical.  It doesn&#x27;t require a lot of the product at any one time so I don&#x27;t have to replace it often.  I use it around the neck area primarily.  Coupled with what I view as a healthy life style, I am pleased with the results and will keep it as a mainstay.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say it really prevents wrinkles or a firmer face, though I would like to believe it does!  But the texture is thick and creamy, and it &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; like it&#x27;s doing good things for the skin, so I have to say I like it better than many other face creams.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s best price and good for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and after I finish the jar I will be on the hunt for another moisturizor more suitable for my skin type that I can use during the day. If you have very oily skin this probably won&#x27;t be the lotion for you during the summer months, possibly even winter months but I can&#x27;t tell you for sure since I&#x27;ve only used it recently and it&#x27;s summer now.  A couple of hours after using this lotion during the day, under my make up, you could probably fry eggs on my face. My whole face is shining and I am constantly blotting. It versatile for day or night so the night time isn&#x27;t a problem. I like the texture of it, goes on smooth and the smell is nice, but as I mentioned early it&#x27;s just not working out for me during the day.</li>
    <li> I made the consolidation of three items along with this and I had no problem whatsoever. Everything arrived on time and in good condition. I highly recommend this seller. Thank you very much and very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this daily moisturizer works well for me.  It isn&#x27;t greasy but it covers well and I don&#x27;t have any dry patches.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. Great for middle age skin. Light and not greasy, absorbs quickly into your skin. L&#x27;Oreal products are not expensive and are good quality!</li>
    <li> I am a 52 YO M with little wrinkles under my eyes. I almost used the whole container and can&#x27;t really notice much difference. I would not really recommend it! Gave it 2 stars just for the benefit of the doubt.</li>
    <li> this face cream is light and it feels beautiful on my skin</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery!</li>
    <li> Nice very heavy, I think good for older women who need extra moister.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price.  I would recommend this to friends.  Very thick and a lot of times I dont use it with any cream.</li>
    <li> My husband and family have told me that my skin looks smoother, younger and tighter. I love this product. I actually bought this one and the night cream for my mom.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell - it just has too strong of an odor for me - stronger than other L&#x27;Oreal products I have purchased</li>
    <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, y</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. Not only did it not do anything to improve my skin but it actually seemed to dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Good product for skin, it definitely helps a little it and makes skin appear smoother. Would purchase again and would recommend</li>
    <li> My wife says it is just okay, but each person must decide for themselves. She would not purchase it asgain</li>
    <li> use the moisturizer daily on my skin twice a day. I still use high end cleanser and toner but not high end moisturizer. Love this moisturizer!! Smells good and abdorbs quickly. Light and effective.</li>
    <li> While Revitalift cream reduces the loose skin on my neck and lessens the wrinkles at the corner of my eyes it leaves your skin greasy.&lt;br /&gt;A much better alternative is Revitalift triple action which works better and does not leave you skin greasy. It also spreads easier. The triple action costs almost twice as much but I feel it is worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> OK as a moisturizer but doesn&#x27;t do what it claims. Not worth the money I payed for it. To bad.</li>
    <li> It worked on my raised acne scars and made my face baby soft. However it made my acne so much worse to the point where my face hurt. So I had to switch back to coco butter for now.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a while and generally like it.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this product as well. It does seem to reduce any wrinkles that she has so she ends up looking twenty years younger than her real age.</li>
    <li> it gave me a cystic acne breakout.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for a nice face cream that will keep my face looking young and fresh, smooth, and bright. THIS product, has exceeded my expectations. It goes on soooo silky smooth and is not oily at alllllll!  I have been using it only every morning, and it makes my face feel really good, and smooth, even hours later . I reccommend this especially since it isnt hundreds of dollars and it makes u feel like u did spend a lot on it when you use it. Even under my eyes are tighter, and they look brighter and even really my whole face feels tighter after just a week, I am seeing the one small line I have on my forhead getting less and less visible, so I am happy with this. very much so!  10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging lol : Only thing with this was it came in a box that could fit like 6 of these face creams in their boxes n the one box it came in. It had two bags of air in the box w it so that the little box wouldnt bang around, lol I just thought they could have put the big box to better use and used a little bit more smaller box for this cream. But whatever lol still a 10/10~!</li>
    <li> Value of product is excellent and shipped on time.  Would recommend to a friend.  Don&#x27;t like the required number of words for a review</li>
    <li> After using this wonderfull skin cream for a couple of weeks, it renews the look and feel of my complexion.Every morning I wake  up, my face and neck area have a youthful firmness and radiance. I love it and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel anything difference with this product I only use this on my neck and I only use Olay on my face love the Olay on my face but I needed something more for my neck going to try just plain Lubriderm</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for awhile now.  It has a rich consistency without being greasy.  My skin feels softer and it minimizes fine lines and wrinkles on my face.</li>
    <li> Visible results at a great price!</li>
    <li> Love this anti-wrinkle cream.  The product delivers exactly as it states.  Great product, great manufacturer. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This is a re-order...I used it all and my skin looks great!  I have tried so many other high priced  on TV kits and they don&#x27;t come close</li>
    <li> Good. My wife likes it.</li>
    <li> Not as good for firming as advertised but a great non greasy face cream.</li>
    <li> I was starting to notice some deep set lines on my face. After reading reviews I decided to take a chance on this product. To my surprise it worked very well! For the first month I used a lot at least 2 times a  day. I noticed that lines were alot less visable. I forgot for a few days and then when I remembered to use it I noticed lines had not returned. Now about 2+ months out all deep set and fine lines are gone. I only use very little around my eyes, forehead and around mouth. It feels greasy initially but after a few minutes on your skin it soaks in completely and my skin feels soft and taught. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this product really works. Smell is a bit on the stronger side and I don&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference with wrinkles. I ran out of the product and haven&#x27;t used it in awhile, but may buy it again just to see if I notice anything. Not too hopeful.</li>
    <li> i think it is working i do think it is working i will know so i hope but it dose seem to be working</li>
    <li> Not really impressed  by this product! I expected it to make my skin feel firmer but that didn&#x27;t work I am going back to my old face revitalizer</li>
    <li> This cream feels good when applied.  You don&#x27;t have to put lots on because it works better when applied lightly.  Not sure about the wrinkles yet, but my skin is softer and a lot less dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because my aunt was using it and had great results, I also have other products in the line, thank you.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well, have noticed a difference. Maintains the skin pretty soft. seems to work.  Woukd recommend to a friend,</li>
    <li> I thought it was a very good product.</li>
    <li> okay I have naturally dry and sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t usually breakout so when I do I always know what it&#x27;s from. this cream caused terrible breakouts to my face probably because of the perfume in it . also it didn&#x27;t do ANY firming whatsoever. it smells good though but that&#x27;s it. don&#x27;t waste your money.. ESPECIALLY if you have dry and sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Nice fragrance and feel.</li>
    <li> Has smoothed crocodile skin on my neck but not seeing any firming for Saggy neck</li>
    <li> I have tried this product for the first time, I have been using it for about 1 1/2 months. I have noticed a change in the feel on the skin on my face, much softer and a bit tighter. I have not noticed a vanishing of the wrinkles. Personally I believe that just about every product out there will do little in actual disappearance of wrinkles, but other than that, I do recommend the product since it does improve the quality of the skin on my face</li>
    <li> Heavy perfume in a face cream is the sign of a junk product.  I have sensitive skin, so obviously this creates an issue for me.  However even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, why would you want perfume in your face cream?  If you like to wear fragrances (which I don&#x27;t because they give me headaches) then this would only interfere with them.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years...</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Really hydrates my skin as well as lifts it.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizing face cream, without the very expensive price.  Our skin needs extra help as we get older to help with the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Anti-wrinkle creams only work if you start using them in your 20&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m 60 and there&#x27;s little hope for me except plastic surgery.  My skin feels soft using this product, but wrinkles are still there and visible.</li>
    <li> Bought this to work on my neck which I have recently noticed has thin lines forming.  Have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have noticed a dramatic improvement in appearance.  Have also been applying it to a &amp;#34;frown&amp;#34; line on my forehead.  My friends call it a laugh line being that they do not see my frown.  Have noticed that this line is also less noticeable.  Only reason I gave it four stars rather than 5 is that the results only seem to last for the 12 hours that it was applied.  If I forget to apply it I can certainly tell right away that it was not used,</li>
    <li> Did not see much difference. I decided to change my review, since I am not much for using creams, I forget to use them consistently as directed, which may account for my decision. I want to be fair to the company and those who read this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Nice thick cream. Goes on smooth and easy. Makes my face so soft and noticed a difference the first time I applied it! I apply it first thing in the morning and before I go to bed. Make sure your face is freshly washed and dried!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected GOOD product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been writing this a lot, but this winter (2013-14) has been tough on my skin. I am a very young looking 66.. people think I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, early 50&#x27;s (really!), but my skin was getting all flaky and was losing its firmness and I was looking and feeling old. I searched Amazon for L&#x27;Oreal products, read reviews and found this. I have been using this product for over a for a month, and I really believe this works just as stated, at least for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have less lines, my skin looks plumper, firmer, my waddle (that ugly flesh on my neck) is much smoother and also firmer. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed this was possible, but I have always trusted L&#x27;Oreal with my facial skin care. I had run out of my last product from them, not this, the one for Mature skin, and was looking for something different to use.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have found this! I am using it in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Daily Serum. After I clean my face with L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect for Mature Skin Rich Restorative Cream Cleanser, with gentle exfoliating micro beads (it leaves your skin dewy soft and moist), I pat it dry and put the Daily Serum on and my skin drinks it in like a sponge. Then to hold in the moisture all day and keep my skin firm,  I use L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face &amp; Neck Contour Cream then, L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream which has done wonders for my eyelids. They were droopy, and now they are not, honest! I have eyelids again. Amazing. I wish I had taken pictures to show you the difference, especially with my eyes. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;Ladies this line works, give it a try, you just might be amazed like I was, and it didn&#x27;t take a month for me, it happened in less than two weeks, maybe because my skin was so dry...but these results never happened with anything else; even high-end products.&lt;br /&gt;Love you L&#x27;Oreal, thank you for your wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve tried several over the years and this one works.  However, you must use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, only bought one jar.</li>
    <li> Love this skin cream  astounding price from amazon ..they have everything at amazing prices</li>
    <li> I think the price is right for what you get but don&#x27;t expect miracles if you&#x27;re aging--just drink lots of water!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream specifically for my neck.  I can see a visible difference after just one week.  It&#x27;s nice to find a product that actually works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it does work and I am particular about what I use on my face..  I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and always leaves my skin feeling good.  It hasn&#x27;t performed miracles but it has helped and I appreciate that.  Very little scent which is always a plus and a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been coming back to this as my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; face cream for a long time and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Great Price, and love the product</li>
    <li> Feels like there are granules in it... I hope it is not old... Hope it works! Looking forward to using it!</li>
    <li> It is okay but nothing exceptional.  Depends on what you are looking for I would guess.  It is a good moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t do much for my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I do not magically look 20, but I have been using this on my neck for a week, and the skin is definitely smoother. Also, the lines on my neck are less noticeable and less rough.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had me get this since she is afraid to use her card online.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve felt around all over her after she uses the stuff and it does seem to softener her up some. However , that is just her skin. Her head needs something too. She mixes this with Amazon CERAVE cream and she talks to her girlfriends about it. I guess it works for her. I might smear some on her noggin&#x27; while she is sleeping to see if it works up there too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k. ; does provide moisture without being a grease mess or causing enlarged pores. But Does Not show any form of lifting.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful , I have been using it for years.  Your delivery service is amazing when you say a certain date you mean it.  Thank you again.</li>
    <li> I stop using this, for a cheap brand. But am glad am back to L&#x27;Oreal. This is the best brand</li>
    <li> Received box crumpled, mailed in plastic envelope.  Although product was in tact.  Too greasy for my face, so only put it on my neck.  Did not notice any firming affect. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> A woman regardless of age should maintain a daily facial regime.  Although I do not have wrinkles, I think it is very important to start early and maintain your appearance in preparation for years to come.  I have used many L’Oreal products in the past, especially in the product lines of make-up, hair care as well as their other innovative products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to introduce my skin to a new brand of L’Oreal products, and was surprised at appearance of my skin and firmness, the results are practically astounding for the little period of time I have started using this product.  The Revita-Life Anti-wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream has shown me an appearance of firmer skin, the moisturizer in this product is absolutely perfect.  This is the first time in years, that I did not have to continually moisturize my face during the day, once I applied this cream.  It does not have an oily or greasy feel to your face or appearance during the day.  In fact I checked my face numerous amount of times to see if my face had an oily or greasy glow, and it was not visible, although my face felt and was moisturized throughout the day.  I have seen great changes with the Stimuplex and Pro-Retinol A which is included in this product.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is actively working on a facial regime, and wants a product that gives firmness and a youthful appearance when used on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered on time, the price is reasonable, and L’Oreal has delivered everything that a consumer is looking for in this product.  The company that advertised this product gave a complete and accurate description of the product they are selling to Amazon customers.  I am extremely happy with this product, and definitely will keep on my list of products to purchase for my facial regime now and in the future.</li>
    <li> I went through an entire container and didn&#x27;t see any difference.MaybeI should use it longer, but after a little over a month I couldn&#x27;t see any improvement. I sleep on my side which crushes my boobs together, and also creates wrinkles on my chest and neck. I was really hoping this would work, but I guess I will have to keep looking for somthing better. As for a regular lotion though, it felt nice to put on and my chest felt moisturized.</li>
    <li> This product felt good on the face however I was of the opinion it would help to remove wrinkles and firm up the skin along the jaw line.  This is the same story most cosmetic companies claim.  They don&#x27;t work.  I was a person in the sun quite a bit when I was younger and therefore have some wrinkles on my face.  Oh well........</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s too early to tell if I like The Revitalift yet.  I do know it feels greasy to me. Doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as some of the other reviews had said.  This could be due to my oily skin though.</li>
    <li> Getting older means getting wrinkles and no cream, or lotion will stop it but this actually helped. Though it leaves your skin feeling slightly sticky.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE CREAM IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL GOOD.  I WAS HOPING I&#x27;D LOOK 20 YEARS YOUNGER LOL</li>
    <li> This is my go too face and neck cream. It does everything it says. Softens, firming on face and neck, plus spf support.</li>
    <li> Start using it under my puffed eye. It seems to work pretty well I probably will order it again.</li>
    <li> work great and a good price too thanks</li>
    <li> it  works very well it deserves 5 stars</li>
    <li> Im pleased with this facial cream. I am also glad that I got the item at a reasonable price. I feels good on my skin</li>
    <li> This is a product I can count on for the moisturizers needed each day. This is a very comfortable cream and not at all &amp;#34;greasy.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> i am over 60 with a few fine lines.  i have used this for 3 weeks every day and i can honestly say i really see a difference.  this jar will not last for more then 5 weeks but this price is fantastic and if it works who cares.  i use elizabeth ardens cleanser also and it is fantastic.  i would highly recommend that you buy this.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to some sunscreens and moisturizers so this may not be a problem with most people. I had recently started using the Neutragena Wave on an occasional basis and felt my skin was a little dry and needed a moisturizer. Before putting this stuff on, I had noticed the skin on my forehead was looking better than it had in a long time - not a hint of a blemish. After one use, the Revitalift caused my forehead to break out like a teenager&#x27;s. I will never use this on my face again and regret the purchase. I will use it on my neck and upper chest where I never break out so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste. If you don&#x27;t ever break out, it might be a great product but not for me.</li>
    <li> This cream is the bast been using it for years</li>
    <li> No one has called attention to the totally overpowering smell of this product. This was my first L&#x27;oreal night cream purchase. I put it on and immediately washed it off. The excessive smell does nothing to add to the effectiveness of the cream and I don&#x27;t understand why they add so much of it. I wish this weren&#x27;t the case as most reviews say it is a nice cream. I will return to Olay and Burts Bees products.</li>
    <li> I was in an accident with alot of facial damage and also caused a great deal of aging and it works great! I use it everyday with another product called Youth code.</li>
    <li> Not sure it removes wrinkles or tightens skin, but it does keep my face smooth and would buy it again just for that.  I found Loreal products to be better than other products, but haven&#x27;t found the best one yet that will really tighten my skin/neck area and remove wrinkles, and have used many different products to date.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 73years old, and after using this product, I looked 72. It&#x27;s a miracle cream. Buy it now.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few facial crèmes that I truly enjoy using because it&#x27;s so light. I don&#x27;t like gobbing my face with thick lotions.</li>
    <li> I saw no improvement!</li>
    <li> I’m seeing a slight difference, but that’s about it.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how all of these users have seen results. I applied this cream underneath and around my eye area BOTH morning AND night for two months straight and absolutely have seen no results. even though this product is fairly cheap, it is definitely not worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the first stages of trying it, and so far, I can truly say that I like it.  The price was fantastic.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Little heavy, use as a night cream.  Smell reminded me of the old Pond&#x27;s cold cream?  But overall was happy with the product.  Did not cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> i try this for only one week an i start to breakup not for me ,maybe is the perfume on it</li>
    <li> Very nice will buy again</li>
    <li> I liked it...just started using it so don&#x27;t know yet if any significant results</li>
    <li> I am 45.  I have been using Revitalift for maybe 3 years now before I put on my makeup.  My mother used to use Oil of Olay, but when I tried it, it made my skin itchy.  Other creams felt heavy.  This one feels like, but your skin feels hydrated at the same time.  I have tried the Revitalift with sunscreen, and do use it in the summer, but it can make your skin sting a little.  All in all, I love it.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune for a good face cream. I ordered it again because I was pleased with the way my skin looks. I can certainly see a difference in the fine lines. I have tried a number of high end creams that promise miraculous results, but they didn&#x27;t work as well as Revitalift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the point is of putting 18 spf sunscreen in this. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it out of the house in the daytime. The scent is really strong and really cosmetic-y. Forget a kiss on the cheek. Anyone would think they were kissing their grandma. You&#x27;d think by now they could make a product like this without such a strong scent or unscented. It seems to help a little with wrinkles and skin tone.</li>
    <li> have purchased this product before and I like the way it works. Is a much more inexpensive alternative to the more pricey products you find in local stores</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it works well for my skin type. Tried others on and off, but none compared to Loreal. Trying to become a smarter shopper and budget, decided to see if Amazon carried this product and at what cost. Typically, I purchase this at Walgreen&#x27;s or Walmart but Amazon&#x27;s price beat both of them. Yeahhhhh!!!  LOL  I will order up ahead on this item and have them in stock now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love how it does not feel greasy and truly makes my skin feel tighter and more vibrant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now. It works great! It was shipped to me very fast.</li>
    <li> I had very few wrinkles around my eyes so I decided to try this to get rid of them.  Within a few weeks I had a LOT of wrinkles around my eyes and especially under my eyes!  I have no idea what in the world happened.  My mother hardly has any wrinkles and my sister (who is 13 years older than me) doesn&#x27;t either. I don&#x27;t get what happened at all but I&#x27;m very upset about the results.</li>
    <li> There were many positive comments about this product.  I have been using it two times a day for several weeks and did not get the results that was expected.It did not work for me. I am going to try another product because it has a good rating.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time that I gave a poor rating on any product. I buy a lot from Amazon and have been very happy with the products that I  order.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a very good product you can feel and see the difference when  you use it .</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see that it is doing anything it says on the package.  Do I have to use it for 6 months or longer, because just 1 month isn&#x27;t enough to do much change.  For me, anyways...</li>
    <li> I wholeheartedly recommend all L&#x27;Oreal products for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin. If I run out, my skin immediately shows that it &#x27;misses&#x27; the product. This particular item is best for me. My skin is visibly &#x27;smoother,&#x27; i.e., the lines in my face are much less prominent. I look young for my age, but when I look in the mirror, I&#x27;m very aware of the tell tale indications of my actual age, the things others don&#x27;t notice as much as I.&lt;br /&gt;My local chain drugstore has an incomplete supply of L&#x27;Oreal products; I never know what I&#x27;ll need that they won&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;I also save money when I purchase from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My only slight &#x27;complaint&#x27; would be that the Amazon products are in slightly smaller amounts than I&#x27;m used to, and that the packaging implies otherwise; the packaging is significantly &#x27;larger&#x27; than it needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I last purchased from Amazon, the 3 items I selected came from 3 different suppliers, so I paid more for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;But these are minor considerations, given that I love/need L&#x27;Oreal and can&#x27;t afford the pricier brands. I know these things can be immensely more expensive. L&#x27;Oreal isn&#x27;t cheap, but I can manage, and I have complete confidence, especially with the &#x27;Revitalift&#x27; items. I&#x27;ll never change, even if my acting career propels me into another level of affordability.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years.  Absolutely love it and my youthful skin.  Amazon has it for 1/2 the price of the stores.</li>
    <li> so far my skin likes this product, although I have not seen significant difference with the wrinkles. I will see how it works in winter.</li>
</ol>
