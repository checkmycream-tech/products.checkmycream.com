      <li>This is a beneficial conditioner that has provided good results for my fine hair.</li>

      <li>The first time I used it was a drizzly, dreary day, and even after being out in the rain a couple of times, my hair still looked great.  </li>
      <li>This one does moisture my hair more than the frizz control one</li>
      <li>It smells nice and leaves my hair looking and feeling fantastic.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I want most from this product.</li>
      <li>So, I sort of thought that the matching conditioner might be where the scalp &#x27;magic&#x27; resided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can do better than the price at the time of this review if you shop around for a bit.</li>
      <li>I am not even sure how they&#x27;d keep it from mixing since conditioner is a lot more liquidy than say...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- LOVE the scent.</li>
      <li>It works almost as well as my favorite salon conditioners.</li>
      <li>I have experimented with more of them than I can count.</li>
      <li>It looks shiny and it feels healthy.</li>
      <li>I think this is meant for more severe dryness than just winter dryness</li>
      <li>I also need to experiment with the appropriate after shampoo leave in creme.  </li>
      <li>For the expense, you would expect more from this conditioner.</li>
      <li>This conditioner also has a nice scent that stays with my hair even though it rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very clean and fruity</li>
      <li>but this conditioner kept my hair soft and nice to the touch!</li>
      <li>This product smells nice and doesn&#x27;t feel really greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it to get rid of tangles and smooth my hair.</li>
      <li>, I think this conditioner could be fantastic for those with genuinely damaged hair.</li>
      <li>had a good effect on body and retained my hair&#x27;s natural waves.</li>
      <li>The lower mid-part of my hair experienced less in the way of smoothing, but that&#x27;s no surprise as that is there is greater volume and application tends to focus on the ends.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been lucky to find a couple of conditioners that do a good job with my hair and Clear is one of them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very familiar with the &amp;#34;Clear&amp;#34; line of products and find them to be at the higher end of consumer-level (as opposed to salon-grade) hair products.</li>
      <li>After use, my hair does look and feel clean.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean.</li>
      <li>It did an especially good job with hair near my scalp - the smoothing was nearly as good as more expensive salon-quality treatments.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this is a very good conditioner, it probably is best on thick or more coarse dry</li>
      <li>If I more meticulously applied conditioner evenly, I may get better overall results.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very pleased with the results of the two products combined and</li>
      <li>In my opinion, this is a good conditioner for me to use in the summer when my hair because dry from the sun.</li>
      <li>This conditioner got it feeling very soft and looking remarkably healthy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s the million dollar question certainly worth a ponder.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve liked using this Clear Scalp Intense Hydration Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the clear hair products.</li>
      <li>I love just about every product that the Clear line puts out.</li>
      <li>I do not suspect I&#x27;ll be able to use this duo in the summer, because the climate where I live gets pretty humid.  </li>
      <li>With this conditioner I have found that it&#x27;s best for me to use it every, while only shampooing every other day.  </li>
      <li>just don&#x27;t think this is the right conditioner for me.  </li>
      <li>Clear scalp and hair intense hydration worked well with my 4a hair, leaving it soft and moisturized after I used it, and with a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>and I was able to easily run a comb through my wet hair in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Conditioner, along with the coordinating shampoo, for several weeks and am really happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had minimal benefits from some of the more inexpensive conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried, but this one produces pretty good results.</li>
      <li>We tried the Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration SHAMPOO and it was okay.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, affordable product for dry hair.</li>
      <li>this product, my hair feels very soft and stays wonderfully smooth.  </li>
      <li>This is a very reasonably priced product that serves well as a conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t see much reason to think of this as anything other than a good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does feel a little like it&#x27;s coating the hair, but in this case, that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
      <li>in all, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the entire Clear line and this one as well.</li>
      <li>conditioner was great for my guys because they have short hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this conditioner for long haired gals or guys.</li>
      <li>If you treat it as such, without expecting any form of intensity, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
      <li>It smells so fresh and really gets your hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The aroma is pleasing and the feel of the product is of a richness found in higher grade conditioners.</li>
      <li>The only point which I wish were better was shine enhancement.</li>
      <li>An extra plus is how shiny and healthy looking my hair is after using this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with similar priced conditioners.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed many of Clear Scalp and Hair&#x27;s other products and figured I&#x27;d get more of the same here.</li>
      <li>In fact, I think for my long hair needed something more.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice and is a thick, fairly rich formula.</li>
      <li>I am a tremendous fan of Clear products.</li>
      <li>The product left my hair feeling fuller and easy to style.</li>
      <li>My hair has more bounce and shine than normal even after blow drying and using the flat iron.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say if it hydrates the scalp as I did not notice any difference.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t experience much in the way of flyaway hair.</li>
      <li>So, I decided I would give this one a try since it is scalp and hair intense hydration...</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I really like this conditioner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although this conditioner dispenses in a creamy ribbon like a lotion, it conditions very well</li>
      <li>But is it an intense one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, after adding the Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration CONDITIONER to my shower regime I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.  </li>
      <li>The smell is barely noticeable so that is an okay thing about this product, but overall, this conditioner doesn&#x27;t do what it says it is going to do.</li>
      <li>I was a bit hesitant to try this because I have long fine hair and sometimes hydrating conditioners</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a tremendous fan of Clear products. I have experimented with more of them than I can count. Now, this new incarnation is a bit perplexing. It contains cactus extract. Could this be the reason why the scent is a little like aloe? And it has a somewhat greenish tint?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in tandem with the matching shampoo. The final results were a little \\&quot;over-moisturizerd.\\&quot; My hair was slightly \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; looking (I honestly do mean \\&quot;slightly\\&quot;). And, it had a stringy quality that I usually do not see with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as packaging, I love the \\&quot;upside down\\&quot; bottle ... especially, with a thick conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to guess, I think this conditioner could be fantastic for those with genuinely damaged hair. For me, who still needs a touch of moisture as this harsh winters melts away, I think it was just too much.</li>
    <li> After using this, my shoulder length hair is tangle-free when I get out of the shower, and if I pat dry it carefully with a towel, my hair is easy to wet comb afterward. On the other hand, I do think I have to wash my hair more often, a day sooner than I usually do, so maybe it is putting too much hydration into my hair, but that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> Great consistency!&lt;br /&gt;Great rinseability!&lt;br /&gt;Great smell!&lt;br /&gt;Great price!&lt;br /&gt;I would spend $6 for this.&lt;br /&gt;Always get up side down bottles.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great conditioner and worked well with my hair. I color it so it can get dry but this conditioner kept my hair soft and nice to the touch! That&#x27;s what I want most from this product.</li>
    <li> The product description says this has \\&quot;a white stripe of deep hydrating treatment and an aqua stripe infused with cactus extract.\\&quot; There were no stripes in my product, although there was a slight bluish tinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner seems to work about the same as most other conditioners. It goes on as a creamy lotion and rinses out leaving no discernable residue. There were fewer tangles in my hair than when I do not use conditioner, so in that sense it works.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that falls to the middle of my back.  I am always looking for conditioning products that make my hair manageable without the greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does a fair job of that.  It&#x27;s got a very pleasant smell and is at a great price point.  After use, my hair does look and feel clean. No greasy feeling whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that this stuff is pretty thick and I have to use quite a bit of it to get my wet hair to a point that I can put a pick through it while in the shower.  Once I&#x27;m out of the shower and my hair has been towel dried or blown dry...it&#x27;s still kind of hard to get a pick through.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with similar priced conditioners.</li>
    <li> Previously before I started using this, I was using the Clear Frizz control and it wasn&#x27;t helping with frizz and it was actually drying out my scalp. So, I decided I would give this one a try since it is scalp and hair intense hydration...well after two weeks of using this,with the shampoo, it has not hydrated my scalp one bit! It is still dry. I have never had this problem with any other brands.This one does moisture my hair more than the frizz control one and I do have less frizz than I had with the frizz control. But that is it. The smell is barely noticeable so that is an okay thing about this product, but overall, this conditioner doesn&#x27;t do what it says it is going to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked using this Clear Scalp Intense Hydration Conditioner. It works well with dry, over worked hair to make it soft and manageable. An extra plus is how shiny and healthy looking my hair is after using this conditioner. I&#x27;ve only had minimal benefits from some of the more inexpensive conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried, but this one produces pretty good results. It smells nice and is a thick, fairly rich formula. It doesn&#x27;t make hair feel heavy or weighed down and produces nice results. My hair has more bounce and shine than normal even after blow drying and using the flat iron. This is a beneficial conditioner that has provided good results for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> The description copied from above says &amp;#34;Clear scalp and hair has a dual-action formulation: a white stripe of deep hydrating treatment, and an aqua stripe infused with cactus extract.&amp;#34;  So I was expecting some aquafresh toothpaste looking substance to come out of the bottle.  But my conditioner was all the same color.  Perhaps it got mixed in shipping?  I am not even sure how they&#x27;d keep it from mixing since conditioner is a lot more liquidy than say... toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway the smell was pleasant to me.  Going on it seemed like normal conditioner but after rinsing it out my hair felt greasy and heavy.  It didn&#x27;t look greasy it just felt heavier and weighed down to me.  Could get a comb through it with ease so no complaints there.  Even after the shower my hair continued to have a weighty feel.  Definitely no frizzy... but I lost some of my volume I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t think this is the right conditioner for me.  I think this is meant for more severe dryness than just winter dryness and I was a little put off because I was expecting a dual color conditioner based on the description the company gave and what I got was something different.  Perhaps after a few more uses the &amp;#34;dual&amp;#34; color will come out... but then that makes me wonder how they can ensure that you are getting the &amp;#34;correct mix&amp;#34; of each color (if there is two colors in there).  It kind of seems like hype to me.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used in a while for my over-processed hair. I have had it dyed in strange colors for a while (hot pink), which means stripping it with bleach and re-applying these short-term dyes every couple of weeks or so. That does a lot of damage, unfortunately, which means I have to do all sorts of treatments to prevent my hair from looking like neon-colored hay. This conditioner got it feeling very soft and looking remarkably healthy. I was not very familiar with this brand before, but I&#x27;ll look out for it now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the accompanying shampoo with and without conditioner, and can tell you this conditioner makes a big difference to my final results. I&#x27;m careful about hair products because I have very long hair and I have to take good care of it or it looks shaggy and unkempt. This product smells nice and doesn&#x27;t feel really greasy or oily. It rinses out very clean--which made me think at first that it had all rinsed off or something, but once my hair dried out I really noticed how soft and smooth my hair was. And my husband noticed the same things and wondered what I&#x27;d done differently! Definitely going to get this conditioner again. My only real complaint about it is that its container is almost identical to the shampoo, so someone with very poor vision might have trouble picking up the right bottle in the shower. They have differently-shaped tops and sit upside-down, so after a while I got the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the [[ASIN:B00HRQY5JW Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Shampoo]] along with the [[ASIN:B00HNKRWI8 Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Conditioner]].  My hair is mid-back length, naturally curly and also color treated.  With this conditioner I have found that it&#x27;s best for me to use it every, while only shampooing every other day.  I have noticed a bit less frizz in my hair, which is most likely from my hair being less dried out.  This conditioner also has a nice scent that stays with my hair even though it rinses clean.  Overall I am very pleased with the results of the two products combined and the price isn&#x27;t so high that I can&#x27;t afford for it to be my regular brand.</li>
    <li> Clear scalp and hair intense hydration worked well with my 4a hair, leaving it soft and moisturized after I used it, and with a pleasant smell. I will use this again in the future.</li>
    <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t care for it. For the expense, you would expect more from this conditioner. It seems no better than cheap products like Suave or Tresseme.</li>
    <li> Even though my hair is short I have to be careful because I live with well water.  Ugh.  Conditioning it can be a challenge.  I need something that isn&#x27;t oily, but conditions my hair so that I can brush it when I get out of the shower.  I don&#x27;t like heavy conditioners.  This one does a good job of it.  It conditions my hair without weighing it down and making it oily too quickly.  It does a good job all throughout my hair:  roots to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been lucky to find a couple of conditioners that do a good job with my hair and Clear is one of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Conditioner, along with the coordinating shampoo, for several weeks and am really happy with it.  My hair is long and thick, but also very fine.  I have to blow dry my hair to avoid a frizzy mess, but on humid or rainy days it often becomes frizzy quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, my hair feels very soft and stays wonderfully smooth.  The first time I used it was a drizzly, dreary day, and even after being out in the rain a couple of times, my hair still looked great.  I am very happy with how this shampoo and conditioner work for me.  It smells nice and leaves my hair looking and feeling fantastic.</li>
    <li> product as described--shipped in 2 days</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed many of Clear Scalp and Hair&#x27;s other products and figured I&#x27;d get more of the same here. I did, as this conditioner is a quality product at a great price. But is it an intense one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the million dollar question certainly worth a ponder. The simple answer is no. This product is a conditioner. It isn&#x27;t a deep conditioner and I didn&#x27;t see much reason to think of this as anything other than a good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does that matter? Sort of, but not really. This is a very reasonably priced product that serves well as a conditioner. If you treat it as such, without expecting any form of intensity, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> This stuffs smells awesome. I loved it. It feels great to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it left my hair really weird. It felt soft but dry. It was so soft, it didn&#x27;t do anything. It left my hair flat and un-styleable. It wasn&#x27;t shiny.  It was just this weird flat lifeless mess. I tried it with and without the shampoo. Both ways weren&#x27;t great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this on its own as a co-wash. It washed out nicely. But my hair was just limp.</li>
    <li> I really like Clear Scalp products, especially their  [[ASIN:B007RTR8UM CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B007RTR8AC CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]. I was a bit hesitant to try this because I have long fine hair and sometimes hydrating conditioners leave my hair flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this conditioner dispenses in a creamy ribbon like a lotion, it conditions very well and I was able to easily run a comb through my wet hair in the shower.  I like its fresh and subtle flowery fragrance and that it left my hair very soft and somewhat bouncy when dry. I do have wavy hair normally and this did not weigh my hair down. I can&#x27;t really say if it hydrates the scalp as I did not notice any difference. Nevertheless, I really like this conditioner. In my opinion, this is a good conditioner for me to use in the summer when my hair because dry from the sun.</li>
    <li> This is a high end conditioner. The container is professional grade and stands up on the end with the dispenser so the product is always at the ready to use.  The aroma is pleasing and the feel of the product is of a richness found in higher grade conditioners. It is easy to apply, feels good on the scalp and rinses off well.  The product left my hair feeling fuller and easy to style. I used it after shampooing with another product by Clear.  Hair and scalp felt good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m putting the shampoo and conditioner in the same review, which means I will copy this to the conditioner review, because I would never use them separately.  I have extremely dry hair in the winter, and have found this to be a blessing.  I can wear my long hair down after using this, without a lot of embarrassment.  It does feel a little like it&#x27;s coating the hair, but in this case, that&#x27;s a good thing.  I like the little symbol on the bottle - it&#x27;s a cactus, but it also appears to be a hair strand being coated with moisturizer protection. And we all know that cactus, which is supposedly an ingredient in this shampoo, puts up with a lot of dry air!  I do not suspect I&#x27;ll be able to use this duo in the summer, because the climate where I live gets pretty humid.  I also need to experiment with the appropriate after shampoo leave in creme.  But these are minor points in my case. This shampoo might just help me get through next winter without drastically cutting it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t like when the shampoo and conditional are in the exact same style bottle because int he shower with water in the eyes it can be hard to know which one to grab first. But in this case, the bottle sits well either right-side-up or up-side-down. I just put the conditioner up-side-down and I don&#x27;t get confused.</li>
    <li> We tried the Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration SHAMPOO and it was okay. Cleaned my hair well, smelled nice, but didn&#x27;t leave my scalp feeling better. So, I sort of thought that the matching conditioner might be where the scalp &#x27;magic&#x27; resided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after adding the Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration CONDITIONER to my shower regime I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.  In fact, I think for my long hair needed something more.  It wasn&#x27;t left soft, and it wasn&#x27;t easy to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner was great for my guys because they have short hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this conditioner for long haired gals or guys.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to just about every shampoo &amp; conditioner that I&#x27;ve tried over the last decade or so.  One of the very few that I&#x27;ve tried that I can use without itching intensely is Clear, which I discovered a couple of years ago when practically at my wits end.  (I had resorted to the baking soda \\&quot;wash\\&quot;.)  As my hair is rather dry of late, I had high hopes for this [[ASIN:B00HNKRWI8 Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Conditioner]] - until I tried it.  It did make my hair manageable and less dry but my scalp still hasn&#x27;t recovered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - If you&#x27;re using Clear because it is non-irritating to your scalp like I&#x27;ve been, do be aware that this may not have the same non-irritating properties.  Otherwise, does a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo with the conditioner for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- LOVE the scent. It&#x27;s very clean and fruity&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves my hair soft and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;- I feel that this product makes my hair appear healthier and a bit shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not a con on the product itself, but packaging.  These bottles are not sealed off in plastic bags when shipped so once in awhile the shampoo or conditioner will open up during delivery and then you get a box full of shampoo covered items.</li>
    <li> The wife loves it.  She says it one of the best hydrating conditioners she&#x27;s ever used... and she has a lot of hair.  She should know.</li>
    <li> I love the clear hair products. This conditioner works great with other shampoos but works especially well with the same shampoo product. It smells so fresh and really gets your hair soft and smooth.I&#x27;m very particular about my hair products; this is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very familiar with the &amp;#34;Clear&amp;#34; line of products and find them to be at the higher end of consumer-level (as opposed to salon-grade) hair products. I always rate conditioner on several points - shine and body enhancement, styling effects, ease of combing out hair, scent, frizz control/smoothing of flyaway hair, and price. Since products affect hair differently based on hair type, I will say that I have very long, thick, wavy hair, and that it has some shine, but because I&#x27;m nearly 50, it is getting duller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This had a good effect on body and retained my hair&#x27;s natural waves. It did well with controlling frizz and split ends and I didn&#x27;t experience much in the way of flyaway hair. It did an especially good job with hair near my scalp - the smoothing was nearly as good as more expensive salon-quality treatments. The lower mid-part of my hair experienced less in the way of smoothing, but that&#x27;s no surprise as that is there is greater volume and application tends to focus on the ends. If I more meticulously applied conditioner evenly, I may get better overall results. This did not weigh down or flatten my hair, though since I have so much hair, it would take a pretty heavy formula to do that. The only point which I wish were better was shine enhancement. It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything on that front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the entire Clear line and this one as well. At present, however, this is being sold for $5.79 on Amazon, but you can find the same size at Walmart for $4.98. You can do better than the price at the time of this review if you shop around for a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for anything that can give my chemically dried out baby fine hair a moisture boost.&lt;br /&gt;While this is a very good conditioner, it probably is best on thick or more coarse dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;On me, it helped get tangles out, and initially felt &#x27;slick&#x27;, but after 24 hours my hair was back to feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I am mildly impressed by this product. It is very lightweight and does a decent job adding moisture without making your hair feel weighed down and oily.  I have a very sensitive scalp, and it did not seem to irritate it like some conditioners do.  The scent was mild enough that I did not even notice it. I would rate it as a decent conditioner but not remember-able, or anything that I would go out of my way to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love just about every product that the Clear line puts out. I used this conditioner along with the coordinating shampoo and I was very happy with the results. My hair feels clean. It looks shiny and it feels healthy. The price is great. And the quality is definitley comparable to the overpriced salon products. Once again, I am very happy with this line of hair care products!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair that tends to be dry. I have used several Clear shampoos and conditioners, and this one is one of my favorites. The scent is nice and I don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it to get rid of tangles and smooth my hair. It works almost as well as my favorite salon conditioners. The bottle is well designed and doesn&#x27;t leak. This is a nice, affordable product for dry hair.</li>
