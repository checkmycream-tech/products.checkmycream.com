      <li>I don&#x27;t like using just anything to clean my face.</li>
      <li>i have used them and they make my face feel so clean...</li>
      <li>The pads a big and priced reasonably good for what you receive.  </li>
      <li>This is a much appreciated addition to inventory of things that make my life as easy as one would like to have it.</li>
      <li>The lather is plentiful and the scent is subtle and very pleasant.</li>

      <li>I like the idea of a fresh pad for each use.</li>
      <li>They leave my skin feeling soft and clean!</li>
      <li>The rough side of the pads gives gentle exfoliation and the liquid cleanser on the pads does a great job of giving my facial skin a fresh, clean surface.  </li>
      <li>These will  exfoliate skin, but are very gentle.</li>
      <li>The only reason why I deducted a star is because it&#x27;s great they are large, but I feel like I&#x27;m throwing away a lot of product because there is still a lot of cleanser left in the pad after use.  </li>
      <li>It is hot here</li>
      <li>Will order more again next year.</li>
      <li>As a person who depends a lot on external sources for my professional fulfillment, I am very satisfied.</li>

      <li>My face always feels clean &amp; clear.</li>
      <li>Good to use prior to shaving facial hair.</li>
      <li>I use many different types of face washes from high end to drug store</li>
      <li>I certainly hope Aveeno hasn&#x27;t discontinued these.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Well, it was a bit too much for my skin.</li>
      <li>These pads work without damaging your skin no matter how much pressure you apply.</li>
      <li>I tend not to use the whole pad.</li>

      <li>i started seeing and feeling a difference in only a few day :))</li>
      <li>So many claim that they won&#x27;t be overly drying to your face, but then they are (and they seem to stress my skin out and make it over-produce oil, so it goes from tight and dry to super-shiny oily in a couple of hours).</li>
      <li>Trust me, a half of a pad is plenty or use a whole pad and and cleanse your hands for gentle exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Great product and hard to find in stores lately.</li>
      <li>I use the entire Aveeno postively radiant line, as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my parents are old and one has had some strokes which means he is limited on day to day things that are simple like washing your face...i bought these for my parents and they said it is easier to wash their faces...perfect!  i have used them and they make my face feel so clean...i love this aveeno active cleansing pads...i will get this again.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years and I am 57 years old now! Good to use prior to shaving facial hair.</li>
    <li> You actually use this on a wet face, and it lathers up.  I thought this was meant to be a face wipe.  Even though this isn&#x27;t what I thought it was, I still liked it.  It has a pleasant scent, it made my skin soft, and it wasn&#x27;t over-drying.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel very clean and  fresh.  I like the idea of a fresh pad for each use.</li>
    <li> I am a 28 year old female and have oily, acne-prone skin. I have tried TONS of different face washes and none even come close to this one. So many claim that they won&#x27;t be overly drying to your face, but then they are (and they seem to stress my skin out and make it over-produce oil, so it goes from tight and dry to super-shiny oily in a couple of hours). This one is truly not drying, but I also find that my face NEVER gets as oily as it used to, even after 24 hours. So somehow these cleansing pads have brought balance to my skin, no more crazy oil slick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, the best pore cleansing I got was from using abrasive scrubs, but I still found that my nose would get bumpy by the end of the day. With these cleansing pads, I get a full 24 hours of clean, SOFT, smooth skin. My skin both LOOKS and FEELS so wonderfully CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is so great at CLEANING my face and pores, it helps control my acne as well. I used to use benzoyl peroxide to keep my acne at bay. I simply do not need it (nor its drying and bleaching side effects) anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, these cleansing pads definitely help to even out my skin tone and fade acne scars. Even after just a couple uses, I could already tell that my complexion looked brighter, and it has stayed that way with continued use. What&#x27;s neat is that I can actually see some of my freckles again. They used to be so hidden by clogged pores, acne, and red/uneven skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two side notes:&lt;br /&gt;1) I have tried almost all the other products in the Positively Radiant line and haven&#x27;t been nearly as impressed with any of the others. Most notably, the other two face washes (scrub and cleanser) are horrible compared to these cleansing pads, and the daily moisturizers are so-so and seem to cause some acne and oiliness for me&lt;br /&gt;2) There is some sort of chemical reaction between the active ingredient in Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and whatever is inside these cleansing pads. I&#x27;ve tried using Head &amp; Shoulders at different times relative to using this face wash, and no matter whether it&#x27;s before or after, it causes my face to BURN. And I mean intense BURN. So I kicked the Head &amp; Shoulders to the curb (don&#x27;t worry, I don&#x27;t have dandruff, I just bought it cuz I liked the scent) and all is well now. I honestly think there should be a warning on the label for this though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so scared they will stop making these. They&#x27;re really like my beauty secret. I rarely wear makeup these days and I feel SO much more confident in my natural appearance. After all these years, I&#x27;m no longer ashamed of the skin on my face. I am amazed by these cleansing pads!!!Shoulders at different times relative to using this face wash, and no matter whether it&#x27;s before or after, it causes my face to BURN.

    <li> I have used this product for many years.  I find it just what my senior, but oily, skin needs.  The rough side of the pads gives gentle exfoliation and the liquid cleanser on the pads does a great job of giving my facial skin a fresh, clean surface.  I bought a six pack and will replace it with another when it gets low.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for when you don&#x27;t feel like doing your full face ritual before you go to bed.  The pads a big and priced reasonably good for what you receive.  I know they work good at getting the makeup off my face because I&#x27;ve used an astringent after using one of these pads, and there is no dirt or makeup coming off on the cotton ball!  Amazing!  So you know these are getting all the traces of makeup off you face.  The only reason why I deducted a star is because it&#x27;s great they are large, but I feel like I&#x27;m throwing away a lot of product because there is still a lot of cleanser left in the pad after use.  Seems like they could possibly make them a little smaller and make double the pads with all the extra cleanser you loose for the same or near the same price?!  But really it&#x27;s not anything bad, it just seems a waste... If I could give them 4 1/2 stars I would, but it&#x27;s not an option here.  You will love them!  Stock up with this 3 pack deal!</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel like baby skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash and make-up remover for years, so there&#x27;s nothing new I can say about it.  It&#x27;s convenient, inexpensive, and does wonderful things for your skin.  I will continue to use it on a daily basis.....in the shower.  It&#x27;s so convenient that way.</li>
    <li> Love them and can tell if I just skip a day without using them. Now I won&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time and am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for probably six months now and purchase it through the Subscribe and Save option.  I feel it&#x27;s a great value for the money and is an amazing make-up remover.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and dry as some others have.  I&#x27;ve used some high-end cleansers and also some drug-store brands and I am so glad to have found this one that is so good for my skin, while still being very cost effective!</li>
    <li> (29 yrs old) I&#x27;ve only been using this for four days and I cannot believe the improvement of my skin.  I use it twice a day. It is hot here and I&#x27;m always working outside. Dirt... Sweat... And blackheads all over. I have a lot of scarring, too.  The first time I used it my blackheads vanished. I was shocked. I have never had that happen with any other product Ive tried. My complexion has evened out a LOT. I went from bumps everywhere to my face being so smooth it looks like glass. It leaves a nice, firm feeling, which gives me the reminder I need to keep my hands off of my face.  Any other product I&#x27;ve tried has also made me break out.... This has done nothing less than work a miracle.  I can&#x27;t WAIT to see what my face looks like when I am done with all three containers.</li>
    <li> Love it! wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is a much appreciated addition to inventory of things that make my life as easy as one would like to have it. As a person who depends a lot on external sources for my professional fulfillment, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Best face wash pads out there. Highly recommended! Won&#x27;t dry out your skin. I&#x27;ve used after a sunburn and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. Leaves an amazing clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Smell is overpowering, foams too much and requires several rinses to remove, skin is too dry after using.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> cleans without overly drying my skin and got it at a good price&lt;br /&gt;will definitely order it again</li>
    <li> I use the entire Aveeno postively radiant line, as I have very sensitive skin.  These cleansing pads are wonderful and very convenient to have on hand while you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
    <li> Shipment came early, which was a plus. Will order more again next year.</li>
    <li> I love these pads!!! Smells great too i started seeing and feeling a difference in only a few day :))</li>
    <li> I use many different types of face washes from high end to drug store but I always come back to this one. This large round tub has 28 thick (and really big) pads in a solution so you don&#x27;t need any extra face wash. The pads are so large that I cut them in half and and half totally cleanses my face and neck even when I have makeup on. The pads are soft on one side and a bit scrubby on the other to gently exfoliate. The lather is plentiful and the scent is subtle and very pleasant. My face feels and looks great after and doesn&#x27;t feel dry like it does with so many face washes I have used. I have dry aging skin so not zapping the moisture from my face while washing it is a priority for me. My face glows after I use these pads and my serums and creams apply better. I usually try to buy higher end products for my face as I age but Aveeno really got it right with this face wash and I buy it all the time. Trust me, a half of a pad is plenty or use a whole pad and and cleanse your hands for gentle exfoliation. Love it!</li>
    <li> Makes my face &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; and soft.</li>
    <li> These pads work without damaging your skin no matter how much pressure you apply. Lives up to every word of advertising.</li>
    <li> The best fast cleaning pads we have found.  I wish they made refills of just the liquid cleanser inside or sold it seperately.  It is great for our skin.</li>
    <li> I have the most sensitive acne prone skin. This is a miracle! Within a week, everyone could see a difference. Thank you, AVEENO!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Always have.  It makes washing off make-up at day&#x27;s end a breeze.  Great smelling, good for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love it. It works really good for me. I got a very sensitive skin and this product works really good for me!!</li>
    <li> Great product and hard to find in stores lately. I certainly hope Aveeno hasn&#x27;t discontinued these. They are so convenient to use. These will  exfoliate skin, but are very gentle. If I run out and don&#x27;t use them for a few days, I notice my skin starting to look dull and kind of rough.</li>
    <li> My favorite face scrub</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. Very sensitive. I have tried many brands over the years and every one have me troubles. Even coffee grounds! Too much or too little scrubbing makes me break out. I can use these every day and it doesn&#x27;t burn, but cleans well. I have used these for about 7 years while trying others from time to time..I adore these!</li>
    <li> These are the best non prescribed facial cleaning pads you can buy. I have been using them for 2 years. I inadvertently ordered the same pad but the one that&#x27;s anti acne. Well, it was a bit too much for my skin. The anti acne one dried my skin out too much. If you&#x27;ve never used the pads, just make sure you get the correct one for your skin type. My skin looks perfectly polished and glows. These pads are great for makeup removal. Use the Auto Ship and save money and rest well knowing your facial cleansing pads will arrive when you need them.</li>
    <li> This was a great value. I don&#x27;t like using just anything to clean my face. These aver no wipes are great for exfoliating and cleaning my face. You can see the dead skin right on the pad. It&#x27;s not harsh on your face at all.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have purchased these cleansing pads and I love them! I used to use the Nutragena ones but they were making me break out and caused burning and redness to my face. These ones smell great and have a cleansing side and a softer side/ I use them to take off my make up and wash at the same time and they work really great! They leave my skin feeling soft and clean!</li>
    <li> Been using these for a few years...love them.  I also cut them in half when I get them to make them last longer.  I tend not to use the whole pad.</li>
    <li> Love perfect for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Been using these for 2yrs now. LOVE them!! My face always feels clean &amp; clear. I have little to no breakouts &amp; don&#x27;t have to use extra moisturizers. Perfect balance. One side of the pad is rough for exfoliant.</li>
