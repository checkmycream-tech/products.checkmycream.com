      <li>I love this powder...</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t order any more.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this.</li>
      <li>This powder is OK, but it still couldn&#x27;t keep my face from getting oily -</li>
      <li>the compact is cute and easy to carry around</li>
      <li>good thing it is not a common practice for people to come up to your face and sniff it.</li>
      <li>It also settles into my fine lines.</li>
      <li>The color is very light, however if you use a bronzer over top of it it does not even show through and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>Look for the original (not sally hansen).  </li>
      <li>I bought this one and an original Cornsilk powder.  </li>
      <li>This powder is Almost  like the original.</li>
      <li>This is not the original cornsilk \\&quot;recipe\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>The natural matte is VERY light.  </li>
      <li>It produces a fresh uncluttered matte finish whether you wear foundation make-up or not.  </li>
      <li>Worth the buy.</li>
      <li>and it stays for a long time, making your skin super matt and nice.</li>
      <li>i had forgotten just how much i liked this powder, and the fragrance took me back to my high school days!</li>
      <li>It smells like old lady perfume and the scent is so strong, I could smell it all day.</li>
      <li>Luckily I was able to get a quantity from Amazon to last me a few more years.</li>
      <li>The original is far superior, but they are hard to find.  </li>
      <li>I have oily skin, and I&#x27;ve used it since my high school days, but wasn&#x27;t able to find it in stores for several years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still the same pure, simple and effective way to get rid of a shiny nose.</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t put too much on or else i turn into a geisha.</li>
      <li>so I really like that I can order it online</li>
      <li>Okay, but definitely not the old style of Corn Silk...</li>
      <li>It gives me a nice matte finish and covers up the uneven skin tone that my foundation doesn&#x27;t cover...</li>
      <li>So sad this is no longer made, but happy</li>
      <li>However, this powder is more pale in color  than translucent.</li>
      <li>(I always say different places to drive them crazy :P ).</li>
      <li>I can go over it with my bare minerals to further blur imperfections.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Cornsilk in the past, and forgot which color was right for me.  </li>

    <li> I was so happy to find a source for Cornsilk. I have oily skin, and I&#x27;ve used it since my high school days, but wasn&#x27;t able to find it in stores for several years. It&#x27;s still the same pure, simple and effective way to get rid of a shiny nose.</li>
    <li> This stuff is basically a white powder. i can&#x27;t put too much on or else i turn into a geisha. but you only need a little bit to get rid of shine. the compact is cute and easy to carry around so i bring it with me all the time to de-shine my face mid day. the only bad thing is that it smells like a grandma. good thing it is not a common practice for people to come up to your face and sniff it. that would be kinda of weird.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen Cornsilk face powder is a discontinued item in the retail market.  I for one am very sorry to see it go.   It produces a fresh uncluttered matte finish whether you wear foundation make-up or not.  It was replaced by mineral cosmetics of various sorts. I think there is room and need for both products.</li>
    <li> So i love this powder, is the best one ever. my skin never was so perfect, it controls my very oily skin. My coworkers ask what i&#x27;m using, and i answer proudly CORNSILK, those #!@ get mad trying to find where to buy it (I always say different places to drive them crazy :P ). I bought one for my sister and she loves it too. I just made the third purchase this year, i can&#x27;t stop, just figure out if i can&#x27;t find it anymore, i&#x27;d die!   Don&#x27;t waste your time and money in expensive powders, prove CORNSILK benefits and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> So sad this is no longer made, but happy I can find it online.  At least for now.  Nothing sets my liquid foundation and concealer like this.  I can go over it with my bare minerals to further blur imperfections.  Ill be so sad when it&#x27;s really all gone!</li>
    <li> Love this powder! wish it was still around! if you have oily skin, this works!</li>
    <li> Great service! received in just a few days.  Excellent product and service!</li>
    <li> I have always used cornsilk but it has gotten very hard to get anymore so I really like that I can order it online</li>
    <li> I love this powder...I use it once in the morning over my foundation and underneath my bronzer. It gives me a nice matte finish and covers up the uneven skin tone that my foundation doesn&#x27;t cover...I have oily skin and unless I am outside all day I only need to apply this once in the morning. The color is very light, however if you use a bronzer over top of it it does not even show through and looks very natural. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this powder and cannot believe it&#x27;s been discontinued. It smells so good and it stays for a long time, making your skin super matt and nice. It covers a lot too, sometimes I just use this without foundation.  Love it!</li>
    <li> i had forgotten just how much i liked this powder, and the fragrance took me back to my high school days!</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with shipping or purchasing. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this. It left my face way too white even with putting in in with my coverup powder. And it say absorbs oil, I guess my face will always be oily no matter what I buy.</li>
    <li> This powder is OK, but it still couldn&#x27;t keep my face from getting oily - I had to use blotting tissues every couple of hours just like when I used other types of powder. It also settles into my fine lines.</li>
    <li> Not quite the color for my complexion.</li>
    <li> The best product out there!  Wish it was discontinued - bring it back!</li>
    <li> I like corn silk very hard to find in the stores. I received my order and it was as expected.</li>
    <li> This is not the original cornsilk \\&quot;recipe\\&quot;.  Look for the original (not sally hansen).  You can only buy them online or in dollar stores or places where discontinued make up lives.  I bought this one and an original Cornsilk powder.  The original is far superior, but they are hard to find.  I will probably just throw this one away.</li>
    <li> It smells like old lady perfume and the scent is so strong, I could smell it all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using Cornsilk for over 50 years.  I was frantic when I learned it had been discontinued.  Luckily I was able to get a quantity from Amazon to last me a few more years.</li>
    <li> This powder is Almost  like the original. However, this powder is more pale in color  than translucent. It will work though.  Good to know where I can purchase more when needed.</li>
    <li> I wish they&#x27;d bring this back.</li>
    <li> Okay, but definitely not the old style of Corn Silk...won&#x27;t order any more.</li>
    <li> Just as I remembered.  keeps the shine away!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cornsilk in the past, and forgot which color was right for me.  The natural matte is VERY light.  I have to mix it with a little blush powder to blend with my skin color.</li>
    <li> It was okay,,Thought it would have been a larger compact and powder puff would not be sponge.  It works w.e.ll with my other cosmetic products</li>
    <li> THe product I received was USED.  I noticed it wasn&#x27;t sealed, but when I opened the compact, it was quite obvious that someone had used it.</li>
