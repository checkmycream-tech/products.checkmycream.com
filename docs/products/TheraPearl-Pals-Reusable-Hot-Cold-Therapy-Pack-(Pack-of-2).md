### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for scrapes, burns, bee stings, swelling, and bruises&lt;br</li>
      <li>TheraPearl Pals are an excellent and non-messy alternative.  </li>
      <li>These packs are awesome.</li>
      <li>Best boo boo soother out there.</li>
      <li>I LOVED this product!</li>
      <li>You know it&#x27;s a great product when your child gets hurt and</li>
      <li>The pearls are nice because if you&#x27;re icing an ankle or using them as hand warmers, they&#x27;re perfect size and mold well to the location.</li>
      <li>(It worked great, and my son loved it, but he eventually chewed through it</li>
      <li>My kids really liked these heat/ice packs!</li>
      <li>They were fairly well</li>
      <li>She loved squishing the pearls inside.</li>
      <li>All of the times I used the pal it worked great, plus my kids couldn&#x27;t get over how cute the frog was.</li>
      <li>Nothing like a cute smiling frog to get your child&#x27;s mind off the pain!</li>
      <li>These are cute and practical!</li>
      <li>Seems like a nice product but</li>
      <li>As much as my daughter loved the TheraPearl Sports Pack, she loved the Children&#x27;s Pal even better!</li>
      <li>Most of the packs that I have don&#x27;t keep their temperature as they should.</li>
      <li>This is a cute idea for a kids heat/cold pack</li>
      <li>and it is cute.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happier to have a TheraPearls in our home.</li>
      <li>I really love these Thera°</li>
      <li>I took them out of the freezer and they were room temperature within 10 minutes, shorter than I thought, so I&#x27;m glad they came in packages of two.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to say that these Pals, are too cute.</li>
      <li>how many “pearls” they hold.  </li>
      <li>Cute design</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already used it myself on my back and it worked great!</li>
      <li>Has way more air than beads.</li>
      <li>The boo-boo buddies are much better.  </li>
      <li>My kids have gotten bee stings, scrapes, bruises, and of course more.</li>
      <li>They are cute and I will still use them once in a while, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.</li>
      <li>&quot; inside are very cool.</li>
      <li>It also warmed up very quickly.</li>
      <li>The TheraPearl eyemask I got was fantastic and very full of beads, this has probably 30-40 pearls in it.</li>
      <li>This is very quick and easy and very much useful!</li>
      <li>Two things though, make sure to lightly squeeze the pearls around after using for heat because the heat doesn&#x27;t evenly distribute and can be too hot to give to a child if you don&#x27;t do this.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfect for small locations.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise these are pretty cute and useful.</li>
      <li>This &#x27;thaws&#x27; really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
      <li>They are colorful, fun, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I would have been happy with 1, but when I saw 2, I thought keep one in freezer while other is in use</li>
      <li>I suggest contacting the company from other reviews it sounds as I they have great customer service.</li>
      <li>I am impressed enough with the product, and the company, that I am compelled to update my amazon review with my recent experience.</li>
      <li>Once they start to warm up, they will cool off fairly quickly when put back into the freezer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A First Aid must for children!  </li>
      <li>The soft vinyl filled with squishy pearls feels comfortable against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall nice product idea.</li>
      <li>super cute and kids love....used very lightly for a few months and started to leak.</li>
      <li>The fun characters drew her attention, hopefully they would distract her if she wasn&#x27;t feeling good and help calm her down.</li>
      <li>The directions are right on the Thera°</li>
      <li>The directions are right on the Thera°</li>
      <li>tall, just the right size to soothe bumps, scratches, cuts, and stings.  </li>
      <li>The colorful animal characters are absolutely adorable, so they not only provide cooling relief, but also provide needed</li>
      <li>The soft material and the size make them easy for the baby&#x27;s hands to grab.</li>
      <li>It was easy for her to hold the pal on her face by herself so that was nice as it left Mommy with an extra set of hands.</li>
      <li>When I first got the Pal Frog out of the package, I couldn&#x27;t help but roll the pearls around in my hands, they are somewhat soothing and relaxing.</li>
      <li>had stopped by a store last night and found a boo boo buddy that will work better than this.  </li>
      <li>Plus, they maintain their heat/cold for at least 20 minutes which is great.</li>
      <li>the first thing thy say is &amp;#34;I need a Thera</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s also so darn cute that it seems to just cheer you up, especially the kids, when they are hurt.</li>
      <li>Pearl Pal in the microwave, go slowly at first and add a bit of time.  </li>
      <li>This looked identical, so I ordered a &amp;#34;three-pack&amp;#34; (at a correspondingly higher price than than the single-pack item).  </li>
      <li>It has so much air in the frog that I don&#x27;t see how it can be useful</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s all ready to go!</li>
      <li>thought they were very cute and just the right size for little boo-boos, and then put them in the freezer.</li>
      <li>The hot/cold pack came filled with beads barely 25% of the way up.</li>
      <li>TherePearl offers a huge variety of products that offers relief in cold or hot packs that are safe and last for the perfect amount of time recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One of the best things is when you need a cold or hot pack placed on a certain area like the neck or a finger, it really contours to the area.</li>
      <li>these little Thera°Pearl Pals are perfect for little ones.  </li>
      <li>They are really flexible as well and conform well to the area you are trying to cover.</li>
      <li>Some children are very squeamish about having ice applied to their skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I could really squish the pearls against my shins to get them cooled.</li>
      <li>Does not have nearly as much beads in it as it shows in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While the picture makes the product appear that it is actually full of the pearls, the pearls barely fill the feet of the frog.</li>
      <li>For example, my microwave is older and when I put one in for ten seconds it wasn’t warm enough.  </li>
      <li>Pearl packs give off a slow, steady bit of heat that feels quite good when I hold the pack in my hands or against a part of my body that’s achy.  </li>
      <li>The one I received was full of air and not enough pearls.</li>
      <li>Mostly I like them because they offer up that little bit of heat</li>
      <li>The frog design is adorable and the green</li>
      <li>doubt I do love these packs and will keep them on hand for those little emergencies that seem to frequently show up in this house.  </li>
      <li>Nice for kids as it is very small.</li>
      <li>This cute little guy is BOTH!</li>
      <li>I love the little pearls and my son thinks they are neat!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not overly huge but also not to little.</li>
      <li>TheraPearl Pals can also be used before removing adhesive bandages from sensitive skin to reduce the \\&quot;ouch\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, there are no leaks and they are very flexible since the pearls don&#x27;t freeze solid.</li>
      <li>Ice is also cheap and easy to make and I usually have enough on hand for emergencies, large or small.  </li>
      <li>The are only filled about halfway with the small green beads, so it is mostly air.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be willing to give it a try, but not at three times the cost for a single item.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have much faith that it will hold up very long.  </li>
      <li>Now we he really has a bump, I can actually get him to put this ice pack on it for a short period.</li>
      <li>They are really super cute, but the pearls inside don&#x27;t get as cold as I expected and there was too much excess air inside that</li>
      <li>$10 for one tiny half-filled pack is a complete ripoff.</li>
      <li>I had the exact same problem as the other reviewers.</li>
      <li>I thought there would be more pearls and less air in each frog, that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are cute and practical! A First Aid must for children!  Nothing like a cute smiling frog to get your child&#x27;s mind off the pain!</li>
    <li> I had the exact same problem as the other reviewers. I only received one item, not a pack of 2. The one I received was full of air and not enough pearls. $10 for one tiny half-filled pack is a complete ripoff.</li>
    <li> When you have kids it seems like something is always happening to where you need either a cold or hot pack. My kids have gotten bee stings, scrapes, bruises, and of course more. Kids to me are little walking accident prone little people. Of course, they must get it from me, since I have gotten older I still have accidents to where I need a cold or hot pack myself. Most of the packs that I have don&#x27;t keep their temperature as they should. They also don&#x27;t contour to the body shape we need them too. TherePearl offers a huge variety of products that offers relief in cold or hot packs that are safe and last for the perfect amount of time recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not overly huge but also not to little. I have to say that these Pals, are too cute. When I first got the Pal Frog out of the package, I couldn&#x27;t help but roll the pearls around in my hands, they are somewhat soothing and relaxing. The pals are very versatile, which allows them to be used either hot or cold. It didn&#x27;t take long after receiving the pal, that one of my kids were in need for the use of the Pal Frog for a boo boo. I have had this for a few weeks now and have used it several different times. All of the times I used the pal it worked great, plus my kids couldn&#x27;t get over how cute the frog was. One of the best things is when you need a cold or hot pack placed on a certain area like the neck or a finger, it really contours to the area. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier to have a TheraPearls in our home.</li>
    <li> As much as my daughter loved the TheraPearl Sports Pack, she loved the Children&#x27;s Pal even better! The fun characters drew her attention, hopefully they would distract her if she wasn&#x27;t feeling good and help calm her down. It was easy for her to hold the pal on her face by herself so that was nice as it left Mommy with an extra set of hands. She loved squishing the pearls inside. Hopefully we don&#x27;t use these often, but when we do, they&#x27;ll get the job done.</li>
    <li> While the picture makes the product appear that it is actually full of the pearls, the pearls barely fill the feet of the frog. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re definitely small and don&#x27;t stay cold/warm for long periods of time, but for cold/warm therapy (20 minutes on) it&#x27;s perfect for small locations.  The pearls are nice because if you&#x27;re icing an ankle or using them as hand warmers, they&#x27;re perfect size and mold well to the location.</li>
    <li> My kids really liked these heat/ice packs! They are colorful, fun, and easy to use. I love that when used as ice packs they do not get hard or stiff. Plus, they maintain their heat/cold for at least 20 minutes which is great.</li>
    <li> Some children are very squeamish about having ice applied to their skin. TheraPearl Pals are an excellent and non-messy alternative.  The colorful animal characters are absolutely adorable, so they not only provide cooling relief, but also provide needed distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packs are about 4 1/2 in. tall, just the right size to soothe bumps, scratches, cuts, and stings.  The soft vinyl filled with squishy pearls feels comfortable against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easiest to simply store them in the freezer.  Once they start to warm up, they will cool off fairly quickly when put back into the freezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TheraPearl Pals can also be used before removing adhesive bandages from sensitive skin to reduce the \\&quot;ouch\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I bought this strictly for icing my shins after running. They are really super cute, but the pearls inside don&#x27;t get as cold as I expected and there was too much excess air inside that I don&#x27;t feel like I could really squish the pearls against my shins to get them cooled. However, there are no leaks and they are very flexible since the pearls don&#x27;t freeze solid. I was hoping for it to be icy cold, but these don&#x27;t stay cold for too long. They are cute and I will still use them once in a while, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> These packs are awesome. My toddler loves the design and when he gets a little booboo he always ask for his frog.  Now we he really has a bump, I can actually get him to put this ice pack on it for a short period. They are really flexible as well and conform well to the area you are trying to cover.</li>
    <li> I really love these Thera°Pearl packs for a couple of reasons and these little Thera°Pearl Pals are perfect for little ones.  Mostly I like them because they offer up that little bit of heat I sometimes need for pain or discomfort.  Ice packs are plentiful and varied and I do have plenty of them.  Ice is also cheap and easy to make and I usually have enough on hand for emergencies, large or small.  I was primarily interested in these small Thera°Pearl packs for their ability to provide a bit of heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put your Thera°Pearl Pal in the microwave, go slowly at first and add a bit of time.  For example, my microwave is older and when I put one in for ten seconds it wasn’t warm enough.  I ended up putting them in for the max of 14 seconds to get what I wanted.  The amount of heat isn’t scaling, but just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat garnered from these small packs isn’t excessive nor do I feel it was intended to be.  The Thera°Pearl packs give off a slow, steady bit of heat that feels quite good when I hold the pack in my hands or against a part of my body that’s achy.  I have the regular Thera°Pearl packs and would swap them off every ten minutes or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Perfect for scrapes, burns, bee stings, swelling, and bruises&lt;br /&gt;►  Freeze and Microwave&lt;br /&gt;►  Reusable and Non-toxic&lt;br /&gt;►  Latex, Lead, and BPA-free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to try out the Thera°Pearl packs, don’t delude yourself thinking a few seconds in the microwave or twenty minutes in the freezer will give you hours of relief because they won’t.  The “Ribbie” Thera°Pal is approximately 4-1/2” longs and 3-1/2” wide so that will give you an idea as to how many “pearls” they hold.  Using these was a little like a tag team match because I was swapping them out for another frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No doubt I do love these packs and will keep them on hand for those little emergencies that seem to frequently show up in this house.  They don’t get steaming hot or blindingly cold, but rather are just right.  If you have heavier needs in either the hot or cold department, simply take a pass.  The directions are right on the Thera°Peal packs so you won’t be misplacing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.use.

    <li> Tiny! Has way more air than beads. Don&#x27;t have much faith that it will hold up very long.  Definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t going to sooth anything.  The boo-boo buddies are much better.  This &#x27;thaws&#x27; really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product! We are a family of 5, almost 6 and there always seems to be some type of injury in our household. We usually spring for the cold packs or just plain old ice in a wash cloth or a warm compress if needed. This cute little guy is BOTH! you can use it for both cold and heat therapy! He&#x27;s also so darn cute that it seems to just cheer you up, especially the kids, when they are hurt. For cold therapy, you just pop this cute little buddy in the freezer and get it all cold and for heat, you pop him in the microwave for just a few short seconds and it&#x27;s all ready to go! This is very quick and easy and very much useful! I&#x27;ve already used it myself on my back and it worked great!</li>
    <li> Cute design but doesn&#x27;t get cold enough and not as moldable as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> My son had something similar to this that he received as a party favor, and I was looking to replace it.  (It worked great, and my son loved it, but he eventually chewed through it and I had to throw it out.)  This looked identical, so I ordered a &amp;#34;three-pack&amp;#34; (at a correspondingly higher price than than the single-pack item).  Unfortunately, I only received one, NOT three.  In addition, as another reviewer mentioned, it has a LOT of excess air inside (and very few &amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34;), so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work.  I&#x27;d be willing to give it a try, but not at three times the cost for a single item.  It looks like I&#x27;ll have to send this one back and keep looking...  My son is going to be so disappointed, as he was looking forward to getting his &amp;#34;froggy&amp;#34; to use on his boo-boos.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just got a dud but I can literally count the number of beads in this frog. Not enough filling to make any boo boo go away. The TheraPearl eyemask I got was fantastic and very full of beads, this has probably 30-40 pearls in it.</li>
    <li> I got the frog  and it is cute. Nice for kids as it is very small. Also got only one and paid for three. Doesn&#x27;t stay cold very long</li>
    <li> This is a cute idea for a kids heat/cold pack but they are too small. I love the little pearls and my son thinks they are neat! They were fairly well priced- I bought 2 packs for $11. Two things though, make sure to lightly squeeze the pearls around after using for heat because the heat doesn&#x27;t evenly distribute and can be too hot to give to a child if you don&#x27;t do this. (I only put mine in for 12-15 seconds wrapped in a lightly wet paper towel to heat  Also, they are pretty small, wish they were twice the size that they are but I guess they are for little kids. My son likes to use them at night on colder nights to \\&quot;snuggle\\&quot; with so that is why I wish they were a bit bigger.  Overall nice product idea.</li>
    <li> it isnt a pack or two and the one that i did get seemed like it barly had any thermal beads at all</li>
    <li> What wrong with it&lt;br /&gt;1) It says (PACK 2) and there was only one. Looks like his has been an issue for a while and they either a) do not feel like correcting the Amazon page b) someone keeps sending the wrong package.  I would have been happy with 1, but when I saw 2, I thought keep one in freezer while other is in use so we always have one available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It has so much air in the frog that I don&#x27;t see how it can be useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Does not have nearly as much beads in it as it shows in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had stopped by a store last night and found a boo boo buddy that will work better than this.  I should have read the reviews before I purchased, if I had I may not have ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post pictures on here so others can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neat concept, poor quality control in manufacturing.</li>
    <li> When these arrived I opened them, thought they were very cute and just the right size for little boo-boos, and then put them in the freezer. Unfortunately, when I actually had an occasion to use them, I found out that cute doesn&#x27;t cut it. The are only filled about halfway with the small green beads, so it is mostly air. This makes it difficult to get the cold part on the area where it is needed. It also warmed up very quickly. My three-year-old asked for another ice pack because \\&quot;this one isn&#x27;t working.\\&quot; I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best boo boo soother out there. The frog is my one child&#x27;s fav and the pig is the other.  You know it&#x27;s a great product when your child gets hurt and the first thing thy say is &amp;#34;I need a Thera pal!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We keep a supply in the freezer and have used over twenty times and there is not any sign of wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone not satisfied I suggest contacting the company from other reviews it sounds as I they have great customer service.</li>
    <li> Image is deceiving. The hot/cold pack came filled with beads barely 25% of the way up. It&#x27;s basically a bag of air.</li>
    <li> I have the frog and the pig...super cute and kids love....used very lightly for a few months and started to leak.</li>
    <li> The description said &amp;#34;3-pack&amp;#34; but there is only one little froggie ice pack in there.  Seems like a nice product but sadly 2/3 of what I was expecting is missing.</li>
    <li> Used these for a fever on the forehead. The fact that these are pearls and not a gel I think make it make them a little bit less cold, which means we didn&#x27;t have to use a hanky between the cold pack and the baby&#x27;s skin. The soft material and the size make them easy for the baby&#x27;s hands to grab. The frog design is adorable and the green \\&quot;pearls\\&quot; inside are very cool. I took them out of the freezer and they were room temperature within 10 minutes, shorter than I thought, so I&#x27;m glad they came in packages of two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because there&#x27;s a lot of air in the frog pack, making it difficult to lay flat and stay on the baby&#x27;s forehead, leg or arm. I thought there would be more pearls and less air in each frog, that&#x27;s my only complaint. Otherwise these are pretty cute and useful.</li>
    <li> These packs never completely freeze, so loses they lose their effect almost immediately.  Waste of your money!  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really a pack of 2.  But the one we received the kids like.  We haven&#x27;t broken it yet, but doesn&#x27;t feel like a solid product.  It says it&#x27;s for heat, but I feel like the plastic holding all the gel balls in would melt.  Perhaps not, but it&#x27;s just not something I think I should put in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  TheraPearl saw my review and responded that my shipment had been incorrect, that the second cold pack had been omitted, and were kind enough to send along another.  They sent along a few others which I have shared with friends.  I have also tried the packs in the microwave for heat and they work as well as they do used cold.  I am impressed enough with the product, and the company, that I am compelled to update my amazon review with my recent experience.</li>
