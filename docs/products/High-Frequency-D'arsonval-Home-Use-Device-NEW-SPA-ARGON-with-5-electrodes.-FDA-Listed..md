      <li>It really works!!</li>
      <li>I have to say after reading all the positive reviews, I was really excited to get this.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product has helped remove some fine lines, I do wish they would have given a dvd with it.  I will continue to use it and purchase more of the glass argon accessaries</li>
    <li> work very good. Strong. I&#x27;m use  2-3 times per week.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It came wonderfully packaged with very easy care instructions.  I&#x27;ve been getting high frequency treatments from my esthetician for years now and this looks, feels and smells exactly the same. The first time you use it you may be gun shy...zapping yourself \\&quot;jolted\\&quot; me a bit but after experimenting with the level of intensity I could take, it was easy.  Set up is a breeze and you need to be delicate with the probes.  I&#x27;ve used it twice since getting it a few days ago.  Well worth the investment so far.  More results to follow.</li>
    <li> It feels like it is working. It is painless and easy to use. I use mine for cosmetic reasons but it has proved useful as a tool for a damaged lymph gland.</li>
    <li> I think it works. Came quick. Discription was good. But I don&#x27;t use it at much as its recommended to show results. It&#x27;s for daily use.</li>
    <li> I love this item and I have had it for over a year. New Spa is great to work with,the order arrived on time and the instructions were with it. The boxe that it arrived in was wonderful and I can tell the difference of my skin.  I would definitely order more products from New Spa.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! The idea is a little frightening at first, but, the process is pain free and comfortable. Very happy with the results after only several usages.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and went through having the little shocks on my face. I took before and after closeup pictures of my face and I did not notice any difference.</li>
    <li> like using this helps with skin integrity</li>
    <li> Hi.I have only used this product for five days,but so far so good.I am not able to say anything negative.I do like that my brown skin tone is more clear and my super large pores have definitely changed for the better. I noticed a slight break-out.It would not be something anyone else would notice but I know my skin.I believe this to be a purging affect of the built up toxins in my skin.At this time I make sure I use this at least once a day and twice on nights off.I find this product very easy to use regardless of the horrible user manual.It seems to be written in broken English. So thus far I have a healthy glow,smaller pores and a reduction in my forehead eleven lines,and a reduction in the vertical lines extending across my forehead. I will update weekly because I am hoping I can continue to rate this with five stars.So far I am very pleased.It only cost...under forty.I would never have purchased if not for the promising reviews. In the battle of aging this is my new weapon.It looks like a much more expensive product then you would expect to pay under forty dollars for.It was packaged professionally too.My only concern is if will affect my blood pressure so now I keep it on the low setting and I check my pressure.Bye for now.</li>
    <li> Just received it today. Tried it and love it. Feel refreshed after doing it for the first time. I will come back and edit this review 2 weeks from now to let you guys know the changes    UPDATED SEP 25    After months of using it, acne does not improve. Breakouts still occur. HOWEVER, if I do it 3 times a week, I can see my skin condition improve.    NOT RECOMMENDED for treating acne</li>
    <li> Best product for an acne prone complexion! I use it on inflamed pimples for at least 5 minutes and it noticeably dries up over night! This is the most effective treatment I&#x27;ve found for the painful and inflamed pimples I tend to get! It also helps kill dermatitis!</li>
    <li> Gave me serious headaches</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this as I have adult acne and am fighting the timeless take over of age.  Works as it says it will.  Best to watch videos on utube first.  I find it hard to locate the oils needed and no advise on which ones to use were in the instructions.</li>
    <li> I am a huge believe of high frequency devices. My skin does tend to break out every so often so acne is my primary concern. Every time i get a facial and the esthetician uses this device, my skin is decongested, glowing and plumper for weeks. Hence i decided to invest in one of these machine to keep my skin clear of the small bumps that may come up and to keep my skin glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i am sad to say this device has not worked for me at all. I got it in mid Feb 2014 and used it appropriately following the instructions. I also would like to mention the device i received had a few small scuff marks which i only noticed a month in and then i started paying closer attention to the device and it has sign of use. the electrodes had a few tiny scratches which are not too easy to spot with naked eye. I tried calling the seller via their number listed on the website and got nowhere. Money down the drain for me with this one. And i most certainly will not be buying any more products from NEW SPA anymore.</li>
    <li> I started using and first week I saw changes - my face got smoother skin more radiant and I am not big fan of active skincare - I use creams or serums but never seen great results so I dont believe in them much . So everybody know after 40 skin wrinkles on your chest after you woke up- I got them too recently  and after 5 days of using this device they were gone - that was so encouraging  s- I use every day 5 min AM and 5 min before I got to bed  and in the morning my face looks always better then the night I forgot to use it - its works -but need to follow regimen - when I stopped for a week-  all wrinkles returned .  Area around eyes responding very well too- I think I will skip my botox this quarter , just make sure apply rich cream before you use  this device it allows a smooth glide -</li>
    <li> Good by deep painful cystic acne before important events!!!!! MUWHAHA!!! I feel like I can take over the world now!</li>
    <li> I was so excited about ordering this device--I have thinning hair and I was looking forward to treating it with something that wasn&#x27;t a chemical that would leave my hair feeling all coated and slimy. Great price, good reviews, sounded perfect. I saw the health warnings and checked with my doctor. While I have high blood pressure and take medication for it, my doctor and I were pretty sure this would be fine for my use because it is well controlled. Unfortunately, even 10 minutes of a treatment has made my blood pressure go up a good 20-30 points which means it is NOT safe for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think it is an amazing product, and I love the feeling of &amp;#34;aliveness&amp;#34; it gave to my head. Please be careful and check the health warnings with your doctor if any of them apply to you.</li>
    <li> I received it very quickly and all the wands were undamaged.  I&#x27;ve just had this for little more than a month.  After the first use, my skin felt softer and started to glow.  As I have continued to use, I have seen my skin tone even out, and the hyperpigmentation caused by too much sun in my teens is continuing to diminish.  I have started to see the finer lines diminish as I continue to use it.  I use it almost everyday with a 1 week break every two weeks, at the highest setting.  At worst, I have some reddening that dissipates after a couple of hours and is easily covered with foundation. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother in law.  She claims it helps her with her headache and tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, the thing broke in roughly one month. We are ordering a replacement but will see how long that lasts.</li>
    <li> I received a product a month ago. It is excellent. Two of my friends ordered it after my demo. I read many articles about violet ray technology. Was theoretically prepared to use it for the family members. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have acne-prone skin and my hormonal acne strikes again! I have only used this device three times and I must say that it really shrinks my inflamed pimples. I do not plan on using this device for everyday, probably as necessary for my inflamed pimples and weekly to help regulate my sebum production. I must say, so far, so good for this product! Argon gas is for antibacterial effect and I honestly think it helps heal my pimples faster than benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/28/2014: I have been using this product almost everyday for spot treatment and every 2-3 days for sebum control. I think that it helps heal my pimples faster than benzoyl or salicylic acid. So worth it!</li>
    <li> Item arrived undamaged yet it does not work at all, no juice, not even a little.  I was looking for a replacement to the original &amp;#34;Violet Ray Machine&amp;#34; manufactured by &amp;#34;Baar Products.&amp;#34;  I bought one back in 98 for $170 and they are now $400.  If this device would only work I bet it would be just as good but mine did not work even for a second.  Sorry for the bad review but every item should be tested before it is sent to a customer.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars because I like the packaging and quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;And minus 1 star because I already have a hand-held HF devices (much cheaper) and I think it does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I only bought this item because it has few other optional use.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for two weeks and now I am on a recommended break time.&lt;br /&gt;My hair grew faster ( I dyed my hair so it is easy to see how fast and how much it grew) and my hair feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;I have large pores on my face and this is the main reason I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I know minimizing the pore size is not an easy task so I&#x27;m trying to give it at least a year to see the big difference this time.&lt;br /&gt;So far I see firmness on my cheek area.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I waited so long to have my own high frequency device at home.  I have had acne all my life and struggled with cysts, white heads, pustules, etc.  And although I am in my forty&#x27;s now and do not breakout as often, my skin still sensitive to bacteria, stress, and hormonal imbalances.  This device reduces the inflammation and the  PAIN of the blemishes in just a couple of days compared to a couple of weeks.  In addition to that, it gives my skin a smooth radiant glow.  I am so happy with this device.  The price is reasonable too.</li>
    <li> like it. all family use High Frequency D&#x27;arsonval device for a year, it works!</li>
    <li> I love it! I use it in all my facials!</li>
    <li> This device worked once. The second time I plugged it in and turned it on at the lowest setting, it blew a fuse. I reset the fuse and tried it in another room and it blew another fuse. Not sure what went wrong with the unit. My house was built in the past 20 years, no electrical load concerns. Never got any feedback, however Amazon couldn&#x27;t have made it easier to return.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have good direction, wasn&#x27;t as effective as previoussly stated by others</li>
    <li> this unit is not listed as being professional grade.  the \\&quot;pro\\&quot; high frequency units are well over $100, some nearing 200.  as a skin care technician, i can tell you this works great.  even the lowest setting is substantial for an effective treatment.  i can&#x27;t imagine what this baby can do fully cranked!  super super fast shipping, beautiful sturdy packaging.  this device will last a long time, and i&#x27;m glad i took a chance on a less expensive, not-reviewed product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when i ordered it, but this thing works really well. I use it for my daughters acne, and i use it on my face for small lines and dark spots. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I used this product everyday for a week and then every other day. I could tell a difference in my skin, I do not have problems with pimples and I got some the first week I used it. I did not stop because I felt it was clearing up things I could not see. I wanted it for skin tightening effect. I had to stop due to illness and I will begin again. As soon as I feel better. I recommend this product. It came with instructions and very good package to store product to keep the glass attachments safe. It is like everything you must be consistent. I hope this helps. It is strong and you can smell the ozone.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> I have to say after reading all the positive reviews, I was really excited to get this.  I began using the rod wand on my acne prone skin on existing blemishes.  I did this religiously each morning and found that it was extremely drying to my face.  It basically dries out the blemish (as would a $22 bottle of EradiKate by Kate Somerville).  I&#x27;m disappointed, all in all with shipping, I just wasted about $95 on this.</li>
    <li> I gave this quite a while before posting my review and it&#x27;s NOT POSITIVE.  There is no indication whatsoever on what this claims to do.  Such a waste of money, waste of time, waste of hopes to find something that really works.&lt;br /&gt;SO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Love love love.&lt;br /&gt;In just 4 short weeks I see a VAST improvement on my skin.  Scars are disappearing, no blemishes are forming, and I am so so happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;A must buy if you have problem skin.</li>
    <li> I love mine and have had it since March 2011.  It works well and I store mine in its case for safe keeping!</li>
    <li> The aesthetician used one on me and i am saving everytime i don&#x27;t have to pay for a facial! Every time a family member gets a blemish we pull out the device and pow, its gone in no time. Also great to make glycolic and lactic  peels work better.</li>
    <li> This works really well.  It&#x27;s easy to use and adjust the setting to what&#x27;s best for you.  The tools are well packed and protected in styrofoam that makes for easy storage within the case.  I don&#x27;t use the mask that&#x27;s recommended, but use hyaluronic acid before and after with no problems.  I&#x27;m so glad I got this for myself as I had used an at home IPL device, which caused depressions to form above my eyebrows and took the fat out of half of my bottom lip, leaving me looking (and feeling) lopsided and strange.  This product has completely restored the area above my eyebrows and refilled nearly all of my lip area to the point where I&#x27;m not in the least self conscious about it anymore.  It&#x27;s not perfect yet, but it&#x27;s getting there.  It also makes my skin look and feel rejuvenated and it&#x27;s visibly smoother and feels much better too.  The results don&#x27;t go away either.  They&#x27;re permanent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, after she saw ad for similar &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; products.&lt;br /&gt;She did not find any noticeable effect after using it for 2 weeks, but feels the applicatio nactually dries up her skin. After resting for 2 weeks she re-applied, but this time suffers minor skin irritation &amp; rash. Perhaps it is not this particular product itself, rather all products of this category have such effect on delicate/sensitive skin ? We just store it to 1 side, &amp; I&#x27;m not sure if hse&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
    <li> I love love this product I use the rake and mushroom wand my hair has grown 2inches since i got it and my face is just glowing the only problem I had was that the rake worked 1 time and I contacted the company and they sent me another one in record time.  I will be buying more products from them.  Excellent product love it</li>
    <li> I use this product after I pluck my eyebrows to help clear up the pores, where I used to have issues with bumps or acne after plucking. It helps skins texture and tone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this device! I tried the derma wand and liked it, this is quite superior, and it even costs less! Amazing value for the money! great presentation, beautifully packaged, plus it arrived fast.</li>
    <li> your own high frequency machine. Salons charge at least 30 dollars a treatment. Do it at home to tighten skin.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well. I just need to use it more.</li>
    <li> It really works!! I love it! Thank you New Spa ;-)</li>
    <li> It was better than I thought. I really liked it.</li>
    <li> This product works just like the same product the professionals use. I now use it instead of going to the spa to waste my money.</li>
    <li> Im really happy with mine! It works perfectly, just like the one in the salon where I work. It came in a pretty box, and has all the pieces that was advertised. Good quality cant go wrong with it!</li>
    <li> Powerful too - thank goodness it has different settings - I&#x27;m still on the lowest one - amazing for acne - the little thin unit zaps them and really well.  My husband has them on his back, and has always swam with his t shirt on - not this year. He&#x27;s really happy about that.  I get them occasionally on my face and this, combined with Paula&#x27;s Choice BHA 2% or the acne treatment, makes those ones under your skin (the painful ones) disappear in 2 days.  Amazing - both combined.</li>
    <li> I learned about this device many years ago in cosmetology school. I have poor circulation and wanted to increase blood flow to my face. After I use this my skin tingles and I have more color in my face.  Just be sure to follow the directions so you don&#x27;t zap yourself. I highly recommend this and it is reasonably priced. I saw the same one in a store for $159.00.</li>
    <li> todo perfecto como lo describian&lt;br /&gt;lo recomiendo.. sigan asi..&lt;br /&gt;todo perfecto como lo describian&lt;br /&gt;lo recomiendo.. sigan asi.. mejor imposible</li>
    <li> I have never been treated with one of these by an esthetician, but I can&#x27;t say I see any difference with this thing other than it seems to turn a spot on my nose into a thin scab.  The directions don&#x27;t exactly make sense as it&#x27;s supposed to stay on your skin while on but you are only supposed to move it in one direction, so I can&#x27;t figure out how to go in only one direction without taking it off. Also, the attachments just spin around so you can&#x27;t really control them.&lt;br /&gt;Seems kind of like a ghostbusters gadget to me.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. It does nothing but sting me when power is on high. Never again will I waste my 85.00 on anything like this</li>
    <li> This is easy to use, and I can see results after 3 weeks. My skin has tightened, brown spots and discoloration are already fading. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> really nice product. makes my face look really fresh and youthful! easy to use and really effective! i highly reccomend this product!</li>
    <li> Loved the results, but it broke a few months later. I purchased a new one and Amazon refunded me for my initial purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this every once in a while and i have to say it helps keep my ace clear of acne and small pimples. Be cautious not to use it at high power can cause static friction (small shock feeling).</li>
    <li> It is really useful to have this at home. Occasional under eye puffiness due to lack of sleep, or blemishes or the red swellings are gone in just 1 or 2 uses. I find it really useful to have it at home. I had lot of cysts on my jawline and my beautician used this machine after cleaning and exfoliating my skin. The skin after this treatment was really clean and smooth and with less breakouts. That is why I bought it for home use so that I can save some money.&lt;br /&gt;I gave only 4 stars to this because of the delicate nature of the tubes which are made up of glass.&lt;br /&gt;I am always worried that it might break while using it, not that it has happened so far.</li>
    <li> I start to use it a year ago, it helped me to get rid of pimples and oily face skin. Even used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s back - helped him very fast. The best thing I ever tried since my pimples appear on my face (I was 18), so it took me 5 years to find a cure...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the ppl who made such thing affordable.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I use it on regular basis.</li>
    <li> It was on time, but I&#x27;m  still getting use to it. I have to use every items in the package, update later.</li>
    <li> I love these machines.  They work wonders.  I ordered one for my scalp as I&#x27;m having skin issues, and I know that this works for that.  Also thickening up my hair would be nice as well.  The only thing is that this is just as the booklet in the box says, &amp;#34;Not for professional use&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a little bit wimpy, but it does seem like it is doing the job somewhat decently.  I would recommend this exact model if you are low on money and need this treatment...but if you can save up to get the $200+ models then do it.</li>
    <li> The mushroom head broken after 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;It seems not helping my grey hair after using it twice everyday for 1 week. But feel like my hair grow more recently.&lt;br /&gt;It does help my pimple infection a little bit, not complely.</li>
    <li> Years ago my hairdresser had one of these and he would periodically give me treatments.  Recently I noticed that my hairline at my temples was breaking off badly and the hair had thinned to almost nothing.  I began using this tool and I also added castor oil to my nightly routine before I went to bed.  In two weeks my edges/hairline was filling in. And now 3 months later it not as full as it was when I was a child but its fuller than its been in years!</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Good quality product.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping. The high frequency is my wife&#x27;s favorite part of getting a salon facial, and now she can do it regularly. Would buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the high hopes of looking younger and tightening my skin alittle. Using this product wasnt hard.&lt;br /&gt;Its very easy to use and there is no burning, no discomfort at all. My peeve began when my skin would break out the day after using as directed. There was an irritation happening so i stopped using it. Maybe it will work for not so sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this high frequency machine. It would help with the inflammation of some of the cystic acne that I have. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t rate if it would work long term for pores or firming skin because it did stop working after 5 months. I&#x27;m disappointed because I really liked it.</li>
    <li> I bought the product to help treat my acne problem.  I am 43 and recently had a break out that won&#x27;t clear up. Tried many product and go an allergic reaction.  This high frequency machine is great.  I don&#x27;t need any serum but the regular product and high frequency treat for 10 min every night.  The acne cleared up and if I use it on a zit that is red and swollen, the next day the swelling will go down.  I will keep using this product</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST thing I ever purchased.  I&#x27;ma a skincare-a-holic, I obsess over the smallest things on my face all day everyday starring and learning my pores, sunspots, breakouts etc.  I&#x27;m 27 and and I&#x27;d break out at least 3X/ month all due to hormonal imbalance or caused by stress related issues not to mention my annoying large pores, all the sun damage my face was really a mess without makeup.  I have been using the device for about 2 months now no joke; it changed my entire complexion, my skin is clear of occasional breakouts, sunspots are fading away, pores significantly tightened, and oh yes no more bumps and blackheads AND the spot treatment specula WILL kill acne within a day; the redness, swelling is gone and that stubborn evil pimple is dried up the next day.  This argon miracle changed my life!!!!  My face is so clear of all the imperfections, well balanced and gloooooowing.  I&#x27;m so grateful to the makers of D&#x27;arsonval thank you for making this device so unbelievably incredible, affordable and easy to use.  This high frequency device is super safe and actually it&#x27;s really good for you (trust. i did an extensive research before purchasing) it comes with 3 additional specula things to help with wrinkles, hair loss, and even celulite.</li>
    <li> I do believe these type of devices work - I&#x27;ve seen results using this one with the firmness and texture of my skin.  However, the directions included with this product are lacking and difficult to understand.  Also, within 5 months it started shorting out and I&#x27;ve had to use electrical tape to play with the cord in order to keep it working.  I&#x27;ll eventually try a different brand.</li>
