      <li>I think the scents are great if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents.</li>

      <li>After using it for a week, my feet were as good as new again!</li>
      <li>Fantastic product-</li>
      <li>or if you just want to touch up before your next one, this has everything it takes to give yourself a great  pedicure, everything except the water and towels, that is.</li>
      <li>The stone didn&#x27;t fit into the handle correctly, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to fall off</li>
      <li>The tea tree oil foot repair balm is worth its weight in gold!  </li>
      <li>The value of this kit is great, considering the lotion in it is worth half this price :).</li>
      <li>my feet have never been so soft and looked amazing.</li>
      <li>The set is nice &amp; used frequently.</li>
      <li>This is a great kit, great price and really works for tired feet</li>
      <li>It has a cool minty smell which i like.</li>
      <li>Cute set, definitely with buy another :)</li>
      <li>Was delivered quickly and well packed.  </li>
      <li>so now he wants a pedicure every 2 weeks !!</li>
      <li>This is a great little kit.</li>
      <li>The scrub and pumice stone don&#x27;t remove all the dead skin and the lotion doesn&#x27;t do a great job either</li>
      <li>I have tried every product or at least most and nothing  has ever made my feet and legs feel so good.</li>
      <li>it feels better than when I go and get a professional pedicure</li>
      <li>I think it is worth the price too.</li>
      <li>I really love all the products included in this kit, and just recently I went to a nail salon</li>
      <li>I have tried many different foot care products, but none of them seemed to help my feet.</li>
      <li>Being my first using tea tree</li>
      <li>I was amazed how well it worked the first time.</li>
      <li>Investing in this pedicure kit has put my mind at ease, and has also saved me so much money!</li>
      <li>Bought this for my mom, she loves it, most especially the foot scrub.</li>
      <li>Now that it is getting hot out, my feet seem to be drying out.</li>
      <li>I first started looking into DIY pedicures after reading articles and seeing news segments about how unsanitary nail salons can be.</li>
      <li>This is now on the top of my gift list for future occasions.</li>
      <li>I tried this for the first time tonight</li>
      <li>I think this is a great set overall for those with damaged, dry feet!</li>
      <li>Its organic and vegan,it smells good and the bottles are big enough.</li>
      <li>And it shipped pretty fast.</li>
      <li>Not only are my feet back to being smooth, but I can&#x27;t stop using this product!</li>
      <li>Made my feet very soft!  </li>
      <li>It is light and does not clog my pores, but rich enough to actually add some moisture back in.  </li>
      <li>The scrub and lotion are both made in the USA, and are clearly the highlights of this set.</li>
      <li>and my feet haven&#x27;t felt this baby soft in years.  </li>
      <li>: I use this first, and it completly takes of the dry skin!    </li>
      <li>I have had super dry feet and cracked heels as long as I can remember</li>
      <li>Works really good on tired dry feet!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, especially for someone who normally has dry, calloused feet.</li>
      <li>Tea tree oil cooling foot scrub: It is really grainy, and I rub it all over my feel, and it takes all the dry skin off!   </li>
      <li>Everything you could possibly need is in here, including clear instructions.</li>
      <li>My only complaint would be that the lotion bottle was open when I opened the package and some of the lotion had spilled out, but that&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault. :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The set is nice &amp; used frequently.</li>
    <li> Is not like shown on the picture. I was hoping to see the three lotions shown in the picture and all I got was a set of nail clippers, a little bag of tea three oil and a rock.</li>
    <li> I love this gift package !! I am going to use it as a giveaway at baby shower- greta price and quality brand. I found out about this brand like 8 years ago at a baby shower and I still have the pedicure kit ( it gets a lot of usage!!).</li>
    <li> I received this set as a present years ago and am hooked on the brand.  Purchased this same gift set for my dance teacher&#x27;s Christmas present.  Was delivered quickly and well packed.  Makes a great gift for others and for yourself!  Perfect for those you like to be pampered a bit without spending a fortune!</li>
    <li> It works just as it is suppose to. its just like getting a pedicure at the salon, but instead it in your own home. I really love it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> he loves them and works great</li>
    <li> Earth Therapeutics makes some awesome products and this one does not disappoint. I love all of the products that come in this pedicure kit. They well, smell amazing and are easy to use. It&#x27;s a great way to keep up with your feet in between pedicures</li>
    <li> I bought this kit as a birthday gift for my fiance.He works security so he&#x27;s just standing most of the time,walking around for hours.&lt;br /&gt;I love this kit.Its organic and vegan,it smells good and the bottles are big enough.Theres everything you need to take care of your feet.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my husband for father&#x27;s day , since he doesn&#x27;t want to go get a pedicure, i decided to give him one at home and this is SUPER GOOD !!&lt;br /&gt;he really love it so now he wants a pedicure every 2 weeks !!</li>
    <li> I love the moisturizer, it&#x27;s fantastic.  It&#x27;s a great kit, it just isn&#x27;t worth the price they&#x27;re asking here.  I actually found it in my local supermarket in the beauty section for several dollars cheaper a couple weeks after I bought it here.</li>
    <li> This is a great little kit. I love the smell of the products and my skin feels wonderful after using it.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I am a BIG fan of pampering feet! Now that it is getting hot out, my feet seem to be drying out. This is when I ran across this item! I need products that will basically repair my feet!    I have been using this product for about 1 month now. Not only are my feet back to being smooth, but I can&#x27;t stop using this product! I really love all the products included in this kit, and just recently I went to a nail salon and they asked me how I got my feet so smooth!    Let me now explain What I like about all the products:    Tea tree oil cooling foot scrub: It is really grainy, and I rub it all over my feel, and it takes all the dry skin off!   Foot Repair Balm: Smoothed out my feet, and helped it to become less dried and cracked on the heel of my foot! Made my feet very soft!  Mini Pedicure set: Great for travel!  Pumice stick: I use this first, and it completly takes of the dry skin!    I think the scents are great if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents. I think this is a great set overall for those with damaged, dry feet!</li>
    <li> I love this kit!  It did the most amazing things to my feet.  The tea tree oil foot repair balm is worth its weight in gold!  I would definitely recommend this kit to anyone looking to repair their feet.</li>
    <li> I sent the pedicure kit as a gift have since received numerous compliments and &#x27;thank-you&#x27;.  This is now on the top of my gift list for future occasions.</li>
    <li> This has everything you need to make your feet (and hands) feel wonderful.  The tea tree in this feels great!!!  I love how this company is free from animal products or testing.  Vegan safe :).  I rub this lotion all over my face &amp; body and have for years.  It is light and does not clog my pores, but rich enough to actually add some moisture back in.  I use the foot scrub on my legs and arms.  It is not just for feet!  The value of this kit is great, considering the lotion in it is worth half this price :).</li>
    <li> Sent this to my mom for mother&#x27;s day. She loved it! Couldn&#x27;t stop raving about how good the product smelled. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> What a great kit for total foot care; contains everything needed to both repair damaged feet and to keep them in great shape.</li>
    <li> This kit contains everything you need for pedicure. Along with this kit I bought a foot spa and a foot soak and I&#x27;m planning on giving this to my mom as a mother&#x27;s day present</li>
    <li> I bought this as a last minute Christmas gift and didn&#x27;t expect it to come before Christmas.  But it did.</li>
    <li> This product is great, but the price here is too high.  Bed Bath &amp; Beyond carries this same set for only 19.99.</li>
    <li> It was okay for the price. Its not like a must have thing but it was cool.yea yea yea yea</li>
    <li> Came in 4 days, very happy with the product. Found out I could have bought it at Marshall&#x27;s for $15, but that&#x27;s just my own fault for not looking around.</li>
    <li> I first started looking into DIY pedicures after reading articles and seeing news segments about how unsanitary nail salons can be. I love getting pedicures, but the idea of getting fungus infections is terrifying. Investing in this pedicure kit has put my mind at ease, and has also saved me so much money! Everything you could possibly need is in here, including clear instructions. I highly recommend this budget-friendly kit filled with great Earth Therapeutics products.</li>
    <li> I like almost all the products in the bag.  I use the tea tree oil lotion a lot at night time.</li>
    <li> It has everything in it to do your own pedicure at home.  I&#x27;ve used it about 3 times and just love it.</li>
    <li> My feet were so rough and dry. I have tried many different foot care products, but none of them seemed to help my feet. So, one day I was just browsing here on Amazon and came across this product and thought I might as well give this a try as well. Low and behold... my feet have never been so soft and looked amazing. No more dry cracked heels.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit, great price and really works for tired feet</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom, she loves it, most especially the foot scrub. I paired it with coupons to the spa and it made for a great gift.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving it 4 stars, is the price. This can be found for a lower price in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyonds. Otherwise, it is great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!  I have had super dry feet and cracked heels as long as I can remember and I have tried everything I can possibly think of with not a lot of luck.  I tried this for the first time tonight and my feet haven&#x27;t felt this baby soft in years.  The smell totally relaxed me.  I soaked my feet in a warm water, vinegar mixture for about 20 minutes.  Then I used the pumice stone scrubber, followed by the scrub.  I trimmed my nails and tamed my cuticles with the pedicure kit and then finished with the lotion.  I plan to do this 2-3 times a week for the rest of this month and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results. Fantastic product- it feels better than when I go and get a professional pedicure and I was able to do it from home.  Try it!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> this product met my criteria.  they arrived in excellent shape and were exactly as described on Amazon.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> My feet are perfect after I use this kit. It has a cool minty smell which i like. And it shipped pretty fast. I think it is worth the price too.</li>
    <li> The scrub and pumice stone don&#x27;t remove all the dead skin and the lotion doesn&#x27;t do a great job either</li>
    <li> Cute set, definitely with buy another :)</li>
    <li> I love to take relaxing times at home, and this product is perfect for that porpuse.</li>
    <li> Above expectations!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very nice packaging and off course Earth therapeutics products are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for my mom.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cure my horrible, dry, summer feet. After just one use, my feet were SO much better! After using it for a week, my feet were as good as new again! Now I only give myself the pedicure (using only these products) about once a week to maintain my soft feet! My only complaint would be that the lotion bottle was open when I opened the package and some of the lotion had spilled out, but that&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault. :)</li>
    <li> I received this set for my birthday. I usually have very dry, even cracked, heels. After using these products one time, I saw a noticeable difference in the softness and appearance of my feet. The scrub and lotion are both made in the USA, and are clearly the highlights of this set. I love how the menthol in the scrub brings a freshness that the product would have otherwise lacked. I give it 4 stars only because the pumice stone (made in China) wasn&#x27;t made well. The stone didn&#x27;t fit into the handle correctly, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to fall off and I&#x27;ll have to glue it back on. This minor inconvenience is the only negative thing about this pedicure set. I highly recommend it, especially for someone who normally has dry, calloused feet.</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t afford to get a pedicure or if you just want to touch up before your next one, this has everything it takes to give yourself a great  pedicure, everything except the water and towels, that is.</li>
    <li> Great kit! Works really good on tired dry feet! Would recommend this product to anyone that needs help smoothing and moisturizing their feet!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit as a gift, but I&#x27;ve been using Earth Therapeutics foot products for years and they are absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> I give this product this rating after using the products in an evening of having a foot-cial. My honey and I enjoyed this together and our feet were SO soft and felt wonderful. I would recommend this product to everyone!! Try it, you&#x27;ll definitely like it.</li>
    <li> All you need in foot care - soothing, relaxing, stimulating. This is the perfect solution&lt;br /&gt;to giving yourself a pedicure.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Everything you need for a pedicure</li>
    <li> makes excellent gift for older mothers who love to pamper themselves. i got this for my mother-in-law and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Excellent home pedicure kit</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my daughter.  Her feet are looking better.</li>
    <li> Being my first using tea tree I was amazed how well it worked the first time. I have tried every product or at least most and nothing  has ever made my feet and legs feel so good. I use the soak a couple times a week just because it makes my tired feet and legs so relaxed leaving my feet so soft.</li>
