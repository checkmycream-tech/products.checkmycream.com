      <li>This product has a nice fragrance</li>
      <li>Garnier smell really nice and don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but this smells like something you&#x27;d find in an auto shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>smells nice too</li>
      <li>this lotion is really nice.  </li>
      <li>this one is great cause it has exactly what i need at this time in my life.</li>
      <li>I love that it contains SPF 20, too.</li>
      <li>Most things I&#x27;ve used by</li>
      <li>I love that it has sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Its more smoothing than de&#x3D;wrinkling..</li>
      <li>but, the most benefit is that my makeup goes on smoother.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love that even when I forgot it for a couple days on vacation, the fine lines did not return.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin firmer and helps get rid of fine lines.  </li>
      <li>works good on my very mature skin.  </li>
      <li>It smells like someone smoked a cigarette and tried to cover it up with cheap flowery perfume.  </li>
      <li>plus i got it for a cheap price, which is always a plus.</li>
      <li>I have noticed the differences after one week of use, and am excited to see what will happen after 4 weeks of use.    </li>
      <li>I love that this really does plump mouth lines.  </li>
      <li>Glides on and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>but well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>This is good for all skin tones and can be used in combination with other skin benefiting treatments.</li>
      <li>Initially impressed by the clean, pleasant smell, but product did not improve my skin any more than much less expensive, simple moisturizers.</li>
      <li>so you really don&#x27;t get the full amount you think you are.</li>
      <li>The product delivers exactly as it states.  </li>
      <li>Just be sure to give it several minutes to soak in.</li>
      <li>Also, the cleaning towelettes are heavenly soft and work great to remove eye makeup without excessive rubbing.</li>
      <li>I have been using Garnier deep wrinkle ultra Pro, so far my skin is very smooth and seems hydrated but the lines are still there.</li>
      <li>I use Garnier products exclusively after much trial and researching.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very well and can be used under foundation, resulting in a glowing skin.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>just what I wanted, fast delivery</li>
      <li>The SPF does work very well though.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>Whether or not it helped firm my skin, truthfully, I can&#x27;t tell.  </li>
      <li>The facial cream has my skin looking younger and feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>I would reccommend this cream for mature women who want softer smoother skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is not that sensitive, but it does appear to be rejecting this product because of the way it clogs my pores.</li>
      <li>I am a 15 year ex smoker, early 30s and have used everything on the market.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to get past the smell enough to see if it improves my skin.</li>
      <li>Compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried, it is a very thick cream, and it goes on very smoothly.</li>

<li> Compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried, it is a very thick cream, and it goes on very smoothly.</li>
<li> It most definitely is too greasy for me, even in the cold, dry, winter months.  </li>
<li> but it goes on a little greasy and after using it for several wks I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m still not sure if this is the actual product or if there is something else in this container.</li>
<li> No funny smell.</li>
<li> so I can&#x27;t comment on that part, but this product does what it says it will do to firm up the saggy skin at the jaw line and for the dry patch I was getting on my neck under the jaw.</li>
<li> It is so bad I even wondered if the seller was a dud and had filled the tub with something other than Garnier and sold it on, but I see another reviewer thought it smelt of cigarettes too</li>
<li> I would prefer that the fragrance be less perfumey</li>
<li> Lots of little bumps all over my face.</li>
<li> The bottle is not filled to the bottom...</li>
<li> Use it everyday under my makeup.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always used Olay products before but never found one to firm my skin like the Garnier Ultra Lift does.</li>
<li> /&gt;Whatever it is seems to at least be holding up to the &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; aspect of the promise.  </li>
<li> It has a chemical scent like &amp;#34;old smoke&amp;#34;, nothing like my usual Garnier Ultra-Lift Pro product !&lt;</li>
<li> it has a false inside</li>
<li> It does say in 4 weeks lines will deminish, so wait for the results before buying this expensive product.</li>
<li> This stuff smells like stale tobacco.</li>
<li> This has to be a fake!</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works against wrinkles, but it smells awful.  </li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s very expensive.  </li>
<li> br /&gt;Very disappointing!</li>
<li> I can smell it for quite a while after putting it on my face and it is disgusting.</li>

    <li> Initially impressed by the clean, pleasant smell, but product did not improve my skin any more than much less expensive, simple moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I am a 15 year ex smoker, early 30s and have used everything on the market.  I love that this really does plump mouth lines.  I love that it has sunscreen.  I love that even when I forgot it for a couple days on vacation, the fine lines did not return.  I have to say that of all of the anti aging products that \\&quot;common\\&quot; women can afford, this tops the chart.  Others I have had good experience with are Oil of Olay Serum and Merlot which is sold at Walgreens.    Don&#x27;t get discouraged ladies; it took about 2 weeks before I saw results but well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> works good on my very mature skin.  Its more smoothing than de&#x3D;wrinkling..if thats the word.  I purchased several so I can use it on my arms and hands.  Definitely better than the expensive lotions.  I like Garnier products.  I would reccommend this cream for mature women who want softer smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I just bought this cream so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works against wrinkles, but it smells awful.  It smells like someone smoked a cigarette and tried to cover it up with cheap flowery perfume.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to get past the smell enough to see if it improves my skin.</li>
    <li> This has to be a fake! It has a chemical scent like &amp;#34;old smoke&amp;#34;, nothing like my usual Garnier Ultra-Lift Pro product !&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> This product has a nice fragrance but it goes on a little greasy and after using it for several wks I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I use Garnier products exclusively after much trial and researching. They never disappoint. This cream is wonderful. Glides on and absorbs quickly. No funny smell. Makeup glides on after application. Would recommend to anyone. Worth the price. Actually could not believe how inexpensive it is.</li>
    <li> I have been using Garnier deep wrinkle ultra Pro, so far my skin is very smooth and seems hydrated but the lines are still there. It does say in 4 weeks lines will deminish, so wait for the results before buying this expensive product. I will update you next week again.</li>
    <li> I love it. It absorbs very well and can be used under foundation, resulting in a glowing skin. I would prefer that the fragrance be less perfumey but the fragrance does dissipate after a while. I am 59 and was looking for an affordable firming lotion for my puffy jaw line, and one that I didn&#x27;t wind up being allergic to. I don&#x27;t have fine-line wrinkles so I can&#x27;t comment on that part, but this product does what it says it will do to firm up the saggy skin at the jaw line and for the dry patch I was getting on my neck under the jaw. I have noticed the differences after one week of use, and am excited to see what will happen after 4 weeks of use.    Also, the cleaning towelettes are heavenly soft and work great to remove eye makeup without excessive rubbing. The cleaner didn&#x27;t leave a gooey feeling in my eyes. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried Garnier products, and I&#x27;m very happy with them. I&#x27;ve always used Olay products before but never found one to firm my skin like the Garnier Ultra Lift does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now.  It definitely did nothing for the look of my wrinkles.  I never saw any plumping up of my facial lines.  Whether or not it helped firm my skin, truthfully, I can&#x27;t tell.  It most definitely is too greasy for me, even in the cold, dry, winter months.  It just sits on my skin, and my face looks and feels greasy.  I will not buy this again.  I did not like it.  The SPF does work very well though.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for the price.  It seems to relax lines and wrinkles but, the most benefit is that my makeup goes on smoother.  It does not separate my makeup but supports the color.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  It&#x27;s not watery.  I think it&#x27;s very expensive.  The bottle is not filled to the bottom... it has a false inside so you really don&#x27;t get the full amount you think you are.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted, fast delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and I get compliments on my skin often. I love that it contains SPF 20, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like stale tobacco. I can smell it for quite a while after putting it on my face and it is disgusting. It is so bad I even wondered if the seller was a dud and had filled the tub with something other than Garnier and sold it on, but I see another reviewer thought it smelt of cigarettes too and that was 2 years ago. I don&#x27;t know if I can tolerate putting it so close to my nose until the pot runs out. Don&#x27;t buy it. It is nothing like the SPF 15 Ultra Lift one I had before.</li>
    <li> Great SPF coverage and love garnier products this one is great cause it has exactly what i need at this time in my life. smells nice too</li>
    <li> this lotion is really nice.  plus i got it for a cheap price, which is always a plus. i would buy this again.</li>
    <li> A moisturizer with the benefits of retinol. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores, it protects your skin from the harmful rays of the sun whilst replenishing it with youthfulness and trusted ingredients. Garnier seems to nail delivery every time. This is good for all skin tones and can be used in combination with other skin benefiting treatments.</li>
    <li> The smell is so antiseptic and medicated that it&#x27;s almost nauseating!  Burns one&#x27;s eyes!</li>
    <li> The facial cream has my skin looking younger and feeling smooth. I would recommend this facial cream  to my friends</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a great moisturizer?  I wish I could afford this cream all the time.  The product delivers exactly as it states.  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  It makes my skin firmer and helps get rid of fine lines.  Use it everyday under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Never greasy and works like a charm!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if this is the actual product or if there is something else in this container. Most things I&#x27;ve used by Garnier smell really nice and don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but this smells like something you&#x27;d find in an auto shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever it is seems to at least be holding up to the &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; aspect of the promise.  Compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried, it is a very thick cream, and it goes on very smoothly. Just be sure to give it several minutes to soak in. My skin is not that sensitive, but it does appear to be rejecting this product because of the way it clogs my pores. Lots of little bumps all over my face. It doesn&#x27;t cause any reddening, itching, or allergic type reactions though. If I continue to give this product a shot, it might just become my night cream until it runs out. I will not buy this product again.</li>
