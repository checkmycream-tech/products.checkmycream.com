    <li> I love this table, in the future I&#x27;d like to get a bigger one but this will be just fine for now.</li>
    <li> Such good quality! Great price! Very timely shipping! I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who enjoys doing her and her friends nails and she really likes it. It&#x27;s was easy to ensemble and is easy for her to set up or take down to save space. The one thing they could Improve would be put some sort of locking mechanism on the legs and a stop that keeps the drawer on the bottom from coming out the other side. Other then that it it&#x27;s a very nice affordable option.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  I received this was was excited to assemble it and use it in my studio.  However I was not able to do so due to the fact there is a screw missing for the arm rest, the legs are bent and it is so unstable there is no possible way to do a manicure.</li>
    <li> Very good quality portable table. Easy to set up. Make sure legs lock in secure before rolling it .</li>
    <li> I brought the table for my mom because she does a lot of manicures but does them at the kitchen table.  She absolutely loved the table it was nice and sturdy, I was afraid that it wasn&#x27;t going to be because it fits in the carry bag, but it was sturdy.  Customer service was prompt when I had a question they responded immediately.  I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this table except that I wish it came with hole covers for the people (like me) who decide not to put the arm rest on it. I haven&#x27;t used the bag or traveled with it so I can&#x27;t speak to that aspect other than saying that the bag seems nice and sturdy. This is a great table size and useful for more than just manicuring.</li>
    <li> The table was perfect . My granddaughter loves to do manicures. She is only 6years old but is an old pro at giving everyone manicures.&lt;br /&gt;She has everything set up and the table is just great.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my niece who&#x27;s attending manicure classes.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> Really great product would fully recommend</li>

    <li> So far, so good. Wheels could roll better, but other than that it gets the job done. The price was very good.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed Nail Technician and use this portable manicure table to provide services for client parties at other locations other than at my salon. It has a large work space and the drawer is a plus!</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly for me. Good size, I have a lamp on it &amp; it still is enough room for me to do my nails &amp; others. The arm pad offers comfort. The draw is good enough size to hold my nail files, buffers, manicure sticks, &amp; design brushes. The acetone proof enamel on table is a plus since I use acetone on removing my gel polish. I got it for it&#x27;s portablilty so this way I can slide it under my bed or pack it in the bag to take over for a &amp;#34;Girl Nail Party&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Table was described perfectly with dimensions and additions. Fits the needs of the person who received it. Portability is a plus!!</li>
    <li> i like it a lot but one corner was chipped off when i got it and sometimes the leg bends over without me wanting it to. other than that i love it!!</li>
