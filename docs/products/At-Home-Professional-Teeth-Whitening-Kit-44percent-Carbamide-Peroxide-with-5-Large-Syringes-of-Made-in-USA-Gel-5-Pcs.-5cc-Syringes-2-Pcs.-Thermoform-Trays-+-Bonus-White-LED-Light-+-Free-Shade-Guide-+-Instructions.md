<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered one with 10 syringes but only got 5.  I did this three times.  The product does work but I am not fond of the process.  I just use the stuff as toothpaste when I brush and it seems to work well enough.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once and have been told my teeth look whiter. Comes with easy to follow instructions and works great. So glad I got this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have noticed a significant difference in the color of my teeth within just a few days of use.  I personally don&#x27;t use the trays I just put a little of the product on my teeth avoiding my gums (I made the mistake of getting it on my gums and it burns fyi) and using the light.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product worked just as expected, no sensitivity and i struggle with sensitivity already. This is good for anyone who wants to whiten their smile, cheap and dosent cause sensitivity! :)</li>
    <li> Strong but works. Don&#x27;t get on gums!</li>
    <li> This product is very cheap the screw keeps falling out and it burns my nails.</li>
    <li> For the price, and what you get, this kit is awesome.  You get a ton of gel and it would probably even be enough for 2 people or more- unless you had really yellow teeth and needed a lot of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS- you only need to put a tiny dot of whitening gel in the tray for each tooth (you mold the trays so you can see the outline of your teeth).  If you put in a whole line of gel, it will probably be too much and cause some sensitivity problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth, you might want to get a lower % of peroxide.  OR get some remineralizing gel which you can use with the teeth trays from this kit.  That helps a lot with the sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Works great, thanks a ton!</li>
    <li> Ow wow, I got REALLY good results with this!  This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it.  MY teeth are noticeably whiter.  I re-order the batteries off of Amazon; for $8.26 I can get 4 of the needed batteries (the units take 3 batteries) at Walmart. OR I can order a blister pack of 20 (maybe it was 30) for the same price.  No brainer.  Rock on Amazon!</li>
    <li> works great just keep it off your gums cause it will become uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Can see the difference already!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Works like a charm, but trim those trays to clear your gums or you will end up with white spots.</li>
    <li> so first use my teeth were noticeably whiter,  All though I did follow with all the other comments and rather then using the tray I painted the gel on carefully with a Q-tip.  This works way better then any strip you can buy.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. My teeth were already pretty white, i was just wanting to remove some coffee stains. I just did my second treatment and my teeth are very white. Im so excited. I had no sensitivity. . But after reading the reviews i applied the gel thickly but with a quip.  Then i placed the mouth pieces over it. I was careful to avoid my gums and lips.  Will definitely recommend.  Works better then the white strips and at half the price</li>
    <li> Great!! This products has worked amazingly for me. My teeth were 2 shades whiter in less than two weeks of using. Over-usage does really hurt your gums, so use it cautiously! Im sure it works differently for everyone though.</li>
    <li> Very painful on the gums, but results are visible!</li>
    <li> It works really well and was so easy to use it. the instructions are really clear and if you follow it you will get great results. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Would have rated it higher but the light is either broken or the batteries are dead.  I did get three mouth trays though (don&#x27;t need the third - would rather have had a working light).  It does cause some sensitivity for a few days but I expected that because the strength is so high.  Good value overall.</li>
    <li> When I opened my package I found that 1 syringe was leaking. It leaked all inside the bag. Also it smelled weird/bad. My package came with no instructions. Content of bag was 5 syringes, 3 plastic mouth pieces and 1 blue light.</li>
    <li> Light never worked and the peroxide didn&#x27;t work- try Crest strips or such for a better whitening product.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time and was the same as what was shown in pictures. The tooth whitening worked great! I could see a difference after the first time.</li>
    <li> with consistent use this product works. I like to start with the tray and then use the light.so far I have had no tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> the whitening chart and light, love. but the gel burned.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the product and the packaging. Included directions are very detailed and clear. A lot of warnings about how strong the product is. So far, I have been using the kit twice in the past 5 days (about 15 minuntes per session). I have noticed a big difference in whitening. I had very little irritation on my gums when I put intoo much gel. I can definitely recommend this cool kit.</li>
    <li> I was able to see an improvement on my teeth. This stuff really works for the price. A little does go a long way as someone mention also I used the q-tip worked great for me!</li>
    <li> So far so good. It was priced great and seems to be working good. Delivered fast.</li>
    <li> It has worked really good for me. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and you can really see the difference</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works well. I do not have a cold sensitivity like hydrogen peroxide whiteners cause. Just use minimal amounts to keep it off your gums. They will burn.</li>
    <li> This is a very strong product, I think this is comparable to what dentists use. If you know what you are getting, you will be careful with it. I was able to whiten my teeth very well in only two applications. I had very little sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Not please with product at all!!</li>
    <li> This is my very first time ordering teeth whitening through Amazon. And this has been a 5 stars experience all the way. Fast delivery and very well packaged too. I received easy to follow instructions. The gel whitened my teeth 2 shades just with one treatment. I have previously bought very expensive products through my dentist and they were not as effective. This is much much better in every way.</li>
    <li> Had trouble with my first package, got another one and I must admit I love it. Very professional company and they Will make sure you are satisfied with the product. If you get a chance buy it you won&#x27;t regret it. I&#x27;ve seen results after a week.</li>
    <li> With all respects, this product doesnt really change whitening, its kinda like using some led on your theeth! Maybe i wasted the money on this!!</li>
    <li> I got great results.  Gum soarness was expected.  So I did the treatment every 3rd or 4th day.  But I could see results with each treatment.  Definitely cheaper than a dentist treatment and simple to use</li>
    <li> So I was extremely nervous trying this product! When I received it I read a lot of reviews good and bad so I was so scared I was going to be in pain or such, even though the good reviews out way to bad. With that being said I did take some tips from some of the reviewers so thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package I read the VERY WELL put instructions guide, which was very helpful. I then did a test run with the guards and boiled some water. This part is really easy for me since both my son and husband fight so I am always doing new mouth guards. ** As a tip don&#x27;t bring the water to a full boil just under a boil, place your guards in and pull out after a few seconds and place in your mouth. This is what I do with their guards and did it with these and worked great.** Once my guards were set I flossed and brushed my teeth as well as dried my teeth and DID NOT CLOSE MY MOUTH. I was very worried about getting it on my gums so I took Q-tips and placed a little at a time. It says right in the instructions a little goes a long way! This is not a lie at all!!! I only left it on with the light for 3 minutes because it was my first time and I am already seeing a great difference in my teeth. I was a smokier for years and I drink coffee, and I am promising you my teeth look whiter!! I did use water to swish around my mouth after and also lightly brushed my teeth. This is well worth the money just actually read the directions and don&#x27;t over fill your tray! I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygiene and have had years of experience with bleaching products. I found the 44 percent to be to consentrated and made my teeth sensititive for days even after I stopped useing it and treating my teeth with Fl</li>
    <li> It does work but The gel is very powerfull . It burned the hell out of my gums.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review back in February when I first received this product.  My order was late but that was due to bad weather up north, which someone called to explain. So my review was based on that. Since then I have received numerous calls and emails asking to remove my negative review because it makes the product look bad. Well this was my experience- the trays were horrible as soon as I put them in hot water they almost melted away. I didn&#x27;t notice any chance and I used them two different times. The blue light that comes with it didn&#x27;t help, however unlike most people who experienced sore gums I didn&#x27;t. I made sure to stay away from my gums since I read the reviews. I hope this helps but in my opinion I got better results with crest 3D white strips.</li>
    <li> this works fantastic first time around.  i could definitely tell the difference in just one use.  i am a coffee drinker and these made me smile again.  i was shying away from smiling bc i am a busy mom and well hadn&#x27;t brightened my teeth in years!  i am so happy with this so glad i bought this.  my husband really liked this and worked wonders for him!  his was a better outcome on the first try it was actually amazing i cant wait to do his again.  the only caution is DON&#x27;T DO what i did and do it 3 times in one day for 30 minutes.  Now this part you can do, i applied the gel directly to my teeth then i put the trays on then the light.  i didn&#x27;t mold the trays either and it worked fine but the trick is to apply a good coat to your teeth all around the teeth then set in the tray and then the light. Continuing on with my over zealous move yesterday...  I didn&#x27;t feel tooth sensitivity yesterday but i definitely did today - my teeth are more sensitive than most bc i was in a car wreck and hit my teeth (they have hairline cracks). Overall, i am so very happy i got this and  that it works so well!</li>
    <li> It is very very difficult to avoid even the smallest amount of gel rubbing onto your gum. When this happens an extremely painful burning begins. Within 2 minutes the area that had a little gel turned red then white. When I say my gums started to burn i mean extreme pain. It burned for 24 hrs after.</li>
    <li> Sucks. I used just as said and well nothing. not even one shade lighter</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening kit is one of the few in-home whitening programs that I actually feel confident in and feel that it is working. Within a couple treatments, I could tell that it is already working and I feel confident that if I stick with the regiment, that it would whiten my teeth even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the blue light that came with my kit was faulty when it first arrived. Although I got it replaced easily through Amazon, a few weeks later, it stopped working - so I had to purchase a new kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying teeth whiteners for years and let me tell you - this is by far the greatest deal I have ever found.  In one week my teeth look professionally whitened.  Oh make sure to cut off the tabs on the trays and insert the light inside under your lips and don&#x27;t go more than 15-20 minutes with the light - else your gums will bleach lol.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as picture on Amazon and does exactly what it was designed to do.  I would recommend this item to anyone looking to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, works really good. Everything was perfect. Will be purchasing again. &amp; pictures coming soon.</li>
    <li> WOW, works better than what I got at the dentist and a whole lot less expensive. I am a coffee and red wine drinker. Whitening is a necessary thing in my life. I have used many whitening products and have had my teeth professionally whitened. This product works better then anything I&#x27;ve gotten from dentists and after a couple applications I think it is equal to the results from my in office treatments. I will definitely be back for more and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> excellent seller will buy again</li>
    <li> Still not a replacement for a real teeth whitening procedure but it is fine for the price. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hi everyone, this product is a nightmare, don&#x27;t even try it. Burns your gum after 2 mns of use, and very long process 40 mns everyday and complicated procedures. So go for something else.</li>
    <li> this product does work. I have used two syringes so far and I  can see a huge difference. I was kind of Leary about trying teeth whitening products there is so many that doe not work and stripe your teeth causing pain and sensitivity this one does not. I highly recommend it. It comes with two pack in one.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth, and started using this at a minimum 2 min increasing up to 8 or nine minutes in a couple weeks. Can&#x27;t seem to keep it on any longer, because my teeth ache later in the day.. They have lightened some. Going to keep trying, because I think it&#x27;s a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Works great and they send you so much of the gel I&#x27;m set or life lol it&#x27;s the one teeth whitner system I&#x27;ve found that actually works!</li>
    <li> Does what it says  the price I have enough supplies for the year. I have not used them much, yet, so have yet to see positive results. Love my coffee, too much.</li>
    <li> Really works first try. Amazing so happy with this product really made my teeth white no joke. I highly recommend to anyone with stained or yellow teeth</li>
    <li> I only used it a couple of times,,, but did not stay committed. Bad on &amp;#34;MY&amp;#34; behalf. Thanks surely rhat it had to work. Not easy or fast. But stay committed to see results.</li>
    <li> received on time and performs well.</li>
    <li> this product is very strong and gave me a lot of pain and sensitivity up to half hour after using.</li>
    <li> I see my Dentist EVERY 6 months!!  My teeth were white, but I wanted a bit more Whitening, and this system worked great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED light fits good, and cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS...  This may be a bit strong for some people, read the directions for advice.  I can use the Whitening for about 30 mins on my top teeth, but only 20 mins on the bottom.  IF your gums burn, STOP, and rinse.  IF your gums turn White, it will go away in a few hours.</li>
    <li> I researched with my own dentist to find out what they use and I found this to be far less expensive than purchasing the trays and the solution from the from him.  It is exactly what you will find in a professional setting.  My only complaint is in the lower quality trays.  Buying properly molded trays from the dentist, rather than molding your own, will probably see better results.  Overall highly satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> I could not even tell I had used this product, my teeth looked the same, waste of money.  I used exactly as indicated</li>
    <li> The directions are not the best but after reading some of the reviews I started&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Applying the gel with a watercolor brush to target only the yellow areas of the visible front part of my teeth and stopped applying gel to the areas like the lower half &amp; the tips of some of my front teeth that were already visibly white&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I ended up not using the lower trays because they spread the gel on my gums causing them to painfully turn white or worse, recede!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I lay down without a pillow while being on a on a permanent &#x27;super wide smile&#x27; position for 30 mins - face muscles does get sore as well as arms from holding a mirror and the blue light that accelerates the breakdown of the carbamide peroxide&lt;br /&gt;Update: I stumbled upon an item called &#x27;Cheek Retractor&#x27; that helps hold your mouth wide and open like a mine shaft without getting too sore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I stopped drinking coffee entirely and use a straw to drink cola or ice tea, also experienced a bit of sensitivity, don&#x27;t brush your gums too hard!&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 3.8 stars because it is a little tedious &amp; time consuming but overall probably will be purchasing the gels again in two years from now if teeth gets noticeably yellow</li>
    <li> The light doesn&#x27;t work the trays didn&#x27;t mold well to my teeth which allows the whitening solution to ooze out onto my gums/mouth which not only tastes bad, isn&#x27;t good for you and creates a mess. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I can say from the first 15 minute session I can already see a difference not major but noticeable to me. I have a bad case of very yellow spots on my front teeth and I&#x27;m confedent in this product that it will soon be resulved. :) at first for the 2 min practice I did get it on my gums and right away I felt the irritation as decribed in the instructions. My gum turned white and it felt like a needle as going through it. :0 all was fine though I quickly removed my try and rinced my gum and the pain went away along with the white color. Shipping was great got the 2 day shipping and it came in a neat box and overall very well packaged. Please with my perches. Thank you very much :)</li>
    <li> The trays were very hard to form and the gel gets everywhere.  Quit after a few trys.</li>
    <li> I had been pricing and investigating tooth whitening products and ingredients for a couple of weeks when I found this product.  It is pretty much what they use in the dentist&#x27;s office and appears to work the same way. You have to be careful what you expose your teeth to for a day or two after application. I am seeing improvement after three or four five-minute applications.  A great deal for the price.  Don&#x27;t forget to store in the fridge if you&#x27;re not using it!</li>
    <li> One out of 2 of the adapters was broken.  It wouldn&#x27;t squeeze out.  I had to use a toothpick to get the gel out. The second one worked.  We&#x27;ll see about the others.</li>
    <li> Works great. Be careful not to get on your gums. It does not feel good. I use a q tip to apply to teeth and take rolled up gauze and cover gums. Since I started doing that I haven&#x27;t burnt my gums again.</li>
    <li> Great product..noticeable whiter teeth in just one week. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This stung quite a bit but it worked well. I have only used it once because when you use it you have to have a lot of free time on your hands to do it all...</li>
    <li> My teeth were noticeably whiter after the first use. I had some minor sensitivity the first couple uses but that has completely gone away. I&#x27;ve used it at least a dozen times and haven&#x27;t even used up the first syringe.</li>
    <li> I would like to start out by saying that I tried this product three times and It hasn&#x27;t whiten my teeth thats&lt;br /&gt;a concern to me you do have to be careful because it can burn your gums. I have stains on my teeth and&lt;br /&gt;this product didn&#x27;t work. The package came with directions but no phone number to speak with a live person.&lt;br /&gt;good luck</li>
    <li> This actually does work! I used it 2 days in a row for 30 minutes. I got tired of fooling with the light, so I gave up on that part. The light won&#x27;t go off unless you open the battery compartment. I saw a noticeable difference from some white dental work/fillings.  I was unable to use the trays because I gag easily. I bought a cheek retractor and just drooled while the gel was on my teeth. Of course, it does increase sensitivity, so I&#x27;d recommend getting a mineralization kit as well. (Found that here, too.) The inside of my lower lip got sore from the peroxide, but that was temporary.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This burned so bad immediately after inserting the trays in my mouth. There is NO way that it will not touch your gums.  I thought my mouth was on fire and it would not stop.  My gums were actually burned and changed color.  Never again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how to judge this kit, but it seems incomplete.  You get the gel, mouth guard, and UV light.  I&#x27;m not sure when to use the UV light with the mouth guard.  So I just did what I did with whitening lightening which was paint gel on teeth and use UV.  No mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above is my original review after one day with the product.  After a few days I can say this teeth whitening kit is 100% worth the 13$.  I don&#x27;t use the UV light, for it does give me some sensitivity.  I just use the molds for 20-30 minutes.  Wow, the whiteness.  It only takes a few treatments to notice the huge difference. I switched from whitening lightening because they got me from a 10 to a 5, but for whatever reason I couldn&#x27;t get lower.  With this though, I am almost a 1!</li>
    <li> The tooth whitening kits works just as promised! I was amazed at the results. I have spent hundred of dollars in dentists office years ago to get the same exact result. Wanting a touch up now ....the tooth whitening kit made it more affordable and more convient . I have and will recommend this product to anyone! Thanks for delivering what you promised and thats a beautiful WHITE smile without the hassle of dentists and there was NO burning because I used a Qtip and tissue that someone had recommended and NO trays!!!!! Fabulous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JR,&lt;br /&gt;South Carolina</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago. I did not remove it from the box  until this week.  JUST BE aware that it has a limited shelf life if not kept in the fridge. I was a week from the shelf life for non-fridge when I opened the box.  I Already HAVE whitening trays. I paid money on line to buy a kit that you use for CUSTOM trays. well worth the money. exactly what a dentist would use.  Then I bought the whitening gel here.  I have bought other gels in the past. the 10% and 15% white were worthless. yeah they made a difference but very limited and my gums burned and it hurt and made me very sensitive for months.  So I have used this product here 3 times.  I used it last week.  I had forgotten this item came with the blue light.  I am not sure if it helps or not.  I used the product for an hour the first time.  I could tell there was a difference on my teeth.  my teeth are not yellow but they are not white either.  My dentist has told me my teeth will only whiten so much.  I was happy with the first 1 hour treatment&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd time I went about 45 minutes.  Again there was a difference in teeth color.  That night it felt like I was having my teeth drilled because the gums were sensitive and they were triggering on their own.  It was not fun but I survived.  The pain was gone the next morning when I woke up.  I waited a week.  I just used the product a 3rd time.  I lasted 45 minutes with the light. I lay on my back on the sofa so the saliva doesn&#x27;t run around the gums and weaken the product while I have the trays in my mouth.  I am happy.  The color is not WHITE like you see from the movie stars with glued on veneer.  I might not ever get there.  ALL I can say is I paid $13 for 5 tubes and I see progress.  A LOT of progress.  $13 compared to about $250 to $300 at the dentist.  I have used about 1/2 to 3/4 of one tube in 3 uses.  That means I can expect 15 to 20 usages from the 5 tubes.  That comes out to less than $1 per treatment. IF this product was terrible then for $1that would be ok. BUT this product is EXCELLENT so I am getting an amazing deal for $1 each treatment.&lt;br /&gt;  Remember I said this was one week before the shelf life expiration and I still got these results.  I saw a lot of bad ratings here.  My suggestions.  LOOK on line and spend the money for custom dental trays.  They mail you the stuff, you put it in your mouth around your teeth and it dries. you mail it back and you get custom trays.  THEN BUY the gel here. You will be happy.  Again for this price it is a great deal. I will wait at least 5 more days before I use it again.  I hope my gums don&#x27;t hurt tonight but I will update. YES I RECOMMEND this!!</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening gel works wonders but is very intense. I recommend using a plastic dental mouth opener (buy one on amazon for $4.00) so you don&#x27;t get any on your gums because if you do trust me, it burns so bad and gives you bad gum sensitivity. The next product that I recommend is the CREST 3D WHITE TOOTHPASTE ($3.99 on amazon). If you use these products together it will truly give you the whitest smile you can have</li>
    <li> Received the kit about 2 week ago, I used it three times on successive days for 15 minutes each time. I kept track of the change of color on my teeth and the results are very very noticeable. I think, I got from shade 7 to shade 3. Now, I do not need to go any further but I have a lot of gel product left for later use. Very good value for a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> The kit came with a lot of gel and trays. I am not able to comment on the trays because I used my own custom trays from the dentist. But, the instructions about shaping the trays sound pretty easy to follow. May be I will just try the trays as well. The amount of gel included with the kit looks like it will last for at least 20-30 treatments. I am not sure but these tubes looks like double the size of what I got from the dentist for a fraction of the cost. I am happy with my purchase and I can recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It works but it doesn&#x27;t whiten as much as I thought it would so it has taken several times to lighten up my teeth.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference in my teeth after daily use, but it did make my mouth feel very clean</li>
    <li> I started using it as soon as it came and initially I wasn&#x27;t that impressed by the results - it worked but definitely not &amp;#34;professional grade.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did like the other reviews said and made sure that the gel actually got to where it as needed, the front of the teeth. Rather than brush the product on, I still use the trays but when I put the gel in there I make sure to put it mostly at the front part of the teeth rather than in the impressions themselves where the instructions say to. This way when you put the trays on, the gel will also get pushed up the front your teeth. This works great for me and the first time I did it this way I could definitely tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the light but have never tried without it so I can&#x27;t say for sure if that works or not - it&#x27;s not uncomfortable or anything so I&#x27;ll keep using it. I also had no problems with the trays, just followed the instructions and they molded to my teeth very well - took a couple of tries as I screwed up first but once I got it they fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with the results, especially given the price.</li>
    <li> This is more effect then other whitener products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Not as fast acting as I would have preferred.</li>
    <li> It Works! I was a bit skeptical at first. After using it for 15mins a day three days back to back I couldn&#x27;t see my teeth getting any whiter. It burned whenever I got it on my gums and I started to think that it wasn&#x27;t worth it. By day four however I started to see the improvement. After using it for two weeks my teeth got five shades whiter! They&#x27;re not movie star white but definitely whiter than they&#x27;ve ever been. And it comes with a lot! I only ended up using one syringe in the two week period so I have a lot left over. Every one or two weeks I apply it to my teeth again to maintain the whiteness and found that over time they&#x27;ve slowly gotten even whiter.</li>
    <li> Good, not great. But worth the $12</li>
    <li> I was very sceptical, and I have incredibly sensitive teeth, but this stuff works! I got a small amount on my gums though and it turned a portion of them white for a day. In one use for 15 minutes I noticed a difference! This stuff is strong. The instructions aren&#x27;t the best so if you have sensitive teeth like me I&#x27;d use it less than suggested in the instructions.</li>
    <li> Average. doesnt work any better than other products.  Slow to whiten, and only slight results seen.  It is thicker than other products.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many different teeth whitening systems, from Dentist varieties to drug store strips.  This is a very good price for a USA made teeth whitening kit.</li>
    <li> i cant tell if it works because the product burns my gums to bad to use it. I dont think its a bad product Im just to sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> I assume, as I haven&#x27;t heard otherwise that she is pleased with it. I like mine as it works as promised.</li>
    <li> Does Exactly As It States!</li>
    <li> I only got the whitening stuff no mouth trays or blue light</li>
    <li> It works. Made my smile brighter and worked quickly. I used the light then stopped using it because  it made no difference</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second kit, I used to purchase whitening gel from my dentist, but this has worked just as well! I noticed my teeth where lighter in only a few days. I now use occasionally for touch ups.</li>
    <li> I was use to purchasing through my dentist. This works just as good. I already had my own trays made for me. I did try trays and they will work.</li>
    <li> i got the product and used...&lt;br /&gt;but that make me so hurt and changed color my gum and burn gum!!&lt;br /&gt;OMG.. i have pain still now!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  It is a mouth guard with teeth whitening gel. Still worth the money since a mouth guard at the sporting good store is $5-$10 and you don&#x27;t get any teeth whitening gel.</li>
    <li> This product works really well I would purchase it again and I also recommend it</li>
    <li> Go to the dentist and get the trays made and then come back here and buy this stuff, hope that you get a fresh sample, then immediately place in the fridge. The trays you get with this are worthless and the gel expires easily</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money.  These trays do not form to your teeth AT All.  They pretty much just melt when you put them in the hot water.  Returning.</li>
    <li> Great product and whitens teeth.  Just be careful because the gel will cause sensitive teeth and cause the gums</li>
    <li> The molds suck but the whitening is&lt;br /&gt;Okay. Have other molds before you buy.</li>
    <li> good product, good price, works well</li>
    <li> It is very strong.  I paid $200 once from my dentist for a whitening kit and I&amp;#34;m not even sure it was as strong as this is.  READ The DIRECTIONS!  It will burn your gums fast if you put too much on.  Only use a tiny bit at first.  It&#x27;s all in the pamphlet.  The light didn&#x27;t work but I don&#x27;t really mind because I never believed that it actually helps.  The products doesn&#x27;t deserve a bad review because you were too lazy to read the directions.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t not whiten my teeth at all.</li>
    <li> The Gel is a bit too strong and harsh when it gets to your gums and the upper palate of the mouth, otherwise you should be patient in spreading the Gel as per instructions; any excess Gel will surely hurt your gums and palate. I use cling film and a piece of facial tissue to protect my Gums and palate. All together the Gel does work and takes effect in 4 - 5 days time.</li>
    <li> The trays were easy to mold and I noticed a difference in my teeth after just one use. Lots of whitner came with the kit. Blue light seems to work well also. I would recommend it. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> It had burned my fingers and gums dont get it.</li>
    <li> I tried the regular old white strips (even sheer white 20% peroxide)before giving this kit a try, the white strips just weren&#x27;t strong enough but this kit really boosted the whiteness of my teeth. I had no sensitivity but it can irritate the gums slightly. Overall i am very satisfied</li>
    <li> The price is the best I could find. It does come with a sheet of instructions and there is a web site address for DIY videos. The top of the trays were too tall for my teeth so I trimmed the top edges. Now they keep the product away from mu gums and there is no sensitivity on my gums. After only 2 treatments I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening product is great. I am so glad I bought this, my teeth are whiter than they have ever been....</li>
    <li> Product is easy to use and works very quick. I&#x27;ll definitely order this one again. Great price and great service. Thanks very much. Highly recommend.fast shipping.</li>
    <li> the trays are awful. they are too big and I gaged having them in my mouth. threw them away and just using the light now. however, the gel didn&#x27;t seem to work neither because I didn&#x27;t notice a single shade whiter. my teeth remain the same shade as there were. and the shade guide provided is ridiculous and threw that one away too. I hope the gel will kick in and start working since I used only one syringe and it is more than half full. anyways, I hope i&#x27;ll see better results and re-post my review but for now the light is the only thing that was worth the purchase. if I bought it separately, it would cost less though.</li>
    <li> The product is okay.  The plastic teeth doesn&#x27;t fit that great and it got bent.  So, I never finished using it.</li>
    <li> Burned my gums and my teeth dont stay white for that long.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product. And to me shaping the trays is the most important step of this whitening process. Make sure you trim the trays very close to your teeth. If the trays are not fit well, the gel will not touch your teeth but it will be all over your gums. You can try to apply gel directly on your teeth. May be with a little cotton swab or something?</li>
    <li> WELL, IT IS KIND OF HARD TO TELL IF MY TEETH ARE WHITENING UP OR NOT.  ALSO, I HAD SOME OF THE GEL GET ON MY GUMS IN THE FRONT AND IT WAS/IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SO I ORDERED A NEW MOUTHPIECE AND I AM HOPING THAT HELPS AND I AM EXCITED TO USE THE PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
    <li> The results of this product varies as it depends on how much stain is on your teeth. I didn&#x27;t have much stain so I really didn&#x27;t see a difference after one syringe application but I&#x27;ll use the rest for a final result.</li>
    <li> o.k. The mouth trays suck. I threw them out. Maybe its just the shape of my mouth, who knows? In just 5 uses my teeth are now as white as the whitest on the chart they give you. I roll a little paper towel and put it under top and bottom lip to keep my teeth showing and apply a little gel to my teeth using a q-tip. Then i put the light in my mouth and and hold it in place with my lips. Then i just watch tv for 20 min. Easy as pie. I didnt get any remineralization gel so i use sensitivity toothpaste once a week or so. I do not have any problems with pain or whitening of my gums. I dont know why some people are having problems with this product but so far so good for me. I will advise anyone to give this a try if they want white teeth.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different types of whitening systems with little to no results. I blame 30+ years of smoking and love my coffee. I purchased this expecting the same, but after 3 or 4 treatments I actually saw a difference. I used it daily for over a week and my teeth went from yellow to a dull white. Now, once a week or so I do another treatment and they are staying white. This by far is the best one yet. If you get the gel on your gums, wipe if off asap.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not do 5 stars is because my teeth did not get bright white.</li>
    <li> Great price and I&#x27;ve noticed instant results the two times I&#x27;ve used it.  Comes with a LOT of product...I put several syringes in the refrigerator hoping that will make them last.  It&#x27;s way more than I&#x27;ll use by myself in a year.</li>
    <li> Great whitening product! Agree with the other reviewers if applied directly to teeth helps reduce gum discomfort.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I did as other said and put the gel on my teeth then put the trays on them. I put in the light for 20 minutes, and my teeth are.now so white! I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t purchase again, not very user friendly</li>
    <li> The substance gets hard after a few weeks? Works but first few times turned gums white</li>
    <li> Whitten my teeth 6 shades whiter.  Better product then product your dentist gives. One from dentist did not work as expected but this one work very well. love it...  and we buy is again next year for the topup.</li>
    <li> This is very strong, probably what the dentist uses. You need to be careful not to use too much because it can burn your gums. It is very effective and comes with moldable tooth trays.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been whitening my teeth every summer for five years.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen great results in such a short time.  I received compliments after five treatments -- the first lasting 5 minutes and the last one about 20 minutes.  My teeth look so white, my husband and son asked that I order kits for them.  I have my own trays so the high Carbamide Peroxide percentage doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;ll definately buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced that the 5 star reviews on this product are paid for by the seller.  My package arrived in a padded envelope containing unwrapped syringes, a mouth tray, a whitening light, and a scrap of paper with a brief paragraph of instructions typed on it.  The lack of professionalism as far as the packaging was a little unsettling but hey, I&#x27;ll do anything for a great deal.  Well... NEVER AGAIN.  I had the product on for 3 minutes before I couldn&#x27;t stand the pain of the chemical burns on my gums which were nearly as bleached as my teeth.  Thankfully this was only temporary but I don&#x27;t even want to think about what would&#x27;ve happened if I had left it on for the full half hour like the instructions stated to.  As soon as I rinsed my mouth out, I threw the entire package in the trash.  This product is a complete waste of time and money.  From now on I&#x27;m sticking to good old pharmacy bought whitening products.  They may be pricier but they&#x27;re safer!</li>
    <li> this product is really cheap in comparison to other products but it works so well!! I would recommend anyone to try this</li>
    <li> It works great but watch out if you have sensitive gums ! Yikes. I wouldn&#x27;t use more than one per week.</li>
    <li> I had a little trouble making mouth trays like everyone else, and trimmed the upper tray down.  This helped a lot but I had to trim out spots where it now has no contact with the top part of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that my teeth are a heck of a lot whiter after using this product, because I can see spots i missed on my teeth that are a lot darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does burn, but use a lot less then you think you would need, be careful and leave on for 1-2 hours.  I know it says 30 minutes in the instructions but I got results with 1-2 hour sessions daily.  It can help to lie down and just watch tv to stop your mouth from salivating too much, I have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasted the first few syringes by using too much and wasting a lot of it, burning my gums, etc.  Maybe I have super strong teeth because my gums healed over night and i only get a little bit of sensitivity to cold air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t white white, but a lot brighter and a lot nicer looking.  I am not sure if you can ever fully bleach them at home to the fake white movie stars have, but I am about to buy another kit and find out!</li>
    <li> I am having resulsts but it seems slow.  I can only use for 1 hour each day and sometimes not that due to the mouth peice being so thick.</li>
    <li> Love the gel! Didn&#x27;t like the trays. I use the gel with trays from my dentist.</li>
    <li> Works great! and doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth at all, unlike crest whitening strips</li>
    <li> Worked great, visible improvement.  Foil package seems to work.</li>
    <li> I bought this for me, but didn&#x27;t work and I gave to my friend and worked it, not so white how you think will look. The best whitening is always at your dentist! But they refund my money back as well.</li>
    <li> Just started using, so far, it is working better than any other similar product I have tried.</li>
    <li> For the price- 5 stars... you get what you pay for. And that is a good thing. The ONLY thing I can think of at this point is how it burns my gums...I didn&#x27;t know they were as sensitive as they are. Which it may be my problem and not the products.... I didn&#x27;t use the trays at first (just brushed on the gel with a Q-tip) and that seemed to work alright... I decided to use the trays and they worked really well for me. Every person is different. Bottom line, I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> One syringe came damaged in the shipping. Otherwise good product. Very strong peroxide.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a hugh difference so far. I will say don&#x27;t put too much on, the taste is extremely bitter</li>
    <li> The solution is too strong for use without dentist supervision...will burn your gums if you&#x27;re not careful.  Make sure to use fluoride treatment after.  Wear for shorter time, but do more repetitions.  Wait a day between sessions.  The light they provide doesn&#x27;t really do anything but provide a thing to bite down on.</li>
    <li> Would never re-buy. Could not get the product to fit properly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping to improve the whiteness of my teeth and it has NOT done anything at all!! After 1 and 1/2 syringes I have noticed that this product has done nothing in the improvement of whitening my teeth. People have said they have burning or irritation of the gums where gel was touching them. I Felt nothing at at all, even a little tingle or something would have let me know it was working a little, but to have nothing and be 44% is unreal. If you purchase this product you are buying something that WILL NOT WORK AT ALL!! Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this. Save your money and search for a better product. I believe that these five star reviews as an effective product may be paid for.</li>
    <li> So I hear this is a great product, mine didn&#x27;t come with instructions. How exactly do you use this? Do you use the light with the trays or just the light alone?</li>
    <li> Very fast results and the price can´t be beaten!</li>
    <li> Excellent if you use it properly and follow directions, This is strong stuff... to prevent overfilling you can just put a little on each tooth then put the trays on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;A lot came in the kit ♡&lt;br /&gt;Can last you awhile</li>
    <li> This product was priced very reasonably. Got the items in good shape and in a&lt;br /&gt;prompt manner. Good directions already using it.</li>
    <li> Really works! My teeth were whiter immediately after the first treatment.</li>
    <li> There is a difference but not as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Still giving it a chance, as I only use it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Works after a couple of tries but overall satisfaction guaranteed ! Arrived super fast, you can see a difference the first try but need to keep up on it at least 10 mins a day. Remember if you drink coffee like me always brush your teeth right after!</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit because it included the acceleration light, 5 tubes of whitening gel and it was at a great price point around $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:The kit does work and your teeth will be a little bit whiter, even after just one use!&lt;br /&gt;Con: The time involved. Each time you whiten, you&#x27;re supposed to leave the gel on and have the light on the gel for approximately 30 minutes. 30 minutes is just too much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I prefer the whitening gel pens that you can brush on while getting ready and they whiten in just a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best whitening kit ever! I used it once it came in (which was about 4 days after i ordered it) and in that one use my teeth lightened 3-4 shades. I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now, everyday and my teeth are super white. I mess up the tray that came with it because they shrunk when i was trying to mold them into my teeth, i really wish that i could just order the trays again. Other then that i highly recommend this, you can&#x27;t go wrong especially with this price tag!</li>
    <li> Product burned my gums and did not whiten my teeth.  Do not purchase this item</li>
    <li> I received the package today, used it for 30 mins with the light and my teeth are 4 shades brighter. this product is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but the light is not bright at all. Two twenty five minute treatments and I have seen no results.</li>
    <li> works wonderful and fast.</li>
    <li> The best. 2nd whitening. Teeth are white.</li>
    <li> Trays couldn&#x27;t mold well to teeth.  When dipped in boiling water tray also deformed too fast.  Thankfully this didn&#x27;t cost too much.&lt;br /&gt;Went with the Crest whitening strips which are much easier to use and had great results within a week.</li>
    <li> Could tell te difference after the first use... just make sure you read and follow the instructions or else you are going to have a bad time (according to others ppls reviews).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant beat this package for the price, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but I bought it and I love it!!!!! It really works!!!!!!! Love my brite whites 😄😄😄😄</li>
    <li> No direction on how to prevent gum damage ate my gums up after 3 treatments.</li>
    <li> It whitens as advertised.  The trays are awful, though, to the point of being damaging.  Very difficult to get to fit tightly, then to trim effectively.  Could have used another set - or at least one tray - for practice.  Burned the ever loving mess out of my gums the first try with the peroxide, so tried to trim them more so that they stopped below the gum line - which caused the top one to tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ditched the trays (for bleaching, kept for remineralization) and did what others are successfully doing.  Got a Dental Lip and Cheek Retractor.  I paint on the peroxide with a q-tip then lay down for 20 or so minutes.  I was drooling pretty bad one time so I used a tea towel to occasionally absorb what I could.  But this lets you get the peroxide where it needs to be, and keeps it off your gums.  Ouch!  Like, serious two-day ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I recommend the remineralization gel - had no teeth sensitivity after using it.  Those strips and other over-the-counter kits left me in pain for a few days so I know I&#x27;m sensitive.  The gel, from what I can tell, worked wonders.</li>
    <li> easy to use. great results</li>
    <li> I used this as directed, I am in my early 50&#x27;s with relatively healthy teeth.  Within 6 weeks the enamel had eroded from my outer corners all around my teeth.  I do not recommend this product and if you do use it, do not keep it on as long as they say!</li>
    <li> This is a great way to whiten teeth I have paid $100 before to get a kit at a tanning salon and had to go there and re do and use their light.  Then I paid $25 for a refill. Now the place is closed and no light available.  This whole kit is great and several shades lighter teeth are worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this kit. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I was able to see the difference from the first time I used it. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am Dental Assistant. I work at a private cosmetic facility. I wanted to whiten but i had to pay. I ordered this because is the exact same product we use in the office and charge 600.00 for take home. It works amazing.. my teeth are a the whitest they ever been. Now the owner wants to use me to sell his product.. business right.....&lt;br /&gt;HINT HINT Hints of the TRADE. DO NOT OVERFILL the trays... use a Q-tip or a mini brush and brush the whitening Gel on the teeth directly then put on the trays. You will get the same benefits and a lot LESS pain. ALSO DO NOT USE REGULAR TOOTHPASTE while whitening.. use Sensodine or any tooth paste for sensitive teeth and a fluoride rich mouthwash after the complete treatment or until you reached the white you wanted. This will help out a lot.</li>
    <li> In two treatments I got great results without sensitivity. The first time I used it I fallowed directions, after trimming the trays, I did not like the way it fit and was very uncomfortable. After thinking about it a bit I figure I would play around with it to see if I can improve the way I used it for even better results. I trashed the trays and used a small pai brush to paint the gel on my teeth instead then used the light for 30 minutes instead and it worked even better! I rolled up some tissues and put them in between my lips and gums to protect them from the gel. It stings if you get it on your gums. If you put some tissues in between your gums and lips then use a paint brush paint the gel on the teeth then 30 minutes of light and you got it! Brilliant teeth!! Good luck! :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use the product because it was very unprofessional! Looks like something being packed in an apartment by wanna be con artists.</li>
    <li> Like others said, if it gets on your gums, it burns. It&#x27;s really a pain .... time consuming. Instead of the strips where you put them on and then go about your business, with this stuff, you have to sit still and use the light and drool like mad :) or maybe that was just me.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this stuff to work but I&#x27;m on my sixth time using it and almost no change in the color of my teeth. I&#x27;m really tired of having this disgusting stuff in my mouth and it shows no effect.</li>
    <li> Works well, I dislike the trays (any trays for that matter, so I brush on teeth using a q-tip then use the light. noticed a difference the first time I used .</li>
    <li> I had a problem with my first laser and it was quickly replaced with no problem. . I am happy with my purchase and it works great</li>
    <li> I am using he product using the custom made mold that I got from my dentist.  I ordered the product because it was a better price than what I can get from my dentist and the light was also good.</li>
    <li> My teeth were ghost white within a week ! The easiest, most impressive product I&#x27;ve received for a couple bucks:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****TIP ****&lt;br /&gt;MY FIRST USE : the directions say to fill the mouth piece with the gel first, but when I did, it turned my gums white for 30 minutes and had them peeling for 2 days! **I put way to much** .. Look at yourself in the mirror and put the gel directly onto your teeth, not a lot but just enough to cover the front row of your teeth each separately DO NOT CLOSE OR MOVE MOUTH IN THE PROCESS.. lol. i&#x27;ve learned from experience! then immediately put in mouth guards and follow the rest of the directions :)</li>
    <li> The whole package at a great price, and works quickly</li>
    <li> i bought this product because i have tried all kinds of whitening, it was cheap and the % was hight so i gave it a whirl--i used my own trays&lt;br /&gt;the light makes no difference, i brush it on with a small tipped brush which works great, then sit back for 2 hours and wait--i dont have any&lt;br /&gt;sensitivty on my teeth or gums i have seen a difference in 2 weeks although i have not been consistent every day !! and have noticed the&lt;br /&gt;difference in colour because i have crowns on the eye teeth and can see the difference, people at work have noticed the difference too&lt;br /&gt;of lipstick does make your teeth seem whiter, i am pleased with this product and would buy again</li>
    <li> It works great, but when it came in, there were NO instructions. There were only the trays, the light and the syringes. I had to look it up and print out the instructions. Also, there is no chart to measure whiteness.</li>
    <li> Next best thing to a professional kit.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Shipping was superrr fasttt!! Excellent product. I saw the difference with the first use. Will continue to use for better results. Highly recommend! The best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> After my first use, I noticed a great difference!</li>
    <li> My husband wanted to use it before our wedding...Horrifying..gums got numb and turned white, felt like it was burning horribly, seems like a product that should only be used by a professional</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve bought a lot of items on Amazon but I never review. Given the importance and potential danger of this particular product I decided to write one. I have been using this for 3 days. 2 times a day for 30 mins a time. This isn&#x27;t a one size fits all product but this is how I been doing it to great results. Amazing results actually. I was nervous and skeptical. The following is my instructions and experience:  Step one, brush your teeth and floss.  Step two, dry your teeth. I use a cloth then make sure to not close my mouth so they stay dry.  Step three, application: DO NOT PUT THIS STUFF DIRECTLY IN THE TRAY. SERIOUSLY. DON&#x27;T. You won&#x27;t get anything from it other then extreme pain and waste. (Thankfully I knew this already though.) Gums don&#x27;t grow back and if you&#x27;ve ever seen anyone &amp;#34;long in the tooth&amp;#34; that&#x27;s what you could become if you&#x27;re not careful. What you do is take little teenie tiny droplets (a tiny bit goes a long way) from the syringe and paint your teeth with a Q-tip or paintbrush being very careful to not touch any of the gums. Get close to the mirror , concentrate and take your time doing this. Keep your mouth open and teeth exposed during this. I am not doing both rows at a time. My bottom row is more sensitive then top and really don&#x27;t see the bottom teeth when smiling anyways. Also it&#x27;s much easier to do a row at a time.  Step 4, put on guard. Do it for a little bit first time to gauge how sensitive you are. Like 5 mins. Then take it off and wait a hour or so. If feeling okay then redo and go for 15. If feeling fine after that redo and go for 30. I personally wouldn&#x27;t advise doing more then 2 30 min sessions a day. This stuff is super duper strong and dangerous. Honestly I&#x27;m very surprised that it&#x27;s even legal to buy over the counter.  Step 5, SET A TIMER. (use your phone or something but for real use a timer.)  Step 6, Stick the light thing in your mouth. It prolly doesn&#x27;t do anything because real dentist lights are costly and hit a higher range of spectrum but use it anyways just to look silly if you have it. It&#x27;s part of the experience lol.  *Don&#x27;t swallow. If your spit builds up too bad in your mouth go spit and then put the light thingy back in. (This type of peroxide is loosely linked to cancer so best to not eat it if possible.)  When time goes off remove tray and gargle with some water. Keep a glass by the sink to be prepared. Then brush lightly (teeth and gums will prolly be a little sensitive so don&#x27;t push the brush too hard) with a good toothpase that promotes enamel health. (I use Crest pro enamel. Seems to rejuvenate using it before and after the bleaching sessions.  I must of increased 8 shades in 3 days multiple applications per day so it totally works great but do be careful. Plan on doing it for another couple days Know your limits here and patience is virtue. I&#x27;ve only used half of one tube so far. Way more product then you will ever need so maybe get extra guards and share with friends and family.  Your teeth are weaker during this time. They can also regress quickly during this time. What I&#x27;ve been doing is using the guard on top row when I smoke to keep it off them. Also trying to avoid coffee/tea but drinking coffee/tea with a straw and the guard in for each sip. (total coffee and tea addict here) 7 days after your last bleaching session you can go back to normal routine. Just brush a bunch while waiting those 7 days and use some fluoride mouthwash too. Maybe that blue remineralization gel. Whatever just hit them buggers with a ton of nutrients so they get their strength back and don&#x27;t regress.   If you follow these directions you will have results. They may not be the most dramatic and trust me you&#x27;re never going to look like TV people and magazines cause thats nothing but a parade of veneers and photoshop but you will lighten up considerably. Just be patient and good luck!~ ^^</li>
