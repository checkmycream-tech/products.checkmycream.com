      <li>However 10 minutes after I washed my face it began to burn and turned bright red.</li>
      <li>I plan to ask for a full refund.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle (</li>
      <li>back to the review, I love this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I tried it the first day and felt it tingling.  </li>
      <li>and my acne has pretty much disappeared without drying my skin at all!</li>
      <li>In the morning i use a little bit of aveeno&#x27;s spf moisturizer and if i shower at night there is really no need at all to use a moiturizer after using this as it leaves your skin feeling great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the 2 pack for a very long time more than a year.  </li>
      <li>Gentle on skin.</li>
      <li>I gently massage this cleanser on my lids and on my eyelashes (without rubbing it into the eyes).  </li>
      <li>: have to really work for a lather if you don&#x27;t use a cloth or sponge.</li>
      <li>and this face wash cleans my face very well</li>
      <li>this is a neat, gentle wash.</li>
      <li>I use this facewash everyday and it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean when I come out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice, subtle scent and a clean feel that leaves the skin silky soft.</li>
      <li>The entire line of products still exists in drugstores with the exception of this most basic one.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I think i will switch back to the clean and clear morning burst cleanser.</li>
      <li>trying something new always is a risk.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive so</li>
      <li>I know it works because the next day, after I take a hot shower, I don&#x27;t have the telltale raccoon eyes of residual mascara.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say I was thrilled when I saw that they had a facial cleaner, especially sense it is all natural and safe for use while breastfeeding.</li>
      <li>I decided to give Aveeno Smart Essentials Pore Purifying Facial Wash a try after reading lots of reviews and researching it elsewhere online.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to try to clear up some itchy spots on my face.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I try to take care of my face.  </li>
      <li>(I think I&#x27;m at an age where anti-acne stuff actually gives me acne - confusing I know, but also kind of a relief to know I&#x27;m not a teenager anymore.)  </li>
      <li>other days, it thinks it&#x27;s full blown oily and then, there are those days when it erupts with major eczematous patches with a sprinkling of pimples.</li>
      <li>The price also cant be beat, compared to many of the other more expensive cleansers on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used all of the typical drug store cleansers from clean and clear all the way to simple skin care.</li>
      <li>I bought Aveeno Smart Essentials Pore Purifying Facial Wash after my facial wash was discontinued, it was the third I tried and the one I now stick with.</li>
      <li>I also pair it with Aveeno face lotion and always find my skin to be radiant and never dry or oily.  </li>
      <li>It washes off all residues and sweat on my skin, and leaves me shine free for at least 5 hours, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
      <li>Only need a little bit to do the trick, but each tub will last about 1-2 months depending how much you use it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It smells so good with some sort of fruit aroma. Also, it helps clean the oil on the face after a whole day work! I felt cleaness and softness of my skin after using it. My sensitive skin did not show any negative reaction to it. It is so price worthy to by it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveeno lotions on my skin as well as my children&#x27;s for years. Their lotions are the only ones that relieved my daughter&#x27;s eczema when she was a baby and I also have sensitive skin and most use caution with skin care products. Needless to say I was thrilled when I saw that they had a facial cleaner, especially sense it is all natural and safe for use while breastfeeding. The scent is amazing and it does not dry out my skin like most facial cleaners do. It is a fabulous product and I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno products.  They are never oily/greasy or over-powering with smells and get the job done.  I use this facewash everyday and it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean when I come out of the shower.  I also pair it with Aveeno face lotion and always find my skin to be radiant and never dry or oily.  This is a smooth face wash with a very light scent.  Nice and calming on the face.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful face wash.  It removes all my makeup with only 2 small squirts, even eyeliner and regular mascara.  I feel like it leaves my skin very clean and has a mild pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> This was a great find!  I purchased it because it was cheap (about 7 bucks) and it was made by Aveeno.  My skin suffers from multiple personalities... sometimes it think it&#x27;s combination, other days, it thinks it&#x27;s full blown oily and then, there are those days when it erupts with major eczematous patches with a sprinkling of pimples. As a result, my skin likes to react to the same product in different ways depending on its mood.  But somehow, Aveeno products have provided some stability to my skin&#x27;s psyche.    Soooo... back to the review, I love this cleanser.  It&#x27;s very gentle (no abrasive beads, no harsh soaps to strip away moisture) but is still very effective in cleaning off all of my makeup, including my waterproof mascara!  Typically, I use the Lancome Bifacil eye makeup remover but sometimes, that feels too harsh so instead,  I gently massage this cleanser on my lids and on my eyelashes (without rubbing it into the eyes).  I know it works because the next day, after I take a hot shower, I don&#x27;t have the telltale raccoon eyes of residual mascara.  Another plus, it&#x27;s got a great fragrance... not too strong but pleasant enough to make your cleansing routine that much more enjoyable.    What can I say, I heart Aveeno and they have another winner with this product.</li>
    <li> This product smells good and lathered nice. However 10 minutes after I washed my face it began to burn and turned bright red. The day after my cheeks were still irritated and really dry. I am shocked that a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; Aveeno product would bother me so much. I plan to ask for a full refund.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best facial wash on the market. I&#x27;ve used most every other facial wash for the past ten years and none have cleared up my pimples and zits like Aveeno Active Naturals Facial Wash-Southernwood. I&#x27;ve been using it for just a little over a year and managed to stock up on quite a few once I saw that stores were no longer selling it. I&#x27;m hoping Aveeno isn&#x27;t discontinuing this product because in all honesty it is the best on the market. It gives my face a natural glow, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy, and it smells wonderful. You will not be disappointed. Perfect for persons with sensitive skin and rarely wear make up.</li>
    <li> I bought this face wash from walmart and i found that since im using it the tone of my face looks better and also looks brighter. I have super oily skin and this face wash cleans my face very well but without overdrying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> A nice cleanser for your skin.  It smells nice and is relatively gentle on my skin.  I&#x27;ve had the 2 pack for a very long time more than a year.  One pump goes a very long way!</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to clear up some itchy spots on my face.  I found San Francisco Soap&#x27;s Olive Oil Bath Bar to work better.  Don&#x27;t know why it works better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! I have used all of the typical drug store cleansers from clean and clear all the way to simple skin care. I found this stuff in my moms closet one time and decided to snag it and use it in the shower. After the first use i could tell i loved it. Have used it for over 6 months now and my acne has pretty much disappeared without drying my skin at all! I have combination skin and this is perfect for me. In the morning i use a little bit of aveeno&#x27;s spf moisturizer and if i shower at night there is really no need at all to use a moiturizer after using this as it leaves your skin feeling great! PLEASE TRY THIS PRODUCT JUST ONE TIME!</li>
    <li> I bought Aveeno Smart Essentials Pore Purifying Facial Wash after my facial wash was discontinued, it was the third I tried and the one I now stick with. I have oily, acne prone skin, which sometimes gets dry. The definition of combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons: Wanted a day/night facial wash to combat shine but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too.I was looking for a cleaner that can clarify pores as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;used in summer, which is OILY skin. It washes off all residues and sweat on my skin, and leaves me shine free for at least 5 hours, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.&lt;br /&gt;used in cold months, when my skin is DRY. It still washes off the impurities, but also seems to keep the ph of my skin, as it doesn&#x27;t get dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: have to really work for a lather if you don&#x27;t use a cloth or sponge.</li>
    <li> I love it. Gentle on skin. I have been using it for 3 months now and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a skin.</li>
    <li> My most favourite product ever. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years now, its helped resolve my acne. I am so sad to say that Aveeno has discontinued this product :( so get it while you can!! I emailed them my disappointment, and they said sorry, try another one of our products. They didn&#x27;t give a reason why. :(</li>
    <li> This face wash smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh and smooth. I&#x27;m really picky about smells and don&#x27;t like washes that leave my skin feeling tight and dry.  This one is great!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I have to be careful about what types of cleansers I use.  I decided to give Aveeno Smart Essentials Pore Purifying Facial Wash a try after reading lots of reviews and researching it elsewhere online.  I was not disappointed.  Not only is it gentle on my skin, but it also effectively removes my makeup (even my waterproof mascara).  The scent is bright and pleasant, but in no way girly.  Even my husband, who NEVER uses face wash, has started using this every day!!</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED with this face wash and, of course, I can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore. For years I&#x27;ve been looking for a good wash that doesn&#x27;t leave my super dry, sensitive skin peeling off and breaking out, and I finally found this amazing one. It has a nice, subtle scent and a clean feel that leaves the skin silky soft. The entire line of products still exists in drugstores with the exception of this most basic one. It makes me incensed. AVEENO, PLEASE BRING THIS PRODUCT BACK!!!</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive so trying something new always is a risk. I had no problems with the switch and my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> I tried this because my skin was looking dull and my pores were getting inflamed.  I am in my late 20s and have had acne in the past, but right now I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.  I have big pores and they were looking a little inflamed and... well kind of gross.  I tried it the first day and felt it tingling.  Then, I noticed that my pores were significantly less inflamed.  Over the course of the first week I noticed that my pores decreased in size by around 1/2 and my skin was happy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I try to take care of my face.  I like this facial wash because it is gentle and smells great.  It&#x27;s a great value for your money and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Best product so far. Love everything aveeno and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Have been using it for years now and I could tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and it works just as good as regular soap. It would be so much better with scrubbing beads. It smells good but doesn&#x27;t really help with the acne. Might be an okay cleanser for a user that doesn&#x27;t have any issues with oily skin, but this is not the stuff for me. I think i will switch back to the clean and clear morning burst cleanser.</li>
    <li> this is a neat, gentle wash. works well in combination with other products. i don&#x27;t think by itself is enough to get what you want...</li>
    <li> A nice smell, nice non-greasy finish, the Smart Essentials line is the only face care product line I trust to keep my face clean and not cause breakouts.  (I think I&#x27;m at an age where anti-acne stuff actually gives me acne - confusing I know, but also kind of a relief to know I&#x27;m not a teenager anymore.)  I also like the small quantity the pump allows - it guarantees that I&#x27;m not using an excessive amount of soap, making the face wash actually an economical purchase since I use less soap per wash.  Also, my girlfriend likes it, helping remove her clutter on my bathroom counter from her own products and keeping her a happy camper when she visits.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent daily facial cleaner. It leaves you feeling light and bright each morning. Its a great option for those looking for an oil-free and soap-free wash. The price also cant be beat, compared to many of the other more expensive cleansers on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, as a guy, it has a slightly flowered scent. Others described it as something fresh. My wife also uses it and prefers the scent. The smell does go away after a half-hour or so which makes the wash well worth it.</li>
    <li> Only need a little bit to do the trick, but each tub will last about 1-2 months depending how much you use it.  I use it once every day and it lasts about 2 months.</li>
