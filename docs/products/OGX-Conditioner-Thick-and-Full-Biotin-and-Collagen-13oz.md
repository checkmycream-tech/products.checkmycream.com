<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great conditioner at a great price!</li>
    <li> This works pretty well - could do a better job detangling but is fine. Don&#x27;t see major differences in hair texture. I use it with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m really confused here. I really don&#x27;t know if this is working on my hair or causing tremendous breakage. I have naturally wavy hair, rebonded a few times and colored regularly owing to the grey. Cutting the drama, I thought I was doing fine to maintain the laborious routine of washing, conditioning, blow-drying, then straightening (HSI...love it), and touching up every two months with color. I was using the keratin ogx range which was fine but the past month has been tough. I guess these sulfate free formula have not been washing the products enough so its caused dandruff and flaking - when I &#x27;ve never had dandruff in my life. And just then I changed to OGX Biotin conditioner, my hair that managed to stay up, started falling out like crazy. My hair is softer...but instead of feeling fuller (my hair is really bouncy and thick!), it has just started feeling way thinner and without bounce. Now am really confused and will need to try another conditioner to see if its the heat, dandruff or this conditioner causing the breakage. Will share the experience soon. And oh, awaiting my online order of Paul Mitchell clarifying shampoo for removing product from hair. Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> This smells like cotton candy. I dont think it made my hair thicker or fuller, but it smells good.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. My hair is much healthier now that I am using this.</li>
    <li> It works nicely and I like the scent.</li>
    <li> This product is really great and does exactly what it says. However I did not get it on amazon because it&#x27;s more expensive $7.99 when you can get it the same price as the shampoo $5.74 on other sites. I definitely recommend it otherwise but save yourself $2.25</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever given anything a one-star review but I would give this no stars if I could. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or what but this smells like an old ashtray. Nobody in my household smokes so it&#x27;s not coming from anywhere except this product. The shampoo smells okay (not my favorite scent ever) but something about this conditioner smells like stale, week old cigarettes and I will never, ever use it again.  I can&#x27;t stand it! I switched to the pink bottle and that smells fine.</li>
    <li> love it, great quality, great smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great which was a nice pleasant surprise but it actually makes my hair feel thicker and healthier I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> Another great product for hair recovery. If your hair is thining this product sure does the trick. Highly recommend this conditioner</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner.  It makes  my hair shine but it is easy to keep the volume in my hair and not weight it down.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it makes my hair look thicker and fuller.  After blow drying or air dry my hair is fuller!</li>
    <li> Does make hair feel thicker</li>
    <li> With thin, fine, soft hair that tends to frizz, I was looking for a restorative conditioner and now I found it. Not cheap, but really makes the hair feel wonderful and actually behave for the first time in 66 years!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the Argan Oil product, so I believe would deliver good results as well. I noticed good results from the first use and believe that the long term result will be just as good</li>
    <li> My hair looks thicker. Like it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase... This conditioner works fine for me.... It seems to thicken my hair some, but it is not Rogaine.. I will buy this product again from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I like pretty much all of the Organix products but this one may have just became my favorite. it smells great! it makes my hair super soft : )</li>
    <li> My long hair just keeps feeling better and better since I began using OGX shampoo and conditioner in October 2014.  It looks healthier also.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Today was the first time I used this Shampoo and conditioner since they came in today :-) Smells good, hope I get long long long hair soon :-)</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! Great scent and it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean. The only issue I have is that I overpaid - only a day after I got it I found it for almost half the price I paid on here. Look around and enjoy.</li>
    <li> It made me feel like there was something in my hair, and it took days of using another shampoo/conditioner to get that residue out. I really feel like it messed up my hair.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I feel like this makes my hair feel straw like, but others it feels great. I usually wash my hair every other day and it seems to make my hair feel healthy and a little thicker. I have fine, thin hair and I do notice a different. However, I wish it moisturized my ends better</li>
    <li> I was having oily hair issues for quite some time. However, when I started using this conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo every other wash and a shampoo brush, my hair is lovely and never feels stripped or weighed down.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, fine, somewhat-thin hair, so of course I&#x27;m always looking for that Miracle Hair product that can defy my ancestral genes. This comes pretty close. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple week&#x27;s and&lt;br /&gt;it definitely makes my hair FEEL thicker and seems to be taming the frizz to a certain degree. My husband has been giving me compliments on my hair  The only downside is the price for such a small bottle. I&#x27;ll purchase on Amazon if I&#x27;m going to run out and need it quicker, but it&#x27;s three dollars cheaper in town per bottle.</li>
    <li> Looks good , waiting for effects</li>
    <li> Smells great, and makes my hair LOOK thicker, but also makes it look frizzy....</li>
    <li> This stuff is powerful and thick! VERY THICK! Worth every penny I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about the OGX Thick &amp; Full Biotin &amp; Collagen products.&lt;br /&gt;Number one -- they work. Use the shampoo, conditioner and amplifying lotion together. They&#x27;re very concentrated and they last. A little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;Number two -- this is silky and thick. You don&#x27;t need a lot to achieve soft,silky, thicker hair. You may find that at some point you don&#x27;t even need to use this daily. I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for 3 months and now use it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Number three -- If you have baby fine or thinning hair, especially thinning hair, this helps so much. I had thinning areas/small bald spots forming due to age and surgery. This product was recommended by my nutritionist along with a daily biotin supplement. Over the past three months not only have the thinning spots stopped thinning, the bald spots have filled in and my once baby fine hair has thickened. Even my hair stylist commented on it and asked me what I was using.</li>
    <li> I love both the shampoo and this condidtioner, my hair is white and tends to by dry and this condiditoner really helps with that</li>
    <li> I like it. It soften my hair like the rest of the ogx shampoos and conditioners. I like the smell I like the color and it really does help your thicker. My hair seemed 2x thick anlfter using this one time. I used other conditioners a few days after and it was still thick. Recommended</li>
    <li> I just start using it , hope to see good result soon. Because I notice my hair is thinning and I was told to use this hair produce for my hair and so far so good.</li>
    <li> I like it, it makes my hair smell good, and soft and it nourishes my scalp</li>
    <li> It could be a coincidence, or a combination of other products, but I authentically find a few more stubbles growing every time I look in the mirror. Sure, I don&#x27;t have a corn field growing, but I feel like an elementary school student growing lima beans.</li>
    <li> Love it love it. Growing older has thinned and dried my hair. Not to mention I feel bald compared to my younger years. This leaves my hair silky and shiny.  This is fantastic and it smells great. Not mediciny at all.</li>
    <li> amazing product! Love the smell and how smooth my hair is after using this. Not heavy, waxy, oily, or stripping. This works great for my coarse fine hair whether i want to blow dry, air dry, curl or brush strait. I like the results of this better than any of their keratin lines for strait hair days. clean and well packaged. Sender was prompt. no issues during transaction. I will gladly purchase from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> its a good product fto stop lost hair but unfurtunally for me did not work ,i wanna my hair smooth</li>
    <li> promotes hair growth and smells great! Have been using it for months now and will continue to buy the product!</li>
    <li> Leaves a film on my hair. Hair did appear noticeably thicker but that change in texture of my hair was not something I could tolerate. It wasn&#x27;t a greasy feeling but my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the process of growing my hair out, and ordered this on a whim. I&#x27;ve been taking biotin orally and thought that the biotin shampoo/conditioner would be a great addition. I love it! It&#x27;s very thick and moisturizing and smells awesome! I love that it&#x27;s also sulfate and paraben free! Such a wonderful addition to my long hair treatment collection!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the entire OGX line and this was no exception! My hair had some damage and felt weak and this seemed to solve the problem. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker and healthier looking after every use now.  I use this about twice a week along with the shampoo.  Prior to using this my hair looked thin, lifeless, and unhealthy.  I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> After living my whole life as a natural. I was long overdue for a change, and with my mother&#x27;s permission, finally relaxed my hair. Definitely not as full when I relaxed it, compared to the lion&#x27;s mane I had before. There were times that I loved it (for example, when my stylist relaxed my hair with Silk Elements). But hair started to change rapidly (dryness, breakage, split ends like you wouldn&#x27;t believe, etc.) I went to a wig later on. Whereas sew-ins, etc, grew my natural hair like crazy, I learned the hard way that these protective styles can be damaging if not cared for, and perhaps left in for too long. I experienced a lot breakage, and my hair was getting thin. Okay, here&#x27;s the point of the story lol, I was in search for products that would volumize my hair (which I never felt I had to do) and I found this Organix Conditioner last year, simultaneously when I learned and started to texlax my hair. My hair is definitely thicker now and I am pleased. (Now just for the length to come back with the thickness.) I avoided the shampoo, because after I relaxed my hair, I also learned sulfate shampoo made my hair come out in clumps when I&#x27;d wash it in the shower and it literally stripped the life out my hair. I love this conditioner and hope to continue to use for the rest of my life lol. It has slip which is important for me in a conditioner, it conditioners and I love the way it feels on my hair. I literally just used this on my ends yesterday (as the thinnest part of my hair) and I loved they way it felt. I could feel it literally plump up my skinny strands (as the bottle says lol). I realize I&#x27;ve written a book lol, but I do hope this review is helpful for someone!</li>
    <li> Like I said in my shampoo review, I love the OGX brand of shampoos and conditioners. I have baby fine straight hair and this shampoo/conditioner combo gives my hair body without drying it out. I am not sure how it would work on dry hair. Lathers great and smells absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> I have very chin length, fine, thin, blonde hair. After having two children, I noticed that it got the greasy weighted-down look much more easily by the end of the day. No matter what shampoo or conditioner I tried, I had this problem- and absolutely NO volume. I even used all the &amp;#34;volumizing, clarifying, light moisturizing&amp;#34; products you could find. I tried sprays, mousses, volumizing creams. You name it! Then I came accross this. HOLY MOLY! It works. My hair still feels clean and light. No more weighted down feeling. No greasiness. Try it. It is worth the money. I used the shampoo and conditioner. I do replace the shampoo with a clear clarifying shampoo 2-3 days a week just to clean out any residue from my scalp and hair. Just try it. I know it may not work for everyone, but I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> It does work for sure. This price is more $$ than Target tho. It&#x27;s like $5 at Target so I&#x27;ll just get it there going forward.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18 and have been suffering from hair loss for the past two years. I have very baby fine hair with thin spots all over my head.... this product when left on for several minutes really does help plumpen up my strands and makes my hair feel softer and shinier.... its no miracle product, but out of all the conditioners ive used this is so far my favorite... i only wash my hair about twice a week which also helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a month ago at Wal-Mart along with the conditioner all for $10- $12. I love it with me being natural it makes my hair look so much thicker. I will definitely continue to use this line of products for awhile.</li>
    <li> I got ripped off bed bath and beyond sells a bigger one of these for much cheaper. Serves me right for not comparing prices.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for anyone. Personally, my hair has been thinning a tiny bit lately (I&#x27;m 23) and it&#x27;s always kind of been try and unmanageable. Since getting this shampoo however, my hair looks thicker, feels thicker, it has a great shine (not greasy, just shiny and healthy looking, and it&#x27;s super soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally feel like most conditioners with added ingredients are just gimmicks and an excuse to charge extra. This conditioner is different though, it&#x27;s the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2-3 times a week, and leave it in for about 5 minutes before rinsing it out. If you aren&#x27;t happy with your current hair or conditioner, give this a try - it&#x27;s by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used before, and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - at the time of the review (Jul 12) I have not run out of this, and I bought it almost 3 months ago on April 21th. It&#x27;s not super cheap, but it&#x27;s not expensive; it&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
    <li> I already have thick hair, but this plumps it up even more. Also send to help manage frizz and increase shine. My hair looks and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell (overly perfumey) and it leaves my hair a bit tangled. I&#x27;ll use what I have, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this at all. Seemed to dry my hair out way to much, doesn&#x27;t smell that great either. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It made my hair stiff rather than the thicker feel I was looking for. It also made my hair feel dry.</li>
    <li> Works well. Pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s something to do with the way this is supposed to make your hair thick and full, (so it adds some stuff to your hair?) but I didn&#x27;t like the way it leaves hair feeling!  I bought it for my daughters who have thin hair, but they&#x27;re also rowdy and constantly have really tangly hair.  Normally after I wash and condition their hair it&#x27;s nice and smooth and silky and easy to comb through, but this was terrible to brush after the bath!  Their hair still felt totally tangly and not at all soft and smooth.  They would cry so much about it hurting while I brushed their hair that I finally just quit using this.  It may have made their hair a little thicker... hard to tell after only 4 or 5 uses... Maybe this is just how all thickening shampoo and conditioner is?  Now I&#x27;m afraid to buy any more to try another brand!</li>
    <li> makes my hair very soft and straight!</li>
    <li> I feel like it makes hair thicker by leaving a bunch of build up.  I used the shampoo and conditioner together.</li>
    <li> Great, would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> My hair is still falling out but I love the way it smells and how it makes my hair feel. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually doing anything for me but it&#x27;s a lot better than some of the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m going to try something else to see if my hair stops dropping but I will finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> this brand is amazing! after about 2 uses, I noticed a significant difference. My hair felt fuller and thicker which I hadn&#x27;t had since in awile and I was afraid that this shampoo/conditioner would take some time to kick in. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> My hair is combination hair, curly, wavy, straight and VERY frizzy. My roots are very oily but my ends are very dry because I have long hair. I used this in combination with the coconut milk shampoo. LOVED IT. Smells amazing. The biotin and collagen condition works wonders. I&#x27;m not kidding, my hair is very tangled and just gross sometimes. I can never come through when using conditioner. I rinsed the conditioner out after 1 minute and my hair was so smooth and just felt amazing. I could run my fingers through my hair while rinsing the conditioner out. I woke up the next morning and WOW. The difference in my hair was amazing. My hair feels so full and voluminous. My roots aren&#x27;t greasy one bit while my ends still feel moisturized! Definitely a score! Very shiny and smooth too! Also, while I&#x27;m in the bath my hair usually comes out a lot. With this I had nothing come out... Amazing. I&#x27;m going to say I didn&#x27;t buy this from amazon. I bought this from Ulta. They had it on sale for 5.99 for the bottle, then I found a bottle where you get 50% more free!! So I got two big ones that were 19.5 fl ounce for $9.18 since I used the $3.50 off of $10. Definitely a score and I cannot wait to keep using this. Definitely give it a try. Great combo with the coconut milk shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. I recommend it after shampooing with Nexxus Vita Biotin shampoo. You will have a healthier, shinny, stronger hair.</li>
    <li> Like the smell and texture it gives to my hair.</li>
    <li> OGX is the best hair products I have ever used. The conditioner leaves my hair light and natural with no split ends. The Keritan works wonderfully on my granddaughters thick, long hair. No knots, comb glides through.</li>
    <li> This product is made of lot of vitamins, minerals which make your hair stronger and shiny. I have been using this shampoo for 1 month and noticed the result  i will be back to order it again and again</li>
    <li> This product smells so good, but I will not buy again. It dried my hair out so bad! I think I even lost hair in the back from it.</li>
    <li> I have long light brown hair (well, it&#x27;s probably a lot grey but I haven&#x27;t seen the real color for ages). My hair is almost to my waist, and the weight of it precludes much volume at the crown. I think this shampoo and conditioner actually does make seem thicker and fuller. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper at amazon than my local drug store, and with amazon prime free shipping, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells, its not strong, which works for me. I use the shampoo, conditioner, and hairspray. Gives me that &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in hair composition. I suffer from post partum hairloss and this didn&#x27;t help at all:-/ also made hair more oily. I used shampoo and conditioner together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and I&#x27;m not impressed at all.  It left my hair frizzy looking.  Although they say Pantene is bad for your hair it works much better than this.</li>
    <li> Smells great but takes a while to rinse out. No faster-than-normal hair growth noted. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> This product..returned my hair back to the fullness I had before menopause...no kidding.  Stocking up big time..need shampoo and the conditioner</li>
    <li> As a soldier, my hair spends 95% of its life wrapped tightly in a bun. My hair was horribly damaged and I had to hack a good chunk of it off to get rid of damaged ends. This conditioner in combination with the shampoo has done WONDERS for my hair! And it smells INCREDIBLE! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use the conditioner and shampoo and my hair does feel fuller and looks thicker, but I also do other things to try and keep my hair shiny and full.  These are good products to use for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because this is a great product I like that it was shipped on time an I also like Biotin conditioner I will recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> To start off, I have nearly waist length curly hair, and my hair strands are very fine. Some parts of my hair seem to be normal porosity while other parts seem to have low porosity, and my curl pattern is a combination of 3A and 3B. I bought this at a Shoppers Drug Mart for 6.99, because the biotin aspect of this conditioner enticed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is fantastic. It smells great, and it soaks into my hair almost instantly. I feel that the collagen and biotin are clinging to my hair, and after i rinse it out and my hair is dry, my curls are very fluffy and soft. I have noticed that my hair seems to dry a lot faster when I use this, maybe because my hair is coated in protein. I do advise anyone with hair similar to mine to use this no more than about once a week. It has been a bit drying to my hair. I use this once a week and Aussie Moist the rest of the time. I have also experimented with leaving just a tiny amount in my hair. Instead of fully rinsing my hair, I rinse lightly and make sure that I still have a light coating on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for people with curly hair types.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner.  Really helps with hair loss</li>
    <li> Very good. Smell good. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The delivery left my package three doors away from my address....  I had that at the mercy of a neighbor that I didn&#x27;t even know!  So...:(</li>
    <li> This Conditioner works wonders!  I am so glad I decided to give it a try thanks to a YouTube Vlogger I watch.  It makes my hair feel soft, full and healthy.  A+++</li>
    <li> Does everything it says it does.  My hair looked thicker immediately and feels great.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite. It makes my hair so healthy.</li>
    <li> I love Organix shampoo and conditioners and when this came out I had to try it. I had shampoo at the time but running low on conditioner so I bought it. I have to say that this is a great conditioner. It smells amazing and it&#x27;s not super heavy but it&#x27;s not super light either. My hair does feel thicker and fuller. I already have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s short,mid neck length. I plan on buying the shampoo in a few days and will leave a review on that too. I hope it is as good as the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love the fullness and natural flow after using these products.</li>
    <li> The item rec&#x27;d had been used...pdt missing...scotch tape  sloppily applied on lid to hold in the conditioner.  at least 1/2 of the conditioner was gone.  I ordered NEW NOT USED!!!!!!!  will not buy ever again</li>
    <li> It really creates good texture for my hair according to those ingredients listed and it smells perfume as a bonus touch to my body.</li>
    <li> This condition smells really good I haven&#x27;t got round to using it yet, but the shampoo worked really cool so I know this one will too, also delivery came like 2 days after buying, really great.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner however, I do not feel it is the best I&#x27;ve tried. I need a conditioner that is more moisturizing. I tried it a few times and put it on my shelf until the weather is better. It has been extremely cold this winter where I live, which is of course very drying on the hair, skin, etc. I am going to try the conditioner (and shampoo) again this spring/summer to give it another chance. I do like the fragrance and am hoping with the change in seasons it will work better for me.</li>
    <li> I am 49 years old, my scalp is a bit oily but my hair has been getting dry and wiry lately. I also noticed it is thinning. I was watching Sunday house call on Fox News and Doctor Samady recommended biotin for hair and nails. I ordered the supplement, and thought it would be good to find a shampoo and conditioner with biotin too. I found this and decided to order it. It has really hydrated my hair. My hair is soft and it also looks fuller and bouncy. It does not make my scalp feel oily. I am expecting the combination of this and the supplement will help with thicker fuller hair over time. I am happy so far.</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoo &amp; conditioner combos out there for fine hair. This product made a big difference in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> A lot of products that claim to amplify fine hair just make it sticky, dull or coated. This makes my hair feel &amp; look fuller without he gooey feeling other brands often give me. In have baby fine hair and this makes it feel much thicker &amp; full of shine.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely. Leaves my hair silky.</li>
    <li> Mu husband&#x27;s hair is doing its age-related thinning and this seems to alleviate that. Maybe it&#x27;s just optical, but it looks good!</li>
    <li> Packaging and the other places to buy there are differences.There is no shelf life</li>
    <li> This product lives up to its description as far as conditioning is concerned, but I absolutely hate the way it smells. You know how some women wear way too much sickeningly sweet perfume? That&#x27;s the way this conditioner smells. It&#x27;s also too thick, making it difficult to squeeze out of the container after a couple weeks of use. That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if it could be stored upside down, but with a rounded cap, that isn&#x27;t possible.</li>
    <li> My first purchase and find the product to  live up to the label directions.  Gave my hair needed moisture and body.</li>
    <li> I feel this conditioner makes my rather dry hair just soft enough, without being limp.  It leaves no discernible residue, either.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Definitely  makes my hair healthy  and grow like weed</li>
    <li> absolutely its working well. my hair better than old.</li>
    <li> From the very first use my hair has been incredibly soft, and I love the smell. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in thickness, but I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would do something more for my thin, limp, hair but I&#x27;ve been using it for just shy of 3 months now and have noticed no changes. It smells really nice, but I plan to change shampoos when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for hair out there..but don&#x27;t buy on Amazon, you can get the exact product and all products from this line for half price..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you don&#x27;t believe me, google it, this is only 5.74 at Walmart,  nearly half of what amazon wants...</li>
    <li> It makes your hair APPER thick and fuller if you use it daily</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner last fall and LOVED it when used together.  I stocked up on the shampoo but not the conditioner.  So when it came time to purchase the conditioner I couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelves anywhere. Not at Ulta, Target, Walgreens, Walmart. So I ordered it on Amazon. Boy was I ever disappointed. Didn&#x27;t work nearly as well. So I thought, i&#x27;ll wait until it&#x27;s back in stores. So I bought some there and the same thing happened. This superior conditioner changed.  It no longer gives my fine, limp hair body and fullness. It made my hair flat and frizzy.  Oh I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this product.  I thought I had FINALLY found a conditioner that works. Please organix, sell your original formula again, not quite sure what you changed in the ingredients, but something is very different as it is not as thick when poured in the palm of my hand! Gave it one star because it does smell awesome!</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel amazing. not sure if its thicker, but it feels great and smells great</li>
    <li> I love this product it was really good, will definetly buy again</li>
    <li> Made my fine, slightly wavy hair feel straw-like and fly-away. Tossing it--and the shampoo, after two tries. Smells like talcum powder, too. Not fresh and appealing.</li>
    <li> Seems to weigh my hair down more than anything... my hair is very fine and I was hoping that perhaps this would give it the boost I need..  Not so..  Smells good though!</li>
    <li> Love it does exactly what it says it does</li>
    <li> This ... Methylchloroisothiazolinone ,is a harmful ingredient,Google it .the Amazon ingredient list doesn&#x27;t show this conditioner has it in,or I wouldnot have purchased.</li>
</ol>
