      <li>I can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great how cheap replacement blades are, and they just pop right on.</li>
      <li>blade is sharp, the comb is perfectly formed, it fits like an OEM part should.</li>
      <li>the Wahl peanut is a great little edger and is also good for buzzer over comb.</li>

      <li>Best little blade for the best little clippers.  </li>

      <li>Fits like a glove on the peanut and works like the original.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m excited to use them since i haven&#x27;t turned them on since the break.</li>
      <li>But the replacement blade teeth are longer than the original head.  </li>
      <li>So when I shave with the Peanut replacement head, it does not shave as close as the original blade</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as original one did.</li>
      <li>I had not realized how worn out my original set of blades were.</li>
      <li>But still great and far superior to any other trimmers I have used over 10 years.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and replacement blade is extremely affordable and works great!</li>
      <li>Cool.</li>
      <li>different color than the picture, black which matches the peanut clipper perfect fit and clip on.</li>
      <li>These little clippers work great for maintaining poodle feet and faces.</li>
      <li>love that i could fix my old clipper blade that is in black&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love my Peanut again the clippers run and look like new again after i dropped the first set and chipped one of the tooth of the blades.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>but when i dropped it the blade/clip broke off and well wasn&#x27;t able to clip back on.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>

      <li>They were very prompt in sending, And I will do business with them again!</li>
      <li>I use it to Flat Top with.  </li>
      <li>When compared to my ~6 year old original blades, I could see that the blades truly do self sharpen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This blade is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected and quick delivery!</li>
      <li>Made my Peanut brand new without having to buy the whole thing</li>
      <li>I ordered this to replace an older blade.</li>
      <li>Product works just fine with Black Wahl Peanut.  </li>
      <li>Like the reviews say not as sharp as the original blade.</li>
      <li>My 3 year old peanut works like new.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The blade already broke.</li>
    <li> The snap-on head for my Peanut was making a rattling sound and coming off while shaving, so I bought a replacement.  The replacement head fits.  I like that I can get black to match my Peanut.  But the replacement blade teeth are longer than the original head.  And the gap is wider.  So when I shave with the Peanut replacement head, it does not shave as close as the original blade teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the replacement package said &amp;#34;standard.&amp;#34;  Maybe there is a &amp;#34;closer/tighter&amp;#34; replacement head.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.</li>
    <li> Best little blade for the best little clippers.  Made in USA.  Cool.</li>
    <li> Only problem with these blades are when you drop it the plastic backing that holds it ontop the clipper that allows it to snap into place break as well. over all great product.</li>
    <li> It cuts hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> Like the reviews say not as sharp as the original blade. But still great and far superior to any other trimmers I have used over 10 years.</li>
