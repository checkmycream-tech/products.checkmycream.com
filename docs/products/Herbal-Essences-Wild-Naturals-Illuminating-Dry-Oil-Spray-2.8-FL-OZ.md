<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This simply isn&#x27;t a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll make your hair feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t add much shine at all.&lt;br /&gt;Plus if you get the spray anywhere near your eyes, watch out.  Leaves a burning sensation.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to try, and was surprised by how well it worked! I spritzed it somewhat generously on freshly washed, dried, and curled hair. It smelled nice (but subtle) and definitely gave my hair a clean, soft shine. The end result was very natural, and it was not at all greasy to the tough - no rub off on anything else, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would use this daily (that could get expensive quickly), but it would be great for an event, a night out, or any time your hair just needs a little pick-me-up.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences have come a long way from the rather industrial shampoo/conditioner that was Herbal Essence (without the final &amp;#34;s&amp;#34;) in the 1970s. Now we have a line of various rejuvenating, detoxifying, or illuminating shampoo/conditioner/oil elixir/dry oil spray series, each of which has its own scent. The oil elixir is a final conditioner, whereas this dry oil spray is a shininess enhancer. A few spritzes of this product and my hair is shinier than it is otherwise after only the shampoo/conditioner. It leaves your hair feeling clean, but not oily, and you won&#x27;t have an oily feeling on your hands after rubbing it in. You can go back and forth - oil elixir one day, dry oil spray the next - if you want the advantages of both products. Nice spray, with a fresh scent that is not overbearing.</li>
    <li> I really like the fragrance which is important to me because I am very sensitive to fake smells.  This is great!  I also flat iron my hair several times a week and the dry oil spray is awesome to help with bringing back the shine.  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> give my hair a nice shine finish . I have very thick course dry hair and it left it amazing . in complimentary of influenster I was able to try the shampoo and conditioner in this brand as well and I love love this product . I will def buy this product now . I recommend this for a great shine finish .</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Dry Oil Spray is a great product. It gives my hair a natural shine without weighing it down. The citric scent is pleasant and refreshing, and fades away quickly after use. The best part about this product is the ability of the spray pump to out a very fine mist of the dry oil. It makes easy to control the right amount of the dry oil on the hair. A couple of pumps would suffice. Any more would render a greasy look instead. Overall, I like this product in that it gives me a quick and easy fix to the otherwise washed-out look on my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this product free with Influenster and have enjoyed using it. I have used Herbal Essences in the past but not recently. I enjoyed the smell and thought it was fresh and natural. I have thick hair but a few sprits of the spray added a nice shine to my hair. I would go and buy this from the store, I love when my hair looks shiny!</li>
    <li> I love this oil spray!  It smells amazing and makes my hair look so healthy.  A little goes a long way so the product is going to last a long time, I love that! WIth other oil sprays my hair had looked greasy, but not with this spray.  I even got a compliment from a stranger the first day I used it!  I was sent this product for free thru Influenster.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for testing purposes from Influenster. I have thick, straight hair, and a ton of it at that. The smell of this product is unbelievably good, although it does not linger long. Its refreshing and sweet but not overpoweringly so. The spray on the product is high quality, meaning you don&#x27;t need to first spray it in your palms to then distribute in my hair. I simply waited for my hair to dry and then sprayed directly into the strands. It left my hair very soft and did not feel oily at all. It also exemplified the natural wave and tamed frizz. This is my favorite product out of the trio. I&#x27;ll likely repurchase once mine runs out.</li>
    <li> I received this product free with the only requirement that I post an honest review. I have to say I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;m not a regular user of Herbal Essences. I mean, I used to use them a lot more but I&#x27;ve since found products I *thought* I liked more. This spray smells like HEAVEN! That is the only way I can describe the scent. It smells soo delicious...even my husband noticed (and that&#x27;s rare). I do have to admit it took me a few tries to really like the product. The first time I used it, I sprayed about 4-5 squirts directly on my hair (ok, maybe a few more than 4-5, but I kind of lost count...). Result: left my hair a greasy oily mess! Second time I used less squirts (I think...since I never really knew exactly how many I used the first time...) and again sprayed directly onto my hair. Result: MUCH less greasy but still a little heavy. Finally, on my third try, I used maybe 2 1/2 squirts BUT sprayed it onto my hand, rubbed my hands together, then applied all over my hair. Result: MAGIC! It gave me the perfect amount of shine without weighing my hair down, and please don&#x27;t get me started again on the smell. Seriously, it is a step above MAGICAL! I have definitely ben turned back onto Herbal Essences products.</li>
    <li> I got the whole set in trial sizes from Influenster complimentary for review. I&#x27;ve used the full set (shampoo, conditioner, and dry oil spray) twice now and I like it a lot. I think it smells great, my hair is very soft, and shiny. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with &amp;#34;the greasy look&amp;#34; i was afraid of, so that&#x27;s wonderful. 4/5 because the price still gets me. It works, but I usually stick to cheaper hair care items.</li>
    <li> I actually tried all of the products out today and it was very good! Made my hair smell excellent and it&#x27;s great to know its natural oils Ã°Å¸ËœÂ</li>
    <li> I really liked how it made my hair shine and also how soft my hair felt when I ran my fingers through it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick coarse hair. I&#x27;ve tried many brands of shampoos and conditioners to make my hair feel not only soft but look healthy as well. I&#x27;ve also tried many serums and sprays. I was skeptical at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would make my hair feel worse like other brands have. To my surprise by my 4th time using Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo, conditions and dry oil spray my hair felt great! My hair is soft, I could run my fingers through my hair and it smells amazing! The dry oil spray doesn&#x27;t make my hair look super oily either which I love. I will definitely be purchasing this in the near future. I was given this product free to test and review. But my review and opinions were completely my own, I will recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample from Influenster, along with the shampoo and conditioner that goes with it. This is my favorite product of the three for sure! It leaves hair super shiny and detangled all day without any oily feel. It also smells really good but is not overpowering. I have tried it on wet and dry hair and didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in effectiveness....either way it was great!</li>
    <li> I like it. Smells great and really shines, but too much will make it greasy but duhh, its oil so..</li>
    <li> i recieved this item from influenster to review and let me tell u i absolutly love it! leaves my hair smelling amazing and doesnt leave it greasy like other products.</li>
    <li> I received the Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection, complementary, for reviewing purposes. I am a hairstylist and am used to using high quality products. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the quality and performance of this collection. Especially the Illuminating Dry Oil Spray. It is amazing. Perfect texture and amount of shine. I will definitely be repurchasing the Dry OIl spray. The shampoo and conditioner smell great and left my hair silky and smooth. My hair looked gorgeous and shiny after I dried and styled it. Great job with this collections Herbal Essences! Thank You, Influenster, for sending these products to me to try!</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Dry Oil Spray is a great idea...only executed in mildly successful fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly smells nice...and leaves a noticeable semblance of shine. On curly hair, however, the moisturizing was more oily than nourishing, and ended up darkening hair at points of application. FYI: It was applied to dry hair, as per instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We (being the better half) was hesitant to re-apply for more darkened, oily mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the Illuminating Dry Oil Spray works better on thinner, straight hair. For curly hair, however, there are better choices within the Herbal Essences&#x27; Wild Naturals line. The Rejuvenating Conditioner, for example, is a star.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how good or bad this product works, the smell is absolutely horrendous! It will be going directly in the garbage (unless maybe my daughter wants it).  From what I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t look like it did much of anything to my hair (maybe its ever so slightly less frizzy).  I have to wash my hair again though to get this smell out.  Its so disgusting!</li>
    <li> I like that it does not impart a strong smell.  However, I just think it makes my hair kind of greasy feeling. I guess I&#x27;m not that much of a hair product person.</li>
    <li> Hair type: below shoulders, very baby fine, highlighted    This is one of those times when I should have followed my first instincts and not ordered this hair product from the Vine program. I don&#x27;t like writing \\&quot;negative\\&quot; reviews, and try to order items I know I will enjoy and use. I had a feeling this product wouldn&#x27;t be right for my hair, but I was curious and wanted to give it a try. However, this hair product is just not right for me. It&#x27;s a little too oily for my very baby fine hair--though this is called a \\&quot;dry oil,\\&quot; it still made my hair look a little too oily and weighted down. Though I will say that it did absorb into my hair after an hour or so, but still, my hair looked a little \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; from it. No fault of the product&#x27;s quality, but only that my hair just did not do well with the oil. I didn&#x27;t notice the shine so much, but since I highlight my hair, it&#x27;s much harder to see the shine it used to have when darker.    What I did like about this product is that the scent is pleasing--a light citrus with a little bit of a floral undertone. I imagine it would do well in the colder winter months when the air is very dry--when I lived in the mountains where it was cold and very dry, this product may have done better for my hair, but now that I&#x27;m in Texas, not so much. I could see using a tiny bit to smooth fly-aways; however, I&#x27;d have to be extremely careful not to use too much. I thought perhaps I&#x27;d spray just a tiny bit on my hands, rub my palms together, and distribute just a little on the ends - just to have that nice scent to my hair and perhaps smooth any fly-aways. But in the summer, there&#x27;s no way my baby fine hair will accept this product. Dang my baby fine persnickity hair!    If your hair isn&#x27;t so very baby fine like mine is, this product may be great for you. The \\&quot;dry oil\\&quot; may absorb much better into thicker hair that needs extra moisture rather than really fine hair that tends to be oilier.</li>
    <li> The spray smells very nice. I used it both on dry and on wet hair, and both ways it made my hair shinier. Unfortunately, it also somewhat weighs the hair down, and make it look a bit darker in shade. I even tried doing a tiny puff in my hand and then spreading it on the hair, and it still too heavy, maybe my hair is too thin?</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, so maybe that&#x27;s why this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I tried it both on damp hair and completely dry hair (as the product recommends) and on damp hair I didn&#x27;t notice anything. With dry hair, it made my hair look a bit oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for people with thicker or more coarse hair, this might work out better and add some shine. It didn&#x27;t add weight, which was nice, but it didn&#x27;t add a whole lot of anything that I wanted around either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is subtle and the has a good mist to distribute to large areas of your hair without saturating areas - which are also good things about the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know. Maybe I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;get&amp;#34; it or don&#x27;t have the right hair type for this product, but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll be purchasing again. I can see there being a market for it with different hair types and even potential hair styles (a sleeked back top bun, maybe?).</li>
    <li> I received the product free from Influenster. I notices the great smell first. I always notice the smell first. I recieved three products, the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection Shampoo, Conditioner and Dry Oil Spray. I have fine wavy hair and do not like products to way down my hair. Neither product way down my hair. The Dry Oil Spray did not make my hair feel to oily but I have learned never use a lot of oil. i did the same with this product. My hair felt clean, smelled fresh and looked great. I love the products.</li>
    <li> I was sent a free sample of this from Influenster and honestly it works amazingly. Within just a few washes I could definiltey see a difference in my hair. It was way shinier and healthier! It is a fabulous drugstore product that compares to many higher end drugstore brands. I am absolutley in love with it!!!!</li>
    <li> Loved the shine this product gave my hair! I received it to test and review thanks to Influenster and loved the fact that it had essential oils in it. I used it on both my wet and dry hair and both results were really nice. I also used it to refresh my hair after a couple of days without shampoo. The great smell lasted and it really did work. My hair is pretty think so I either sprayed and then brushed it through or massaged it in my hair. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I Got this Free to try and review. Let me Start off with I have coarse damaged hair from a lot of dying. and right after the first use I noticed a difference in how my hair felt. I only used one pump of it and it made my hair soft and manageable and Shiny. I would Defiantly recommend this if you have dry damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to review. I really like the way this stuff smells. It has a light, fruity/floral scent. It does go on dry, which is neat because it is a liquid. It makes your hair shiny, but actually I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it for that. I&#x27;d be more likely to use it when hair needs a refresher (makes it smell nice/clean).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used shine sprays in the past that left some unpleasant, sticky residue/coating on my hair, or were comprised of so much alcohol that they dried my hair out horribly.  So I was a little leery about trying another one, but this one (happily) doesn&#x27;t do either of those things.  What it does do is impart a decent amount of long-lasting shine, while keeping the hair looking moisturized and pretty healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, there are a couple of things of which people who pick this product up should be aware:  First, there is the issue of the aroma.  Other reviewers have mentioned it, of course, but it does need to be said that this is a highly fragranced product - the fruity/citrus smell is intense.  Generally, I think it smells pretty good, and after awhile (at least for me), the smell usually decreases in intensity a bit so that it isn&#x27;t like I&#x27;m walking around in a cloud of the aroma all day. However, those who are sensitive to fragrances (as I tend to be) do need to watch out, because on a couple of occasions, the fragrance got to me and did give me a headache or made a pre-existing one worse.  That didn&#x27;t happen every time that I used it, but it is something of which people should be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the directions call for just a small amount of product to be used at one time - something like a couple of sprays, I believe.  The problem with that is that if you have a lot of hair, a couple of sprays won&#x27;t seem to do much at all.  My hair is mid-back, coarse, and very thick.  The first time I tried the spray, I followed the directions, and the relatively small amount of product that was sprayed may as well never have been used.  I find that in order to ensure that enough product gets on my hair, I have to at least double the amount mentioned in the directions.  I&#x27;m not talking about over-loading the hair with product, but using enough that it feels like the spray isn&#x27;t just concentrated in a relatively small area when there is a lot of ground (soto speak) that it has to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, the shine this provides is lovely, and I&#x27;ve found that to be true both when I&#x27;ve straightened my hair, and when I&#x27;ve embraced its natural curly/wurly texture.  This isn&#x27;t a miracle or holy grail kind of product, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good shine spray, this will probably do the trick for you.</li>
    <li> Influenster  just gave me Herbal Essences wild naturals complimentary to tryout, test, and review! It Smells so good, Omg &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 This is a very nice dry oil It&#x27;s light on the hair and does not have any stickiness like some other products I&#x27;ve used. It smells very natural spa-like scent that is not overwhelming and very pleasant. My hair looks and feels very smooth and moisture after using Herbal Essences wild naturals thanks again influenster..so far I will be adding it to my daily regiment.</li>
    <li> I just received a bottle of this for free from influencer.com for testing &amp; review. I don&#x27;t normally buy dry oil sprays anymore because most that I&#x27;ve tried just left a greasy film on my hair that felt heavy &amp; dirty. The Herbal Essence Wild Naturals dry oil is great! It is light &amp; airy with an exotic scent that isn&#x27;t too strong. I used it early in the morning and it kept my hair soft &amp; shiny all day long. I never got that gross feeling like there was too much product on my hair. You only need 2-3 squirts so the small bottle should last a long time.  Also it can be used in damp or dry hair which is a big plus because I rarely use a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> In love with the fragrance of the Herbal Essences Dry Oil Spray from the Wild Naturals Illuminating line.  The scent embodies summertime to me; it&#x27;s the closest thing to a tropical vacation that I have had all winter long! It&#x27;s a light spray mist that imparts shine into your hair while hydrating your locks with moisture. You can use the product on damp or dry hair, of course I tried both!  I was hesitant to spray the product in my dry hair as I sometimes experience limpness when I&#x27;ve tried the same with other oils however the Wild Naturals Dry Oil Spray worked like a charm.  My hair was deliciously fragrant, shiny, and it retained the full volume and bounce that I had after blow drying. I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Collection complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. Ever since I received my Herbal Essences VoxBox, I have been using the Dry Oil Spray non-stop; I just adore how fragrant the Dry Oil Spray makes my hair.</li>
    <li> I always fight with a cross between oily hair and lifeless dull hair. Was given this product to try and now I&#x27;m in love gives you a shine  and doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily at all and I&#x27;m not fighting the dull hair anymore.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this stuff from Influenster. It is amazing! My hair is very thick, middle of my back length and very coarse and dry due to the winter weather and from dyeing it. I used the shampoo and conditioner that goes with the spray and my hair is so smooth and soft. It hasn&#x27;t been this way since last summer and I love it. I will for sure buy this stuff again. It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling wet like I expected it to. It also smells great.</li>
    <li> Shoulder length thin fine hair.  Smells amazing!  As a normal herbal essence  user totally twisted was my favorite but I&#x27;m growing to love the illuminating shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;ve noticed a shine,  but i believe it will take a few more uses too know for sure. One thing for sure,  i will be buying more.  Thanks voxer!</li>
    <li> I was given a sample to test and review, along with a sample of the same blend shampoo and conditioner.  I am kind of a hair care snob.  My products need to smell good, lather well, and leave my hair squeaky clean, with volume and moisture.  I was extremely happy.ðŸ˜™  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have wavey and very dry hair and this stuff made my hair have a beautiful natural shine and smells very good.  I also used it with the shampoo and conditioner which I highly recommend if your looking for added shine.</li>
    <li> The smell is absolutely fabulous. It leaves a perfect non greasy shine.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;the leave my hair with a oily look or feel.</li>
    <li> I have long, curly, &amp; highlighted hair, &amp; this is one of the best oils I&#x27;ve used in my hair. It smells fantastic (like most Herbal Essences products). Using it with the matching shampoo &amp; conditioner makes the smell last even longer. It&#x27;s lightweight &amp; leaves my hair feeling super-soft when it&#x27;s dry. I applied a few sprays to the ends of my hair &amp; combed it through with my fingers as I blow dried my hair. I like that it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or heavy after drying it (even my roots weren&#x27;t weighed down). One piece of advice: apply only a few sprays the first time you use it. Compared to other oils, it is harder to tell how much you need when applied to wet hair. I would recommend this product to a friend, &amp; I will purchase it in the future. I received these products for free from Influenster to test and review.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have dry curly hair and this spray is great for my hair!  It&#x27;s the perfect size to carry with you for whenever you&#x27;re out and about and your hair is in need of a little mist of shine.  It smells AMAZING as well and the fragrance lingers for hours keeping you and your hair looking great and smelling great. I would definitely recommend this product, especially for those curly haired people out there.</li>
    <li> I got this from influenster, thank you so much to them. It&#x27;s all I use everyday, it smells like trident tropical gum. It&#x27;s lovely. all i use is this, i have no need for anything else. taking w me to disney i love it!!!!! THANKYOU INFLUENSTER</li>
    <li> I got this product for testing purposes from #influenster and for my first #VoxBox it was awesome! My hair is thick and oily to begin with buy the ends of my hair is dry but when i used this spray and blended it in. I loved it! Thanks @influenster</li>
    <li> Received to test and review from influenster and I did like the product. Gives your hair a little bit of volume without leaving oily shine behind.</li>
    <li> I have mid back length curly frizzy hair. Only a couple of sprays were needed to add a nice sheen and no sticky feel. Stayed soft and shiny and didn&#x27;t ruin the styling of my hair I had jus done. I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I recived this from influenster to try and review for free. I&#x27;ve been in  a healthy hair kick lately, so this was a perfect addition to my collection. Put it on after my shower, especially on the ends of my hair, and randomly through out the day to keep fly aways at bay.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product to compliment the shampoo and conditioner of the same line, but honestly I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much for my hair. I tried it one day and let my hair air dry and I tried it on a day I blow dried my hair and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference on either day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a sample of this product to test and review.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample for testing purposes. It makes my hair shiny :)</li>
    <li> I received this in a VOXBOX and was so happy to get it! It smells SOO good and makes my hair shine like crazy! I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant, fragrant light oil spray that works best on my hair after deep conditioning. It delivers shine without weighing it down without oily/greasy residue. I use the Rejuvenating Intensely conditioning version the rest of the time; a little bit heavier, but is overkill on deep conditioned hair. It&#x27;s great to use in between deep conditioning treatments which usually have an oil component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend BOTH products which are good for their stated purposes Illuminating or Intense conditioning. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump started out delivering a light mist but has since started delivering an oil stream. Hint: Spray into your hand, rub your palms to warm the oil up and run your fingers through the ends of your hair first, then a light run through the rest of your hair, steering clear of your scalp.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product.  I am 66 years old and my hair is thinning and dry.  This product, when sprayed on my hair and having been shampooed and dried, leaves my hair with a healthy shine.  It doesn&#x27;t feel oily either.  Highly recommended and I feel the price is fair.</li>
    <li> Hair type: super thick, coarse, naturally wavy, to the middle of my back below shoulders (plus I often straighten it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine spray I&#x27;d been using the past few years went off the market and I finally just used the last of my rations...so I was in the market for new, somewhat inexpensive, replacement. And this is definitely it--it smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t add TOO much shine. The only thing is that I&#x27;m guessing they underestimate the amount you need to use on your hair. I do have a lot of hair and when I straighten it and use this spray, I used about 18 squirts (versus the 1-2 the bottle instructions say). But, I also do a few spritzes on each layer as I dry it to help smooth it out. But still, at this price point, I have no problems with using that much more than they recommend. I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I received a 2.8 fl oz bottle for free in my Voxbox and I already love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I have very textured thick hair that can be vey frizzy without the use of a good smoothing product. I used this product right before I blow dried my hair and used a small spray of it to finish my hair as well after straightening with my flat iron and my hair has stayed smooth all day. The smell is very citrusy and crisp, the smell of a spring day! It smells lovely and feels great, I definitely recommend buying this product if your hair is textured and gets frizzy throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair shiny and manageable but does not make it oily or greasy. It has one big drawback in that it makes a real mess in the bathroom. It&#x27;s as though I used spray paint; it coats every surface.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair pretty and shiny! I apply this before I dry my hair and after it is dried. my hair is pretty long so the ends tend to look a little dull sometimes so this definitely brings more life into my hair!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair, usually it&#x27;s very dull and sad. I used this on it after a shower, while my hair was still wet and it really does shine. If you spray it on dry hair, you really have to make sure it&#x27;s just a light mist. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product that I would definitely recommend as well as the shampoo and conditioner that are a part of the wild naturals collection.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product. It made my hair very soft and healthy. I recommend this. I got this for free due to influenster and I loved this .</li>
    <li> I received this as a set from influenster, while I love the smell, I hate that it makes my hair glossy/greasy. I think its a combination of the shampoo and conditioner as well. I may just use this set every once and awhile.</li>
    <li> I received this via influenster to test and I was not disappointed at all! I sprayed a light mist of this after I towel dried my hair and it had such an odd feel; in a good way. It was exactly that; a dry oil. My hair feels incredibly soft and I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this product.  It has made our hair feel soft without leaving any heavy residue or oil behind.  We received this from Influenster in a Voxbox along with the Shampoo and Condtioner.  All of these products leaves a nice smelling citrus smell to your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not that sure how much this did for my hair, but despite wearing a fitted scrub cap for two long days straight at work, my hair still had a nice shine and never felt greasy (or at least greasier than usual by the second day). I used this with the shampoo and conditioner of the same line. My biggest point of contention and the deal breaker for why I&#x27;d probably never buy this product in the future: The scent. It&#x27;s too fruity/floral/sweet, and the scent is so strong, especially in a hot shower. This may not bother other people as it does me since I tend to be fairly sensitive to fragrance and can get headaches from it, regardless of price point or type of fragrance. It&#x27;s just not my thing. I received a trial of this shampoo free through Influenster in order to review. I have not let this influence my opinion.</li>
    <li> The product smells wonderful. I recieved a free sample from influenster to try but unfortunately it left me hair feeling a bit to oily. The shampoo and conditioner in this line work great but the spray was not for me.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited when I received this product to test. The first thing I did, with any new hair product I use, is to check and see how it smells. It smells really good in the bottle, while washing my hair, and even after I blew dried by hair. Usually the smell from the shampoo and conditioners aren’t noticeable after you blow dry your hair but my hair still smelled good. I was able to see that the shampoo and conditioner did make a difference in terms of the shine when I just used the shampoo and conditioner alone. When I used them plus the Dry Oil Spray, it made my hair look more greasy and oily than clean and shiny. I will be buying the shampoo and conditioner but will not be buying the Dry Oil Spray in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free to test and review but the opinions are all mine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The smell is amazing and it leaves a nice light shine on hair.</li>
    <li> This product does what it promises.  Your hair is shiny and light reflecting.  I have think hair so I used it sparingly.  I loved it when I had my hair in a ponytail the sheen was beautiful.  My only complaint was I found the smell a bit overwhelming but that is a personal issue with me as I am very sensitive to fragrances.  I was given this product for review by Influenster.</li>
    <li> Have to be very light handed with this.  A little goes a long way.  Kind of a weird smell at first, but it seems to go away after a bit.  It does make hair shiny.</li>
    <li> The ingredient list is missing from the listing, and since I know so many people (especially those in the Curly and Wavy communities) who find that so important, I have the list here for you.  (Ingredients at the time of this post; manufacturers can always change them in the future).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Cyclopentasiloxane , Dimethicone , Prunus Armeniaca Kernel Oil , Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil , Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil , Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is strictly for &amp;#34;label readers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, very silicone based.  Which could be either good or bad, depending on your hair&#x27;s needs.  These are also non-water-soluble &#x27;cones, so this is not &amp;#34;CG.&amp;#34;  Which, again, in no way means it&#x27;s a bad product!  It may be great if your hair (ad hair routine) likes silicones.  Hair needs are a very individual thing.  I&#x27;m giving this a star score simply because I can&#x27;t post this &amp;#34;review&amp;#34; without a star rating, but I felt the missing ingredient list needed to be supplied.  I tried to make my star score as nuetral as possible.</li>
    <li> Love this product for taming my winter hat head! No more static-y flyaways, and it doesn&#x27;t make my fine blonde hair oily or greasy. I spray two pumps into my hand and work it over all my ends, then one spray to lightly mist my whole head.  I would use this product for the amazing scent alone- it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating dry oil spray is a great product at a very reasonable price. It did make my flyaway hair lustrous and manageable. It made my hair feel very soft to the touch.  Best of all, it does not weigh hair down. It has a wonderful flowery scent that I like a lot. Although I prefer the natural almond oil I usually use on my hair, this is great for those who want a quick and easy fix. However, there are some chemicals in this product.</li>
    <li> light fresh scent to this product is great if you are like me and have frizzy ends to your hair. I spray just the ends of my hair, and this product leaves my hair shiny but not oily looking. Also it is much more manageable hair after I use it. Great for every day use. and I love the scent is not over whelming.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that its dry oil and does not make my hairs oily.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply, I do not spray it directly on my hairs as I have long thick hairs and it would take alot of oil otherwise. so I just spray it on my hand, rub both hands together, and apply it. My hairs feels shiny, and nourished. I am using it on my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hairs too, and I feel that after using this oil her hairs look shinier than mine :)&lt;br /&gt;One more thing my hands and hairs are never sticky or greasy after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product and I would recommend it not just for the shine but for nourishment too.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair slightly more shiny but that&#x27;s about it. It says to use one or two sprays but that seems like it does nothing so I used more. Not worth buying again in my opinion.</li>
    <li> *I&#x27;m using this product for free to test and review*&lt;br /&gt;I love shine sprays, so I was excited to start using this one right away. I used it after I washed my hair using H.E.shampoo and conditioner. I styled (hairdryer) and sprayed a few times on my hair. Instantly, I noticed the awesome smell! I only used about 2-3 pumps on my hair and it was great. I noticed the sheen right away and it lasted most of the day.</li>
    <li> I used this product right away when I received it in the mail. I love the smell of it and it gives my hair that extra shine since my hair is usually dry. As for me this product did not weigh down my hair. I sprayed to pumps into my hands and then ran my hands and fingers through my hair. I used the extra product from my palms on the top of my head for the flyaways. I really liked how it made my hair look.&lt;br /&gt;**I did receive this product free to test and review.**</li>
    <li> I tried this for the very first time after trying it with the matching shampoo and conditioner set.  I received it to try via Influenster VoxBox for free so I was really excited to give it a shot.  I have oily hair so I was concerned that it would weigh my hair down but the very opposite is what happened.  I used it as instructed by spraying my hairbrush and then drying my hair.  When I was done styling my hair with the blowdryer I gave it one more spritz to &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; my hair.  I was left with hair that is so soft to the touch and smells great.  It is quite shiny but not oily looking.  I can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to try it since she has beautiful long hair that she loves to have shiny and smooth.  It&#x27;s definitely a product for all hair types to benefit from.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I can use it right after the shower or even when my hair is dry and it won&#x27;t leave my hair oily. The fragrance is also wonderful but not over powering. I&#x27;d definitely buy it and use it all the time!</li>
    <li> My hair is thin so I can only use a little bit but it makes my hair shiny and soft</li>
    <li> First of all, I received samples of he dry oil, shampoo and conditioner so I didn&#x27;t purchase them from Amazon directly.&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the product review. Like all of Herbal Essences products, this smells really nice if not a little too girly. And the scent lasted all day and into the next morning. I&#x27;ve got fine hair so I didn&#x27;t use much of the oil, just one spray and then rubbed through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It gave my hair some shine, it is oil after all. Over all I&#x27;d say it worked as expected.</li>
    <li> I received the dry oil to test and I like it. This product is lightweight and does add shine. I added to my hair when wet &amp; let it air dry and saw a difference. I can&#x27;t wait til it&#x27;s warmer out to see how it does in the humidity.</li>
    <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals product free to test, but this review is completely my thoughts. First thought - I love the smell of these products! I have a lot of fine hair, but it&#x27;s naturally curly. The product is for &amp;#34;unleashing your hair&#x27;s natural shine&amp;#34; and that is what it did. I sprayed this in my damp hair and it helped keep the shine. BUT my favorite way to use this was on my daughters hair. She has very staticky hair, I just sprayed this on a couple times and it help keep it in place.</li>
    <li> Got this for review through Influenster. I love this almost as much as my current products. Great scent and makes hair shiny without weighing down. Definitely a top product</li>
    <li> I love the feeling and smell</li>
    <li> I received this through voxbox for reviewing purposes. I really liked this spray I was able to use just a tiny amount(two sprays) on my long thick hair. It left it shiny any soft. I really love how this product worked on my hair and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to test and review and was a little skeptical at first (I&#x27;ve tried products like this in the past and was unhappy about it). I tried it just after a shower in the morning and it smelled INCREDIBLE! I actually wish I could get this scent in a body spray it was that good. I went against initial directions (1-2 sprays) and probably did more like 3-4, BAD IDEA! It did not illuminate my hair, in fact it made it a bit dull. I have ashy blonde hair with a few lighter blonde highlights in it. It definitely picks up the oils in products so I have to be very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try it again using less and the results were a bit better, but I still don&#x27;t think its a good fit for my particular hair coloring/texture.</li>
    <li> I got this product free to test and review.  I like the way it left my hair.  It gave it a shiny look without being too greasy.  I used the spray along with the shampoo and conditioner and liked the results.  The only negative to the spray is the smell.</li>
    <li> **I received this product free for the purpose of testing and reviewing. All opinions are my own.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this spray. The smell is really wonderful. Very sweet and interesting. Not a scent I&#x27;ve often experienced in other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this spray in my damp hair after washing and conditioning, then allowed it to air dry. My naturally curly/wavy hair felt much softer and much more manageable after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then applied this spray to my hair when dry and styled my hair using this product. My usually thick, coarse hair was tamed because of using this spray during the styling process and after. There were fewer frizzies and fly aways than had I not used the spray. I live in a humid region and this spray helped my combat the tendency towards frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating line and will be using it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle in my Vox Box from Influenster.com and I am pleased with the results of this product.  I do have to say that a little goes a long way.  If I use too much, my hair loses it&#x27;s silkiness and starts to stick together, but I&#x27;ve adjusted to just one spritz in each section of my hair after a blow dry and and it made a world of difference to my styled look.</li>
    <li> I got this in my Influenster box and I have only used it once or twice because the shampoo and conditioner make my hair shiny enough on their own, but this smells AMAZING. So so good. I have used this when I have pushed my washing an extra day and had to use dry shampoo. It did leave my hair softer and shinier, but I don&#x27;t need it all the time.</li>
    <li> This oil spray is okay, but no miracle cure. It left my hair somewhat shinier and less frizzy, but not enough for me to purchase again. I have thick curls, so this didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all, and I put more than the two recommended pumps on. I don&#x27;t love the smell, and will continue to use Redken&#x27;s Diamond Oil as my oil of choice, but this was nice to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free to test and review.</li>
    <li> I got this product in an Influenster box for free to review, and I have to say that I really like it. I think that it has an incredibly nice citrus smell, and that makes it very pleasant to use. I used the product straight after I get out of the shower, and before I blow dry my hair. I do 3-4 spritz&#x27;s around my hair, and begin my blowout. I really like the extra shine it gives my hair! It isn&#x27;t a smoothing spray though, but does give my hair a brighter look. I really enjoy the product and what it does to the look of my hair. This spray leaves my looking sleek, shiny and stylish!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have dry brittle hair that is literately \\&quot;hard\\&quot;  This product not only smells fantastic it softens and shines MY hair. This a dry oil spray but it does not make your hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so different but in a good way. The sprayer emits a very fine mist. A little goes a long way making this product an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The unique scent is light,sweet and floral but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;* The product just works! It softens and shines my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;* The sprayer emits a very fine mist. You need to use only a small amount of product to get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am super impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: if you are trying to decide between this product and the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Oil Elixir...I would say that the Dry oil spray is the slightly better product.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating dry oil spray is a a complimentary product I received from Influenster to test and review. It did make make my hair lustrous, shiny and very soft to the touch. Best of all, it is light and does not make my hair heavy and sticky. It is a great product especially in this cold weather that has your hair looking all limp and dry.</li>
    <li> Truly like the look, feel and overall results of this product.  And having tried it on dry hair and on wet clean hair, it worked well both ways.  The only drawback for me is the smell.  While the aroma is not unpleasant, it is extremely strong.  The good thing is, the odor does quickly fade, so that makes it okay, and why it rates 4 stars with me.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the dry oils. I like them because a little goes a long way for hydration and they add extra conditioning to dry, over worked hair making it manageable and shiny. I like this Herbal Essences oil a lot because it smells really good and adds extra shine. Used in combination with the shampoo and conditioner of the same Wild Naturals it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several oil sprays and they last a long time. Just a couple of sprays before using a hot iron helps to not burn my hair and damage the ends of my hair that always get frazzled because of the hot iron and blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this oil a lot and I love the light, clean scent.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair that kinks and curls as soon as it dries. I&#x27;ve tried various oils and disliked the smell and the greasy result. I was delightfully surprised by this Herbal Essences dry oil. A few spritzes a comb through - and my hair is shiny and healthy-looking, without the dry kinkiness I am always battling. I was also surprised by the pleasant smell of the spray. It is subtle, but nice all the same. I can run my fingers through my hair without getting oily residue on my hands.</li>
    <li> First off -- I&#x27;m always surprised by size when I order online -- note the size, 2.8 oz. That means it&#x27;s small enough to be a carry-on item. It also means the printed instructions for usage were pretty small for this 44 year old to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the product. I like it. I have medium coarse, wavy hair. The ends tend to be dry. When I wear my hair straight, I also tend to have some flyaways, and I wondered if this would help with it. I think it did. It definitely provided the shine it promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it when I went with natural curls. I think that it worked fairly well then as well. I especially liked it when I pulled my curly hair back in a bun. I like doing that when my hair is curly, to give it texture, but this also gave it some shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated a month or so later: I wear my hair many different ways -- straight, pulled back, down, curly, wavy etc.  In addition to using it on curls, as I mentioned above, I do tend to use it on day 2 or 3 of wearing my hair straightened, in between shampoos. Two weeks in a row, I got compliments out of the blue on my hair. It looked the same (when I wear it straight and down), but they were effusive in their praise. What was different? Well, it was day 3 of no shampoo (I always shampoo on day 3 or 4, usually 3), which can be iffy, but apparently the shiny boost got noticed!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this product would work, but it ended up exceeding my expectations.  This oil spray can be used on either dry or wet hair.  I tried it on both.  On wet hair this works like any other smoothing product.  It helps to decrease frizz, make hair more combable, and generally provide some heat protection (at least, so it seems).  I think it works better on dry hair.  On dry hair a couple spritzes of this really does make hair softer and smoother.  It smoothed my frizz right down when I brushed it through.  This spray also has a gorgeous scent- it smells like tropical fruits and flowers.  I was a bit worried about dispensing hair oil through a spray, since too much oil could be a disaster, but this sprayer dispenses a very fine mist.  No worries about too much in one spritz.  I&#x27;d still advise taking it slowly, since a little really does go a long way.  In sum, I really liked this spray and will definitely purchase more when this bottle is finished.</li>
    <li> First of all I was unable to get it to spray.  I tried and tried and it just won&#x27;t spray.  I have idea why, it looks like a normal spray head.  So I just put some on my hands and applied it to damp hair.  My hair is fine and dry and I think the product made it shiny without being oily looking.  I am sensitive to smells and this did not seem an overwhelming or distasteful smell to me.  It also feels very nice on my very dry wintertime hands.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a complimentary for testing purposes from influenster and absolutely loved it.</li>
    <li> I received this item free courtesy of influenster for test and review purposes and i really enjoyed it! The smell is wonderful, it&#x27;s a bit citrusy but unlike other hair sprays, the smell actually lasts. I am a huge fan of fruity smelling products so it earns a star for its scent right off the bat. The texture of the spray is oily and I was worried it was going to leave my hair feeling oily and looking greasy, but it was actually the opposite. I used it on my hair while it was dry, and even though it says use one to two sprays, i sprayed my hair about 4 times since it is a bit thicker than average, and my hair was left feeling really soft with a bit of shine, that wasn&#x27;t overwhelming or greasy looking. I can only imagine how my hair will look and feel when it is slightly damp! I am hesitant when adding product to my hair other than shampoo and conditioner because i like to keep it as natural as possible, but this is one product that I will be coming back for more!</li>
    <li> love how it makes my hair feel&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i received this product in return for my review</li>
    <li> This product was given to me complimentary, and it smelled amazing! It also made my hair feel so soft!</li>
    <li> Great product. I received this from Influenster for reviewing purposes. I honestly thought it was going to leave my hair feeling dry and brittle but on the contrary this is a must have for me from now on. I have natural curly waist length hair that has always given me problems. It is very frizzy, gets tangled easily, and even when I apply mouse, gel or hair spray it will not calm down and stay shaped. However, after spraying this all over my hair on my damp hair and letting it air dry like I usually do I was very satisfied with this. After I finish my sample I do see myself buying it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free from influenser. Works as good as most argon or coconut oils, though i think it runs out pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Was a little nervous about trying this out. I was afraid it may leave my hair feeling oily, bit I sprayed it into my hands then ran in through my hair.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product complimentary to test via Influenster and I love it.!  I have very fine hair and just the tiniest mist made my hair have the silkiest shine.. Not to mention the pleasing but not overpowering scent  Will be purchasing this item after my free sample is gone</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, and it is also dry and lacks shine. This lightweight oil added shine and moisturizes my hair. It also smells soooo good!</li>
    <li> The product smells great! And worked great in a friends hair but on my thick purple hair it made it look greasy but I also feel like I put way to much in! Will deff continue using it makes hair nice and shiny :) I would recommend</li>
    <li> Love this spray.  I received a sample from VoxBox and tried the spray first. It made my hair shine without feeling greasy.  Once I starting using the shampoo and conditioner along with it - my hair only looked better.  Love this!</li>
    <li> I received a full size sample from VoxBox and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it! I love these little treats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up being really surprised by this product. It was nice and light on my hair, allowing for multiple refresh sprays for frizz and flyaway. Could work for thin/medium hair. Ended up giving the rest to my mom who has thin, color treated hair. She kept smelling my hair, so I gave in!  I have THICK wavy hair, and it was just perfect for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note...the ingredients are really similar to a dry body oil and it smells amazing. I sprayed it top to toe (not face :)) with no problems at all. Kids at my school commented on it all day (in a good way!)</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Wild Naturals Illuminating dry oil free to test and review. I was very excited to test this product. I washed my hair then sprayed this product on my damped hair. I did a quick blow and then used my hot iron. My hair looks so nice, healthy and shinny! Not to mention it leave your hair smelling extra good. It definitely helped my hair looks skinny instead of dull and frizzy.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more of a liquid, but it&#x27;s a gel. I thought I was going to hate it because oil normally makes my hair more greasy, but this stuff actually made my hair calm down with the frizziness, and it looks more healthy.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product as a sample through influester! And I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this from the influenster voxbox. I was very happy with the fragrance and it was amazing how shiny it made my hair and it wasn&#x27;t oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Love this! This really left my hair feeling soft even after it dried. I normally use more hair product, but took time to really let this take hold of my hair and the results left me excited to try again.</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d the complete set of these as part of my last Vox Box. So far, I&#x27;m really enjoying em. To me, they have a nice citrus scent - almost grapefruit. Its very energizing. I have very dry, straight hair and these made them feel soft - especially the dry oil spray. In fact, this was the best part of the set. It did NOT feel oily at all (i was afraid to use it at first) but it made my hair soft and shiny. Great product for straight hair, esp if you flat iron.</li>
    <li> I received this through my herbal essence VOXBOX. It is okay my hair feels okay after it but I prefer using my coconut oil products since I have extremely curly hair.</li>
    <li> I received this as a free test sample from Influenster. I really like the scent, it lingers for quite some time. Very feminine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have dry, frizzy, curls and this leaves them soft and shiny. It smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls.</li>
    <li> I  received this product in the mail, and I was so excited to try it! I am always looking for new products to make my hair look shiny, soft, and healthy. This product did just that. Its spray nozzle evenly distributes the oil and it leaves your hair smelling amazing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. It makes my hair shine like no other. Although, I really do wish it was even more natural and sulfate free because having coarse curly hair requires a lot of conditioninh and little to no alcohol.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best smelling hair products I&#x27;ve ever used. It can be used on wet or dry hair, and it is marketed to help amplify shine. I initially tried it with wet hair, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all (except the great smell!). Next, I used it with dry hair, after I had straightened it. It does make a noticeable difference on dry hair, but you have to be careful: too little, and there&#x27;s no difference, a bit too much (or too close to your roots), and you&#x27;re left with a greasy mess. However, I do think it makes dry hair look nice and shiny: just be careful with your application!</li>
    <li> Smells delicious!!! A few sprays goes a long way !</li>
    <li> This is a very nice silicon spray for making hair shine. Put it on to either damp or dry hair (I prefer putting it on damp hair as it seals some moisture in that way) and it makes hair super easy to comb knots out of and gives a lovely shine. I have super fine (but very damaged) hair and a lot of shine products are just too heavy for it; this spray- as long as I don&#x27;t go nuts with it- is light enough to work well for me. I have found that I don&#x27;t have to use a conditioner if I use this spray. It is easy to over do it and get too much- I&#x27;ve found about three pumps of the mister does it for me- I rub the product through my hair thoroughly. It has a nice, light scent.</li>
    <li> I love how lightweight and non-greasy this spray leaves my naturally oily hair feeling. It keeps it from getting frizzy, defines my natural waves and leaves no gunky buildup. The only downside is that the scent of the spray is not too pleasant initially, but it fades pretty quickly and settles into a more pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an affordable product that measures up very well to more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> *I was sent this product for review*&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry hair and I have to dry it every day so that takes away a lot of the shine and make its looks dry and dull. I tried this spray upon receiving and it did add shine but the spray bottle did get a lot of greece on my hands.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. Really helped me tame my frizzy hair. It smells so good. The oil is very thick so you don&#x27;t need to use too much. I got mine from Influenster for free to test and review. I used the shampoo by massaging it into my hair, then after I washed off the shampoo i put on the conditioner then rinsed it away. After, my hair dried I put on the oil that I also received with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this out. I have very dry curly hair but I normally straighten it. I&#x27;m always trying new products to add shine and softness to my hair. This oil smells amazing. It has a fruity citrus scent. I had a few people ask what smelled so great. I styled my hair as usual. Dried then flat ironed it. Finished with this oil. It is light weight and added a great sheen and made my hair nice and soft. So glad i was sent this to test out. I will definitely repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to test and review. I really happy that i got it because I liked it a lot. It made my hair really soft, without leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I used this right after I got out the shower, spritz some in my hair. I absolutely love the shine this product gives my hair. It is amazing! And it smells sooo good. No complaints here! *received this for free for testing purposes*</li>
    <li> I love the smell and shine!</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster for test and review. It was fabulous for my hair during this harsh winter. Great shine and smell. The Illuminating shampoos were the bomb as well that came with the oil. My hair is course, thick and curly and can look dull. It did not weigh it down at all. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The product is okay if you don&#x27;t put too much. My hair is really thick and usually holds in oily products but this was a bit much. I prefer to spray it on my hands first and then put it in my hair. That&#x27;s the way it will work for me. My hair is long to my waist thick and curly. I got this product complimentary to test and will buy it in the future since it smells good. Although it wouldn&#x27;t be my go to product for shine. If it&#x27;s oily for thick hair I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t for for thin/normal hair unless you put it in your hands first.</li>
    <li> I got this as sample along with the illuminating shampoo and conditioner from Influenster in a VoxBox on Tuesday to test and review. In just a few days I already see and feel a difference in my hair. This spray gives my hair a nice shine and I love the scent. I would definitely buy this product in the future!  Great hair products!!!</li>
    <li> I received this Dry Oil Spray for free and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  This is not a type of product I would usually buy for my hair.  It has a nice gentle smell and leaves my hair shiny.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it left any build up, which is something I stay away from in a product.  I used this product both on wet hair and dry hair.  Personally I liked the way it turned out on wet.</li>
    <li> I really like this dry oil - I received it as a trial product through influenster.  The main thing is that it did not make me break out.  I have sensitive skin and am always worried new products will cause breakouts and this did not. I will definitely be adding this to my haircare regimen!!  It added great shine to my hair and I think helped protect and nourish it.  I have platinum blonde bleached hair and it tends to be damaged.  After I styled my hair this was the perfect finishing touch - not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I think that Herbal Essences did a great job with the fragrance of this product. But the condition that this stuff left my hair in was terrible. I had to deep condition several time to fix the damage caused by using this line of products received from Influenster. So very drying! I cannot recommend and will not even finish the product sent to me. Will never purchase.</li>
    <li> I have recieved this product complementary of VoxBox and let me just say I absolutely love it. I have course, thick, textured hair, and it&#x27;s very curly too. This makes my hair incredibly soft and my curls are outstanding. It&#x27;s very manageable one and it smells amazing. I would recommend this product to anyone who has thick hair, but it may make thin hair a little greasy.</li>
    <li> I received this product from Influenster to test out and I have been using it everyday since I received it! The first thing I always do when I look at hair products is to read the ingredients. When I saw that this shine spray doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it I was pleasantly surprised!! Most shine products have alcohol in them which is why I usually avoid them. This product has a lot of natural ingredients in it and seems to have a conditioning effect on my hair. I love that this is more than just a shine product, it also improves the health of my hair. Lastly, I have a lot of hair, but it is very fine. It is hard to find products that condition and add shine to my hair without also weighing it down and making it look greasy. This product doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy and it has a beautiful tropical smell that doesn&#x27;t smell synthetic. I recommend spraying the product in your hand and then applying it to your hair rather than directly spraying it on your hair. This way the product is distributed evenly. When my test bottle of this runs out I plan to buy another!</li>
    <li> My normal finishing serum has to be pumped into my palm and then applied to my hair. i love that this serum is a spray and you don&#x27;t have to get your hands dirty! The smell is amazing and I have gotten several comments on how great my hair smells from co-workers and my husband. I highly recommend this product for anyone that needs to style their hair quickly in the morning and wants to to look and smell great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* i received this product for free to test and review.</li>
