      <li>I was hoping for better results.</li>
      <li>As with most things, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
      <li>Even though it isn&#x27;t something that is able to be seen it is still something that bothers me.</li>
      <li>It prepares your skin for your favorite moisturizer.</li>
      <li>and it just sits on the top of my skin.</li>
      <li>My face felt cleaner and smoother and my arms and legs looked more even toned.  </li>
      <li>So far so good!  </li>
      <li>It is so light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Tried a lot of other spot correctors and this one is the best.</li>
      <li>Like with most beauty products, it takes time to see any significant difference.</li>
      <li>Now with that being said and taken the amount of time that I have been using this product, I can easily see that my skin tone is getting a bit lighter.</li>
      <li>This is easy to apply to my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or oily after either.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s become an important part of my beauty regimen now.</li>
      <li>Which meant I have more &amp;#34;freckles&amp;#34; on my right.</li>
      <li>Then today my husband asked me  how I was getting more sun on my right side when I never ride with him, I always drive everywhere</li>
      <li>I purchased this item on promo and have been very pleased with it thus far.</li>
      <li>The smell of this product is light and mild.</li>
      <li>on my skin have faded a bit after several weeks but to call itself the best is a major stretch.</li>
      <li>This is the best  product for improving dark spots!!!.</li>
      <li>Adding it to a good skin care regimen has improved the overall tone of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice, it was others telling me how good my skin looked and asked what I was doing differently.  </li>
      <li>It feels great, smells great, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>The best dark spot corrector I have found so far!</li>
      <li>This is a great dark spot corrector and has worked wonders.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to spend more moolah on a new product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m absolutely blown away by the quality !!</li>
      <li>I will definitely be back for more!</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Aside from making my skin smooth, it really doesn&#x27;t have brightening effect</li>
      <li>I revived my product for discounted or complimentary review</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it once you find what works for you.</li>
      <li>However the seller honors its guarantee, so it may be worth the try and work for others.</li>
      <li>The consistency is just right.</li>
      <li>I began using this product as a part of my daily regimen and have really seen some amazing results.</li>
      <li>At night, I use just a tiny pea size of the liquid to put on my face and a couple of drops for each arm and for each lower leg where I tend to get the most sun damage.  </li>
      <li>I have many sun spots and freckles on my face that I hide with makeup daily.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>After 1 month of once in the morning and once in the evening, my skin is now normal again!!</li>
      <li>The serum is lightweight, quickly absorbs into my skin, and had no side effects on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an effective  and reasonably priced dark spot corrector, this product is for you!</li>
      <li>They really do care about their customers.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>the whole bottle is finished.</li>
      <li>Does absolutely nothing that it claims it does.</li>
      <li>but I sure am pleased with my results thus far, I’m hoping with continued use I will continue to see the spots diminish or at least lighten so much that they will not be visible to others.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a milky white looking substance and when applied, it leaves the skin feeling smooth and radiant.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it cones in a dropperr bottle, so I wont use to much.</li>
      <li>I ordered it for my sister and she says that it works very well.</li>
      <li>however the makers of this product was very accomdating about how they could improve my experience</li>
      <li>really like the way this formula smells very citrus like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Did absolutely NOTHING.</li>
      <li>Will continue to use, but according to most of the other reviews I read before purchasing people had begun to notice a difference a lot sooner.  </li>
      <li>Pink Madison Dark Spot Corrector works great on my skin.</li>
      <li>I can tell with further use that I will be able to see a more subtle appearance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several dark spot correctors in the past and this works the best</li>
      <li>This gave my skin a new even toned look</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s milky white and you distribute it with an eye dropper which is nice to prevent waste.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the consistency of this dark spot corrector.</li>
      <li>I like it so far!</li>
      <li>and I could tell the difference the next morning after the first application.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to try this dark spot corrector.</li>
      <li>I figured I would do all the ladies here a favor and recommend Clear Skin cream for the ones that need something stronger.</li>
      <li>I applied this corrector directly to those areas and then blended it to the surrounding areas of my face and neck.</li>
      <li>I used the entire bottle and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>So far i have used this product about 1month</li>
      <li>Used the complete bottle and followed the instructions.  </li>
      <li>other products is all you can do to find the right one for you.</li>
      <li>First of all, Pink Madison gives you a generous 1oz bottle of serum.</li>
      <li>it has actually faded my age spot areas on my forehead completely!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Have used it on three small spots, three times a day, for four weeks with no improvement.  I researched reviews on dark spot correctors on Amazon for weeks and chose this one because of the high reviews, but no such luck.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it cones in a dropperr bottle, so I wont use to much.My skin feels good no irritation.I got this at a good price for my unbiasrd review</li>
    <li> So I have struggled with under eye spots and let me tell you! This is a dream come true!!leaves my skin looking great! And it&#x27;s scent less!! I revived my product for discounted or complimentary review</li>
    <li> Been using it for three weeks and not seeing any results.</li>
    <li> as promised but use it every day</li>
    <li> So far i have used this product about 1month and i see the dark spots clearing little by little. I&#x27;ll see what the results are after i finish the second bottle.</li>
    <li> As much as I would like to give this 5 stars, I am sorry to say I have used this for 2 weeks plus &amp; don&#x27;t see a bit of difference.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. However the seller honors its guarantee, so it may be worth the try and work for others.</li>
    <li> Used the complete bottle and followed the instructions.  DID NOT EVEN FADE AGE SPOTS.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a lightening of my spots.  I have not used it every night or day like I should, but again, I have noticed a change.</li>
    <li> Do not be afraid to purchase this product, Pink Madison stands 100 percent behind their products!! I am a very satisfied customer! I would recommend that you try it , you have nothing to lose.  Thanks Pink Madison.</li>
    <li> I felt my skin was getting darker</li>
    <li> I wanted to let you all know that Shelby rocks. I was hesitant to spend more moolah on a new product. So I got a great offer and took it, Pink Madison thank you again and I will be updating with my results in a few weeks. Best customer service for me. They really do care about their customers.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my second bottle of dark spot corrector.  I bought it because of the claims it made and the price.  I was quite pleased with the immediate results.  At night, I use just a tiny pea size of the liquid to put on my face and a couple of drops for each arm and for each lower leg where I tend to get the most sun damage.  I have used Obagi hydroquinone in the past but it is so expensive I just can&#x27;t afford to use it anymore.  This gave my skin a new even toned look and I could tell the difference the next morning after the first application.  My face felt cleaner and smoother and my arms and legs looked more even toned.  I think I might try the other pink madison products now.</li>
    <li> I am almost 50 and have had an extended illness so they age spots and freckles are not making me feel any better, so when I was offered this product during a promotion to give my honest opinion I was ecstatic! I have only been using this product for 3 days and i can honestly say I saw improvement over night. I only applied it to the left side of my face and to my left hand so I could tell a difference. I even asked my 11 and 13 yr old boys to try and see which side looks different, and they could tell me! Then today my husband asked me  how I was getting more sun on my right side when I never ride with him, I always drive everywhere I go. Which meant I have more &amp;#34;freckles&amp;#34; on my right. I will have a bottle of this around as long as I am around.</li>
    <li> My first time try too used dark spot corrector</li>
    <li> I have been applying this product two times per day and have not seen any noticeable changes.</li>
    <li> I recived this product in exchange for my honest review. I haven&#x27;t had this very long so I&#x27;m not sure if it works in fading dark spots. I will say it doesn&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and absorbs easily into the skin. When I can tell you if there&#x27;s a change in the appearence of dark spots, I will revise my stars and review. But I was told to just write a current review and this is all I have (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**revised, it&#x27;s been one long enough to tell that my skin hasn&#x27;t chnaged in the least! I will keep it at 2 stars because it didn&#x27;t damage my skin at all or have any adverse effects. But I can say for a fact it didn&#x27;t work for me. Which is unfortunate but true!</li>
    <li> I did not see any change. I&#x27;ve been applying it 2 times a day since I received it and I see no results.  My upper lip still has a dark side .</li>
    <li> This is a great dark spot corrector and has worked wonders. I was born with this weird spot on my thigh that is about the size of a baseball that is just an off color that doesn&#x27;t match my natural skin tone. Even though it isn&#x27;t something that is able to be seen it is still something that bothers me. So I started using this and noticed that it is fading away and my skin tones in that area are starting to match. This is easy to apply to my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or oily after either. I received this to share my honest thoughts and opinions on this product.</li>
    <li> did not work at all! wasted my money</li>
    <li> This product is truly awesome. I have had some dark skin spots for about three years. I began using this product as a part of my daily regimen and have really seen some amazing results. I have used other products before such as the clinique dark spot corrector and it did nothing. I saw lightness of my dark spots by the end of the 1st week with using this product. I highly recommend this product and can assure that you will not be disappointed. Also, the packaging is sophisticated and the value of the product is awesome !</li>
    <li> I bought this in May and have used it for two months. I love the scent and how soft it makes my skin feel, but it hasn&#x27;t made any noticeable difference in the dark spots. After reading the reviews I was hopeful, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great. I think it is working on the spots.</li>
    <li> Have used almost the entire bottle. Can&#x27;t say it reduced my stubborn dark spots drastically but overall I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars as my skin appears to be smoother and lighter. Will purchase another as I think with pigmentation it does take several months sometimes to achieve results.</li>
    <li> I  like it. I uused almost 2 weeks . My dark spots have not really lightned up that much, but my skin lighten up little bit.&lt;br /&gt;not so bad.</li>
    <li> Pink Madison Dark Spot Corrector works great on my skin. I have a a few dark spots on my face that I assume are from tanning and sun bathing. I applied this corrector directly to those areas and then blended it to the surrounding areas of my face and neck. I absolutely love the feeling it gives my skin. It is so light and refreshing. My face looks brighter and I can see the 2 spots on my face beginning to diminish. The smell of this product is light and mild. I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation whatsoever.  If you are looking for an effective  and reasonably priced dark spot corrector, this product is for you!</li>
    <li> The moment I opened up the bottle, I knew that I was in for a treat. To me it has the delicious aroma of citrus zest. I&#x27;m 51 years old and have been battling age spots for a few years now. I&#x27;ve used several products regularly sold in drug stores. I&#x27;ve found that they take months before they even begin to work with regular use. As with most things, you get what you pay for. First of all, Pink Madison gives you a generous 1oz bottle of serum. It&#x27;s milky white and you distribute it with an eye dropper which is nice to prevent waste. The consistency is just right. Not to thin to run but thick enough for your skin to drink. That&#x27;s what it feels like. It feels like your skin is drinking it in. It&#x27;s not oily and not drying. I use it on my face, neck, chest and hands.It prepares your skin for your favorite moisturizer. I like Moroc100 Flight Creme even for my hands. Once your spots are faded, you&#x27;ll want to continue use to keep them away. It&#x27;s easier to prevent them than to get rid of them. I&#x27;m speaking from experience. Thank you Pink Madison for the opportunity to be on your testing team. It&#x27;s become an important part of my beauty regimen now.</li>
    <li> I guess everyone has their own experience. I&#x27;ve tried others with oily breakout no results. This has been a God send for me. It&#x27;s not oily at all, no breakouts and it has actually faded my age spot areas on my forehead completely! You have no idea how long i&#x27;ve had to deal with these areas that I could never get rid of. After 1 month of once in the morning and once in the evening, my skin is now normal again!! All is I can say is try this and other products is all you can do to find the right one for you. This happen to be the one that worked for me after trying probably 5 others skin lightner creams. I know it does get expensive when you spend $35 on each one but it&#x27;s worth it once you find what works for you.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all I been using it, for a month no difference on the brown spots it all,</li>
    <li> I am on my third order of Pink Madison&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector.  I love this stuff.  It has taken a couple of orders to see results, but I&#x27;ve had my &amp;#34;imperfections&amp;#34; for a while.  Adding it to a good skin care regimen has improved the overall tone of my skin.  I didn&#x27;t notice, it was others telling me how good my skin looked and asked what I was doing differently.  This is the only thing I&#x27;ve changed!  It feels great, smells great, and a little goes a long way.  You only need a pea-sized drop for face, neck and chest. At least that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work  on my dark spot because after I&#x27;ve used it for  3 days my dark spot is somewhat lighter. I only use this in one  medium sized dark spot on my face not on the entire face as directed.  I&#x27;ll continue using this product and see how it goes.  So far so good!  I&#x27;ve used several dark spot correctors in the past and this works the best</li>
    <li> no change in my dark spots---just a greasy forehead after using it for 3 weeks---threw it out</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Does absolutely nothing that it claims it does. A totally useless product. Stay away.</li>
    <li> still waiting for results, nothing has happened yet</li>
    <li> After using this product for 2 weeks now I&#x27;ve noticed almost no change in the dark sun spots on my face.  I was hoping for better results.</li>
    <li> I will let you know after 2 or 3 weeks!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I haven´t seen any improvement until 2 weeks of using this product</li>
    <li> Aside from making my skin smooth, it really doesn&#x27;t have brightening effect</li>
    <li> Have been using this product religiously (twice/day per the instructions) since receiving it mid-May.  It has done nothing to reduce the pigment of the dark spot near my hair line.  Will continue to use, but according to most of the other reviews I read before purchasing people had begun to notice a difference a lot sooner.  The reason I am giving 4 stars, however, is because of the exceptional customer service I received after contacting the company re: a refund.  They are currently in the process of refunding my money and also recommended another product for me to try.  I will have no problem doing business with this company again in the future.</li>
    <li> The best dark spot corrector I have found so far! I was given this in return for reviewing it and I&#x27;m absolutely blown away by the quality !!</li>
    <li> Nothing to see here; buy a tube of something at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Still using it. It&#x27;s been three weeks, really do not see much change. I am hopeful. I will continue using this.</li>
    <li> I have been using PCA Pigment gel for a long time and decided to take a break from that brand and try something different. This product seems to also be lightening the brown hyperpigmentation spots but like the other product, takes time, and faithful application. This product is hard to rub in. Seems like I have to rub and rub and rub and it just sits on the top of my skin. Once I apply my moisturizer after it, it goes on in the skin. The dropper applicator is somewhat of a pain too. Doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the PCA Pigment gel. I would prefer a pump applicator.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely NOTHING. I used the entire bottle and it did absolutely nothing. $35 totally wasted. It&#x27;s my own fault. I should have known it was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> I have a few dark spots on my face, I started using the dark spot corrector about a week and a half ago, I’m starting to see a difference, the darkness is being reduced.  Everyone’s skin type is different and maybe the corrector may not cause miracles to happen but I sure am pleased with my results thus far, I’m hoping with continued use I will continue to see the spots diminish or at least lighten so much that they will not be visible to others.  Thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> My dark spots have truly begun to fade since I started using this product a few weeks ago. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Used the entire bottle. Not happy. Possibly this product works extremely slow.  Too slow for me</li>
    <li> Tried a lot of other spot correctors and this one is the best. I saw improvement within two weeks. Will definitely re-order    This is the best  product for improving dark spots!!!.</li>
    <li> When I was trying to put together my thoughts for a review of this product the only word that coming to mind was &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;.  The&lt;br /&gt;spots on my skin have faded a bit after several weeks but to call itself the best is a major stretch. I&#x27;m not impressed. I&#x27;ll finish&lt;br /&gt;out the bottle but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> SEEM TO BE WORKING, WORKS SLOW- 4-5 MONTHS/</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product but unfortunately it was not strong enough to completely get rid of all my dark spots. I figured I would do all the ladies here a favor and recommend Clear Skin cream for the ones that need something stronger. I got mine from royallashclub.com</li>
    <li> No changes after three weeks.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all. I bought this with my own money unlike most of the reviewers on here. Been using it almost two months twice a day and NO results.My dark spots aren&#x27;t even that severe still nothing. Def wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Only product that has worked for me. Give it a couple of weeks and you will start seeing results.</li>
    <li> Slowly the spots are disappearing on my face. I will monitor this product and give a second review&lt;br /&gt;once the whole bottle is finished. Thanks. VRLT.</li>
    <li> Been using for over a month and see no differnece at all</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I have been using it for about 2 months faithfully and have not noticed one single change. If you really, really want to get rid of dark age spots, I suggest you go to a qualified dermatologist who can do laser.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my sister and she says that it works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dark Spot Corrector for just over one month, and the bottle is almost empty. I only use it for some spots on one arm, plus a couple of areas on my face. I like the consistency of the product...the way it goes on, however once it has dried it leaves the area sticky which I don&#x27;t like. I also don&#x27;t like that for the relatively small areas I&#x27;m using it for, that the bottle is almost empty after about 40 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my headline indicated, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s REALLY working or not. This is the same problem I&#x27;ve had with other similar products that I&#x27;ve tried. After using it twice a day for 40 days...results, if any...are difficult to see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I&#x27;m starting to see subtle changes. Like with most beauty products, it takes time to see any significant difference. Now with that being said and taken the amount of time that I have been using this product, I can easily see that my skin tone is getting a bit lighter. My sun spots are still there but they don&#x27;t stand out as dark as they were a week or so ago. This is helping my skin tone even out so that I don&#x27;t have blotches of dark spots on my face. I can tell with further use that I will be able to see a more subtle appearance. I enjoy the consistency of this dark spot corrector. It&#x27;s a milky white looking substance and when applied, it leaves the skin feeling smooth and radiant. It&#x27;s not greasy so you don&#x27;t get an oily, shiny look. It says to use before moisturizer, but honestly I like using it by itself. I purchased this item on promo and have been very pleased with it thus far. I anticipate on using more products by this company. Hopefully, their other products are just as good, if not better than this dark spot corrector.</li>
    <li> Too soon to say if there&#x27;s a difference in the dark spots on my hands, but I am seeing a difference in softness. I like it so far!</li>
    <li> Just starting. Using it no results just yet.</li>
    <li> I have many sun spots and freckles on my face that I hide with makeup daily. They drive me nuts so I was excited to try this dark spot corrector. After two weeks I have noticed the dark spots on my forehead and cheeks have lightened a bit. It&#x27;s evened my skin tone out and it&#x27;s noticeable. The serum is lightweight, quickly absorbs into my skin, and had no side effects on my sensitive skin. Combining this with a daily facial SPF, I can tell my sun spots will be barely noticeable with regular use. Pink Madison- animal friendly, made in America, made in small batches for quality. This company truly cares about their customers.  *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> I was not sastified with the product however the makers of this product was very accomdating about how they could improve my experience so go ahead and try thid product it might work for you and you have nothing to loose by doing so</li>
    <li> I am seeing a slight lightening.  Haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to really evaluate.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I&#x27;ve spent soo much money over the years trying to find something to get rid of my dark spots! I have fair skin &amp; freckles, but the spots were more like blotches, and I felt like I could never leave the house without makeup! Well finally, I found this one, and it works!! You only have to use a little amount, so this small bottle goes a long way! Now I can just slip out to the market without makeup or feeling self conscience about my appearance! I will definitely be back for more! I highly recommend this dark spot corrector! Fast shipping! Great seller! Good price!</li>
    <li> I received this for review and testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way this formula smells very citrus like.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a week and no break outs what so ever. I have been applying it on some parts of my face where I have some brown spots. I do see a tiny bit of a difference but I would need to use it for at least 2 months or longer to see the actual results. But I will keep applying it as directed because I need my little spots gone.</li>
