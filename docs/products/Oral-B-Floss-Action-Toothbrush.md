<li> Other than  that it works just as expected.</li>
<li> brush is very hard and abrasive on my gums, had to change to sensitive.  </li>
<li> My previous toothbrush was an Oral B electric</li>
<li> 2500 and higher level models make you push the power button 2 or 3 times to cycle thru various cleaning modes, making them annoying to turn off.  </li>
<li> Takes up little space and cleans teeth thoroughly.  </li>
<li> This model has a very tiny base and really does the job.  </li>
<li> I have a very small sink area and wanted an electric toothbrush with a small foot print.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Oral-B</li>
<li> Wish I had bought one of these bad boys years ago.</li>

    <li> Love this.  Takes up little space and cleans teeth thoroughly.  A nice little cover just for the brush would have been a good addition.  I use a travel cover and place it on top.</li>
    <li> excellent product. makes brushing easy.</li>
    <li> This is a good toothbrush, but I don&#x27;t like the flashing red light that indicates that there is too much brushing pressure.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. This is my first electric toothbrush and I wish I would have bought on a longtime ago. Love the small round brush!</li>
    <li> xlnt product, really a step up from the previous Braun style model I owned.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does a perfect job...bristles hit every nook and cranny..the timer for each quadrant is a great addition..the light when using too much pressure is very helpful. my teeth feel soooo smooth and clean after each brushing.</li>
    <li> not sure this is worth price.  brush is very hard and abrasive on my gums, had to change to sensitive.  Bought to replace Braun, thinking that Braun is better product.</li>
    <li> I go fo 2 check ups/cleanings a year and my dentist comments on just how  clean my teeth are now, no bleeding gums or cavities after using for 6 months....bought one for each of adult children and they love it. I hope that the battery and charger last. Wish I had bought one of these bad boys years ago.</li>
    <li> Love these toothbrushes. Once you use an electric toothbrush, I do not think you ever go back to regular one.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.  I have used electric brushes for years and was surprised with the speed this one has.  I have braces and really am pleased with how well it cleans.</li>
    <li> Cant&#x27;s say I am a big fan of the red light to let you know you are brushing to hard... Kind of turns my bathroom into a disco. Other than  that it works just as expected.</li>
    <li> I have a very small sink area and wanted an electric toothbrush with a small foot print.  My previous toothbrush was an Oral B electric and I wanted to stay with them as I was very happy.  This model has a very tiny base and really does the job.  Love the 30 second notice for different quadrants of the mouth.  You can day dream while brushing and still get everything done!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Oral-B</li>
    <li> I have an older Oral B, this one is updated, works well, and the sensor for too much pressure is great.</li>
    <li> Great seller, love this item</li>
    <li> Braun Oral B 1500 / 1000 series offer the best deal, single push of the button to turn on/off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2500 and higher level models make you push the power button 2 or 3 times to cycle thru various cleaning modes, making them annoying to turn off.  If you want to adjust the cleaning mode, get a Philips model, it uses separate buttons for on/off and mode selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the Philips head smaller and easier to use, but if not handled carefully the end can vibrate against your teeth rattling bridgework.  Not totally safe.&lt;br /&gt;Braun Oral B rotating models don&#x27;t have this issue.  I haven&#x27;t tried, but I believe their cross-action model to be ok.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how tired my old electric toothbrush had gotten until I tried the new one.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel a thousand times cleaner than brushing with a regular brush.  The second speed is nice for kids.</li>
    <li> powerful. does the job.</li>
