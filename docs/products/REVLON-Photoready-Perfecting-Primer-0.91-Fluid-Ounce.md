<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ideal primer. Has a light odor that is somewhat medicinal. If the scent was improved, or even pleasant</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it everyday, usually just by it self. It works great, leaves my skin feeling softer then a baby&#x27;s bottom... Delivery was prompt and packaged very carefully. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased. Thanks so much!!!</li>
    <li> The product worked okay, and does what it says. (It &amp;#34;mattifies&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;mattes&amp;#34; your face in preparation for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, the pump broke. I hate pump dispensers for any/all cosmetic liquids for this very reason -- their tendency to break. What good is the greatest product if you can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle??</li>
    <li> I like this primer a lot- the only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that the packaging isn&#x27;t ideal.  It&#x27;s a pump, as opposed to a tube, so it&#x27;s very difficult to get all the product out.  It&#x27;s not just the dregs that are hard to get- once you are past the halfway mark, the pump doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well.  I&#x27;ve had to pry off the top to get in there and the top doesn&#x27;t go off and on very easily.  The product itself works well, but the packaging is frustrating enough that I&#x27;m shopping some other primers.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite primer and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. Minimizes pores, smooth&#x27;s out your skin and, is just a great starting place for a makeup routine. I do recommend buying Revlon ColorStay foundation because the two go absolutely beautifully together. Your face will look flawless.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice primer the only problem I had was that&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty small to me. But does help my makeup stay on especially when I pair it with a nice powder.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well!  I only wish that it had a different pump system because when it runs low you have to rip off the top in order to get to the (substantial amount) of primer that is left at the bottom of the container.</li>
    <li> A little bit of this product goes a long way so it&#x27;s really worth the buy. It&#x27;s very light and makes me feel like I&#x27;m wearing nothing at all. The shade is also perfect for my skin tone because it complements my foundation.</li>
    <li> I picked this up because the store did not have the other primer I was looking for.  I am so glad I tried it because I love it.  It really seems to smooth out the skin to prepare it for foundation.  It also seems to even out skin tone.  I would give it more stars if I could.  It&#x27;s a great price for such a great product.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of primers that were MUCH more expensive and I have to say this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is the first primer I have ever used and I LOVE IT. This product is very light when you apply and makes my skin feel like silk. awesome!</li>
    <li> I used this after my moisturizer and sunscreen, it didn&#x27;t ball up like most do! I needed a replacement for my Smashbox primer, which is amazing but way more expensive. It makes everything very soft and my Makeup Forever HD foundation stays put for much longer with this primer than without.</li>
    <li> This is day one wearing it, but I like it alot so far. If you have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use alot of the silicone based primers, give this one a try. My skin is still broken out after trying the Monistat anti- chafe gel as a primer (a horrible disaster, by the way- worst breakouts of my life), and I assumed I was one of these women who just can&#x27;t wear primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product feels more like a lightweight moisturizer than a silicone- heavy gel. The pump is handy and sanitary and the packaging looks more high end than your basic drugstore cosmetic wares. It goes on smooth, blends easily, and smooths and mattifies skin. Foundation glides right over it, and the finish is flawlessly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on my makeup at 6 am and work 9- 12 hr days. By the end of the day, my makeup is still fresh- although I do blot oil a couple times a day with blotting papers and reapply powder on my oiliest areas. But...it really helps keep the foundation &amp; powder in place. And for the price and amount of product you get, it really is economical, especially if you use Smashbox primer or another high end product.</li>
    <li> I love this primer simply because it makes my face look beautiful. It&#x27;s the perfect complement to my Photoready Airbrush foundation. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to not only be useless but also sabotage my foundation. I wish I had bought it at Rite Aid so I could return it since they have such a great makeup return policy. Super disappointed especially because I heard great things about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several primers and this is my favorite. Takes the shine off, smooths out tiny lines and does a decent job with hiding small pours. It evens out my skin tone and many days I just wear this with a little blush and mascara. I put in on after moisturizing with a high end moisturizer on my 66 year old skin.</li>
    <li> Worst part is the packaging. You can see that there is a lot of product left but can&#x27;t get to it because of the pump mechanism. I pried the top off and have been trying to get the rest out with cotton swabs. If it was just a little, I wouldn&#x27;t bother. But there is a lot left!</li>
    <li> When compairing face primers, I search for quality and price. I originally purchased the Revlon Photoready Perfecting Primer from a local Rite Aide on sale. I tried it, it has a light hint of color that blends into your skin, once it is evenly applied. I am light skinned, so it blended very well, giving a natural look. I used Revlon Mineral loose powder over the primer and it gave me a very beautiful and flawless finish. I used Revlon products, because it does what the product indicates, However if you have a different brand it may work just as well with the Revlon Photoready Perfecting Primer. Keep in mind, this review is based on my personal experience i have had with this particular product! Everyones skin type is different, and what works well for one, may not be the same for someone else. Overall, I would recommed this product to anyone because it holds true to what it says it can do. It gives that flawless and photoready look that most women want. It is inexensive on Amazon, so you can&#x27;t go wrong. Compaired to higher end face primers on the market, it&#x27;s a great value and great results.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing</li>
    <li> Provides a smooth base for my foundation.  Does not feel sticky or greasy.  Make-up stays in place much longer than without primer.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled. It&#x27;s thinner than the Smashbox primer I liked but I didn&#x27;t wanna pay $40 so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a shot.</li>
    <li> great product as all revlon products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this product. I put on my face, then sat at my desk for about an hour working before returning to put on makeup. The product had began to ball up &amp; flake off--weirdest thing that I&#x27;ve never seen with a lotion or primer!</li>
    <li> This primer will make a big difference in your complexion. Make up goes on smoother and seems to stay bright and fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I am used to using Arbonne makeup primer, which I LOVE, but didn&#x27;t see the practicality of spending $60 on such a tiny quantity all the time. I searched around for highly rated, less expensive primers and came upon this. It works well, but I feel like the Arbonne stuff kept my skin clearer (I am prone to acne). I also have combination skin on the oilier side, so for me, this stuff doesn&#x27;t keep my face from getting shiny at the end of the day (nothing some powder makeup can&#x27;t fix). I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> i hav to say aft its use i felt my skin looked more poreless and matte texture almost all day long.. one thing i hate is, it kinda settle down if u don spread on ur face as soon as u apply.. otherwise i love love love this product... even my mom loved it .. wud purchase again..</li>
    <li> The best primer I have used! Highly recommend it if you want a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> I am unable to use Cover Girl products any place near my eyes.  It&#x27;s me and not the product.  I had the same reaction of watering eyes, redness in the eyes, and burning eyes with this product.  If you are like me and your skin is sensitive to Cover Girl products, don&#x27;t buy this.  Within 20 minutes I had a problem and had to wash my face.  This did not influence the review because my reaction is within myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product felt greasy going on the face.  I am well over 60 and classify my skin as dry.  I allowed my face to dry thinking maybe I applied too much.  After a short period of time, I felt it was not being absorbed in my skin.  When I ordered this, I also ordered Instant Age Rewind by Maybelline.  Maybelline, by far for a very similar product, is superior to this Revlon version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ok rating is for the product and no my reaction to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. I have very sensitive skin and did not irritate whatsoever:)</li>
    <li> I hate to admit that I sweat profusely. This product does not help. I guess I should have known better and just be resigned to reapplying my makeup throughout the day.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great primer.  Often, I use it alone without any foundation or powder because it leaves my skin looking so smooth and even.  Best of all, it saves me lots of $$$ because using this as a primer, I can spend less money on pigmented products like eyeshadows and blushes because there&#x27;s no longer any need for the ultra-high-end products.  The less expensive pigmented products look fantastic as long as this is applied underneath.</li>
    <li> This primer is average. It helps control oil but it makes my makeup a little chalky. It&#x27;s worth a try but it takes trial and error to get it right for you.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my skin and the price for this is awesome! Most primers are super expensive and only have a little amount of product but this is cheap and has so much product. Really loving this thing :)</li>
    <li> very waxy and hard to wash off, felt like i was just covering my face in wax, perfect for you if that is what you&#x27;re looking for</li>
    <li> didnt keep wearing it. does get cakey</li>
    <li> I love this primer. I have no idea why Revlon decided to go and ruin their photo ready foundation to the airbrush effect formula. Most primers are silicone based which do not work well for oily skin. This one is slightly sticky in a good way and almost feels like it is filling in the potholes aka pores on your face. Even wearing this alone your skin&#x27;s appearance will improve. It helps foundation glide on smoother. I would say you can use any foundation with this product. The bottle lasts relatively long. Makeup does wear better with this on throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This primer is a great affordable addition to any makeup collection. This primer helps makeup to last longer and creates a flawless airbrush-like finish. A key thing to keep in mind is to only apply a thin layer since a little goes a long way. Applying too much caused my foundation to be practically impossible to blend (I use this w/ the Revlon ColorStay foundation). Also, this primer doesn&#x27;t necessarily fill in pores if that&#x27;s what you were in the market for.</li>
    <li> This was the first primer I ever used and it gave me a great base for my foundation. I have a very ruddy complexion and it helped my skin look completely flawless. When I ran out, I decided to try a more expensive primer and it doesn&#x27;t work at all! I am definitely going back to my Revlon Photoready. Stick with what works!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work with my other face products, no matter how long I let it settle on my face still smeared weird when I put on concealer and powder. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work with my makeup</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything for you. It&#x27;s an expensive face lotion.</li>
    <li> Twice I have bought this product and while I like the results, the dispenser stops working when the product still is half full! I had to pry the top off with a knife to get more product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy this brand again.  Will find one with a better pump or one in an open jar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to makeup and after watching a lot of youtube videos thought I should get a primer! This one is not expensive, does not have a smell, or leaves a diff. color on the face. It blends very well, does not leave the skin oily, and feels silky. My makeup lasted all day, and I think the primer along with using a flat top kabuki brush that I just got helped spread everything evenly. I was using the flat foundation brush but the &amp;#34;painting&amp;#34; style I think made me a little cakey. This primer made everything smooth. So far I love it!</li>
    <li> My first makeup primer and I&#x27;m disappointed. It went on smooth but my makeup went on awful afterward. It made my face look very Cake-y and not natural. I normally just apply lotion or moisterizer before makeup and it looks much better.</li>
    <li> this is the best primer I have come across and the price is nice</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all, you&#x27;re better off using Almay line smoothing makeup; I thought it had more of a tight smooth effect.</li>
    <li> Nothing ever seems to take away the dark circles and give me a bit of luminescence under my eyes. This did the trick. without the super high price.</li>
    <li> I bought this primer and initially loved it. It feels really soft and matte on your face as soon as you put it on and I feel like it evened out my skin a bit too. But once I put my foundation over it, after an hour or two my makeup started caking really bad and settling into my creases and pores. While I like the feel of it on its own, I would not recommend this as a primer under any makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this product- goes on smooth not too oily or thick  like other primers I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I have used this now for a couple of months under my foundation and I love the feel of it and how it helps blend everything together so well.</li>
    <li> great product, smooth coverage, provides easy makeup application..Would recommend this product to anyone with fine lines, age spots for great makeup coverage.</li>
    <li> This is the third primer I have tried and I will never use anything else. The price is so great too! It&#x27;s super light and blends in easily.</li>
    <li> Beats smashbox and every other primer I&#x27;ve used. Goes on smooth, smells good, non-greasy, fills in pores, holds my makeup in place.</li>
    <li> amazing, use in clean skin as suggested, gives me a sleek and silky feeling in my skin. you dont feel it like a foundation or sticky cream which is annoying when u still have foundations and some powder to apply.</li>
    <li> I have only ever used Philosophy&#x27;s brand called &amp;#34;The Present&amp;#34; and was nervous to try this drug store brand.  It is exactly the same product as the much more expensive brand by Philosophy...for a full $10 less.  Your skin looks flawless with this primer underneath your foundation or alone.  It gives your skin an airbrushed look and is completely weightless.</li>
    <li> I like this primer, it does keep my foundation on longer. Apply a light layer on after your skin care routine. Make sure that all your moisturizer had absorbed, apply, and then apply your foundation ect.  I doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or cakey as long as you are not using too much. More is not better in this case. The price point is fantastic, for the amout you are getting. I have purchased primer is the past, and it was a significantly smaller amout for about the same money, maybe even more.</li>
    <li> The primer itself is wonderful. I was very pleased with the coverage. However, about 3/4 of the way through the bottle, the pump quit working and I&#x27;m unable to use the remainder of it.</li>
    <li> Its awesome but after the fourth day I used it, it was empty. ok.</li>
    <li> I no longer use foundation. Just the primer and loose powder. Love this product.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last long I work for about 7 hours a day . not much of a primer for a busy day</li>
    <li> Love the product, but when it&#x27;s about 3/4ths gone the pump is too short to reach the product.  Very frustrating not being able to access the remainder of the product.  Top won&#x27;t screw off to allow easier access.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for very long but I&#x27;ve made some observations already. I like the consistency of the product, but I don&#x27;t see any real difference when using this with makeup vs makeup without it. It does tend to feel thick when I blend my liquid foundation over the top of it making my makeup feel heavy initially (and I don&#x27;t use much). It actually seems as though my makeup settles into my fine lines more so when I use this, so I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ll keep using it because it was not so cheap but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> I quite liked my first application of this product.  It should have been a little creamier and easier to apply, but the overall result was reasonably good.  However, after a couple of hours of wearing, it started to flake off and looked like dandruff on my black top.  Don&#x27;t bother with this!</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin feeling great- it&#x27;s the perfect light weight primer to wear under makeup. Very satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> works well with either a mineral makeup or cream foundation</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, was using ARBONNE  face primer, read about this primer in O magazine.  Bought mine from walmart, a bought the same price.  I am 54 have combination skin with some scaring from acne and showing some damage from sun exposure.  I exfoliate in morning use a serum then add my new perfecting primer, add very little light foundation.  This keeps my makeup as nice by late afternoon as it was when I applied it.  And at 54 the less you have to put powder on your face to reduce shine the better, fine lines can find any reason to show.  SO not having to re apply anything is fantastic. And it is hot in IL. Great product for 10 dollars and if you have a clear complexion, you can just use this and skip foundation.  I use a cheap foundation Nude brand so it&#x27;s not the expensive foundation that makes it work.</li>
    <li> Was ok, I thought it made my face look pale pink when I got photos back... Otherwise it was an ok primer.</li>
    <li> I use it because of how well it works, BUT wish they had listed ingredients on the bottle. No mention of anything, not sure why but it probably is not a good sign.</li>
    <li> I can see absolutely no improvement to the appearance of  my face using this product either by itself or under foundation.</li>
    <li> I have used many other Revlon Photoready products and loved them. I was trying to swap out some of my products for ones with better ratings on the EWG Skin Deep database, but which didn&#x27;t break the bank. This definitely does the trick! I have fairly oily skin and this helps my makeup stay in place longer and keeps my skin from becoming oily. it has almost no smell whatsoever and is lightweight, but not watery or thin feeling. It&#x27;s a great value!</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers I was hoping it would would work out. Just wanted something to keep my face matte since I don&#x27;t wear make up and it tends to get shiny.&lt;br /&gt;My face broke out almost immediately. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I was mortified not being able to cover it up. I think it may be old or something. Don&#x27;t know much about makeup to say that it is.&lt;br /&gt;A loss for me!</li>
    <li> As an author who is constantly getting her photo taken, this is a must.  It perfects my skin and makes for a lot better photos than without it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m a Sephora junkie!  So when I read that this Primer can hold it&#x27;s own against Smashbox, or other brand name products, I was skeptical.  However, now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I&#x27;m hooked!  I&#x27;ll still stick to Sephora for other things, but I think I&#x27;ve found my Primer!  It doesn&#x27;t sit in fine lines like others I&#x27;ve tried, and it makes you look awesome in photos!</li>
    <li> I expected this &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; to fill the pores as suggested it would do to create a smooth, air-brush look when used with  the accompaning makeup.  It didn&#x27;t do as expected but I do like the &amp;#34;natural beige&amp;#34; color of the makeup.  I don&#x27;t think this primer is necessary to be used under the makeup.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again but I will purchase the natural beige color makeup.</li>
    <li> Run and buy this primer! I brought this Primer because oh it&#x27;s reviews. I have to say since day one it worked miracles. Living in a tropical Island and working near a beach, my makeup will always melt on my face. And let&#x27;s not talk about feeling and looking oily. It felt so good when I first tried it, my skin looked beautiful and I was amazed I did not have to touch up with powder during the morning (I usually have to put on some powder at least 2-4 times a day).  I will definitely keep buying this. No need to look for another primer anymore! :-)</li>
    <li> This is a bad primer. I don&#x27;t know if I got an old product, but when I used it, the liquid clumped all over my face. It looks like a coagulated mess on my face. I would go elsewhere for a primer.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well for me! I have acne, and this stuff did not clog my pores or worsen breakouts. I absolutely love this stuff. It keeps my makeup fresh for hours and mattifies the oily spots. All I have to do is put a little loose powder on my face every few hours to minimize oil. It comes off easily with makeup removing pads, and it doesn&#x27;t feel cakey like other primers. I love3 it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what I expected but it makes my skin drier.  Gave up quickly - will try again when it&#x27;s not so hot!</li>
    <li> It drys the skin, makes it uneven and when you apply foundation on top of it,  it looks patchy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but the product that was sent to me was not packaged well so the bottle broke with content spillage. I really needed the primer for an event so I had to manage it without returning.</li>
    <li> I love this primer. Have used others that did not last all day. Has highlights that cover up dark spots.Moist but not oily.</li>
    <li> With acne-prone skin, I have to wash my face thoroughly with a facial cleanser every morning, leaving a shine on my face. In addition, I have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, I would wash my face, moisturize my skin (letting it soak it), then putting on the primer. I also recommend buying the BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not necessary to use too much of it, just in the areas you get shiny the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks healthy, and pretty with the use of this primer. It gave me a great confidence boost!</li>
    <li> It does make face feel soft but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t fit into my makeup routine, I could pretty much do without this because it doesn&#x27;t make a difference, whether I have on just foundation alone or this primer and foundation, I don&#x27;t see a difference at all so I could do without.....it&#x27;s not all that amazing as everyone is making it to be and I don&#x27;t see the hype..... By the way I didn&#x27;t buy this on here,this was just my opinion from buying it from my local store</li>
    <li> Dunno why everyone is rejoicing over this product...it literally crumbles when I rub it on my face , and that&#x27;s without adding any powder or cover up! Not sure if my skin is just weird or if this is just a flawed mix!</li>
    <li> Very matte. Making me break out.</li>
    <li> I use this after moisturizer (I use Olay Professional Pro-X Age Repair Lotion With Sunscreen) and sometimes nothing else as this does smooth out unevenness in skin tone slightly.  It is not a cover stick so don&#x27;t expect it to cover everything, but does even the tone out a little and I also like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I wear it over my sun screen to the gym, Etc.  I use color science SPF 50 as my powder .No base or  foundation just beautiful skin with a luminous glow.</li>
    <li> Feels very similar to smash box primer and fills in those little wrinkles.  Also makes my skin feel great and makeup go on a lot smoother.  I also notice myself needing less foundation with this product.  1-2pumps is all you need for your whole face.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  It is not oily; it feels powdery and feather like.  Glad I found this one.</li>
    <li> It worked fine, wasn&#x27;t the worst thing and it did have a long lasting makeup effect. Although, after a couple days of using this product my entire face broke out and i had a severe allergic reaction to it. This has never happened to me with makeup before and i was shocked. It took weeks for it to heal and i could not wear makeup for that time.</li>
    <li> Does not really make my foundation stay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty neutral about this product because although it didn&#x27;t work very well for me I feel like it could be amazing for other people. So I have oily skin and I like to use pretty heavy full coverage foundations. But when I wear this under those foundation my makeup tends to slide off which doesn&#x27;t usually happen unless I&#x27;m sweating a lot. I tried this product in the summer time but I think it could do better for me in the winter. I&#x27;d recommend trying this if you have dry or normal skin.</li>
    <li> This little bottle will last you a life time it&#x27;s consistency and quality is something out a beauty salon</li>
    <li> best primer ever. i do not want stop using,i just love the feel in my skin, its is bazinga. ha ha ha</li>
    <li> This is truly a well worth product to buy. I have recently tried Laura Mercier primer and was not impressed at all. Revel on primer tightens my pores and evens out the skin tone. Amazing product</li>
    <li> I like this product and find it is perfect not only as a primer, but as my foundation as well.  It applies smoothly on my maturing skin and I don&#x27;t need a bunch for even coverage.  It doesn&#x27;t settle in the fine lines, and actually lightens them to be much less noticeable.  It brightens my complexion, evens out the tones, and gives me a nice, healthful looking skin.  I simply add a bit of bronzing powder for a sun-kissed look, blend well, apply mascara, and a light dab of lip color and I am ready for the day.  It has good staying power and I have yet to feel or see the need to touch up during the day.</li>
    <li> Works great! I was matte all day. Even took a nap and still woke up with my makeup looking good with only minimal to no shine on my nose. My skin is dark brown (black) and naturally moderately oily. I would recommend to a friend and I would buy again. The only minor con is it doesn&#x27;t have a particularly pleasant smell, but the chemical-like smell is mild and is gone 2 minutes after application.</li>
    <li> I have issues with oily skin. Putting this on under my makeup definitely has helped my afternoon sheen. This is something I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> It is alright it does it&#x27;s job but, I want to try a different brand next time to see if it works better.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at target for about the same amount but I got to physically have it sooner. Wow, this is amazing! I have oily skin...like really  oily...like if it could be produced into gas I would be set for life! Its always been difficult finding products that wouldn&#x27;t make me look horrible after and hour. Ive been through a few primers and a lot of powders but I always needed to blot my face from time to time which would affect my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews about this and was skeptical about it working but I bit the bullet and gave it a try...Amazing feels like an understatement. Hours pass, I sweat, more hours pass and when I get home my face has more of a dewy glow than someone threw a bucket of grease on me...amazing</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it makes my make-up look flawless.  I LOVE it!  I wash my face, use a little toner, moisturizer and then I put this on before my foundation.  It really is wonderful and worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that some reviews are complaining of it not going on smoothly.  I don&#x27;t have this problem, but I always ensure my moisturizer is completely dry before I use this primer and I use Colorstay creme foundation with it.</li>
    <li> I put this on, and then the makeup an it looks horrible. What a waste of my money! Wish I had not ever bought it.</li>
    <li> good coverage, nice matte finish.</li>
    <li> Love the silkiness of this primer. Makes my makeup stay on longer and I love the smell!</li>
    <li> Good glow, doesn&#x27;t cover up pores very well. Does make it less noticeable. Not too greasy, though at the end of the day I do have oil on my face(i have very very oily skin).  Smells okay, packaging perfect(there&#x27;s a glass bottle). Completely fits my skin color.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders.  I have decent skin so I don&#x27;t really need foundation, but I need a little bit of evening-out; this does that, more quickly and with less mess than a BB cream.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was as good as expected. SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I have noticed a big difference in how long my foundation stays &amp; the smoothness of it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is getting all of it out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from a drug store, but wanted to leave a review here for others. This product is AMAZING! I am prone to breakouts so a lot of makeup or liquid foundation is a no go for me. I only use a concealer for under eyes, and powder foundation. I purchased this after reading Amazon reviews to see how well it would work under just my powder foundation. Wow what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;My makeup was always non existent by noon daily and the oily prone areas were  an oil slick. Constant re touching was needed. After using this primer for 2 weeks, it extends a powder foundation to an all day affair. No touch ups, NO oil slicks all day. I&#x27;m impressed and will never stop using this primer. People have commented on how &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; I look! Great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too shimmery for me as a primer and doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; in like I had hoped. It&#x27;s more of a shimmery lotion than what I consider to be a primer.</li>
    <li> works great and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this prime. It looks super great. I&#x27;m glad I perched it.</li>
    <li> Not to thick and easy to spread. I don&#x27;t really notice it controlling my oils though, but I still love it.</li>
    <li> This primer creates the most awful texture when smoothed onto the skin. It ENLARGED my pores and just gave my skin a dead, awfully-textured finish.&lt;br /&gt;Wore it for a full day to class from 8am-5pm and by 9am the primer had separated itself from my skin and it literally looked like it was floating on top of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I sweat walking to class and have very oily skin to begin with so it should have softened up little bit after an hour or so, but no- it got worse and worse. Not to mention, the quality and price don&#x27;t match up. It is anywhere from $10-$14 depending on where you get it from (almost as much as a decent brand name primer) and has the worst quality I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll go ahead and say that I&#x27;m a huge fan of pump bottles. You can get just the right amount so easily without a big mess. I have oily and acne prone skin that is absolutely a nightmare during the summer months. Let me tell you, a little goes a long way! This primer made my skin matte and very soft and my foundation stayed in place all day. I did have to use oil blotting wipes once after about 4 hours, which is an improvement from the 2 hours I could go before. Take into account also that it is summer and I live in a very humid area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my other two experiences with primers (Rimmel and Almay) I was afraid to try again. Both quite literally burned my face and broke me out through irritation. The third try is the charm, here!</li>
    <li> Love this primer, perfect for your face, minimize pores excellent, but i dont like the smell too much.</li>
    <li> Love it! Cuts the shine on face!</li>
    <li> Love this!  I have tried several primers including some of the more expensive ones but this one works the best for me.  It brightens my skin and it&#x27;s not too thick.  The Revlon color correcting primer was too pink for me but this one is perfect.</li>
    <li> received it on time, tried the next day, I really liked it. Went on very smooth, it did not look caked on. Although I would recommend to wearing a foundation as this product did seem to turn my face white, and I did not put a lot on, very light coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different primers for my face and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used so far. Long lasting, not sticky, not oily, bonds with my makeup and hydrates my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge makeup person, so this review might be useless to some. However, the main reason I don&#x27;t use it is because I&#x27;m out in the sun all day and it would just leave a mess. Using this helped a LOT. Getting the right amount was the only tricky part of the whole thing. It was very lightweight and useful for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> Maybe I need to get better foundation, but I didn&#x27;t really notice anything wonderful or out of this world. Maybe its because I have extremely dry skin, even though I moisturize all day! I will have to try it with another foundation to see.</li>
    <li> I have tried several primers and loved one I can no longer get due to high price and so searched on here for one to take its place.  I work part time and can&#x27;t afford some of the more expensive brands, so I ran across this and decided to give it  a try and have to say I am happy I did.  I have been using it for about two weeks and while the weather is still cool, this primer has kept my makeup intact all day. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, just a little goes a long way.  It does not feel greasy so far, although again, the weather is still fairly cool.  My job makes me sweat however, but even so, my makeup stays on well and I have to blot my face a lot less than I did when I used other brands.  My face is dry in winter but this does not make it worse, and it gets somewhat oily in the summer, which I have yet to try.  Thus far I am pleased with this product and will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> Ideal primer.  Has a light odor that is somewhat medicinal.  If the scent was improved, or even pleasant, it would be &amp;#34;perfecto&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This primer is very good. I love how it feels when you apply to your face by itself it feels so smooth. I had medium/tan skin and it worked very well. I applied some on my sister and she loved it too.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover my dark spots. I&#x27;m not too happy with this product. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product before and I love it. It is a good product to buy and good cost too.</li>
    <li> I like this one better than the other Revlon color ready.  It takes the sheen off and holds the make-up in place.  At times I use only this and a bb cream for under my eyes and I can go out the door.</li>
    <li> excellent product and 100% reliable</li>
    <li> I purchased Revlon Photoready Perfecting Primer at my local drugstore.  It settled into my pores and became cakey on my skin.  When I tried to put on my foundation, it rolled up like dead skin.  It took a facial scrub (and I mean REALLY scrub)to get it off my face.  I stared over, and waited a little longer before I tried my foundation, with the same results.  After several tries over a couple of weeks, I realize it is not the product for me.  Even if it looked nice or helped my foundation look smoother, it is so hard to remove, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to use it.  Do you remember using paste in first grade, the kind you spread on with a plastic stick attached to the lid?  That&#x27;s what this Revlon Primer felt like on my face, and that&#x27;s what it looked like when it rolled up on my skin... paste.  It cost about $11, and I really wish I had shopped more wisely and read some reviews before I wasted that money.  I am 51, fair skinned, very light wrinkling (crows feet), minor crepe-like texture in the jowl area, but over all good skin for my age and no issues with dry skin or acne.  If you have similar skin, you may want to try something else.  Hopefully this will help someone, and if anyone has successfully used this product, I&#x27;d love to hear your application method.  Maybe I am doing something wrong. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this product, provides a fantastic base for makeup</li>
    <li> I was never a fan of Revlon products (especially their lipsticks. sorry) until I discovered this wonderful primer! It really erases my pores and makes it perfect and so ready to made up! And once I apply my make up, I always finish with a dreamy, glowing, almost perfect face! I love it!</li>
    <li> Affordable and great stuff. Good coverage for sure.</li>
    <li> Definitely creates a great face to start from.  Makeup goes on smoother and eyeshadow does not crease or fade off during the day.</li>
    <li> I have used Hard Candy primer from Walmart for a year or 2 now; the only primer I have ever tried.  I really liked Hard Candy as it allowed my liquid foundation to slide on effortlessly and stay pretty good. It seemed to me lately that the HC primer was drying out in the squeeze tube container, so I thought I would step up my game a bit.  I chose Revlon @ about $10.  Not a good choice:  It leaves the surface of my face dry and makes it very difficult to apply my foundation evenly. So, so disappointing.  I think I will do some research and try another brand.  I can see that a primer can really make a difference in my makeup routine.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best primer I have ever tried.  It smothers your skin in an amazing way. It completely diminish the look of big porous.  It&#x27;s better than a lot of other expensive primer at there.&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of this product now and is so inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;You use only a tiny bit at the time.</li>
    <li> For special occasions.  Works good.</li>
    <li> it just felt weird on my face and the feeling never went away...</li>
    <li> i was hesitant to try this because of the extra price to add to a makeup routine, but this is SO worth it. it makes skin tone even and hides blemishes before applying foundation even. it covers scars and creates a smooth surface for foundation and powder, so it looks flawless.</li>
    <li> This is a steal of a deal. I like it a bit better than the Bare Minerals primer. This feels like a cream at first, then turns into super soft primer. You do need to let it dry for a bit longer, though...otherwise it feels a bit greasy,</li>
    <li> This primer is really smooth and lightweight. It makes my skin very even and when I put on foundation, the bumps and unevenness from blemishes and scarring literally disappear! I love this stuff</li>
    <li> I like how it works, goes on smooth and holds my make up well. Smells kind of funny but its not bad.</li>
    <li> its light, not sure what its purpose really is???</li>
    <li> Goes on very smoothly....not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> It is a good product and I really like it. Thanks for all the things you have for me, because I really appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable, first time user, will keep this in my makeup bag always.  Great lid with pump so very little is used each application.</li>
    <li> Works covering up everything, but then my face started breaking out, so only use for very special occasions and clean it off quickly after.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend uses this and REVLON color correcting primer. Seems very similar, and works great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING.  I can put this on over my moisturizer (let that dry) then put this on (then let it dry) and then put on my foundation.  And when I walk out into Phoenix summer heat of 113° my make-up does not sweat off.  No, not even when I have to wipe the sweat off.  I look bad without makeup.  I&#x27;ve got very red skin, so going out in the heat makes the whole situation worse for me.  But I discovered this years ago.  And you only need a very little bit at a time for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t agree that my skin looks better or anything.  It makes my skin look a bit matte and dull (a bit, nothing horrible) but I use a shimmered highlighter to cancel out the lifeless skin.  Then I look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> not a fan of the finish this leaves on my skin</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  My daughter and I have different skin tones.  She is very light (think Twilight Vampires) and I am a medium beige .  This product works with both our skin tones and feels great.</li>
    <li> Amazing for be drugstore one of my favorites and I&#x27;m oily skin</li>
    <li> I love all the Revlon Photoready products and this product is one of my favorites. It smooth&#x27;s out all wrinkles and blemishes and makes my foundation appear flawless. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love this primer. My eyeshadow stays on all day long and it creates a beautiful canvas for my eyelids so I smooth and easy application can occur. I love revlon</li>
    <li> This is a great primer for my acne prone and sensitive skin. It glides on so smooth, and makes makeup apply and blend in beautifully. It also does a great job of brightening and evening my complexion.</li>
    <li> i have dry skin and this is the only primer that doesn&#x27;t  make my skin look flakey. it keeps my makeup looking matte, and it feels great on the skin. the second it goes on you can see a difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new user of the Photoready Foundation (once a Colorstay girl). For years ive battled sweating off my makeup in the hot summers so I looked into what I needed, a primer. Reading up on reviews and looking at prices I decided to try the Perfecting Primer over the Color Correcting Primer... it was worth the buy! Now I&#x27;m only on day two of usage but I&#x27;ve already notice a difference! My foundation holds longer than it ever has and keeps my makeup even. My upper lip always seemed to be the first thing to dew up in the heat and as a result my makeup used to come off... keywords are USED TO! LOVE LOVE LOVE the perfecting primer, even when I sweat now my foundation holds just as it was when I first applied it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before my purchase I read others battled a peeling problem, I noticed this when I applied the first day but on my second I tried to use less product and my result was perfect! I highly recommend this primer AND it&#x27;s at a great price!</li>
    <li> I got this primer because I&#x27;ve heard great things about the Revlon Photoready line, and like the translucent finishing powder. This however, was an extreme disappointment. It did feel really nice going on, and my foundation applied smoothly over it, BUT (and this is a big but), it made my foundation oxidize after only a few hours! My face looked greasy and orange, and the only thing I had changed about my routine was the primer I used. I am extremely disappointed with this primer, and will NOT be using or purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I would give this primer 10 stars if I could. This is the first primer I have ever used and I LOVE IT. I have oily brown skin( I am from Brazil) and one thing I was always very disappointed about makeup is that it would ALWAYS melt on my eye lids withing less than 1 hour. I started using waterproof eye liner to try to have it last a little longer with not much success. So I decided to try a primer and I just didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for it and purchased the REVLON at a drugstore. WHAT A SUCCESS!!!! BINGO! My make up lasts over 12 hours a day. I am not kidding.I am not doing anything different except for using this primer on my face. After 12 hours my entire face looks just as good as when I first applied the makeup. I use the cheapest makeup form drugstores I can find and it will still be amazing after all day wearing it. I even use regular eyeliner and it will be just perfect! This product is very very light when you apply and makes my skin feel like silk. Just awesome!Thank you REVLON</li>
    <li> Went on nicely but made me breakout so badly the first day I used it. Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful primer that goes on smooth and helps keep makeup looking fresh throughout the day. A little bit of this product goes a long way in keeping skin looking great.</li>
    <li> This is my first primer. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily after applying this primer. It evens my skin tone very well. So far so good !</li>
    <li> this stuff makes my makeup look soo much smoother and completes it with a nicer look. (: it works wonders and I would definitely recommend it. I will continuing purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Smashbox Primer for many years, but because of the cost I don&#x27;t use it daily. I&#x27;ve tried other primers that just weren&#x27;t worth buying at all. I purchased this because of the good reviews. This Revlon product is less than half the cost and while it is not that sulking, baby soft feel you get from Smashbox......the Revlon product is a reasonable substitute and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> liked the product, the brand Revlon is not coming to Venezuela by the situation of the country. But if I recommend it very good</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE MUY RESPONSABLES</li>
    <li> makes you one shade lighter than you really are but does what it says it does,</li>
    <li> I have a problem with foundation melting off in the summer, this product kept my face fresh for over 12 hours in the summer heat. I likey!</li>
    <li> I really like this primer. This is the first primer I&#x27;ve ever used and was concerned I may have gotten the wrong shade but shade does NOT matter with this stuff. It blurs your skin to the point you may decide you don&#x27;t even need the cover up and it works for eye lids too so your eye shadow lasts all day long. Just don&#x27;t get it in your mouth it tastes awful, lol!!</li>
    <li> To thin. Like water no coverage.</li>
    <li> Another Revlon product that I very much love. I love Revlon products and this one is another great product at an affordable price, as usual. It leaves my skin smooth and it does indeed help my makeup last longer and look prettier. It might be a bit too drying for those with dry skin, which is not my case and therefore this product is perfect for me and is my favorite alternative to the more expensive high end brands.</li>
    <li> Well I give it zero stars... But it didn&#x27;t let me... It was old  when I got it... It was probably sitting on there shelf for years... I just thru It away...</li>
    <li> Works good, good coverage.  Would order again. Good product, would recommend to friends.  Not as smooth as others I have used</li>
    <li> Thought I would give it a try... but it did not work so well with my mineral makeup. Emphasized my pores, my makeup was spotchy, and after 3 days wearing it I got big breakouts. I will just spend the $50 for the Hourglass Primer...</li>
    <li> leaves a little bit of a whitish sheen so my skin looks much more pale.  but when i apply makeup on top it&#x27;s ok, just still a bit more pale than typical</li>
    <li> Love this product. One and half pump is actually enough for my whole face. It does not fill in pores as it claims but it does give you a glowing, silky, perfect skin tone ready for any make up. I don&#x27;t use foundation when I apply this primer. There is no need. Apply with a brush for smoother finish and you will use less as well.</li>
    <li> There is some issue with it bothering my cheeks, stings a bit. The color is nice but I&#x27;d have preferred clear.</li>
    <li> This primer didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.  It actually made my make-up look worse in the afternoon - it made it separate more.  I&#x27;ll stick to the Smashbox photo finish primer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!! It&#x27;s lightweight, it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and cause me to get breakouts, and it makes my foundation look FLAWLESS! The other great thing is that I never have to touch up my foundation (Revlon ColorStay) throughout the day because it seems to make the foundation stay put. I have dark spots and pimple scars on my face but with the combination of this primer and my foundation, it looks like I have a flawless complexion.  In the past just using foundation alone (even w/concealers), you could still see some of my dark spots beneath.  Will DEFINITELY purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> This is the best primer ever.  It fills in my pores like I wanted other primers to do and never lived up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Revlon another winner!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time.  It works better than the last primer I purchased.  So far no problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using Smashbox primer for several years however like everything else it keeps getting more expensive every time I buy it. Because of that I have been trying other primers in an effort to find one that is less expensive but still works well. This is the 3rd primer I have tried and it is absolutely the worst one so far that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on in the mornings my skin isn&#x27;t silky and smooth like it is with most primers. Instead it makes my skin dry and my  makeup  settles into fine lines and wrinkles by lunchtime. By the end of the day my makeup looks horrible and I can&#x27;t get it off fast enough. I have been using it for a little over a week to make sure I wasn&#x27;t being overly critical however after today I am throwing it away and will never purchase another bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this primer, and it does what it says, and meant to do.  I get an overall, slightly pink, think youthful, matte base.  Indeed, imperfections are erased and your skin looking flawless.  I use a loose mineral foundation, regular baked blush, and a mineral finishing powder.  I spray mineral water on my face to set my makeup, and I end up with a gorgeous face with a healthy glow.  I think this product will work well on most people, because it&#x27;s only a hint of pink.  I&#x27;m a golden tan and mixed race, and my face looks flawless all day long with this awesome product.  Imagine you in candlelight with this.....AH-MA-ZING!!!!</li>
    <li> When I used this primer it made me &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; my skin was pasty and that I had a truck load of makeup on. I don&#x27;t use it but my 25 year old daughter started to use it. She uses it as a base for her makeup. But for me my makeup has coverage enough.</li>
    <li> Instantly smooths my skin.  Feels luxurious too!</li>
    <li> Very nice smooth finish. I used it on a bride a few days ago and have been using it myself since I got it. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> i like the primer leaves my face feeling smooth but i still find it that my makeup doesnt last that long but it is a big improvement compared to not wearing this primer</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on like a dream and makes your skin look FABULOUS! I am so happy that I discovered this line from Revlon, and will purchase again and again. If you are looking for a primer that will give your face a fresh and healthy look that will last all day, you&#x27;ve got to try Revlon Photoready Perfecting Primer. When you catch yourself in the mirror at the end of the day and realize that you look as though you just put on fresh make-up, you know that you are using a great primer!</li>
    <li> I always use Spackle primer but it is more expensive so I tried this and I love it. I went to work today and everyone commented on how nice my makeup looked.  They even wrote down the product name to order it.  I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and am starting to need something to make my skin look younger and this does it. It reminds me of when they would blur Cybil Shepard on moonlighting to  make her look younger.  Definitely a good price and make your foundation go farther.</li>
    <li> i just received it, and it really works u can see ur skin changing in front your eyes, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy it is just great i love it!!</li>
    <li> I love the application of this primer</li>
    <li> This product is so smooth, like a lotion. It goes on very easily and soaks into your skin fast so you dont need to wait for it to dry. It looks great even just by its self. It helps my foundation glide on so nice. It doesnt even need a setting power to be applied on top, but i do anyway. Usually my face gets oily and my power needs to be applied several times throughout the day. With this product my face stays matte all through the day! I love this product and would be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> This stuff was a bit tacky on my skin. My makeup did grab hold to it, but by lunch time my makeup had separated from it and my makeup looked spackled over my face. Then at night, it was ridiculously difficult to wash off! I had to scrub my face to get it all off. To top it off, it caused me to break out! Not worth it. I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Prefect..i have a oily face but this match perfect i dont need to used nothing else</li>
    <li> the pump froze up at first but was able to clean it out, my wife does like the product and is happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m black and it makes me look ashy</li>
    <li> I can definatley see a difference in how long my makeup stays on after using this product. Good amount of product. I love the packaging and the pump. And it smells good too!!</li>
    <li> Feel like it leaves your face harder which makes applying foundation/BB Cream harder to do, but it does help the product hold better. Has a funky smell to it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this through Amazon, but I have used this primer before. I didn&#x27;t like it at all. It turned crumbly on my face after it dried and looked like my face was peeling.</li>
