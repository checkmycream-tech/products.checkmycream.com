      <li>Love these!!!</li>
      <li>I look beautiful.</li>
      <li>I tried these because E. Lauder discontinued a great product years ago.  </li>
      <li>These are amazing!</li>
      <li>It is a good product and helps the eyes.</li>
      <li>These patches are good</li>
      <li>and I loved the feeling of them.</li>
      <li>The seller was great - okay price, product arrived within days.  </li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>They feel nice.</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s looks positioned way better.</li>
      <li>When I bought these I used them when my eyes were puffy and they worked like magic.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>Getting some more for sure.</li>
      <li>So I love these for my under eyes</li>
      <li>/&gt;You should buy these and perform a better, more organized experiment and let me know how it goes</li>
      <li>Amazing for deluding eyes right before makeup application or upon waking up while making coffee/ walking the dog</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of of eye things in the last 5 years and nothing no works as good as these!</li>
      <li>IF anyone can tell me a great product  that actually delivers the goods please let me know.</li>
      <li>They peel off so smoothly.</li>
      <li>Really light effect.  </li>
      <li>Still they are worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I use them to hydrate the eye area before I go out or have a special occasion.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s only one good thing about this, and that&#x27;s its usefulness as an under-eye shield while putting on makeup.</li>
      <li>They whiten under your eyes and feel cool  </li>
      <li>But in no way is this product worth $20.</li>
      <li>The fact that they stick in place under your eyes is a wonderfully useful feature.  </li>
      <li>I have these on my face right now because my wife got two samples.</li>
      <li>First I keep them in the freezer and slather under eye serum on first.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Nice product but pricey since you need to use Everyday.  </li>
      <li>Got them as samples and they made the area under my eyes smoother, more hydrated and lightened up the dark circles some.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
      <li>Like them, but wish they were a little more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>My wife says my eyes look &amp;#34;a little more awake&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve decided I slightly misplaced mine.</li>
      <li>These feel great—cool and refreshing, especially after a long day of staring at screens or suffering from allergies.</li>
      <li>These patches are mildly refreshing if you keep them in the refrigerator, and sometimes that cold fresh feeling is all you need to lift your spirits and make you look better overall.</li>
      <li>I first tried them following the instructions - patting around the patches as they were in place for 20+ minutes.  </li>
      <li>I would probably use them every single morning if there were more in a package or they were a little more affordable for how few you get.</li>
      <li>Very soothing reduces puffy tired eyes and smooths fine line.  </li>
      <li>but I expected a little better.  </li>
      <li>The right one is slightly sliding away.</li>
      <li>Would give them a 5 except they&#x27;re kind of expensive.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried these with really puffy eyes, but they are adequate for tired eyes.</li>
      <li>They really do help soothe skin and reduce puffiness and dark circles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve left them on all night under a sleep mask after a particularly long day and look completely refreshed the next morning.  </li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know if I was ugly or not before though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> would not buy again, slid on my skin and did not see a difference</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well</li>
    <li> Amazing for deluding eyes right before makeup application or upon waking up while making coffee/ walking the dog</li>
    <li> LOOOOOVE these!!!  Got them as samples and they made the area under my eyes smoother, more hydrated and lightened up the dark circles some.  Will DEFINITELY be purchasing these!</li>
    <li> The seller was great - okay price, product arrived within days.  But, I would say they do not work.  I first tried them following the instructions - patting around the patches as they were in place for 20+ minutes.  I did not see any difference in the puffy bags beneath my eyes.  Then a few days later, I tried the package suggestion of putting the package in the refrigerator.  I left them in there overnight.  I put the patches on, patted around them, left them on for 25 minutes this time - no change.  I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> These feel great—cool and refreshing, especially after a long day of staring at screens or suffering from allergies. They peel off so smoothly. Would give them a 5 except they&#x27;re kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using these, but maybe you&#x27;re supposed to use them every day? I used them a couple times a week when my allergies acted up.</li>
    <li> I have used these twice but didn&#x27;t notice any effect, or change.  I left them on for the recommended 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t see any difference after using them.  The cooling factor was nice, but overall I was Disappointed! Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Love these!!! They totally work. After twenty minutes of wearing these I noticed a visible difference in my lower eye area. There were zero signs of puffiness!</li>
    <li> Really light effect.  This only gets rid of the puffiness.</li>
    <li> These patches are mildly refreshing if you keep them in the refrigerator, and sometimes that cold fresh feeling is all you need to lift your spirits and make you look better overall. But in no way is this product worth $20. It doesn&#x27;t actually do anything for your under-eye area that you can&#x27;t get from a cold mask or used tea bags. There&#x27;s only one good thing about this, and that&#x27;s its usefulness as an under-eye shield while putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of of eye things in the last 5 years and nothing no works as good as these! I keep them in the fridge and use them when necessary or just before a photo!</li>
    <li> I have tried these several times and they do nothing for the puffiness under my eyes.  There is no difference before or after when I put them on.  I will not buy these again.</li>
    <li> After using these patches twice, I have not seen any noticeable difference in my eyes.  Not worth the money and will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love these! But they need to come down in price!</li>
    <li> I am a beauty product addict.  I tried these because E. Lauder discontinued a great product years ago.  These patches are good but I expected a little better.  I use them to hydrate the eye area before I go out or have a special occasion. Somehow it does slightly  improve the area.  All beauty products are hope in a jar.  IF anyone can tell me a great product  that actually delivers the goods please let me know.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these! I love them. They really do help soothe skin and reduce puffiness and dark circles. I was skeptical at first but now I use them any time I travel or have allergies. I would probably use them every single morning if there were more in a package or they were a little more affordable for how few you get. Still they are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have these on my face right now because my wife got two samples. They feel nice. Cooling, soothing sensation or something. The right one is slightly sliding away. I blame my fat cheek. Okay, I&#x27;ve decided I slightly misplaced mine. My wife&#x27;s looks positioned way better. Yeah, mine are definitely uneven. I can feel it. It&#x27;s not right. Is it twenty minutes, yet? We don&#x27;t know what time we put them on. This experiment is flawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just took them off. I look beautiful. I don&#x27;t know if I was ugly or not before though. I forgot to check. Maybe I didn&#x27;t have puffy cheeks. My wife says my eyes look &amp;#34;a little more awake&amp;#34;. So there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should buy these and perform a better, more organized experiment and let me know how it goes so I can change my review. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Nice product but pricey since you need to use Everyday.  Helps with puffiness and depth.</li>
    <li> So I love these for my under eyes but I use a couple tricks. First I keep them in the freezer and slather under eye serum on first. I put these on while I apply my eye makeup and after about 15 minutes or so , voilà no crepy, wrinkles!</li>
    <li> These are really great! Soothing and calming to the eye area.</li>
    <li> These stay put when you adhere them to your face.  I put them on in the morning while drying my hair and before applying makeup.  Like them, but wish they were a little more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I tried this as a sample and I loved the feeling of them. When I bought these I used them when my eyes were puffy and they worked like magic.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very soothing reduces puffy tired eyes and smooths fine line.  I&#x27;ve left them on all night under a sleep mask after a particularly long day and look completely refreshed the next morning.  Getting some more for sure.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Ive bought 3 times now!</li>
    <li> ........ I don&#x27;t see any difference after using these patches.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They whiten under your eyes and feel cool  The fact that they stick in place under your eyes is a wonderfully useful feature.  Put these on, close your eyes and relax.</li>
    <li> Still have some of these left and use them only from time to time. It is a good product and helps the eyes. thanks</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried these with really puffy eyes, but they are adequate for tired eyes.</li>
