      <li>I have tried many products for curl definition and frizz control...in every price range.</li>
      <li>If too much is used, it will give a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look, so it is best used judiciously until you determine how much you need.  </li>

      <li>my hair is like Teflon, nothing absorbs (which is why I gave up on the sulfate free systems as I need silicone).</li>
      <li>Nice natural defined curls!</li>
      <li>Before I used this product, pretty much every hair curled in its own direction ;)</li>
      <li>It took me a while to find the right combination of products that would work for my hair.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that works for my 2C-3A very fine hair.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair frizz free and soft.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t seem to find it my local grocery store or drug stores any more.</li>
      <li>Trying to embrace my curls, I wanted to find a product that would calm the curls into a semblance of normal &amp; get rid of the frizz.  </li>
      <li>your hair could use a little more umph!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much, Amazon.com for pretty much making this and other products available!</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work at all like the real gel.</li>
      <li>I was kept informed of the shipment and it arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>This product was not the real \\&quot;Curls Up\\&quot; gel.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>FX adds the right amount moisture without feeling greasy and my hair feels soft.</li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair and it really brings out the curl and controls frizz!</li>
      <li>so I leave it a little more damp and then put it on the lower part of my hair strands then on the very ends and scrunch it in while I have my head tipped downward.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>and I love that it helps my hair to be less frizzy and keeps my curls throughout the day without the crunchy feeling of hair gel.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and curls defined with NO crunchiness!!</li>
      <li>I have tried every cream and gel, from the most expensive to drug store brands, and I was very upset when it was no longer available in retail stores.</li>
      <li>I still use a spray to hold it down, but I love the natural look without the frizz.</li>
      <li>I have permed hair and have tried a wide variety of products to calm the frizz.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clear like a gel, goes on like a gel, but doesn&#x27;t make your hands sticky, and when it drys your curls aren&#x27;t crunchy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a clear gel that dries soft and pliable whether I air-dry or use the blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I have naturally medium curly hair</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy/curly hair.</li>
      <li>I DO NOT HAVE NATURALLY CURLY HAIR.  </li>
      <li>CURLS UP REACTIVATOR GEL EVERY TIME I SHAMPOO MY HAIR, AND PEOPLE THINK I HAVE NATURAL CURLS.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I apply it on really wet hair right after my shower, scrunch, and then put my hair in a Turbi-Twist for a while.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like to towel dry my hair too much</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find that the product responds completely differently to a dryer</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, defined and doesn&#x27;t dry it out or leave it crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product gives me both - the curls are soft &amp; loose &amp; the frizz is gone when I use FX Curls Up Defrizzant.  </li>

<li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it actually has restorative qualities like mending split ends if you use it long term, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to vouch for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have tried many products for curl definition and frizz control...in every price range. This product beats them all. I recommend it to people all the time. My hair stylist even asked me what I used and told her mom about it. It leaves my hair soft and curls defined with NO crunchiness!! I cannot find it in my local grocery stores or drug store chains. I don&#x27;t know why they have discontinued it. Now the local Ulta store has stopped carrying it even though they carry other products in this line. I will order it from Amazon as long as I can get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a clear gel that dries soft and pliable whether I air-dry or use the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this hair product. I can no longer find it locally so I&#x27;m glad this seller supplies it. I am Africa American and my hair is dry and course. FX adds the right amount moisture without feeling greasy and my hair feels soft. I was kept informed of the shipment and it arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I found this on Amazon. At one time I could purchase it in several local stores. I even tried the Fx website. I don&#x27;t know what I would do with my hair without the Curls Up Defrizzant. It is the best product for frizzy wavy hair. I have tried many of them. It keeps my hair frizz free and soft. Other products leave my hair still frizzy or crunchy. Curls Up is fantastic!</li>
    <li> This product was not the real \\&quot;Curls Up\\&quot; gel. I am so sorry I wasted my money. The gel is not the same consistency, smell, or color. The bottle is not the same at all. This is obviously not real. It doesn&#x27;t work at all like the real gel. It is terrible.I don&#x27;t know what this was, but it IS NOT F/X \\&quot;Curls Up\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> best curl product around for naturally curly hair and I have tried a lot of salon brands too.</li>
    <li> This works great combined with leave in conditioner to control my curls and leave my hair feeling soft.  It took me a while to find the right combination of products that would work for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this! Can&#x27;t seem to find it my local grocery store or drug stores any more. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or sticky. I put it on damp hair (after I shower). I don&#x27;t like to towel dry my hair too much so I leave it a little more damp and then put it on the lower part of my hair strands then on the very ends and scrunch it in while I have my head tipped downward. Then I let it air dry. Nice natural defined curls!</li>
    <li> I have permed hair and have tried a wide variety of products to calm the frizz. The one that has worked best for me and that I have used for years is Curls Up. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT HAVE NATURALLY CURLY HAIR.  I USE A DIME SIZE OF THE FX:CURLS UP REACTIVATOR GEL EVERY TIME I SHAMPOO MY HAIR, AND PEOPLE THINK I HAVE NATURAL CURLS. THE CURL BOOSTER FIXATIVE GEL IS MUCH BETTER, BUT I CANNOT FIND IT.</li>
    <li> Best product for naturally curly hair.  I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair. The FX Curls up Defrizzant works for me. It leaves my hair soft. I still use a spray to hold it down, but I love the natural look without the frizz.</li>
    <li> FX Curls Up gathers your hair so that your curls look bigger and prettier. Before I used this product, pretty much every hair curled in its own direction ;)</li>
    <li> I have short, curly hair.  For years I tried to straighten it, only to have it frizz up again once I walked outdoors.  Trying to embrace my curls, I wanted to find a product that would calm the curls into a semblance of normal &amp; get rid of the frizz.  This product gives me both - the curls are soft &amp; loose &amp; the frizz is gone when I use FX Curls Up Defrizzant.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works for my 2C-3A very fine hair. I have a very closed cuticle...my hair is like Teflon, nothing absorbs (which is why I gave up on the sulfate free systems as I need silicone). I have used it for years and was disappointed that my local stores stopped carrying it. Some reviewers have complained about a sticky feel. I have never had that problem before, but I always air dry. Finally bought a hairdryer since I was sick of wet head in the winters, so I wanted to try diffusing in the the winter. I was surprised to find that the product responds completely differently to a dryer and I got some of the sticky, slimy weird feel that others complain about here. So I recommend experimenting with applying at different hair dampness and air-drying vs. blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 or 6 years now.  It is the only product I have found that defines curls and tames frizz without getting crunchy.  My hair is 2C/3A curl type and is between BSL and WL. If too much is used, it will give a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look, so it is best used judiciously until you determine how much you need.  I apply it on really wet hair right after my shower, scrunch, and then put my hair in a Turbi-Twist for a while.  I then flip my head over, blow dry my roots and scrunch the rest on the low setting to set my curls, and then let it dry the rest of the way naturally.</li>
    <li> Have bought this repeatedly. I have natural curly hair and it really brings out the curl and controls frizz!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...I have used it on my hair since I was a teenager. I have naturally medium curly hair and I love that it helps my hair to be less frizzy and keeps my curls throughout the day without the crunchy feeling of hair gel. The lids do not stay closed tight ( they never have) and although the seller attempted to tape them shut the bottles still leaked a little into the box...other than that everything was great!</li>
    <li> This gel captures the curls in my hair when it is wet. It is the best defrizzant I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this is the only product that controls it and makes it shiny without feeling greasy or heavy. I have tried every cream and gel, from the most expensive to drug store brands, and I was very upset when it was no longer available in retail stores. Thank you so much, Amazon.com for pretty much making this and other products available! The makers of discontinued products always say they have improved the products, but they should keep in mind that when we find things that work for us, we don&#x27;t want them to change them!!</li>
    <li> I love this. I am so thankful that I can buy it on Amazon because it&#x27;s no longer on shelves anywhere local. I order a case at a time. It leaves my hair soft, defined and doesn&#x27;t dry it out or leave it crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything and this one is the best!</li>
    <li> So I actually bought this at walgreens but wanted to review it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair could use a little more umph! this is a kicka** product. It&#x27;s clear like a gel, goes on like a gel, but doesn&#x27;t make your hands sticky, and when it drys your curls aren&#x27;t crunchy. It&#x27;s very light weight and on par with some curl enhancing creams more then a gel styling product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it actually has restorative qualities like mending split ends if you use it long term, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to vouch for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives my hair volume and added definition to the curl. You can only use the product on wet hair and it does have a heavy fragrance, but I happen to like it and it goes away after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get it gurl.</li>
