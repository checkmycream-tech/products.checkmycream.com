      <li>The genius who designed this could have solved the problem using good quality mesh for the rear to allow drainage and drying.</li>
      <li>Good quality-</li>
      <li>Very comfortable!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, this would make a nice gift.</li>
      <li>Great quality pillow, excited to use it.</li>
      <li>Quality seems to be great, so far  I didn&#x27;t have any issue with leaking and material feels good on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off using a loaf of bead stuffed in a plastic bag duct-taped to your tub.</li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s being sold at, I&#x27;d expect more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure that&#x27;s something most people would want.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I hoped for better from these folks.</li>
      <li>It is nice and comfortable.</li>
      <li>Water will be able to seep inside the pillow case via the zipper.</li>
      <li>I received this item several weeks ago &amp; was initially impressed with it.</li>
      <li>I was expecting something plumper and more cushioned.</li>
      <li>I am a good and steady customer and have always been pleased with your items.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and the perfect size, but it began to mildew after two weeks despite my attempts to keep it dry.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free sample of this bath pillow for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did deduct a star for the price, if I saw this in the store I would expect to see a more reasonable price of around $12.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>- I thought this would be so much better than it really turned out to be.</li>
      <li>The foam inside is soft and feels very comfortable on my neck.</li>
      <li>The size just right.</li>
      <li>but just right.</li>
      <li>Looks like a great little company!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as big as I thought it would be, but it fits nicely in my tub and definitely helps bath time be a bit more comfy.</li>
      <li>Received very fast.</li>
      <li>Smaller than I thought but was very comfortable.</li>
      <li>when I tested this one, I was surprised at how comfortable it is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice size for relaxing in the tub and feels  so much better than a rolled up towel behind your neck.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to clean it off then coat the disc with clear fingernail</li>
      <li>think the pillow is comfortable, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s free from the possibility of mold and mildew forming inside it due to water/moisture seeping inside through the zipper.</li>
      <li>This pillow is pretty much as described.  </li>
      <li>The core is wrapped in plastic and heat sealed all the way around to water proof the foam, also making it easy to wipe down and clean</li>
      <li>and you would not have nearly as much support as the pillow has when air is in the bag.</li>
      <li>I have been working out, quite a lot lately and as a consequence, I have started to notice more and more pain in my back, neck and shoulders.</li>
      <li>Used it in my  bath and it absorbed so much water and its starting to come apart</li>
      <li>I bought this pillow as a gift and had expected it to come in its own packaging, not only so I could wrap it, but because the packaging makes it look like an unused product--which it is!</li>
      <li>but it is not thick at all.</li>
      <li>I should be reimbursed, frankly (this pillow is not cheap)...or supplied with a new one.....</li>
      <li>I love the small, compact size.</li>
      <li>arrived a pretty buttery off white color.</li>
      <li>It does not adhere properly to the bath tub in a consistent way.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not stiff or too soft...</li>
      <li>This item does not attach to the tub very well, and falls off continually, I finally through it away!</li>
      <li>The pillow I received had zero packaging and not even a tag or logo, just the Amazon fulfillment sticker directly on the pleather.  </li>
      <li>The interior is filled with a  soft foam, tapered cushion which is covered in heavy plastic to keep the water out.</li>
      <li>The only thing that surprised me (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that when it was shipped by Amazon&#x27;s fulfillment center in a box with other items, this pillow had no plastic covering to protect it, let alone coming in its own box.  </li>
      <li>Because we have a decent bath here at home, I decided to transform it to something similar they had at a spa</li>
      <li>One side of both the pillow fabric and the backing strip was retained just barely by the metal ring and there is obviously no way for me to repair it.</li>

<li> I only used the pillow once a week or less</li>
<li> /&gt;This is a foam bath pillow with an imitation leather, zippered cover.</li>
<li> This is not worth $50 or even the sale price of $30.</li>
<li> It started getting dark spots on the covering.</li>

<li> Foam compresses after a use or two and soon fails completely.</li>
<li> I went to a few massages and spa treatments and they worked well for me</li>
<li> Maybe a few inches in height-</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Within a few weeks of using this product, I found a small black mark that turned out to be a piece of the pillow that had ripped.  </li>
<li> I find it to be a little too hard.</li>

<li> :/  </li>
<li> /&gt;THE SUCTION CUPS ARE TOO SMALL AND FLIMSY...</li>
<li> but no more than that.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m a bit skeptical  regarding the longevity of the pillows cover, especially after being exposed to water and soap.</li>
<li> the suction cups have rusted - not very good quality</li>
<li> and it is in such a bad shape already.</li>
<li> Quite a few years ago, I purchased a bath pillow &amp; found it to be so uncomfortable that I never tried another</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not used to this poor quality from Amazon.</li>
<li> For the amount they charged, I was not impressed.</li>
<li> The pillow is now useless.</li>
<li> Very poor.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> too bad.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Does not hold up at all. Used it in my  bath and it absorbed so much water and its starting to come apart</li>
    <li> The pillow was in perfect condition when it arrived.  It is essentially a small neck-rest pillow covered in a plastic synthetic leather (to make it water resistant) with two suction cups to attach it to your hot tub or Jacuzzi. The only thing that surprised me (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that when it was shipped by Amazon&#x27;s fulfillment center in a box with other items, this pillow had no plastic covering to protect it, let alone coming in its own box.  I bought this pillow as a gift and had expected it to come in its own packaging, not only so I could wrap it, but because the packaging makes it look like an unused product--which it is! The pillow I received had zero packaging and not even a tag or logo, just the Amazon fulfillment sticker directly on the pleather.  This is not a problem with the product, nonetheless I was not 100% happy.  I also cannot comment on the comfort or longevity of the product as I can&#x27;t test it.</li>
    <li> I received this item several weeks ago &amp; was initially impressed with it. However, today is a different story. I was repositioning it on the tub for my grandson today &amp; one of the suction cups pulled out of the pillow. Upon checking the pillow, I found that the retaining&lt;br /&gt;ring that reinforces the suction cup was not centered on its hole in the pillow. The same applies to the fabric backing strip on the&lt;br /&gt;inside of the pillow. One side of both the pillow fabric and the backing strip was retained just barely by the metal ring and there is obviously no way for me to repair it. What would be your suggestion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R. L. Myers</li>
    <li> This item does not attach to the tub very well, and falls off continually, I finally through it away!</li>
    <li> I was provided a sample item from Act &amp; Relax for evaluation and review. My initial impression on this bath pillow is that I do like it. It&#x27;s a nice size for relaxing in the tub and feels  so much better than a rolled up towel behind your neck. The two suction cups in the back  seem like they will last  awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outside is imitation leather, it feels soft to the touch and mine arrived a pretty buttery off white color. Not white as shown in the picture. There is a zipper on the back giving access to the sponge core inside. The core is wrapped in plastic and heat sealed all the way around to water proof the foam, also making it easy to wipe down and clean if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m writing this review I am sitting in a 100% imitation leather recliner that continues to shed and flake off pieces of the outside exposing the material underneath. :/  Looking at the cover on this pillow it is very, very similar to the material used on my chair so I&#x27;m a bit skeptical  regarding the longevity of the pillows cover, especially after being exposed to water and soap. Only time will tell so I will update my review after I have used this for awhile. I did deduct a star for the price, if I saw this in the store I would expect to see a more reasonable price of around $12.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this would make a nice gift. Added to a basket with an assortment of sample soaps, scrubbies and bath items, any bath lover would be happy to receive this bath pillow.</li>
    <li> For the amount they charged, I was not impressed. This is not worth $50 or even the sale price of $30. If I saw this at the store, I MIGHT have paid $15 for it- might- but no more than that. I knew it would be small but it is not thick at all. Maybe a few inches in height- I was expecting something plumper and more cushioned. Am really disappointed - I thought this would be so much better than it really turned out to be.</li>
    <li> It is nice and comfortable. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Good quality- just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:da5bd165a27e8b13b142f1af0e7d9462]]UPDATE: 11/10/2014 - I&#x27;ve updated my video review to show you the mold/mildew that has formed on the outside and inside of the bath pillow. There is also rust around the metal grommets where the suction cups attach to the pillow. Furthermore the 100% Imitation Leather is cracking all along the bottom outside edge. As a result of this I have reduced the rating of this product and would advise you avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free sample of this bath pillow for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a foam bath pillow with an imitation leather, zippered cover. Two suction cups on the back attach the pillow to your bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A zipper on the back allows access to the foam piece inside. The foam piece is actually enclosed in an air-filled plastic bag. This could possibly cause some issues. If the bag were to be punctured the air would leak out and you would not have nearly as much support as the pillow has when air is in the bag. Also, if it were to be punctured, water could enter the bag and eventually that could lead to mold &amp; mildew forming inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming you never puncture the bag there is still an issue. Water will be able to seep inside the pillow case via the zipper. Unless you frequently dry it out, mold &amp; mildew will form inside. I&#x27;m not so sure that&#x27;s something most people would want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the pillow is comfortable, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s free from the possibility of mold and mildew forming inside it due to water/moisture seeping inside through the zipper. For the price it&#x27;s being sold at, I&#x27;d expect more.</li>
    <li> Received very fast. Suction cups worked well. Very comfortable! Would recommend this to anyone else.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this pillow.</li>
    <li> I love the small, compact size. Perfect for a bath. Does just as advertised. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> Quite a few years ago, I purchased a bath pillow &amp; found it to be so uncomfortable that I never tried another one.&lt;br /&gt;So when I tested this one, I was surprised at how comfortable it is. It&#x27;s the perfect size to support my neck &amp; head...  it&#x27;s not stiff or too soft...but just right. The pillow does not have any odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made from soft, faux (imitation) leather. The interior is filled with a  soft foam, tapered cushion which is covered in heavy plastic to keep the water out. The bath pillow has a zipper in the back &amp; 2 suction cups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate Measurements:&lt;br /&gt;11\\&quot; x 5\\&quot; x 3\\&quot; (3\\&quot; at its thickest, tapering down to about 2\\&quot; on each side)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review if my opinion changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: There is some rust forming on the metal disc holding one of the suction cups. I&#x27;m going to clean it off then coat the disc with clear fingernail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 1/2 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and the perfect size, but it began to mildew after two weeks despite my attempts to keep it dry.  I don&#x27;t have mildew issues with anything else in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Got it despite the reviews to see for myself. Yup, it&#x27;s a mold factory. Found mold in it 5 after 5 days of use. The genius who designed this could have solved the problem using good quality mesh for the rear to allow drainage and drying. The suction cups are the only things that don&#x27;t suck. I mean, they really don&#x27;t, so the damn thing slides all over the place. You&#x27;re better off using a loaf of bead stuffed in a plastic bag duct-taped to your tub.</li>
    <li> THE 3 PILLOWS I BOUGHT WERE ALL DEFECTIVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SUCTION CUPS ARE TOO SMALL AND FLIMSY...SO THEY FALL OFF THE PILLOW IN A WEEK OR SO AS THEY ARE NOT PERMANENTLY ATTACHED TO THE PILLOW!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THEM UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ABOVE!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality pillow, excited to use it. Also, they sent me a coupon for 10% off my next purchase. Looks like a great little company!</li>
    <li> This pillow is pretty much as described.  It&#x27;s not quite as big as I thought it would be, but it fits nicely in my tub and definitely helps bath time be a bit more comfy.</li>
    <li> Suction cup is too loose to hold the head</li>
    <li> Perfect for a relaxing soak in the tub</li>
    <li> I find it to be a little too hard.</li>
    <li> Not very good - I left it in my hot tub for 4 days and the suction cups do not suck anymore - plus around the suction cups have rusted - not very good quality</li>
    <li> The experience was flawless and the neck pillow was everything I had hoped for. Relaxation awaits! - Amy Fuchs</li>
    <li> Very poor. It does not adhere properly to the bath tub in a consistent way. When I tried to remove it to move it a little, one of the suction cups on the back totally broke off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not used to this poor quality from Amazon. I am a good and steady customer and have always been pleased with your items. I should be reimbursed, frankly (this pillow is not cheap)...or supplied with a new one.....hopefully another style.</li>
    <li> I have been working out, quite a lot lately and as a consequence, I have started to notice more and more pain in my back, neck and shoulders. Because I have wanted to ease my pain I went to a few massages and spa treatments and they worked well for me, the only problem was that those treatments take quite a lot of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;So I started looking at alternative solutions. Because we have a decent bath here at home, I decided to transform it to something similar they had at a spa treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So one of the things I bought was this bathtub pillow. I have to say that it does just what it is supposed to. The suction cups do a great job of keeping the pillow in place. The foam inside is soft and feels very comfortable on my neck. Quality seems to be great, so far  I didn&#x27;t have any issue with leaking and material feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to upgrade their bathtub experience.</li>
    <li> I got that pillow 6 month now and decided to just throw it out. It started getting dark spots on the covering. One of the suctions ripped off. I only used the pillow once a week or less and it is in such a bad shape already. I&#x27;m really disappointed. Waste of money. Looking for a different one now</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but was very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Within a few weeks of using this product, I found a small black mark that turned out to be a piece of the pillow that had ripped.  After 3 months of use, it looks like it was eaten by a moth.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the pillow for two months now. Used it five times. The cover is great ! The size just right. The foam insert is NOT at all.  Foam compresses after a use or two and soon fails completely. The pillow is now useless. too bad. I hoped for better from these folks.</li>
