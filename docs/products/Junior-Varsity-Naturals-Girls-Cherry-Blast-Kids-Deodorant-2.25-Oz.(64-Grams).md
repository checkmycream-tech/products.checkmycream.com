      <li>buy the end of the day my daughter still had the sweater under arm smell, and she is not very active, but we do live in the tropics</li>
      <li>The 10 year old is relatively active, and his parents&#x27; really appreciated that it was natural.  </li>
      <li>My daughter is not an athletic 10 year old, so I thought this product would block her occasional body odor.  </li>
      <li>I got this for my 7 year old daughter who seems to have a odor problem all of a sudden under her pits!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if this deodorant is just not for very hot climates.  </li>

    <li> I bought this for 9 year daughter but it wasn&#x27;t effective at all.  I had to switch her to Secret.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my child about 2 weeks ago. It said it was shipped and was supposed to arrive this week. Then today I got an email saying the order was canceled because the product was out of stock. Worst company experience I have ever seen!</li>
    <li> Work and smells great.  My 8 year old loves it.  And it doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything creepy in it.</li>
    <li> Overall I just like the more natural ingredients.  It definitely works for younger pre-adolescents.  As the hormones start kicking when they get older, you&#x27;ll need something stronger.  It smells a lot like a Cherry Italian Icee.  My son and I liked the smell, but the deo is for my 9 yo daughter, and it took a bit for her to get used to it.  She has no problem wearing it now.  When my son was that age, I got him the unscented for boys.  That worked well at first, but he eventually started to want something with a scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and when she remembers to use it, it works! I was surprised by all the negative reviews as I was very impressed that it worked. My daughter loves it and her sensitive had no issues whatsoever with it.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 5 and started getting odor and really wanted to be an adult so we purchased this. She did great with it for a week then got bumps under her arms. We&#x27;ve had to stop using it and instead went to Toms brand.  The smell was nice and it did work but just not for her skin.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 3yr-old daughter because she wanted to do everything that mom did. I did not want her to use her because of all the chemicals. Did some research on ine and this was the best I could find. My daughter loves it and the cherry scent is just right. Recommended it to several friends and family members.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters.  One of my daughters (10/8) gets rashes under her arm when using a normal deodorant so I decided to go with this natural deodorant and well it did not work as I expected.  buy the end of the day my daughter still had the sweater under arm smell, and she is not very active, but we do live in the tropics so I&#x27;m not sure if this deodorant is just not for very hot climates.  Will not repurchase and I will be looking for another alternative.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to review Junior Varsity Naturals Kids Deodorant. We received full size samples of both the Cherry Blast and Citrus Sport natural deodorants to try. We kept the Cherry Blast, and gave the Citrus Sports to our friends&#x27; 10 year old son to try.&lt;br /&gt;The girls were so excited to review this natural kids deodorant. Coco and I opened the package while waiting for Lulu to get off the school bus. When she got off the school bus, they decided that they needed to take a shower right then and there, but we had company over, a 4 year old family friend, and had someplace to be in about 35 minutes. So they took a shower that evening. I think this was the first time EVER that they were excited to take a shower over a bath. They felt the shower would get them to the deodorant more quickly, I think. Now it is part of their after-bath routine. And I&#x27;m okay with that. With all-natural ingredients and a pleasant, fruity smell, I don&#x27;t mind that they&#x27;re always reaching for their new, natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed feedback about the deodorant we gave away.  The 10 year old is relatively active, and his parents&#x27; really appreciated that it was natural.  He had been using deodorant before, and this one is working out well.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a good fit if you&#x27;re nervous about the chemically-laden products currently on the market, especially when you&#x27;re using them on your children. While my daughters are only 4 and 6, we&#x27;ve been using as many natural products as we can (afford), ever since my youngest was diagnosed with a congenital adrenal deficiency shortly after birth. And although many people wouldn&#x27;t think that 4 and 6 year olds need deodorant, when they&#x27;re playing outside, in 100 degree weather (like today, in Columbia, SC), they are STINKY when they come inside. This deodorant helps with that. I also like to rub it across the bottom of their feet, and it helps their feet not to stink and sweat so much.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll have to decide for yourself when it is appropriate for your children to begin using deodorant, but when you do make that decision, reach for an all natural deodorant like Junior Varsity Naturals Kids Deodorant It currently retails for $6.99. Plus, they offer free shipping for US and Canadian customers.r children to begin using deodorant, but when you do make that decision, reach for an all natural deodorant like Junior Varsity Naturals Kids Deodorant It currently retails for $6.99.

    <li> My daughter did not like the smell</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because it is natural and non-toxic. Unfortunately, the smell made her gag and she didn&#x27;t want to be anywhere near it. It such a sickly sweet smell, I can understand her feeling about it.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see a deodorant that was free of harmful chemicals for my 8 year old daughter. However, it just doesn&#x27;t work and the smell of the product is terrible...like cherry cough syrup. So we switched to tom&#x27;s of Maine. It has propylene glycol, unfortunately, but it&#x27;s better than the others out there. And it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> My daughter is only 7 and unfortunately has some issues in that dept. after using this item there are no worries. But i have realized she puts in on the wrong spot lol.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 7 year old daughter who seems to have a odor problem all of a sudden under her pits! It&#x27;s crazy! Even after scrubbing her pits in the shower I sniff them and it still stinks! Anyway I got this because I wanted something natural and meant for kids with no harmful ingredients and like I said it&#x27;s okay. I mean I like it because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; for her but it doesn&#x27;t do the greatest job of masking the smell.</li>

    <li> it has a good scent however does not provide excellent protection, just Ok, it lasts for few hrs but not whole day</li>
    <li> My daughter is not an athletic 10 year old, so I thought this product would block her occasional body odor.  It has not.</li>
