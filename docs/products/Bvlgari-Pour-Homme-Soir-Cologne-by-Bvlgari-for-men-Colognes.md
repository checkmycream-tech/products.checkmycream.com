      <li>It won&#x27;t last the whole day, you often have to put it on 2-3 times a day</li>
      <li>and then when yov wake vp yov have only to take a deep breath and yov know that all is right with the world because ov are one with Bvlgari.</li>

    <li> great product half the price of macy&#x27;s, scent is great not too sweet or dry, it last all day, received on time.</li>
    <li> My dad loved his gift that I bought him for fathers dad, it got to him very quick. The only thing that disappointed me was that amazon left the invoice in the package which had the price of the product, I had asked  not to put the invoice in the box. Also I had written a card to be sent along with it and it was not in the box. I was very disappointed about that. Other than that the product is great quality and a very great price.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my dad, and he was really satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of on the wire with this scent.  I think I smell grapefruit when I put it on.  It&#x27;s a fresh smell.  I&#x27;m not sure how much I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my man for Valentines day because I have smelled it before and couldn&#x27;t get it out of my head. It changes throughout the day and smells better and better. I can&#x27;t get enough of his neck when he wears it! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Found this in a retail store while the wife was shoppin..But the $52 they wanted didnt play, so I hit up Amazon.  I like it, and will purchase more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my mom (she loves cologne... don&#x27;t ask haha) and my boyfriend! They both loved it! Great, clean scent that lasts.</li>
    <li> Smells nice; have received compliments. Would recommend to any guys out wanting to smell good.</li>
    <li> you know the axe commerical, my reaction to the smell of this is like the axe commercial. its the best cologne ive ever smelled lol it was a present for my bf.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff yov only dream abovt when yov have the kind of dreams yov want to remember. The presence of Bvlgari remains with yov until yov go to sleep and then when yov wake vp yov have only to take a deep breath and yov know that all is right with the world because ov are one with Bvlgari. Thank yov for a great prodvct and anyone who comes near me will know what I vse. Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;Joe Wilson</li>
    <li> A soft yet masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for the &#x27;grown&#x27; man that&#x27;s tired of smelling like he&#x27;s still in college.</li>
    <li> I always use this fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very goood~</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne.  For me it lasts 24 hours.  The scent is nice and clean. You can never go wrong with a Bvlgari.</li>
    <li> This was a blind buy but so far so good for me. It was kinda steal for me at that price.</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff I&#x27;ve purchased locally before. The scent is wonderful. It is nice to be able to get it for much cheaper online.</li>
    <li> Fragrant, manly, sophisticated smell that really lasts without being overpowering. I&#x27;m in my twenties but this is great for all ages. It doesn&#x27;t have that strong, old-man smell to it (think Drakkar Noir) or that immature teenager smell (think Axe). I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments! I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> The cologne itself is great but the spray bottle was defective.  Very annoying.</li>
    <li> smells like heaven women love it&lt;br /&gt;smell like a man without being  over bearing when i put it on i feel clean and sexy</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this cologne, but it is a little, too light.... It won&#x27;t last the whole day, you often have to put it on 2-3 times a day (approx. 4 hours apart).  Otherwise, it is a great scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other Bvlgari colognes before and this continues the tradition of masculine, clean tones. I&#x27;m not in love with this particular one, but it&#x27;s good. Not quite me though. Feels like it&#x27;s for a more mature man with a vacation home in Europe that has a book collection...</li>
    <li> Brand new and smells great!</li>
    <li> BVLGARI Soir is my favorite cologne. Being half Italian, always had a little bent towards my Italian brands but this one keeps our heads up!!!! Very Classy, sober and soothing. Has been my favorite cologne for the last five years. window shopping and trying testers of other perfumes around have not yet succeeded in switching this one.</li>
