      <li>THEY ARE GOOD FOR SO MANY THINGS THAT THEY COULD WRITE A BOOK.</li>
      <li>Great product for keeping your hands clean when you can&#x27;t wash them.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for hand or equipment and can clean quite a bit.</li>
      <li>It is especially important to thoroughly clean your hands after using gasoline pumps, or handling cash---both are cesspools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very handy to keep on desk to clean hands after handling money.  </li>
      <li>would be more cost effective..</li>
      <li>Love these for the kids faces and hands.</li>
      <li>Everything cleaned smells so much better.  </li>
      <li>Love these wipes.</li>
      <li>(it is a #1; smells like a candle when burned) are much better.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;&amp;#62; For me, the one outstanding feature of &amp;#34;Wet Ones&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Refreshing.</li>
      <li>Love the smell very general on the hands great for my lilt one that has many allergies</li>
      <li>Gets the job done but too strong.</li>
      <li>The smell is absurdly strong and the towels didn&#x27;t separate as I was pulling them out...</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell of this citrus one, very clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>They have a nice clean fresh scent, and are a must have item for anyone.</li>
      <li>The wipes work fine</li>
      <li>They work fine for me.</li>
      <li>Good for a general face wash.  </li>
      <li>If you just use it to clean your keyboard, mouse, and monitor you can re-use this a couple of times too.  </li>
      <li>These do a good job of cleaning the crud off of messy hands, but the scent is very strong.</li>
      <li>These containers fit perfectly in any car&#x27;s standard drink holder -- and are great to have after pumping gas, eating on the run, sneezing, or any other unsavory occurrence that inevitably occurs when you can&#x27;t find a napkin.</li>
      <li>These also work well in the office if you want to eat a quick snack at your desk, and don&#x27;t have time to go to the restroom and wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
      <li>Not lemony/citrusy, but very much like pina colada!</li>
      <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>They do go quick if you use them consistently</li>
      <li>I also use them to clean my computer keyboards, desktop, telephone, door knobs, and pretty much anything anyone touches.</li>
      <li>The wipes are very moist and not dried out at all, which pleases me because the ones I buy at the grocery store are often dried out of moisture, which defeats the purpose of &amp;#34;antibacterial wipes.&amp;#34; This one is surprisingly moist, smells a bit like citrus, and I&#x27;m excited to start using them!</li>
      <li>At home I simply wash my face more often.  </li>
      <li>, Wet Ones were recommended to us by our allergist for effectively removing peanut protein off of things.</li>
      <li>Individual wrapped Wet Ones are great for travel; I made the mistake of getting 8 boxes for the whole house.</li>
      <li>as opposed to all other brands I&#x27;ve found, is that &amp;#34;Wet Ones&amp;#34; fit in the beverage holders of both of my cars (VWs), so that I can clean my hands</li>
      <li>I expected this to smell like lemon spray cleaner and was so pleasantly surprised that it actually smells mildly fruity and kind of sweet.</li>
      <li>To effectively kill norovirus you must completely soak both hands, thoroughly rub them together including fingertips and between fingers, and do that until your hands are dry.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use especially with toddlers that touch everything and then want to touch their face.  </li>
      <li>I love Wet Ones.  </li>
      <li>Simple, Light to carry.</li>
      <li>The cost was reasonable.</li>
      <li>i use on everything nice small too thx deb</li>
      <li>You need to use Wet Ones to get your hands thoroughly clean first, then an alcohol based hand wash like Clorox bleach-free hand sanitizer.</li>
      <li>MUST have for mothers of toddlers, I couldn&#x27;t live without these in my  baby bag!</li>
      <li>Gentle on sensitive skin too.</li>
      <li>I like using these more than surface disinfecting wipes because they don&#x27;t feel so harsh on my skin.</li>
      <li>maybe the tube they sent me was old or something.  </li>
      <li>and I can still smell them when my hands are near my face, like while I&#x27;m eating.</li>
      <li>Moral of the story, don&#x27;t buy 8 containers unless you know they won&#x27;t hurt your sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Also great for when the kids are sick..</li>
      <li>The most disgusting thing is the first used wipe was filled back.</li>

<li> The most disgusting thing is the first used wipe was filled back.</li>
<li> I only use it due to sensitive my nose.</li>
<li> and I like that they are gentle enough for skin, but wet enough to use to wipe down the leather furniture.  </li>
<li> ; It can be hard to start a new roll.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The lid is small, so it is hard to close without some of catching some of the wet towel, which will then wick out the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Some wipes you buy dry out in a short time after being opened.</li>
<li> Two minutes with actual soap and running water will also work, but hand sanitizers and Wet Ones are for when you can&#x27;t wash with soap and water.</li>
<li> These are certainly wet, but like others have said, they smell funky.</li>
<li> benzethonium chloride (the active ingredient in Wet Ones (kills 99.99% of germs)) does not kill norovirus.</li>
<li> ; Since you usually touch your steering wheel before getting to the anti-bacterial wipes, remember to clean it after you&#x27;ve finished cleaning your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The wipes are also very helpful for cleaning bird crap or smashed insects from your windshield, cleaning your windshield wipers, etc.&lt;br</li>

<li> I get into my car (other than when leaving home).  </li>
<li> They are very wet as well.</li>
<li> I use them to wipe down carriages in stores before I use them!</li>
<li> if I wipe down the dashboard; also doesn&#x27;t leave lint behind like using papertowels etc.</li>
<li> Not good wipes are hard to take out.</li>
<li> Since we recycle, compost, incinerate and don&#x27;t even use trash pickup, a plastic sleeve for every wipe is not good.</li>
<li> I like Wet Ones, but this citrus caused an awful skin reaction.  </li>
<li> hand sanitizer kill norovirus on dirty hands.</li>
<li> It is quite unpleasant.  </li>
<li> THESE CONTAIN CANCER CAUSING PARABENS :(</li>

    <li> Gross... soapy disgustingness  in a tube.  The smell is absurdly strong and the towels didn&#x27;t separate as I was pulling them out... maybe the tube they sent me was old or something.  I threw them out.</li>
    <li> They work fine for me. I use them whin I eat outside and get food residue on my hands or face. I wipe my hands with them when I am somewhere eating in the car.r.</li>
    <li> BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; For me, the one outstanding feature of &amp;#34;Wet Ones&amp;#34; as opposed to all other brands I&#x27;ve found, is that &amp;#34;Wet Ones&amp;#34; fit in the beverage holders of both of my cars (VWs), so that I can clean my hands everytime I get into my car (other than when leaving home).  It is especially important to thoroughly clean your hands after using gasoline pumps, or handling cash---both are cesspools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Since you usually touch your steering wheel before getting to the anti-bacterial wipes, remember to clean it after you&#x27;ve finished cleaning your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The wipes are also very helpful for cleaning bird crap or smashed insects from your windshield, cleaning your windshield wipers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; It can be hard to start a new roll.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The lid is small, so it is hard to close without some of catching some of the wet towel, which will then wick out the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but too strong.</li>
    <li> Great product for keeping your hands clean when you can&#x27;t wash them.</li>
    <li> MUST have for mothers of toddlers, I couldn&#x27;t live without these in my  baby bag! Gentle on sensitive skin too.</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients after purchasing. These contain parabens - beware.</li>
    <li> Individual wrapped Wet Ones are great for travel; I made the mistake of getting 8 boxes for the whole house. Since we recycle, compost, incinerate and don&#x27;t even use trash pickup, a plastic sleeve for every wipe is not good. A recyclable container and lid (it is a #1; smells like a candle when burned) are much better. The product doesn&#x27;t say for your face but I occasionally use it on my face or body because it is all I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: benzethonium chloride (the active ingredient in Wet Ones (kills 99.99% of germs)) does not kill norovirus. Neither will an alcohol based hand sanitizer kill norovirus on dirty hands. You need to use Wet Ones to get your hands thoroughly clean first, then an alcohol based hand wash like Clorox bleach-free hand sanitizer. To effectively kill norovirus you must completely soak both hands, thoroughly rub them together including fingertips and between fingers, and do that until your hands are dry. Two minutes with actual soap and running water will also work, but hand sanitizers and Wet Ones are for when you can&#x27;t wash with soap and water.</li>
    <li> Best smelling wipe ever, just heavenly!</li>
    <li> i use on everything nice small too thx deb</li>
    <li> I love Wet Ones.  They are great for the office, car, home, picnic....basically everywhere.  I am a germaphobe and I am always sanitizing. I like to keep these at my desk for cleaning and sanitizing my keyboard, mouse, and phone every morning. they also work well to sanitize cell phones. I keep these in the car as well for wiping my hands after filling the tank. These also work well in the office if you want to eat a quick snack at your desk, and don&#x27;t have time to go to the restroom and wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
    <li> They smell like suncreen (coconut?)  Which I prefer to citrus anyway, I put these in my boyfriend&#x27;s car and he is getting a lot of use out of them!</li>
    <li> I love the citrus smell!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes. They smell great and I keep them in my car for when I go to markets, etc and I can wipe the handles of the baskets.</li>
    <li> Simple, Light to carry. Good smell. I only use it due to sensitive my nose.</li>
    <li> Smells like a pina colada! Refreshing.</li>
    <li> When you are in the road and need to wash your hands these work great. They have a nice clean fresh scent, and are a must have item for anyone.</li>
    <li> Not good wipes are hard to take out.</li>
    <li> Love these, they smell great and I like that they are gentle enough for skin, but wet enough to use to wipe down the leather furniture.  And even makes my car smell great if I wipe down the dashboard; also doesn&#x27;t leave lint behind like using papertowels etc.</li>
    <li> One of my children has a peanut allergy, Wet Ones were recommended to us by our allergist for effectively removing peanut protein off of things. I LOVE the smell of this citrus one, very clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Great buy, i&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> DON&amp;#34;T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT THEM. THEY ARE GOOD FOR SO MANY THINGS THAT THEY COULD WRITE A BOOK.</li>
    <li> This the most pleasant smelling antibacterial wipes.  We&#x27;ve used this around the office instead of the hand so the place doesn&#x27;t smell like Colox wipes.  Everything cleaned smells so much better.  If you just use it to clean your keyboard, mouse, and monitor you can re-use this a couple of times too.  Just stuff it in a sandwich ziploc. This is a great product for hand or equipment and can clean quite a bit.</li>
    <li> These do a good job of cleaning the crud off of messy hands, but the scent is very strong. Not lemony/citrusy, but very much like pina colada!</li>
    <li> Very handy to keep on desk to clean hands after handling money.  I also use them to clean my computer keyboards, desktop, telephone, door knobs, and pretty much anything anyone touches. I prefer to wash my hands, but these get me by until I can get to the  hand washing area. I like using these more than surface disinfecting wipes because they don&#x27;t feel so harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> The wipes work fine but the lemon scent is horrendous.  I would not recommend or buy again myself just because of the odor.  It is quite unpleasant.  The cost was reasonable.</li>
    <li> I expected this to smell like lemon spray cleaner and was so pleasantly surprised that it actually smells mildly fruity and kind of sweet.</li>
    <li> Smell is more like banana-coconut than citrus, but quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> I like Wet Ones, but this citrus caused an awful skin reaction.  Moral of the story, don&#x27;t buy 8 containers unless you know they won&#x27;t hurt your sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These are certainly wet, but like others have said, they smell funky. Nothing like &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather have the smell of alcohol for antibacterial wipes, because that smell goes away in seconds. The smell of these wipes lasts for a while.&lt;br /&gt;20 minutes after use and I can still smell them when my hands are near my face, like while I&#x27;m eating. Gross.</li>
    <li> Not a citrus smell at all. I was expecting lemon or orange or something.. It smelled like a pi&amp;ntilde;a colada. And the scent was way too overpowering. Also, each sheet that comes out is just saturated. I feel dirtier after using one, like I need to go wash my hands.</li>
    <li> These containers fit perfectly in any car&#x27;s standard drink holder -- and are great to have after pumping gas, eating on the run, sneezing, or any other unsavory occurrence that inevitably occurs when you can&#x27;t find a napkin. I leave them in the car at all times.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I have rosacea and oily skin and I use these wipes to cleans my eyelids, while working later in the day, to sooth a burning sensation and refresh them.  Good for a general face wash.  At home I simply wash my face more often.  I prefer the Citrus as I like the smell.</li>
    <li> THESE CONTAIN CANCER CAUSING PARABENS :(</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Love the smell very general on the hands great for my lilt one that has many allergies I use them to wipe down carriages in stores before I use them! Also great for when the kids are sick..</li>
    <li> What can you say about a well-known brand except EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> These are great wipes. I have used them for a couple of years. My son keeps them in his truck.</li>
    <li> Love these for the kids faces and hands. And they smell great!</li>
    <li> This is a good product - I like the fact that the wipes are safe for hands/face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s opened used. The most disgusting thing is the first used wipe was filled back. NEVER GONNA BUY THIS AGAIN</li>
    <li> Love this to keep in my car!</li>
    <li> I received this in a timely manner--exactly what they stated in my receipt. The wipes are very moist and not dried out at all, which pleases me because the ones I buy at the grocery store are often dried out of moisture, which defeats the purpose of &amp;#34;antibacterial wipes.&amp;#34; This one is surprisingly moist, smells a bit like citrus, and I&#x27;m excited to start using them!</li>
    <li> Not that eco-friendly though.</li>
    <li> Smells good, like maybe pineapple and coconut. They are very wet as well. Some wipes you buy dry out in a short time after being opened. I like the germ killing factor as well.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday use especially with toddlers that touch everything and then want to touch their face.  They do go quick if you use them consistently like I do so a bigger container would be more cost effective..They are great quality and do not rip like some wipes of this kind do..Worth the purchase.</li>
