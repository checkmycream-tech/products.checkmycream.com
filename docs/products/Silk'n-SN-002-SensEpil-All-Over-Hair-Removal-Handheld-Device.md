      <li>Whatever the case, I&#x27;m EXTREMELY happy!</li>
      <li>will say that the hair I tried it on is probably a perfect candidate for the device.</li>
      <li>This was truly the best investment I have ever made.</li>
      <li>and i am impressed.</li>
      <li>Because the product is best used on short-haired/shaved skin, at treatment time I dry-shave each visible hair and then zap its follicle.</li>
      <li>Results are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>It makes me the perfect candidate.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks and the RESULTS ARE AMAZING!!</li>
      <li>I think this product has worked so well for me because I have very fair skin</li>
      <li>Let me start out by saying I am an ideal candidate for this device.</li>
      <li>I cannot explain the reduction in hair growth, it&#x27;s incredible.  </li>
      <li>Good product!</li>
      <li>so I am happy.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m happily continuing this because it is a lot cheaper than going to a clinic</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m having really great results.</li>
      <li>i am so happy that i bought this product and gave it a chance.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for privacy at home</li>
      <li>If that doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;d be happy to purchase another TRIA.</li>
      <li>so I am a great candidate.</li>
      <li>After a year of usage, I can happily say that 90% of my underarm and forearm hair is gone.  </li>
      <li>So, am I happy with the results?</li>
      <li>so I feel great about it.</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>But as it is probably still cheaper than getting it done professionally, I am happy with the product.   </li>
      <li>so, so happy I bought this product.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>The reviews were great for it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll post more when i get my machine and try it out!!</li>
      <li>My best advice is to purchase a used one on eBay, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, they re-sell really easily!</li>
      <li>It is amazing to go weeks without shaving and still have stubble-free legs!</li>
      <li>I purchased this unit through Groupon in March 2012,  amazing deal on this unit with 2 cartridges for $228!</li>
      <li>But that is still awesome for me and much more manageable than the hairy monster I used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It sure is pricey, but DEFINITELY worth it!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I am absolutely thrilled with the results!</li>
      <li>, make sure you wear sunglasses as the flash is very bright.  </li>
      <li>, make sure you wear sunglasses as the flash is very bright.  </li>
      <li>and I never worried about bright laser lights flashing at my eyes unlike this, which lights up the room no matter how close you have it to your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everything is good.</li>
      <li>then I guess this product is good, but if you are looking for permanent results I recommend trying something else.</li>
      <li>I have a fair complexion and medium-brown hair.</li>
      <li>and I can see it in good lighting.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re trying to save some money, and don&#x27;t mind gradual hair reduction over time, than the SensEpil is a good</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re wondering whether it&#x27;s a good idea to buy this thing or not, just do it.</li>
      <li>So i decided if i wanted to get a good idea of how this product works i would turn the amps up to 11.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good but the results need time.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased at this point.</li>
      <li>This is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever used !</li>
      <li>/&gt;Underarms:  Freaking amazing.  </li>
      <li>When you consider the cost of even 1 session at a salon, this is an amazing investment.</li>
      <li>Also freaking amazing.  </li>
      <li>SensEpil has been satisfactory, though to be completely honest</li>
      <li>All in all a wonderful product, I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to get rid of unwanted hair!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, when I ordered this product</li>
      <li>You can do this in the comfort of your own home, whenever you feel like it.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I probably don&#x27;t even need another cartridge.    </li>
      <li>This is Dane Gleesak Signing off, Have a nice day.</li>
      <li>It easy to use, inexpensive way of getting rid of hair and looking great. :)</li>
      <li>but regarding the product, if it sounds too good to be true it probably is!  </li>
      <li>I love my SensEpil! :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this thing and am so glad I bought it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am an ideal candidate for this type of hair removal (very fair, dark hair).</li>
      <li>Ok, I really liked this product, I think it works however here</li>
      <li>I have light skin and brown hair, which makes me a good candidate.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the SensEpil, I am able to use it on the highest setting, admittedly I did burn my skin in a couple places when I replaced the laser, maybe it is stronger when it is new.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with how easy the device is to use</li>
      <li>Another notable is thatthis light is REALLY, REALLY bright.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t think of another good way to discribe this product other then the best out there!</li>
      <li>Very fortunate to know about this and get to use it.</li>
      <li>Have discovered something very important.</li>
      <li>which is very important.</li>
      <li>I am very light completed with light/medium brown hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First off, I am the perfect candidate for this product-- fair skin and dark</li>
      <li>A very light stinging every so often on the more \\&quot;course\\&quot; areas</li>
      <li>Much better than going somewhere &amp; paying to have it done.</li>
      <li>I am ecstatically pleased with this</li>
      <li>The hair removal process requires use over many months.  </li>
      <li>It is now 2/2017 and most of the hair is still gone.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend has even noticed and also loves this thing :)</li>
      <li>to make sure you got all stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it until 3 months  ago.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>Very happy overall!</li>
      <li>I think it more than pays for itself after just one treatment.</li>
      <li>The smallerthe area of the cartridge gun the more pulse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My legs remain smooth for wks!</li>
      <li>But I guess that had more to do with my hair growth cycle than the device.</li>
      <li>i will be using it more often.</li>
      <li>I was able to do 7 legs before the bulb stopped working.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t quite figured out why sometimes it stings more than others</li>
      <li>update after a couple more treatments.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t see many reviews done by men on this product</li>
      <li>I do have to admit, the zaps stung slightly more under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>My forearms are still the parts that sting the most.  </li>
      <li>I have watched the videos and read all of the information the company provides to be sure that I am using it correctly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed in the summer, when my house and skin are warmer, it hurts more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have had my unit for a little over 2 years. I am very light completed with light/medium brown hair. I started just with my legs. After two uses, I noticed a big difference. Then progress became very slow but steady. Now I just do touch ups on a few stray hairs every 3 months or so. About 6 months after I started my legs, I moved onto underarms. One hint, after the first couple of pain free zaps, it starts to hurt. Wait longer than the beep tells you to. It will allow the glass to cool longer. Very happy overall!</li>
    <li> I am a 20 Year old Ghostly Pale white Male, with obscene amounts of body hair virtually every where on my body.  I&#x27;ve been using the Silk&#x27;n SensEpil for about a month now on my Chest/Belly, Underarms, and my Back so far.  I did my first treatment on my Chest on the lowest setting and noticed a little bit of hair loss within a week, let me remind you i&#x27;m a hairy man and my hair grows at rapid rates. So i decided if i wanted to get a good idea of how this product works i would turn the amps up to 11.  On my second treatment i did my chest/belly and my under arms on the highest setting after getting a close shave and two weeks passed and i noticed that my hair has defiantly gotten allot thinner and its falling out just like the instruction manual said.  today i have done my back and am happy with the results i have all ready gotten in such little time.  any who dont let the 1 star reviews get you down or discourage you from trying it.  This is Dane Gleesak Signing off, Have a nice day.</li>
    <li> Its slowly working . I bought this for my underarms because they are super sensitive &amp; my hair grows fast &amp; very dark &amp; coarse . I started out doing as the instructions said every 2 weeks on lowest setting . I didnt see any difference so I started using every week on the highest setting &amp; I have to say 3 months later I do see a difference in the hair . Its much thinner &amp; not as coarse also there are small apreas that there is NO hair ! So I will continue to use every week &amp; keep you updated ever few months . I would not use this on a large area of my body 1st off its very time consuming because it only does a small area at a time like a 1 1/2 inch area  &amp; feels like you are being snapped with a rubber band over and over !  I know I wouldnt want to use this for any large areas just saying :)</li>
    <li> After much research on the internet, and reading some positive reviews, I was very excited to try this product.  Well, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I used the highest setting for four to five treatments and noticed absolutely no change.  I called the company to verify I was using the product properly and I was. Since I was approaching the refund time frame, I was getting concerned I was wasting my money on a product that does not work.  So, I contacted the company and after several phone calls/emails they finally gave me an RMA to send to send it back for a return.  (It was still in the time frame for returns and I had all of the packaging it came with, so I was still eligible for a return.)  Three weeks later, they still have not refunded me.  First they tried to tell me that my package never arrived, but fortunately I had a delivery confirmation to prove that it did.  So they found it and said my refund was being issued that day, a week later, no refund. My emails and messages I left for the company were never responded to.  Finally I got them on the phone and again, they say they can&#x27;t find my information.  I&#x27;m now waiting for another call back.  I will certainly update this when I do receive my refund, but the whole process is very frustrating and since the refund is taking so long now seems shady.....but regarding the product, if it sounds too good to be true it probably is!  I didn&#x27;t notice any changes and I fit the proper profile.  Also, be please be very, very careful with your eyes, the light will go off without a good seal on your skin - even thought the packaging suggests it wont.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at the end of November 2010 and have been using it since, and the results are pretty good I must say.    I bought it basically because I have some hair growing in my chin, pretty thick one and I wanted to get rid of it in the privacy of my home. I started using it in the lower potency, but already the second time, I went up to the level 5, which I have been using since. I tried my bikini line, my under pits and my chin and the results so far are very satisfactory. I have been using it every two weeks in my under pits and bikini line and the hair is growing much thinner and, for example under my under pits, I have notices the hair grow already like 70% less. In my bikini line the hair reduction will be around 60% so far.    &gt;As I said, my \\&quot;main target\\&quot; was my chin, and after chatting with the silknsensepil customer service, I decided to use it once a week in that area, and so far I can say that the hair reduction has been around 50%, but the hair in that area is much thicker than in the rest of my body. So, from my side, I will definitely recommend this product, even though is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I bought the silk&#x27;n sensepil for myself (female, pale skin, dark hair) and used it for the first time during the first week of January 2012...last month. I tried it on my underarms, bikini, legs and this annoying little spot right under my belly button that grows a few dark hairs, bleh.  It really hardly hurts at all, maybe a little bit on the more sensitive area&#x27;s near the bikini line, but the pain is very tolerable, WAY better than pain from waxing. It doesnt take long to do the small areas, but doing my legs felt like it took FOREVER. I had to draw red lines all over my legs to make sure that I zapped every spot. So, because it was such a hassle the first time doing my legs, I decided to just continue treatment to the other 3 area&#x27;s until they were all cleared, or I had more time to do my legs.   After that first treatment, The hair everywhere was growing back alot slower than it normally does. Normally, if I shave in the morning, I&#x27;m prickly by nighttime, and after the first treatment, I wasn&#x27;t prickly until the 3rd day!!! I saw a lot less hair growing back on my underarms and bikini!!! My legs and spot under my belly button didnt seem to look any different, but I could tell it was definitely working on my underarms and bikini.  Since then, I have done 3 more treatments on my underarms, bikini (more like a Brazillian) and the belly button spot, (I did it almost every week...shhh). The hair is still gradually becoming  less and less on my underarms and bikini which is very exciting, however, that stupid small belly button spot refuses to budge...go figure.  Even though Im not completely hairless yet, these small triumphs are ALOT to someone like me, who is used to horrible razer bumps from constant shaving all the time! Oh, and I am still using the first light bulb that it came with!</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit through Groupon in March 2012,  amazing deal on this unit with 2 cartridges for $228! I figured at that price if it didn&#x27;t work for me I could easily sell it to someone who could use it. I have dark hair &amp; slightly olive tone skin so I was pretty confident that it would work for me and I&#x27;m excited to say that I think its working very well. I&#x27;ve done a total of 3 treatments (in 6 weeks) so far and I can tell that the outgrowth of hair on my legs is less than normal. It used to seem that I could shave my legs in the morning and would feel stubble that evening and that is no longer the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first treatment (legs &amp; arm pits) I used the unit on the lowest setting which has little to no discomfort at all. The next 2 treatments I used on level 2 and there is a little more \\&quot;heat\\&quot; with each pulse of light but still not uncomfortable. I did notice a little redness that lasted about 30 mins after treatment, but no pain associated it.  Cartridge life will be significantly decreased the higher strength you use the unit at. I just installed my 3rd cartridge at the very end of my last session. The unit itself seems to be very well constructed and the user manual is pretty easy to follow. It takes me about 30-45 mins to do my legs and arm pits, it almost takes me longer to shave super close before using the unit than actually using it- (I&#x27;m a nail technician and an esthetician I work with told me that a good close shave before using it will be key to getting good results). The cartridges are easy enough to change (although expensive $50 each). The unit isn&#x27;t silent it sounds a little like a hairdryer and it makes a beep to let you know its charged in between each pulse of light. My first treatment the light flash bothered me a little, but now I just look away each time and no problems, but it you have a sensitivity to light you might want to have someone else do it for you so you could completely cover your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those people whohave mentioned the unit not working on a particular area, when the unit indicates the skin is too dark, I&#x27;ve had this happen a few times and my solution has been to turn the handheld part of the unit opposite- either vertical or horizontal of what you had it when it sensed the darker skin and that has always solved the problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the companies website they show a testimonial from G.M.A that was pretty accurate to my experience. I will update again after I&#x27;ve finished a few more months or if my results have changed.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order this. The reviews were great for it and I figured with it being so expensive it must work for that price. I got it in the mail and watched the movie that comes with it and read the manual. When I went to use it the flash didn&#x27;t show with it when it zaps and then every 5th zap exactly it would have an error light come on and I&#x27;d have to restart it. I&#x27;m fair skinned and have dark hair so there is no reason it shouldn&#x27;t work. I tried to call their help number and couldn&#x27;t get ahold of anyone. Then I emailed them and got a message that they will get back to me in 24 hours and they never did. I emailed them again and never heard back. I&#x27;m returning it this week. If the machine works that would be great but the customer service is awful so if yours comes broken you are SOL.</li>
    <li> I had used this more than one year. Need to buy refills always, spent a lot of time and money and it is not work very well. Disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I waited a few months before writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this in July from a QVC special.  I was able to get the entire system as well as 7 light cartridges for 4 payments of $99.99.  The fact I was able to break the payments into 4, made the purchase much easier on my budget.  Although I feel it is a bit pricey, I was contemplating getting laser at a salon and figured this was a smart gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My \\&quot;problem area\\&quot; is my arms.  I have thick hair (with pale skin) and have resorted to shaving them.  I have to shave everyday and although it is not a big deal, I have very sensitive skin.  If I have not exfoliated before shaving I get little red bumps all over.  As you can imagine I don&#x27;t have time to exfoliate every morning!  I have been waiting for a miracle and while this is NOT a complete fix, it has drastically helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the system on the 3rd setting every 2 weeks for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain was not bad at all.  A very light stinging every so often on the more \\&quot;course\\&quot; areas but otherwise bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took 4-5 weeks for me to notice a difference.  But it was a noticeable difference.  I was able to skip a day of shaving and after a few more sessions, I found myself only shaving once a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a 31 day trip to Asia and was unable to take the Silk&#x27;n with me.  For 90% of the trip I remained hair free but, by the end of the trip I was hairier then ever!  When I returned to the U.S.  it took a few sessions to get back on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this product does work, it doesn&#x27;t make you hair free but it significantly reduces the amount of shaving you will be doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My trip to Asia did prove this is going to be a lifetime commitment, A commitment I have no problem sticking to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only gone through 2 cartridges (Keep in mind I am only doing my arms).  I have also come up with a routine to incorporate my zapping with my weekly TV show.  I keep it under my coffee table and pull it out every two weeks in the evening.  I turn on my show and zap away.  I the pain is now non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4 stars because it does not make you hair free forever AND if I had to use this on my legs, bikini, and arms, I think the routine would be a little long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all my Silk&#x27;s has made life a lot less embarrassing and I am a fan for life..  I the pain is now non-existent.  I gave this product 4 stars because it does not make you hair free forever AND if I had to use this on my legs, bikini, and arms, I think the routine would be a little long.  All in all my Silk&#x27;s has made life a lot less embarrassing and I am a fan for life.</li>
    <li> I was asked to come on to the Doctor&#x27;s tv show last year to try the Silk&#x27;n and get one for free. I could not go, because I was pregnant. So... Me and my 2 sister in laws decided to each buy one, off the main Silk&#x27;n website, during the Valentine day sale. It was $499.00 but it came with 4 light cartridges. If you can&#x27;t afford the full price, then you can make monthly payments of $100 til it&#x27;s paid off. Some may find it a problem that you have to keep replacing the light cartridge, which is about $50. With one cartridge I was able to do both my legs (ankle to upper thighs), arms (wrists to elbows), whole face (I have peach fuzz) and both arm pits. I think it more than pays for itself after just one treatment. I had 90% less hair after just one treatment. But, it&#x27;s different for everyone. You must stick to the treatment schedule and do at least 7 treatment to get the full benefits. Trust me, it is the same exact results as in the professional places. My 2 sister in laws have been going for over a year and I got the same result as they did with the Silk&#x27;s. This was truly the best investment I have ever made.</li>
    <li> It works and this is obvious because some areas almost quit growing back. What is left are soft, short, slow growing fine white hairs. After 7 cartridges and 9 months the treated areas are almost hair free. Now I just have to zap the shrinking patches that are left. I have a range of hair colors and thicknesses from brown to blond and fine to course. Fine darker hair areas were fast to go and course or light hair requires more work. Course blond hair is not effected much at all. This is LESS painful than waxing and epilating and well worth not having annoying ingrown hairs with stubble. I use it only on high for cost effectiveness. On high if the window gets hot it hurts a little more so setting it on adjacent skin to cool while waiting for the beep can help make it more comfortable. Very little shaving is needed now and time between shavings has gone from every few days to once a month or less. Though cartridges do cost a bit its been so much better than other methods which aren&#x27;t free either.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing, it really delivers. After a year of usage, I can happily say that 90% of my underarm and forearm hair is gone.  I have been using this device once or twice every month.  Be prepared for excrutiating pain though as the zaps hurt quite a bit. Just do not expect immediate results and be very patient and diligent with the usage.    The only reason this product gets four stars and not five is because you have to purchase the refill cartridges frequently to get the desired level of hair removal.  For instance, I went through 5-7 refills to remove all the hair on my forearm and they are not cheap at $45 per cartridge.  But as it is probably still cheaper than getting it done professionally, I am happy with the product.   One more thing, I know it says to not use it on your face but I do it anyway and I noticed much less facial hair as well.</li>
    <li> You need to use this in a semi-dark room, otherwise the light sensor competes with the light source.  I&#x27;ve used it now for about 5 weeks and am starting to see real results.  Excellent news as I could not afford the thousands of dollars I would have to pay to have this done in a medical facility.  Good product!</li>
    <li> I have been getting in grown hairs from waxing but my hair is painfully coarse in certain areas so not removing it is not an option. I got this thinking it was a long shot but the only alternative was professional laser which is even more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did was shave both sides of the area and just use the sensepil on one side at the second to highest power level. Two weeks later there was a lot less hair on one side than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the hair I tried it on is probably a perfect candidate for the device. It is very dark and my skin is very light. If your hair is really dark and your skin is extremely light, this device might be worth trying.</li>
    <li> This product has worked fine for me.  It takes a lot of time to see results, though.  In the areas where I consistently use it, I&#x27;m seeing much less hair growth.  I have used it for several months and I figure it should take about 6-9 months to see completely hair-free zones.  I&#x27;ve had to buy 2 cartridges and will probably need to buy another 1-2 before it&#x27;s all said and done.  That does add to the cost of hair-removal treatment.  However, I&#x27;m happily continuing this because it is a lot cheaper than going to a clinic and I can use it at home at my convenience.      This product does not work on all skin types, so be sure to read up on it before buying.</li>
    <li> I have always thought time spent shaving legs was a waste, so being able to do it permanently at home appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;Hairs apparently need to be in their growing phase for the system to work, since getting rid of all the hairs may take many months. The unit is easy to use, although some parts of the leg are a little challenging to access. Ask me again in a year how well it has done.</li>
    <li> I have used this only a couple of times, however I can already see a slowing of hair growth.  I am sure over time I will see permanent hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have order this product since 16 of august till today 16 of September I still have receive the product.  So I am very disappointed.  N no happy with everything</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;Because the sound and the light from the machine&lt;br /&gt;And make me filed not safe  and machine it so big&lt;br /&gt;If you going to travel it not conv.&lt;br /&gt;karnda moffit</li>
    <li> I bought this product and replacement lamps and although you can see small result, you would have to shed $40 every second time you use that machine. The description says lamp lasts 750 impulses - that&#x27;s outright lie! If you combine the cost of the machine and the replacement lamp it will cost you more than doing it at the salon. And I am not mentioning your time, because that&#x27;s worth a lot too. At the salon they will do everything fast. Here, with this &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; little SensEpil you would have to spend three time as much time as at the salon, plus you have to do it yourself, it cost more money and you get less result! Final point: Do not buy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, I really liked this product, I think it works however here&#x27;s our short 2 month experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;We both did about 4 sessions, spaced 2 weeks apart. For me, full back, chest. The first 2 sessions all went great, then on 3rd one we observed that with same laser settings, the product head would start randomly cause skin burns, in completely random places. Mind you, it&#x27;s winter time, we&#x27;re absolutely out of suntan and been so since we started this back in January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head protective glass would start to overheat and we could feel the heat in between the pulse discharges even when we moved the head from one spot to another on the skin, you&#x27;d feel the heat from the glass. We had to literally let that glass cool off for more than the 3.5 sec that the machine has built into (when it emits a beep to let you know). The machine has a lot of safety things implemented, one being 3.5 sec in between pulses, technically allowing it to cool off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 4th session, after 15 minutes of use, the head started making some louder popping sounds. As per manufacturer&#x27;s instructions, these should be considered &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;. We really enjoyed that since we thought some hair follicles really got destroyed permanently (yay!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the disaster happened. On next pulse discharge the head unit exploded, an electrical fire started inside the head, the unit started smoking while continuing to make electric flames and explosion sounds. I had to literally rush on and pull the cord from the power outlet before everything would get out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife ended up with a huge skin burn from the disaster and nearly got electroshocked when the laser head exploded and started looking like a welding machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to contact the manufacturer&#x27;s support line. Surprise (or not). Nobody picked up the phone, I was asked after a long wait to leave a phone number so they can call me back. None has so far. I emailed them using their websiteemail address and also using amazon contact form. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sad, paid several hundreds for this unit and it&#x27;s clearly unsafe to use. Im posting pictures with the unit head that caught on fire.</li>
    <li> Love  this  product.  Very  much  worth  the investment.</li>
    <li> This product really is an incredible time and money saver, when you consider the cost of professional laser services.  I started using this product about 6 months ago and I&#x27;m having really great results. I would advise anyone to BE PATIENT.  Permanent hair removal is no small feat!  I use the machine about once a week (or once every other week) on my face, underarms and entire bikini line (more like  the Brazilian regions).  Certain parts are now completely hair free, and some are getting there. I have very dark and course hair (I&#x27;m Egyptian) and have actually done professional laser in the past. Maybe 6 sessions is enough for some people, but many Arab girls I know do laser for years to achieve the results they want.  So I am definitely pleased with the performance of this product, although it takes longer than what you might hope. Just keep doing the treatments, and you WILL get results.  My facial hair has stopped growing back at all and most of my bikini line is smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. The most stubborn hair is under the arm and parts of the Brazilian region.  If you are considering this product, I say go for it. There&#x27;s no way you could do professional laser with this frequency and over this much body area without going broke!  I love my SensEpil! :)</li>
    <li> I decided to get this product over the tria laser because of its larger treatment size and that it doesn&#x27;t need to be charged. So far I&#x27;m happy I chose this because I usually do my arms, legs, hands, and upper lip and that will take me over 30 minutes, which I think is about how long the tria will stay charged. I&#x27;ve completed my third treatment on my upper lip, arms, legs, and hands and the results are quite noticeable.  Usually after shaving I&#x27;ll see stubble the next day and by the third day the stubble is quite noticeable. But now I&#x27;ll shave for the treatment and 2 weeks later without shaving the hair in some areas have still not grown back and in other spots there is hair but light and short, which is very unusual for me.  This means that the treatments are working. I just have to make sure that I don&#x27;t skip areas because I notice that on my legs I can tell what parts I missed. I wish I didn&#x27;t have to continue to buy cartridges as they&#x27;re not cheap but after seeing results I have no choice but to continue through. I gave it 4 stars because you have to continue to buy the pricey cartridges but the product itself really works.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to use and not painful. I have seen results, but you have to do it a few times (over time) to get the results you need. I was recommended this by a friend and have recommended it to others already!</li>
    <li> my 2 daughters and their friends and their mothers started to use now. I have it for three years now and it still works like it was new and I have not changed the strobe bulb yet. I hardly have any hair any longer. If you have very dark skin or very light hair, it may not work. I have dark Asian skin with very black hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t think of another good way to discribe this product other then the best out there! i went to a high end Dr office and paid $2500 for 7 treatments to remove the hair on my face in hopes that the hair would go away but it didn&#x27;t. i didn&#x27;t really have that much hair when i went in to the office but when i was done i had the face of a man&#x27;s. the hair had gotten so thick and visible that it looked as though i had shaved it for a long time! it was my worst nightmare coming true! the Dr told me that i had to do more treatments that laser doesn&#x27;t always get rid of the hair right away. i rememberd what my sister had told me that she did 13 treatments and she still had hair so i knew they just wanted my money. i started to wax and thread my face the hair over time became thinner and a bit less visible but was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my sister bought the Silk&#x27;n  2year ago started using it and she called me 3 weeks later and said mary you have to get this! it works! i told her use it for a few months then if i see that it works i will buy one. after 3 months her hair on her face was gone and we didnt believe our eyes! i bought one from costco because you have 2 years to return it if you have to. after the first use i seen the difference with the hair on my face.after a month i couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes that the hair was practicly gone! after 3 and a half  months with 1 treatment every 2 weeks the hair on my face was mostly gone except for some thin hair that you can&#x27;t even see.i also used it on my arms,under arms and legs i am comletly hairless in all those areas. i gave it to my mom to use it now because i dont use it offten anymore maybe once every 2 months just to do it.  i am so happy that i bought this product and gave it a chance. i am middle eastern bronze skin and black hair that should tell you how dark the hair on my face was. please if you struggle with hair buy the silk&#x27;n sensEpil you wont regret it. costco has a 2 year return no questions asked use it for aslong as you want if it doesnt work you have two years to return it.. thanks bye</li>
    <li> have only used it once. easy to use but too soon to say if it does work.&lt;br /&gt;Will update after a couple more treatments.</li>
    <li> I feel like I have wasted my money on this product. This is total non sense product please dont waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> This is simply an impossible gadget. First you have to shave your legs closely or any other area you wish to treat. Then you have to dry your skin thoroughly. Then you have to use this gizmo. The DVD that came with my unity didn&#x27;t play. I had to go to the website to see how exactly to use it. Once you have shaven your hair, you have to use the unit. It is hard to figure out where the hairs are , so you land up spending hours trying to use this contraption. Yes, it is painless to use on your legs, but it has given me a pain in other parts of my anatomy. Save your money.</li>
    <li> You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck with this machine. I got one of these for Christmas last year. I was excited to use it but I was also pregnant so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it until 3 months  ago. I use it on my under arms, bikini, lower leg, and above my lip. I have been using it every other week. My hair is definitely growing in much lighter and grows in patches now and grows much slower. I have dark hair and light skin so I am a great candidate. I am also one of those women who has to shave every day. Luckily, I can now go longer without shaving and my legs stay smooth which is very important. My husband has commented a few times about how smooth my legs are so I feel great about it. I used to get prickly legs by the end of the day and now I am still smooth next day. It will take time and commitment  but I can see it&#x27;s working so I am happy. Also, it&#x27;s super quick and nearly painless. It&#x27;s much less expensive and less time consuming than going to a salon to get it done so I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with this product. I read ALL instructions, and even watched the DVD prior to using the product. Once I put the cable in the outlet, it does not even turn on. I think it might be the outlet, so I try another, and once again it doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t know if it was the fault of production or the seller, but still-I don&#x27;t buy products just so that they won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> After repeated problems with ingrown hairs, I decided to make the big purchase! Within 2-3 sessions, I noticed the difference! After 3 months, I don&#x27;t even shave once a week. My legs are pretty much hairless. My underarms are about 80-90% hairless. My facial hair above my lip is gone. The bikini area is about 50% gone. It&#x27;s a time saver and I have not had an ingrown hair since!</li>
    <li> I just placed my order but my discount didn&#x27;t apply. I called but got an answering machine. I got a call two days later and the refunded my discount. The rep was friendly and efficient. I hope machine works as well as everyone says.  I&#x27;ll post more when i get my machine and try it out!! Giving three stars until I get machine.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been looking for an affordable product like this for years! Better than epilating and less painful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already had profession Laser Hair Removal on my bikini line, under arms and upper lip at American Laser Hair Removal which all three areas were treated for just over two year (they cut me off even though it was a lifetime guarantee when I purchased) at a cost of over $2K. I still had some dark hair ~5-10% in my bikini area, ~2% in my under arm and ~60% on my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the SensEpil now for about 6 months on my lower and upper legs and have really great results so far. I have ~30% on my lower legs left and ~15% on my upper legs. This has been much faster than I expected compared to ALHR process and results. I&#x27;ve been through 6 light cartridges already, but this is much much much cheaper than the professional salon I was going to before. I&#x27;ve also been touching up areas done at professional place and I&#x27;m now hair-free under my arms and bikini area. The lighter the hair is the more times it requires and so sadly my upper lip still has some hair~10%. I think this product has worked so well for me because I have very fair skin and my hair is dark brown, the areas where the hair is light or blond do not seem to work as well, but I think that is expected. I would recommend this to anyone that has dark hair and light skin, it does work well and is much cheaper than the salon packages, even the ones that are on &#x27;sale&#x27; or groupons deals.</li>
    <li> So after the first use of this product, I&#x27;m marking 4 stars. Keep in mind, that won&#x27;t be accurate until I&#x27;ve had this product a little longer and can verify it actually works. I&#x27;ll update after each use but here are my thoughts as of now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first hair removal product I&#x27;ve ever used, other than shaving with a manual razor. I have a fair complexion and medium-brown hair. My biggest problem was skin irritation and razorburn when shaving my bikini area so basically, I always had to choose whether I wanted a bunch of red bumps or I wanted to be hairy (sounds gross, I know) when wearing a swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had done a little research before the box arrived so I thought I knew what I was doing but once the box arrived, I was nervous so I watched the instructional DVD that came inside. The directions were very clear and I didn&#x27;t have any questions before my first try. My biggest fear was the pain. Most of the reviews compared it to a snapping rubber band, which really scared me so, like it was recommended, I started on the upper part of my legs on the lowest setting. I was freaking out just a little bit before I pulled the trigger for the first time but found that I didn&#x27;t even feel it. I immediately moved the intensity up to the middle setting, 3. I BARELY felt that one and continued to zap my entire thigh and bikini line. After realizing that I experienced pretty much zero pain, I decided to try the highest setting on my other leg and honestly, it wasn&#x27;t a problem at all. I felt it a bit, but it was nowhere near unbearable or uncomfortable. Zapping each tiny block of skin was fairly time consuming but for the hope of forever hair loss, it&#x27;s no big deal. I do have to admit, the zaps stung slightly more under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as hair loss, there are no noticeable differences 2 days after my first use, which is to be expected. My legs were a little red and blotchy in places for a couple hours but again, no big deal. Another notable is thatthis light is REALLY, REALLY bright. The directions say you can just close your eyes before each zap so that&#x27;s what I did. And I really like the fact that this package comes with an extra light cartridge. So far, I&#x27;ve zapped my underarms, bikini line and both legs just from the knee up with no indication that my first light cartridge is &amp;#34;running low&amp;#34;. I suppose if I have success in those areas, it would definitely be worth investing in more light cartridges (if needed) to do any other parts of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to do your next treatment 2 weeks after the first so we&#x27;ll see how this goes and I&#x27;ll keep this review updated!</li>
    <li> Note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the item back&lt;br /&gt;and refunded all the money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after i received the item&lt;br /&gt;it doesnot work at all&lt;br /&gt;i plug it in but its not work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think there is a problem with the item</li>
    <li> This thing does not work right only can use 3 settings my wife has used it an she thinks it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with how easy the device is to use and since I have never owned a hair removal device before I like that it has safety features \\&quot;built in\\&quot; until I get comfortable with using the device.</li>
    <li> Will rereview when I finish the first six weeks. There is a noticeable difference, the finer hair is gone. I am working on the dark coarse hair. That may take a while.</li>
    <li> this item has decreased the growth on my legs!</li>
    <li> I used it consistently, as directed, on my face and underarms. On my underarms I did notice a reduction in hair thickness several weeks after using the device. However, this effect was temporary and all of the hairs grew back the same thickness as before after a couple of months. It had no effect on my upper lip, chin and neck. And I actually am seeing new hair growth on my neck that I never had previously. I dont know whether this is due to the Silk&#x27;n or not, but it is very odd and I am unhappy about it.</li>
    <li> Dose anyone Know how. &#x27;this works on Dark Brown skin</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for a couple of weeks so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving 3 stars! Just not enough use yet to be for sure. But so far I am already noticing much slower hair growth and alot of elimination in some spots. After using it a couple times I have noticed some hair becomes so weak you can barely pull on it and it comes right out. I think it just takes consistency and patience!  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I have gone through about 7 bulbs with this product.  The only spots that I have noticed any change is where I used the strongest setting, which can sometimes hurt.  Even still, it has not gotten rid of the hair.  There are now patches and spots where the hair doesn&#x27;t grow as quickly.  I will go through one more set of bulbs and update this review again.</li>
    <li> I bought my machine through make me heal, BEST DEAL.  I used it 2x a week on my lower legs, big toe, and a few fingers (hate hair anywhere). I have dark brown hair.  If I do not shave for two days or so you definitely can tell. I used the machine and within 2 weeks the hair on my toes and fingers were gone.  Within one month I can go without shaving legs for at least a week or longer.  Still using machine on lower legs to completely get rid of hair.  I started doing bikini area... The only thing that I do not like is after three pulses the next pulse is really hot.  So, i do an area for 3 shots, wait 30 seconds to 1 minute for cartridge to cool off and start again 3x wait 30 seconds, repeat.  But other than that GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I tried the product but returned it within the appropriate period because I was seeing absolutely no difference..  When I purchased it, I also bought a spare lamp.  The lamp unit is good for only so many uses (I forget how many), and then electonically disables itself.  The hair removal process requires use over many months.  This meant I&#x27;d have to spend another $500 on light cartridges.</li>
    <li> After using the product a total of 5 times the color sensor has decided my sun deprived, padty white legs are too dark and will no longer work.  I am trying to decide between returning and trying a replacement or giving up and looking for a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AfterAfterAfterAfterAfterAfter</li>
    <li> I have never left a review for any product before but I had to write one on this product.  I have used this for about 6 months now and I was logging on to buy my first replacement cartridge.  I&#x27;m a man (I know, not very masculine LOL) and I by no means use this on my entire body.  That is probably why my first cartridge lasted so long.    The first thing I have to say is THIS WORKS!  The thing is you need a little bit of patients.  You probably wont see any real results until your 3rd treatment but it is very noticeable.  I have used this product once every two weeks from the day I got it.  Now 6 months later, I can count the amount of hairs I have left in my treatment area.  The only reason I am buying a replacement cartridge is so I can get rid of those last few pesky hairs. Honestly, I probably don&#x27;t even need another cartridge.    The only issue I have with this product is it does sting a lot!  Imagine a rubber band being snapped repeatedly over the area you want to make hair free.  The whole process doesn&#x27;t take long but it&#x27;s not fun while it happens, especially if you are using it on a sensitive area.  But the uncomfortable 5 minutes it takes me to treat my area, it is well worth its results.  Before I purchased this product, I contemplated for quite a while.  Lets face it, this thing isn&#x27;t cheap.  But if you are looking at this review you were probably like me, having hair that really embarrassed or annoyed you.  This was hands down the best investment on myself I have ever made.    The only thing I do recommend is to do a little bit of research on this first, to see if you have the right skin type.  If you have dark skin, this may not work for you.</li>
    <li> Very fortunate to know about this and get to use it. I have thought of getting laser to remove my unwanted hair, but never did jump to it. I brought this in a hurry and didn&#x27;t think much because of the discount I received. I used it 3 times now and got to level 3. Each time the machine will only allow me to use one level at a number of pulses before moving it to the higher level. I didn&#x27;t zap a lot since i just wanted to try it to make sure i don&#x27;t get 3rd degree burn. I love it so far. I have noticed lesser hair and my underarm is 75% reduced. I can see a huge difference. When I did the first treatment my underarm were full of hair and now I can count 15 hairs all even out under the arm. I skip a few straight spot on my legs so when the hairs regrow i can clearly see the area i have zapped and where i have skipped. This is an obvious sign that the machine works. I have a sun tan on my legs but not on any other part of my body that i&#x27;ve zapped (i did on my lip and face too)and i think I had the sun tan because i didn&#x27;t wait over 1 week to rezap my legs, so wait for 1 to 2 weeks between treatment. I even zapped it on my keloid scar at level 1 and it soften it - i didn&#x27;t dare to go higher because i worry i might burn myself and ended up with more keloid scars. But it did soften the scar. It swollen up and turned reddish when I zapped it then after a week the scar level down and has a softer appearance. Depending which angle of the light the scar seem less noticeable. I thought i have to buy more cartridge (from reading the reviews, some have to use 5-7 cartridges) in  order to get some result but for me - asian with light ivory skin - it works pretty fast and i am impressed. I think i have only used 50 pulses out of the 750 pulses. I did some research and the newer refill cartridge is $41 for 1400 pulses and not 750 for $40. The total area to be zapped is bigger than the Remington or other laser pulse machines so at the end the cartridge price is the same. The smallerthe area of the cartridge gun the more pulse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also read about face peeling with laser. So if I have a sun tan from the laser and then peel will my skin look youthful after the peel?</li>
    <li> I got this product about a year and a half ago and it seemed like it was working great at first. I have light skin and dark hair and I used this product on my bikini and underarms. I was so happy because I felt that I had reached that \\&quot;just maintenance\\&quot; point where I would just have to zap an occasional stray hair. BUTTT, after being out of the country for 3 months, I didn&#x27;t have time to do my every 3 week treatments and ALLL of the hair grew back. As in...ALL OF IT. I feel like I just wasted a whole lot of time, money and suffering for no real results.</li>
    <li> That pretty much sums it up nicely.  In order to do -any- laser hair removal, you have to be patient.  I was a little skeptical of all laser hair removal methods simply because I&#x27;ve read so many negative reviews of them, but I decided that it was worth a try to do the in-home ones, since you don&#x27;t have to plunk down tens of thousands of dollars in hair removal clinic visits in order to get the permanent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I read about hair removal is that hair grows in cycles.  This is really important when evaluating this device simply because you have to wait for the hair to grow back in order to be targeted by the laser.  I&#x27;ve been using the device for about 4-5 months now, and I can -definitely- tell exactly where I missed with the laser in previous methods.  My underarm hair itself is noticeably thinner, and the density is less as well, but the most outstanding results are on my legs.  I have fairly fine hair, so it only took about 3 months for 40-50% of the hair on my legs to just stop growing back in altogether.  I&#x27;ve read that it takes about a year to get to 90% hair reduction, so I am definitely on track to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is patience.  If you don&#x27;t have it, this device is not for you.  It -will- take at least a year, and probably a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale skin and dark brown hair, though, so I am pretty much the ideal user.  I am not sure how effective it would be for people with less contrast between their skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people say this product doesn&#x27;t work - perhaps its their skin color, or hair color... But for me, after just the second laser treatment, 1/2 -3/4 of all my hair was already gone. Now, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months (4 laser treatments) and 99% of all my hair is gone!  Perhaps my great results so soon are due to the fact that I purposefully (contrary to what the directions say) started on 3 intensity (instead of starting at 1) and then went to the highest intensity on my second laser treatment.  Whatever the case, I&#x27;m EXTREMELY happy!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 1.5 months now. I treat my lower legs every other week. It seems to be working well thus far. I am starting to see bald patches, about the size of a silver dollar, randomly on my lower legs.  I have had professional IPL treaments on my underarms and bikini line in the past with great results after 8 treatments. I have fair to medium skin (light skin, but tan easily without burning) and dirty blonde hair. It does not hurt near as bad as professional treatments, even on the highest setting. I started out using the highest setting simply because I hoped to see results faster. I&#x27;m certain it will take more treaments than professional IPL to see the same results, but as long as I keep seeing results I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with other posts about eye protection. Even with the device pressed firmly against the skin, the light is still intense. I use it while wearing my indoor tanning goggles just in case. The hubby finds it hilarious, but maintaining my vision is worth being laughed at.</li>
    <li> I bought it about 6 months ago with about three lamps. I was able to use it on my legs for four times once every other week. I did work but unfortunately it does not seem to be permanent. six months later my hair seamed to comeback. My hair was definitely less coarse though. Every replacement lamp cost about 50 dollars and only last for 750 flashes. The price adds up quickly. It is good for small areas but for large areas you need to get about a lamp for every time you have a treatment.</li>
    <li> Already did 3 treatments, 2 weeks appart, on 5th level. I have high tolerance for pain, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, a snap and a little heat. Used it EVERYWHERE: upper lip( taping my lips though, to protect them), sideburns, abdomen, brazillian, legs, arms, armpits, fingers and toes. After 72 hrs after 3rd tx, I could see patches where hair doesn&#x27;t grow. I have to say I have tried wax, I have bad scars from folliculitis from it due to horrible ingrown hairs, shaving made my hair grow in 12 hrs, very coarse stubble, almost razor blade sharp, painful in certain areas. I&#x27;ve had hair since I was 14, now I&#x27;m 36 and I FINALLY afford to do something. NEver tried professional hair removal, way to expensive. This works. Will continue to treat according to plan. Reccomend this vs Tria, I researched all options, tria&#x27;s life is limitted, although cheaper, will use its life in appx one year. The only drawback to Silk&#x27;s is that you have to buy lamps, for a total body tx you use a little less than one lamp, but to me it is worth doing this, I finally found something. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s permanent, but long term works for me, will always use it. One week after 3rd tx and I see only the fine hair on my fingers. I don&#x27;t think the hair will grow finer, but you will see those fine hair that cannot be treated, which you don&#x27;t see when you are very hairy, while the coarser, darker ones in the appropriate growth phase will get killed. I have white skin and light to brown hair, coarser on my legs. silken failed to fire 3 times only, on my tibia;repositioned lamp with no problem; time of treatment max one hour a full body tx; they say tria is time consuming due to battery issues. I haven&#x27;t been paid to review this, I just want to help others who had issues with hair all their lifeand don&#x27;t know what to buy. It is worth the investment.At least it works for me, but you have to be patient and consistent.</li>
    <li> So i read alot of reviews before purchasing this item and despite some negative reviews decided to spend the money.  I&#x27;m glad that I did.  Skin tone:  I have greenish skin, some call it olive, but I completely drain of color in the winter, so I call it green.  I&#x27;m super pale during the winter, but not pink, but I tan really well in the summer.  You&#x27;ll probably know if you have skin like mine. Hair:  Medium to dark brown.  Certainly certain areas are dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 3 months now.  I use it on my underarms, stomach, bikini line, and legs.  I have had to change the bulb once, so I do see how it can get expensive, particularly if you do legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms:  Freaking amazing.  Seriously.  I used to get underarm hair the day after shaving, now it&#x27;s 3-4 days before its shave worthy and I can even go a week.  Some spots are hair free, others are more stubborn.  I do this area every week to two weeks, depending on how much time I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini Line:  Also freaking amazing.  I cannot explain the reduction in hair growth, it&#x27;s incredible.  I am confident that by summer 2013, I won&#x27;t have to shave more than once every few weeks.  I do this area every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stomach/Happy trail:  Meh.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change.  I think its because my stomach hair was not super dark and not super thick to begin with, so I&#x27;m not sure it was worth doing it to begin with.  I do this area every two to four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs:  Works decently.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed reduced hair growth - I shave once a week, as opposed to 2-3 times a week.  That being said, it takes alot of pulses to get your legs done and kills the bulb.  I used to do my legs every two weeks, but now I do them once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note:  I get really bad rashes after I use this.  I haven&#x27;t read about other people getting them, but I did some research and it seems like its kind of common after laser hair removal.  Just a heads up, certainly won&#x27;t deter me from buying again or using, but I am legitimately itchy and bumpy all over for a week.  I&#x27;ve read certain creams can help, but havent tried any yet.</li>
    <li> I was weary at first and did a lot of research on the Trio and SensEpil.  I decided to go with the SensEpil because I wanted to treat the hair on my legs and felt the Trio would take too long.  I am very happy with the SensEpil, I am able to use it on the highest setting, admittedly I did burn my skin in a couple places when I replaced the laser, maybe it is stronger when it is new.  The burns left my skin a little brown for a couple days but there was no permanent damage.  After the sixth treatment, I have less than half the hair on my legs, my hair is dark and course.  I can go three or more days without shaving.  The color of my skin is at the darker end of the acceptable scale, especially when I first started right after summer it triggered the dark skin sensor a couple times.  I had the hair in my armpit professionally lasered three years ago and it cost me $600.  The professional treatment left my skin more irritated than the SensEpil, I needed to ice my skin for about 30 mins after each session at my dermatologists.  I just purchased another replacement cartridge for $35.  I have treated my full legs, bikini, upper lip, chin and a bit of clean up in my armpits about 6 times with the two cartridges that came with the unit.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this machine is hot, not just a light like the last machine that I bought. However, I didn&#x27;t realise that I had to buy new flashes all the time, nor, that they were so expensive. I also didn&#x27;t realise that debit cards aren&#x27;t accepted to buy the flashes with. I don&#x27;t know if it will work yet. I&#x27;ve just started using it. I liked the original price but I don&#x27;t like the short amount of time that the flashes work for or their price. I like the fact that this covers a 2cm square area but would still like it to cover a bigger area because it is time consuming to use.</li>
    <li> I just got this device in the mail today.  I will note that I bought it, 7 days ago and as of today it is $100 more than when I purchased it.  So my review will be based on whether it was worth the $250 I spent on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never done any professional/dermatologist hair removal sessions.  I have only done at home epilators, waxing and depilatory creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, in the beginning the device will only let you use the power setting of \\&quot;1\\&quot; but if you push the \\&quot;+\\&quot; and \\&quot;-\\&quot; buttons at the same time, it will override this.  I would recommend you do this as each bulb has ~750 flashes which doesn&#x27;t changed depending on the power setting, but your results will be better with the higher settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT STINGS!  As I said above, I have never done any professional hair removal sessions so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but I would say it hurts LESS than waxing or epilating.  The good thing was that the sting didn&#x27;t last long.  I haven&#x27;t quite figured out why sometimes it stings more than others (is it using it too many times in a row so that it doesn&#x27;t cool down enough or is it that that particular patch had more little hair follicles ready to grow?).  I did my lower legs, under arms and forearms and the only thing that still stings is my forearms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can definitely smell burning hair, but this too seems to come and go and is never very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be doing the next session in two weeks and will update with any results at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #1:&lt;br /&gt;It has been 4 days since the first treatment and I feel like the hair is regrowing slower than normal.  Clearly, that feeling is very subjective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #2:&lt;br /&gt;This is the second week.  Time for the second treatment.  It still stings :) but since I knew what to expect this time, I don&#x27;t notice it quite as much.  I did the entire treatment on level 4.  My forearms are still the parts that sting the most.  I did feel like the re-growth on my forearms and underarms was considerably slower than normal, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my legs.  I ordered a replacement cartridge, but haven&#x27;t had to replace it yet.  I did run into some issues with lighting this time.  The sensor that tells you whether you skin is too dark will also go off if the lighting is not right (if the lighting is too dim or also if it is bright enough to create a dark shadow when using the device) so I had to move around twice to get the right lighting.  Also (I can&#x27;t remember if I put this in the initial review and I just skimmed but didn&#x27;t see it, so I apologize if  I am redundant), make sure you wear sunglasses as the flash is very bright.  They sell specific glasses on here, but just use your sunglasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #3:&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this section after the third treatment (end of week 4).  It still stings, but I don&#x27;t think it lasts as long and for some reason my forearms still sting the most.  I did the entire treatment on level 5.  The regrowth on my forearms and underarms is definitely longer than prior to using this product.  I still haven&#x27;t had to use the replacement cartridge yet (I am still only doing: forearms, underarms, lower legs).  I didn&#x27;t have as many issues with the sensor saying my skin was too dark this time.  I think it works best if it isn&#x27;t really bright outside, but this continues to be the  most frustrating thing about it.  I think from here I am supposed to wait 4 weeks to treat again.  I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my lower legs.  Perhaps to test it, I should have done one leg and not the other to compare the rate of regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #4:&lt;br /&gt;I am not quite ready for my first one month maintenance treatment, but I will say (finally) my leg hair is growing much, MUCH slower.  I am very pleased at this point.my forearms and underarms was considerably slower than normal, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my legs.  I ordered a replacement cartridge, but haven&#x27;t had to replace it yet.  I did run into some issues with lighting this time.

I am very pleased at this point.</li>
    <li> all i can say do not buy this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since July 2013, other then the expensive cartilages that you have to continuously purchase, I was very excited to see the hair on my legs not growing back after months of treatment. I thought all the hard work and money was well worth it until I cut down on the treatment to once a month. All of a sudden all my dark hair has begun to grow back!! I have since stopped using the device and now I am back to square one. My legs look just like it did before I started using the treatment. If you are willing to sit and zap your legs once every week or so and buy endless cartilages then I guess this product is good, but if you are looking for permanent results I recommend trying something else.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST $200.00 I have ever spent (I purchased one on eBay). After two treatments of my legs, underarms, and bikini area within one week, the amount of hair has reduced about 60%. I have light skin and brown hair, which makes me a good candidate. I used to have to shave EVERY morning. THAT is how quickly my legs would become stubbly. After only two treatments, the hair that used to grow OVERNIGHT now takes about FIVE-SIX DAYS to grow. I am ecstatically pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Settings 1, 2, and 3 don&#x27;t hurt at all, and 4 stings a little bit (tried it for the first time today). Like a small rubber band snapping. But the pain is totally worth it. I understand that it will not work this well for everyone, and I was really skeptical about buying it. But I don&#x27;t have any regrets now! I&#x27;d be content with stopping treatments right now and just shaving once a week. However, I will continue using it (now once every two weeks/as needed instead of 2 times per week) for about a year or until the hair is 100% gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when my 750 zap cartridge ran out, I had only finished one leg (3rd treatment) and after a week of waiting for my new cartridge to arrive, there was a visible difference of about 10% when comparing my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is having to continue buying the zap cartridges. HOWEVER, it is totally worth it if it keeps working this well. I told my mom and she is buying one as well! My best advice is to purchase a used one on eBay, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, they re-sell really easily! So no loss!</li>
    <li> The process of hairremoval takes several treatments over time, so it&#x27;s not complete yet.  I read about the product before purchasing it and it is performing as expected.  I waited a while before offerring a review until I noticed progress.  I&#x27;ve had 3 applications at the lowest setting and after each, it takes longer for hair growth to return.  I have not had any negative side affects.  There was a slight redness on new areas after the procedure but cooling the skin with cold water or ice cleared fixed that.  Putting on makeup after the procedure did cause irritation. I received the product earlier than expected and in new condition.  I would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with unwanted hair most of my life.  I was so excited to save up enough to buy this product.  I have light skin and very dark hair, so I thought I was a good candidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight months later, there is no noticeable change in hair growth.  I have used it every two weeks for that eight months.  I have watched the videos and read all of the information the company provides to be sure that I am using it correctly.  I was not expecting an overnight miracle, but I was hoping to see some effect, especially after using regularly for such a long time.  I am so very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but the results need time. I just keep buying lamps and still have hair in my body but the hair become lighter.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for everyone but my experience with Silk&#x27;n SensEpil has been satisfactory, though to be completely honest I have only used the product a hand full of times but I have done it in the span of a year. I saw results after my very first use, I have done only 3-4 sessions and I was inconsistent with my treatments but I literally have hairless patches on all parts of my body that have been exposed to this device. I haven&#x27;t used it for a few months now and the empty patches are still there. So I am not sure why other&#x27;s have had such a horrible experience. However, the product does specifically state that it works best on lighter complexion skin and dark hair. I am not super light but I am a fairly light complexion, and I definitely have coarse black hair. So ladies or gentleman if you fall into this criteria, don&#x27;t shy away from investing in this product.</li>
    <li> I am a guy, and I got this for my face because I absolutely hate facial hair. For me this was a bit of a hassle in the first place because of having to get a really close shave (which is impossible for my face type without cutting myself) and then using the machine. Well, I&#x27;m really busy so setting aside time is tough.&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin and brown hair, and I&#x27;ve done at least 5 treatments already and I haven&#x27;t noticed a single difference in growth speed or amount of hairs. I would rather just get it lasered off over the course of a year and then not have to worry about it again. Not to mention the fact that all the silkn sensepil does is paralyze the hair and not remove the follicle.&lt;br /&gt;So it was a complete waste of my time and money</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I had previously tried salon laser hair removal, and I&#x27;ve actually gotten better results with this product. Some areas respond more quickly than others, but overall the effect is excellent. I&#x27;ve been using it since July, and am in the touch-up phase for the areas I&#x27;ve treated (bikini, chin, jawline, arms, and stomach). I&#x27;ve done 3-4 treatments on those areas and am just now ordering my next cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain level: very tolerable. I use it on setting 5. To me, it hurts MUCH less than epilating, waxing, and less than the salon treatments that I received. It stings a little more as it gets warm, but even using the term \\&quot;sting\\&quot; to describe the sensation seems a little strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatments are fast - maybe 5 or 10 minutes to do bikini or arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an ideal candidate for this type of hair removal (very fair, dark hair). The darker, coarser hair responds faster. Why the salon treatments didn&#x27;t work for me, I don&#x27;t know. Hair always grew back before the next treatment. I finished 6 treatments (bikini line only) and never saw good results. I was out over $1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for treatment: it takes 2 weeks for the hairs to start to fall out, so you have to be patient. They will continue to look like they are growing during that time. After 2 weeks, the hair will become loose. I usually try to avoid shaving the area after treatment if possible, because at the 2 week mark, you can lightly pluck the loose hairs with your fingers. This helps avoid \\&quot;pepper spots\\&quot; - dead hair in the follicle, which takes a long time to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a previous reviewer commented, this isn&#x27;t going to make you bald as a baby&#x27;s butt in the areas you treat, nor do I expect it to be absolutely permanent. Quite honestly, I think the same could be said for most salon treatments. The areas I have treated are almost to completely hair free, so I&#x27;m ecstatic. When you consider the cost of even 1 session at a salon, this is an amazing investment.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever used ! I used It on my legs bikini arms and under arms, it takes less then an hour!I&#x27;m a big baby with pain but it really doesn&#x27;t hurt , it has a little snap feeling then 2 seconds later nothing.I didn&#x27;t really follow the directions I use it once a week, I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks and the RESULTS ARE AMAZING!! I had really course hair that grew ridiculously fast and it&#x27;s been  week since I&#x27;ve shaved and it&#x27;s barley a stubble!!  I promise this is the product you want, the money is well worth it!!</li>
    <li> I love this system because it is really working!  I have completed about five sessions (one every two weeks) and just started on my second cartridge.  I use it on my legs, underarms and bikini area.  My bikini area is taking a bit longer because the hair is thicker, but the hair on my legs and underarms is pretty fine, and the regrowth has decreased significantly.  I followed instructions and started at the lowest levels, then increased by one level each session.  The fourth session is when the pain started to kick in - but it is like being snapped with a rubber band.  It did leave burn marks on my legs at the 4th level, but that is a small prices to pay for getting rid of hair and never needing to shave again!  The burn marks did not blister and eventually did fade - it just looks weird, like a checkerboard tan line for a week or so.  I much prefer this system over going to a salon where I would have pay much more money, and would be inconvenienced by having to make appointments and leave home to have someone else do what I can so easily do on my own.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product, but I saw a deal on it for about $260, so I went ahead and bought it.  I&#x27;d been thinking about buying one for several years, or going to a professional, so I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to try this.  I was really amazed at the results after about 6 weeks.  I have light to medium skin, but dark, thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my legs and after 4 to 6 weeks, I haven&#x27;t had to shave.  My leg hairs have either not grown back or are very thin and pale, so they aren&#x27;t as noticeable as before.  If I run my hands on my legs, I only feel very light stubble, whereas before it was super bristly if I didn&#x27;t shave.  A few leg hairs have grown back dark like before, but I&#x27;ll just spot treat those areas.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this product on the \\&quot;3\\&quot; setting, but it hasn&#x27;t been too painful.  I like this over the Tria (which I haven&#x27;t tried) because the treatment area is much larger.  In the Tria it seems very small so it would take much longer to treat.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so, so happy I bought this product. If you have the right type of skin/hair combo, this may work very well for you!  (I have not been compensated for this review).</li>
    <li> it was nice the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that i have to shave first then use it if there is a part with hair then it will burn u a bit. but i like it i will be using it more often. oh and it takes a while of permanent results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, when I ordered this product I was sort of expecting to just be flushing $300+ and regretting not going to get laser hair treatments at an actual spa.  But I have been happily surprised to find that after 4 treatments I see a significant reduction in my legs and bikini area.  I just amped up the level to 4 and I think that helped a lot.  I do have the required complexion/hair color for this (pasty white with dark brown hair), so I&#x27;m assuming if you don&#x27;t fall in their guidelines the results would be pretty poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the unit seems to overheat pretty quickly.  I can do my bikini and the bottom half of my leg before it seems to die.  If I wait a day and plug it back in works fine and I can get about the same amount of zaps in.  I&#x27;m assuming this is something I will have to use at least monthly once all the hair is gone to maintain the results, but I will gladly trade shaving daily for 30 minutes of spot treatment here and there.  Seriously, buy this thing!  No pain and quick results!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s started working on my legs. Spots of hair have stopped growing. Facial hair is taking longer.</li>
    <li> My hit that I am treating continues to lighter and thinner and looks to be going away completely in some area. My only complaint is that I wish the charges last longer</li>
    <li> I had tried this machine before because a friend owned and recommended it.  It works really well, but you have to remember to stay out of the sun immediately prior to and after use.  I would say that it is a professional-grade tool like the ones that have been used at doctor&#x27;s offices when I went for hair removal.  so much cheaper and easier to have your own machine!</li>
    <li> After I had done some research online, I decided to choose this device because of the ratings and comments I saw on this. Since I mostly noticed positive feedback, I got the device along with 3 refills. I have very fair skin with dark thick coarse hairs. I am 26 years old and I have been shaving since I was in the fifth grade, you can image how thick my hairs grow by now :/. On top of having very thick hairs grow back, my legs were extremely itchy. I could not stand it! Which is why I rarely shaved because I would shave in the morning and they would be already growing by noon!! Honest to god, this is how fast they would grow. Therefore, I was really eager to try something to help minimize or eliminate my hair growth. Of course I can&#x27;t afford laser hair removal, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a chance. It sure is pricey, but DEFINITELY worth it!!!!!! First you have to shave your legs and then you plug in the device and in about an hr or hr and half you should be done with both legs. I know it&#x27;s a long time but the results are worth EVERY SECOND invested :) After the first 2 uses I DEFINITELY noticed a difference! My legs remain smooth for wks! and the regrowth is ABSOLUTELY barely even there! I am sooooooo grateful for this thing. Results are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using this device for about 2months and do the laser either once a wk or once every other wk. My boyfriend has even noticed and also loves this thing :) He even wants me to try it on his ass!! LOL!!!!!!!!!!! I know it sounds disgusting, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if it works! LOL The only bad thing is that the refill cartridges don&#x27;t last that long. When you put it on the area, you have to wait till a beep goes off and then you push a button on the device and a camera flash-like goes off. The first session only allows you to use it on level 1, but then you can increase it to a max of 5. Overall SUPER invention!!!!:)</li>
    <li> I used this for about 7 months and after about the first 3 I saw  a little reduction in growth and after not much at all.  Id say I had about a 10% reduction overall.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s back and front are now hair free, we both enjoy the results of this product. It easy to use, inexpensive way of getting rid of hair and looking great. :)</li>
    <li> I have had the TRIA before and with that device, had noticeable results very early on and SOME permanent hair removal. So when that one fizzed out, I tried this. I am fair to pink skinned have have red, light brown, brown and black hair. I saw zero improvement on my armpit hair (which was just slow regrowth post-Tria) and is also probably the palest skin and second darkest hair. Same for the upper bikini area, spotty at best. At least with the TRIA the results were 1) fast 2) obvious and 3) semi-permanent even if it IS pricey to replace, it did last and I never worried about bright laser lights flashing at my eyes unlike this, which lights up the room no matter how close you have it to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I also don&#x27;t like spending this much and having zero results, so I purchased a light refill and some carbon (you&#x27;ll see it suggested) to perhaps help define the hair follicles and make them more laser-friendly and I will report back. If that doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;d be happy to purchase another TRIA.</li>
    <li> I started using this in November, so I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now.  At first I didn&#x27;t see anything.  Like, those 2 weeks everyone says where your hair is supposed to just fall out?  Yeah, that didn&#x27;t happen to me, at least not until the third time I used it (so that would have about 6 weeks).  Honestly though, I&#x27;m starting to notice bald patches of hair on my legs now after the 4th use. So if you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix, this isn&#x27;t it. I used the lowest setting on the first 2 treatments, then switched to the 4th setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual session is easy - the most I feel is a tiny stinging if I don&#x27;t get a close enough shave.  Other than that I mainly just feel a bit of warmth.  I&#x27;m on my second cartridge already, the first lasted two treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to mention that I have blonde hair.  It&#x27;s darker blonde though, so I mainly used the device on areas where I have darker hair (like light brown hair).  Oh, and it DOES hurt if you put it over darker skin - I made the mistake of going over a scar accidentally, yeah don&#x27;t do that.  But I feel that as long as your hair isn&#x27;t totally blonde, this can work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after 4 treatments I would say I&#x27;ve seen a significant decrease in hair growth, and some patches of hair look lighter and finer.  I can definitely see the spots that it didn&#x27;t work on yet, they&#x27;re darker and thicker than the rest.  And I can still feel them.  I&#x27;m excited to see what happens in the next few months of use.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying, I haven&#x27;t had the Silk&#x27;n very long, so I don&#x27;t know about long term hair growth. So I&#x27;ll tell you about my experience thus far.&lt;br /&gt;I have light skin (I can tan well in a tanning bed, but I burn in the sun), lots of freckles and light brown hair, but very, very dark and course body hair. As a teen, I would have to shave every 2 days. After I had my child, my hormones must have gone crazy. My body hair got darker, more course and grew LIKE CRAZY. I literally HAD to shave every single day, sometimes twice a day, especially in the summer. Even right after I would shave, you could still see those stubborn black hairs underneath my skin. I cannot stand that prickly feeling recently shaven hair gives either, so I was forced to shave on a daily basis. This includes my full legs, underarms and (not very)happy trail area.&lt;br /&gt;I looked into laser hair removal but it was way out of my price range. I saw the Tria and Silk&#x27;n advertised and was interested, but still out of my price range. Finally, Groupon came to my rescue and had a great deal on this product. I ordered it immediately. I did my first treatment with the Silk&#x27;n on December 18th, 2012. Since then I&#x27;ve diligently kept up with treatments, every 2 weeks per the instructions. So far, I&#x27;ve done 3 treatments on my full legs, 1 treatment on my underarms, and 3 treatments on my happy trail. A few weeks ago, my cartridge beeped to tell me I needed a new one, and since bills come first, I have yet to order a replacement cartridge. So, with all that said, here are my results as of now. My lower leg hair grows a lot slower and it&#x27;s finer. I can now go 3 days without shaving(as opposed to every single day before) and even after those 3 days, the hair really isn&#x27;t all that prickly. My upper leg hair grows slower, but not as slow as the lower leg hair and it is still pretty course. I can go 2 days without shaving my upper legs. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my underarm hair yet, but it was the same way with my legs with only 1 treatment. My happy trail area, is still course, but grows much slower than before. The instructions are correct in that it takes 3-4 treatments to see results. There are 5 settings you can do and I&#x27;ve always used the lowest setting, so I would assume you&#x27;d get faster, better results using a higher setting. I can tell you the lowest setting does not hurt. It&#x27;s like a quick zap of hotness then goes away. I assume the higher the setting, the more painful it&#x27;ll be, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m too chicken to try a higher setting :). So, am I happy with the results? ABSOLUTELY! I cannot even begin to tell you how good it feels not to have to worry about shaving daily and I&#x27;m anticipating summer time now! I do not in any way regret purchasing the Silk&#x27;n. I&#x27;m so glad I went with this at home treatment, versus having to go somewhere to get it done. The only downside would be the cash you have to shell out. I was hoping the cartridge would last longer, but the instructions do say that it would last 1 full body treatment or a 6 small treatments, which seems about right. I am sad because I want so badly to keep going with the treatments and see further hair loss, but I just don&#x27;t have the money to buy a new cartridge right now. If you&#x27;re wondering whether it&#x27;s a good idea to buy this thing or not, just do it. If you&#x27;re tried of shaving, if you have super dark hair, if you have to shave on a daily basis, if you have a lot of body hair, then buy it. You can do this in the comfort of your own home, whenever you feel like it. There really is no downside, other than the price of the cartridges. But really, in my opinion, it is SO worth not having to shave anymore. As soon as I start on my treatments again, I will update my review on the hair loss. It really does work, but only if you have light skin and dark hair. You have to be patient too, because you can only do treatments every 2 weeks. But yes, I will attest, it DOES work. I only wish I&#x27;d taken pictures before and after to show off the results! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product and it&#x27;s easy to use and i love it. It was shipped all the way to Singapore and i&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for privacy at home and i tried it on various areas (mainly for maintenance), from upper lip to under arms, legs (though when i set this to the highest the first time, it leaves only on my legs some slight \\&quot;lesion\\&quot; and light scab so it itches for about a week or slightly longer - but it&#x27;s no big deal to me because it&#x27;s bearable for me), belly, bikini and brazilian. So far it works just fine. If the hair is longer, the ipl sometimes \\&quot;burns\\&quot; the hair away after the first zap.&lt;br /&gt;It is also easy to maintain and clean (i use a soft cloth with a little dvd-cleansing solution).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i think it&#x27;s worth the money for this product.</li>
    <li> There is an update below. This is a funny story.  I bought the SensEpil and began once per week instead of once every two weeks.  I started using the product in September 2012. The directions say not to overlap as you are treating an area.  I started on my legs going in a circle around them spiraling upward.  How do I know it is working? A few weeks later when I looked at my legs I realized I must have been overly cautious not to overlap. I have a spiral of hair growing on my legs.  Now to go back and treat those areas.  Only time will tell if the hair removal is permanent.  Hopefully, I will check back in the future to let you know. In the meantime, I am waiting for the refills to go back on sale so I can purchase more.  It is now 2/2017 and most of the hair is still gone. I can&#x27;t even feel the hair on my legs but I can see a few.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Silk&#x27;n SensEpil for about a year. Bottom line, it works. I used it twice a week at first, then once a week, then once every two weeks, now I use it once a month, if that.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my lower legs, pubic area, underarms and chin. I am Caucasian, of Irish and German ancestry. I have light skin and dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;I always use the highest setting and it stings a little. I&#x27;ve noticed in the summer, when my house and skin are warmer, it hurts more. During the winter it is pretty much painless. It is amazing to go weeks without shaving and still have stubble-free legs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it on my face 3 times. Maybe 50 pulses per time or 150 total, because I have some facial hair, that as a female is unwanted. I&#x27;m tired of waxing and so I purchased this to due in the privacy of my home. Sad to say I&#x27;ve also seen zero results. I have very fair skin and my facial hair is black. It makes me the perfect candidate. If it only wasn&#x27;t working on me I would have given it 2-3 stars but the fact that I did not get as many pulses out of the light as promised was highly disappointing.</li>
    <li> It is my favourite treatment machine.My hairs is slow growth.I am happy and I hope it not growth in next time.</li>
    <li> Burnt my skin pretty badly (at level 3, and I am Asian), and for some reasons, the burnt sin took longer to heal - it must have been the laser beam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried calling (no one answered after a 4-minute hold), left a message, and e-mailing the Company but got no response either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair grew back  thinner, but still, the machine is defective. I do not recommenced this product!</li>
    <li> I used an epilator for 2 1/2 years. Was happy with the results but all the hairs came back in ingrown which left my legs covered with little red spots. I did notice a considerable decrease in hair from the epilator. I got tired of the red spots &amp; saw this on groupon. I have used it every 2 weeks four times &amp; once a month twice. I have used it a total of 6 times over the past few months. I am amazed at how well it is working. I now have less than one hair every square inch or so. About half of the red spots are gone. I expect they will all be gone in a couple of months. As the hairs emerge they get zapped. It&#x27;s a little bit hard to use because you can&#x27;t see exactly where you&#x27;ve been. I don&#x27;t worry about missing a spot. I&#x27;ll just get it next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that surprised me was the need to buy the bulbs. I did not realize there was more expense than the original cost. The bulbs cost close to $40. You are supposed to get 750 shots per bulb. I was able to do 7 legs before the bulb stopped working. The bulb cost is about $10 every time I do my legs. It is well worth the extra expense &amp; I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Much better than going somewhere &amp; paying to have it done. I have medium brown hair &amp; light skin that tans easily. I think the device is only effective if your hair &amp; skin are a compatible color. After using it a few minutes it gets hot &amp; stings so I turn it off &amp; let it cool down. I always use the 5 setting for maximum benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/1/13 Have been using this for several months &amp; am very happy with the results. The hair on my bikini line is gone. Hair on my legs continues to decrease. It takes awhile for all the hairs to go through the growth cycle &amp; come to the surface so you can treat it. Have discovered something very important. The bulb will eventually quit flashing. Don&#x27;t just throw it away. Turn off the machine, let it cool a few minutes, then try again. If it still won&#x27;t work, wait about 30 minutes. I just did that &amp; got about 20 more flashes before it stopped working. I&#x27;ll wait &amp; try again in a few minutes. The bulbs are expensive so be sure it is spent before discarding. Also, keep a record of how many times &amp; areas done so you have an idea when bulb should be spent. I may have thrown away some bulbs with remaining flashes.</li>
    <li> I like it!! It&#x27;s really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I can remove my hair in my home!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really convenient and the price is really cheap compare to other product.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is good.</li>
    <li> so far it seems to be working. when you buy replacement bulbs, find the ones with double pulses. This unit was chosen for the reviews and the larger working area.</li>
    <li> I have been using the SensEpil for a little over two months. I am Italian, and I have very dark hair. My advice - be patient. I am just now starting to see results, my bikini line is getting patchy, and my underarms are now thinning out!  In the winter I plan to start attacking my leg hair (no sunlight on the treated area). You will not see results within the first two treatments, it just won’t happen so stick it out!</li>
    <li> It was not clear to me that this product was coming form Isreal. Aside from the extra shipping timeframe (which was not a huge concern) the product, packaging and instructions are all in Hebrew. I didn&#x27;t feel as though returning was an option because of the return timeframe and the huge expense shipping to Isreal. I have yet to attempt using it.</li>
    <li> I got this a year ago to get rid of unwanted chest hair.  I used it as prescribed for a number of months and noticed that there was a small amount of hair reduction, but it was not incredible and was almost not worth the effort let alone the cost of replacement cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to see what else I could do and found out there is a carbon solution available that can help focus the energy of the light pulse to better target the hair follicle even if the user has light hair (blond or red - for example).  You can find the dye at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004HW8LK8 Avance CRBDYE50ML Carbon Dye 50ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye consists of very fine carbon particles suspended in a very watery solution.  You apply with something like cotton balls, allow it to dry, then wipe it off with a wet rag with some isopropyl alcohol from the surface skin while the rest will be in the follicle to attract the light pulse.  Then you let that dry and do the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try doing the treatment every week to catch hairs that might be in different phases of development.  So, with a combination of getting a little more aggressive with the treatment schedule and using the dye, it seems to be having a noticeable impact!!!&lt;br /&gt;////--------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: July 2013&lt;br /&gt;Now I know for a fact that this thing works! i stopped using it for a couple monthss, and boy did my hair come back.  I had forgotten how much hair I had and how much it bothers me.  So, this thing does really work but I now know that it is NOT permanent hair removal.  It is long-term hair removal, but not permanent.  Given that i have tried every other option possible (laser, wax, cream), this has proven the be the best solution that really works but you have to keep doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As regards the carbon dye, it makes a huge difference in the effectiveness of the treatment.  A lesson learned is that you should cover the area - let it dry - then cover again.  After it dries (and is into thehair follicles), make sure to really clean the surface skin off really well or you can get burns as the pulse light heats up durring the treatment and so the dye won&#x27;t transfer to the surface of the light cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers....</li>
    <li> I used this religiously for a year and a lot of the hair seemed to be gone. I stopped for a few months and now ALL of my hair is back.  I am convinced I have MORE hair now.  I can&#x27;t believe I wasted all that time and money!</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying I am an ideal candidate for this device. I have very fair skin and pitch black hair (my grandma calls me a male version of Snow White.) I&#x27;ve used this product primarily on my chest, stomach, and face. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t want any facial hair, I would just prefer to slow the growth cycle so that I don&#x27;t have to shave so often. I&#x27;ve noticed almost no difference on my face what-so ever, with the exception of a few small spots on my cheeks. I&#x27;m not discourage however, because the instructional video that comes with the product says that it may take up to TWO YEARS for full effects. I would imagine that in general, men&#x27;s facial hair probably would require quite a few more treatments than women&#x27;s body or facial hair before any difference will occur. The Silk&#x27;n website even says that males will likely have to treat their chest area several more times to achieve hair loss, so that most likely applies to the face as well. I noticed no difference at all on my chest or stomach after the first two treatments. After three treatments however, I noticed that there were several patches on my chest and stomach where the hair has either fallen out, not grown back at all, or grown back very slightly. It is possible that I missed a few spots, or that some hairs just require more treatments than others. I would be surprised if after another three or four treatments, there wasn&#x27;t more hair reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does work,for me at least, and is less expensive than professional permanent hair removal. The price you do pay is patience. If you want instant, 100% full hair removal, than this product is not for you. If you&#x27;re trying to save some money, and don&#x27;t mind gradual hair reduction over time, than the SensEpil is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I pretty much have been using this on the highest setting since my first treatment, even though they suggest you start at the lowest setting. I just really wanted to see results ASAP. It feels like a mild shock, followed briefly by a flash of heat on your skin. On some areas on the body, it&#x27;s a barely noticeable sensation. On more sensitive areas, it can be more intense, just use the setting that you are most comfortable with. I definitely recommend using it on the lowest setting for your first few flashes at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.- I would not pay more than $300.00 for this product, I see it constantly going on sale for under that on here and other websites. I paid under $260 for mine on an Amazon sponsored site. The Silk&#x27;N Flash &amp; Go uses the same technology and is sometimes on sale for less than the Sensepil as well. I hear it&#x27;s easier to use on harder to reach and sensitive areas, but covers less of an area per-flash.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I suffer from PCOS and have been battling excessive hair growth for several years.  I have to admit I was very skeptical about buying the sensepil and did a lot of searching/comparing over several months before finally purchasing it.  After only one use I can see a considerable difference.  I have &#x27;stripes&#x27; on my legs of missing hair!  I did get too close to my tattoo on my calf once and I definitely was aware although there is no burn mark or damage to my tattoo.  I have recommended this product to family and friends after seeing my results after just one use.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I would like the light cartridge to last longer as I feel 750 pulses seems to go pretty quickly.  All in all a wonderful product, I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to get rid of unwanted hair!</li>
    <li> It is now February 2013 and I have to say this product does work, but it takes patience.  The only area I&#x27;ve had trouble with it not working is my face.  All other areas--underarms, forearms, legs, bikini area..it works.  The hair isn&#x27;t completely gone, but it&#x27;s finer, doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast, and yes, in some areas it&#x27;s completely gone!  It&#x27;s a work in progress and definitely worth the money.  Do not regret purchasing this product one bit. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Feb. 14, 2014--For a while, it seemed that the hair on my face, legs, and arms was gone by at least 60-70%. It has all come back now, so in the long run, this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two years now, so I think this review may be unique in that respect. I didn&#x27;t read through ALL of the other reviews, but most seem to be for shorter term experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I am the perfect candidate for this product-- fair skin and dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly two years of use as recommended (every two weeks at first, then every three weeks, etc.) I am using the unit about once a month to hit stray leg hairs and do full armpit treatments. I make sure I do the treatments on skin that is dry and bare (no lotions or deodorant applied). A slight drawback is that I need to allow my leg hair to grow between treatments so I can see where I need to treat. Because the product is best used on short-haired/shaved skin, at treatment time I dry-shave each visible hair and then zap its follicle. This is the only way to see what areas still need to be treated. If you continue to shave between treatments to get the hairs that remain, you&#x27;d have to treat your entire leg each time ($!) to make sure you got all stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seemingly removed about 50% of my underarm hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have seemingly removed about 75% of my upper leg hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have seemingly removed about 85% of my lower leg hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have seemingly removed about 75% of my bikini line hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for absolutely bare legs with no fine hair visible in strong sunlight profile views, this is not your product. The hair that does remain on my legs is finer and seems lighter in color, but it&#x27;s there and I can see it in good lighting. My legs feel smooth and you&#x27;d have to look closely at them to see the hair, so it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say \\&quot;seemingly\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t know what will happen if I cease to use the product. I suspect the hair will all eventually grow back, as I&#x27;ve read that there really is no such thing as permanent hair removal. For now I&#x27;m content with continuing to buy the (expensive!) cartridges because of the time I save on shaving my legs. I still feel the need to shave my underarms every day. The cartridges last much much longer now that I&#x27;m not treating my entire legs, so that&#x27;s a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the \\&quot;800\\&quot; number to see if the cartridges from the pink retail version (this one) and the giant warehouse store aqua version (name withheld so this review isn&#x27;t censored) are inter-changeable, and the answer I got was very unsatisfactory. I suspect it&#x27;s a marketing difference only, as the rep could only keep saying that the retail cartridge would work, but was \\&quot;formulated differently\\&quot;. She couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t expound on this. I verified that the pulses were the same in strength and number, and the cartridge is physically identical, so I don&#x27;t know what other differences there could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a \\&quot;3\\&quot; because it does technically work, but it&#x27;s not the miracle quick hair removal system some marketing campaigns make it out to be. It takes long-term dedication and cartridge purchasing. The real test would be to see how fast all of the hair grows back, but I&#x27;m not about to test that after investing the time and money I have to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review update: I failed to mention that I used the unit at its maximum strength (5) pretty much from the start. You can bypass the first 50 pulses of lower strength by following the directions they give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review update 2014: I have now used this product for over 3 years. I upgraded my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars because not only is the machine still working OK, but the hair isn&#x27;t growing back for the most part, so I&#x27;m only doing spot treatments every 2 - 3 months. The percentage of hair removal I mention above is now 70% underarm, 90% upper leg, 95% lower leg, and 85% bikini line. Now that the price seems to have come down substantially I would highly recommend this method to anyone who is willing to work with it long term.</li>
    <li> I have been using this over an 8 month period and have used it 10 times and I have seen dramatic results. I used it on my bikini line, arm pits and belly area. Unfortunately, my legs are too tan so I cannot use it there. I am absolutely thrilled with the results! I was seriously considering getting professional treatments which would have cost me a couple thousand dollars. But I decided to try this instead and figured I&#x27;d only be out a couple hundred if it didn&#x27;t work. Plus since I bought it at Costco, I could return it if I didn&#x27;t like it. It seemed like a no brainer to me.&lt;br /&gt;I started seeing results after maybe the 3rd or 4th treatment. And then half way through, I was kind of worrying that it seemed like my hair situation was relapsing. But I guess that had more to do with my hair growth cycle than the device. I should have taken some before and after pictures. But the results are dramatic. I absolutely love this thing and am so glad I bought it! The only thing is that it seems like my arm pit hairs are more stubborn than my bikini line for some reason. I still get 10-15% hair growth on my bikini line, 20% on my armpits and 2% on my belly area. But that is still awesome for me and much more manageable than the hairy monster I used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tan easily which is why I can&#x27;t do my legs, but for other parts of me that don&#x27;t see much sun, this works great. Although, I do consistently get the sensor warning going off when I do my armpits which doesn&#x27;t make any sense since my armpits are as pale as can be. I just move it to another part of my body and then when it starts working again, I go back to my armpits and then it works. So the system is a bit finicky but for results like these, it&#x27;s a small nuisance that I am willing to put up with. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My wife and I purchased Silk&#x27;n sensEpil to try and get rid of unwanted hair. We have each used it three times.&lt;br /&gt;How it has worked for my wife. She has used it on her legs on which after one use she has had limited growth come back on her thighs. Slower regrowth on her lower legs. Down in womans land, she has not seen much difference yet, but will keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;She had a few problem hairs on her chin which seem to be gone now. She use to go to electrolysis and have her underarms done, so there is already no growth of hair, so she doesn&#x27;t have to use it on this part of her body.&lt;br /&gt;Now as for me I am using it on everything except my chest and lower arms. First let me say it does take some time and we are going thru the lamps pretty quickly. But I figure if it gets rid of all of my body hair, and I don&#x27;t have to shave everything everyday, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;As of now the hair on my legs seems to be growing back slower. I don&#x27;t need to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;Down in man land it is still about the same, maybe a little less.&lt;br /&gt;My stomach, back side,(back and butt), and shoulders are definitely seeing less hair. My underarms and upper arms, which I have too admit, I have done several times because it is quick to do, have seen the most improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see many reviews done by men on this product so I hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;I will update on how it is going in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> After using this procuct on my lower legs, I began to develop HORRIBLE peri-follicular edema (folliculitis).  My lower extremeties appeared to be covered in hives and were intensely itchy within 12hrs of treatment. My under arms and bikini line did not develop this reaction (thankfully), but the lower legs certainly did and required treatment with oral steroids.  I have found no reviews this far from anyone with similar reactions, however did find a research article from overseas that documented multiple cases of similar.  I then attempted a patch test with a lower intensity, yet still had the reaction.  As for the other areas I&#x27;ve treated, I have seen great results and plan to continue use.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this at first, but after using, I&#x27;m sold.  I bought it from Groupon for $269.  After 2 treatments on my legs at full power, hair is almost completely gone &gt;90%. My armpit hair was gone after 1 treatment. Working on a brazilian, but it is taking longer because I cannot tolerate the pain of the highest setting. Does hurt, but tolerable.  Hurts more as it warms up.  Would suggest doing most sensitive spots first.  Debated between Tria and this but went with Sens epil because it covered a larger area and you can buy refill catridges.  They do go quickly.  I have light skin with dark brown hair. Very tedious, so set aside the time to do it so you&#x27;re not rushed and you don&#x27;t miss spots.  Worth it.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in used condition because I was worried whether it would work for me. I have dark, coarse hair on my legs and underarms that was fast growing. I could shave in the morning and by the evening have nasty stubble. I was self-conscious about it and really didn&#x27;t expect anything to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the SensEpil twice now - and I am VERY VERY happy! I used it on my (full) legs, underarms, and bikini line. My legs are so much smoother - even a couple of days later! I have very little &#x27;five o&#x27;clock shadow&#x27; on my underarms - they look great! A couple of days may not sound like much, but if you knew how bad it was before I tried this you would understand. The first time I used it at the second strength setting; the second time at the fourth setting. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after several uses!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;It WORKS&lt;br /&gt;Privacy (bikini area)&lt;br /&gt;Nice smooth skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Plan about 45 min to 1 hour for one treatment (both full legs, underarms, bikini)(But SO worth it)&lt;br /&gt;Stings a little - like a little electric zap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 4-stars only because I don&#x27;t know the long-term outcome - will this eventually be permanent or will I need to do this regularly? Also, don&#x27;t know what the overall cost will be to maintain. Otherwise, I fully recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if you are considering this product you need to fit a certain profile (not dark skinned, and not gray hair) for it to work.</li>
