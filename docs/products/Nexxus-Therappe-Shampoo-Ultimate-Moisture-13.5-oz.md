      <li>My hair is definitely softer and more manageable.</li>

      <li>and I cannot believe how much $$ some people will spend on shampoo!</li>
      <li>This product cleans it, tames it, rinses out very well, and almost can be used without conditioner!</li>
      <li>This is a great shampoo that keeps my dry, short, curly hair in check.</li>

      <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is much smoother and softer since she began using this and the matching conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo for keeping my hair moist after shampooing.  </li>
      <li>It takes little shampoo to create a rich luxurious lather that   leaves hair shiny clean.</li>
      <li>Lost faith when they changed the smell of some of the tried and true, but this shampoo has remained the same.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is not over-powering, as I am very sensitive to smells, and you don&#x27;t need much of the product to produce the amount necessary to clean your hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo combination has helped restore my hair to a better shine and less dryness.  </li>
      <li>On top of that, I can hardly smell it, even right after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I use the Keraphix as a leave in, as well as a normal conditioner.</li>

      <li>It is often less and free 2 day shipping with Prime, and I add to my cart and it is here in 2 days.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is the super strong coconut smell.</li>
      <li>wow.. is my hair soft!</li>
      <li>The price is fairly high compared to other brands but it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>I thought I was ADD or something because I had not recalled looking in my palm to squeeze shampoo and seeing clear</li>
      <li>It also makes it shiny and so soft.</li>
      <li>But with the Nexxus shampoo, our hair feels soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and with body.</li>
      <li>hair is really shiny, soft and silky and the shampoo is not too heavy for my hair like most other moisturizing shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>but I have a lot of it, that my water is soft, or that I do not wash my hair very often, because it is so dry.</li>
      <li>This is a concentrate formula, so you will use less than most other brands.</li>
      <li>Works very well when I have long or even short hair!</li>
      <li>I have tried many shampoos and this one did the trick on my dry and dull hair</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and full, nothing negative to say, I&#x27;m now a lifetime customer!</li>
      <li>If you already like this shampoo, Amazon Prime is a good place to buy it because it is much less expensive here.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo gives my hair just the right amount of moisture that I can get a pick through it when it&#x27;s wet but not weigh it down.</li>

<li> Seriously when I got it first off it was not sealed which made me hesitant , 2nd it was leaking !</li>
<li> Pretty sure this is fake, the smell is not great.</li>
<li> A few days ago I washed my hair and noticed the shampoo came out clear.</li>
<li> My hair is long, color-treated, wavy/curly</li>
<li> I did… and out came half clear half milky white.</li>
<li> would recommend this shampoo to anyone who is having difficulty with dry hair.</li>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this shampoo for years and decided to try it again after using Herbal Essences shampoo with silicone that I could hardly wash out of my hair, terrible.  I love this Nexxus shampoo and do not find that it leaves any build up.  Leaves my hair and scalp feel very clean and makes my hair soft and shiny.  Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> If you already like this shampoo, Amazon Prime is a good place to buy it because it is much less expensive here.  I have started to buy more and more drug store and grocery store items on Amazon.  I have the app on my phone, and often when shopping in brick and mortar, I will use the app to scan the item and check Amazon&#x27;s price.  It is often less and free 2 day shipping with Prime, and I add to my cart and it is here in 2 days.  This shampoo is super rich and a little bit goes a long way for making luxurious suds.</li>
    <li> this is a great product,my only problem is that it was very drying to my hair,it was woth a try though</li>
    <li> this shampoo is the bomb! It takes little shampoo to create a rich luxurious lather that   leaves hair shiny clean. And it has a lushes coconut scent.</li>
    <li> I have used another very good shampoo for years and still feel that it&#x27;s a great product, however, after reading reviews for the Nexxus Therappe Shampoo, I decided to try a new shampoo. I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not over-powering, as I am very sensitive to smells, and you don&#x27;t need much of the product to produce the amount necessary to clean your hair. I will definitely buy this shampoo again and am very glad I decided to try it.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo for keeping my hair moist after shampooing.  Living in a dry climate I need something like this.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> The product formula was as expected. This is a concentrate formula, so you will use less than most other brands.</li>
    <li> I loved it since I got it in October. Since last week I noticed that my hair was getting oily within two days which has never happened before. A few days ago I washed my hair and noticed the shampoo came out clear. I thought I was ADD or something because I had not recalled looking in my palm to squeeze shampoo and seeing clear… I thought it was white. Again super oily hair… today… just now… I thought I would shake the bottle. I did… and out came half clear half milky white. So no pranks in this house as my husband would never dare mess with my hair… it&#x27;s the product. I want a refund!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. Especially after I have had my hair lightened and hi lighted. It restores the moisture and keeps it nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo by Nexxus.  The price is fairly high compared to other brands but it is worth it.  I enjoy this Therappe Ultimate Moisture shampoo very much and will continue to buy it.  Works very well when I have long or even short hair!</li>
    <li> Very good quality for dry hair!</li>
    <li> This works wonders. My mother and I use this shampoo and we have different kinds of hair. Mine is thick and frizzy all the time, while hers is thin and smooth. But with the Nexxus shampoo, our hair feels soft and shiny. We both have dyed hair and it actually brings out those colors too.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner and my hair turns out shiny and nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been frosting my hair for years and using this product for years.  Between this and Nexxus Humectress my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel processed.</li>
    <li> I took the chance with this purchase and I have to say it is absolutely brilliant on extensions. Other shampoos, such as Aveda I found to be a bit harsh on my extension.  I think I have came across a gem.</li>
    <li> wow.. is my hair soft! I love the smell and my hair has never been softer. I have tried many shampoos and this one did the trick on my dry and dull hair</li>
    <li> one of the best thickening shampoos for thin hair.. prompt service.</li>
    <li> Borrowed this from a girlfriend while on vacation. Hydrating and great shine!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is marketed to give nutrients to your hair but in reality it&#x27;s damaging your hair. This shampoo has Sodium Laureth Sulfate ingredient which is known to be cancer causing while it may you bald one day. You want healthy hair, avoid shampoos with this ingredient Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/Sodium Laureth Sulfate.</li>
    <li> I like Nexxus therappe shampoo, but I got two shampoo without moisturizing. I don&#x27;t think I ordered 2 shampoo. I did order one shampoo and one Moisturizing</li>
    <li> The bottle in the picture says “Ultimate Moisture” However, the description says &amp;#34;Luxurious Moisturizing.&amp;#34;  The bottle I received says “Ultimate Moisture” Did we have a name change or what?&lt;br /&gt;If you wash your hair every day, this shampoo will be great. But, if you are a once-a- week shampooer, you will find that your hair will look oily about half way through the week. I have very dry hair and my hair still looks slightly oily after a few days. I do shake the bottle each time I use it and the shampoo is thick.&lt;br /&gt;There must be several kinds of Nexxus Therappe Shampoo. When I started using Therappe shampoo many, many years ago, I guess there was only one kind, and it was wonderful! Next time, I will try to find the original Nexxus Therappe shampoo, if it still exists!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in YEARS.  Leaves my hair soft and full, nothing negative to say, I&#x27;m now a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> Seriously when I got it first off it was not sealed which made me hesitant , 2nd it was leaking !</li>
    <li> Above average shampoo.  Leaves hair clean and looking good.</li>
    <li> Once you try this shampoo, you&#x27;ll find yourself buying it again. I switch around using different products to experiment, but Nexxus Therappe is one I do buy again and again. My hair is long, color-treated, wavy/curly and I&#x27;m always fighting to cover up a crop of those wiry grays that seem to be made out of anything but my own hair. This product cleans it, tames it, rinses out very well, and almost can be used without conditioner! (That&#x27;s saying a lot for my hair.) Recommended!</li>
    <li> love the smell of the shampoo</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and this shampoo works well.  Leaves my hair soft and with body.</li>
    <li> It seems they have changed the formula -- I have returned 2 of the larger bottles.  This size seems better, but I am still having to shake it before I use it.  Not thrilled with Nexxus at this point.  I have been using this brand since about 2000.</li>
    <li> I love the coconut smell!</li>
    <li> The Box with the TWO SHAMPOO Came But the Outher Box was empty sorry it was all rip open down the side</li>
    <li> I have thick, long hair past my waist.  I blow dry and flat-iron every other day.  This shampoo and conditioner combined make my hair silky smooth like in the magazines and on commercials.  I also use Paul Mitchell super skinny serum and &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; spray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo before and loved it then. I have fine hair but a lot of it so it tangles up easily. This shampoo gives my hair just the right amount of moisture that I can get a pick through it when it&#x27;s wet but not weigh it down. It also makes it shiny and so soft. I would have given it 5 stars but I think it&#x27;s a little expensive or I would buy it more often.</li>
    <li> My hair is really fine, and pretty damaged from the bleach, dye, bleach, dye routine, and from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I used this shampoo for the first time last night. I do not love the smell out of the bottle, but I do not understand the whole beauty industry&#x27;s obsession with coconut smelling shampoo and conditioner. Once I washed my hair with it, the smell is better.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really shiny, soft and silky and the shampoo is not too heavy for my hair like most other moisturizing shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and smells like I went to the salon to get it washed and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a good amount of this to wash my hair.. maybe because my hair is fine but I have a lot of it, that my water is soft, or that I do not wash my hair very often, because it is so dry.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this is fake, the smell is not great.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is much smoother and softer since she began using this and the matching conditioner.  She has thick wavy blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo my hair is soft and shinny easy to style, I am sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;&#x27;ve used Nexxus products for years. Lost faith when they changed the smell of some of the tried and true, but this shampoo has remained the same. I use this along with Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner. Any issues you may have with damage to hair can be remedied with these 2 products. I use the Keraphix as a leave in, as well as a normal conditioner. Your hair will smell like a vacation.</li>
    <li> Has a wonderful smell and feels great on my hair. I also started using a Nexxus conditioner, and it&#x27;s hard to differentiate which product did what to my hair. My hair is definitely softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I was searching for Humectress shampoo and not really finding it so gambled that the Nexxus Therappe Shampoo would be a good substitute.  I live in a cold, dry climate and my hair was not behaving properly in that it was getting dry and frizzy and the conditioner I was using wasn&#x27;t doing the job.  This shampoo combination has helped restore my hair to a better shine and less dryness.  I only need a very small amount - about the size of one or two peas to shampoo with lots of suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who is having difficulty with dry hair.</li>
    <li> Been using for two months, went back to Pantene to see the difference. And man was it huge. My hair seemed to knot up easier and wasn&#x27;t has smooth as the Nexxus. Love this brand, hair seems good and feels great. Can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair again.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo.  Lathers good and leaves hair soft.  I have used other brands but like this best.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo that keeps my dry, short, curly hair in check. On top of that, I can hardly smell it, even right after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> Fount the shampoo excellent for my hair. Great stuff!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic! Brought my hair back to life and great to use daily. Highly recommend this shampoo. Amazon prices are much better than local salons as well. My entire family enjoys this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super cheap when it comes to every day products like shampoo.  I&#x27;m a Pantene 2-in-1 girl, when its on sale. My hair has been looking a little crazy lately, so I decided to give this a shot. I like it. I did some research on the best shampoos and I cannot believe how much $$ some people will spend on shampoo! So in retrospect I guess that this isn&#x27;t that expensive. My only complaint is the super strong coconut smell.</li>
    <li> Product leaked and lost a great deal in transportation</li>
    <li> The shampoo is really thick, almost gooey. I don&#x27;t mind because it still lathers on my hair just fine. I use this product every other day and my hair still smells like coconut after a day without shampooing. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong, overpowering smell, which I like.</li>
    <li> The shampoo itself is fantastic, but the bottle shape makes it hard to let it stand head side down... Therefore I would not buy it again...</li>
    <li> It has always done a good job for me and I prefer the smaller bottle! It is also cheaper than buying at a beauty products store.</li>
