    <li> Really Nice Product. Thank You For The Wonderful Service.</li>
    <li> I love this pen so much! I enjoyed how smooth and easy!!  makes your eyes sexy and smoky! Get it if you are trying to find a good eyeliner! I wish there was a sharpener with it to sharp it after many times of use.</li>
    <li> not waterproof.. and it smudged my eyes..dont get it if you want a clean/thin eye line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;char char char char char char char</li>
    <li> Eye pencil is my most used makeup item, after foundation. These are great. First of all, it&#x27;s a great deal. Secondly, the sponge in the other end of the pencil is perfect for blending any mistakes or just for the sake of blending. One problem, it doesn&#x27;t sharpen well in the pencil sharpener. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my old sharpener or the pencil though.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s too bad.it can smudge my eyes.it can&#x27;t be waterproof.my eyes is oily,i used that just one hour,then my eyes was smudged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for as long as I can remember - the pencil goes on smooth and the built in smudger tip is a necessity! Love love love these!</li>
    <li> I bought this liner because I needed a good one and I was not dissapointed.  Easyto apply and sstays on.</li>
    <li> CoverGirl Perfect Blend Pencil Basic Black(N) 100, (Pack of 2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blends easily&lt;br /&gt;nice black color&lt;br /&gt;not too dark,smooth and not shiny</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t usually say things like &#x27;must-have&#x27; -- but this eyeliner pencil is a standard and a fixture in my makeup kit.  It glides on smoothly and has a great little smudgey sponge at the end that&#x27;s good for a smoky eye.  I used to use MAC eye pencils -- but those ones always seem to break on me and at $14 a pencil -- that&#x27;s pretty ridiculous.  These are great and definitely [and cost effectively] do the job!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is so nice. It goes on very smoothly, and works better than even some MAC eyeliners! You may need to warm it up in your hands sometimes, but that isn&#x27;t exactly a problem for me. The blending tip at the end works pretty nicely, too. I wear this every day, and refuse to get any other brand now.</li>
    <li> This is one of the rare times I have a reaction to an eye pencil. Made my eyes itch like crazy both times i wore it. I had to give it away.</li>
    <li> I started using this particular brand of eye pencil when I was in my twenty&#x27;s.  I am now 60.  For 40 years it has been my best friend.  No other pencil is as gentle to the eye when using it.  You do not need to pull or push the pencil or your eye to use it, so, you don&#x27;t damage the eye tissue creating lines or aging your eyes.  I live in Canada and could get it in my own stores here, but now I need to order it.  I am just glad that I was able to find it.  I thought that it had been discontinued completely, so I am ecstatic that I can get it through Amazon.com.  Thank you Amazon, you have now become my new best friend!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the little smudge brush as much as I do. It&#x27;s a great little tool for blending the liner in with eyeshadow. No complaints!</li>
    <li> The eye liner is smooth to apply and not as harsh as some I have tried. It also blends really well for the smoky eye look. A great addition to your purse.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner.  I have purchase numerous eyeliners that cost 4 to 5 times as much as this one but I always go back to this.  It is very soft &amp; easy to blend.  It does not irritate my sensitive eyes whatsoever.  I like to line the inner rim &amp; this goes on so smooth &amp; dark with no irritation.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for;  I love how easily it goes on and how nicely it blends.  I might try the brown next.</li>
    <li> When these were on sale I should have purchased more.  I really like this eyeliner pencil and the smudge end is very useful.  I had no issues with smearing or anything, and stays pretty much most of the day.  I also like the fact that the black color isn&#x27;t VERY black, and it looks more natural than some black eyeliner pencils.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on smooth and the color is intense enough. It doesn&#x27;t have the greatest staying power in the world, however it is much better than those stick eyeliners you buy for 99 cents. Yes, I will get them again.</li>
    <li> Getting two eyeliners for less than the price of one at regular stores is a great deal. Package came quick and product was as pictured. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite eye liner for more then 10yrs. It glides on smoothly without clumping. It&#x27;s very easy to blend with the blending tip</li>
