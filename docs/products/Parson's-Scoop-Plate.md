      <li>The curved rim is awesome, but the no-slide bottom doesn&#x27;t work that great.</li>
      <li>Although pictured with a person using a fork, this plate is great for finger foods too.  </li>
      <li>Have been using for five months and still in good shape.</li>
      <li>but it was good.</li>
      <li>For anyone who has a special needs child these plates are awesome!</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t work for my husband, maybe because of limited vision he can&#x27;t see where the raised side is.</li>

<li> I take this plate with me to dinner at other people&#x27;s houses...</li>
<li> My son is messy when hes eating, so I would like the plate more if the grippy part around the base of the plate was a little stronger.</li>
<li> does not fit my husbands needs</li>
<li> Was somewhat doubtful how it would work since the plate is fairly light, being made of plastic.  </li>
<li> but to small for cereal or soup.</li>
<li> Nothing wrong with the product</li>
<li> I also don&#x27;t recommend cutting food in the plate, it will show scratch marks eventually.</li>

    <li> My favorite dish. Really works!</li>
    <li> For anyone who has a special needs child these plates are awesome! My granddaughter can eat on her own now and enjoy the freedom and success thanks to this plate.</li>
    <li> Great, non-slip base.  Side helps sister to keep food ON the plate and transfer to the fork easier. Don&#x27;t mind hand washing once in a while.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t work for my husband, maybe because of limited vision he can&#x27;t see where the raised side is. Nothing wrong with the product but it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
    <li> Was purchased for a person with Parkinson&#x27;s who had difficulty keeping food on a regular plate while eating.  Was somewhat doubtful how it would work since the plate is fairly light, being made of plastic.  However, have used for about 2 weeks and am very satisfied ... food spillage from the dinner plate was almost completely eliminated; it is definitely a noticeable improvement.</li>
    <li> These plates work ok but they stain easily</li>
    <li> I bought this plate for my son who has some developmental delays. The curved rim is awesome, but the no-slide bottom doesn&#x27;t work that great. My son is messy when hes eating, so I would like the plate more if the grippy part around the base of the plate was a little stronger.</li>
    <li> Looks just like pictures, works well for my mother who had a stroke and can only use 1 hand.</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to order more of these plates!!  Although pictured with a person using a fork, this plate is great for finger foods too.  My son is able to finger feed himself his favoite snacks like cheetoes &amp; froot loops.  Without this plate his snacks would be in his lap! Be careful with the dishwasher temperature, the rubber ring on the bottom will fall off.  I also don&#x27;t recommend cutting food in the plate, it will show scratch marks eventually.</li>
    <li> This bowl is fabulous! I think it&#x27;s the first time we&#x27;ve had dinner without a pile of food at the edge on the plate at the end of the meal. It really works great. Even better than I hoped. A great investment!</li>
    <li> This plate has made eating by my husband much easier.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  I now have two.  Usi ng it with the correct utensils has made my husbands dining experience much better.</li>
    <li> It is good for small items-ice cream, fruit etc. but to small for cereal or soup.</li>
    <li> does not fit my husbands needs&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t aware that I could not return it.  So, that is upsetting to me.</li>
    <li> It was okay expected something different but it was good.</li>
    <li> This plate is excellent for my father who has Dementia.  It helps him to be more independent with his meals. The high end allows him to scoop up his food and he enjoys the fact that he is eating independently without assistance.</li>
    <li> Perfect eating for people who usually spatter food particles all over the table!  I take this plate with me to dinner at other people&#x27;s houses...</li>
