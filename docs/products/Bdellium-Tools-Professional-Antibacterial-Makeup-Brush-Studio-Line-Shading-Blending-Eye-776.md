      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding from this brush, or any others from this brand.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>This is a great multi-tasker, as I have used this to apply concealer and eyeshadow across the lid.  </li>
      <li>It blends amazingly!</li>
      <li>I can perfectly blend all the colors and get more dimensions out of it</li>
      <li>I also bought the leatherette makeup brush holder/roll up &amp; it great as well, I love it!  </li>
      <li>Good for the price</li>
      <li>It seemed good to go.</li>
      <li>If you dont want to spend a fortune on Mac brushes this is a good dup.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a good blending brush and stumbled upon this one.</li>
      <li>It was even better that it was a great price.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it would had been a great eyeshadow blending brush</li>
      <li>I have had so many blending brushes (MAC, Smashbox, no name brushes...), but THIS brush is my favorite blending brush!!</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews I decided to buy two brushes I love &amp; use them so often I wish I would have bought three brushes at this price!</li>
      <li>Better set of brushes that some big brands but not the best of the best.</li>
      <li>In love with this brush!</li>
      <li>I love that the handles are brightly colored</li>
      <li>It came in time and was nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>Really nice brush.  </li>
      <li>It blends out the color nicely.</li>
      <li>The quality is on par with some of the popular brands.</li>
      <li>You just can&#x27;t ask for value that good when those are all $30 brushes (save for the real techniques, which is also a good value brush imo) and this one is a steal!</li>
      <li>Will be buying many more!</li>
      <li>Honestly its a better blending brush then my MAC.</li>
      <li>Really love this brush, it&#x27;s nice and dense to pack on color.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect size and the bristles are a great consistency, basically everything I was looking for in a stiff dome brush.</li>
      <li>This brush gets the color right into the crease and applies the eye shadow right to the outer v perfectly.</li>
      <li>still love these bdellium brushes though, as they are cheaper than my mac blenders and my one sigma brush</li>
      <li>I love using this brush for blending eyesahdows ..</li>
      <li>Love it ...</li>
      <li>my eyeshadow is perfect distributed and i noticed that there isn&#x27;t nearly as much extra fallout as the mk brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excellent working tools and optimum quality for that reason acquired this new brush to fulfill my professional needs, the preparation of this brush from the handle to the sow was created by experts Why I Buy with Confidence</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super soft &amp; The quality is very good (NO Shedding )</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had some of my bdellium brushes for awhile now (about a year) and they are still going strong</li>
      <li>It is a perfect Mac 217 dupe, and blends out harsh eyeshadow lines effortlessly, regardless of brand.</li>
      <li>My  new favorite brushes to use!</li>
      <li>But after one week use the brush doesn&#x27;t have the original shape and the bristles are blown.</li>
      <li>After washing/cleaning it dries and maintains it original state.</li>
      <li>And the fact that you can buy two of them for a little over what you&#x27;d pay for one of the MAC version is incredible.</li>
      <li>reason i gave it two stars was because i now use it for highlighting, which it does a good enough job of.</li>
      <li>Much prefer this style over a fluffy brush, as this one allows for more precision while still blending beautifully.</li>
      <li>and I was going to have to find the next best thing (or spend my money on an actual MAC 217 brush or Sigma dupe).</li>
      <li>The bristles are the perfect balance of soft and stiff, and it feels comfortable on the eye.</li>
      <li>Decided to order based on the reasonable price and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>It does the work just right.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m pretty cheap with my makeup brushes (all my brushes are pretty much from e.l.f.).</li>
      <li>Just as good as Sigma brushes but cost much less.</li>
      <li>But if you like to have many blending brushes like I do, I would buy few more maestro series instead.</li>
      <li>Its not as full as I expected and the bristle quality is just okay.</li>
      <li>when i saw it the first thing i noticed was that it was frayed.</li>
      <li>It blends pretty well.</li>
      <li>sometimes would on the first wash.</li>
      <li>I actually only use it after applying shadow to the lid and crease as a final blending with a slightly more pigmented shade to make the lid look more dimensional (adding glitter for depth).</li>
      <li>Exactly like MAC 217.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t blend to my satisfaction though i sat there patiently for a good few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this Bdellium brush is definitely worth picking up especially if you&#x27;re new to makeup brushes, as it&#x27;s 1000% better than using those tiny sponge applicators that come with many drug store eyeshadows.  </li>
      <li>I am buying other Bdellium brushes today after seeing how amazing this one is &amp; for the price how could you not.</li>
      <li>The 217 brush is unique to Mac, so finding an exact dupe right now is probably not possible.  </li>
      <li>I bought this brush based on the rumors of it being a mac 217 dupe and the fairly positive reviews here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>this was the top rated brush and it&#x27;s super saver shipping, reasonable price and as far as it&#x27;s actually blending abilities</li>
      <li>There really isn&#x27;t much to say about this brush.</li>
      <li>This brush is also very affordable.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used mary kay&#x27;s blending brush for literally years, it held up fantastic but it definately is starting to get ragged.</li>
      <li>but I expected more</li>
      <li>As a makeup artist they are decent for the price.</li>
      <li>I am a starting a makeup business and will likely purchase more for my kit.  </li>
      <li>Decent quality for the price.</li>
      <li>I would say it is a very close dupe for the MAC 217, although it is not as soft as the MAC brush.  </li>
      <li>Even after trying Sigmas, Real techniques, Sephora, Bobbi Brown, Laura Mercier, etc., even with all of those brushes sitting there I still reach for this one in the morning just as frequently.</li>
      <li>I need to buy a few more.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t scratchy and they work the same way, but I feel like the pink handled ones have softer hairs giving me a more diffused blended look.</li>
      <li>I use one for a light color, one for a crease color and one for a dark outer corner.</li>
      <li>The other is shorter and slimmer and it&#x27;s nice for smaller areas, but doesn&#x27;t cover as quickly obviously.</li>
      <li>I purchased 2 so far.  </li>
      <li>and it is soft on the skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say save your time and money and buy something that&#x27;s SOMEWHAT soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really nice brush.  I purchased 2 so far.  I would say it is a very close dupe for the MAC 217, although it is not as soft as the MAC brush.  Also, the 2 brushes I bought (both labeled 776) are different sizes.  One is bushier with longer bristles (this is the one closest to being the MAC 217 dupe).  The other is shorter and slimmer and it&#x27;s nice for smaller areas, but doesn&#x27;t cover as quickly obviously. I would like to purchase more but not sure about consistency of product since the 2 I bought of the same brush are so vastly different in size.  I am a starting a makeup business and will likely purchase more for my kit.  I had bought these for my personal use but am so pleased I think they will be a solid addition to my kit, so that I&#x27;m not spending $20-30 per brush from other quality brands.</li>
    <li> Brushes came quicky. Great quality. My  new favorite brushes to use!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how people could say this is a dupe for other blending brushes. This brush is the scratchiest brush I have ever come across. And I&#x27;m pretty cheap with my makeup brushes (all my brushes are pretty much from e.l.f.). Even brushing it on the back of my hand was painful. I&#x27;d say save your time and money and buy something that&#x27;s SOMEWHAT soft. The bristles are just way too prickly.</li>
    <li> I brought this brush after hearing that it is a great dupe for the MAC 217. I use it daily to apply a gentle wash of color all over the lid, or to blend out harsh lines when I create more complicated looks. It is the perfect size and the bristles are a great consistency, basically everything I was looking for in a stiff dome brush. It looks almost identical to the 217 and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. It is identical to M.A.C&#x27;s 217 brush. I hope it last as long as the MAC&#x27;s since I&#x27;ve had it for over five years now and it is in great condition.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good blending brush and stumbled upon this one. Decided to order based on the reasonable price and was not disappointed. Works well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m excellent working tools and optimum quality for that reason acquired this new brush to fulfill my professional needs, the preparation of this brush from the handle to the sow was created by experts Why I Buy with Confidence</li>
    <li> There really isn&#x27;t much to say about this brush. It really is a great dupe for the MAC 217. I use it to blend eyeshadows but I also use it to buff concealer under the eyes and on other areas of the face. And the fact that you can buy two of them for a little over what you&#x27;d pay for one of the MAC version is incredible. I need to buy a few more.</li>
    <li> Really love this brush, it&#x27;s nice and dense to pack on color. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very Good quality for the price and it is soft on the skin</li>

    <li> I have had so many blending brushes (MAC, Smashbox, no name brushes...), but THIS brush is my favorite blending brush!! Hands down! I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to blend out my crease color.  The size is perfect and it creates a beautiful transition between colors.  It has been wonderful buying from Sentyx.</li>
    <li> great brush....comparable to the sigma brush....</li>
    <li> Great price, unfortunately too scratchy vs the MAC 217 for my delicate eyelids. Havent tried the sigma dupe though..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these for teenage girls. As a makeup artist they are decent for the price. Better set of brushes that some big brands but not the best of the best. Decent quality for the price.</li>
    <li> In love with this brush! I have small eyes so sometimes the MAC 217 is too big for me and this is a smaller alternative. I use it almost everyday!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist, and I recently discovered this line of brushes. The quality is on par with some of the popular brands. It blended the shadows quite well, and didn&#x27;t irritate my clients&#x27; lids during a job I had this past weekend. I will probably get another one for my kit.  Oh, I also want to add that I did wash the brush and it has held up well with no shedding.</li>
    <li> feels a little scratchy but gets the job done. Good for the price I guess but I expected more</li>
    <li> Great blending brush. Just as good as Sigma brushes but cost much less.</li>
    <li> I hated this brush it was soooo rough. I couldn&#x27;t imagine trying to blend out anything with this hard and pretty stiff brush. For those who referenced the MAC 224 to this must have never actually owned &amp; used a 224. They aren&#x27;t comparable at all &amp; I would know as I am a MAC makeup/brushes owner. I bought this to see if I could save $$ since I need more 224&#x27;s, sadly mistaken I really wanted to like it....</li>
    <li> Love it ...comprare mas brochas son estupendas.....</li>
    <li> This blending brush is tricky - I don&#x27;t know what to use it for. It is really scratchy on my eyelids, and I don&#x27;t consider myself delicate. I guess you get what you pay for. I will continue the search for a fluffy blending brush, but in the meantime, my $1 elf blending brush blows this out of the water. It came in time and was nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> The brush performs okay, but the bristles are stiff and stabby (This has persisted through washing and conditioning the brush.) - not really pleasant when the brush is meant for eye use. I have relegated it to only being used for upper-crease or outer-socket use so it isn&#x27;t stabbing my eyelid.</li>
    <li> I am happy, very happy with this purchase and brush. I really thought I was going to spend another ten dollars on a dull brush that wasn&#x27;t going to work and I was going to have to find the next best thing (or spend my money on an actual MAC 217 brush or Sigma dupe). I am excited to say that I am wrong. This brush gets the color right into the crease and applies the eye shadow right to the outer v perfectly. It blends out the color nicely. The brush doesn&#x27;t even take that long to dry. All my other brushes take several hours to become completely dry. This brush took maybe a half an hour.   I think the only down side to it is the brush came all frayed out. I washed it though and pushed down all the frizzied out sides. It seemed good to go. I am thinking in a few weeks, I will purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I had the yellow handles and the maestro series (black handle) blending brush. The yellow one seems a little rougher than the black one. I&#x27;ve been using it over a year now. I washed my brushes a minimum of once a week. The hair started to fall off on this. But the maestro series (black handle) doesn&#x27;t have this problem yet. I also have MAC 217..  Overall, I still think you pay what you get for..  But if you like to have many blending brushes like I do, I would buy few more maestro series instead.</li>
    <li> This brush is very similar to the MAC 217 blending brush. The bristles are very slightly less stiff and softer than the MAC. Ive washed mine several time and have seen no loss of hairs. Great equivalent brush, but much less expensive.</li>
    <li> If you dont want to spend a fortune on Mac brushes this is a good dup.  The only problem is the paint cracks and chips off.  Not visually appealing but works.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel as gentle on my eyes as other bdellium brushes, but i believe it&#x27;s because of how densely packed and tapered this brush is.  It is a perfect Mac 217 dupe, and blends out harsh eyeshadow lines effortlessly, regardless of brand.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to buy two brushes I love &amp; use them so often I wish I would have bought three brushes at this price! It blends amazingly! Honestly its a better blending brush then my MAC. I also bought the leatherette makeup brush holder/roll up &amp; it great as well, I love it!  I am buying other Bdellium brushes today after seeing how amazing this one is &amp; for the price how could you not.</li>
    <li> This is a great blending brush. It does the work just right. Great quality and great price!!!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Sheds a little more than expected but it gets the job done</li>
    <li> I bought this brush based on the rumors of it being a mac 217 dupe and the fairly positive reviews here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;1) when i saw it the first thing i noticed was that it was frayed. I was annoyed but i could deal with that&lt;br /&gt;2) i tried to blend out a crease color with it. Didn&#x27;t blend to my satisfaction though i sat there patiently for a good few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3) it turned out to be quite scratchy and the crease of my eye was red and stung a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say i will NOT repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason i gave it two stars was because i now use it for highlighting, which it does a good enough job of. Nonetheless did not perform the way i wanted it to or what it was made to do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all. Scratchy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I saw a video on YouTube where the makeup artist was using this item. It was promptly delivered, and it&#x27;s also a great product. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This brush is great. Even after trying Sigmas, Real techniques, Sephora, Bobbi Brown, Laura Mercier, etc., even with all of those brushes sitting there I still reach for this one in the morning just as frequently. You just can&#x27;t ask for value that good when those are all $30 brushes (save for the real techniques, which is also a good value brush imo) and this one is a steal!</li>
    <li> This is a great multi-tasker, as I have used this to apply concealer and eyeshadow across the lid.  Bristles do not stab me like other brushes, which can irritate my sensitive skin.  Previous reviewers say this is a dupe of the 217 brush from Mac, which is why I ordered it.  However,  comparing this brush with the 217, I think they are quite different in shape.  They are similar in the fact that this brush can serve mutliple functions like the 217 can. The 217 brush is unique to Mac, so finding an exact dupe right now is probably not possible.  So if you want a 217, buy it from Mac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this Bdellium brush is definitely worth picking up especially if you&#x27;re new to makeup brushes, as it&#x27;s 1000% better than using those tiny sponge applicators that come with many drug store eyeshadows.  For those who are not new to makeup brushes, I suggest buying a few of these to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Love this brush and this is my 3rd purchase of the same brush due to it being so versatile. I use one for a light color, one for a crease color and one for a dark outer corner. The brush is soft and blends shadows evenly. I have had some minor shedding on these but nothing major enough to be considered negative in my opinion. All brushes with these types of bristles are bound to shed a little at some point but with proper cleaning and care will last forever.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Exactly like MAC 217. Save your money and buy this.</li>
    <li> It works well blending my eye shadows. But after one week use the brush doesn&#x27;t have the original shape and the bristles are blown.</li>
    <li> This blending brush does what it says but its not that great of a brush. Its not as full as I expected and the bristle quality is just okay. After washing/cleaning it dries and maintains it original state. Wish it were softer and  fuller. I actually only use it after applying shadow to the lid and crease as a final blending with a slightly more pigmented shade to make the lid look more dimensional (adding glitter for depth).</li>
    <li> It blends pretty well. And for the price, it is awesome. It just feels a little scratchy to the skin. And sometimes I wish that I had splurged  on a Sigma blending brush for softer fibers. I do like the results though. And I use this brush religiously at each application.</li>
    <li> I like that it is vegan. It was even better that it was a great price. But they are great in performance as well.</li>
    <li> I used this brush for blending my eye makeup. I can perfectly blend all the colors and get more dimensions out of it (I usually use about 5 different colors/shades). This brush is also very affordable.Try it if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
    <li> This brush is a dupe for MAC&#x27;s 217 brush, the bristles are not as dense but are still dense enough to give the same effect as the 217. I would recommend Bedellium brushes for someone trying to build their brush collection on a budget. They are affordable and well constructed!</li>
    <li> I love using this brush for blending eyesahdows .. It&#x27;s super soft &amp; The quality is very good (NO Shedding )</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the bdellium brush line, but for some reason these yellow handle bdellium brushes are not as soft as the pink handled ones. They aren&#x27;t scratchy and they work the same way, but I feel like the pink handled ones have softer hairs giving me a more diffused blended look. I have the pink handled ones and two yellow handled brushes in the same style (# 776 and 785) and no doubt about it, the pink handled brushes are softer. They were the same price as the yellow ones when I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;I still love these bdellium brushes though, as they are cheaper than my mac blenders and my one sigma brush but they are still comparable in quality and when I wash them, they don&#x27;t shed like my sigma sometimes would on the first wash. I love that the handles are brightly colored so I can distinguish them from the tons of black brushes I have and they seem like they would last a long time. I&#x27;ve had some of my bdellium brushes for awhile now (about a year) and they are still going strong and I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> Best crease brush I&#x27;ve used. Much prefer this style over a fluffy brush, as this one allows for more precision while still blending beautifully. The bristles are the perfect balance of soft and stiff, and it feels comfortable on the eye. Holds up great to washing - I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding from this brush, or any others from this brand. Will be buying many more!</li>
    <li> When I received it the handle part broke off so I had to return it &#x3D;( The hair were really soft and I&#x27;m sure it would had been a great eyeshadow blending brush but I couldn&#x27;t enjoy it &#x3D;( Maybe next time.</li>
    <li> was the producuto I wanted and arrive on time</li>
