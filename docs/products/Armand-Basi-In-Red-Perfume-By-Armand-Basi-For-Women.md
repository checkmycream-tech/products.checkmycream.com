    <li> i was looking for it for so long time and i am so glad that at last i found it</li>
    <li> I have bought many from different vendors and this one appears to be either very old, or a knock off. Cap comes apart and the perfume smells off from others we have bought. We plan to return it for exchange or refund.</li>
    <li> Love love love love!!  Was super excited to find this since it&#x27;s discontinued &amp; was 100% satisfied!</li>
    <li> I simply love this fragrance and I was so glad to be able to find it and it arrived super fast. It is a shame that Armand has stopped making this product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic fragrance, especially for summer time! It&#x27;s light, refreshing, and unique. My mom bought it for me on a suggestion from a store clerk years ago, and I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love it. Light and fresh</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Great price for this item. Probably half of what I found retail. Prompt delivery on this item - was a gift for a family member and they were delighted.</li>

    <li> I love it. Use this perfume a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance years ago Duty Free at Heathrow.  Never heard of it before and the floor clerk was really pushing it.  So, I thought \\&quot;What the heck!\\&quot;  I really liked it and it was something different and new.  I got so many complements on it!  I paid at least triple at Duty Free.  Buy it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Always got compliments for the nice smell. My third bottle so far and many more to come.</li>
    <li> oh it just smells perfect!</li>
    <li> This has been discontinued, so I was so glad to find it!  It arrived just fine and within a reasonable time.</li>
    <li> As title says Armand Basi Red, that it Red and they are in red container.  But we have received is different from what we ordered and paid for,</li>
    <li> Smells really good. We buy this perfume upon the next empty bottle. The only one thing is that it&#x27;s not very long lasting, but great buy for the prize. Would recommend it to every  beautiful woman</li>
