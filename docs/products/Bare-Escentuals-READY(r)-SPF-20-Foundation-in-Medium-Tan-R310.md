      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>This was the first time I have ordered a compact stye foundation and have been very pleased.</li>
      <li>I use slightly wet sponge to apply and I get a flawless, messless, matte foundation.</li>
      <li>The coverage is smooth and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>To begin The colors are way too light.</li>
      <li>Just tap it or swirl it on there once, and it&#x27;s plenty for light coverage.  </li>
      <li>I got a shade darker like it told me to, but I still think it&#x27;s too light.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, I hadn&#x27;t been &amp;#34;shade matched&amp;#34; at a BM store, since there isn&#x27;t one anywhere near me.  </li>
      <li>but in reviews, it says it&#x27;s lighter than the original formula.  </li>
      <li>I usually use a medium beige but after reading reviews I went a shade darker which worked perfect.</li>
      <li>Oh, I use a  very lightly moistened sponge applicator to put them on too, which really smooths the look of my skin.</li>
      <li>All I need now is moisturizer, then Ready Foundation on top.</li>
      <li>This works great for me; not drying or enlarging my pores like other review said.</li>
      <li>Always liked bare minerals!</li>
      <li>I was excited when I saw this little compact and though it would be great</li>
      <li>and I live in a pretty warm climate.  </li>

      <li>Thank you so much for your quick delivery, needed this product for an approaching wedding and is perfect for the day and now as my everyday make up.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, looks natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much of my scarring this covers up since it&#x27;s only a powder.</li>
      <li>Great product last a long time!</li>
      <li>Ready Foundation offers FANTASTIC coverage.</li>
      <li>I always enjoy Bare Escentuals products.</li>
      <li>This bare minerals foundation is fabulous for my combination skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the loose mineral powder for years but like this product better.</li>
      <li>I like the loose powder in medium tan C30 and wanted to try this, as it would be better for my makeup bag, not being a lose powder that can spill...</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
      <li>Since I have to order so much stuff on-line</li>
      <li>It does however wear very lightweight.</li>
      <li>Their foundation cost almost three times the cost of the Ready SPF 20 Foundation.  </li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>It eliminates the need for concealer and feels much lighter than liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>I was very upset over this particular order.</li>
      <li>not understanding how many different shades of Tan bare minerals has?</li>
      <li>I love this, however this one I purchase seems to get very matted down.</li>
      <li>The foundation is like new again!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It is better than the loose powder that Bare Minerals was known for.  </li>
      <li>You waste more powder</li>
      <li>I brought this product into my local Bare Minerals store and they confirmed that what I was describing is indeed a normal feature of this foundation.</li>
      <li>I do like .this new foundation.  </li>
      <li>(I live overseas.)</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin.,</li>
      <li>Arrived completely shattered and unusable!</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>Was simply enclosed in a large size padded envelope and bounced around inside on</li>
      <li>The pressed powder was COMPLETELY shattered when it got here...</li>
      <li>Its just confusing to customers to have so many problems between B.E. foundations.</li>
      <li>I was so surprised at the coverage with this product.  </li>
      <li>I have more mature skin, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I had read the reviews that said it was a few shades lighter than the original formula, so I decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>I was thinking I could use it as a setting powder which I occasionally do but also use it some days as my main foundation.  </li>
      <li>This is much easier to apply than the loose foundation.</li>
      <li>Bare Essentials you should be ashamed of yourself.</li>
      <li>LIKE WHAT I BUY AT THE BARE ESSENTIALS STORE.  </li>
      <li>No longer do I have to use heavy liquid foundation and powder and concealer all piled on top of each other just to get enough coverage.</li>
      <li>I use a heavy hand with it because of my scars, but if your skin is fairly clear, a light application will give you a soft, even look without looking or feeling too heavy.</li>
      <li>My skin is tan, so my scars are very visible and dark.</li>
      <li>It seems different consistency than when purchased at the Bare Minerals store.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m going back to there normal loose powder foundation.</li>
      <li>It covers well and is not nearly as messy as the loose minerals.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I usually use a medium beige but after reading reviews I went a shade darker which worked perfect. My big complaint is it&#x27;s horrible to get out of the compact. You waste more powder then you actually use and we all know this product is not cheap. Don&#x27;t like this product one bit.</li>
    <li> I have extremely acne-prone, scarred up skin. I feel self conscious going anywhere without makeup because my scars are so dark, numerous, and often inflamed-looking. My skin is tan, so my scars are very visible and dark. I&#x27;ve been going to a dermatologist for years, but acne and especially scarring is very hard to get rid of completely. I get so tired of caking on foundation just so people won&#x27;t stare at my skin and ask me what&#x27;s wrong with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product changed my life, truly. No longer do I have to use heavy liquid foundation and powder and concealer all piled on top of each other just to get enough coverage. Ready Foundation offers FANTASTIC coverage. All I need now is moisturizer, then Ready Foundation on top. Apply it with one of those flat brushes in circular strokes. It&#x27;s amazing how much of my scarring this covers up since it&#x27;s only a powder. I use a heavy hand with it because of my scars, but if your skin is fairly clear, a light application will give you a soft, even look without looking or feeling too heavy. I love this stuff. It eliminates the need for concealer and feels much lighter than liquid foundation. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t block pores and has not caused any outbreaks in acne for me. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for your quick delivery, needed this product for an approaching wedding and is perfect for the day and now as my everyday make up. Thank YOU!! AAA+++</li>
    <li> I WILL NOT PURCHASE MY FAVORITE MAKEUP THROUGH YOU AGAIN.  I FEEL THIS IS A COPY/FRAUD AND DOES NOT FEEL OR LOOK LIKE WHAT I BUY AT THE BARE ESSENTIALS STORE.  THIS MAKEUP IN THE COMPACT NEVER FLAKES OR BECOMES POWDERY.  MAKE UP WAS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE BATHROOM  ALSO THE MAKEUP CRACKED IN SEVERAL PLACES AND CAME OUT OF THE CASE!  WHAT A MESS!</li>
    <li> I love it it covers really good</li>
    <li> It came broken in pieces, had to send it back.</li>
    <li> Bare Essentials you should be ashamed of yourself. To begin The colors are way too light. I&#x27;m a medium beige in their powder. So I ordered two shades darker and it STILL almost white. Its just confusing to customers to have so many problems between B.E. foundations. You would think they might keep shades the same weather its loose powder, pressed or liquid. Also.... another big issue is the way it accentuates lines, pores and wrinkles. Ones I didn&#x27;t even know were there. Very disappointed..... ill give it to my teenage niece. It does however wear very lightweight.</li>
    <li> Always liked bare minerals! It&#x27;s a great product! Good coverage and shade match. Really like this product. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It covers well and is not nearly as messy as the loose minerals. It arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally confused. Is this a pressed powder you can use with a brush, or what typically comes with your standard round compact? or is this a foundation that you use with a damp sponge? or can you use it both ways? I saw a review that says the customer used a damp sponge. I like the loose powder in medium tan C30 and wanted to try this, as it would be better for my makeup bag, not being a lose powder that can spill...but in reviews, it says it&#x27;s lighter than the original formula.  I  didn&#x27;t know medium tan had different shades? The medium tan C 30 in this compact is $ 59.00. The other shades in medium are $20 dollars cheaper. Totally lost here! not understanding how many different shades of Tan bare minerals has? Any feed back would be helpful. I would still like to try this if it&#x27;s a pressed powder*</li>
    <li> Just as discribed love this product</li>
    <li> I always enjoy Bare Escentuals products. This was the first time I have ordered a compact stye foundation and have been very pleased. The coverage is smooth and easy to work with. The products came well packaged too. Oh, I use a  very lightly moistened sponge applicator to put them on too, which really smooths the look of my skin.</li>
    <li> think it was bad batch.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation.  It goes on easily and covers very nicely.  I have more mature skin, so a little goes a long way.  This is much easier to apply than the loose foundation.</li>
    <li> The pressed powder was COMPLETELY shattered when it got here... I have no intention on ordering makeup from amazon again...</li>
    <li> Best mineral foundation out there and great value for money. Looks good and feels good too.  Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> love this version of the foundation. coverage is good and lightweight</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is better than the loose powder that Bare Minerals was known for.  This is for more coverage.  The price great too.</li>
    <li> MY mineral makeup, great price and service.</li>
    <li> just as if I had purchased it from the store but I did not have to stand in line!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the loose mineral powder for years but like this product better. Same coverage. More convenient. Less loss of powder.</li>
    <li> I would not know how this truly performed as it arrived all broken up ,and the dust flying everywhere, all over my table. Mess to clean up and landing all over my skin, feeling nasty. Had to pay for return shipping! Was simply enclosed in a large size padded envelope and bounced around inside on it&#x27;s long journey to my home.</li>
    <li> I got a shade darker like it told me to, but I still think it&#x27;s too light.  I look like a ghost when using this make up</li>
    <li> I love Bare Escentuals products and have used them for years. It may be that the color is not the best for me. Great service and delivery.</li>
    <li> I just had a makeover done at a salon with another mineral makeup line.  Their foundation cost almost three times the cost of the Ready SPF 20 Foundation.  It did not cover near as well and the color changed after a few hours.  This bare minerals foundation is fabulous for my combination skin.  It stays looking great all day and I live in a pretty warm climate.  Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> So, when I ordered this, I had already been using the loose mineral foundation in medium tan.  And had decided that perhaps it was a little too &amp;#34;orange-y&amp;#34; for me.  To be fair, I hadn&#x27;t been &amp;#34;shade matched&amp;#34; at a BM store, since there isn&#x27;t one anywhere near me.  Since I have to order so much stuff on-line (I live overseas.), I had already ordered this before I decided to switch colors. I had read the reviews that said it was a few shades lighter than the original formula, so I decided to try it.  And it was perfect! It works great with the Flawless Face Brush from BM.  Just tap it or swirl it on there once, and it&#x27;s plenty for light coverage.  Do it once again, and you&#x27;ll have medium coverage.  The color blends well, and it seems as though this compact will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Love everything about it! The color is perfect and it applies so smoothly and stays put all day! I will order again!!!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I was so surprised at the coverage with this product.  I have rosacea &amp; flawed skin so like a full coverage foundation.  I was hesitant on this powder.  I was thinking I could use it as a setting powder which I occasionally do but also use it some days as my main foundation.  It has GREAT coverage!&lt;br /&gt;I saw the reviews saying it is messy but if you use it correctly it isn&#x27;t messy at all.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I truly love the foundation</li>
    <li> Terrible packaging! Arrived completely shattered and unusable!</li>
    <li> This works great for me; not drying or enlarging my pores like other review said. It&#x27;s not too matte either. It is just right and allows you to keep your make up pretty simple because it provides good coverage in just 1 step.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast.  This is a great product.  I had been using their loose powder for years now.  I do like .this new foundation.  Easy to apply, looks natural. Love the benefits you get from this product...that is good for your skin and has SPF20 protection. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well for me and my skin.</li>
    <li> this order although I have ordered this product before was very unpleasant. the order I received was almost as if it was outdated, dry and not the normal makeup. I was very upset over this particular order.</li>
    <li> I LOVE bareminerals foundation and have used it for about 10 years. I was excited when I saw this little compact and though it would be great but I&#x27;m going back to there normal loose powder foundation. This one smelled badly and was incredibly messy. Impossible to use a brush with this. That being said, I did use it until it ran out.</li>
    <li> Nice foundation,but I could not use it. I broke out afterwards. I have very sensitive skin.,</li>
    <li> I have been using the powder for about 2 years now, but I reverted several times t my Chanel foundation. The powder is messy, and if you travel a lot, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to stick with. The pressed foundation has been the turning point for me. I don&#x27;t really understand why other users say it&#x27;s messy... I use slightly wet sponge to apply and I get a flawless, messless, matte foundation. The coverage is great, and I like not having a cloud of dust around me when applying it.</li>
    <li> I love this, however this one I purchase seems to get very matted down. When I use my brush it seems like hardly any foundation is getting on the brush. I don&#x27;t know if it was due to hot/cold when shipping? It seems different consistency than when purchased at the Bare Minerals store.  UPDATE!! I brought this product into my local Bare Minerals store and they confirmed that what I was describing is indeed a normal feature of this foundation. If you have oily skin (which I do) the oil from the brush gets onto the compact and forms a thin layer making the foundation seem &amp;#34;matted down.&amp;#34; They advised me to use a piece of scotch tape to press onto the compact and remove the thin layer of buildup. The foundation is like new again!</li>
    <li> Great product last a long time!</li>
</ol>
