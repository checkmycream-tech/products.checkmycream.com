      <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
      <li>Very happy with the whole experence</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is a nice tingling feeling after application that I like.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say this eye stuff really works great</li>
      <li>Nice and creamy just the way I like it.</li>
      <li>Would be nice if they included caffeine.</li>
      <li>nice product, expect no miracles</li>
      <li>It feels nice to put on</li>
      <li>: Feels great, cool sensation and wakes me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more effective that way.</li>
      <li>(the most effective out of the bunch was clinique&#x27;s eye fuel).  </li>
      <li>was hopeing for something more</li>
      <li>Definitely refreshing.</li>
      <li>but my circles are still as prominent as they were before.</li>
      <li>Seems to improve sagging to an extent, however, I&#x27;m saddled with bags that need something more.</li>
      <li>I love the packaging on this.</li>
      <li>I showed it to my dermatologist and she was impressed enough to start selling this product for men in her office.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, would not purchase again</li>
      <li>To others, it appeared as if I am as healthy as an ox.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous products but this one has had the best results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve found this to work a lot better than any under eye roller I have tried.</li>
      <li>Besides that, I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but the lotion is nice</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>so I did for the most part but always used the gel.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is waterier than I&#x27;d like, and that means it takes more energy to rub it in.</li>
      <li>Really enjoyed this product after about a months use.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant smelling, and as with all Kyoku products you dont need very much.  </li>
      <li>The duel dispenser is kind of cool...</li>
      <li>Feels pretty good.</li>
      <li>Its also nice because it is not greasy and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Good for the price, although don&#x27;t expect to much from it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a couple other eye products, and this one has had the best results.</li>
      <li>and it goes on easy (not greasy/shiny)  </li>
      <li>However, a good friend of mine suggested this product line and suggested I tell others to use high quality products to enhance one&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>Great for general upkeep.  </li>
      <li>I definitely notice an improvement in the appearance of the bags under my eyes, and along with good sleep, drinking lots of water, and a relatively healthy diet, my eyes look and feel more refreshed.</li>
      <li>I first tried Kyoku with their Kyoku for Men Electric Pre Shave Optimizer, 1.7 Fluid Ounce and what an awesome product that is.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping with more consistent use, it will improve even more.</li>
      <li>Absolutely as described and more!</li>
      <li>That said, it helps with both of those issues, enough so that I&#x27;d happily use this product again.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic men&#x27;s product that visibly works.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great eye cream to enhance your looks, go no further.</li>
      <li>very nice, soft item understated but powerful tool to combat aging for us guys</li>
      <li>Two products in one bottle with the double pump is great, although it would be nice to be able to tell how much is left in the container.</li>
      <li>I notice that when he wears it his eyes do look better, more alive but</li>
      <li>quick and light cream.</li>
      <li>The combo cream/gel in the single container works great for travel.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s probably using the bottle right now while I type this... BABE!</li>
      <li>This product is great, I have noticed a visible difference after only a few minutes, I use this in conjunction with the Kyoku moisturizer for my face and it feels great, not greasy and does not clog pores either.</li>
      <li>You dont even need a full pump.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to those looking to improve their appearance because it is cheap and others seem to have had success, but I do not think I will purchase it again.</li>
      <li>This product really helps my eyes feel better and improves their appearance.  </li>
      <li>Seriously though, a great product!</li>
      <li>Eyes are where fine lines first appear on anyone</li>
      <li>It makes me feel better about my face, and I definitely see firmer, healthy skin.</li>
      <li>the Kyouku itself is really super</li>
      <li>I gave 2 stars because I did get the product quickly from the distributor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
      <li>After you apply both lotion (1) for lightening of dark circle (2) a gel that shrinks your bags, it works in 5-10 mins and worked great.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, this stuff works miracles and within the first week I was seeing drastic results.</li>
      <li>Though I dont use it everyday, this stuff is great.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Decent compared to this lines other products that will cause acne</li>
    <li> This product comes with 2 &amp;#34;sides&amp;#34;.  One side is a clear blue gel and the other is a white cream.  The blue gel side of mine was essentially empty while the white cream side was full.  I like the cream but I am bothered that there was no blue gel in my new bottle, paying full price for half of a product.</li>
    <li> One side of the pump did not work very well, gel side ran out before the moisturizer side, noticed very little difference after using for about a month.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, but it&#x27;s not a miracle cream, I don&#x27;t believe such a cream necessarily exists. It does keep the area around your eyes moisturized and feeling energized. You only need just a very small amount. Do not over apply.</li>
    <li> It does get rid of the bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!  works great and affordable - makes my eyes look brighter and seems to reduce some of the dark circles I get from staying up too late :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for bags under my eyes. Seller is very fast, product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for 3 days now and i swear my eyes look amazing, i suffer from a sleeping disorder via post 9/11 military, and always look like i havent slept in weeks. Since using this i actually look alive and no more black or puffy eyes. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have bags under my eyes and I always have had bags under my eyes and this actually seems to help. The difference isn&#x27;t huge but you do notice that the eyes look less puffy and you don&#x27;t look nearly as tired.</li>
    <li> I have use this product every morning and it&#x27;s amazing. But it really shines whenever I use it the morning after a long night out - clears up the dark circles under my eyes before I go to work, school, or church. Combine this with a cup of ridiculously strong coffee and you will barely need sleep. Seriously though, a great product!</li>
    <li> My eyes have bags from not sleeping enough. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and have not noticed much difference in my eyes.  Sometimes I think I am noticing a small improvement, but am not sure if it&#x27;s genuine or a placebo -- the result of me wanting to see a change.&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice tingling feeling after application that I like.  I would recommend this product to those looking to improve their appearance because it is cheap and others seem to have had success, but I do not think I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping but it isn&#x27;t hurting.  Hasn&#x27;t made me break out so it&#x27;s a great product in my eyes.  Pun intended.</li>
    <li> Works really well for eliminating bags and puffiness the eyes.</li>
    <li> excellent product and a great price. Very happy with the whole experence</li>
    <li> I buy this one for my father and he like it very much. And the price of it is not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husb and he says he likes it. I notice that when he wears it his eyes do look better, more alive but he&lt;br /&gt;isn&#x27;t real thrilled about putting creams on so consistency is key.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy in college and I tend to stay up late at night studying and getting up early to lift. I tend to have bad genetics so I usually have the purpleness under my eyes. Kyoku for men eye fuel is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Tried product for 2 months twice a day with no noticeable difference. I gave 2 stars because I did get the product quickly from the distributor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my previous product that did cost a lot more from Saks 5th Avenue but really worked well.</li>
    <li> Seems to improve sagging to an extent, however, I&#x27;m saddled with bags that need something more. Would be nice if they included caffeine.</li>
    <li> good packing and reasonale price. quick and light cream.</li>
    <li> tried that once and like it!!!&lt;br /&gt;this product really works as described, and gives to your tired eyes&lt;br /&gt;total refreshment look.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about these type products and though it was a little feminine to be using them. The bags under my eyes seemed to get worse, so I eventually got this. It works. People stopped asking if I was sick everyday, and the hangover comments ceased. The 0.7oz seems small, but you use an almost microscopic amount each day. Its actually two solutions that you mix. I am a believer now (I still hide it in a drawer every night).</li>
    <li> this s*** burns!!! I like all of kyoku&#x27;s other products, but this one is not cuttn it.</li>
    <li> Kyoku Eye Fuel performs as it stated in the description.  There are dual pumps, one for eye cream and another for eye gel.  You can use them separately or in combination; I found that using them together yields the greatest results.  Compared to Lab Series Eye Repair, I like this product better, works fast  and just as good (if not better).  Also is about $15 cheaper per bottle</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple weeks now and I can&#x27;t say that it does any better than the Loreall cold eye roller.</li>
    <li> The duel dispenser is kind of cool...haha...you only need a small amount from each side to cover the areas under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Like all types of quality men&#x27;s facial care, it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not had this very long, but I do like it so far.  I&#x27;d tried others like this, and they bothered my eyes, but this didn&#x27;t at all. I like the dispenser a lot, too.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any visual benefits from this product but maybe I didn&#x27;t use it regularly enough. I used it for a few nights in a row and then i would miss a night but I never saw any change.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging on this. Two products in one bottle with the double pump is great, although it would be nice to be able to tell how much is left in the container. I like the texture and feel of the products, and they are easy to use with no mess. However, having used them consistently for several weeks, I am not seeing a real improvement. I do have a certain amount of genetic baggage under my eyes and am not expecting a miracle to occur...just hoping for something.</li>
    <li> I first tried Kyoku with their Kyoku for Men Electric Pre Shave Optimizer, 1.7 Fluid Ounce and what an awesome product that is.  So, I have tried others, including this one.  Though I dont use it everyday, this stuff is great.  Its deosnt take 10 years off my eyes, but it does make the skin under my eyes feel tighter and less tired feeling. Pleasant smelling, and as with all Kyoku products you dont need very much.  Small amounts go a long way with all of their products, making it valuable, even if the cost is high, you get longer and more uses out of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Zirth platinum products, Anthony&#x27;s product, jack black and non of those premium product can compare to this. After you apply both lotion (1) for lightening of dark circle (2) a gel that shrinks your bags, it works in 5-10 mins and worked great. i don&#x27;t know what else to write here for this really good product. if you have a question about the product, drop me a comment.</li>
    <li> i use it 3 weeks,but it doesn&#x27;t work,nothing happened.</li>
    <li> It feels good cooling around the eyes. Temporarily will shrink and help with puffy eyes. Good eye cream to use.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it actually works or just placebo effect. It does sting a little bit.</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy just the way I like it. It has 2 pumps and I like to use them together even though they say you can use them alone if you want. Feels pretty good.</li>
    <li> The gel/cream combo is nice for dual daytime/nighttime application, but I didn&#x27;t especially see any results from the product. Further usage is necessary for a full appraisal.</li>
    <li> Burnt my eyes and my wife made fun of me, even though it came in a super sweet, totally masculine, black bottle! Whatever, she&#x27;s just mad. She&#x27;s probably using the bottle right now while I type this... BABE! GET AWAY FROM THE MAN SHELF!!! IT&#x27;S ALL I HAVE LEFT IN THIS WORLD!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff feels good as you put it on.  Besides that, I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but the lotion is nice</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My coworkers kept saying my eyes were dark and that has stopped since I started using. The only problem is the packaging itself because the pumps fall off</li>
    <li> Even for being relatively young (24) I&#x27;ve had saggy, puffy eyes for a while. I blame late nights of studying and relatively little sleep since college. Fortunately, this stuff works miracles and within the first week I was seeing drastic results. The area under my eyes is much more firm and smooth, and the puffiness is completely gone. Even after late nights at work, I can put this stuff on in the morning and avoid the usual &amp;#34;you like really tired&amp;#34; comments from colleagues.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price. Plus, you use so little during each application that I don&#x27;t foresee any issue with one bottle lasting me several months. Save your eyes and buy this stuff!</li>
    <li> After using a few times I didn&#x27;t really see any change in my eyes. As a med student I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep since starting college 5 years ago as a pre-med so I have pretty dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve used Kyoku products in the past and really liked them so I tried this one out. I neither feel a difference in my under eye region or see any lessening in the darkness of the bags under my eyes when I use this vs when i don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Eyes are where fine lines first appear on anyone the earlier you start the better but its never to late. The uplifting eye ingredients in this are extensive  Im a big fan of this product because I like it enough said I hope it comes state side and thus has a price reduction but its still a lot less expensive than a lot of the competition and one of the first on the mens market im guessing since men taking care of themselves is more socially accepted in other cultures but tell then thanks a lot Kyoku!</li>
    <li> I am using this product since last 10-15 days and already noticed improvement. Will stay with this product till i totally get rid of my under eye puffiness and dullness.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for guys eyes! I Wakes me up in the mornings and gives me a great look. And the price is great too! You dont even need a full pump. Only a small pea sized amount.</li>
    <li> Absolutely as described and more! Everyone who&#x27;s on the fence try this now! You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
    <li> Like I said in the headline, this product is great at reducing eye puffiness, and is a good moisturizer. I wish it helped more with dark circles though... this would be a perfect eye product if that was the case. I definitely notice an improvement in the appearance of the bags under my eyes, and along with good sleep, drinking lots of water, and a relatively healthy diet, my eyes look and feel more refreshed. I apply the gel first, followed by the cream, once before bed and once after my morning routine. My eyes feel refreshed, and I notice a lot less eye twitching with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a couple other eye products, and this one has had the best results. I am still looking for a product that improves the look of dark circles as well, but every year there are 4-8 new eye products that fail to deliver. This is my go-to product in the mean time, but I do not like how they continuously raise the price, and this only encourages me to look for a different product.</li>
    <li> Just not seeing a darn thing...maybe check back in a year...</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!  A little goes a long way and it goes on easy (not greasy/shiny)  This is my second bottle and the results just keep improving with time.  Crows feet and &amp;#34;tired eyes&amp;#34; are almost non-existent at this point.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Another Kyoku product that impresses me.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with the tired look in the morning accompanied with an abundance of &amp;#34;late night last night, huh&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;you look like death&amp;#34; comments.  This stuff literally brings me back to life! Late night, no sleep, no problem! As long as I have this stuff I seem to be fooling everyone! I use the cream at night and the eye gel in the morning and that seems to be doing the trick for me! I can&#x27;t help looking at myself in the mirror during the day and be shocked by how normal I look after being hungover and getting no sleep! I have tried numerous products but this one has had the best results. I am buying a second bottle to be stocked up when my current one runs out, just in case! It has already lasted me a couple of months of daily use and doesn&#x27;t even seem close to running out, but you can never be too cautious when it&#x27;s something you depend on!! Do yourself a favor and buy this now!!</li>
    <li> This product lives up to the advertisement. I get deep dark circles under my eyes, mainly from drinking two-three cups off coffee a day. Tried other products but none remove dark circles as effectively as Kyoku. Only downside is the price. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have been purchase this cream in December 2013, did not use use it until May, so I want to say ,that cream and gel itself are really good, but the problem is that eye radiance cream magically finished very fast,in same time uplifting eye the gel is still running, I did use the same amount of both ,guess been unlucky and receive spoiled staff, even sorry to give 3 stars only because of it . the Kyouku itself is really super I can recommend it to everyone .</li>
    <li> Product is suppose to be the combination of two creams.  One side is empty.</li>
    <li> This product really helps my eyes feel better and improves their appearance.  It is also priced fairly for products of this type.  (Review written by Bun&#x27;s husband)</li>
    <li> This product does what it describes, and does it well. I started looking into this because with the stress of college and my manual labor job, bags started to form under my eyes. I was looking very tired all of the time.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of days the darkness (blueish purple color) started to disappear. After about a week my lines were shrinking. Two weeks in and the change is phenomenal! Great product, and since you use only a little it will last you quite a while.</li>
    <li> This product does the job perfectly .. I would definitely recommend it ..&lt;br /&gt;The price you pay for it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> The product seems to be working. Have used for about 3 weeks. Problem is that the container when arrived seemed to be not full. Box was worn and damaged. Would have rated higher if product was not damaged and bottle full of product.</li>
    <li> Have Used Daily for a Couple of Years Works Great Just use a Small Drop of Each Side White Then Blue Wrinkles Disappear</li>
    <li> Did not work at all!!! This is a 25.00 dollar bottle of eye lotion. Doesn&#x27;t do anything it claims. I&#x27;ll try the rehab roller next time</li>
    <li> This is meant to help with the bags under your eyes and it really works well for me. When applying it I can feel it tighten under my eyes a little bit. The best part is that it wakes me up when I use it in the morning. It helps to get rid of the tired droop that I get in the morning and is almost like an energy drink for my eyes. Great product</li>
    <li> Great product!! Really helps tired eyes!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing - there&#x27;s no other way to put it.  I read about the Kyoku Eye Fuel on a men&#x27;s fashion forum and it&#x27;s changed my life.  My eyes look 100% better after using a small amount daily and now I look years younger and more refreshed.  This eye fuel greatly enhances your appearance and the bottle last about 2-3 months with daily use.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends and they&#x27;ve been raving about it too.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great eye cream to enhance your looks, go no further.</li>
    <li> doesnt work - gave it a solid month, seems to have only brought more attention to the bags under my eyes. Not impressed</li>
    <li> Soothing. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate under eye puffiness, and it doesn&#x27;t erase the dark circles either. That said, it helps with both of those issues, enough so that I&#x27;d happily use this product again.  The dispenser is cleverly designed.</li>
    <li> This stuff does wonders for dark circles under my eyes.  A few minutes after applying it you can feel the skin under the eyes become tighter.  About 10-15 minutes later my eyes look MUCH less tired and the dark areas are nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its expensive stuff but you don&#x27;t need much at all so I think the container will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve found this to work a lot better than any under eye roller I have tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend who constantly suffers from tired, baggy eyes. He&#x27;s only been using it for a couple of days and I already see improvement in his bags. I&#x27;m hoping with more consistent use, it will improve even more. It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but nothing else has worked for him. So far, I&#x27;m impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Have tried a lot of different eye treatments but they don&#x27;t seem to work or if they do, you have to be on them for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;This cream WORKS....within a couple of days you will notice the difference. If you do buy this, i would suggest applying both the cream and the gel at the same time...it&#x27;s more effective that way.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it genuinely works yet, but it did arrive a day early! I think this is a product that you need to use over time to get results. However, my father is an air traffic controller who swears by it. I stay up late nights in college.</li>
    <li> Decent product for the price.</li>
    <li> ok this stuff works and last a long time too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably a little young to be using this (26), and I&#x27;m sure not it is actually helpful.  It makes me feel better about my face, and I definitely see firmer, healthy skin.</li>
    <li> This eye cream seems to be working well so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it has helped with the slight bags under my eyes that I have some days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I purchased it is to get rid of the black and blue I have in the corners under my eyes. It seems to be helping so far but not quiet there yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one major complaint I have is the bottle is not very durable. It simply fell off my sink and broke into several pieces. The pumps are now broken but I can still get the product out.</li>
    <li> This product is total crap.  Do not waste your money on it.  I have been using it for over a month, and notice absolutely no positive difference.  I do however notice that is makes the pores in the bags under my eyes stand out even more, so its essentially drawing more attention to an area i want less attention on.  This product sucks.</li>
    <li> I see some difference on the skin around my eyes, but I wanted something for my dark circles.</li>
    <li> I did see a difference initially but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> No it didn&#x27;t work as I had an allergic reaction a very serious one at that  to this produce line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several eye creams with indifferent results, and this stuff actually works. Be careful if you drop it (as i did); the springs working the pump action came out.</li>
    <li> Works better than previously tried product (Nivea). Noticeable difference after first use. has decreased depth of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning, it works really well for the dark bags under my eyes. I wish that that pump was easier to use, when the lotion comes out it seems half of it is always left on the bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is great, I have noticed a visible difference after only a few minutes, I use this in conjunction with the Kyoku moisturizer for my face and it feels great, not greasy and does not clog pores either.</li>
    <li> This actually is a descent product.  It does help with the appearance of tired eyes but don&#x27;t buy it thinking it will eliminate crows feet.  Its also nice because it is not greasy and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> nice product, expect no miracles but I did notice some improvements with my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> again, Kyoku makes a great mens product...its a two layer, an caffeine infused with plain on cucumber..one small squirt gets under both eyes, then the other goes over that and brightens that area since working 60 hour weeks, tends to wear a person out, but you can&#x27;t tell  the circles under my eye, which Kyoku removes</li>
    <li> I tried a little test and only used it one eye for 2 weeks.  I thought it might be making a little difference, but not sure.  I asked my wife which eye looked better and she picked the other one.  I also got an eye infection but not sure if there is any correlation to using this product or not.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for me</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this and will not repurchase. Does not feel moisturizing and the gel part irritated my under eye area.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles and have tried all the eye creams on the market.  I like this one best. I start with the gel on the left hand side and let it dry for 10 minutes or so.  Then I apply the whitening cream.  Not amazing, but pretty damn good.  Works great with photographs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third time buying on Amazon.  I will continue if the price stays this low.</li>
    <li> One of the best eye creams I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Since I hit 43, yes as a dude I use products (sigh), decades of working outside have finally started to show up on my face and I&#x27;m happy to say this eye stuff really works great, even the girlfriend is using it</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference using this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference when i used it and the gel side did not have anything left in it after a couple of use. Maybe there should be a see thru window so you can see if it has anything in it.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed this product after about a months use.  The combo cream/gel in the single container works great for travel.</li>
    <li> Definitely refreshing. Expensive yes, but lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks. I don&#x27;t know if I can see any difference at this point.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any appreciable reduction in bags, even after a month+ of use.  However, it gives my eyes a refreshed feeling in the morning, which anyone can appreciate!</li>
    <li> moisturises.....thats it...could also use vaseline jrelly seems it would do the same thing. was hopeing for something more but what can you do. Keep ya money.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; great price</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. One squirt from each side and apply. It lasts FOREVER. Do it every night and you will feel and see results.</li>
    <li> Used as directed.  Absolutely no results.  Complete waste of money. Also bought cleanser and scrub.  Nothing special. Am now looking for a new line of products to try.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This fuel has done wonders during the last semester of my undergraduate career. If only I had discovered it sooner. Would highly recommend to any college student.</li>
    <li> After several months of use there is no difference in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Received the product and one side didn&#x27;t work at all and the other side is worthless by itself.  Contacted the seller and they didn&#x27;t even bother responding.</li>
    <li> Fantastic men&#x27;s product that visibly works. Great price also. It lasts a long time. I like the dual product application of it also. I showed it to my dermatologist and she was impressed enough to start selling this product for men in her office. Men want to stay young looking too, and a lot of the women&#x27;s products just do not seem to work as well on men&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> very nice, soft item understated but powerful tool to combat aging for us guys</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for about two weeks and I&#x27;m noticing a slight difference in the dark circles under my eyes.. So I&#x27;m going to continue to apply every night and see where that gets me.</li>
    <li> I only gave this product 4 stars because it is a little on the expensive side.&lt;br /&gt;But it works great, I get compliments on my eyes all the time.</li>
    <li> great product, but dont accidetally drop it. the dispenser is not very durable.</li>
    <li> Works great for the tired look under your eyes. Decided to try it on foreskin, the tension feeling around the end of my knob was incredible!</li>
    <li> Help with the puffy eyes and firms up the skin under the eye. Great product!</li>
    <li> Really works and not too shiny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I do not see any difference. It feels nice to put on but my circles are still as prominent as they were before. On to the next product...</li>
    <li> I love these products, but the last two bottles of eye fuel I&#x27;ve bought have had issues with the gel either drying up or being non existent. I just want a replacement, but all I&#x27;ve been offered are refunds. It&#x27;s become too frustrating to purchase this product any more.</li>
    <li> I would never dare use such products and I am not interested in these type of moisturizers or whatever skin improver. However, a good friend of mine suggested this product line and suggested I tell others to use high quality products to enhance one&#x27;s skin. I tried it out and didn&#x27;t see much difference (then again I&#x27;m not that old). However, one day I did an all nighter project and had a meeting in the morning. I washed my face and applied this product. By the time I presented, no one noticed the darkening of my eyes or asked if I was tired. To others, it appeared as if I am as healthy as an ox. I decided to keep this product and works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have darkening around the eyes, crows feet, or uneven tones...this thing works! I suggest use a water drop size for each eye as too much would just be a waste. Stay Youthful Lads!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, would not purchase again</li>
    <li> the actual product is good - but the packaging is ridiculous. It&#x27;s for a man - therefore it should be designed to go in a gym bag. It&#x27;s not. The lettering rubbed off after about 3 weeks. The cap never stayed on - ever. The cap actually broke after about 6 months - not that it mattered - but the lack of cap made it necessary to wipe down the tips every time I used it - which was about 5 days a week. I finally ran out of the product yesterday. Going forward I&#x27;m going to try something else instead. I might come back to this - but I&#x27;m looking for quality - and it needs to be the entire thing - product and the thing it comes in.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few weeks religiously and I can honestly say I don&#x27;t know if it works as well as I expected. But I have been using the entire Kyoku line and have been getting compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes that it might work but not a chance and did not see any improvement and used it for 3 weeks consistently.  Also this is a dual product with one side  a gel and another side a cream.  It said you could use both in conjunction with each other so I did for the most part but always used the gel.  In all fairness it may not work with everyone.  Did some research on eye circles and there are a lot of causes and natural remedies such as more Vitamin A &amp; C, drink lots of water, dietary considerations etc.  I&#x27;m now working on those aspects and hope it will help.  Good luck to you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college student with a rather demanding degree.  Needless to say I&#x27;ve stayed up studying late more times than I care to remember.  Adding to that, I hereditarily have dark circles under my eyes.  The combination of these 2 leaves me looking VERY tired (puffy, dark circles).  I also tend to smile a lot, which causes the little wrinkles to form around my eyes.  I have used nearly every high end eye lotion there is (clinique, anthony, jack black, kiehls, and lab series).  Literally none of these made any significant improvements, I&#x27;m not sure I even noticed any change at all with them (the most effective out of the bunch was clinique&#x27;s eye fuel).  I figured I&#x27;d try kyoku out since it wasn&#x27;t very expensive and I was already purchasing some things from amazon.  The first day I used this I didn&#x27;t really notice any significant changes, the second day I used the eye fuel before I went to class (10am class).  I washed my face before I used it and then applied it.  I made breakfast, ate, and went back to brush my teeth and noticed the change around my eyes.  The little fine lines were nearly gone, and I didn&#x27;t look nearly as tired as I had before.  This truly does make me sound like a snake oil salesman, and I honestly doubt I will be believed about my experience, but I know this stuff works insanely well for me!  I apply it twice a day and it just works.  If I wasn&#x27;t such a poor college student, I would try some of kyoku&#x27;s other products due to how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down fall was the &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; seem to have came loose during shipping, i popped them back on and it seems fine now.  Also, sometimes the pump will suck air and you have to press it a few times before anything comes out...which is usually much more than you need, unexpectedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this stuff a try! It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Let&#x27;s start there. Really works. Your eyes look less tired, less puffy, less dark, almost right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting it to pump evenly from both sides is tricky. Mixing it up is an extra step. The consistency is waterier than I&#x27;d like, and that means it takes more energy to rub it in. But it&#x27;s neutral and doesn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest points off - the dispenser has broken 3 times traveling before - when none of my other bottles have.</li>
    <li> Works great for waking up and feels good but fails to mask the dark circles and bags as well as some other stuff I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Feels great, cool sensation and wakes me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t work as well as advertised when you have puffy or baggy eyes after a long day at the office.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no miracle worker but it does work a little.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, although don&#x27;t expect to much from it. It is really just a moisturizer that helps with tired eyes. It will not get rid of any lines or wrinkles, but it will help brighten the eye area a bit when applied.</li>
    <li> Works great after about 5 minutes. Definitely helps hide the effects of last night and or lack of sleep. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great for general upkeep.  I use it mainly when poorly rested and my eyes look a-wreck.  Gets the job done.</li>
</ol>
