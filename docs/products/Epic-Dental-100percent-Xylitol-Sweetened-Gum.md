      <li>I love this stuff!</li>

      <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the titanium dioxide in this gum unless you intend to ground it into a very fine powder and snort it.</li>

      <li>Love having smooth teeth!</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s non-GMO.</li>
      <li>so, I set about finding an affordable way to chew gum and to help my teeth be healthy....</li>
      <li>So just a heads up.season - ensuring top soil quality\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, I am able to talk better.</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for.  </li>
      <li>I am ordering more as soon as I finish this review.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m no fan of mystery ingredients or titanium dioxide, found in a million non-food items like deodorant, which some say isn&#x27;t even safe there.</li>
      <li>sure he has Xyitol in his toothpaste.</li>
      <li>but the price could be better.</li>
      <li>I like this xylitol gum much better than xlear&#x27;s gum...  </li>
      <li>Ok for one time use.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>They hand plant their corn between rows of vegetables and trees, rotating crops every season - ensuring top soil quality\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to order another brand of xylitol mints with better ingredients, [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>And amazon&#x27;s quick deliver is always amazing.</li>
      <li>Sure the flavor is fine, but who knows about the standards of its production in China.</li>
      <li>I wish more flavors were available in these containers.</li>
      <li>The flavor is good, but it wears off pretty fast (like many xylitol gums).  </li>
      <li>and it seems to be helping to keep their teeth cavity free.</li>
      <li>great product - the only thing i didn&#x27;t like is the plastic jar.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, as far as taste and quality goes, Epic has some excellent stuff, and I have never had any issues with any of their products.  </li>
      <li>so I use it after eating as a way to clean my teeth and prevent plaque</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed many different Xylitol products from different companies, and Epic is one of the best in terms of quality.  </li>
      <li>Read it and know it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>This gum is for you, if you like Juicy Fruit gum or if you like sweet gums...</li>
      <li>found out that titanium dioxide might not be good for you, so I&#x27;ll try something else next time.</li>
      <li>I thought this might be too sweet</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s good for my teeth at the same time, what a deal!</li>
      <li>it tastes good, but the flavor needs to last longer.</li>
      <li>healthy stuff, but flavor fades much faster than aspartame gum.</li>
      <li>gift purchase, arrived quickly, as described</li>
      <li>The sweetness runs out really quickly though.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s super delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be sure to read the entire label, it&#x27;s hilarious.</li>
      <li>The flavor also lasts a long time and the price is a good value, I think.</li>
      <li>A longer lasting taste than other xylitol gums and more xylitol per piece which makes it a very good bacteria fighter for teeth.</li>
      <li>This gum is sweet and has Great flavor, like old trident mixed fruit.  </li>
      <li>It stays soft and keeps moistening your mouth for more than 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>It was worth it.</li>
      <li>Xylichew is not made in China and contains no artificial flavors or titanium dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It is very tasty and refreshing while it keeps my mouth very  moist.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed this gum until I read the packaging more carefully.</li>
      <li>I purchase this product regularly for my wife,  who has Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome,  which affects the body&#x27;s ability to produce saliva on is own and cleanse the mouth.</li>
      <li>Really useful product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are so few gums out there without aspartame in them, this is very nice.</li>
      <li>As with most xylitol gums, it is great, but the flavor lasts for only a little while.</li>
      <li>With the price this company gets for this gum you&#x27;d think they could be less greedy about profit margins and have it manufactured in a country that doesn&#x27;t systematically poison their foods with whatever handy substance is available at any given moment.</li>
      <li>I originally bought a small box from my dentist as he said the xylitol helped prevent tooth decay, and I loved the taste.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I chew this after most of my meals and it works really well to clean my teeth (about the only reason I chew gum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so few gums out there without aspartame in them, this is very nice.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but xylitol gum has helped my youngest to stop having cavities all the time.  Daughter said it had very good flavor!</li>
    <li> Good gum...but the price could be better. Taste does not last as long but at least its healthier than chewing regular gum.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Xlear Xylitol Cinnamon gum.  This &amp;#34;fresh fruit&amp;#34; was larger pieces than the Xlear, but the flavor seemed to go away even faster than the Xlear Cinnamon.  Maybe due to flavor more than brand?</li>
    <li> The price is right, but the gum does not hold its flavor long enough.  I prefer XYLICHEW for lasting flavor and pieces of a slightly larger size.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed many different Xylitol products from different companies, and Epic is one of the best in terms of quality.  This fruit flavored gum is pretty much identical tasting to Spry&#x27;s fresh fruit (basically a Juicy Fruit type of flavor), and I would imagine it is also very close in taste to Xylichew&#x27;s fruit flavor as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like ALL other Xylitol products (including Xylichew, just read the reviews) the flavor does not last, and this is something that will always be an issue with pure Xylitol flavored gums.  In my opinion this shouldn&#x27;t reflect the products rating as it is simply a universal issue with Xylitol.  If a gum uses 100% Xylitol for it&#x27;s sweetening, it will have identical flavor-loss to ANY other brand.  Nevertheless, as far as taste and quality goes, Epic has some excellent stuff, and I have never had any issues with any of their products.  Their gum pieces are slightly larger than Spry&#x27;s pieces, and the texture of the gum is quite chewy (can get very soft and chewy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, and somewhat of a rarity, the price for this gum (as it stands right now) is slightly under $11 for 150 pieces.  That is actually a better price per piece than Spry or Xylichew in this same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note it appears that Epic uses a similar, if not identical, supplier of Xylitol as Spry (Xlear).  Which means it is Chinese sourced Xylitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken from their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Where do you make it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epic Dental sourced our corn to a spectacular region of China where time&#x27;s stood still in the fields for generations. We marry that history and respect for the land with an ultra-progressive and eco-friendly processing plant to provide a perfect blend of tradition and technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our corn farmers remain strictly and proudly non-GMO (genetically modified organisms) and use no chemical fertilizers or pesticides. They hand plant their corn between rows of vegetables and trees, rotating crops every season - ensuring top soil quality\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to think most (if not all) Xylitol comes from Chinese sources... even Xylitol from Xylichew.  So just a heads up.season - ensuring top soil quality\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to think most (if not all) Xylitol comes from Chinese sources... even Xylitol from Xylichew.  So just a heads up.</li>
    <li> I like to use one piece of this gum as one of several exposures to xylitol during the day.  The flavor lasts just long enough to get the xylitol out of it.</li>
    <li> I like the this brand compared to other brands and the quality of xylitol they use seems to agree best.</li>
    <li> Very nice tasting and long lasting gum.  Pleasant to chew.  I don&#x27;t have anything else to say about the product.</li>
    <li> This gum is exactly what you would expect from Xylitol gum for a bargain price.  healthy stuff, but flavor fades much faster than aspartame gum.</li>
    <li> Flavor gone within a minute.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My kids love this stuff! And my dentist recommended it to help prevent cavities... Hopefully it works!</li>
    <li> it tastes good, but the flavor needs to last longer.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand. Soft. Fruit flavor is similar to the other brands. Flavor last long enough. Package is good too.</li>
    <li> This is great Xylitol-sweetened gum, tasty, long-lasting, but as poisonous and lethal to dogs as a bullet. If you have a dog who could get hold of your purse or other place you might keep gum, and the dog eats, say, two pieces of Xylitol-sweetened gum, you will have a dead dog who died a horrible death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a dog, buy it!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> flavor does not last.  And i wish it came in portable packaing like the dentyne  gum.  hard to carry around the bottle.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula for making this product, but it is not as good as it used to be. After about 2 minutes, the flavor is gone and the gum is hard. Will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Great gum when you need to freshen your teeth up a bit.  Just dont chew it too long or it will taste like....well...nothing.</li>
    <li> Really useful product. My teeth were getting damaged due to acidic saliva(work stress and all) and now my pH levels are in control(I check regularly). And amazon&#x27;s quick deliver is always amazing.</li>
    <li> The flavor is nice. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as other sweeteners, but xylitol leaves my mouth feeling cleaner. Most xylitol gum gets really stiff after a couple minutes, so you can&#x27;t make bubbles--Epic has a much better gum base, so it stays chewy for a very long time, and you can always make bubbles.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product regularly for my wife,  who has Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome,  which affects the body&#x27;s ability to produce saliva on is own and cleanse the mouth. It has probably saved her hundreds of dollars in preventing  tooth decay.  She loves it !!</li>
    <li> I thought this might be too sweet but the flavor is very nice. The flavor also lasts a long time and the price is a good value, I think.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended xylitol gum for me and I found the Epic Dental gum to be tasty and full of xylitol.  The flavor lasts a fairly long time too.</li>
    <li> This gum is sweet and has Great flavor, like old trident mixed fruit.  Two pieces was good for a snack.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to Trident and other sugar free gum because those were causing some... erm, unpleasant side effects, not too dissimilar from the Haribo Sugar-Free Gummy Bears.  My pregnancy has been causing a bad taste in my mouth, and gum fixes that, except sometimes I end up chewing a pack a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to xylitol based gum to see if that helped. So far, no side effects, but I&#x27;m going to try a different gum than this one. This gum loses its flavor after a couple minutes or less, then I feel like I&#x27;m chewing a piece of wax (like Chiclets gum). The taste, while it&#x27;s there, is also very bland. It does its job, but it just can&#x27;t match the juicy flavor of, say, Orbit&#x27;s Strawberry Remix gum. That&#x27;s super delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the other reviews about this being &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; or containing titanium dioxide... strangely the bottles I received had the &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; label covered up with a sticker. Not sure why. But I don&#x27;t care about titanium dioxide. It&#x27;s found in virtually anything you consume that needs an opaque whiteness (paper, white paint, candies, toothpaste, dairy products, makeup, and so on). It doesn&#x27;t cause cancer unless you&#x27;re inhaling a lot of it as a powder (and, guess what, very fine sand, AKA silicon dioxide, will do that too). So I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the titanium dioxide in this gum unless you intend to ground it into a very fine powder and snort it. In which case, you&#x27;re a very silly person.</li>
    <li> It is very tasty and refreshing while it keeps my mouth very  moist. Also, I am able to talk better.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a gum, that had a healthy sweetener and tasted great. These are good. I can keep them in my purse as needed and they have a good flavor. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s tasty and it seems to work. My mouth is less icky in that plaquey way. I wish more flavors were available in these containers.</li>
    <li> The taste is a bit different than your typical sugar or sorbitol sweatened fruity gum, but at least for me it wasn&#x27;t any worse, just different. I am not a compulsive chewer, but I will chew gum a lot when I do have it at hand, so I can easily go through an entire 50-pack in a day. The biggest plus is that unlike sugar-sweetened gum it&#x27;s not going to be comparably damanging to my teeth to do so, and unlike sorbitol-sweatened gum, xylitol isn&#x27;t a laxative in high-enough doses.</li>
    <li> I eat these three at a time to get a nice-sized chunk of gum. They really do clean my teeth off, and taste great, just like Juicyfruit gum (Which I understand is Jackfruit flavor! Interesting!)! And it&#x27;s good for my teeth at the same time, what a deal! Be sure to read the entire label, it&#x27;s hilarious. Great company!</li>
    <li> gum tastes okay but the flavor only lasts about 3 minutes!</li>
    <li> My family and I enjoyed this gum a lot. I tried several flavors and my kids all picked this one. I like it as well and would recommend it. It is a great way to get the benefits of Xylitol. I am ordering more as soon as I finish this review.</li>
    <li> This is the best gum. My grandson is 2 almost 3 and he loves it. His dentist told his mom to&lt;br /&gt;make sure he has Xyitol in his toothpaste. It taste better than the other gums with sugar in it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s truly amazing how quickly this gum loses flavor.  At this point I&#x27;m just trying to get rid of it so I&#x27;m letting my kids chew as much of it as they want to whereas usually, I covet and ration my xylitol gum. I will definitely not be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> This gum tastes great and has a great price.  But I&#x27;m also not a big fan of products coming from China due to their lack of regulations. I&#x27;ll buy the american version as soon as I find it.</li>
    <li> gift purchase, arrived quickly, as described</li>
    <li> Thank you received the order in excellent condition</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars but I admit the flavor doesn&#x27;t last all that long. Not many sugarfree gums do, though, so it really doesn&#x27;t bother me. It has the hint of flavor for the whole time you&#x27;re chewing it. What really makes me like this gum is the perfect texture. I also have been recommended xylitol by my dentist-- he told me that bacteria injest the sweetener but instead of making them thrive, it kills them. So far, this gum is my solution to afternoon sweets cravings; it definitely keeps me from mindlessly popping food/sweets in my mouth while working. I like the big container, too, rather than having to pop out each individual piece (very loud at the movies). I agree with the rec of chewing two pieces at once, otherwise they&#x27;re too small.</li>
    <li> The sweetness runs out really quickly though.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dentist. Nice refreshing taste. The kids really like it and it seems to be helping to keep their teeth cavity free.</li>
    <li> As with most xylitol gums, it is great, but the flavor lasts for only a little while. Still, it helps your teeth and is pleasant for the first little while!</li>
    <li> I was trying keep my little baseball players off of all the chemical-laden gums in the dugout and this gum has succeeded!  The flavor is good, but it wears off pretty fast (like many xylitol gums).  That&#x27;s why I got such a large amount so that we can keep it fresh.  It was worth it.</li>
    <li> It is not the best quality product but not the worst product either. The price is very acceptable and reasonable. I&#x27;d like to strongly recommend this product if you seek a product with normal quality and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> great product - the only thing i didn&#x27;t like is the plastic jar.</li>
    <li> A longer lasting taste than other xylitol gums and more xylitol per piece which makes it a very good bacteria fighter for teeth.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this gum! ;-)</li>
    <li> I have not had much fun chewing gum in the last few years, mostly because I didn&#x27;t want to chew all the stuff they list as ingredients in most gums... however, a dentist turned me on to this Xylitol sugar and says it&#x27;s good for your teeth and gums... so, I set about finding an affordable way to chew gum and to help my teeth be healthy.... Here it is folks. Read it and know it&#x27;s true. This gum is for you, if you like Juicy Fruit gum or if you like sweet gums... try their spearmint if you&#x27;d rather have a minty favor.</li>
    <li> The  gum has great flavor but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again for two reasons: It is somewhat costly and the flavor doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> With the price this company gets for this gum you&#x27;d think they could be less greedy about profit margins and have it manufactured in a country that doesn&#x27;t systematically poison their foods with whatever handy substance is available at any given moment. I wonder how often Epic independently tests their products for contaminants. Remember the fire retardant in milk...the antifreeze in tooth paste? That&#x27;s just what you hear about in the news. Having spent time in China, I strive very hard not to put anything produced there in my body and that will include this gum.</li>
    <li> flavor is gone after about 1 minute. found out that titanium dioxide might not be good for you, so I&#x27;ll try something else next time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely gobbled this gum down. If anything, I may have started chewing it obsessively! But at a couple of calories a piece, it&#x27;s all good. I originally bought a small box from my dentist as he said the xylitol helped prevent tooth decay, and I loved the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the flavor does not last super-long, but that&#x27;s an issue with most chewing gums.</li>
    <li> The flavor of other mint-flavored xylitol gum last so much longer. Won&#x27;t buy the fruit flavor again. Love the xylitol, not the short lasting flavor.</li>
    <li> This gum tastes great. Pieces are like Chicklets.  You need 2-3 after a meal to give slight protection to teeth until time to brush.</li>
    <li> These taste great and are good for your teeth. They lose their flavor as fast as any other fruit gum, but that&#x27;s par for the course.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this gum until I read the packaging more carefully. The gum is made in China and contains the following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xylitol, gum base, natural and artificial flavors, soy lecithin, gum arabic, titatium dioxide, carnauba wax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food items on Amazon should really list the ingredients on the site so consumers may make choices knowing what they&#x27;re really getting. I&#x27;m going to order another brand of xylitol mints with better ingredients, [[ASIN:B001E5E326 XyliChew Sugar Free Mints, Peppermint, 240-Count Jars (Pack of 2)]], to replace the subscription I had to this gum made by Epic.</li>
    <li> Xylitol really makes a difference for this cavity prone family. Not cheap but better than filling cavities. Love having smooth teeth!</li>
    <li> This sugar-free gum has helped me to manage problems with a dry mouth. I can&#x27;t use mint flavored products so this has been appreciated.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this gum. I love the convience of the 50 count bottle. The flavor fades after about 10 minutes but that&#x27;s long enough for the benefit.</li>
    <li> Dentist told me I had the beginnings of a cavity on one of my molars.  I started feeling pain when chewing with that tooth.  Did some research and bought these.  Chewed through a pack of these for half a year or so.  No more pain, whatsoever so I&#x27;m convinced it did the job.</li>
    <li> Gum is great.  Not very portable, though, because the chicklet-type gum rattles around in the bottle wherever it goes.</li>
    <li> My dents recommended that I chew Xylitol sweetened gum to help combat my very dry mouth. I like the long-lasting flavor as well as the gum&#x27;s ability to moisten. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Ok for one time use. Contains know carcinogens like titanium dioxide. Made in China.</li>
    <li> great taste, good for your teeth</li>
    <li> Delicious gum...  I bought it for my kids and we ended up chewing a fair amount as well...  You should definitely not use this around pets because Xylitol can be very toxic to dogs, even in relatively small amounts.  So be careful how you dispose of this and research a little ahead of time.  Overall, I believe the benefits (my son has poor enamel) are considerable, but the recommended amount for a positive effect in 6 pieces per day so know that going in as well!  150 / 6 pieces per day &#x3D; 25 day supply for 1 person.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Made in China.&lt;br /&gt;With todays issues with dishonesty in food I don&#x27;t trust the label made in China for food items.</li>
    <li> Very tasty and doesn&#x27;t loose flavor!  I like to know that when chewing I am helping my teeth! Just wish it could be in stores!</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery</li>
    <li> The Epic Fruit flavor is the best of the four flavors they have. It tastes similar to Juicy Fruit but better in my opinion. The gum is slightly more expensive than regular come but you save the money in dental bills not to mention that xylitol has a very low glycemic index so its much better for your system.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s non-GMO. We use Epic gum for the whole family.</li>
    <li> My boys have started using this in place of regular gum due to their susceptibility to cavities.  They have declared it &amp;#34;the best gum ever&amp;#34;. I even carry it in my purse too, bc it&#x27;s got a nice flavor.  And if it helps fight tooth issues while chewing, well why wouldn&#x27;t you switch over?</li>
    <li> Sweeter than I like, but my son is happy...</li>
    <li> The best Xylitol gum I have tried ! It&#x27;s not like the others that feel like silly putty after two minutes of chewing. It stays soft and keeps moistening your mouth for more than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> This gum really tastes like Juicy Fruit, but the taste doesn&#x27;t last long. Xylitol is the only sweetener so I use it after eating as a way to clean my teeth and prevent plaque (I hope.) If you don&#x27;t mind the shortness of flavor, this is really good gum.</li>
    <li> The ingredients were disappointing</li>
    <li> This gum works for me, great mild taste,  and the hygienist says it&#x27;s good for your teeth.  What more could you ask for.  Slight issue is that you have to chew 6 pieces of this gum (or any of its flavor cousins) a day.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with that, but some might.</li>
    <li> I have used this gum for a few years now - the taste is so great - but the flavour is gone in like 10 mins or so. I don&#x27;t care though - its still good for your teeth and gums, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I like this xylitol gum much better than xlear&#x27;s gum...  Tastes a lot like juicy fruit.  Still doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s flavor for long, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find any natural gum that does...</li>
    <li> Ingredients should really be posted for food items. So here they are for this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Xylitol, Gum Base, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Soy Lecithin, Gum Arabic, Titanium Dioxide, Carnauba Wax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Made in China, packaged in the USA&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend &amp;#34;Xylichew&amp;#34; over this stuff. Xylichew is not made in China and contains no artificial flavors or titanium dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this brand is cheaper is for reasons I&#x27;d rather not use it. Sure the flavor is fine, but who knows about the standards of its production in China. And I&#x27;m no fan of mystery ingredients or titanium dioxide, found in a million non-food items like deodorant, which some say isn&#x27;t even safe there.</li>
    <li> I chew a lot of gum because I cannot drink caffeinated drinks.  This gum seems to keep flavor for a while and I like the fact that it is made from Xylitol.  I recommend it!</li>
