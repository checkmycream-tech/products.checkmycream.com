      <li>Be sure not to get the waterproof!  </li>
      <li>It goes on nicely and emphasizes my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it.  </li>
      <li>I love how they make us write words even when we are done.</li>
      <li>It takes many coats and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
      <li>I love using this mascara, of course when it&#x27;s not raining.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>Perfect for any occasion and lasts all day long!</li>
      <li>Also great for sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>Regardless or not if it is the product or not Covergirl showing two items instead of one is still misleading and 1/2 of any product most certainly has to do with the item.</li>
      <li>I love to try new mascara.</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara, not too heavy, effective brush, not problems.</li>
      <li>Another good thing about this is that it washes away easy enough, not causing you to scrub or apply other makeup removing products to remove.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased this same exact mascara for years at Target or Walmart etc and love it, so I decided to just buy five of them here on amazon</li>
      <li>I love this product and used it for years but recently could not find it on the store shelves (went to Target, Walmart, RiteAid, and CVS...</li>
      <li>Luckily for me I found a new mascara (not CoverGirl though)</li>
      <li>so I am sure it is indeed a new mascara, but I could only use it once</li>
      <li>Absolutely will never purchase CG mascara ever again.</li>
      <li>and my eye didn&#x27;t burn as much.</li>
      <li>Really Like This Product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect too much, but was pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>Normally it would take me a couple months so to go through a tube.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I was already shopping and needed a new one</li>
      <li>Great mascara that doesn&#x27;t leave behind marks on your upper eyelid, nor does it flake half-way through the day.  </li>
      <li>Purchased a tube here on Amazon and while it appeared new and was in the original packaging, it was somewhat dry and only lasted about a week.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I just got an old one.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t look clumpy or too heavy.</li>
      <li>and I could barely spread it through my lashes.</li>
      <li>It barely covers your lashes.  </li>
      <li>I really like the other cover girl mascara.</li>
      <li>It arrived dry and the package was old and brown like it had been on a shelf somehere for years.</li>

    <li> Really Like This Product. Thank You For The Wonderful Service.</li>
    <li> I opened this mascara from closed packaging so I am sure it is indeed a new mascara, but I could only use it once and it was horrible. The mascara was extremely dry and I could barely spread it through my lashes. It was almost as if it had been sitting out and went dry, but again, I did open the package. I don&#x27;t know if mascara expires or not, but this was horrible. I&#x27;ve always used Covergirl but have purchased in the past from retail stores. I bought this because I was already shopping and needed a new one so I thought I&#x27;d just order to save myself the time of going to the store. Bad decision..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda a dry mascara.  I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara, not too heavy, effective brush, not problems. It&#x27;s hard to find locally so Amazon is my go-to supplier.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t tell you are wearing it. It takes many coats and I don&#x27;t like that. I still use it because I have to, but I use it with another brand</li>
    <li> I love to try new mascara. You never know when you will find that elusive perfect for you product. I hate to say I was really disappointed in this one. It was dry and had hardly any mascara in it when it arrived. However I do like the brush. Maybe I just got an old one.</li>
    <li> Was this mascara sitting in a warehouse for years? Need to add water just to get it on the brush. Will not order makeup on Amazon again.</li>
    <li> It seemed to be dry and stayed that way. I couldn&#x27;t use it for long. I love how they make us write words even when we are done.</li>
    <li> Great mascara that doesn&#x27;t leave behind marks on your upper eyelid, nor does it flake half-way through the day.  Another good thing about this is that it washes away easy enough, not causing you to scrub or apply other makeup removing products to remove.  I love this product and used it for years but recently could not find it on the store shelves (went to Target, Walmart, RiteAid, and CVS... couldn&#x27;t find). Purchased a tube here on Amazon and while it appeared new and was in the original packaging, it was somewhat dry and only lasted about a week.  Normally it would take me a couple months so to go through a tube.  Luckily for me I found a new mascara (not CoverGirl though) that I like and can buy in the stores.  UPDATE: Found this at Target the other day... it is now in a pink container under the same name.  So glad I found it.  Be sure not to get the waterproof!

    <li> Absolutely will never purchase CG mascara ever again. Worst mascara. Flakes and seems to refuse to stay on my lashes.  Smears like no body&#x27;s business.  Weighs down my lashes &amp; makes them look so bad.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara I ever bought.  It barely covers your lashes.  The case cracked within one week after I bought it.  I would never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I foolishly assumed from the picture, and as somebody that never buys mascara, that as two of them are shown I would get two.  I hope nobody else is fooled and I do believe this is misleading advertising. Regardless or not if it is the product or not Covergirl showing two items instead of one is still misleading and 1/2 of any product most certainly has to do with the item.</li>
    <li> best mascara i&#x27;ve ever had. Can&#x27;t believe I ever stopped using it. Perfect for any occasion and lasts all day long!</li>
    <li> I love using this mascara, of course when it&#x27;s not raining. lol  It goes on nicely and emphasizes my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Very great product love it. And does not wash away in the rain or if tears are in my eyes. Also great for sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I really like the other cover girl mascara. It&#x27;s the purple package one, but I think it was irritating my eyes when I wore contacts. I gave these one a try and my eye didn&#x27;t burn as much. I also like that they don&#x27;t clump. It goes on pretty thick and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this same exact mascara for years at Target or Walmart etc and love it, so I decided to just buy five of them here on amazon so I wouldn&#x27;t keep running out and not having one.  EVERY ONE of the 5 was as dry as a bone.  I had to throw them away as soon as I opened them.  Very disappointed that I bought 5 and wasted $30!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying to find a good mascara that&#x27;s not clumpy. I didn&#x27;t expect too much, but was pleasantly surprised! It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t look clumpy or too heavy. This is one that I would probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I should have read reviews before purchasing, as I see somebody else also thought they were getting qty 2 of these (as I did) based on the photo.  Now that I carefully read the description, I see that it doesn&#x27;t state a qty of 2.  Photo is misleading still.  I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet so can&#x27;t review it&#x27;s quality yet.</li>
    <li> It arrived dry and the package was old and brown like it had been on a shelf somehere for years. I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back because it was only a few bucks. But I really was unhappy with the purchase, the product was flaky and dry and I could not even use it.</li>
