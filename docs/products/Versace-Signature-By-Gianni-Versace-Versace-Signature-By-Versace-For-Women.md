      <li>We thought it was too good to be true when we found it on amazon, and it was!</li>
      <li>When I wear it, I always get compliments and especially, I love my husbands&#x27; reaction the best; it drives him wild and we&#x27;re OLD!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so elegant and sexy!</li>
      <li>This perfume is one of my all time top 3 perfumes ~ I LOVE this perfume!</li>
      <li>The romantic scent is purely beautiful and when I wear it, I feel even more beautiful.</li>

      <li>I wear Lovely  and get compliments all the time.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love Versace and this is a lovely scent.</li>

      <li>cuz i love it..</li>
      <li>I was excited to see that it was available here, it&#x27;s my very favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>It smells just like my first bottle, Lovely!  </li>
      <li>I am so happy to find it on Amazon, my bottle arrived quickly, well packaged in a new cello wrapped box in the original package.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted, Love the fragrance..</li>
      <li>This perfume is wonderful to say the least...</li>
      <li>manufacturer describes the scent as &amp;#34;transparent and elegant signature scent, floral and refined with subtle and mouthwatering fruit tones&amp;#34; and although I can&#x27;t describe it as accurately as that, I can safely say that it has a very rich and luxurious flowery and fruity scent thats not too strong or too weak.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
      <li>Classy parfumerie , using for 5 years and can&#x27;t be with out it, I got so many compliments from men .</li>
      <li>Bought a long time ago when the perfume was still popular in 2011.</li>
      <li>Versace alone is pure elegance!</li>
      <li>Raising my sons alone, I couldn&#x27;t afford very much.</li>
      <li>This was my first time to try Versace Signature.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s similar but the bouquet is a bit more floral.</li>
      <li>That perfume and this one are my absolute favorites!</li>
      <li>u dont need anything esle;).</li>
      <li>so I was surprised by that and was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>My other favorite perfume happens it be one that costs only $11.00 which my sons love and always remember wearing while they were growing up.</li>
      <li>wow what a great deal 41 bucks compared to what i usually get it for 96 thats with tax...</li>
      <li>Very feminine.</li>
      <li>the fragrances doesnt even stay long on like the true one!</li>
      <li>I love this perfume and just because i couldn&#x27;t find in any other store here I decided to order it from here.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is a classic scent.</li>
      <li>One of my favourites by far!!</li>
      <li>I normally buy this fragrance from macys</li>
      <li>i get the fragrance, the box wasnt sealed, the box looked different from what its supposed to look like i knew right away</li>
      <li>The hot stamped logo on the box looked different from the on used to have even dough</li>
      <li>So i was very disapointed because I wanted this perfume for present</li>
      <li>Both are worth it (but I won&#x27;t mention the other one).</li>
      <li>cuz usually you can find them for cheap...</li>
      <li>long lasting enough to be detected on clothes several hours after arriving home from work and overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Either it&#x27;s very old, or it has sat too long somewhere.</li>
      <li>I guess this is going out of stock or something in stores because I looked high and low in Macy&#x27;s and other department stores</li>

<li> (stale perfume is no fun) and I was hesitant to order online after reading some of the reviews but had run out of places to find this fragrance</li>
<li> i asked her are they fake</li>
<li> it was fake</li>
<li> This stuff is fake.</li>
<li> wtf!</li>
<li> , i take a closer look and it was the bottle, the box, everything was fake about it!</li>
<li> It was expensive and I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> was very disappointed after receiving it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, Love the fragrance..</li>
    <li> I was looking for this for years and now that I have found it I love it</li>
    <li> I bought 3.4 unc. Versace Signature, but I did&#x27;t know that it was tester and unboxed. So i was very disapointed because I wanted this perfume for present</li>
    <li> Sometimes you get what you pay for with perfumes and with this product you know you&#x27;ve got something special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It weighs 363g and is 15.2 x 12.7 x 10.2 cm in dimensions and it&#x27;s quite well presented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer describes the scent as &amp;#34;transparent and elegant signature scent, floral and refined with subtle and mouthwatering fruit tones&amp;#34; and although I can&#x27;t describe it as accurately as that, I can safely say that it has a very rich and luxurious flowery and fruity scent thats not too strong or too weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s long lasting enough to be detected on clothes several hours after arriving home from work and overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my wife.  She liked it. &#x27;nuff said</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume here on Amazon because it has been discontinued in stores, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. I was excited to see that it was available here, it&#x27;s my very favorite perfume. I was SO disappointed when I recived the product because it was a tester, so the scent is lighter and doesn&#x27;t last very long. The seller does not state that it is a tester. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Wish they still made this scent... Will buy it until I can no longer get it... One of my favorites..</li>
    <li> Classy parfumerie , using for 5 years and can&#x27;t be with out it, I got so many compliments from men . Put some  cocktail dress and this parfumerie  u dont need anything esle;).</li>
    <li> This is a classic scent. When I wear it... I always get compliments. It is a timeless fragrance. Recommended for all ages.</li>
    <li> This perfume is one of my all time top 3 perfumes ~ I LOVE this perfume! It&#x27;s so elegant and sexy! When I wear it, I always get compliments and especially, I love my husbands&#x27; reaction the best; it drives him wild and we&#x27;re OLD!!  I haven&#x27;t had a problem like others have mentioned about it not lasting long enough. Seems like it lasts a good 6 to 8 hours for me. I wear this gorgeous perfume whether I&#x27;m dressed up or in my jeans and t-shirt. Makes me feel wonderful! My other favorite perfume happens it be one that costs only $11.00 which my sons love and always remember wearing while they were growing up. Raising my sons alone, I couldn&#x27;t afford very much. That perfume and this one are my absolute favorites! Imagine, one that smells like it cost a lot and one that does. Both are worth it (but I won&#x27;t mention the other one). Versace alone is pure elegance! The romantic scent is purely beautiful and when I wear it, I feel even more beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love Versace and this is a lovely scent. For 2 seconds. That&#x27;s it, no fragrance. Either it&#x27;s very old, or it has sat too long somewhere. It was expensive and I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I guess this is going out of stock or something in stores because I looked high and low in Macy&#x27;s and other department stores but I found it here and for a great price. I am such an amazon junkie!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a similar scent to J&#x27;adore. It&#x27;s similar but the bouquet is a bit more floral. Very pleasant and it is a lasting fragrance cause it&#x27;s EdP.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and just because i couldn&#x27;t find in any other store here I decided to order it from here.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed after receiving it. The hot stamped logo on the box looked different from the on used to have even dough it smelled the same the odor doesn&#x27;t last for a long time just for an hour or two not more.</li>
    <li> I normally buy this fragrance from macys cuz i love it.. it smellls amazing! its just perfect so a friend of mine told me to search for it online on amazon cuz usually you can find them for cheap... i asked her are they fake she said no way would they be! so i go online i onder this one cuz i was like wow what a great deal 41 bucks compared to what i usually get it for 96 thats with tax... shipping was great.. i get the fragrance, the box wasnt sealed, the box looked different from what its supposed to look like i knew right away it was fake, i take a closer look and it was the bottle, the box, everything was fake about it! i was pissed! the fragrances doesnt even stay long on like the true one! wtf!</li>
    <li> Versace Signature... I loved this fragrance from day1!! Lasts all day. One of my favourites by far!!</li>
    <li> How many compliments does it take to become the best scent for a woman. Well, you will find out after using this luxuriously impression giving Perfume.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PERFUME! Versace is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, but we haven&#x27;t found it in stores for years. We thought it was too good to be true when we found it on amazon, and it was! This stuff is fake. Very disappointing. Amazon, get your act together!</li>
    <li> This was my first time to try Versace Signature. I would not order this again, I can&#x27;t smell it after a couple hours and I never get any compliments on it, so I know no one else smells it either. I wear Lovely  and get compliments all the time. Hope this is helpful</li>
    <li> Mi queridisima madre ama esta fragancia y cuando puedo se la compro definitivamente muy recomendable y el vendedor se porto a la altura muy cumplidos</li>
    <li> Bought a long time ago when the perfume was still popular in 2011. Its 2015 and I have a small amount of it and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I discovered my Mother spraying her sheets with this product.  She has dementia and doesn&#x27;t always do things the way she should.  It was a great break for me though.  This is now my favorite parfum.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it had a simuler smell like the Versace Signature for men. I gave this to one  of my grand daughters.</li>
    <li> FANT&amp;Aacute;STICO, UM PRODUTO SIMPLESMENTE AGRAD&amp;Aacute;VEL DE SE USAR...FOI UM EXCELENTE PRESENTE PARA MINHA ESPOSA, ELA &amp;Eacute; FÃ DOS PRODUTOS DA VERSACE, RECOMENDARIA A TODOS</li>
    <li> I fell for this Versace fragrance as soon as I smelled it.  I am so happy to find it on Amazon, my bottle arrived quickly, well packaged in a new cello wrapped box in the original package.  It smells just like my first bottle, Lovely!  I have purchased perfume before that was past it&#x27;s prime (stale perfume is no fun) and I was hesitant to order online after reading some of the reviews but had run out of places to find this fragrance so I took a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did!  I am more than pleased and the price was awesome for the 3.4 oz size.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> other reviews made me skeptical but I ordered anyway as I really like this scent and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally.  The bottle size was larger than the one I had so I was surprised by that and was not disappointed.  Scent is not overwhelming and lingers slightly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after noticing the scent on someone else.  Every time she wears it my nose knows.</li>
    <li> This perfume is wonderful to say the least... I get nothing but comments on the scent. It is so wonderful and I won&#x27;t change it any time soon</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this order.  The product was well packaged and the fragrance is awesome!  Will be reordering in future!</li>
    <li> I have alternated from this to Essencia De Duende depending on seasons for at least five years now. It is an amazing scent and I have found that when I use a charcoal soap instead of deodorant soap this sent enhances and lasts longer. Would not recommend the lotion though. Has no layering power at all. Great perfume, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and  arrived before scheduled!  I would purchase from this distributor again</li>
    <li> Scent was nice but gone in a flash from your body.  I felt like I was spraying water on me.  Wouldn&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Very feminine. When my kids hug me, they tell me I smell like Heaven:)</li>
