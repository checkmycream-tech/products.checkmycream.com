      <li>I have always found that the MoodMatchers were a great lip stain to some extent.  </li>
      <li>Great value.</li>
      <li>I wish I had just purchased one great lipstick that I could wear all the time.</li>
      <li>They do look great, though.</li>
      <li>Great lipstick for those gals who do not have the time to reapply color all the time.  </li>

      <li>The price is also great.  </li>
      <li>Nice lipsticks!  </li>

      <li>My favorite lipsticks!  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s still okay!).</li>
      <li>The colors would probably be most flattering to those who look best in cool tones.  </li>
      <li>HOW NICE IT LOOKS.</li>
      <li>It is nice that it changes with a person&#x27;s skin color.  </li>
      <li>I had some of these many years ago, and loved them.</li>
      <li>When I heard that this matches to your body&#x27;s chemistry, I was ecstatic - and in the end it does look nice.</li>
      <li>Hello my request I received a damaged nor suitable for use never</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and turns into a very nice color that is colorful but not too bright.</li>
      <li>I was excited to receive these lipsticks as I had used Fran Wilson shea butter lipsticks from QVC years ago and loved them.</li>
      <li>She was so excited and loved that I found them again.</li>
      <li>Love the look and feel, but wish it lasted longer.</li>
      <li>Across the top-</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>and I hope they stay around forever... :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many recommended lipsticks and none stay on the way the Fran Wilson ones do.  </li>
      <li>wont be buying any more of these.</li>
      <li>Also allows more creativity with color blending.</li>
      <li>and cheap!</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I ordered this 6 piece set.</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love these mood lipsticks.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;ve found them again, it&#x27;s wonderful to have color that actually LASTS on my lips.</li>
      <li>It took me a week trying one every day (and looking like a clown for most of them) to figure out that there wasn&#x27;t a mellow color in the pack.</li>
      <li>However, now, I find that the pinks match my skin tone and outfits better. :)</li>
      <li>Love these lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I had some from years ago and was glad to find them again.  </li>
      <li>I love these lipsticks because of their staying power.</li>
      <li>My wife has found this lipstick stays on longer than most lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that i never had chapped lips any more since i started wearing fran wilson.</li>
      <li>many years ago in the 80&#x27;s I believe it was I introduced my mother to the MoodMatchers.</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>Love these lipsticks.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>It does have good staying power, however it is pretty drying for me even though I apply a lip balm before the lipstick.</li>
      <li>It keeps the undertone of the original color, therefore, making your lips match!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it is available through Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I am happy with my most recent purchase of it.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t look that good on me, I was just hoping for either some more coral influence to show up or some more red to show up.</li>
      <li>Also, there is no bleeding  in fine lines around the  lips.</li>
      <li>Mom is once again Happily wearing her MoodMatchers Lips daily!  </li>
      <li>Every one of them was way too dark and bright!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what is particularly special about these, but they&#x27;re interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Understandably, they all turn your lips varying shades of the same bright fuschia shade.</li>
      <li>If you want bright, bold, and ever lasting, go for it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love my new lipstick!</li>
      <li>The product came quickly and with no issues</li>
      <li>I really like the colors that they end up becoming.</li>
      <li>The service was fast and easy.</li>
      <li>I was truly excited to find these lipsticks after so many years and many fond memories, but they&#x27;re nothing like I remember ... or perhaps it was because in the 80&#x27;s hot pink was the &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; to wear.</li>
      <li>it comes out as - it&#x27;s a bright pink.</li>
      <li>Speaking of vibrant color, they may match your mood, but only if your mood is bold and bright.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why they have not become popular enough to be in department stores.</li>
      <li>Still worth buying.</li>
      <li>My granddaughter and I had fun determining how each color would change.</li>
      <li>It is so fun.</li>
      <li>Really fun.</li>
      <li>fun lipstick -</li>
      <li>Fun for the kids.  </li>
      <li>The colors of these lipstick all came out really strong on me and all are pretty much variations on bright pink.</li>
      <li>I first found Fran Wilson lipsticks in 1992 and was quickly enamored of them.  </li>
      <li>You would be amazed how great the Blue looks with a pair of Blue Jeans!</li>
      <li>They all have a nice feel to them and are best used IMO as a stain or base under your preferred lip color.  </li>
      <li>My mom gave my sisters and I a similar set of changing lipsticks many years ago, and these are just as fun.</li>
      <li>some colors work better for me (a winter) than others - the pink, light green, and light blue are best for me - I like the way it goes on in that it gives a natural look and is not garish for someone with aging skin</li>
      <li>She enjoyed them till they stopped being sold locally.  </li>
      <li>Love it, last for hours!</li>
      <li>Most of the colors turn my lips the same color/hue when applied.  </li>
      <li>Then, I moved and could not find them in local retail stores for more than 20 years.  </li>
      <li>Moodmatchers are the only lipssticks I have bought in many years.</li>
      <li>This would make a cute Christmas stocking stuffer for teen girls.</li>
      <li>I love these lipsticks, they are moisturizing, they last all day, I have used this brand for years</li>
      <li>Love them, because of their lasting power</li>
      <li>This set actually has more colors.</li>
      <li>my wife loved it  wears it everyday  </li>
      <li>The light blue, the main reason I bought this turned bright pink.</li>
      <li>but i play beach volleyball and am really tan and no lipstick has really looked right on me</li>
      <li>The red turned my lips a rose red; I really like that colour!</li>
      <li>It always turns my lips a certain shade of light pinks, but i liked the blue and green ones.</li>

    <li> It always turns my lips a certain shade of light pinks, but i liked the blue and green ones. I don&#x27;t ever use the orange or yellow ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought Fran Wilson MoodMatcher Lipstick before and was happy with it and I am happy with my most recent purchase of it.  I&#x27;m glad it is available through Amazon.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter and I had fun determining how each color would change. I kept two and sent the rest back University with her to share with her dorm mates. This would make a cute Christmas stocking stuffer for teen girls.</li>
    <li> The lipsticks do last (not 12 hours on me-more like 3 or 4 hours but that&#x27;s still okay!). I found that the blue colour turned a really bright pink and it wasn&#x27;t flattering but the other colours were more flattering. The red turned my lips a rose red; I really like that colour!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN WEARING FRAN WILSON&#x27;S LIPSTICKS FOR YEARS AND ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS FROM OTHER PEOPLE HOW NICE IT LOOKS. A PERFECT GIFT TOO.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would be a longer lasting lipstick.</li>
    <li> I have used this lipstick for years.  Most lipsticks that last a long time are so drying.  This is not.  The colors run from pink to magenta (I tone down the darker colors with a frosted gloss).  The colors would probably be most flattering to those who look best in cool tones.  If you wear brown lipstick, I would say these are not for you.&lt;br /&gt;The pink turns to a bit darker pink shade; the orange turns to a coral; the yellow turns to a deeper pink; the green to an even deeper pink; the light blue even deeper; and the dark blue is almost a magenta.  At least that is what they do on me.  I am fair and blond.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the lipstick, wait a few seconds, blot, then reapply.  It is almost like a lip stain.  After it has dried on the lips, it will not come off on a glass or cup, yet somehow it stays moist.  I don&#x27;t know how they do it, I just hope they keep on doing it.</li>
    <li> I have used these lipsticks for years and they are the best I have found for stayability.  I&#x27;ve tried many recommended lipsticks and none stay on the way the Fran Wilson ones do.  Why pay more for something that is not nearly as good?</li>
    <li> Wow, 12 hours is no joke. They could probably get away with saying 15 hours. Eat, drink, kiss, try to scrub it off with makeup remover, nothing gets rid of the vibrant color. Speaking of vibrant color, they may match your mood, but only if your mood is bold and bright. It took me a week trying one every day (and looking like a clown for most of them) to figure out that there wasn&#x27;t a mellow color in the pack. If you want bright, bold, and ever lasting, go for it.</li>
    <li> Colors really appear different from each other when used. I think buying one would have been a much smarter idea. I didnt realize I could buy mood lipsticks at my local sally beauty shop and now that I know, I think these fran wilson ones are overpriced.</li>
    <li> all the colors turn pink and don&#x27;t stay on any longer than my other brands. seem like a gimic to me.</li>
    <li> Best lipstick!  Stays on.  Been wearing it for years.</li>
    <li> Fun for the kids.  Crazy color for adults.</li>
    <li> I love these lipsticks, they are moisturizing, they last all day, I have used this brand for years and I hope they stay around forever... :)</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive these lipsticks as I had used Fran Wilson shea butter lipsticks from QVC years ago and loved them. Those were actual colors and didn&#x27;t turn once applied like these do. No comparison to the shea butter formula lipsticks. When you apply the Moodmatcher lipsticks the color they turn is really  fake looking, almost like the ones in make-up kits for children to play with or I hate to say it Halloween-ish. Also, unlike the shea butter lipsticks, these made my lips burn a bit. So, I admit to having a little fun trying all the colors to see what color each one turned once applied, but I do regret buying them. I wish I had just purchased one great lipstick that I could wear all the time. I really don&#x27;t wear any of these now that the initial novelty has worn off. Not a good purchase. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for an adult - maybe a teenager would have fun with them.</li>
    <li> Love it, last for hours!</li>
    <li> Love them, because of their lasting power</li>
    <li> Hello my request I received a damaged nor suitable for use never</li>
    <li> Most of the colors turn my lips the same color/hue when applied.  Not enough contrast between the various lipsticks, but I like the color and the feel of this product.</li>
    <li> The only lipstick I have found that lasts for hours. Tried others but always disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have always loved fran wilson. It stays on my lips for hours. I have noticed that i never had chapped lips any more since i started wearing fran wilson. Not only does it color my lips but it moisturizes as well</li>
    <li> many years ago in the 80&#x27;s I believe it was I introduced my mother to the MoodMatchers. She enjoyed them till they stopped being sold locally.  About 10 years ago I found these being sold at the company I worked for so on a whim I bought mom a set and gave them to her for Christmas.  She was so excited and loved that I found them again. Of course things change and my company no longer sells them so I found them here on Amazon.  Mom is once again Happily wearing her MoodMatchers Lips daily!  I have always found that the MoodMatchers were a great lip stain to some extent.  I will use them as a base coat to lip glosses and find that what ever lip color I pair them up with stays on longer.</li>
    <li> Great lipstick for those gals who do not have the time to reapply color all the time.  Long lasting!  :)</li>
    <li> these are awesome!! like im a white person but i play beach volleyball and am really tan and no lipstick has really looked right on me but these are just perfect!! and cheap!</li>
    <li> Excellent lipsticks - they&#x27;re very longlasting.    Moodmatchers are the only lipssticks I have bought in many years.</li>
    <li> Love the look and feel, but wish it lasted longer. Still worth buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not loving the colors but I will say that they do stay on and are moisturizing.</li>
    <li> It left uneven stains on my lips. Not only that, but the color couldn&#x27;t be removed by multiple make up wipes. I also noticed it left my lips tingly and itchy after leaving it on for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. It goes on smooth and turns into a very nice color that is colorful but not too bright. It does have good staying power, however it is pretty drying for me even though I apply a lip balm before the lipstick. That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using moodmatcher for years as a base for my lipstick. Can&#x27;t live without it.  Keeps a long lasting underlying color on your lips even when your lipstick has worn off. Also allows more creativity with color blending.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a long time now. It stains so it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on glasses or anything. I get compliments all the time. I like my lips to feel moist and I can reapply it if they feel dry but the color stays the same. It is nice that it changes with a person&#x27;s skin color.  This set actually has more colors. The classic set has green, yellow, orange, and blue. Will continue to use these. The service was fast and easy. Thanks Patti</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these mood lipsticks. Haven&#x27;t seen them in over 20 years, shared this six pack with my 2 daughters and now we are all mood lipstick fans. The color stays all day and doesn&#x27;t run.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I purchased for the staying power - use as a base for my regular lipsticks who lose their color quickly.  The various colors all end up looking bright pink on me, but I don&#x27;t wear these alone, though you can.  Made of quality ingredients.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Really fun. Each lipstick is basically a different shade of bright pink. I ended up only regularly wearing one (the orange) because it was least intense.</li>
    <li> I like all of the colors.  Doesn&#x27;t stay on all day, but longer than some other brands</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new lipstick! I purchased it on a whim when I was tired of the same shades in all the stores. Recently, I was just using a tinted organic lip gloss or a vitamin E stick.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I just would not go back. It has become part of my routine to match the color of my lipstick to my outfit. You would be amazed how great the Blue looks with a pair of Blue Jeans! It keeps the undertone of the original color, therefore, making your lips match! :) I was totally amazed how much I liked the pink colors of these lipsticks. I personally only used dark or red in the past. However, now, I find that the pinks match my skin tone and outfits better. :)&lt;br /&gt;You will never find a more personalized lipstick!</li>
    <li> My mom gave my sisters and I a similar set of changing lipsticks many years ago, and these are just as fun. You can&#x27;t always know what color they will be when putting them on, but none of the shades are too outrageous. Came really fast.</li>
    <li> I had some of these many years ago, and loved them. Now that I&#x27;ve found them again, it&#x27;s wonderful to have color that actually LASTS on my lips. As other reviewers have said, they do all come out some shade of pink,and I do wish there could be something darker, but pink is ok. I tried them all on the back of my hand so I would know which ones come out which shade of pink (darker, lighter, a little more on the coral side, etc.)</li>
    <li> I thought \\&quot;moodmatcher\\&quot; was part of the name, not that these lipsticks were like mood rings.  The light blue, the main reason I bought this turned bright pink. when my husband came home he asked what was wrong.  I told him pucker up, and his lips turned the same color as mine, so not sure if it is really mood based. I&#x27;ll put them to use so way, just not for what they were purchased for.</li>
    <li> The colors of these lipstick all came out really strong on me and all are pretty much variations on bright pink. I cannot wear them because of the intensity of the color. That being said, the color did last a really long time.</li>
    <li> fun lipstick - some colors work better for me (a winter) than others - the pink, light green, and light blue are best for me - I like the way it goes on in that it gives a natural look and is not garish for someone with aging skin - the only reason for 4 stars is that I wish I could buy only one or two for a similar reasonable price</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t not waste your money, those lipsticks are terrible</li>
    <li> I wear these under lipstick sometimes, because when the lipstick wears off, this is still on.  Or I wear them by themselves.  I really like the colors that they end up becoming. The price is also great.  You get all of these for the same price that you would spend on one expensive lipstick. I don&#x27;t know why they have not become popular enough to be in department stores. Probably because they wouldn&#x27;t sell their other expensive lines of lipstick.</li>
    <li> My favorite lipsticks!  I first found Fran Wilson lipsticks in 1992 and was quickly enamored of them.  Then, I moved and could not find them in local retail stores for more than 20 years.  I was delighted to find them on Amazon.com and will not be without them again.  The strange colors in the tube turn into something that flatters my coloring and the color wears for hours without rubbing off on everything my lips touch.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.</li>
    <li> Nice lipsticks!  Arrived on time!!!</li>
    <li> My wife has found this lipstick stays on longer than most lipsticks.</li>
    <li> I love these lipsticks because of their staying power. Also, there is no bleeding  in fine lines around the  lips. And , the number one benefit is how soft and supple my lips feel.</li>
    <li> Exceptional product.  Love them.</li>
    <li> So disappointed in mood marcher lipsticks. I originally ordered the green off Miles Kimball site, which was wonderfully priced with low shipping cost, yet I didn&#x27;t like the hot pink color the green left. So eagerly I looked for &#x27;darker&#x27; colors to which I found sorces online and read others reviews on what tones the others left. I could only find other matcher colors on the Fran Wilson site, so I ordered the blue, purple and black, and since the shopping for these tiny lipsticks was nearly $8 across the board I ordered the yellow as well in hopes of a soft, neutral pink. The Fran Wilson site didn&#x27;t offer much friendly user options, so I was unsure when I could expect my order, but a week later it arrived. I was so excited and tried the blue first, it was hot pink! Then the black, it was hot pink! Then the purple, it was hot pink! Then for irritated giggles I tried the yellow, it was hot pink! Over these several days of trying different colors each time I became more disappointed and angry - they all come out the same color! Of course I go to the Fran Wilson website to seek information on returning these products and understandably they have limitations due to hygiene, though no return service for upset customers, such as &amp;#34;hey, sorry you&#x27;re unhappy with the product, but we stand behind it - though we understand you had to USE the product to find out that you didn&#x27;t like it we&#x27;ll offer you a refund along with the ridiculous shipping cost like every other companies consumers&amp;#34;. I was truly excited to find these lipsticks after so many years and many fond memories, but they&#x27;re nothing like I remember ... or perhaps it was because in the 80&#x27;s hot pink was the &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; to wear. Even though the lipsticks were $3 each and the shipping was $8 it&#x27;s really the principal of throwing away $20 on junk. My suggestion for future buyers - only order one, green being a great starting point and stop there. AND don&#x27;t use Fran Wilson&#x27;s website - go Miles Kimball or Amazon - You&#x27;ll still come out cheaper when all is said and done.You&#x27;ll still come out cheaper when all is said and done.</li>
    <li> Every one of them was way too dark and bright! none was subtle. wont be buying any more of these.</li>
    <li> these color change different - from the last time I got them</li>
    <li> From left to right- yellow, orange, red, blue, green, pink. Across the top- Robanda brand in green and then brown. Mood lipsticks are all based on red&lt;br /&gt;Dye. Understandably, they all turn your lips varying shades of the same bright fuschia shade. I would have to say that the pink and the Orange are probably the easiest shades to live with. They are slightly less garish than the others. The Robanda (from Sally&#x27;s Beauty) in brown is also decent. They all have a nice feel to them and are best used IMO as a stain or base under your preferred lip color.  If you are fair, these all may be difficult to wear.</li>
    <li> Love these lipsticks. I Had used them years ago and I Am very happy to have found them again!!</li>
    <li> I have used green color in this lipstick for years. I am so glad that I ordered this 6 piece set. It is so fun.</li>
    <li> Love these lipsticks.  I had some from years ago and was glad to find them again.  They last for quite a while and don&#x27;t ever look thick or gunky - very natural looking.  It&#x27;s also fun to play with the different colors.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is particularly special about these, but they&#x27;re interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember seeing a bunch of these in Hawaii, and a long time ago, my grandma was raving about them and gave me one. She used it as an adult, I used it like twice as a five-year-old. I guess I have that memory in my mind so I feel like this lipstick is for little kids, but there&#x27;s a plenty number of adults using it.</li>
    <li> my wife loved it  wears it everyday  doesnt leave home without it,  shares with her friends  sleeps with it on</li>
    <li> I really like these because the color stays for quite a while and my lips don&#x27;t get chapped, nor are they irritated.</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and with no issues I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of it. I was hoping that the different colors would come out differently on my lips but they all just come out pretty much the same. Just some shade of pink. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the pink hue it comes out as - it&#x27;s a bright pink. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t look that good on me, I was just hoping for either some more coral influence to show up or some more red to show up.</li>
    <li> For those new to this lipstick, they aren&#x27;t all distinctively different (not for me, at least). They do look great, though. Lipstick has never worked for me and I figured it was just how I am. When I heard that this matches to your body&#x27;s chemistry, I was ecstatic - and in the end it does look nice. This lipstick acts as a moisturizer, too, and after an eight hour  day has not rubbed off.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Color stays on your lips for several hours, even after you eat!</li>
