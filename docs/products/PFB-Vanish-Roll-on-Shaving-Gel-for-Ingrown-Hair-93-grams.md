      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase, though I don&#x27;t love everything about the product.  </li>
      <li>it feels smoother and looks much better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*This is more by way of information for people thinking about making a purchase.  </li>
      <li>Many products containing glycolic acid warn you to use a sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I actually love this product.  </li>
      <li>Ok, here goes.</li>

      <li>Easy to apply</li>
      <li>Works well and roll-on is easy.  </li>
      <li>Strong smell, yes, but</li>
      <li>As the product acts like a mild exfoliate gel - I say gel because that&#x27;s more of the consistency - you would want to get rid of the peeling skin somehow.</li>
      <li>No wonder it was listed so cheap.  </li>
      <li>original didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
      <li>I want to try the chromawhite kind next time to see if that one works better.</li>
      <li>I read so many positive reviews...</li>
      <li>I like this better tend skin, since I found it very drying.  </li>

      <li>I apply right after shaving and then for 3-4 days afterwards.</li>
      <li>It really works!  </li>
      <li>It works exactly as promoted.</li>
      <li>He has trued everything for his razor bumps &amp; this works on the first use.</li>
      <li>Also, when I first bought this, it would burn a bit to apply it after shaving.</li>
      <li>First, upon reading the instructions and on my face, it burned.</li>
      <li>Way better deal than buying Chapstick sized bottle at waxing salon for the same price.</li>
      <li>I have purchased at local spas and paid a lot more for this exact product.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>It also smells funny.</li>
      <li>Still trying the product out, seen some positive changes, but not enough to be sure.</li>
      <li>Worked at first in getting ingrowns to be very superficial</li>
      <li>Unsightly blemishes or even large incoming pimples start to minimize noticeably after even one use.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll let this go if the product really does what it says it does.</li>

      <li>This product line really seems to help, you can use it twice a day if needed.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping to AVOID unsightly blemishes on my face, which is what this product advertised to</li>
      <li>I primarily use this in the bikini area and I only apply it about once a week after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>stuck to using this on my face after laser hair removal, as it was highly recommended by my technician</li>
      <li>This stuff does burn a bit, but no more than any aftershave, and it works much better, and if don&#x27;t smell like a cologne factory</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin, but I never have a single bump from razor burn if i remember to use this.</li>
      <li>Love the product - only down side is the odor of the product</li>
      <li>Saw the results in two days, fast acting serum.</li>
      <li>It has a mild vinegar smell but clam down your skin heavenly.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leak, it spreads product smoothly and easily, and it&#x27;s not the least bit messy.  </li>
      <li>do.&lt;br /&gt;It also burned so much on my face that I started to wonder if it was just removing the first few layers of my skin, and that&#x27;s why the hairs came to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>did notice the bottle looks different than the main website, as well, which made me wonder if the product I received was old, or even possibly a knock off.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m now wondering if this is actually the same item, and not a knockoff;  it didn&#x27;t work very well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use this on a daily basis for the first couple weeks after getting Brazilian waxes, and it helps minimize (not completely prevent) me getting ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any negative symptoms and after two weeks of daily application I was able to squeeze the ingrown hairs out.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and shaving made me break out, and made my skin so red.</li>
      <li>It is becoming harder to find and more expensive, so get it while you can!</li>
      <li>could only use it at night, at home, as well, because it left a very noticeable white film where it was applied, that had to be washed thoroughly to remove - which also removed the product&#x27;s effectiveness (</li>
      <li>it works and once it dries the odor is barely noticeable.  </li>
      <li>Great product great company I was in desperate need for pbf due to painful ingrown hairs</li>
      <li>I mostly appreciated that it was half the price of what it costs in the salon.</li>
      <li>I mean the large sore pimples, no small introductory ones here.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item is great for after laser hair treatment and shaving. It has a mild vinegar smell but clam down your skin heavenly.</li>
    <li> Love the product - only down side is the odor of the product</li>
    <li> by by acne and razor burn!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s magical. This was a lot bigger than I expected which is awesome. Way better deal than buying Chapstick sized bottle at waxing salon for the same price.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> It works exactly as promoted. I want to try the chromawhite kind next time to see if that one works better. Yes, this product did make the skin a little darker and peely, but once you exfoliate the dead skin off, the ingrown hairs just get less and less. As the product acts like a mild exfoliate gel - I say gel because that&#x27;s more of the consistency - you would want to get rid of the peeling skin somehow. The only thing is that it stays sticky and slightly wet for 20 minutes, try not to put on anything immediately after use. You can, but I rather air the body dry before putting on clothing.</li>
    <li> It takes several applications daily over a period of a few weeks to see results, and it leaves behind a flakey residue that is not easy to scrub off.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I use to take care of razor bumps or ingrown hairs from waxing.  A great product!</li>
    <li> Left a white film...original didn&#x27;t do that. There a difference between the two differently labeled bottles. But there is also more than 2diff bottles</li>
    <li> Great product great company I was in desperate need for pbf due to painful ingrown hairs &amp; I ordered frm this company and I received my order the next day would def recommend them &amp; this product</li>
    <li> I bought PFB Vanish at the same time I bought an epilator; I&#x27;d read that one should use a product to prevent bumps/redness after epilating and had seen this product recommended.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase, though I don&#x27;t love everything about the product.  I primarily use this in the bikini area and I only apply it about once a week after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Roll-on applicator is great.  It doesn&#x27;t leak, it spreads product smoothly and easily, and it&#x27;s not the least bit messy.  You use only what you need.&lt;br /&gt;*Product is effective.  I have not had any ingrown hairs in the time I&#x27;ve been using this.  I also don&#x27;t get itchy where I&#x27;ve done hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is more by way of information for people thinking about making a purchase.  This product contains glycolic acid, which is also an ingredient (an alpha-hydroxy acid) used in facial peels.  If you experience peeling skin, the glycolic acid is probably to blame.  Many products containing glycolic acid warn you to use a sunscreen.  For me, this is not an issue because of where I&#x27;m using the product.  But if you use it on your face or legs or somewhere that&#x27;s going to get sun exposure, you will want to keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This stings a little bit when I apply it.  It contains a fair amount of isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol, and I suspect that&#x27;s to blame.&lt;br /&gt;*I don&#x27;t like the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t linger, but it&#x27;s a bit unpleasant when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I&#x27;m giving the product a high rating because I think it is very good at doing what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Saw the results in two days, fast acting serum.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Works well!</li>
    <li> I now have no problems with ingrown hairs. Before I used this product, it was a nightmare down there! This stuff works great! PFB Vanish was recommended to me by my esthetician.</li>
    <li> I put this on after every shave and I just don&#x27;t have razor burn anymore. I have very sensitive skin, and shaving made me break out, and made my skin so red. This stuff does burn a bit, but no more than any aftershave, and it works much better, and if don&#x27;t smell like a cologne factory</li>
    <li> It really works!  The 4oz bottle lasts a long time.  This is a great value for a product that works well.</li>
    <li> Works for ingrown hairs which I get a lot. Exfoliates skin to both prevent and get rid of hairs. Roll on is great. Smell isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
    <li> Best thing to prevent razor burn and cysts after shaving or waxing!</li>
    <li> Worked at first in getting ingrowns to be very superficial so they&#x27;d come out easier! But I still got ingrowns. I have brown scars from ingrowns, and applied this religiously. I was hoping for the scarring to go away, but it did not. Also, when I first bought this, it would burn a bit to apply it after shaving. My skin must have gotten used to it, because it no longer burns to apply. I wish it would work! I read so many positive reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would always exfoliate &amp; apply. It also smells funny. So beware for putting it on your armpits...</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! I&#x27;ve been using it for three years, and it has worked perfect on me. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t how everyone doesn&#x27;t know about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in the past, and could not find it. Noticed the bottle changed a little. Works just as good!</li>
    <li> Really works, no more ingrowns! Easy to apply</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. It&#x27;s amazing. In grown hairs gone! I have purchased at local spas and paid a lot more for this exact product.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Have ordered in the past and will again in the future.</li>
    <li> Not sure how well the product really works--it seems to help reduce redness, but not sure about preventing ingrowns. I mostly appreciated that it was half the price of what it costs in the salon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle product. I never get razor burn when I use this. My husband tried it for his neck where he usually will have razor burn and it cleared it up also. I have used this for 5 years and love it!</li>
    <li> No more bumps, for real!</li>
    <li> My son loved this. He has trued everything for his razor bumps &amp; this works on the first use.</li>
    <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually works!</li>
    <li> Still trying the product out, seen some positive changes, but not enough to be sure.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING. I have suffered from ingrown hairs for as long as I can remember and have scars from trying to remove imbedded hair. I have tried exfoliating and Tend Skin to no avail. I didn&#x27;t have any negative symptoms and after two weeks of daily application I was able to squeeze the ingrown hairs out. Such a miracle product for my skin type! I didn&#x27;t have any razor bumps as well.</li>
    <li> I actually love this product.  Was totally disappointed to see that the seller, Skin Beauty Solutions, would sell this with only two months left until the product expiration date!  One bottle of this would normally last me almost a year.  I&#x27;m guessing the effectiveness will go downhill in approx. 60 days instead.  No wonder it was listed so cheap.  May more for value people!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand having red bumps and irritated skin.  This product line really seems to help, you can use it twice a day if needed.</li>
    <li> I like this better tend skin, since I found it very drying.  This product exfoliates more and allows the skin to release the hair,  so it can be plucked easily.</li>
    <li> Love the efficacy and ease of this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now and it an extremely well calibrated product.</li>
    <li> PFB prevents razor bumps, especially in the bikni area. I use this product every time I shave and I do not get razor burn.</li>
    <li> LOL.....I wrote the Seller regarding the problems I had with PFB, haven&#x27;t heard a word and now they send a request for feedback. Ok, here goes. First, upon reading the instructions and on my face, it burned. Well, I&#x27;ve had other products burn my skin before so I&#x27;ll let this go if the product really does what it says it does. After two uses, I woke up to really BAD break-out where I had been applying the PFB. I mean the large sore pimples, no small introductory ones here. The kicker is I tried to return the product but because of &amp;#34;dangerous goods&amp;#34; transportation, Amazon will not let PFB be transported/returned back. &amp;#34;Dangerous goods&amp;#34; should tell you everything you need to know about this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It is becoming harder to find and more expensive, so get it while you can!</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I shave our private area. I hate waxing because it causes ingrown hair. So, we shave and before I discovered this product, I used to suffer from extreme itching on the 2nd and 3rd day after shaving. This product prevents this itching. I apply right after shaving and then for 3-4 days afterwards. Then, stop, then shave again and so on. So, my husband and I keep separate bottles for each. it&#x27;s the best product for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Works great on my face......</li>
    <li> This.is.the BEST remedy for razor bumps on the market bar none.  Works great on the scalp.</li>
    <li> This is the go to miracle stuff to get pimples and in grown hairs to literally vanish.  Unsightly blemishes or even large incoming pimples start to minimize noticeably after even one use.</li>
    <li> OBSESSED with this stuff. Say good-bye forever to ingrowns!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products ever! Even works on arms with those annoying &amp;#34;sweat pimples.&amp;#34; If you remove hair you want this.</li>
    <li> MUST HAVE FOR INGROWN HAIR SUFFERERS!!!!</li>
    <li> This actually works! I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic change especially under the arms! I&#x27;m going to purchase the one with the vanish next!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for well over a decade.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works for me.  Also great for acne.  Strong smell, yes, but it works and once it dries the odor is barely noticeable.  It&#x27;s effective and a great choice for razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I’ve had embarrassing bumps on my legs from waxing and shaving for years. this product was recommended to me by my wax specialist.&lt;br /&gt;i ordered it and it arrived promptly. i have been using is for 3 days now (2x a day) and there is a noticeable difference on my skin. it feels smoother and looks much better. i exfoliated once a day and all the bumps have fallen off. amazing product! i will continue to use it forever!</li>
    <li> I bought this from these sellers, obviously, because it was $40 cheaper.  The manufacturer&#x27;s website declares that no one on Amazon is a \\&quot;licensed reseller\\&quot; of the product, but I wrote this off as them not wanting to be undersold on their own items.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is so expensive for how much you get, it becomes overwhelming to use the way I want (say, on razor burn on the legs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stuck to using this on my face after laser hair removal, as it was highly recommended by my technician (recommended might be a bit conservative... I felt almost forced to buy this product before hand...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now wondering if this is actually the same item, and not a knockoff;  it didn&#x27;t work very well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no noticeable difference in ingrown hairs, and yes, while they did go away after 2-3 days of application, I sort of feel like they might have done that anyways.  I was really hoping to AVOID unsightly blemishes on my face, which is what this product advertised to do.&lt;br /&gt;It also burned so much on my face that I started to wonder if it was just removing the first few layers of my skin, and that&#x27;s why the hairs came to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could only use it at night, at home, as well, because it left a very noticeable white film where it was applied, that had to be washed thoroughly to remove - which also removed the product&#x27;s effectiveness (if any.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice the bottle looks different than the main website, as well, which made me wonder if the product I received was old, or even possibly a knock off.</li>
    <li> Works well and roll-on is easy.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> I use this on a daily basis for the first couple weeks after getting Brazilian waxes, and it helps minimize (not completely prevent) me getting ingrown hairs. It burns if you have any cuts or broken skin, so I just apply it more carefully if that&#x27;s the case. It does dry your skin out, and I think it can cause it to peel a little, but it does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do, so I have no complaints. I&#x27;ve used this for the past year and it&#x27;s definitely one of my must have products.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin, but I never have a single bump from razor burn if i remember to use this. I also used to get crazy ingrown hairs and it hasn&#x27;t happened once since I started using this. My boyfriend is addicted now as well and uses it on his face and neck after shaving. Also this bottle will probably last through three months of almost daily shaving. TOTALLY worth the price.</li>
    <li> IT works and gets rid of stubborn razor burn. It has a bit of an alcohol smell but it&#x27;s no big deal. It is lame that amazon is controlling how many words we can use in order to help them by reviewing products. How lame.</li>
