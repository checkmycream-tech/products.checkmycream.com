      <li>I honestly love this item.</li>
      <li>It holds SO many brushes.</li>
      <li>I just really love it.</li>
      <li>I have a plethora of makeup brushes and I was scared that all of them weren&#x27;t gonna fit, but the compartments and pockets are so spacious I can fit all 167 brushes!</li>

      <li>Although it was mainly my fault.  </li>
      <li>I currently have it hanging on the side of my makeup cart which allows quick access to all my brushes.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for and a much better price than what I found with other similar products.</li>
      <li>So clear all of this up, its not a &amp;#34;garbage&amp;#34; smell per se&#x27;.. just the smell of pleather that has been sealed and packed.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m a professional make up artist</li>
      <li>Horrible smell other wise great product I like it so far.</li>
      <li>I will definitely keep buying this if I need a new one</li>
      <li>Which is really annoying the belt holds up pretty good and keeps all your brushes in place</li>

    <li> The belt itself does not hold well around my waist, doesn&#x27;t have a good grip. Disappointed with it because all I can do is hold it -_-</li>
    <li> This broke within a few days. Very cheap material. Have to literally tie a knot now to use.</li>
    <li> I really love my BH cosmetics brush belt and all of their products, really! Great products for great prices!</li>
    <li> its a very handy brush belt, not bad at all</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s ok. It has alot of space for brushes. I don&#x27;t like the way it won&#x27;t stay on it comes unadjusted and slides down.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell other wise great product I like it so far.</li>
    <li> its good for the price. The quality is very poor.</li>

    <li> stores majority of my brushes and spatulas. Like the material. No scent. But it sometimes slides down.</li>
    <li> Good price, came fairly quick. It fits well. How ever It does have a smell. I had to let it air out for a few weeks...</li>
    <li> Impressed with the quality!</li>
    <li> Nice , had to rig the belt though</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Although it was mainly my fault.  But a heads up to others looking to buy this is only the bag.  I thought there were going to be brushes with this product and was wrong.  The bag looks awesome but not worth 11.00 in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Its useful! The belt is very lengthy and there are lots if pockets for lots of brushes. It does have a rubber plastic smell. I&lt;br /&gt;Wiped it with a damp soapy towel and it improved slightly.</li>
    <li> All I can say is it&#x27;s worth the money! Don&#x27;t hesitate, just get it! I will definitely keep buying this if I need a new one</li>
    <li> I honestly love this item. The brush set has a lot of pockets. The belt is adjustable to your waistline. Its awesome.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that i ordered a brush set not a belt. I am in no way a makeup artist. I dont know what i am going to do with this ugly thing.</li>
    <li> Was darling for teens makeup artist costume</li>
    <li> GREAT quality! Love this. Can&#x27;t wait to use it. Nice, professional look. Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It does the job but does not stay tight. I had to tie a knot in it to keep it from sliding off. Otherwise the pouch itself seems very durable.</li>
    <li> I received it very quick . The material is good . Just the belt can&#x27;t hold it tie</li>
    <li> will buy this again great brushes for MUA&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This brush belt is the bomb. It&#x27;s sturdy, fits all my brush that don&#x27;t have wide handles, the belt itself is wide enough for my big hips. I just really love it. If your a make up artist on a budget grab this!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on your body. Honestly, I&#x27;m a professional make up artist and it just kept falling off. I repeatedly kept tightening it and it didn&#x27;t stay on. I threw it out mid event.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and a much better price than what I found with other similar products.</li>
    <li> I loved my new set its perfect</li>
    <li> This brush belt looks great but when I tried putting it in it did adjust and the smell is horrible. I tried letting it air out but it still smell bad and if it bother me I would want to where it while doing a clients face. I&#x27;ll be returning it</li>
    <li> I came one here looking for a makeup brush belt and didn&#x27;t want to spend 80 bucks on the MAC on, and this is so great! Authentic BHcosmetics too! (I had my friends to compare to). It holds SO many brushes. This is definitely a must buy! The material is so durable and good quality. It has little pockets that you can put your business cards in. I have a plethora of makeup brushes and I was scared that all of them weren&#x27;t gonna fit, but the compartments and pockets are so spacious I can fit all 167 brushes! Lol. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Very good item just that I can&#x27;t close it the plastic pieces are different size and i have to tide it around my waist.</li>
    <li> The snap works put it wont tighten. Overal it was an ok purchase</li>
    <li> I love this belt!  It helps me to keep my brushes organized!</li>
    <li> I love it and will recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> It has a very strong smell of rubber and once you put your brushes inside the belt your brushes start smelling like the belt. Which is really annoying the belt holds up pretty good and keeps all your brushes in place just the smell is really annoying. If you can deal with the smell its a good purchase</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush belt. It can hold a great deal of the tools I need to use and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap. The only problem I have is that the strap doesn&#x27;t have a tightening mechanism. I can pull the belt through to make it tighter, but it doesn&#x27;t have anything to help create resistance so the belt doesn&#x27;t loosen again. I solved the issue with a binder clip, but that shouldn&#x27;t be needed.</li>
    <li> Great quality!  I didn&#x27;t order this to be used as a belt, so I can&#x27;t say if it is effective in that sense.  I use it more as a brush roll and I love it.  I currently have it hanging on the side of my makeup cart which allows quick access to all my brushes.</li>
    <li> This is my first brush belt and so far I really like it. It has lots of room. It does need to be aired out because of the fake leathery smell to it but other then that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Belt is loose. I had to tie the straps to keep it up.</li>
    <li> This was nicer than I thought. I was a bit leary because of the bad comments about the smell. The smell is just the plastic and smell of the material.  So clear all of this up, its not a &amp;#34;garbage&amp;#34; smell per se&#x27;.. just the smell of pleather that has been sealed and packed.  I wiped it with lemon cleaner and the odor went away instantly.  Nicely priced.. can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Dislike the smell but love how it feels and is.</li>
