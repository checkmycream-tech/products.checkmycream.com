      <li>read the reviews and make your own choice, maybe you&#x27;ll be luckier.</li>
      <li>My \\&quot;Wahl Deluxe Self Cut\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Kit would be nice to include a apron hair catcher, so the cut hair does not fall all over the floor.  </li>
      <li>I liked my barber</li>
      <li>I have cut my own hair on and off for 40 years.</li>
      <li>Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper &amp; Trimmer, 18 Pieces]]</li>
      <li>The zipper case is a nice feature to keep everything together and organized.  </li>
      <li>The ear tapering attachments add a nice touch as well.  </li>
      <li>I am a bit amazed at how well I like the Deluxe Self Cut</li>
      <li>This is a nice clipper.  </li>
      <li>The ergonomics and pivoting head are nice.  </li>
      <li>It look nice in the pic, while it isn&#x27;t what pic looks like at all.</li>
      <li>B001GQ3GF8 Wahl Deluxe Self Cut</li>
      <li>Either way you end up supplying your own needs.</li>
      <li>I bought this product to cut my hubby&#x27;s, my own and my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>cloth carry case is nice and roomy and everything fits with no troubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I cut my own hair, so the concept of the &amp;#34;Wahl Deluxe Self Cut</li>
      <li>Thus, if you must cut your own hair (and, for one reason or another, I reached this conclusion for myself in early 2009), the Wahl Deluxe Self Cut DIY product is excellent.</li>
      <li>Gave as a gift and was told its very easy to use and the cut looks proffessional.</li>
      <li>This is a very easy hair cutter.</li>
      <li>But the results are pretty darn good!</li>
      <li>The kit is nice and has more guides than I know what to do with.  </li>
      <li>if I have to buy this twice a year, it would still be worth not paying for Great Clips or Supercuts, and for the gas used while getting there.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The hair clipping instructions I feel are well laid out and if you are adept you should be able to benefit from them.</li>
      <li>My short haircut is now ALWAYS perfect and very stylish.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend not to buy this!</li>
      <li>Also, this unit is very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>The housing of this cordless hair-trimmer was made out of very cheap plastic painted silver to look like metal</li>
      <li>The scissors are pretty easy to use, and are quite sharp-I took a slice at my knuckles and bled for a good bit!</li>
      <li>Maybe a barber would be able to tell, but if nobody else can, who cares?</li>
      <li>The clipper runs stronger, when connected to the power transformer, as it provides more power, than the battery.    </li>
      <li>I tend to believe it when I see it, and while I couldn&#x27;t do this myself, with some help from my wife I was able to obtain a &amp;#34;Perfect&amp;#34; cut......</li>
      <li>and I have not been able to find a replacement offered for this blade assembly mount.</li>
      <li>Nice fit and well satisfied.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for men who want just a basic hair cut.  </li>
      <li>I researched all the available products so I could cut my own hair.  </li>
      <li>I was able to get it to turn on for three haircuts, and then it stopped working.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure my technique will improve in time.  </li>
      <li>I seem to have to go over and over my head to make sure I get all the hairs cut.</li>
      <li>i was expecting much more from a wahl branded product.</li>
      <li>-The accessories are mostly serviceable, but feel kinda flimsy.</li>
      <li>I allowed mine to charge about 30 hours to be sure.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t hold-up over time.  </li>
      <li>2009 was a year, as for many, of belt tightening.  </li>
      <li>because chasing a 5yr-old just seemed more feasible with that...</li>
      <li>Yes, it is indeed mostly plastic.</li>
      <li>The most convenient clipper ever- ultra light-weight, rechargeable (no tangling cord), plus an ingenious swivel head.  </li>
      <li>I have bought Harbor Freight clippers for $7 that were way better than these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments about my haircut and not one person who could tell I did it myself.</li>
      <li>so will do what I need of them though I might look at another design better suited for self clipping.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s mostly chromed plastic.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>The scissors are kind of cheap, but they do function.  </li>
      <li>Since my cut is based more on my lack of experience I shall stick to my views of the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I suggest avoiding this shaver, and if you do purchase it, make sure you don&#x27;t get a dud like I did.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The shaver is all plastic with rubber encased areas on the top and bottom of the handle.  </li>

    <li> I plugged it in to charge it when I got it. Several hours later, I flipped the switch to turn it on and nothing happened. Complete garbage. It doesn&#x27;t do anything, plugged in or unplugged.</li>
    <li> The most convenient clipper ever- ultra light-weight, rechargeable (no tangling cord), plus an ingenious swivel head.  Now you can trim the back of your head without being double jointed!</li>
    <li> I have cut my own hair since the early nineties. Its an easy cut where all I have to do is use an #7 guide and run it all over my head... front to back, back to front and side to side. I have used the electric but wanted to be safer by using a battery operated unit while in the shower stall (not wet!)  With this unit, it does a decent job... but the power is on the low side. I seem to have to go over and over my head to make sure I get all the hairs cut. It is safer, but I find I have to use it a couple days in a row to get it all even.</li>
    <li> Hair cutting machine is not working, do not cut the hair. The leaflets was calibrated, and still not cut.</li>
    <li> Having recently found myself in the ranks of the unwillingly retired I decided to try this product out to save a few bucks over the cost of a salon haircut. I watched the On-Line video and figured I could do it. I was right. It took me about 10 mins to give myself my first \\&quot;Do-It-Yourself\\&quot; haircut and it really does look pretty good. I needed a little help trimming up the back, which is something I&#x27;m sure will get better with practice, but other than that I considered my first attempt a success. In my opinion, this kit does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.        However, be advised that everything that other reviewers have said about the quality of the kit&#x27;s accessories is absolutely true. Don&#x27;t plan on using the mirror or the comb, and I&#x27;m not sure how long the storage case will last. When I went to unzip the storage case that holds the kit, the zipper tab popped in half, not a very good \\&quot;welcome to Wahl\\&quot; moment. When I went to remove the protective film from the mirror, the mirror lifted up out of it&#x27;s handle. The mirror was being held in place by three very tiny pieces of really flimsy double stick tape that had less holding power than the protective film. But it was no great loss as the mirror itself is only about 2.75\\&quot; in diameter, smaller than the display on many smart phones. And the comb, well I never realized that anyone could make a comb that cheap and flimsy. The mirror, post super gluing, went to my 5 year old grand-daughter, who was thrilled with it but would rather it had been a little bigger, and pink. The comb went into the trash. I&#x27;m holding onto the storage bag for now, we&#x27;ll see. I suppose Wahl figured a comb and a mirror should be mandatory items to include in a DIY haircut kit, especially since a mirror is needed to to do the back of your head. But I can&#x27;t help but wonder which is worse, not including them at all or throwing in items that are too cheaply made to be capable of performing their intended tasks. Either way you end up supplying your own needs. I suppose I should admit that the mirror did supply a few chuckles as I tried to visualize the events at the engineering meeting at the Chinese factory that assembled the mirror, when they were trying to figure out the best place to put the double stick tape to hold the mirror to the handle. And then there is the one little Chinese guy in the back who is thinking to himself \\&quot;That isn&#x27;t going to work\\&quot;.         But I didn&#x27;t buy the kit for the mirror or the comb or the storage bag. I bought it so I could give myself a decent haircut. And at that, it does quite well.</li>
    <li> LOL @ the reviewer who complained the mirror was blurry. As noted by another reviewer the mirror is covered in protective plastic, and once you peel this away it reveals nothing other than a normal mirror like any other you&#x27;ve ever seen.    Anyway, I purchased this product and used it a few times throughout a month before deciding to return this item. While it&#x27;s nice to not have a cord, what&#x27;s not nice is this hair clipper is far less powerful than your typical corded Wahl clipper. After having charged the cheap included rechargeable NICAD battery for a full day, this hair clipper ran out of juice while attempting to cut my hair and I even have male pattern baldness, so there&#x27;s not much hair to cut to begin with!    Even if I used this clipper when hooked up to the power supply, the clipper seemed to have about 40 percent less power than a corded model. If Wahl would make a cordless model with a lithium battery and has the same power as their corded models, I&#x27;d consider getting another cordless model but for now I&#x27;ve bought the Wahl Chrome Pro Deluxe model and it&#x27;s been way better. While going back to having a cord is a slight inconvenience, it&#x27;s well worth it for the extra power!</li>
    <li> The ergonomics and pivoting head are nice.  But when you open this up you realize what&#x27;s wrong with  US companies outsourcing all their manufacturing to China.  The quality is crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper itself is all plastic-looks-like-metal.  But it&#x27;s a very thin and light plastic.  It&#x27;s not going to last.  There is a noticeable wobble in the twisting head.  The fit and finish are just not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the accessories!  Unbelievably cheap!  The scissors, comb, and \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; are so crappy I gave them to my daughter to use with her Barbies.  The \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; is a 3\\&quot; plastic disk which is very fuzzy.  I get a clearer reflection from a car window.  Put a sandwich baggie over a glass mirror and that&#x27;ll give you an idea of the quality.  Imagine the shlockiest chinese junk you&#x27;ve seen.  This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package included two right ear tapers and no left ear tapering attachment.  Great quality control and inspection.  There are several cutting guides included, but they are also injected molded of very cheap plastic.  The bag itself is ok -- cheapish, but ok -- but it is about 3 times as big as it needs to be to hold this stuff.  The bag and clippers must have been outsourced to two separate factories which weren&#x27;t  talking to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions mention a tapering lever -- but there is none.  It&#x27;s a carryover from another set of instructions.  Did I mention the poor quality control?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: the economics are powerful.  This clipper will pay for itself in two haircuts (assuming they ever send my my left ear taper tool).  But I would NEVER have bought this if I had held it in my hand first and seen how poorly it is made.  Don&#x27;t buy this \\&quot;kit\\&quot;.  If you&#x27;re curious just buy the clipper itself and as few guides as you can (the instructions limit you to two guides but they toss ten of these in the bag and charge you for them).  The cost of haircuts are so high that I would happily pay double this for a quality product.  Doing this on the cheap was a very bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl: if you&#x27;re listening, bring your production back home and focus on quality.  Before the word spreadsa.    Wahl: if you&#x27;re listening, bring your production back home and focus on quality.   Before the word spreads</li>
    <li> I bought this product to cut my hubby&#x27;s, my own and my son&#x27;s hair. I was looking for one that&#x27;s cordless because chasing a 5yr-old just seemed more feasible with that... Luckily, I tried it first on Hubby, because after a few minutes of use the metal that props against your skin when shaving gets very hot even for an adult! I returned it and went with a different brand that&#x27;s also cordless but has less \\&quot;useless gadgets\\&quot; even...</li>
    <li> first few minutes were excellent i really wanted to give it 5 stars. but after about 10 minutes of cutting my own hair, i heard a loud pop! instead of the normal purring of the motor, it became a loud rumble. after i turned it off, i tried turning it on again hoping its back to normal but instead nothing happened, it won&#x27;t turn on. i can&#x27;t go around with a half mohawk and half head of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i removed the attachments and the blade assembly and found there was a piece of (get this) PLASTIC that broke off! and that piece of plastic is there to hold down the metal blade spring in place! this point onward, i had to re-align the spring and blades by hand. quite a big hassle to cut hair for 2-4 minutes at a time then routinely remove the attachment and blade assembly, clean and align the spring, then start cutting again. i finally got my hair done but it took me a lot of time and frustration. i was expecting much more from a wahl branded product.</li>
    <li> I liked my barber but he had gotten very popular, and finding a time when he didn&#x27;t have a long waiting line was getting difficult. Many years ago I would cut my own hair with a razor comb, and it worked pretty well, so I thought I&#x27;d try again. In my research to see what options were available today I narrowed down my choices to this Wahl kit and the [[ASIN:B002C741MW Philips Norelco QC5170 180-Degree Hair Clipper]]. When I saw the Norelco in a store, though, I wasn&#x27;t impressed, so I ordered the Wahl kit from Amazon.     I have now done three full haircuts and a few quick trims around the ears in between. I must admit it feels a little scary when I first start out, but if I follow the instructions it works just fine. I limit myself to the three largest guide combs. The rest cut too short for my tastes. I then finish up around the edges with no guide comb and a light touch. The only real challenge is the final touches on the back of my neck. When I&#x27;m holding a hand mirror in one hand, and the trimmer in the other, with a wall mirror at my back, my trimmer hand partially blocks the view of my neck, so I feel a little like I&#x27;m flying blind.     But the results are pretty darn good! Maybe not quite professional quality, but close enough for most purposes. However, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d want to use this the day before a critical job interview. I find I discover one or two minor mistakes which I correct with scissors over the next day or two. The whole process takes me about 40 minutes from setup through cleanup.     Pros:  -The trimmer itself is solidly built and should last a good while.  -The instructions are easy to follow.  -The rotating head and bent handle make it easy to cut all the way around. However, I use only two of the four positions. The other two don&#x27;t provide workable cutting angles for me.  -The charger/power cord plugs into the trimmer with a solid CLICK and feels secure.   -The trimmer works perfectly plugged into A/C power after the battery drains. I prefer to drain the ni-cad battery all the way to avoid memory effects. It usually runs out during interim ear trimming so I use it on A/C then. I can then give it a full charge before the next full haircut.  -With a light touch the trimmer also works great as a mustache trimmer.  -The scissors feel pretty lightweight, but they work equally well right or left handed.    Cons:  -The accessories are mostly serviceable, but feel kinda flimsy. The zipper on the case feels like it could fail at any time.   -The mirror isn&#x27;t large enough to focus both eyes on it at the same time when cutting hair. It is useful, however, in a toolbox for looking behind things you can&#x27;t otherwise see, such as behind the TV or under the sink. But for cutting hair you need a hand mirror at least 6\\&quot; in diameter plus a fixed mirror.   -The instructions show this trimmer in the photos, but the text obviously refers to models that have different features.  -When the battery needs replacing, as it eventually will, the instructions ask you to remove the battery and take it to a recycling center. After that you&#x27;re supposed to mail the trimmer to a Wahl service center to have a new battery installed. What? If I can remove the battery, why can&#x27;t I replace it myself? If only Wahl can replace the battery, why can&#x27;t Wahl handle the recycling? Dumb!    Overall, Wahl has a good product. However, because the kit has some weak points, they left the door open for a competitor to do it a little better.</li>
    <li> There are few endeavors in life more fraught with open and obvious peril than cutting your own hair.  However, while the chances of failure are quite high, the stakes remain relatively low (for comparison, consider the enterprises of sky diving or adultery).  Thus, if you must cut your own hair (and, for one reason or another, I reached this conclusion for myself in early 2009), the Wahl Deluxe Self Cut DIY product is excellent.</li>
    <li> The new clippers out of the box were not capable of cut my hair in any sort of efficient manner, they&#x27;re super loud, the head fell off 3 or 4 times while I was using it the first time, the mirror they included was a piece of plastic film which doesn&#x27;t allow you to see hair in any detail, and the scissors were made for someone in middle school. 30 minutes to give myself a 10 minute haircut. I would return if I hadn&#x27;t already used it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in February 2011, and it stopped working on August 9th 2011.  I leaved it plugged in when i shave, and don&#x27;t utilize the \\&quot;cordless\\&quot; function.  I used it eleven times, and saved myself $165 in total haircut costs over the life of the device, minus the $35 for the clipper itself, so I would say I got my money worth.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another model, but not this one. I popped off the backings of the handle and the screws were machined in so tight into the plastic that I couldn&#x27;t get them out.  The quality isn&#x27;t quite there, even though it functions properly (until it breaks, of course).  This was my first shaver, and I am quite satisfied with the 7 months use, although I would have liked to use it longer.  I figured if I&#x27;m going to spend $10 to ship this back to the manufacturer to replace the battery, I might as well buy a new shaver for $25.</li>
    <li> The product was supposed to be NEW when I placed the order.  However the one we got looks like an used product to us.  We fund some gel in between of the main cutting kit and the mirror was so dirty.  The cutting combs&#x27; sizes did not match what the description says.  It was supposed to be a gift for my husband on his birthday, but when we opened it, the gel and used looks turned us down.  I am not very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am a woman with a short, cute, pixie hair cut.  Using the self-clippers were extremely easy to trim down the back of my hair, which was a biggest concern.  I should have used scissors for the sides of hair, but overall I will save $100 every six weeks from going to the hair dresser.  Yes, haircuts start at $100 at my salon, and my stylist is great, but is nice to have that money go in my pocket, and it saves me time.  Win-win situation with the clippers!  I recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used the same clipper for 1.5 years and then it broke. Having liked the product, I decied to buy again the same model, this time from amazon. The clipper arrived on time, though it did not cut hair at all. I guess the blade was not sharpened or some problem with alignment or parts within the clipper. The blade was moving and it would look that clipper is working, but it did not cut any hair. I was busy and did not initiate product return for a month, and then found that the window for returning the product is closed.  I think that Wahl may have discontinued this product, and this clipper is just old inventory or refurbished because I could not find this on the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> Easy to use once you get used to the technique-pays for itself-great service!-they could have eliminated the mirror &amp; scissors</li>
    <li> I am a woman who likes to keep my hair short.  I dress well, my makeup is always perfect, but my hair was always a challlenge.  There is about a two week window where it looks great and then there is the rest of the time.  I got tired of needing a trim and paying the same amount for a trim as a cut.  My hair was usually too long or too short.  I found this set and now my hair looks the same all of the time with just a few minutes to do a bi-weekly touch up.  It paid for itself after one use. Not only does it save me money, but I no longer waste my very valuable time going back and forth to get my hair trimmed, waiting around, etc.  My short haircut is now ALWAYS perfect and very stylish.</li>
    <li> Looks easier to use compared to the corded, straight handle clipper that I&#x27;ve been using to cut my own hair.  I have not cut with it yet.  It could be improved if there is a battery charging light and a full/low indicator.  Right now I have to plan ahead to get it charged over night to avoid battery running dry in the middle of a cut.  An alternative improvement is to allow me to put in a AA batteries.  Wahl has trimmers like that.</li>
    <li> cheap cheap cheap, the mirror that came with is some sort of paper shiny thing. Don&#x27;t include complete junk with your product please. I was so turned off by it I have note used it yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far, so anything here-out is pretty much a freebie cut.    This thing is great.  It makes a nice cut even for someone with hair a few inches long who parts his hair one way or the other.  This was a big concern of mine before buying -- it&#x27;s not like I was just going to pick the shortest and cut it all off.    I&#x27;d give it a five-star, but I don&#x27;t like that I can&#x27;t replace the battery or at the very least use the electric cord to power it when the battery goes dead.</li>
    <li> I researched all the available products so I could cut my own hair.  A lot of them expecteded you to buzz off all your hair.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for that.  When I used this product, I made (1) little mistake above my right ear.  Not a real big deal.  Doing the back can be tricky with the mirror.  A little practice and learning from your mistakes (hair does grow back so you can try again).  I even got some compliments from my often critical friends at work.  Bottom line is, you want to \\&quot;do it yourself\\&quot; this model will do the job.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001GQ3GF8 Wahl Deluxe Self Cut Do It Yourself Haircut Kit, 18 Pieces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT A SERIOUS HAIR CUTTER!!!!! SLIGHT 5 MINUTE TRIM MAYBE, LOW POWER AND TIME ON THE CORDLESS MODEL.......  WASTE OF MONEY!  Buy the corded model Wahl makes a great piece of equipment.  Unfortunately this is not not one of them.  Do yourself a favor and skip this model!!!!</li>
    <li> I already have a Wahl clipper for home but I am an OTR truck driver and wanted something I could use on the road.  This clipper worked exactly twice and even then not very well. I would not spend the money on this one again.  [[ASIN:B000I1S18Y Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper &amp; Trimmer, 18 Pieces]]</li>
    <li> If you want short hair, this is a no-brainer! I gave it four stars instead of five in a nod to the guy who said it&#x27;s poorly made. Yes, it is indeed mostly plastic. But what isn&#x27;t these days? The cutting assembly is metal and it works great. As long as you&#x27;re careful not to drop it on the floor it should be fine.     I had to laugh about his complaint about the mirror: \\&quot;Put a sandwich baggie over a glass mirror and that&#x27;ll give you an idea of the quality.\\&quot; That sounded fishy. When I got mine I looked closely and--sure enough--the mirror was covered with a piece of protective plastic that he apparently missed. I pealed it off and it was clear as any mirror can be. Still, it&#x27;s too small to be of much use.    Anyway, I blew off his review and bought mine because I identified with \\&quot;Do it yourself &amp; save a bundle.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve always hated going to the barber and could never get them to cut it as short as I wanted. I bought this kit, tried it out on my 17 year old son with good results (luckily, or he&#x27;d have killed me!), and then started shearing away on myself.     I&#x27;ve had many compliments about my haircut and not one person who could tell I did it myself. Maybe a barber would be able to tell, but if nobody else can, who cares? Touch it up every couple of weeks and I&#x27;m good to go. I&#x27;ve saved the purchase price with just the first haircut on my son and myself. I love it and I&#x27;m laughing all the way to the bank!</li>
    <li> I had been putting off my haircut for far too long, and I started thinking about doing it myself. After watching many Youtube videos and other how-to&#x27;s, I decided to go for it. This kit includes everything you should need to cut your own hair-clippers with a number of guards, scissors, and a small handheld mirror-just read the product description. I found that everything was mostly as expected, and lived up to my expectations. The clippers seem to be of fair quality-just don&#x27;t be too forceful when you take the guards off. I accidentally took the blades right off, but it just snapped back in. I found that I didn&#x27;t need the taper-guards, nor did I really need the rotating head or angled clippers. I think a regular set would have been just as good. The scissors are pretty easy to use, and are quite sharp-I took a slice at my knuckles and bled for a good bit! It takes some getting used to, but I hope to be giving myself better haircuts in the future! The mirror was a little small but worked fine. All in all, this is a great kit for the price.</li>
    <li> I have had two of these, and both broke.  1 broke on the first use.  The quality is really terrible on these.  I love the concept since I cut my own hair, but I am bummed the quality sucks.  I spent the extra money and bought the Andis Envy.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product nor would I ever buy anything from this vendor again. The item arrived promptly but was obviously used before and roughly repackaged, missing one part, and then sent to me. Also, the razor is cheaply made and the quality is poor. Do not waste your money on this vendor or product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a decent set of clippers.  I made a bad choice when I bought these.  After less than a year and maybe 10 haircuts, they quit working.  Some small piece of the blade mechanism broke.  I contacted Wahl and had to send the clippers in.  They sent me a different set of clippers.  Now, about 4 months and 3 haircuts later, the second pair broke too (same problem).  I have very thin hair on top, I keep my hair fairly short and what hair I do have is thin and soft.  It&#x27;s not like I was trimming steel wool.  Basically, the clippers are very low quality and are now in the trash can.  I&#x27;m done with Wahl.</li>
    <li> All included stuffs work great, expect for the mirror. The mirror is not functional at all because I can&#x27;t even see my face clearly in the mirror. So I rate 4 instead of 5.</li>
    <li> We were challenged when we received this product. We could not get it to charge and trun one. So one day when we had people over we had everyone try to help us. We did eventually have someone figure it out but it was a challenge. It does work well now that we know how to turn it one!</li>
    <li> 2009 was a year, as for many, of belt tightening.  Two adjustments of note I personally made were those concerning cable TV and haircuts.  The first I took care of by canceling cable service and surprisingly I really don&#x27;t miss it.  The second, which brings me here, was deciding to cut my own hair.  After some research online I settled on the Wahl Self Cut Kit.  Overall I feel it was a good decision, but with a few issues I would be remiss in not mentioning.    The shaver works very well.  The head rotates and can be locked in position allowing it too be used with either hand.  This is good as it makes it easy to cut all areas of your head with relative ease.  Eight combs of varying lengths are included along with 2 angled combs for cutting around the ears.  The shaver can also be used without the combs for sideburns and shaving the neck below the back hairline.  The Wahl Self Cut works extremely well for a simple cut such as mine (#4 comb, ear combs, and bare shaving) and I have saved good money by using it.  I can get 2 complete haircuts with a full charge, but the razor can also be used with the cord if it becomes necessary.    Along with the pros, however, there are a couple of cons.  The shaver is all plastic with rubber encased areas on the top and bottom of the handle.  All parts seem to fit very well and it feels solid, but the quality of the plastic used is a little troubling to me.  I believe if it was dropped on a hard surface (bathroom tile for example) it could possibly shatter.  More importantly I am disappointed in Wahl&#x27;s decision to use a Ni-Cad battery instead of Ni-MH.  I find it nearly inexcusable in 2008 (year of manufacture) to be using such an outdated technology in this new product.  Ni-cads take many hours to charge and cannot be left plugged to the charger when fully charged.  It also prevents the ability to \\&quot;top off\\&quot; the charge just before use, as Ni-cads are prone to developing a \\&quot;memory\\&quot; and can permanently lose their ability to hold a full charge if you plug it in before it is depleted.  Finally, the deluxe kit is filled with accessories that are too small to be useful (mirror) or just plain useless (comb) to add any real value.  The leatherette bag is the only accessory I find to be a good addition.    All in all I can recommend the Wahl Self Cut Kit for those who, like me, are sporting a short and simple cut.  I cannot dismiss the convenience and affordability of having a haircut whenever I want or need.  Even with its shortcomings I feel it is a good buy and can pay for itself very quickly, as long as I don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
    <li> This is my third set of this clipper. So why do I keep buying it? I have cut my own hair on and off for 40 years. My hair is pretty thick, straight and coarse (Asian) and I cut it about every 3-4 weeks. I think the design is excellent for the do-it your-selfer (rotating angled head) that can do a fine job on the back of your head (I like it better than the Norelco, which I have too).  I use a 3 panel mirror in my bathroom and angle the two outer panels inward so you can see your profile when doing the back of your head. I clean and lubricate the clipper after every use. The problem with this clipper is the internal blade assembly is plastic and eventually the little plastic tab that secures the moveable blade to the vibrating pin (causes the blade to move back and forth) will snap or partially break, causing the blade to not able to fully cut, if at all (you&#x27;ll know by the hair pulling or it just won&#x27;t cut). I have looked far and wide, including on the Wahl website and I have not been able to find a replacement offered for this blade assembly mount. My guess is that for a $23 haircut set (offered presently), it isn&#x27;t worth offering by the company. The way I see it, if I can get 10 plus haircuts out of it, that is more than fair enough since the price of the entire set is about the cost of 1 haircut. So now I am accumulating a bag of all the accessories and chargers since I only need the clippers!</li>
    <li> I used this item one time and now it does not recharge. The light comes on like it is charging but when you turn the power on the motor does not work. Also, this unit is very cheaply made. It is not like the other quality items that Wahl sells. I have other Wahl products that work very well but I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking when they made this one. SMH</li>
    <li> This is a very bad quality product.The worst thing is that it makes a loud noise. I strongly recommend not to buy this!</li>
    <li> Works great with the swivel so the cutter moves with the direction of your hand. Very satisfying for self cuts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product is one of those cases where you don&#x27;t get what you pay for, even when what you paid wasn&#x27;t all that much.  I purchased this as an experiment to see if I could save myself the regular price of haircuts... around here, that&#x27;s ~$20.00/visit, counting gas into the equation.  I figured at ~$40.00, this would pay itself back after two haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the product, I noted that the trimmer casing felt unusually light for it&#x27;s size.  As such, I resolved to be extra careful with the unit while using it.  Despite that care, this product didn&#x27;t even last one haircut.  While attempting to remove the first guide comb (using the provided thumb tab at the back of the comb to do so) to swap to another, the guide comb in question removed the cutting head, permanently damaging the connection between the motor and the cutting head in the process.  The cutting head will no longer function properly as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been my first purchase of a Wahl product.  It is also my last.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who is in college. He likes to keep his hair trimmed close, and I thought this would be great for him. He informed me that when he first used it, the battery would not hold a charge, but at least it worked when he plugged it in. After using it for a few weeks, even the electric plug in won&#x27;t work, and it is past the time Amazon will allow it to be returned. I suggest avoiding this shaver, and if you do purchase it, make sure you don&#x27;t get a dud like I did.</li>
    <li> The Wahl self cut unit does a decent job if you get a good one, although it takes some practice.  I&#x27;ve used Wahl beard trimmers for decades with little or no trouble.  These new Wahl self cut clippers are not as good as what Wahl offered years ago in the beard trimmer product line.  The first Wahl self cut that I purchased was defective out of the box.  The plastic latch for the 360 degree swivel would not lock.  Unusable.  Amazon replaced the first defective.  The second one broke after two uses.  The inside of the clipper mechanism is cheap plastic and one of the plastic pieces inside broke off and fell out, causing the clipper to stop working.  I contacted Wahl.  Wahl customer service is not prompt.  I waited over three weeks for Wahl to send me a return label by mail.  Finally they sent the return label.  I returned this second defective Wahl self cut and I&#x27;m waiting for them to send me a replacement.  I hope that they don&#x27;t try to repair it.  It&#x27;s all plastic except for the clipper blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to save myself some money on haircuts. For it&#x27;s price it does the job. The clippers work well and it comes with sizes #1/2 though #8. They also aren&#x27;t very loud compared to some other clippers out there. The rotating head on the clipper is really helpful at getting odd angles around your head which was a relief. My biggest complaints are the mirror and the scissors. Another reviewer mentioned not being able to see anything with the mirror and they&#x27;re right! There is a film on it you have to remove but the mirror is just too small to see anything. It has to be right next to your face to see the back of your head and what comes out is a fuzzy image, making it ridiculously hard to trim the back yourself. The scissors are somewhat dull, ordinary scissors you&#x27;d find at a convenience store. Overall I liked it and the special carrying case it came with. Do yourself a favor and buy a larger handheld mirror and some better scissors when you buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great kit. I like all the combs that came it I can cut my hair the way I want it</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this self cut kit. I was surprised to see the quality of contents, it is amazingly low quality product. The mirror shown in the picture is actually a toy mirror, as it is not actually a mirror, it is a sort of paper. I would never recomend this prodcut to anyone.[[ASIN:B001GQ3GF8 Wahl Deluxe Self Cut Do It Yourself Haircut Kit, 18 Pieces]]</li>
    <li> before i purchase this item, i looked at those bad reviews saying how bad the quality it has. I believe them, but i also believe those who say it is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when the product arrived, i tried it and find it is not working: you need to push the blade so that it can start until oil is spread. but it wont cut hair!! i put it on my head, very little hair comes down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i used amazon&#x27;s return service, and chose to got a new one instead of refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the new one arrived is a little different from the old one: the charger is different, and it has a small charging light near the switch while the old one does not have. i tried it on my head. i was expecting no hair come down so i put it on my hair carelessly, and suddenly a bunch of hair comes down without any noise(i mean the noise of hair being cut. hair just fall down silently. there is machine noise, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only problem of this is its machine noise is a little loud. i would suggest you put ear plug when cutting your hear, and then there will be no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;remember to charge it fully and put oil on it when you first got it. if it does not start, you may need to use something to poke the blade for the first time, and then it will be fine. also, it seems it doesnt automatically stop charging when battery is full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what i like this hair cut more than others is its design of its switching head. it is so convenient for self hair cutting. if you want to save money and want to self cut hair easily, i definitely would recommend this. if what you received does not work well, just exchange for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;finally, sorry for the grammar problem...</li>
    <li> It only works when the comb is facing right, when I switch to the other side it does not work at all. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
    <li> I love but this is my second one. The blades are partial plastic and easily broken. The ease of use is great only wish it was constructed of better materials.</li>
    <li> Whal a trusted name  so I bought it came on time but the button  you push to allow the head to rotate did not work the head rotated freely,  but the odd thing if you pushed the button while you held it the head was locked something was put together wrong. I tried for a exchange but Amazon only gives refund so took that.  decided not to re order if a simple button works in-reverse what els  could be wrong.   read the reviews and make your own choice, maybe you&#x27;ll be luckier.</li>
    <li> I received my Wahl haircut kit today, March 15, 2012.  I used it today, and it preformed remarkably well.  In about thirty minutes I had a neat, short haircut.  Not the best haircut I have every gotten, but not the worst either.  I&#x27;m sure my technique will improve in time.  The unit is not something a professional barber would buy, it obviously a light duty device, meant of occasional use, but I can foresee using it every three or four weeks with no problems.  A couple of tips, first get a good hand mirror, the one supplied with the unit is very small.  Second I ordered a number 10 guide to go with this unit, it gave the top of my head a neat look, but bare in mind that i am a truck driver and short hair is a must.  They make guides even longer, and if I were a business person I might consider a 12 or longer.  By the way I took my time and still managed to finish in less then half an hour, but read the intructions first, and oil before using.  All in all not bad for a tool that cost about the same, as the twenty dollars that I would have paid the barber.</li>
    <li> This item did not function strait out of the box. Where&#x27;s their quality control? would give it a zero star but cannot.&lt;br /&gt;I have always like WHAL items. I have a older razor , a beard grooming razor, and a cordless beard grooming razor that are all many, many years old. This thing seems to be a cheap knock off that is stealing the WHAL name, in all honesty.</li>
    <li> to ligth weigth  has no power gave away</li>
    <li> I guess you have to do 1 star. They didn&#x27;t work when I got them.  I was so disappointed that the name Wahl was even on them. This has nothing to do with the seller, but everything with the manufacturer. The are light weight. And suppose to be cord or cordless. Neither work. I&#x27;m glad it happened now instead of 2 months from now. You can just tell it is definitely a cheap made product.</li>
    <li> I have had long hair for many years but recent health has forced me to cut to something more easily managed. I decided upon this kit because of the Wahl name for one but I like the idea of the right angle handle and rotatable head. If you have never cut hair let alone your own this kit will not make you an instant barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are very well written with picture guides. Being no expert in a kit like this,to me, it appears to have everything one would need to get the desired results if you have the skill of using a clipper. Since my cut is based more on my lack of experience I shall stick to my views of the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cordless trimmer but can also be operated while plugged in. 16 hours to charge is recommended. You can also leave this clipper constantly on charge and info says it will not overcharge. I allowed mine to charge about 30 hours to be sure. The red charge indicator always remained red. I am not sure if it should change color on full charge or not though I am sure it is mentioned in instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very thing I liked about this clipper I can see will lead to a possible short life span of this product. When I first tried to turn it on nothing happened. was like it never charged. It took a lot of rotating the swivel clipper head and making sure it was locked in place. After about a dozen attempts it finally began to work. The locking system is very cheap as is the entire kit in general.I paid 20 dollars and feel indeed I got a 20 dollar clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair clipping instructions I feel are well laid out and if you are adept you should be able to benefit from them. I did not but never cutting hair let alone my own then my health affect my abilities as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloth carry case is nice and roomy and everything fits with no troubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will cut hair as is suppose to but I only give 3 stars for the cheap quality and the first start issue that I almost thought I had a dud.If you are looking for something that will get a lot of regular use I would look at something a bit better made. Mine will only be used on myself a few times a year at most I figure so will do what I need of them though I might look at another design better suited for self clipping.</li>
    <li> Stay away from it.  It would never charge or even work when plugged in.  The unot itself is very low quality, with no good grip.</li>
    <li> The quality isn&#x27;t as bad as I expected after reading a few reviews. I Love the fact that I can either have the cord as a backup (because I didnt give it enough time to charge) or go cord free and shave my head away from power. The rotating head makes grooming yourself, a breeze!     I have the Wahl Peanut as well, but it doesnt have (and cannot be fitted with) any guard larger than a 1/2\\&quot; (#4). The Peanut is also a permanent corded unit, and I quickly found out how convenient it was to not have a cord with my new Deluxe unit.     My \\&quot;Wahl Deluxe Self Cut\\&quot; (18 pc) has many guards up to 1\\&quot;. PERFECT! I need a #4 around the low sides and a #6 around the top and an #8 on the top. Quick guard changes are no problem. It also has two Ear taper guards (L &amp; R) for clean \\&quot;over the ear\\&quot; look. The razor itself, is chrome and fits in your hand well, especially with the rotating head. Left or right hand? No problem. The kit also comes with some pretty simple \\&quot;hair cutting\\&quot; instructions for quick reference.     The kit comes with a little pouch and I use it to keep all of the parts together and stick it in my bathroom drawer for quick access. A quick charge after use, then put away for a week or so for the next trim. I like to keep on top of cutting my hair so it doesn&#x27;t get out of hand, and this Wahl does the trick!    Time will tell how long it will last but it has payed for itself already in three cuts!    I LOVE my Wahl kit!</li>
    <li> This product was horrible..would not turn on at all.they sent me a new onean d that one did not work either.i recommend not to order this item.</li>
    <li> I love it. If manufacture gives one flexible mirror handle which can bend and show us exact hair cutting then it will be really good product.</li>
    <li> reading the other reviews, I expected to be disappointed, but so far I have to say it&#x27;s not bad. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times. As others have mentioned, most of the \\&quot;accessories\\&quot; (mirror (all this needs is a piece of elastic string and red ball to be useful), scissors (can you say 3rd grade?), comb (like I needed another), etc) are junk - I&#x27;ve seen better quality in Barbie stuff. The clippers work great and the whole idea of cutting my own hair was easier than I thought - except for the neckline - that&#x27;s a real chore trying to keep things straight while viewing through 2 mirrors - probably warrants some help.</li>
    <li> Purchased this on a recommendation from a friend and was not disappointed.  I live by myself and got tired of wasting money on hair cuts.  This does the job well and works quite well on my thick hair (on the sides at least, thanks genetics).  It is also fairly easy to use for a single person, just be sure to get a better mirror, the one included is junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll close with a piece of poetry I&#x27;ve always loved, lol:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Babies haven&#x27;t any hair.&lt;br /&gt;Old men&#x27;s heads are just as bare.&lt;br /&gt;Between the cradle and the grave&lt;br /&gt;Lies a haircut and a shave.&lt;br /&gt;-Anon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truer words were never spoken.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair very short, so I felt silly paying salon prices for haircuts and decided to do it myself. I borrowed a friend&#x27;s set of Wahl clippers and they worked great, but it was difficult to get the right angle with the traditional shape clippers on my own head, so when I went to buy my own, I decided to spring for the ergonomic handle. It made a very big difference and cutting my own hair was a dream. I can do it on my lunch break. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> VERY LIGHT WEIGHT AND EASY TO HANDLE. UNIQUE SHAPE TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO, BUT ONCE ADJUSTED IS A GREAT TRIMMER!</li>
    <li> PRODUCT BROKE AFTER USING ONCE.</li>
    <li> When I plug it it was not working and the seller tells me that the one month warranty was over.</li>
    <li> It cuts great but one side nicks ur skin and causes u to bleed and feels like razor burn ive only used twice</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 of these self-cut clippers. I really like the shape and movable head and have used them many times to cut my hair.  I use the number 8 guide and purchased additional guides 10 and 12.  The problem is that they stop working after about 10 cuts.  In one case the motor would not turn even with the clipping head removed.  In the other two cases the clipping head would stop working, i.e., the motor would freeze and the clippers would not move or make any sound to indicate the motor was struggling.  I assume that the clipping head somehow jams becuase I could get it to work again if I removed it and put it back on, but it would stop again shortly thereafter.  The clippers could be a great product if not so cheaply made.  As indicated above, I have continued to buy replacement clippers because of the conveinence when they are working.</li>
    <li> the worst quality ever ... actually I think it is a Wahl product !!&lt;br /&gt;Broke before I use .. did not charge .. I returned it back&lt;br /&gt;go for Philips Norelco QC5570/40 instead .. it is the best</li>
    <li> The swivel handle is a very unique feature on this clipper and very helpful for cutting your own hair.  The mirror is rather small.  There is a wonderful selection of guides.  The zipper case is a nice feature to keep everything together and organized.  The scissors are kind of cheap, but they do function.  After only about three haircuts, this kit &amp;#34;paid for itself.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 months now and it&#x27;s really good. Not only good price but good machine</li>
    <li> Seems to work ok, just cheaply built, case is junk zipper broke first time I opened it</li>
    <li> Nice fit and well satisfied. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for men who want just a basic hair cut.  The fold-out instructions could have been expanded on, but they get the job done.  I didn&#x27;t have any prior experience with cutting hair and made a few glaring mistakes at first.  But no one at work noticed and it grew back fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I have to buy this twice a year, it would still be worth not paying for Great Clips or Supercuts, and for the gas used while getting there.  Not to mention waiting in line and enduring sales pitches for over-priced hair-care products.  The clippers and various attachments are of acceptable quality, although as mentioned in other reviews there&#x27;s no telling how long they&#x27;ll hold up.  The little mirror is so useless that I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s even included; but a quick trip to the supermarket for an upgrade and a few more dollars spent, and problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me the main selling point is the clipper&#x27;s rotating head.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible to cut one&#x27;s own hair without this feature, but it sure makes maneuvering the clippers at awkward angles much easier.  The ear tapering attachments add a nice touch as well.  Surprisingly, the soft storage case is of sturdy design and easily accommodates the clippers and all accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied and am considering buying another set so as to have it on hand for if/when the clippers do break and I&#x27;m not caught with half a haircut.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying for haircuts that seem to go up in price to often. Last time I went in the price was 14 dollars. I thought this is crazy. I bought this self cut with the angle trimmer. After two haircuts this thing payed for itself. This trimmer is now saving me money.Very pleased with it, wish I had got it years ago.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl hair trimmer. There is nothing wrong with the old one, but I liked the idea of cutting my own hair with something that would give me control. This new Wahl with the ninety degree curve allows me to have a better chance of trimming my neck hair, which is a great selling point.     It is very light and easy to control, cuts really quick and clean. The pivoting head is really great...but has one heckuva flaw for me. The cutting blade-head is not adjustable (like my older model), and cuts my hair way TOO short. The smallest guide comb is the #1 (1/8th), which cuts my hair to a point where I have to trim it weekly. I have found other models at the Wahl site that include the 1/16th guide comb... why doesnt this one? Yea, its a minor gripe, but a legitimate one as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I have written to Wahl about this, and will update my review, should things change.     UPDATE: I contacted Wahl and told tham about my situation. They sold me a #.5 blade for $3.00 (delivered). I would change this to 5 stars, but I cant seem to find how to change the star rating.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and worked sometimes for a little while.Threw it in the garbage. I have thrown two wahl clippers in the trash where they belong.</li>
    <li> This is the worst Wahl Product that I have ever used in 40 years! The rechargable battery is a joke! I couldn&#x27;t even make it through a hair cut after the second recharge. I should have sent it back immediatly but I decided to give it a chance. Now, after less than 12 attempted hair trims, the only way it will work is to leave it plugged in, and it still does a crappy job. I have bought Harbor Freight clippers for $7 that were way better than these. I can&#x27;t believe Wahl accually sells these things! I am not sure if I can trust any Wahl clippeers after these! The twistable head would be great if it continued to work for moe than the amount I uuse it. I use a Flowbee to cut my hair and I bought these to trim up the edges. I lost. They are Crap, Crap, Crap!</li>
    <li> it broke after a few months, the portion of the device where you plug in your power broke and fell inside the case, I the was able to pull it out and plug the charger back in but the battery would no longer take a charge and the receptacle broke off and now it is just trash, I would advise anyone that is thinking about buying this sort of device to buy a corded one and stay away from the rechargeable one they are cheaply made and are just a waste of your money. I had bought a rechargeable before and it lasted several years before the battery went belly up, but they have gotten much cheaper and the clippers only lasted a few months</li>
    <li> Worked a very short time, then had to use cord all the time, then it just died all within 7 months.</li>
    <li> The product don´t go on, I just use it once, bat product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don´t buy it, really don´t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I tend to believe it when I see it, and while I couldn&#x27;t do this myself, with some help from my wife I was able to obtain a &amp;#34;Perfect&amp;#34; cut......and after a shampoo and shower my hair was PERFECT..........no more trips to a Stylist for me, this device has already paid for itself and I highly recommend it........Buy it, You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> My roommate ordered this hair clipper So I ordered one of the same model hair clipper for myself.&lt;br /&gt;But guess what..it didn&#x27;t even work for the first time. I charged it for 8 hrs but still it didn&#x27;t work. I returned this hair clipper back to Amazon without using it.&lt;br /&gt;Now my roommate&#x27;s hair clipper also is broken &amp; it has some alignment problems.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest Wahl to improve the quality &amp; test the device before they pack &amp; ship it. It has 2 years warranty but whats the use if it doesn&#x27;t even start for the first time. I would suggest everybody to think twice before they go for this hair clipper.</li>
    <li> Updated on Tuesday, December 9, 2014    Purchased the Wahl Self Cut clipper, back in October, of 2011, for $30.93. I deferred writing a review because I had never tried cutting my own hair previously, and had no experience on the matter.    Now with 3 years of experience, I can say the expenditure was worth it, and the Wahl Self Cut clipper has resulted in financial savings, along with recoupment of the initial investment. The major savings arises from not patronizing the local barber shop.    In tandem, with learning to use the clipper, the switch over to a shorter hair style, which appears to be in vogue, for the moment, resulted in further savings, as shorter hair consumes less shampoo, a pleasant surprise.    The rotating clipper head makes it is easy to use, especially if you are cutting your own hair.    Although, it is not mentioned, in the product literature, the clipper blade can be detached, from the rotating head, allowing cleaning, and removal of hairs, from the clipper blade, and head compartment.    The clipper runs about an hour, on battery only, when fully charged, which is about the amount of time required to maintain a Burr or Butch hair cut.    The clipper runs stronger, when connected to the power transformer, as it provides more power, than the battery.    Adherence to the maintenance instruction should result in optimum return on investment.    The clipper blades plastic platform broke, in the rear, after 3 years, rendering the blades and clipper useless, unable to find a replacement platform, irrespective of that, ROI was achieved. A higher ROI would have occurred, if the blades platform was not made of plastic, those seeking a higher ROI should not acquire this product.    It is unfortunate that the manufacturer has discontinued the Wahl Self Cut clipper.    It is still available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Head kept falling off.  It&#x27;s been on the shelf after a few attempts to use it.  Too much time has passed I guess to send it back.</li>
    <li> The device works well, but I have used it maybe 8 times in the past 2 years and the battery now does not charge.</li>
    <li> Hello, its dosent work.. Y cant turn it on , can you help me...</li>
    <li> Very noisy. Didn&#x27;t cut very well and a small piece of plastic broke off during first use.  I already returned it for credit.</li>
    <li> Arrived and the buzzer was broken</li>
    <li> Kit would be nice to include a apron hair catcher, so the cut hair does not fall all over the floor.  A little tricky to cut my own hair at first, but I suppose with time and practice, I could learn how to fully use the trimmer and guides.  The included guide is not through enough or does not cover enough various types of hair styles, it only covers the basics.  I would buy this kit again and would recommend it to anyone who is scared of the hair stylist for one reason or another.</li>
    <li> It has worked good, no problems so far.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this product to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product was what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I have ever had anything shipped so fast. It was a great easy buy.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. I opened it up, charged it and tried using it but the head would not work. Poorly made and a piece of junk. I rarely leave 1 star but this one deserves a single star for sure. Please avoid this item.</li>
    <li> has everything you need for a crew cut and trimming would say it is a good buy for the price</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and was told its very easy to use and the cut looks proffessional. Receipient was very happy</li>
    <li> Beside DOA, the zipper broke.  Red light shows it is charging.  Kept plugin for 24 hours.  Still not running.  I am returning it.  Will look  for something other than Wahl.</li>
    <li> The unit does not work after charging it.</li>
    <li> purchased for a Christmas gift, when trying to use it realized it does not work well and looked to return it and found out the return was no longer valid. Very disapointed</li>
    <li> I received this product and plugged it in to charge overnight. The next day I tried it and it did not work at all. I removed the blades and the motor ran, when I put the blades back on, it would not run. I like the design but will look for a better product.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time we&#x27;ve purchased this product over the last 4 years.  It only seems to last about a year before something goes wrong with it.  This one showed up and was humming really loudly---we used parts from the last one we bought to take it apart and fix it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice clipper.  I&#x27;ve never tried the regular ones but the shape of the handle and the pivoting head of this one is really convenient for self clipping.  I can&#x27;t really compare the quality but it&#x27;s mostly chromed plastic.  I personally don&#x27;t like chromed plastic because under all that glitter, it&#x27;s still plastic.  Simple black would be fine.  I think the instructions say the charge is good for 40 minutes.  I haven&#x27;t run it long enough to find out.  The kit is nice and has more guides than I know what to do with.  Also has a case, oil to lubricate the head, a mirror, scissors, comb and little cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair, so the concept of the &amp;#34;Wahl Deluxe Self Cut Do It Yourself Haircut Kit&amp;#34; should have been a perfect match.  However, the execution was poor.  The housing of this cordless hair-trimmer was made out of very cheap plastic painted silver to look like metal and I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t hold-up over time.  Plus, the pivoting head would not lock-in for any of the 4 pre-set positions.  Couple that with missing guide combs and opened oil, made me realize that either this unit had been returned by another customer or poorly packed at the factory.  In any event, I immediately returned the unit for a full refund and can&#x27;t recommend it for any purpose.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve left a negative review for anything purchased from Amazon.  Unfortunately, this product is, as others have stated already, complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first one arrived on Wednesday of last week, and was dead-on-arrival.  Would not turn on, even when plugged into the AC adapter.  Ok, that happens, no big deal.  I reported it to Amazon, and they promptly shipped me a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement arrived on Friday.  Anxious to try it out, I snapped on the #6 comb attachment and started cutting.  Three minutes into the process, after I&#x27;d already cut 1/4 of my hair, the sound of the device changed, and it seemed to stop cutting hair.  A small piece of black plastic fell out from somewhere inside the cutting head.  From that point forward, no matter what comb I tried or how slowly I worked, the blade simply would not cut any hair.  The blade still moves, it just doesn&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed, I returned the second unit for a refund.  I won&#x27;t be trying this one a third time.</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying $15 every time I need my haircut. This is a very easy hair cutter. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how well my hair looked. The problem though is the mirror that is included. Worst mirror ever. After purchase, get yourself another handheld mirror.</li>
    <li> I am a bit amazed at how well I like the Deluxe Self Cut Do It Yourself Haircut Kit works.  I am still working on learning how to get my hair cuts the way I like them without making too many big mistakes, but it is happening.  This will pay for itself the next time I use it, which will be the third.  I am saving SO much money, not to mention time.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a pretty straight forward hair style.  You can do it yourself, or someone can do it for you, and be done SO much faster, with SO much more money to spend on what is important.</li>
    <li> Not only is it made cheaply (chrome-colored paint over plastic), the head comes off super easily (it just pops off whenever it feels like it).  And by 3rd use, the little black plastic piece holding together all the energy vibrating from the motor snapped off.  Why oh WHY in the world would you give a tiny little flimsy plastic piece the job of anchoring the strong motor together.  I tried to crazy glue it back to no avail, so without even 4 uses, this piece of crap is utterly useless.  For the record, I have a 10 year old Wahl beard trimmer that STILL works super well.  Has the company and the quality of it&#x27;s products gone downhill?  Don&#x27;t find out the hard why by buying this piece of crap.  I&#x27;d give it zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Power cuts in and out of the device frequently, and it&#x27;s underpowered for my thicker hair.  After about the third time I used it, after struggling to get it to function, the head fell apart.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> May be it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t master the method? I dnon&#x27;t know,&lt;br /&gt;But it seemed it didn&#x27;t work with my hair, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my son who is training to be a first responder and cuts his hair short, but, the unit acts as if it has a bad battery even with a full charge. Will have to return the unit.</li>
    <li> Very cheap, worthless after first use.  Did clean and oil, still would not cut hair, Run the comb through your hair 100 times, won&#x27;t cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit a little over a year ... When it would actually turn on, I would get a good haircut. Unfortunately, the rechargable battery, or the charger doesn&#x27;t work. I was able to get it to turn on for three haircuts, and then it stopped working. Can&#x27;t recommend this product. Would probably not buy another Wahl product.</li>
    <li> This product just sucks. It look nice in the pic, while it isn&#x27;t what pic looks like at all. The mirror is even made of plastic. And I don&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this last year it not even worked at first time,carefull on buying this item it may be damage piece.</li>
    <li> Just got this thing, first thind you notice is that it&#x27;s extremely light...because its made of plastic (i wanted to open it to see if theres a motor in it but i dont want to void the waranty)&lt;br /&gt; charged it for 12 hours like the manual says and it wont turn on for nothing. This thing is going back first thing tomorrow morning</li>
    <li> Cut hair great!YOU Wont be sorry for this price. Had it a year, if it does stop working I would buy another one</li>
    <li> At first, I really liked these clippers -- the twisting head seemed like just what I needed since I often do my own haircuts.  It worked pretty well at first, but certainly not up to Wahl&#x27;s usual standards.  The blades were very noisy, and the build is cheap plastic.  And just as I thought, they died after 3 months, which probably only totaled half a dozen uses at most.  These are the worst Wahl&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever used, and if I didn&#x27;t know better, I&#x27;d think the entire brand was crap.  But this is the first set of Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve had that sucked.  I&#x27;ll give them a pass on this one, but not happy it didn&#x27;t last at all.  Still a Wahl fan, but these are terrible.  Avoid.  On the plus side -- the little brush still works.</li>
    <li> This  Clipper broke immediately after  it touched my HAIR! I was stuck with a streak of shaved hair, luckily i had old clippers to finish the job. If  i didn&#x27;t have my old clippers, I would&#x27;ve been stuck with a one streak shaved hair cut for a day until I  could go see a barber. It would&#x27;ve been a day of ridicule and embarrassment at work. don&#x27;t buy this product it was cheaply made. It&amp;#34;s obvious it wasn&#x27;t built  to last for two minutes. Save your money and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have thick or coarse hair, the motor will brake. Just don&#x27;t  buy this because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Even if you have thin hair, it may last a couple of months max, because it wasn&#x27;t built to last long at all. Wahl made a  lemon product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you&#x27;re middle eastern, Mediterranean dissent, black, or if you simply have thick hair, the motor will fail midway on your first haircut. ***if  you don&#x27;t have any extra clippers available. Make sure to use it during the day so you can run straight to the barber to fix your hair  when it brakes***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember you were warned!</li>
    <li> Sucks, won&#x27;t even run when plugged in, I have to manually push the blade every time to start it up.......and even then its 40 % of the time it will run. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I had to return it because the blades were stuck and I could not loosen them.</li>
    <li> These clippers are not ready for prime time. I need to struggle with them to get them to work when I change the head direction. I don&#x27;t recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re defective and won&#x27;t cut hair.</li>
    <li> This sets seems to have everything but it is actually very awkward to use. The pivot head it useless and causes the blade to pop off</li>
    <li> What I expected and then some. The only critical remark I have is that the hair guides which fit in the clippers fit in a loose pike in the case do they just roll around and are not organized in the case.  The case itself barely fits the items so trying to organize the hhair guides is not possible with the included case.  Product is what I need and serves it design well.</li>
