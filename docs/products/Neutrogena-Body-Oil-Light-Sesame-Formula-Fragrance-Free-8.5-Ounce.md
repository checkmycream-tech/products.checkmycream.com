### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great product  and seller  !</li>
      <li>This is the best stuff!</li>
      <li>Wife and I are using it especially more often during the winter.</li>
      <li>A very good shower oil that goes on and isn&#x27;t rinsed off afterward, so it is very effective.  </li>
      <li>Great product to add to your skin care regime.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still a very nice after shower body treatment as well.</li>
      <li>Feels good on the skin and the feel of oiliness disappears almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>Great for post sunning, if you still do that kind of thing.</li>
      <li>It is also good for massage.</li>
      <li>So I tried the Neutrogena Body Oil I had on hand, and the results were equally good.</li>
      <li>It does not smell like sesame oil at all, which is good.</li>
      <li>Nice to apply after a bath, but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing.</li>
      <li>You massage it into your face and then rinse it off with warm water.</li>
      <li>I prefer this to the nicely scented version, as aromas seem to grow stronger smelling on my skin through the day.</li>
      <li>While I find the light Sesame Formula very pleasant, my husband is highly allergic to fragrances, so being able to purchase my favorite oil again has been great!  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember how many...</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff as a moisturer post shower.</li>
      <li>And the price was about 10 times better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for so many years</li>
      <li>It actually has a very pleasant sensual smell.</li>
      <li>It has a very, very light scent which is fine</li>
      <li>It feels good, but has a very unpleasent smell.</li>
      <li>It is easier to apply, doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, and my liner does not develop an odor and slides on easily.  </li>
      <li>This item makes my skin smooth and silky after a shower.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, never feels greasy, and absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
      <li>Very quick delivery and exactly as described</li>
      <li>I loved the very clean and soft results, but the little bottle of oil would have been over forty dollars.</li>
      <li>The only version available at the drug store was Light Sesame.</li>
      <li>leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>then I can put on my perfume and not smell funny.</li>
      <li>I love this product and will keep using it as long as I can.</li>
      <li>It helps you to stay a little bit warm.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying the fragrance free version of this Neutrogena oil for years at my local drug store (Longs).  </li>
      <li>However, shortly after CVS bought them out, they stopped carrying the fragrance free formula.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for someone that has a prosthetic arm or leg.</li>
      <li>The only helps keep my skin moist, and is absolutely scentless.</li>
      <li>Follow that by washing with a gentle face soap and blot dry.</li>

    <li> great product  and seller  !</li>
    <li> It does not smell like sesame oil at all, which is good. Not like the smell of food. It actually has a very pleasant sensual smell. Oil is not too thick. Nice to apply after a bath, but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing. Feels good on the skin and the feel of oiliness disappears almost immediately.  Wife and I are using it especially more often during the winter. It helps you to stay a little bit warm. Helps your skin to keep it from drying. It is also good for massage.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff! I&#x27;ve used it for so many years I can&#x27;t remember how many... I put it on after a shower and it dissolves into my skin. (I hate putting on cold lotion after a shower!) I have super-sensitive skin, allergic to a million things, and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the fragrance free version of this Neutrogena oil for years at my local drug store (Longs).  However, shortly after CVS bought them out, they stopped carrying the fragrance free formula. Other stores and drug stores also seemed to be pulling it from their shelves.  While I find the light Sesame Formula very pleasant, my husband is highly allergic to fragrances, so being able to purchase my favorite oil again has been great!  It&#x27;s light, never feels greasy, and absorbs into the skin quickly.  I often sprinkle it into the tub instead of using bubble bath!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil on recommendation of my massage therapist. The only version available at the drug store was Light Sesame. It feels good, but has a very unpleasent smell. I took another shower to get it off and threw the bottle awaay.</li>
    <li> Rub it in after shower before drying. Keeps my skin moist, countering dryness caused by aging. Rub it on toenails, keeps fungus in check.</li>
    <li> A very good shower oil that goes on and isn&#x27;t rinsed off afterward, so it is very effective.  Not so thick as to be a problem.  I prefer this to the nicely scented version, as aromas seem to grow stronger smelling on my skin through the day.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of a very expensive oil treatment for the face in the mail. You massage it into your face and then rinse it off with warm water.

So I tried the Neutrogena Body Oil I had on hand, and the results were equally good. And the price was about 10 times better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a very nice after shower body treatment as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is a fanastic product.  I have been using this for over ten years. I put it on my skin while it is still damp from the shower and it sinks in immediately.  It helps moisturize my skin during the harsh winter months, my legs tend to get very dry, itchy, and flaky and this product helps relieve this. It does not leave an oily residue like other oil based products do. It has a very, very light scent which is fine then I can put on my perfume and not smell funny. I love this product and will keep using it as long as I can.</li>
    <li> leaves skin smooth and soft. bit pricey. but works and no perfume smell to irritate skin. I apply after getting out of shower on wet skin.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin this product will soften your skin immediately and only a little is needed!  A part of my shower routine and my boyfriend&#x27;s...</li>
    <li> Based on a well know Ancient Indian treatment,it is widely used in India daily,even for cooking.The Indian version is thick and after letting it soak you have to wash it off,Whereas NEUTROGENA is lighter and not so OILY.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery and exactly as described</li>
    <li> I love this stuff as a moisturer post shower. A few drops on your hands, rub on while you are still wet and pat dry. Great for post sunning, if you still do that kind of thing. Like the unscented.</li>
    <li> Great..no fragrance as stated. Due to my husband&#x27;s migraine headaches I have to be careful of any type of fragrance that might set off a headache..</li>
    <li> My skin is a little drier than it used to be, and I don&#x27;t like using lotions every day. The only helps keep my skin moist, and is absolutely scentless.</li>
    <li> This item makes my skin smooth and silky after a shower.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Was a little sad that I didn&#x27;t get the one with fragrance, but this was really nice.</li>
    <li> This is my secret weapon for having maintaining young skin!</li>
    <li> I use this under my liner for my prosthetic leg.  It is easier to apply, doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, and my liner does not develop an odor and slides on easily.  I highly recommend it for someone that has a prosthetic arm or leg.</li>
    <li> Great product to add to your skin care regime.</li>
