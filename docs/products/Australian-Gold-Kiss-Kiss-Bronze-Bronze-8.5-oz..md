    <li> much cheaper than buying from the tanning salon&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice moisturing lotion  and has  great smell. It gives a slight tint to your skin. I have been told it makes you look radiant.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Doesn&#x27;t make u spotty, it didn&#x27;t make me burn.... It does what it is suppose to do very well!!!!</li>
    <li> We are VERY HAPPY with the NEW tanning lotion. For years my wife has used the accellerator. This is MUCH BETTER !!  When shes HAPPY ....I&#x27;m HAPPY ! and she looks GREAT TOO !! THANX !!</li>
    <li> Bought this because I was in need of a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; lotion till my good stuff came in. Didn&#x27;t do much, but I&#x27;m an experienced tanner and have some good color. Would def keep around as a backup. And as for the scent, what a bummer! Extremely light coconut/tropical. Normally ag is known for their delicious smells! Better than a bad smell I suppose.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very satisfying and does a nice job for my skin type.  It also smells nice.</li>
    <li> The product itself was just simply okay, wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell either, it had that nasty after tan smell than i hate so much, it is pretty inexpensive however so i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results of this tanning lotion. And the price is fantastic. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I know I should be wearing a lotion with SPF (this has none) but this has an accelerator and bronzer.  After I&#x27;ve got a base tan, I start using this.  I don&#x27;t  want to wear it any earlier, as I think I would get a sunburn with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes me look 10x tanner than I would normally be.  That means, I tan way faster and can spend  less time in the sun if I want.  The older I get, the less I can tolerate the heat.  LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it evens out my tan.  I don&#x27;t tan the same all over but with this lotion, I do.  It&#x27;s the bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used or retailed to my clients! It&#x27;s a must use. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!!!</li>
    <li> 5 stars i love this indoor tanning lotion.. it works great no streaks great price. i use in indoor and outdoor actually and still get that golden tan i want. no yellowish orange colors  def would recommend packaging great and everything!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this tanning lotion! I had bought it before from the tanning salon I used to go to (it&#x27;s now closed and all tanning bed salons in my area do not sell it so I found it on Amazon and just had to purchase it! It gives you great color and the smell is divine!</li>
    <li> Got a nice tan with this one. Gotta love that bronzer! No nasty scents. Will deffinitly use this one again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! And cheap too.</li>
    <li> Excellent tanning/Bronzing lotion which does a great job. No sunscreen in this product. I use with Australian Gold 8 or 15 lotion to keep from burning. Well packaged and arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> Australian Gold Kiss Kiss Bronze Bronze 8.5 oz. is a great lotion.  I even use it in between tanning sessions.</li>
    <li> wife and kids like this and it&#x27;s cheaper with free freight than going to the store, gas,and walking around.  nice product</li>
    <li> This to me is a beginners lotion.. Great moisturizer...But not too much of a bronzer. Will recommend but I will not purchase a bottle (tried sample pack from lotions2go.com )</li>
    <li> Love It!! It&#x27;s a great product that helped me tan very well. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Australian Gold!! It&#x27;s also good to help get a base tan.</li>
    <li> This was great! It works wonderful, and it was here on time! I love it! I know where imma buy my tanning lotion ;) Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly - liked the tropical smell - was hoping it would produce a darker tan - but would purchase again.  Compared to what these indoor lotions cost at the tanning salon - the price here was a steal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; Australian Gold product. I like them because they don&#x27;t irritate my skin and always seem to moisturize and make my skin look great. I don&#x27;t use bronze products except when indoor tanning in the winter or early spring. For me they help even out initial tanning</li>
    <li> I love Australian Gold products, but do not like the bronze in tanning lotion...if not applied correctly, it will make you look stained.</li>
