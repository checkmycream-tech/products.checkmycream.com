<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Somebody finally invented a better toothpick.  Now that I am in my mid eighties and still have about 75% of my original teeth, my dentist recommended  these  tiny plastic combined spear and brush.  The label says gentle.  They may be gentle on most gums, and maybe I am not gentle enough in the usage, but I have from time to time drawn blood from my gums.  Not bleeding-bleeding, but a reddening at the gumline that can be rinsed away.  They are most useful for widely spaced teeth, but even narrow spaces can be penetrated a bit by the sharp flat point.  They had some kind of deal on 4 boxes and It looked good so I bit.  (no pun intended).  The mountain of picks is slowly melting, but it sure takes a while to use 1,100  professional picks carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them for anyone with at least two teeth adjacent to each other.</li>
    <li> Best toothpicks around.</li>
    <li> These are similar to the (apparently) discontinued Dentak dental picks.  The pointed end is a little bigger but it&#x27;s firm like like the Dentak.</li>
    <li> These are great - much better than wooden ones that can splinter between your teeth.  I like the little brush on one end to help keep your teeth clean</li>
    <li> Excellent product to alternate flossing away from home</li>
    <li> These brush picks are excellent.  Far more effective than flossing and much easier to use.  Can be used anywhere and subtlety.</li>
    <li> Good value.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very timely and lives up to expectations -- works better than toothpicks, would not call it a substitute for floss but is handy to have and use.  The plastic can occasionally prick one&#x27;s gums.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended these to me when I mentioned that my dentist warned be about my gums recessing. The first time I used these, my gums bled a great deal. This surprised me since I do floss every day, but it went away after using them a few times. I think for the price, even if it helps a little or slows the process, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I use these because I have trouble flossing - therefore I refuse to use floss.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m able to use these though - and just as pictured, there they really DO say 275 picks per pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brushpicks have much re-usability, but I was previously using each one for way too long.  By the time I would grab another, the ridges would wear out (I&#x27;m not talking about the &#x27;fishbone&#x27; part)..  And the new one would hurt my gums a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have a ton of these - I think a week for each one might be about right as a happy medium.</li>
    <li> They work as expected.  I like having a pack in my car and in the office.  Very handy!  Not sure the Dentist would say it replaces dental floss but if not, it&#x27;s close.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult with braces and these did not work. Hurt and got stuck.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. Bought for in-law who swears by them.</li>
    <li> Believe me, we&#x27;ve tried other brands, but they are soft and&lt;br /&gt;flimsy and don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re doing anything...in fact we&lt;br /&gt;threw away nearly a whole package of another brand that we&lt;br /&gt;picked up at Wal-mart...they just weren&#x27;t worth messing with.&lt;br /&gt;This brand however is solid and has a nice brush on the end.&lt;br /&gt;We just got the little travel dispenser of this brand also. That&lt;br /&gt;was a treat to find.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, very convenient, and a must have travel companion... I travel the world for work, and always make sure I bring Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks...</li>
    <li> These are better than using dental floss and less messy.  The package, once removed from the cardboard, is easy to store and to travel.</li>
    <li> do just what I expected and needed</li>
    <li> I have been using them for several years.  I love the feathered end because I have several teeth that are very close together and it fits between all my teeth.  It works like dental floss.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> After eating I get lots of food stuck between my teeth and always need a tooth pick. This is the best toothpick I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I find this product to be great value, love the product and the fact that it comes in larger pack size .</li>
    <li> As good as floss, but way easier to use.</li>
    <li> Best toothpicks ever!</li>
    <li> These picks are amazing truly amazing</li>
    <li> Best dental instruments I have used.  Easy to use and effective.</li>
    <li> For years used wooded flat picks &amp; then the double pointy end ones. Now that I have dentures I needed something better that would not destroy the appliances. Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks certainly do the job. Even easier &amp; better than flossing. Plastic container allows just 1 or 2 at a time to come out. I keep one in the car just in case. Will have enough for several lifetimes but was cheapest way to go. Give them away as gifts to older friends.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a couple of years and far less expensive than other such products.  Hated floss threaders.  Now with these, my Sonicaire toothbrush and Waterpik my teeth and gums have never been better.  My Dentists is so impressed that he is now telling his patients of these and he himself has purchased a Waterpik for his own use. I suggested that he may be working his way out of a job by telling his patients of these 2 mouth maintenance tools.  I myself use a product called Hydro-Pik also.  It basically is a Waterpik that attaches to your showerhead.  Love it.  Waterpik too makes a shower product.</li>
    <li> Great toothpick, does the job well, better than dental floss.</li>
    <li> Love these things, hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for over a year.  I just went to the dentist and my gum pockets have been reduced from twos through sixes to ones through fours.  They had told me the 6 mm pockets were something I might have to live with because brushing wouldn&#x27;t reach that deep.  Ha!  Keep a pack in your car, by your TV chair, by your bath sink and one at work.  Whenever you think about it, use one.  You&#x27;ll be surprised what comes out between your teeth, even after brushing.  Caution, though.  Don&#x27;t use too vigorously as they can lead to recessed gums in extreme cases.</li>
    <li> Spend the extra you \\&quot;cheap-skate\\&quot; and buy the G.U.M. brand.&lt;br /&gt;Your gums will be massaged. :)&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t allow your gums to be massacred by a micro miniature stiff needled pine tree!&lt;br /&gt;Happy gums are the key to a \\&quot;life time\\&quot; of permanent teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Take care and keep the Faith!</li>
    <li> very good toothpicks,use them all the time.</li>
    <li> I got tired of using floss and having it break (leaving remnants still stuck in my teeth which were difficult to remove). These brushpicks get everything out from between my teeth. The size and shape is ideal. I carry a small pack of them everwhere I go.</li>
    <li> This is a professional product..excellent quality...product is as advertised..I would recommend this product to my friends and to others. Quick shipping..no complaints</li>
    <li> Great picks - with a pointy end and a brush end, they get the job done!  Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> If you have teeth buy them and use them.  I think i&#x27;ll buy more for stocking stuffers this year.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t keep dental health optimal without these. Very simple yet very effective for regular dental cleaning.</li>
    <li> The only brush picks I&#x27;ve seen that hold up with use. Have tried 2-3 store brands and the brush parts fall off easily. Not only do they not work well, but hazard of swallowing small plastic pieces. The toothpick and brush are all from one piece here, so no danger of that. Brush also narrow enough to get between teeth.  There are still some times I use floss for more thorough plaque cleaning, but these are great for inbetween teeth and easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> I thought these were the same ones I ordered a while back which I loved but when i ordered the Brush Picks again they did not seem like the same. Not sure if my mistake or if they changed the picks. These are very hard, inflexible pieces of plastic and the *brushes* break off easily between your teeth. If you are looking for cheap plastic tooth picks I guess they are fine.</li>
    <li> Abosulutely the BEST toothpick ever. Do yourself a favor and buy a few of these so you do not run out because if yiou do, you will be sorry you did. Also be sure to buy a couple of the travel containers so you can carry enough with you without the bulge in your pants.</li>
    <li> Have used and will continue to buy. Hard to find in stores near me so have to buy online.</li>
    <li> These are the best tooth picks. I keep them at my desk and use them after lunch everyday. They help me avoid cavities.</li>
    <li> So glad I found these! My dentist even commented on the improved health of my gums. I use them all the time and keep them everywhere!!</li>
    <li> My family uses this every night.  Helps take out food particles from in between teeth.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, and as promised.  Very good job - thank you much.</li>
    <li> These packs cost around $6 each at our local pharmacy so it&#x27;s a great value to buy it here. My dentist recommended these to help clean between teeth and stimulate the gums to hell prevent bone loss, I use them every day and the dentist seems satisfied that we&#x27;re on the right track. I like that they are easier to use than the wire ones with bristles and these seem more sanitary because they a are intended for a single use. I only use the brush tip regularly but the pick end is useful and gentler than plastic or wooden toothpicks. I would recommend these to friends and plan to continue using them.</li>
    <li> love - keep them everywhere - in car, bag, overnight kit, nightstand, give them to people as parting gifts..work better than floss - much better.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are close together and floss tends to get caught and I panic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be fanatical about my teeth and keeping them in good shape, clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS BRAND ,  NOT THE GENERIC ones at Rite-Aid. Those are the worst.</li>
    <li> Item just as described &amp; works well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and find that this source offers a great price and delivers in a timely manner. Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are recommended by my dentist, but I started using them long before starting my dental care with him.</li>
    <li> Will definitely reorder,  bring these handy picks everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> these are great! use after every meal</li>
    <li> Been using these picks for several years.  They work great.  Always have a good checkup at the dentist who says whatever you are doing, keep doing it!!</li>
    <li> Perfect - he uses them all the time.</li>
    <li> Got my family hooked on these too</li>
    <li> No other toothpick is the same.  Great Product</li>
    <li> When you get food stuck in your teeth and you can&#x27;t seem to get it out, Brushpicks will. I don&#x27;t go to a steak house with out some.</li>
    <li> Horrible product - literally slices your gums.  I went back to using GUM softpicks.</li>
    <li> Excellent, exactly as ordered.</li>
    <li> These brush picks are great. Since I started using them daily 4 months ago I am reminded and the amount of material they remove and the ease they do it. I have never seen anything like them. According to an online review I read, flossing is not required when you use the Brushpick. They work for me at the cost of a couple cents a day.</li>
    <li> I like to use these before flossing to get more bacteria out and keep my gums healthy. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks, 275 Count (Pack of 4). These are so much better than wooden toothpicks. The pack of 4 made it very cost effective. Amazon shipped them quickly too.</li>
    <li> Some of my initial complaints:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I was excited to try something new to clean my built-in retainer (basically braces on the backs of my teeth), but the first &#x27;brushpick&#x27; I inserted broke. The &#x27;bristles&#x27; are pointy, painful, weak bits of plastic that just snapped, and it pokes into my gums and is quite uncomfortable.\\&quot; 3-stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I soon began to suspect, that was a harsh first impression, and thus I revise my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes do cause the gums to bleed at first, and occasionally the bristles or end of the brush bends until it&#x27;s too weak to do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took few uses before my gums stopped bleeding, and I&#x27;m finding these brush picks extremely useful. The packaging is pretty handy, I can keep a pack in my purse, one at work, one in my kitchen. My only complaint there would be that the top doesn&#x27;t open quite far enough, so that occasionally I have trouble getting a pick out.&lt;br /&gt;I use these things every day in my dental work, sometimes instead of flossing (because it&#x27;s faster) and sometimes in addition to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of each case advertises :&lt;br /&gt;1. Improved with Plyalene for longer lasting bristles.&lt;br /&gt;2. Extends between teeth gently and easily.&lt;br /&gt;3. Stimulates gums&lt;br /&gt;4. Brushes away debris.&lt;br /&gt;5. Will not harm dental and bridge work.&lt;br /&gt;6. Maneuvers and is held easily.&lt;br /&gt;7. Ridges safely scrapes away plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are really useful.</li>
    <li> I picked up some samples of these in my dentist&#x27;s office and was wowed by how effective they are. So much easier than dental floss to manipulate, though I still use floss on one problem spot that is prone to build up tartar. I have relatively old teeth that have seen several generations of dental restoration technology, and it it maneuvers around every thing fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a young boy with a complex orthodontic appliance (a \\&quot;crossbow\\&quot;), and he finds it very convenient for cleaning around that without damage or discomfort. I see a review next to mine in which the reviewer had trouble using the brushpick with his orthodontics. So, it depends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go slow. The point of the brush end is thin, hard, and sharp. Great for getting between the teeth but you can send it past the gumline if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> Save  your teeth.  Buy these.  Even my dentist uses them.</li>
    <li> My parents love this product!</li>
    <li> Found these several years ago when they were readily available in stores, but now, they have mostly disappeared from store shelves.  They are an excellent replacement for floss.  My last 6-7 dental checkups have the assistants saying that there is little or nothing for them to do.  I attribute it to these picks, in combination with either of Dr. Collins Natural Vanilla Toothpaste or Kiss My Face Fluoride Free paste.</li>
    <li> These are handy, difficult to find in local stores, but handy to have when you do find.  I keep them in the bathroom to use during the day and a smaller package in my purse.  This is a great value, excellent investment.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and a very reliable seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I cannot find these in stores ANYWHERE.  THey are the only thing i will use to clean my teeth.  Wooden toothpicks break and get stuck...but not these!  I really think I need a 12 step program because I am addicted to them - one container for office, bathroom, car and kitchen!!  The price on Amazon is great so I am thrilled to be getting what I love at a good deal shipped FAST</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t overuse this pick as it can cause inflamation of the gums.  Inexpensive yes but beware.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years, but lately could not find in local stores. The pics do a better job than any I have used.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a really good product. Works much better than wood toothpicks.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, price, &amp; service.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> these are great for cleaning between teeth.  I really like these.</li>
    <li> Cannot recommend....stiff plastic bristles SCRATCH the gums vs. massaging and cleaning. Will use as a toothpick instead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with GUM Soft Packs...LOVE them vs. these brushpicks</li>
    <li> I have tried Gum Softpicks and Stimudents. Both pushed my gums back too much, and my hygienist noticed. The Stimudents can splinter and don&#x27;t hold up well when wet. The Softpicks were nice to use, but not good for someone with receding gums. They were also too thick to get in deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushpicks are great. I keep them in my purse, by the TV, in my car.  They look like toothpicks so I don&#x27;t feel conspicuous if I use them in public.  I hate flossing, so I don&#x27;t floss, but my plaque is minimal thanks to this product. I have big spaces between my teeth (receding gums), and these do the trick. I slant them at an angle so they really get in between the tooth and gum, but are slender enough to not push the gum back. They work better if you use a fresh one every time. Rarely, something will get wedged in deeply and I have to floss, but hardly ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all these products, your gums will be sensitive and will bleed a little until you get the bacteria and plaque off. I think these also stimulate blood flow and my gums have \\&quot;toughened up\\&quot; with regular use.</li>
    <li> These were hard to find locally, so I was really happy to see they were available through Amazon. I bought them for my husband, as there are no other picks that he has found that will so as good a job.</li>
    <li> We use these to refill the pocket containers.</li>
    <li> Love them and best price around</li>
    <li> I love these and buy them for myself and my Dad. We both have issues is &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; teeth and when flossing isn&#x27;t an option these are the next best thing! They are easy to use and do a great job, and they are able to go right in between the teeth, unlike regular toothpicks.</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that could stand up to food being stuck! I&#x27;ve tried a number of product and this one holds up to the challenge.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love, love, love these picks.  They are hard to find tho.  Would recommend them to every one. they are GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> I love brushpicks but sort of prefer the ones that are skinny and round on the end opposite the brush.  These are wedge shaped which works but not quite as flexible as the others.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product...if you have gum disease and floss just doesn&#x27;t get it done...this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;My dendist asked me what I was doing and he was the one that recommended this....I have been using these for about 3 years in conjuntion with Oral B floss action electric brushes and I am extremely happy with my progress.  This is a great great product.</li>
    <li> I tend to pick between my teeth a lot because the brush picks make it so easy and convenient. The seller also offers the brush picks at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> in fact it is not Brush Picks and has no Conical Brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a flat arrow with hard edges, not recommended for whom has gum inflammable.</li>
    <li> Works much better than wooded and other picks on market</li>
    <li> These are the best picks of any I have tried and this is the best value I have found.  Believe it or not they keep so stock up and enjoy.</li>
    <li> these are the very best. Doctors is so much better than the generic which is very much too stiff</li>
    <li> My husband loves these.  Our son gave him some a couple of years ago and ever since he won&#x27;t use any other picks.  I ordered from amazon, their price is the best!</li>
    <li> I have discovered a new dental care tool that is the bane and boon of my gums... That is a strange sentence. Anyway, my husband brought home these plastic toothpicks one day as he likes to chew on wooden toothpicks, straws, bottle caps, what have you, and this was a better thing for him to use to fiddle with his teeth. I checked them out and they are actually awesome.   There is a little brush of sorts on one end with tapering plastic teeth and a ridged angled flat end on the other side. Let me get the bad out of the way first: you gums will BLEED. A LOT. And this is coming from someone who flosses almost everyday, so my gums are not abandoned or anything. But you use the little brush end first to clear bigger stuff away (ow ow OW) and then the flat end to scrape away the hardened plaque second. So, while being painful, I assume it would get better if I used them daily rather than just when I build up the guts to and have the time for some healthy masochism.   And right now, I just used it after brushing and flossing and my teeth are CLEAN. So this is a pro tip from someone who has no insurance--use these picks, I definitely think they improve dental health. They also apparently help prevent gum disease by stimulating the gums and getting rid of plaque. Ooh! But it is definitely painful to begin with. And that folks, is more than you ever wanted to know about my teeth. ^_^ And be gentle and support the brush end when you use it, it&#x27;s more delicate than the other side. But I have never tried something more effective that fits between my tight teeth full of repaired cavities.  Update: Still not using these every day, but the pain and bleeding is definitely reduced as you start using these more often. :-)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best toothpick ever.  When I go to the dentist, they tell me to keep the flossing up.  What they don&#x27;t know is that I never floss, just use one of these after each meal.</li>
    <li> These little plastic picks are awesome.  I can&#x27;t stand anything stuck between my teeth, but regular floss is a pain to use and often makes a projectile out of the food it dislodges (kind of like a slingshot)..Gross.  The tiny brush at the end of the pick ensures that all surfaces of the tooth are reached.  I highly recommend this product and the price is more than reasonable</li>
    <li> Too sharp and pointy. These are dangerous in the hands of anyone with dexterity issues.</li>
    <li> It really helps clean all side of your teeth. Recommend.</li>
    <li> These picks do a real good job.</li>
    <li> If you want a good dental check up, these are the things to use----regularly.</li>
    <li> This specific brand of tooth picks are the ONLY ones that will fit between ALL of my teeth.</li>
    <li> I use these every single day. They are very sturdy and clean around the edges of the teeth very well.</li>
    <li> Simply, the best toothpick on the market for those who care about their oral hygiene. I wish that I had come up with the idea. (And I wish that I had come up with a more environmentally friendly version of them.) ((P.S. if someone DOES actually come up with such a product, you owe me a piece of that moolah.))</li>
    <li> Quick ship, great product.</li>
    <li> I use these picks everyday after every meal. I love this product. When first trying these, it hurt and sometimes there was a light bleeding but that all stopped after a week of use. Flossing is still required to reach the spots that the brushpick is too thick to get between.</li>
    <li> The picks work very good at cleaning between the teeth and massaging the gums. The are very durable and work better than any toothpick I have ever tried in the past. Great product!</li>
    <li> And Amazon has them as a good price.  They&#x27;re hard to find locally.  Much better than using a wooden toothpick since there&#x27;s no chance of the pick splintering.  The two sides are different and the pick is flexible, making it very easy to use.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I take my dental hygiene very seriously. I tried traditional flossing and even did it the correct way but I still would be plagued with gingivitis. I don&#x27;t remember how I stumbled on these but if I hadn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know where I would be. My gingivitis is completely gone but it will return if I don&#x27;t use these for a few days so I keep myself well stocked on them. If I travel and lose these trust it turns into a bad trip. They take some adjusting to, a day or two, to keep used to how they scrape the gums (not too harshly but there will be some bleeding). I hope these are around for a long time as I haven&#x27;t found anything that work as well. I have also tried other models similar to this but they didn&#x27;t hold a candle to this product.</li>
    <li> After only a short time using these my dentist asked me what I am doing differently and I told him that I am using these brushpicks. He told me that my gum recession has gotten better. Easy to use where ever you may be vs floss.</li>
    <li> Five stars because my dentist says my guns are a 10. I never floss anymore I strictly use these after every single meal and there&#x27;s nothing building up between my teeth. I had periodontal desiese a few years ago but since I been using these tooth picks the health of my gums has improved dramatically. Occasionally I need to use more than one but its ok because the price per tooth pick is worth the money.</li>
    <li> LOVE them!! The best I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Replaced floss by 100%.  I have a container of them in my master bathrm, in my car, in my den...use them 24/7.</li>
    <li> I typically use the other brush pick types with the thicker plastic handle. Those have longer, fuller brushes. This product is really more of an enhanced toothpick. The pointed head has a flat brush and the point end has ridges to help scrape the particles from the tooth surface. It&#x27;s not as flexible as the other brush pick types but it will suffice and save money. Just be careful scraping near the gum line as the edges are a bit sharp.</li>
    <li> Was getting ready to re-order them, and was interested in what other people are saying - and thought I would add my review.  First off, if you haven&#x27;t used these in the past, they will hurt some and likely make your gums bleed.  And depending on how good you take care of your teeth, they may bleed A LOT.  But, you will be AMAZED all the horrific, smelly gunk the tiny filaments on the brush will pull out.  I must admit that I sort of hated them when I first started using them.  But, I couldn&#x27;t deny they were removing lots of stuff that flossing wasn&#x27;t getting (and that I really didn&#x27;t want in my mouth).  However, after about a week, I notice three things:  First was that my gums had stopped bleeding.  Second was that I wasn&#x27;t getting much \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; out any longer.  And finally, in places where it was really difficult to use them in the beginning, they now easily glided in and out.  I truly believe these were areas where my gums were swollen, and that they were finally starting to heal.  The bottom line is that while unpleasant to use in the beginning, they truly work.  And if you will give them a week or so, you will notice a huge difference.  I know that my dentist did when I recently went in for a check up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be without these brushpicks.  I started buying them in the stores but they&#x27;re hard to find.  I was glad that Amazon carries them.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but these are the best.</li>
    <li> better than brushing my dentist told me. I have healthy teeth enough said. very easy to use. even while driving ( Is that legal?)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brush picks for about two years, they&#x27;re fantastic. Much better than wood because they don&#x27;t splinter and do a much better job at getting between my teeth. You do have to be careful not to stab yourself because they are hard plastic but that aside if they&#x27;re used gently they are the best. I use them when I watch TV after dinner, you hardly know your using them and they do a great job cleaning out those little &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; that have gotten stuck in those hard to reach places so when you brush half the work is already done. BTW they really help keep your gums healthy too.</li>
    <li> These surprisingly work better than the wooden ones. They&#x27;re an excellent way of getting food out of those hard-to-reach places. Plus, it has such a good deal here on Amazon. Highly recommended item, this one.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years.  Love them.  And yes, they work better than floss.  These particular ones seem to be more durable and less wimpy--they don&#x27;t fold over and collapse after running them between a couple of teeth.  They are great to take with, to get that stuff out of your teeth when you&#x27;ve been to a restaurant.  They are great to keep at the table, to use after a meal.  They really make cleaning between the teeth an easy and almost enjoyable chore.  The bristles are soft, yet stiff enough to hold up to some abrasion and to remove little particles.  The pointy end is shaped like a wedge along the length of it, so it fits between the teeth right down at the gum line.  These are brilliantly designed tools.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> A lot of product for not much money. Easier to use than floss. You can clean your teeth and look sort of cool at the same time, if you live somewhere where having a toothpick in your mouth is OK.</li>
    <li> I have always been a dental floss person and never cared for toothpicks because they don&#x27;t really get between your teeth.  Somebody offered me a brush pic a  few years ago and I loved loved loved them.  I turned several people on to them and they also liked them a lot.  The brush side fits in between the teeth so they really feel clean.  I still use floss in the morning but supplement with brush pics throughout the day.  They are also much more discreet than floss.  I also tried a similar brand once because I couldn&#x27;t find Doctors in the store and I ended up throwing them out because they just did not get the job done.</li>
    <li> Purchased these from Pharmapacks, and as always, they never disappoint. Experienced superb customer service with all orders placed (so far),  I noticed that when I purchase the smaller packages of this particular product from a certain store, the picks are flimsy, and (the part you must hold onto to floss), begin to bend in every direction when I try to use them--This causes me to use 4 or more every time I floss, and due to the defect, I run out in a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 275 Count packages from PharmaPacks always remain sturdy, and maintain their shape throughout the flossing process.  As such, I use less whenever I use these. With this pack of 4, there&#x27;s no need for me to go to any store or pharmacy to purchase. As a matter of fact, I&#x27;ll soon be purchasing more from PharmaPacks to ensure I have a lot in stock.  Pharmapacks also package their products very well--To be more specific, the products I&#x27;ve purchased so far, have been packed well, and products received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> These are excellent for cleaning between teeth.  I especially like the end with the brushes because some of my teeth have small spaces between them &amp; the brushes do a great job with both tight &amp; spaced teeth.  The brush also does a good job of cleaning under my permanent bridge - where food gets trapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full dental reconstruction - 30 crowns, 1 bridge &amp; 25 root canals.  That makes me more prone to decay &amp; gum disease.  It is important for me to thoroughly clean between teeth to prevent frequent, expensive problems.  These brushpicks do a great job before flossing, which cleans below the gum line (between the gums &amp; the crowns).  I found similar products that were less expensive but they were too soft to get between tightly-fitted teeth.  These are just right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. MUCH better than toothpicks. They do an am aazing deep cleaning.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best brush picks I have ever used.  I am picky about keeping my teeth tartar clean.  These are fantastic.  Just make sure the right position is being used when inserting between teeth.</li>
    <li> So handy to carry with, great at giving a clean mouth after a sesame seed anything! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> When I first saw these things, I said \\&quot;there&#x27;s no way that thing is fitting between my teeth\\&quot;, but after using it I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with how effective they are.  It does a great job removing junk from the gum line, my teeth always feel great after using it.  It was pretty rough on my gums at first, but with continued use your gums get stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 4-pack of 275-count picks is a great deal at less than 1 cent per pick.  I took one pack and left it at work, another in the bathroom, and another in the car, so I always have one available.  There are generic versions, but the Amazon price is still better than what the generic versions cost in the drug store.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for many years after being told about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have two different ends, one side is really pointy and the other is sorta like a small brush.  You can use the brush end to go all the way through between your teeth and the pointy end is like a pick.  They don&#x27;t break and you can use one for your entire mouth.</li>
    <li> these are great for getting food out from between the teeth.  Use them every night before I brush.</li>
    <li> I had used these for years, then bought a similar product at Target made by Dentek. Well, the Dentek product is too fat, too rough, and generally a disappointment. These do a terrific job of getting out food between teeth that no toothbrush can touch. My dental hygienist always spends my appointment telling me how clean my teeth are, so they must work.</li>
    <li> I have issues with deep holes in between my teeth where food gets stuck, this bad boy does the trick, its not as good as a metal toothpick you can buy, but for sticking in your car or at work, I have like 2 things in my car, home and at work for lunch breaks and stuff.</li>
    <li> After using for a couple of weeks my gums feel 100% better. Very easy to use and so convenient. Awesome price for a 4 pack.</li>
    <li> These are great to use in between teeth that are too tight for floss.  The tiny brush end goes easily between tight teeth.  My dentist commented on how much cleaner my teeth were and how much better my gums looked.  The only thing I did differently was use these picks.  I hardly ever use the pick end of these.  It&#x27;s almost like a toothpick.  My 85 year old mother loves these things.  She uses these after meals and then brushes her teeth in the morning and at night.  Her teeth seem to be in good shape, too.  I love this large package, too.  It lasts for quite awhile.  The only negative thing I have to say is the lid is hard to open.  It would be nice if it had some type of colored mark to show you where it opens.  All the packaging is clear and it&#x27;s hard to tell which way to slide it open.  I have to store my mother&#x27;s in a cup because she can&#x27;t open the dispenser.  Prices are great on Amazon.  Don&#x27;t know how I ever did without these.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and easy to use.</li>
    <li> DANGER!!!  WARNING!!!  CHOKING HAZARD!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had for many years been a staunch supporter of The Doctors Brush Pics, however, they have changed the design and it now presents a seriously dangerous choking hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have choked on these broken off pieces on multiple occasions and now I&#x27;m going to throw this package out because of the safety hazard that it presents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hacked and coughed and tried to get the little pieces out of my throat and out of my sinuses (trying to dislodge them occasionally moves them up into the sinus cavities) without much success each time this has happened.  I have absolutely no idea what effect this will have on my digestive tract and sinuses.  Will it go through my system without causing damage?  Will it Lodge in some location where it will eventually be covered over by my body&#x27;s immune system and create a cyst?  Will it be a focal point of some medical issue in the future?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous designs had a very sturdy if perhaps somewhat large brush extension of the toothpick.  In order for it to fit properly one had to bend the tiny brush arms a little bit, but at least they stayed attached to the toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new design creates much finer features for the brush, however, they apparently did not run stress analysis on the design which looks like an insect antenna (a male mosquito).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conceptually, this is a superior design, however, they have implemented it using the wrong plastic.  When moving to a finer featured design, one must match the characteristics of the plastic to the expected stresses to be experienced by the product.  They have failed to do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that the Chinese manufacturer&#x27;s have done it again… They are using a less expensive plastic to save $.001 (a wild guess) rather than providing a product that is safe for consumers to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my sincere hope that the Doctors Companies recall this product and revert to the previous design or redesign this product for greater tensile strength, or move to a plastic which will survive typical use by a consumer.sign this product for greater tensile strength, or move to a plastic which will survive typical use by a consumer.</li>
    <li> On first use, every single tooth bled profusely from their chronic inflammation. Two weeks later, only 2 teeth are bleeding and my gums have progressed tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I floss before I pick, the picks still find plaque. If I floss after I pick, the floss always comes out clean. Throw away your floss and just use these for a simpler and more effective alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the GUM brand but they are less effective than flossing. Get these.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I fell in love the moment I tried it.  The brush feature does an excellent job removing items lodged along my gum line after meals when I&#x27;m unable to brush.  The &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; end is not like the bristles on a toothbrush, but instead like a mini tapered comb.  The opposite end is a pointed much like a conventional toothpick.  To me, it&#x27;s not an alternative to proper brushing and flossing, but when you&#x27;re on the run, on the plane, train, between meetings (getting that spinach out between teeth), this is a little more discrete and less messy than pulling out the floss.  I am carrying this in my purse in a small quantities. Good bye wooden toothpicks, hello brush picks!  Because it&#x27;s not wooden, it won&#x27;t break or splinter like wooden toothpicks.  This 4 pack has allowed me to keep one, and give the others to a friend, spouse and parent to try.</li>
    <li> These picks feel great on the gums (once you get used to them) and really do work well with pulling out stuck food (nasty).&lt;br /&gt;They strengthen up your gums and help stop with bleeding when flossing because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a while you get a pick with stiff bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I have a packet in my glove box, work, and at the office (to pick when no one&#x27;s looking).</li>
    <li> I love these I am so addicted to these they keep my gums very healthy good bang for you buck highly recommend especially for those younger family member that are lazy about flossing . Keep them in ER purse or in his backpack or car to be close by after meals less teeth cleanings needed and much less risk for gum disease</li>
    <li> these are the best brushpick they have come up with.  I can&#x27;t believe I ever used those old wooden one. yuk!</li>
    <li> They are so much better than anything else I have ever tried to use including all of the dental floss picks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for many years, and after I began with them the dental hygienist was pleased that I was flossing. 😉</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushpicks for several years now and they are wonderful.  As a nice added benefit, besides cleaning between you teeth, they keep your teeth plaque-free.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandmom. It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> These toothpicks really help to keep teeth feeling clean after eating thanks to their fuzzy end which fits between teeth &amp; scrubs!  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> These brush pics are the best ones ever made.  Our dentist recommends them and sure helps get all the stuff out between your teeth and helps the gums..  The best...</li>
    <li> Great product, and great bulk pricing compared to chain drugstores which only sell small packages. The small packages only contain approx. 10 picks and cost almost as much as this 275 count pack.</li>
    <li> Gave several away to  family and friends so they could try  them. In all cases everyone liked them. Will be ordering more when needed</li>
    <li> Best toothpicks in the world. The small brush side easily gets between teeth, to scrub out any food particles. I carry them in a small keychain holder, so I always have them with me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had gum problems for at least a decade, due to pockets formed following orthodotics.  I&#x27;d floss even more, brush longer, use a waterpik, and yet my dentists would routinely ask \\&quot;are you even flossing?\\&quot; as the problems continued on.  I found the Brushpicks four months ago and began using them twice a day, with a bit of toothpaste, to basically brush between my teeth and in to pockets between my molars.  What a difference -- my hygienist reports my gums are no longer bleeding, and my overall gum health is greatly improved.  They are now optimistic that with a year of this, my gums will hopefully recover even more.  Thank you Brushpicks!</li>
    <li> Best picks on the market. The thin brush end works great to replace floss use after every meal.</li>
    <li> I tried this a an alternative to the &amp;#34;soft-picks&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, they hurt my mouth. I do not know how anyone could use these other than for a toothpick.</li>
    <li> They are very good  and ordered more</li>
    <li> I carry these with me in my purse and my husband carries them in his pocket. My teeth are very close together so I have food stuck after I eat - anything! I use the brush side first and then the pick side. I still use dental floss at least once a day but you can&#x27;t sit at a restaurant table and floss but you can discreetly use the brush pick. If it&#x27;s bad, I excuse myself and go to the restroom. One time the drugstore was out so I bought there brand. Don&#x27;t! There is no substitute for a Doctor&#x27;s Brushpick. I gave some to my brother and his wife and they love these!</li>
    <li> The &#x27;Brushpick&#x27; is perfect. Far better than a toothpick. The tiny brushes really do catch little bits of food between the teeth. &amp;#34;Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks&amp;#34; are better than the previous brand I had been using called &amp;#34;DentaPicks&amp;#34;. Way more &#x27;bristles&#x27; and that makes all the difference. Stronger too.</li>
    <li> Item came as described.</li>
    <li> I love these dental pics so much that I bought several packs. I have to hide them from friends who covet them.</li>
    <li> use every day good price</li>
    <li> Our dentist gave a sample and it sure makes an improving difference. Highly recommend them. Must admit however that they work so well and feel so great that they may become addictive....but guess that isn&#x27;t a bad thing when it comes to tooth care.</li>
    <li> I have been using Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks for a few years with excelent results. Drug stores and grocerey stores are starting to replace them with their own brands, which are not as good as the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks brand, so I have started to purchase the product through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended brush picks. We use them every day. This brand is as good as any we&#x27;ve tried. Dentist is happy and we smile.</li>
    <li> I think these brushpicks are great. I am now addicted to them. I thought they were easy to get used to and I have sensitve teeth.  You definitely have to be careful in how hard you use them and watch the pointy sides but I would not do without them now. I am just not adept at string flossing and I have tried. I recently discovered these over a month ago and so between these and the other placker flossers, I am good. I find the brush end of the picks massaging and I love it. I didnt experience any bleeding but everyone is different.</li>
    <li> For sure, they are cheap, but they immediately started hurting my gums so bad, I couldn&#x27;t eat hard food for couple days! The idea is great, but I am switching to more expensive ones that are not so hard and rough on the gums. If you have sensitive gums, don&#x27;t go with this product.</li>
    <li> These brush picks are awesome.  They really get in all the nooks and crannies and the little brush just gets in there and does the job.</li>
    <li> is gentle on gum and can clean between teeth very well. Perfect when on the go and can&#x27;t floss or brush.</li>
    <li> 5 star all the way. Since using these Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks after eating, (every time I eat anything). My dentist appointments have been phenomenal. No tartar / plaque buildup between my teeth. They are much softer than what the dentist passes out for between teeth cleaning. They can get into tighter in between teeth areas with little to no pain.</li>
    <li> Is it just me? Am I the only one that has noticed that restaurants and eateries just don&#x27;t seem to have toothpicks anymore? It should be a law that if you serve chicken then you better have toothpicks at the ready. Every time I go out to eat with the wife I ask if she has any toothpick in her purse. The answer has always been no. Not sure why, everything else is in there. So I got these and the keychain holder to solve the problem. When they arrived I had to try them right away. They are perfect. They have the traditional pick end and also a &#x27;brush&#x27; end that works amazingly.</li>
    <li> I am a horrid flosser but with these it does not matter!  I have replaced flossing with the brushpicks and I have ZERO complaints from dentist.  In fact this with my sonicare has made my teeth nice and clean and routine cleanings at dentist are a lot shorter time-wise.</li>
    <li> If you have never tried these toothpicks you NEED to do so now.  They are the BEST ever!  Buy them!</li>
    <li> Excellent tooth picks!  Doctor&#x27;s also makes a similar toothpick that is flimsy which I don&#x27;t like so much, but these are a little more substantial so they do a better job.</li>
    <li> This product serves a special need for me.  I have a double crown over two teeth in the back of my mouth, and I have found that using these Brushpicks is much easier and much more convenient than using floss with a floss leader.  In addition, I carry several with me in a small pouch, so they are available wherever I&#x27;m at and whenever I need them.  Friends have tried them too, and some now use them continuously.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Love these picks. Buy them in bulk so I can leave them at friends and families houses so I always have one. Even my dentist loves them.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used these for several years. Now the only time we use regular toothpicks is when we eat out &amp; don&#x27;t have Brushpicks in the car with us. They are great!!!</li>
    <li> These are the best toothpicks EVER!  The pick on one end and little flat brush on the other makes them highly addictive!</li>
    <li> As you get older, your teeth separate a little and food gets lodged between them.  These toothpicks are small enought to get between your teeth.  They also massage your gums in the process.  My dentist is very impressed with the condition of my gums, and wanted to know what I was doing.  For me, this is better than flossing.  Love them!!!</li>
    <li> My brother Gary recommended these and it seems that once again he has gotten it right.I enjoy using them but will learn more.</li>
    <li> Aside from the obvious benefit of gum stimulation and cleaning between your teeth, these Brushpicks can be a good outlet for the urge to bite your fingernails.  Do you know someone struggling to break that nasty habit?  Gift them with a box of Brushpicks.  Replace a bad habit with a healthy habit!</li>
    <li> These are, without a doubt, the best toothpicks I have ever used.  Wooden toothpicks are usually too large and can cause damage to your teeth.  These have a tapered end and a feathered end and both do a great job between teeth.  The convenient case makes it easy to have one at home and one in the car.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpicks! I always have some in my purse, desk drawer, night stand and bathroom! Love to have them on hand everywhere!</li>
    <li> I feel the the brushes are far too soft 1 Definitely not the best flossers as claimed no more words</li>
    <li> This is so much better, more efficient, and pleasanter than flossing, flossing, flossing. Makes dental hygiene much easier and better.</li>
    <li> My husband is always at a loss for a toothpick that really extracts food from between his teeth and under his bridge. These are perfection.</li>
    <li> Best toothpick on this planet, as far as I&#x27;m concerned!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  I will continue to purchase these from now on.</li>
    <li> Dental hygenist says my teeth are so clean, she is amazed. I told her and the dentist that I never floss, just use these, which are much more convenient. They agree.....&amp;#34;keep on doing what youre doing......&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this may sound gross but you&#x27;d be AMAZED how much food you will find between your teeth with these, even AFTER brushing.</li>
    <li> These work very well for us and they are easy to carry around.  Our dentist like us using them if out check-ups are any indication.</li>
    <li> I love these brush picks.  I keep a container of them in my home, my RV and each of my vehicles.</li>
    <li> I was a big hit in China when I pulled these out after a big meal of ribs. Their culture is big on cleaning between teeth after such a meal. The were raving about how well it worked and very pleased I had brought this &#x27;new device&#x27; to their country.</li>
    <li> I love these so much I believe I have ordered them three times now.  I order them from Amazon because I can get a bigger box of them than I can in the store and I don&#x27;t have to go all over town looking for them.  With the prime membership I get them in two days and just love the convenience.</li>
    <li> This is the best dental product on the market - even my dental hygienist cannot believe how great they keep my teeth between cleanings - using only once a day.</li>
    <li> These are made of hard plastic, they are neither comfortable nor effective, can cut the gums, can have bristles break and get stuck between the teeth. I would recommend Sotf-Picks instead, those are everything these are picks are not.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful.  I&#x27;ve had an issue with a space between 2 caps for years.  The dentist replace both at no charge, but the replacements weren&#x27;t right either.  I changed dentists, but these were recommended.  I keep them everywhere (office, purse, home, car) and my friends love them too.</li>
    <li> These toothpicks are addictive. I ordered the bulk of 4x275ea and keep one in my car, my nightstand, in the kitchen, and in my purse. The bristle end fits in between my teeth at the bottom at the gum and while floss will reach down into the tooth, these really remove food and stimulate the gums. My gums are super strong, moreso than when I only flossed (and not enough :-) and my dentist thought my teeth and gums were in great shape. So much easier to use than floss, and since I use them many times a day, my dentist said he&#x27;d rather me do that then when I wasn&#x27;t flossing enough.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected, but does the job I bought them to do.</li>
    <li> I ordered a pack of these, not the 275 count pack of four.&lt;br /&gt;They were also by Doctor&#x27;s, but not the same pick.  They did not have a flexible end, and were too thick to go between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I threw those away, and ordered these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the ones like the ones I have used for years.  I like everything about them.&lt;br /&gt;They also make my gums bleed, but not a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing seeing the crap they get out from between my teeth and crowns,&lt;br /&gt;especially after brushing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are cheap enough to buy for friends or stocking stuffers!  I keep one pack in each car,&lt;br /&gt;and throw some in my purses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use each one about five times before throwing it away.  And I have never gotten an infection.</li>
    <li> been using these for years; I recommend them to my patients; funny thing: my wife got me started on them, and I&#x27;m the dentist!</li>
    <li> These picks get into small crevices and poke out any food stuffs and help massage the gums. I use after ever meal.  Have been using for years and keep some in car and on every floor in the house. One end is pointed and the other &amp;#34;tree&amp;#34; like.  Have seen some critiques that they are too firm - do not agree.  have not had any negative problems with them.</li>
    <li> There are a number of other types of plastic toothpicks out there, but these are the originals and are still the best by far.</li>
    <li> The picks are OK, if a little hard. The slider cap on the packaging broke, though, which makes them slightly less portable than I hoped.</li>
    <li> Much better than the average toothpick. Has great brushes to clean areas that could have been missed.</li>
    <li> I love these floss picks, and I honestly feel the need to grab one after every meal. I have a stock of these at my house.</li>
    <li> Clearly, the best toothpick in the world.</li>
    <li> These are all I use to help clean my teeth after a meal. Sturdy and yet very bendable. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever ordered  on.the internet.  These tooth picks are the very best ever.  My wife and I use them daily.</li>
    <li> These things aren&#x27;t very good. They&#x27;re okay for about four specific areas in my teeth, but overall I would prefer a wooden toothpick. If I were to go this route again, I would get disposable picks with a hoop end and dental floss. Give me an old fashioned wooden toothpick any day over these plastic twigs. Not to mention, and only thought about this after the fact....wooden toothpicks biodegrade and plastic ones don&#x27;t. Also, these nasty little plastic picks could get stuck in an animals throat and would never soften and go down like a wooden one. These things do work to an extent, but the overall negatives outweigh the positives in the end.</li>
    <li> I keep brushpicks in my pocket all the time for keeping teeth clean. I&#x27;ll by more when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I am surprised at how much I like these little things. I keep them in my car and even after brushing my teeth I will notice something between my teeth and they always scour it out, one handed so better than flossing when you&#x27;re on the go. They are gentle but effective, a big improvement on the wooden toothpick.</li>
    <li> No idea what most other people in the reviews are talking about, the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; on the end is so bendable I&#x27;m shocked anyone is able to use it. the bristles of the brush bend too, so it reduces to a flimsy extension of an otherwise mediocre toothpick</li>
    <li> Nice and comfortable with this value pack I reall got a deal recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> When I place the picks between my teeth, they bend too easily.  It still works, but they are not easy to hold because they are so flexible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, but I think I prefer GUM Soft Picks.  Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are vertical while GUM Soft Picks&#x27; bristles are very thin and a little softer than Doctors.</li>
    <li> Best toothpicks EVER!  I bought these at my local store and later had to order online when I couldn&#x27;t find them.  They are so much easier to use for me then floss.  I have one problem tooth where food always gets caught and this little brush fits I  just perfect between my teeth to remove any food.</li>
    <li> I think this is best pick in the market. work well and price is good.</li>
    <li> Truly a well thought out &#x27;complete toothpick&#x27;</li>
    <li> These Brushpiks are the best item for getting food out of hard to reach areas in between your teeth. They&#x27;re sturdy and don&#x27;t break , and reach in the smallest areas . Excellent product !</li>
    <li> I was always the person who hated flossing. One day I read an article about the correlation between heart disease and bad dental hygiene and realized I had to change my ways. Boy am I glad I did! I love these. My teeth look years younger and my gums are healthy. They have become cathartic in a way. I love flossing now and it feels weird to skip a day. Thank you Brush Picks!</li>
    <li> Have used these for years and introduced to a dentist who found them very good for teeth and gum care. Result? He began handing them to patients to try at home, etc. These have been very helpful to my wife and I in caring for teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> When I first used these picks... YIKES! It looked like I had been socked in the mouth by the amount of blood I was spitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started reading up on gum disease and how gums should not bleed easily. I kept using the picks and I am now past the first week. It&#x27;s been tough, but my gums feel better, look better and don&#x27;t bleed at all in some areas and just a little where the disease was real bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should be using these, I cannot believe how much my gums have improved!</li>
    <li> These are the best toothpicks I have ever used. I keep a couple in my wallet, because they are so thin. As I have gotten older, using the old style wood ones, whether round or flat, could only be used once and due to their size, according to my dentist, helped cause my gums to retreat. These have two different style ends. Even if you use it once and throw it away, they are awesome.</li>
    <li> Good value and great for people (me) who are not fond of floss.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at Walmart, but they stopped carrying them and replaced them with Dentek.  I much prefer this brand (Doctor&#x27;s) because the picks are round and easy to twirl between my fingers, which provides greater cleaning flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dentek picks have a stiffer brush that is less comfortable on my gums and a flat shaft that cannot be twirled easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Doctor&#x27;s brush, being softer, begins to break down and lose effectiveness more rapidly than the Dentek brush.  But I prefer Doctor&#x27;s overall because they&#x27;re less irritating to my gums and easier to manipulate.</li>
    <li> These are very effective at getting gunk from between the teeth but I would be careful to use them gently.  Follow the instructions carefully as you have to insert them with the  little teeth horizontal to your gums which seems counter intuitive at first.  It&#x27;s good if you already have healthy gums.  If your gums bleed heavily or are inflamed, I&#x27;d check with your dentist or start with a regular flossing routine and then building up to these one your gums are stronger.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some brush picks.  The reviews showed a good value; i.e., 1,100 brush picks in total.  Trustingly, I opened all four outer packagings from each of the four packs for easier storage.  Upon later opening one container to use one, I became aware that these have teeny, tiny, little bitty plastic protrusions where the brush is supposed to be; however, they are only two-sided plastic protrusions which makes them of absolutely NO VALUE WHATSOEVER beyond being a simple, plastic toothpick.  I know that I could return them, as Amazon has the best customer satisfaction service in the world; but, as I had already removed them from the package. I decided to just take the loss and give them to the local Food Bank for distribution.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR BRUSH PICKS - DO NOT BUY THESE.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR OVER-PRICED, EXPENSIVE, BUT CHEAPLY MADE PLASTIC TOOTHPICKS, THEN BY ALL MEANS WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE.</li>
    <li> I keep these in my car and also in my shoulder bag for use on the road and at work.  I still floss before bedtime but these are a life saver after a lunch of chicken wings.  I use the brush end first then follow up with the pick end.  It makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Having used these for Years I read that these have caused Gum Damage because they are Hard Plastic they worked well but my Gums will need attention now.The Name &amp;#34;Doctors&amp;#34; is no implication that they are safe,just a Name.</li>
    <li> These are the only ones that work for me.  They are great and because they are thin, they never hurt!</li>
    <li> The best for flossing I have ever used.</li>
    <li> These things are super great for people who do not like to or forget to floss very often.  I was trying to floss as much as possible, trying to remember to do it before brushing each day.  But I was still having to get my teeth cleaned 3 to 4 times a year despite using a sonic brush and everything.  And even then I was still having the occasional issue with my gums.  Then I found these things.  I use them all day long, after coffee and breakfast, after lunch and after dinner, after any snacks.  One toothpick can last me all day if I like, or I&#x27;ll use multiple ones through the day.  Now when I get my teeth cleaned they say they are looking wonderful!  It takes half the time to clean my teeth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously had to use Glide type floss in my teeth.  Even so, I would still shred and break the floss in certain areas.  The dentist even had a hard time getting floss out.  I do need to use the brush end in a couple of other teeth to soften it up a bit before I can put it into those really tight teeth but it fits!  It really does, and I could barely get the glide floss to fit in there if that tells you anything.  I am convinced these clean better than floss, are easier to use and handle and last a lot longer.  Not only that but I think they &amp;#34;toughened&amp;#34; my gums up.  I pretty much never bleed anymore and my gums are a healthy pink.  I won&#x27;t let myself run out of these ever again.</li>
    <li> We love these picks. When teeth are close these help when you have eaten.</li>
    <li> Attention all you food stuck in teeth haters! Drop your wooden toothpicks. These are the best. They work better than floss and are easy to carry around.  I started out by buying the small containers of them so  I could have them everywhere, and then bought the four pack of 250 so I can refill the smaller containers. Once you try them you will never be without them!</li>
    <li> more versatile than the rotapoints but they still don&#x27;t really replace floss.  Great product otherwise and i keep a box of these in each car, at work, in the kitchen, etc...</li>
    <li> I got these as they were a lot cheaper than the softpicks. really didn&#x27;t do the same job. small hard plastic fan like head. I cant get them between my teeth nearly as well. i ended up tossing them in a drawer. Haven&#x27;t used except one time i didnt have the other. For me not worth having.</li>
    <li> We have had them  before.  They are very good.</li>
    <li> These are FANTASTIC - they are WONDERFUL....what a pleasure and fun to use these.  My god, all that pulling with the flood that is always \\&quot;shredding\\&quot; and coming apart in between your teeth but never gets into ALL the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I took a chance on these - I was going to order toothpicks so I could at least PICK some of the food out but when I saw these and read the description and saw the amount given in an order, well I went for it.  They are so great - they go into the tiniest little spaces - they clean out every little bit of food and that little brush end is something else.  I will never use floss again.  I highly recommend you folks try these at least .... and you&#x27;ll see that I am not exaggerating one tiny bit !!!  I love them, love, love, love !!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Doctors Brushpicks are the best my husband and I have used, we have tried other similar products but found these have the strength. The shape of the brush part itself (arrow) is great, much better than white glo.&lt;br /&gt;We live in New Zealand and have only found this product a couple of times. So when I was searching the Internet I found them on Amazon and ordered two packs of four units. 275 picks in each unit for the same price per unit we paid here for a small pack of 60-80. These will lasts us forever so so pleased. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great value! Works as indicated. One pack for my car, one for my office, one for the family, one as back stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this item because I am quite picky.</li>
    <li> AS I get older, I&#x27;m 68 now, my teeth are moving closer together.  These are the only toothpicks that I have found that will go between my teeth.  I use one every day and carry them in my purse and travel bag. They go everywhere with me.!!!</li>
    <li> These little tooth picks are wonderful. Gets into the cracks between your teeth like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These things are great.  I usually buy the small pack at the grocery store, but i bought these on impulse.  Better hope you&#x27;re supplying a small army, otherwise you&#x27;ll be like me and have enough picks for the next 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have permanent braces on my lower teeth, so it&#x27;s impossible to floss them.  My method is to use both floss and the picks.  My ritual is 1:30 after lunch, floss in the bathroom, then return to my desk, bust out one of these, and pick away while checking emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are very stiff, so don&#x27;t chew these like wooden toothpicks.  You could chip a tooth.</li>
    <li> I took contact with this brushpicks ome years ago. I travel to states once an year for 3 months. I adore them and almost my family and friends adopt them and ask me to brougth evy year. For me is the solution.</li>
    <li> Very good product, have been using for years. Very easy to use and very thorough and clean. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of this cause I can&#x27;t find other alternatives, what I don&#x27;t like is the plastic brush some of it are being left inside between teeth they are small so some of them are getting loose. Since I can&#x27;t find other picks better than this one I will continue using until I find better one.</li>
    <li> . . . dental wax can&#x27;t do what these little plastic picks/brushes can do. And, they&#x27;re so much easier to use than that hard-to-hold waxed thread! What the pick cannot reach, the thin brush can. It&#x27;s a perfect match. I can&#x27;t brush my teeth without using a brushpick first; it just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if only the manufacturer would throw in a free plastic travel pouch to carry a few in my purse, I&#x27;d be even happier!!!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful to have on hand in between flossing!</li>
    <li> Have used these for some years now and my wife and I both think there great.</li>
    <li> These are our favorites and we can&#x27;t always find them at CVS.</li>
    <li> Best price for these brushpicks that we use regularly</li>
    <li> The best for cleaning around the gum line, although I wish the brush didn&#x27;t break off so easily. Not so good for flossing between teeth - you really need the plastic dental flossers for that.</li>
    <li> I am an active proselytizer for these, forcibly demanding that people try them.  As soon as they do--they invariably ask, &amp;#34;where can I get these???&amp;#34;  They are amazing at getting between teeth and sweeping out bits of food and plaque, especially the &amp;#34;fish-bone&amp;#34; shaped side.  I keep a container at home and one at work--these are a post-lunch life saver.  Do you teeth and gums (and friends!) a favor and try the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks!</li>
    <li> I keep one box in the bathroom, bed room, and in my purse.  Use Brushpicks everyday, keep the dentist away.</li>
    <li> Since a few years back, the gum around some of my teeth receded and the gaps increased between teeth. Since then, flossing was no longer adequate. I tried using double floss as my dentist suggested, no help. I tried so many interdental picks and brushpicks. So far the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks is one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interdental picks usually comes with a cover, with much denser soft toothbrush like brushes. These are very effective to clean my larger teeth gaps. However, they&#x27;re so large and full, I only use them occasionally so as not to cause further gum receding. Because the interdental brushes are more expensive, I clean them and reuse them a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Amazon price on the Doctor&#x27;s brushpicks bulk pack, I throw away after each use. The disposable brushpicks usually come with only two rows of brushes. I started with a more expensive brand that had only six small brushes on each pick. While the Doctor&#x27;s brand (and another brand) comes with about a dozen small brushes on each pick, and is much more effective. After using brushpicks for a few years, I can honest say the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are one of the best brushpicks I&#x27;ve used. When I use these brush heads between teeth in straight in and out fashion and never force my way in, they rarely irritate the gum. I&#x27;ve never used the bare diamond end of the pick so I can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note is that I do use electric brush, floss, and the brushpicks to maintain my teeth and gum between dentist visits. If I stop using the floss or the brushpicks for a few days, my gum will sound alarm and remind me of such. So for me, the brushpicks are not a replacement for flossing, but definitely a value addition at home, and a convenient quick substitute when dinning out.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;don&#x27;t have the time to write a book.................................................................................longer review required,longer review required...doesn&#x27;t make any sense...still not enough, you gotta be kidding</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how long these have been on the market, I hope not long, as I would hate to think I have been using wood picks when these were available.  I sure am glad that Sam&#x27;s Club quit caring toothpicks, as I would have never discovered these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the top for the first time can be a challenge.  The entire center section of top, slides in the direction indicated. It does not lift up, nor does it push down. Stick your thumbnail in the end, and it will slide open. Trying to slide it by pressing your thumb on the knurled surface is fruitless. Ignore all the things on top that look like holes that need to be drilled out or pushed in.</li>
    <li> These are great, but a little spendy.  They are great if you have larger gaps between your teeth towards your gums as opposed to the chewing surfaces.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I despise using dental floss but these easy-to-use picks make my dentist happy and the brush tickles.  Hard to find.</li>
    <li> These picks are 10 times better than toothpicks.  They find and remove hidden food particles and leaves your teeth and gums clean and refreshed.  I ordered the &amp;#34;Doctor&#x27;s&amp;#34; product because I tried the store brand and the quality was far below these so I decided to stock up.  Thanks</li>
    <li> These little brush  picks sure come in handy when you discreetly need to remove food stuck between your teeth.  Handy to keep in your purse.</li>
    <li> Read all of the reviews about these, and you will get opinions all over the place. Here is what I can tell you:&lt;br /&gt;1 - These are INCREDIBLY effective tools for oral hygiene. More comprehensive than dental floss and more efficient than a normal flat toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;2 - YES, your gums will bleed when you first start using these. As a regular flosser (~5x/week), it took me nearly 2 weeks of 1x/day use to get my gums to stop bleeding. Not that they caused pain, but my gums did bleed.&lt;br /&gt;3 - YES, you can abandon dental floss for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a cavity and will absolutely credit these for good periodontal hygiene over the past 2-3 years. They are initially tough to use. Very hard to get into the crevices between your teeth without bending the brush portion. But, if you stick with it, you will see that your gums begin to get used to them. Keeping up a 1x/day routine is also pretty important. If you stop using them for a week, you may need to go through the &amp;#34;re-bleedening&amp;#34; process again, and who wants that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to some reviewers, you ARE supposed to work the brush portion in between the gaps of your teeth. I do this first to get out all the larger particulate. And then, you flip it around and use the pick portion to go back through again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for 2-3 years with no floss and my teeth are cleaner than ever.</li>
    <li> The description sounded good but the product did not live up to its claim. I was expecting something more like the Soft Picks which has a bristle brush whereas these do not. They are made of hard plastic which have sharp edges and can, and do, lacerate the gums. Also I found that they are pretty thick and do not fit well between every tooth.</li>
    <li> excellent, sometimes hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> These brush picks are the best! They are thinned soft and do not tear up the gums as do other stuff brands I have tried. I gave some to a friend and she loved them as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best next thing to a toothbrush but much smaller.  Very gentle on the gums and between the teeth.  Performance is impressive.</li>
    <li> Best. Product. Ever. Recommended to my entire family! What a terrific product. Ordered the entire case... It is perfect. Awesome</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  I selected these from a grab bag of picks supplied on the last dentist visit. Fits into very tight access.  Does not completely replace floss because as with any pick you can&#x27;t get the correct angle for the rearmost teeth.  I use the thin spire with the brush end on it the most.  Be aware that it is a 275 count in each of the units in a pack of 4.  I got surprised but won&#x27;t need to reorder for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love these - very convenient for work or travel.</li>
    <li> This is a great interproximal brush for over 1 penny each, I tell all my dental patients to use it since Oct, 2013</li>
    <li> A terrific product! Really gets the job done,. I found these on a clearance sale at CVS and loved them but could never find them anywhere again. So glad I checked online and found them. Cannot understand why no store seems to carry this item anymore.</li>
    <li> they get in between the teeth without any problem. not up on top, but next to the gum line. work great, too. i use them daily and miss them if there is no floss around.</li>
    <li> These work wonderfully and so very portable, I find myself sharing with friends because they are so useful and convenient to carry around!</li>
    <li> Came as expected and it is a must to clean the teeth after flossing. Would buy it again. this is my second time buying it.</li>
    <li> I have used these for several years! They are Absolutely the best!</li>
    <li> These brush picks are meant to provide an alternative to flossing. I use them everyday, but I would suggest using them in tandem with flossing, to really do a great job. The picks have two ends, one feathered for finer work, and a pick end. My only complaint is that the feathered end can easily break off, but that might simply be a question of how strongly I floss or apply them. I do use them regularly and have bought them repeatedly.</li>
    <li> I was getting cavities every 6 months till I started using these daily with brushing and flossing, I have not had a cavity since.</li>
    <li> We love these brushpicks. You can easily take them anywherer. They work very well. We have been using them for years.</li>
    <li> Love how these things can get your teeth cleaned.  Surprised to find they work better than wooden ones and do a great job of getting in between teeth and, with the little brush on one end, latching on to little particles that just don&#x27;t usually come out easily.</li>
    <li> Great product really clean food between your teeth</li>
    <li> This is good!  Sent some to my sister and she likes it...not too coarse but cleans between your teeth and it slides in between tight spots.</li>
    <li> it is hard to use the pick and it hurts</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing these.  I can&#x27;t always find them in the stores and my parents can&#x27;t find them at all in South Carolina so I share with them.  These work great on both large gaps between the teeth and almost no gap.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT - better than dental floss, and a great price!</li>
    <li> They are one of the best Toothpicks, don&#x27;t forget to &amp;#34;recycle them&amp;#34; They are good at getting in between teeth when a wood toothpick is too thick</li>
    <li> I bought these and just love them.  Solved a big problem for me, a small gap between two upper crowns which tends to collect food particles in an irritating way.  Great to carry when you are out to dinner, as opposed to trying to use floss in a restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I liked them too much, and started substituting them for nightly flossing.  Then, one of my old crowns came off when I chewed on an unexpectedly sticky piece of toffee.  My dentist said he could just re-cement it, a great result.  BUT, he said I had something he had never seen in his 40 years of dental practice, that is, a deep groove in the gum between the two teeth.  I think I was just lucky that the old crown&#x27;s cement had failed, because otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have realized that I was damaging my gums.  And, this was on the lower jaw, not the place between the upper crowns where I most often used the brushpicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So enjoy them, but (my advice) don&#x27;t use them as a substitute for floss without checking very carefully to see (if you even can) if you are wearing nasty grooves in your gum between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Got so many people addicted to them. so great! It really cleans and gets to hard to get places. Bought a bunch to give to family and friends.</li>
    <li> These little brush picks work well to clean between teeth, they have strengthened my gums and leave my mouth feeling very clean.  Sturdier than toothpicks and with the little brush, there is no comparison. Still keep dental floss around for those pesky corn kernals that get wedged other than that, it is brushpicks for me.</li>
    <li> I love these toothpicks with the brush, I do not use wooden toothpicks anymore.  My teeth are close together and I can get between them with the brush cleaning them good.</li>
    <li> Like it. Quality made.</li>
    <li> They are very useful to use and hold up very well.  I recommend them to everyone who needs to help with food removal.</li>
    <li> This is my second order - I&#x27;ve never gone back to using wooden toothpicks once I tried these.  Not only are they a LOT easier to insert between your teeth, they last through several uses.  I&#x27;ve even used those I&#x27;ve found in my shirt pocket after leaving them to go through the wash cycle!  I love the holders for keeping them on your key chain as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I&#x27;ve given them to has loved them as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Very nice product. Efficient and useful.&lt;br /&gt;The thread is strong and does good job. I think it is a must have.</li>
    <li> These are excellent.  They fit into tightly spaced teeth: many times they work better than flossing for removing those irritating crumbs</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpick available, and a near-suitable replacement for tedious flossing if you use it between every tooth daily.  It won&#x27;t get below the gums, so it&#x27;s not technically a floss avoider, but it&#x27;s better than nothing.  However, by dentist said my gums were good and I&#x27;m doing a good job of flossing, but I don&#x27;t actually floss much.  I use these every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them in the car when there is nothing going on any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be surprised in a bad way what comes out from between your teeth.  I&#x27;ll leave it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the picks are weak on one end and will flop sideways instead of sinking in between theeth.  this is maybe one in 20 picks, and they are cheap enough not to worry about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot.  Better than tooth picks.  The older ones were stronger but thicker so toss up.  The little brushes break pretty easy. Hopefully they will find a happy medium.</li>
    <li> If you want to keep your teeth, one needs to clean them with these brush picks. These also add to and make for healthy gums. A must for all if us who have our own teeth!</li>
    <li> I have used them for years and think they are the best. I plan to keep using them for a long time. I have only one filling in my mouth. I am 83 years young! :)</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get them through my teeth</li>
    <li> Looks like Doctor&#x27;s (Brand) just increased the count on these from 250 to 275. Was wondering why they were getting hard to find for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They work great, they are small plastic toothpicks, which means you can bend them easily if you need to. Also they have a small tiny \\&quot;brush\\&quot; made with small plastic filaments in a diamond pattern at one end which helps sweep away debris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Note: do not insert the \\&quot;brush\\&quot; portion and rotate or twist the brush end between your teeth and gums, that is NOT what they are designed to be used for... (per my dentist: if you have sensitive or bleeding gums you can damage gum tissue this way) If your gum tissue and pockets are in reasonably healthy condition you may be able to get a way with a bit of twist, but you can damage healthy tissue scrubbing away with an extreme twirling motion. That&#x27;s why I suggest caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Frankly most drugstores and other stores only carry the smaller packages more expensive packages of these. This was a four-pack of the 275-count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I gave two of the packs to a friend at work after I saw him using a different \\&quot;floss pick\\&quot; device, and he says he just loves these compared to the one he was using: [[ASIN:B002WTCK1E DenTek Easy Angle Floss Picks]]</li>
    <li> I had read other reviews after I placed my order and was prepared to be disappointed with service. But brushpicks came on time with no problems. I knew that I liked the product. All turned out well.</li>
    <li> I finished one box from the drugstore and came here to get more. I don&#x27;t like flossing because I often break a nail doing it--I don&#x27;t know why. Brushpicks are easier to use, especially if you don&#x27;t have a mirror handy. The gaps between my teeth vary in size and brushpicks work for all of them.</li>
    <li> I found these products on Amazon several years ago.  I found them to be effective in cleaning between my teeth.  The brush end wears out before the pick end, but that is similar to the other brush types.  The pic end has ridges on it to help remove plaque.  Like any other device you need to use them carefully so you don&#x27;t do damage to your gums.  I&#x27;ve recommended these to several friends and they have had improved oral hygiene, as witnessed by their dentists and/or hygienists  These are a bargain compared to other brand name products and they can be used as long as they hold up.  4 stars, not 5, due to some weakness in the brush end.</li>
    <li> We have been using Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks for about three years and can&#x27;t go anyway without them.  We had been unable to find the larger container in stores, and then we decided to look on Amazon. We tried using a cheaper version, but they just fell apart.  These are great for those who can&#x27;t floss after every meal.  We carry them in our car and with us at all times.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, quick delivery, detailed description</li>
    <li> These really get the food out from between the teeth. Much better than floss.</li>
    <li> Pretty good one. My mum likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> I started using various brush picks etc because my hygienist got on my case about my gums.  I have always been a faithful flosser but this wasn&#x27;t doing anything, apparently, for my gums.  And then I found these at a retail outlet (which shall remain anonymous) and at my next cleaning my hygienist asked me what I was doing and that whatever I was doing was working really well.  I&#x27;ve been a believer ever since.  However, I was concerned that the previously mentioned retail outlet might discontinue offering this product so I found them here and purchased a sizable supply.  And I haven&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> You get a lot for your money but these things are pretty harsh and painful to actually floss with. The pick end works ok. Will not be buying these again, however I have a lifetime&#x27;s supply now!</li>
    <li> My dentist and oral hygienist agree that these have made a significant contribution to the health of my gums and teeth. The brushes are fine enough they will fit between most of my teeth (but of course not between the crowded ones) and they remove debris and also massage and stimulate the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who sees these asks us for some, and we are delighted to oblige.</li>
    <li> The bristles are harsh on the gums and disintegrate very quickly – after using them between a tooth or two. The stem is also fragile and prone to snapping off. It&#x27;s almost like no one has even tested this product before selling it. At least it&#x27;s cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GUM Softpicks are a far superior product, but much too expensive. I&#x27;m still looking for a good alternative.</li>
    <li> Best tooth pick ever!!!</li>
    <li> Best thing since Floss...I use it regularly and seems to help</li>
    <li> Great product. Use them all the time. Better than floss in my book</li>
    <li> Meet all of my requirements</li>
    <li> These work very well.  Does a great job between the teeth.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these and can&#x27;t function without them. She keeps a pack in her car, her handbag, and in various places around the house. I prefer dental floss but she&#x27;s been in love with these every since she got them during the dental braces period of her life.</li>
    <li> Brushpicks are good, especially with braces, but not better than flossing! It is difficult for any product to outrank flossing at the gumline. If it wasn&#x27;t for that gumline issue, i would definitely rate them a 5 star!</li>
    <li> I got braces (again) as an adult. A waterpik I bought has been the biggest help in keeping my teeth clean after eating, but these brush picks are great for on the go. They easily fit into a pocketbook &amp; obviously don&#x27;t weigh much. They&#x27;re great at work for a quick cleaning. They get rid of the debri that gum doesn&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with poking my gums or any other problems with these. They are good for being moved up or down between brackets or for cleaning at your gums.</li>
    <li> This works well between brushing to remove food from between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Awesome value for money!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the best darn toothpick on the market. No splinters like from wooden ones, and the little brush on the end works great for the hard to get to places.</li>
    <li> had a hard time getting these but now that I found them at a good price I will be back for more</li>
    <li> The perfect toothpick.  The bristle end does a great job cleaning between the teeth.  The other end is a very sturdy toothpick that does the job without damaging the gums.</li>
    <li> This beats regular toothpicks by a HUGE margin!</li>
    <li> These are the best tooth picks ever.  I have introduced them to many others and they love them.  So easy to get online compared to shopping for them and they are always out.</li>
    <li> These picks get into the small tight spaces. Clean very well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do without these!</li>
    <li> It comes with 4 individual packs. I bought it for a friend in Hong Kong. She said the ones bought in Asian is less strong. The case has a sliding lid that makes it very handy for taking it out with you. I found similar ones in Walmart price a little cheaper but the case does not have a lid.</li>
    <li> They work great - share with family and friends</li>
    <li> This is useful as a toothpick only.  For me it wasn&#x27;t useful as a flossing tool because it doesn&#x27;t fit between my teeth at all.  If your teeth are tightly fitted together like mine, floss is about the only thing that with fit in that almost non existent gap.  I can shove one of these in there but it will cause my gums to bleed.  These are probably excellent if your teeth have some space between them and you will still like them as a toothpick no matter what, but it gets three stars from me because the package says &amp;#34;better than flossing&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispensing case is really cool and it works like a charm.  I will probably buy these again, but I&#x27;m still flossing.</li>
    <li> Best brushpicks I have found.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Best toothpicks for me that I&#x27;ve encountered at this point.</li>
    <li> I have become so enamored of these that I can hardly imagine living without them. I keep one of the small portable containers in my pocket and a few times a day clean between my teeth. I get any stuck food cleared and my gums are happy as can be.</li>
    <li> These are sharp and painful. The brush end is very small, and irritating. Sending them back.</li>
    <li> Best toothpicks I know of.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product if you get the right pick.  The feathered end makes it.  I ordered before and received a different pick than was on the lable.  i order this time and received what i ordered.  picks are great.  quick shipment.  don&#x27;t know what happened last time.</li>
    <li> I got some of these in a Xmas stocking years ago (sample size from the 99 cent store), I was so sad when I got down to my last one that I&#x27;ve been carrying it around with me for at least 5 years. So glad to have found these, I don&#x27;t understand other reviews that say they are painful, maybe they&#x27;re using them wrong. I do wonder where all the little bristles from the brush end end up, as it is completely naked after a few uses throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate biting into something then feeling it stuck in-between my teeth only to be stuck like that for who knows how long. These are nice as they come in a case small enough to carry around conveniently and have two different ends for doing different types of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with it, is that it would be nice if the bristle end was a little stronger so it didn&#x27;t bend out of shape after just two uses while cleaning the mouth.</li>
    <li> I always have at least one brushpick on me, and always a pack of them in any of my bags I frequently use. I&#x27;ve been using them for years ever since someone offered me one and will not go a day without using them. Amazing product that keeps those hard to reach spaces clean. If you&#x27;ve never flossed you will think you&#x27;re murdering your gums, but nope! You just never took care of them properly.</li>
    <li> Work better than floss or toothpicks; can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
    <li> For a person who doesn&#x27;t like to floss, my dentist of all people recommended these. I&#x27;m hooked ! Toothpick on the one side, brush like on the other.</li>
    <li> When I ordered these, I thought they were nylon bristle brushes on one end. They are not! They are a flat bristle molded as part of the toothpick.  So much the better! I wondered how they could be so cheap. They are simply molded plastic toothpicks with tiny flexible tines on the other end. Oh, and the pick side has a few small ridges on the flattened sides, for clearing plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you:  THEY ARE AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and kids thought I was crazy when I started to rave about these things. They are perfect for anyone who maintains some pretty regular oral hygiene. You can get out the toughest of food particles or stringy fibers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, it&#x27;s true. The toothpick end is knife-shaped: sharp at the point and pretty rigid.  But, I think that is one the best features!  This shape allows you to insert the pick into the gaps of teeth, right at the gum line, and clean both teeth with a few passes, in &amp; out. The fact that the pick is knife-thin on one side, allows it to fit in the gaps between closely spaced teeth.  Use the thick side up on the top teeth, then thick side down on the bottom teeth.  If you use them this way, they are quite comfortable - DAY 1! The pick alone will dislodge most food particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush on the other end is molded onto a thin rod that fits into even tighter spaces that the pick side.  The brush can then be manipulated as needed to get even the most stubborn food particles dislodged.  I often spin the whole pick/brush to allow the brush side to do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father was a big toothpick guy, the wooden kind, but I could never get get them to work for me. They didn&#x27;t fit between my teeth.  I could never direct the point to the right place to get the food out. I NOW KNOW THE GLORY OF USING A GOOD TOOTHPICK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a better device for cleaning between my teeth - PERIOD!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY &#x27;EM!  USE &#x27;EM!!  You&#x27;ll love &#x27;em!!!</li>
    <li> These brushpicks are awesome. I have been using them now for about 4 years and I always have them with me. The brush end is so good and getting those minute particles out from between your teeth. The do seem to now be as strong as they use to be. They bend easier now then in the past.</li>
    <li> Well thought I&#x27;d give these a try the reviews seemed good.  But they just seem so flimsy, and just don&#x27;t cut it to get out anything really stuck between your teeth.  It maybe that my teeth are very tight together but personally I don&#x27;t like at all.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe better for some though.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased The Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks in a small package from a retail store and loved them. When it was time buy more, I ordered a large quantity through Amazon. Each package holds 275 of these delightful dental cleaning devices, but I cannot open the package! I have a little arthritis in my hands. My husband was able to open it once, but somehow it slid closed. When we tried again, neither of us was able to get the little plastic tab to push down while sliding back the lid. We had to break it open. Definitely not arthritis-friendly. Otherwise it would be a five-star product.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I had been buying them in the store, liked them and wanted a bunch to keep on hand and share.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the container, the picks that I used to have and the picks illustrated on the PACKAGE are a totally different design!!! The brush part is stiffer and the brushes are shorter. The projections do not stick out far enough on the sides to adequately do the job. Very very disappointed. I like the original design and have no idea why the product pictured on the package is totally different than the actual product.! I am still using these because I have so dang many of them. I will not be reordering. I will buy them in the store.</li>
    <li> Can not do with out them keep them with me all the time</li>
    <li> Have been using for two years now and an excellent product for cleaning teeth. Brush gets most of what the pick cannot. Would like mor strength on shaft of the brush and the packaging is hard to open, so I leave it open.</li>
    <li> Seem to work the best for me , Dentist sugested that I try the Brushpicks , they work better than a regular tootpick anything that helps is a good thing .</li>
    <li> not bad, does the job if you can get it between the teeth :-)</li>
    <li> These sturdy plastic toothpicks worked better than flossing.  I flossed as I normally do, and then I used the picks.  The picks did a better job.</li>
    <li> Good Brushpicks, but I wish I would have read more of the reviews before purchasing these.  My gums bleed using these because they are rougher that the GUM brand that uses soft rubber brushes.  If your gums are in great condition, these should work fine, but if you have any pockets in your gums your best bet is to get something softer until your gums are healthy enough to handle these brush picks.</li>
    <li> Better than a toothpick</li>
    <li> These are really different.  They have tiny soft feathers of plastic which slip down by the gum line, and really get between the teeth well.  They are remarkably better than regular wood toothpicks, and in addition, catch more than dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knew?</li>
    <li> The brushpicks is stiffer than I thought. It may cause traumatic gum bleed if I am don&#x27;t use it gently.</li>
    <li> Keeps my dentist happy with me.</li>
    <li> If they ever stop producing this I will probably lose my mind.  These are a God send.  They on my regular reorder.</li>
    <li> Much more convenient than floss, in fact, I carry a few with me any time I think I might eat something, keep some upstairs and downstairs and in my car too, because after using them for a while, I simply can&#x27;t stand the feeling of food in my teeth.  Now I&#x27;m finding my dental cleaning visits are really short too.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are the best toothpicks ever!  My teeth are not real tight together, so they work perfect.  If your teeth have no space between them, then you&#x27;ll probably need floss😉</li>
    <li> You can really clean your teeth with these.  Reasonably priced too. A friend told me about these.  I use the firm end to clean my finger nails too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushpicks for about 3 years now. I used to buy them in the store, but can no longer find them there so I always order them from Amazon. Food always gets stuck in my teeth (I have deep periodontal pockets) and dental floss sometimes pack food even further into my gums. Regular toothpicks just don&#x27;t work that well for me.I do not go ANYWHERE without my brushpicks.</li>
    <li> If you are constantly getting food stuck between your teeth and wooden toothpicks are not for you (never find consistent sizes, they break off in your mouth, you don&#x27;t want to use toothpicks from a dispenser in a restaurant ) these are for you. They are double ended with a tapered pick at one end and a feathered &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; at the other. They work very well, are convenient (especially if you order the refillable keychain containers) and inexpensive. My grandson has braces and carries these brushpicks with him for gentle cleaning at school or on the go. This is one of my favorite products ever.</li>
    <li> We have been using this item for quite some time but the stores where we bought them quit carrying them.  Finally found them on Amazon and this is our second order.  The price is right and delivery is outstanding.  If you haven&#x27;t used these, give them a try.  Much better than floss and easier to carry around.</li>
    <li> Feels so good when I use them.  Easy to use and make my teeth feel really fresh and clean. So glad that I found them.</li>
    <li> How can you not need or use these? simple effective cheap...I could go on....These plus sonic are equals reduced dentistry needs and thus saves a bundle.</li>
    <li> My gums are receding due to a medication I have to take, so flossing doesn&#x27;t do well for me. Since I&#x27;ve stopped using floss and started using these brushpicks, my gums are in much better condition. These clear out food debris very well without causing your gums to bleed.</li>
    <li> Where were these things for the last 50 years?  These picks work great in conjunction with flossing, since flossing quickly just moves the food downwards towards the gums.  These picks move the food out quickly from between the teeth.  Floss can be made to work that way, but moving the floss back and forth after going down between the teeth first takes a long time to do, and is difficult for youngsters to master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy, quick.  The only concern I have is that the manufacturing technique leaves some noticeable variation in the width of the picks.  The human mouth is very sensitive to microns of variation, so it probably would cost too much to make them the same size within microns batch to batch.  The difference is only noticeable when you have tight teeth, and some boxes of picks fit in between most teeth, while other boxes have slightly larger picks and only fit between a smaller number of those teeth.  But overall, this product is a real winner!</li>
    <li> Good for me but for tight teeth you still need floos</li>
    <li> These are like little tiny instruments of torture. They rip, poke, and even cut the gum flesh between your teeth. I made a mistake not paying the higher price for GUM picks. I&#x27;m throwing these away.</li>
    <li> My sister turned me on to these little gems.  I have a lot of crowns and I am constantly battling to keep food from being trapped between them.  Since I added these brush picks to my regular dental regimen I have noticed a lot less inflammation around my crowns, which is a big deal if you have crowns.  My dental hygienist told me at my last visit that my gums look healthier and my numbers are better than they have been in a while.  So if you have crowns or other dental work where food can get trapped, I would highly recommend using them.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot and my wife absolutely loves them. They do a much better job of cleaning your teeth than any other toothpick we have found. We use them often as a convenient to use alternative to flossing. In some situations I&#x27;ve found them actually better than flossing. We especially like the small plastic brush end, we find it&#x27;s great for spaces between teeth where food gets caught but is not necessarily noticeable. We got them in such a large quantity to save money and make sure we have plenty on hand in more than just one location.</li>
    <li> Great price. Just as described.</li>
    <li> Love there toothpicks</li>
    <li> These must be for mice.</li>
    <li> On my third order.  My husband and I keep these pics all over the house and in our cars.  They are also great for backpacking as they weigh almost nothing.</li>
    <li> These work great and the price is a great value.  I ordered enough to share with family who don&#x27;t live with me.</li>
    <li> Love these toothpicks, they&#x27;re the only ones I&#x27;ll use now. The only downside is that some are thicker than others and hard to get in between my teeth, so I just throw those ones away. Other than that, these work great.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for me.  I have some in my purse, in the car and by my recliner.  I do not use the wooden picks except to check on my cakes and other baking items.  Good for tight areas and does not break off like the wooden ones do.</li>
    <li> Better than wooden toothpicks. I carry them with me in my backpack and in the car. I also keep them at home.</li>
    <li> After about a week or two of using these, my gums toughened up and these are great.  Much better than a toothpick and floss (which I hate to use bc I have to slobber all over my hands to do a decent job).</li>
    <li> I had tried some from a friend and knew I liked them.  I wish the brush was a bit sturdier as they sometimes break before I&#x27;m finished using one.</li>
    <li> These are cheaper than getting them in smaller packages, although the smaller size is easier to carry. Just refill from the larger container. These picks work quite well between the teeth. Perhaps not the equivalent to dental floss. Sometimes the slide top does not open easily.</li>
    <li> Doctor Brushpicks are simply the best toothpicks on the market. You have a normal pick on one end and a thinner brush on the other. The brush gets into those hard to get places.</li>
    <li> I was given some brushpicks, but when I ran out I was unable to find any in the stores locally.  On line was the answer.</li>
    <li> Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are the perfect tool to root out food particles that I can&#x27;t budge with dental floss. I keep one pack in the bathroom and another in my travel kit.</li>
    <li> These work better than floss, effective cleaning between teeth you get a a lot of picks for a fair price.</li>
    <li> Not heavy enough gauge plastic.</li>
    <li> This was a reorder ... wonderful product at a reasonable price.  Nice ez to use tooth pick with a flexible small brush on one end.  I have a bridge on two back teeth ... this works GREAT vs flossing to remove food under the bridge.  The brush works works nice between the other teeth too.  Recommend this product without any reservation -- do not think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if you have ever tried these Brushpicks but they are really great.  However don&#x27;t keep sucking on them like a wooden mint toothpick as they have a strange chemical taste after awhile</li>
    <li> Have been using these starting after my spring check-up. Dental tech said &amp;#34;wow, you really floss multiple times daily&amp;#34;.  NOT, I use brushpicks all day long...</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I use it after every meal.</li>
    <li> These keep me from having a lot of tarter build up.</li>
    <li> Great product,I&amp;#34;m able to floss at any time</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be caught without these, keep a container n my vehicle, man cave and bathroom. These will remove 99.9% of what gets between your teeth (at least for me). I rarely use the pick end, just the brush end and as a result don&#x27;t have to pick up the floss only about once a month if that. Great product, just can&#x27;t find the large containers locally but Amazon fills that need..</li>
    <li> Fits in all but the tiniest of gaps and does a good job of cleaning I think.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re using these in addition to a Water Pik and regular floss.  Guess&lt;br /&gt;we&#x27;ll see at our next cleaning if it&#x27;s really effective.</li>
    <li> These are great at a low price. Great for cleaning between your teeth.</li>
    <li> Wish they weren&#x27;t white!!  These work great but they get set down on the bathroom counter by other family members and they blend in so well they can easily get knocked into the sink or caught on towels set on the counter.  Yes, throwing them away would be better but if they were a green color or other color it would help make sure they stand out!</li>
    <li> Love it.  very effective.</li>
    <li> I  have braces  and these picks are the best thing to have, And I will continue to use  them even when I get my braces off</li>
    <li> I have been using Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks for several years on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  Now I can&#x27;t be without them!  I  love to get the KUDOs from my dentist and dental hygienist during my check ups.  I found that by using the Brushpicks after meals and snacks, they do a better job than flossing. I positively recommend them!</li>
    <li> Way better than a plain toothpick. I couldn&#x27;t find them locally. My husband really loves them. I keep one &amp;#34;shaker&amp;#34; in my purse for convenience.</li>
    <li> What can I say - the stuff works!</li>
    <li> Love it .Already ued for a long time and only one we ued</li>
    <li> These toothpicks are wonderful!  Works great to massage your gums, so you can use less floss, which I hate to do!!  Plus no pieces of wood to pick out like wooden ones that break!!  You will love them!!</li>
    <li> They sure have cheapen them. They are very flimsy now the brush end breaks off. I would not recommend them anymore. They took a good product and made it a piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> They worked perfectly as expected!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> I know as I actually went hunting for them on line after my grocery store quit carrying them.  Do I like &#x27;em?  Why else would I buy a 4-pack of 275?  You will like them, too, I know.  They were delivered quickly and I am most satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love these! I use them like floss, especially where my brace lies behind my teeth. A wonderful product. I recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> For me, this works better than floss, which had a tendency to impact the meat deeper down into my gum. Brushpicks scrap the food lodged between the teeth and gum, pushing it through instead of deeper into the gum.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> So much better than a regular wooden toothpick. Really does the job.</li>
    <li> absolutely and unequivocally perfect for impossible to clean areas .</li>
    <li> I love these.  I buy them all the time and use them every day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Very economical!!</li>
    <li> I continue to order these for myself and friends....my favorite pics, better than the real brush type</li>
    <li> I have healthy gums, and have never had a cavity in my life at age 40...I wanted to try some newer picks to help cleaning my col areas, because I sometimes have difficulty doing a good job with just floss...so, I decided to try some newfangled toothpicks, including these.  The plastic tips are unforgiving, and the \\&quot;brushes\\&quot; are brittle and unforgiving as well.  I figure there&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;re called \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s\\&quot; BrushPicks, and not \\&quot;Dentist&#x27;s\\&quot;.  If you&#x27;re looking for something good that doesn&#x27;t rip your gum apart, I recommend the G·U·M SoftPicks instead (in fact, I&#x27;d give them 10 stars if I could.  I&#x27;ve recommended them to a number of family and friends as well, some of whom were already using these Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks, and they&#x27;ve all switched to the SoftPicks).</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions provided for using this toothpick and it worked pretty fine. I didn&#x27;t feel that the thinner end of the pick was useful though as it wasn&#x27;t firm enough to dislodge food particles effectively. Ultimately had to use the thicker end for scraping and dislodging.</li>
    <li> These are the best essentials for those who need to make sure they have clean teeth.  They do a great job.</li>
    <li> This is way better than regular floss</li>
    <li> These are a lovely choice. The old-fashioned wooden ones just don&#x27;t do very well in comparison; nor, in my opinion, do the totally hard plastic ones, which feel to me as if they hurt the enamel of my teech. These have a soft area that you clean with that if effective while not damaging enamel. The soft end does bend and give out a little too quickly to be perfect, but I have not found anyting better, yet.</li>
    <li> They work very well for cleaning behind bridge and in larger gaps. Good adjunct to floss and more conveniently portable. (I use this size to refill the smaller one.)</li>
    <li> These are by far one of my most favorite products. I cannot live without these and liked getting them in a pack of four so I don&#x27;t have to order them again for a while. I keep one at home, one at work, and one in my car. Great to have them everywhere!</li>
    <li> I am a chronic tooth flosser but hate normal floss because it&#x27;s a nightmare to try to get in between your teeth.  I have been using these picks for years now and I can&#x27;t get by one day without using them.  When I go in for teeth cleaning, the hygienist cannot believe how great my teeth look from using the picks.  You have to work up to using them daily if you don&#x27;t normally floss much because they will make you gums bleed if you&#x27;re not used to them.  After a few days, the bleeding will go away and your teeth will be clean and gums healthy.  It has been found in people who have died from strokes, heart attacks, etc. that there is bacteria from the gums and teeth in the tissues which could have contributed to the problem so flossing can keep this from happening.  The only slightly negative issue for me is that some of the picks are not usable because they aren&#x27;t stiff enough but there are plenty in the big packs so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these picks for years and they work very well - much better than a regular toothpick. The larger packs are harder to find in drugstores. A very good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these.  Unfortunately, they are more rigid, and the bristles are sharper and less flexible than the last picks (I thought this same brand) I purchased. Price was good, but I am somewhat disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> Much, much better than floss.</li>
    <li> Everyone with natural teeth should use one of these after every meal.  They&#x27;re wonderful in keep your oral hygiene at its highest level.  Whenever my husband and I go to our dentist for our semi-annual cleaning, the hygienists tell us that our mouths are the cleanest they&#x27;ve seen and they enjoy working on them!!!!  Of course, we floss and brush regularly too, but these brushpicks, when used after every meal, supplement the floss and toothbrush routine.</li>
    <li> Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are great for tight places and under bridges. Only think I will use now if I can.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re the best around!</li>
    <li> best toothpicks I have ever used. I hate plossing and this seems to do the job just fine. Second time I have purchased these</li>
    <li> Works well, everything as advertised</li>
    <li> For me this will be a lifetime supply, which is great! I am happy that I got these!!</li>
    <li> Great for gum care and great price!</li>
    <li> great item! can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Clever little product.  Mich better that regular toothpicks.  Does a nice job hetting food out of hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything better for cleaning the places my teeth like to trap food. Very versatile, but gentle on the gums.</li>
    <li> Perfect for wider spaces between teeth.  Great price, too! This is the only way to buy something I use so frequently.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without these brushpicks.  I use them in place of floss  routinely at least once a day and my dental health has improved so much.  I was never a good flosser because I didn&#x27;t seem to do it well and it gagged me.  Problem solved!</li>
    <li> I love these things!  They are really quite effective at getting food out from between teeth. Using these and then rinsing with water is a great way to clean your mouth after eating, especially when brushing and flossing are not possible.  These are excellent for people with manual dexterity problems who cannot manage floss.</li>
    <li> But, they work great!  It&#x27;s AMAZING how much stuff there is between one&#x27;s teeth after a meal!  I keep one in my desk and one at home.  My dentist has noticed too!  Good price at Amazon!</li>
    <li> Recommended it to my hygienist. She and her mom love it. You still need to floss though. Very convenient and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Have used these since they first came out and my dentist noticed a real difference. They are better than floss and more easy to use after each meal.  They are hard to find in most stores, so as usual I went to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I buy a few of these every year or so.  They work well and are easy to use and carry.  When my mother comes to town she always take a pack.</li>
    <li> four packs of 275 each. yes, you get 1,100 brushpicks for this price. this is the best deal. i love this product, best toothpick, really gets in there, solid material</li>
    <li> I have these everywhere, at work, home, my purse.  I have a freind who is also addicted - woudl recommend highly!</li>
    <li> these are great I will buy them as long as they make them really cleans your teeth good</li>
    <li> The Doctors Brush Picks are wonderful.  They are not the normal tooth pick. One end is feathered so it can get anything out of your teeth, even tiny bits of popcorn.  I always offer these to my friends when we go out to dinner and they always look them over and say &amp;#34;I never saw anything like this where did you get them&amp;#34;  My reply is Amazon.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need to sell the benefits of these. Anyone who has tried them usually love them. They remove all debris between the teeth but also massage the gums well.</li>
    <li> For my teeth these picks are perfect.  Primarily it is the brush part that I like, because it stimulates the gums and is much easier for me to use than floss.</li>
    <li> These work great. I use the brush end in between my teeth instead of flossing. My dentist says I hardly have any plaque when I go for a cleaning twice a year.</li>
    <li> Perfect dental care while on the run</li>
    <li> My husband swears by these.</li>
    <li> Best brush picks around.  My dentist doesn&#x27;t complain about me not flossing when I use these.</li>
    <li> Excellent price. Excellent seller.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says on the tin 😄</li>
    <li> Love these things. Work great.</li>
    <li> The plastic brush part is far too sharp. The pick side is OK, but gets too wide too early. You need quite the gap to use these effectively.</li>
    <li> This is a good supply of dental picks to refill smaller purse size carriers and also handy for am and pm teeth cleaning.</li>
    <li> Use them everyday throughout the day.  Helped me get a good report from my dentist.</li>
    <li> the older you get the better you like em</li>
    <li> These picks are made of hard plastic, with sharp edges, and they are too harsh on my gums, injuring them.  I prefer to stick with soft picks, floss and brushing, although my husband, who is persevering with these picks, tells me that they do get better over time. Still, I do not recommend them.  Am perplexed at all the super high ratings.</li>
    <li> Best product out there. These work!</li>
    <li> Best brush picks I have ever tried. I have been using them for several years and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without them. They get into places where only dental floss can.</li>
    <li> Love these. Will definitely recommend and buy again</li>
    <li> these little suckers are great for cleaning you teeth thumbs up to this item</li>
    <li> This Brushpicks is great and would like to recommend</li>
    <li> Excellent for cleaning between the teeth.</li>
    <li> These little gems really get the job done!  They reach in between even the tight spaces, removing leftover debris. &lt;br /&gt;We both like the duel sided ends.  What the brush can&#x27;t remove, the pick is sure to dislodge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I absolutely love them.  We use to buy them at Wal-Mart but they were getting harder and harder to find.  He decided to check on Amazon and there they were in all their glory, a huge 4 pack no less.  We ordered them right away.   Debi B.</li>
    <li> This are the best picks for keeping teeth and gums healthy.  The brush side actually holds together and makes it easy to get between teeth and remove debris.  The opposite side is a pointed pick that helps remove anything remaining and is textured to remove plaque.  I rarely use floss anymore (floss often cut my gum tissue and rarely removed food particles) and I have had much less tartar since using these, making cleanings easier.  They come in a plastic container which fits easily into my purse.  I keep a container in the bathroom, living room, and in my purse at all times and I use these after every meal.  I highly recommend these brushpicks!</li>
    <li> My mom introduced me to these. At the time, I thought that was a little odd, but once I started to use them, I understood she was sharing the good news. The Brushpicks are made of a strong and resilient material and shaped just right to do their best work. It&#x27;s a good feeling to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Our dentist asked both my husband and me what we have been doing differently? He noticed our gums were in great condition, plaque and tartar were greatly reduced.</li>
    <li> The Doctors picks work great. I&#x27;ve never had my teeth feel cleaner other than going to the dentist and getting them cleaned. It is also a great price compared to buying them at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Great stimulant for the gums, great for removing popcorn and other food particles.  My Dental hygienist gave me a sample and recommended them; so do I.</li>
    <li> Wow when you have something caught in your teeth, we have found these are about the best especially when you are not at home and can&#x27;t floss to get something out.  I usually end up with my gum a little sore after I get it out but these work the best for our family</li>
    <li> These are the best brushpicks I&#x27;ve ever used.  They are sturdy enough that they don&#x27;t break off between my teeth and the bristles do a wonderful job when I twist them around.  My dentist tells me what a good job I do caring for my teeth which consists of this product and my Sonicare toothbrush [[ASIN:B00YAR86BY Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite+ electric rechargeable toothbrush, HX8911]] that I would never be without.  If you haven&#x27;t tried these you are missing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard plastic containers are convenient to store around the house, office and cars and with 275 in each container they last a long time.</li>
    <li> These things work great I even recommended them to my dentist for them to recommend to their patients. I carry these in my car and keep them at my office so there always available after I eat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;brushpicks&amp;#34; for years. It&#x27;s an excellent product. Helps keep my teeth clean, at home or when I&#x27;m away on a trip.</li>
    <li> Ok first and foremost I bought these as industrial strength toothpicks. They work perfect as such.  One side will come with a brush that you can easily tear off, and that&#x27;s the side you want to keep in your mouth while the other side serves as an edge to remove any obstacles in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bought these was because ordinary wooden toothpicks break easily and snap about two minutes in while I&#x27;m griping it in between my teeth.  These are substantially much harder to snap, and are still somewhat comfortable.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for close to fifteen years now and credit the the lack of major tooth problems to their use. At my most recent cleaning the hygenist said my teeth were great, and as I don&#x27;t floss but do use these after every meal I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re the reason.</li>
    <li> Soooo, I&#x27;d been using the GUM picks for a couple of years and recently ran out. Came to Amazon to order more GUM picks and stumbled upon these. You get more, they&#x27;re cheaper than the GUM picks and have so many great reviews, so it seemed like a no brainer! When I received the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks, I was excited to try them out... Well, the plastic brush on the end is a VERY HARD plastic and not as flexible as the GUM picks. They were more difficult to get in between my teeth, more difficult to reach in between my molars in the back and the hard plastic brushes shredded my gums. I continued to try using them, but by the time I was done, in every spot that I inserted the brush, my gums were bleeding. I tried again the next day, but first I massaged the plastic brush tip to try and soften it a bit before using - but to no avail. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but these little things are vicious - and they hurt!! I&#x27;m going back to the GUM picks. So if you&#x27;re gums are sensitive and bleed easily, or if you need to get in between molars or wisdom teeth way in the back, then I suggest the GUM picks instead.</li>
    <li> Purchased these at the recommendation of my dentist.  The price is right; they do the job, just be certain to throw them away and DO NOT LITTER.  I WOULD PURCHASE THESE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Mom has tried several different toothpick-type cleaners and likes these best.  They do a good job between brushing and flossing, and do not get caught in her teeth.</li>
    <li> The texture feels firmer/sharper than the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still works well, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using several times per week. Alternate with floss.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been purchasing them for quite a while and were pleased to find them in such a large quantity. I</li>
    <li> This has to be the best thing I have every bought.  It is small enough to fit into my small spaces - at my last dental visit which was a week ago, I was told I have excellent hygiene!  I think it is due to using these every day.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this picks, my dental check ups have been great.  The dental assistant who does the cleaning thinks I use the floss regularly, not knowing that I do not use the FLOSS ever since I started to use this PICKS...  Great Stuff...</li>
    <li> My Mom got me on these toothpicks and I&#x27;m sure glad she did! Using dental floss give me the creeks and these picks are a great alternative. All the people I know who have tried these brushpicks like them.</li>
    <li> these have tiny brushes on the ends and they are super tiny and get into every area of the tooth and clean them out very nicely. especially great when i go out for the day and have no way of brushing my teeth, this is a really handy pack of cleaners. also if you have root canals and caps, bridges, ext, this works very well for were the floss can not get into. love these. also there are other brands but i find that their brushes are thicker and hurt make my gums bleed. with this brand, the brushes are super thin and very flexible, get into the tiniest of openings between teeth.</li>
    <li> I have been addicted to The Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks since my dentist introduced me to them. Then you could buy them in any Walmart but no more. I was so happy to find them on Amazon. If you haven&#x27;t tried them you must. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not falling in love with them the first time you use them (if you can fall in love with a toothpick. Maybe I need to get a life??)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. If you have big or tiny gaps between teeth, it can go right through. Forget about the old fashion way - the floss, which is not easy for me to do. Thank you for the vendor to come up with this desire. These picks can get to any spot. I will order from them again when I am finished with this order, which might last for a year.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks that came in the small red cap package.  They NEVER varied in brush size.  Many times now, I throw away brushes because they do not work on my teeth - they will not go into the space I need - they are too big.  I have no idea what is happening is production but I probably will not order again.  Too much waste.</li>
    <li> I love these picks!!! I can&#x27;t floss and they do the job my dentist recommends. They are easy to carry in your handbag or your backpack.</li>
    <li> The very best tooth-pics you could ever imagine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve substituted these for floss because they remove far more food particles. The two sides of each pick each are valuable for different places in the mouth. It&#x27;s also--and I know this sounds a little weird--kind of fun to use. I keep them in my car and, while driving, \\&quot;floss\\&quot; my teeth with these brushpicks.</li>
    <li> Neat idea, but the bristles on the &#x27;brush&#x27; end break off easily and leave little bits of plastic in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I find the toothpick side a bit too thick for my tastes.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with meat in my teeth.  When I am away from home with friends, I need something to get the meat out.  These work very well.  And I like them better than toothpicks.</li>
    <li> hi,&lt;br /&gt;- i was browsing around drugstores for those kind of toothpicks.&lt;br /&gt;- most of them are  flat. then i found tHE DOCTOR&#x27;S BRUSHPICKS today at CVS store&lt;br /&gt;  on story road /san jose/CA.&lt;br /&gt;- they look better, i like it right away and bought one box of 275 picks ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- BUT i still have one suggestion :  can you make the number 6 of 7 (maneuvers and&lt;br /&gt;  is held easily.) this part, the trunk, make it ROUND like a TUBE , not FLAT .</li>
    <li> Take on trips, always in the glove compartment.  Keep them by your toothbrush when too lazy to floss after every meal!</li>
    <li> Each night I water pik, then sonicare, then floss.  And now I&#x27;ve added Brushpicks as the last step.  Something about how the brush feels between my teeth makes me think that it&#x27;s doing something, even after the first 3 steps.  And what a fabulous thing to carry because if you have tight teeth, you can be annoyed all day with wedged food.  I carry floss, too, for those times but the brushpick is better for during the day when you&#x27;ve having a get-this-the-hell-out-of-my-teeth moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read people&#x27;s reviews where they say that they don&#x27;t floss and get great reports from their dentists on their home care using the brushpicks.  I don&#x27;t buy that and would never substitute floss for the brushpicks.  It&#x27;s an additional tool, not a replacement.  I know so many people around my age with all sorts of teeth issues, including extractions and implants, and of course older people who are really suffering with loose teeth.  I am trying my best to avoid this by going for a cleaning every 3 months and doing my home care, and Brushpicks seems like a fantastic tool.</li>
    <li> These things are great to keep in the house, car and yes, at work.</li>
    <li> These are decent tooth picks, but the bristles on the ends are very sharp and tore up between my gums and teeth. now of course i do have very tight teeth in places but still i would say look up the G.U.M brand, or equivalent as they have a more rubberized tip that works wonders</li>
    <li> These a pretty cheaply made and the brittles are really sharp. Maybe it&#x27;s just my teeth but they hurt and don&#x27;t clean very well. I now have over 1000 as I bought this pack and will be throwing them away.</li>
    <li> Being in the dental field, I know a good cleaning item. This is so easy to carry and keep everywhere, desk, table night stand, and in my purse when I go out to eat.</li>
    <li> good deal great price</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;m deployed as a member of SEAL team 6, The Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks, a towel, a bucket of water and a board are all I need when questioning a captured enemy.  The ablative edge of the knife-sharpened end is a superior way to really *dig* into somebody&#x27;s mouth.  Better still, the wire-brislte end, when placed between the teeth (even gently) will cause great pain and draw blood instantly.  (Seriously, these things are painful to use.  And it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m really jamming it betwixt my teeth.  I suppose they work great as a toothpick.  But if I wanted a toothpick I would have ordered a toothpick.  Would have been much cheaper.)</li>
    <li> They really are a good option to flossing. I&#x27;ve used them for years. I actually bought enough for years to come. I didn&#x27;t quite realize how many I ordered. Oh well...</li>
    <li> You teeth will thank you and so will your dentist.  Theses are amazing but addictive so be careful because once you start with these you can&#x27;t stop.  Product of the year and so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Good it does what i&#x27;ts supposed to do</li>
    <li> Great, Great, Great.  I bought them before and will buy them again, they get between my teeth and do a great job of getting food out.  I keep them in my purse with me and use them after all fruit and meals.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without them.</li>
    <li> Useful and resourceful .. I&#x27;ve used them for several years - found quantity at a good price.  Nice for expensive dental work, more comfortable than flossing ..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only toothpick to use. It has a little brush like side and a pick side. It&#x27;s flexible so it doesn&#x27;t hurt the teeth and it scrapes any food from between the teeth.</li>
    <li> My wife and I used them for a long time.  My wife still uses them daily and really likes them.  I like wooden toothpicks better because they clean the gums better.</li>
    <li> I use these brush picks every day faithfully.  I started when I had Invisilign braces and had to be very diligent with flossing after every meal.  I like this much better than flossing actually.  And it&#x27;s much easier and less messy.  I always have a pack of these in my purse.  The last two times I got my teeth cleaned, the dental hygenist asked what I was using because my gums were in such great condition and there was almost no plaque at all!  Yay brushpicks!</li>
    <li> These work better than toothpicks. Very useful.</li>
    <li> I have a tooth that chipped so I often have problems with getting food stuck in that spot and my gums are really sensitive to dental floss,  So I decided to give these a try based on the rating.  I am really glad I decided to give these a try.  They work great getting between my teeth, and really help remove plaque buildup and are easy on my gums,  I appreciate that you get so many per pack and that they come in nice clear container that shuts tight and opens easily.  I keep a pack at home, in my purse, in my car, and gave one to my husband who loves them now too.  Also when I visited my parents one day, I gave a few to my father who is big on toothpicks.  He and my mother both tried them and now they love them too.  I just ordered another 4pk just for them the other day.</li>
    <li> They help me keep my teeth healthy at a low cost. They are just stiff enough, if they were more stiff they wouldn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting food stuck between my teeth more often these days and needed something to keep in my car &amp; @ work--so this 4-pack works nicely (home, work, my car &amp; hubby&#x27;s car).  This does a better job than toothpicks and is more convenient than floss.</li>
    <li> These things are sweet. They have a pick on one end and a brush like floss feature on the other. They don&#x27;t fall apart like the cheap wooden ones. I keep them around for after meals and they work great.</li>
    <li> The two ends of the brush have their own special uses.  The &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; end gets into the smallest crevices, so much better than a conventional toothpick.  The pointed end massages the gums.  Although my dentist is a floss advocate, this works better for me - as my hygienist says, &amp;#34;whatever you&#x27;re going to do consistently&amp;#34;, and tells me my gums are in better shape than ever.  Best of all - it feels good - so I like using it any time!</li>
    <li> There are places in my mouth that I canot reach to remove food, except with the brush pick. Would have had to have expensive dental work done without it.  Lucy W.</li>
    <li> These brush picks were too wide and stiff 1.) to actually fit between some of my teeth, and 2.) on my delicate gums.  I was warned by my dentist that they could damage gums.  On the positive side, I did have some teeth that were far enough apart that these could effectively clean between them, but that wasn&#x27;t the case often enough to be really useful for me.  There is at least one brand of brush pick I know that are smaller and doesn&#x27;t use such a hard material.  I can reach into every space I need to without it actually hurting me or my gums.  I can&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> The Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks are the perfect pick for your gums and teeth.  I have used them for many years and my denist always says that my gums look really great.</li>
    <li> I have hard to reach areas I can&#x27;t even reach flossing and I love this product. I highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I returned these because they weren&#x27;t what I wanted.  I wanted picks with actual brushes on them and these just had plastic.</li>
    <li> I bought these because our dentist recommended them.  We have used them for several years and help to keep our teeth and gums clean.</li>
    <li> I belive in flossing, I really do, but (1). It take two hands. (2). It requires a little patience and focus. (3). It is not something one would normally do in polite company. These brushpicks seem to do an excellant job and can be used as casually as a toothpick at any time. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use these several times a day to keep my teeth clean.  Great for that space between crowns.</li>
    <li> I rated so low because I&#x27;m spending the time and efforts to just open the box everytime a  pick has to be used</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work for me as a flossing device as they don&#x27;t fit between my teeth.  Still effective as a toothpick though.  If it&#x27;s up to me I&#x27;d rather just buy wooden tooth picks for 1/4 the price.  My gf</li>
    <li> I use a great deal of this product, all the time, in between meals, snacks, when I am out and about......these are a must have .</li>
    <li> I am begging this company to make this product with a pick end that is stiff enough to pick food out of the crushing face of molars.  If that were to happen , this would be the ultimate toothpick in a great container.  The brush side is easily the best brush I have used after having tried every brand I&#x27;m aware of.  As is, I&#x27;m not really sure what the pick is good for other than maybe tracing your gumline along your tooth.  That may be OK, but not when your molars are full of crushed food.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dental hygienist, they are the best!  Every time I return for a dental cleaning I get rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I carry them every where and keep them bedside, near the TV and at my work desk, easy peasy!</li>
    <li> I find these brush picks to be so much better than fighting with floss.  I do not have to worry about forcing some bit of thread between tightly spaced teeth.  They do a great job of helping prevent gum disease too.</li>
    <li> Great tooth pick. None compare</li>
    <li> really like these picks and have them on subscribe and save so don&#x27;t ever have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine turn me onto these picks.  They work way better than floss.  They are a plastic toothpick with a small brush on one end.  It is just like a little toothbrush that gets between your teeth and \\&quot;brushes\\&quot; both sides of your teeth at the same time.  To me, the bristles are just the right size and strength.  There is also a nice pointed tip on the other end.  I keep one of the packs in my purse and have one in my car as well as a couple packs at home.</li>
    <li> Had a friend introduce us to these little wonders. SOOOO much better than regular wooden tooth picks that tend to have pieces break off  sending you into a panic. They are stiff enough to get through the teeth but flexible if you need to tweak &amp; bend them, which you cant do with wooden toothpicks.  LOVE THE BRUSH on the one end that you can twirl around and pull the food out with. Great for gum stimulation too.  We also purchased ......through Amazon.....\\&quot;The Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks Toothpicks 15 Pack Keychain Dispenser\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a little round refillable container that holds up to 15 brushpicks. Great for the purse, pocket, briefcase, luggage, office drawer, tackle box, bike saddlebag, glovebox, etc so we&#x27;re never without one.  There&#x27;s nothing worse than to have stuff stuck in between your teeth and aren&#x27;t at home.  We&#x27;ll never leave home without them.</li>
    <li> My dentist has given me several kinds of teeth cleaning products over the years, but for me personally, this is the one I like the most. It does a good job, is easier to use, fits between my teeth better than the others. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Heck do I absolutely detest flossing! But since my mom turned me onto these it has actually become almost pleasurable. These are fantastic and not like anything else for flossing on the market. The bristles are so fine and a perfect shape for getting in between teeth while massaging your gums. They can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> these little things are a life saver. I have been using this product for several years.</li>
    <li> picks are great. The lid on the 275 pick container is very difficult to operate.</li>
    <li> I discovered these last year at the local pharmacy. I bought my husband and me a year+ supply each. My gums are are in great shape from the funny little bristles. Last check up, the hygienist said my gums were in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> These are great. I keep a container at work and one at home. They get between teeth where normal toothpicks can&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Once I started using these, I do not use the regular wooden toothpicks any more.  This is like getting a floss and pick everytime I use them.  I have a pack with me everywhere I go.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but these are the best - not too thick and not too thin.</li>
    <li> Use these all the time.</li>
    <li> The only toothpicks that can get all my debris out between my teeth every time</li>
    <li> Our family uses these on a daily bases to upkeep teeth &amp; gums. Easy to use in addition to dental floss. Saved money by buying in bulk.</li>
    <li> I got some of these years ago at a close-by drugstore and when I went to get more they were no longer available. So, I looked on this site and voila!! Yay, they have them. These brushpicks work very good. They are plastic and have a pick on once side and a brush on the other. They are better to use than a toothpick because they are stronger and they last longer. You only need one LOL -- Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Howard Stern recommended.&lt;br /&gt;The best ones you will find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal here on Amazon as well. So inexpensive, and I feel like I have enough for a whole year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great. Take care of your mouth, people!!</li>
    <li> These are terrific. Just wish they came with a small case to put them in for the pocket. But the price is awesome for something that would have cost me so much more at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> These are great if you have very tight teeth as I do, no way a regular wooden toothpick works for me. I have them in the car, my purse, my desk drawer and everyone asks me for one after a meal... they are a hit. I used to use another brand but I can&#x27;t remember the name, but couldn&#x27;t get them between my teeth so luckily these work. What else can you say about a toothpick?</li>
    <li> We have tried many others, this is the very best but you cannot find it in the stores. I just gave one to my daughter she loved it but I don&#x27;t know where to tell her to buy them.</li>
    <li> I usually use the soft pick gum ones to get inbetween my bottom teeth with my permanent retainer, these things are so hard - it&#x27;s like straight plastic, I have them a 2 because they are good at getting any plaque that you have but really not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Decent but a bit harsh on the gums. Dnt think ill but this item again in the future but thats ok</li>
    <li> reasonably price with convenient container.  Fast delivery.  I would recommend the use of these brush picks. The brushes are easier to use on teeth with gaps</li>
    <li> Wife likes these a little more than I do, but I&#x27;d still give them 5 stars.  Not a substitute for flossing by any means, but a nice addition.</li>
    <li> Execellent picks. Its like having a small toothbrush. I keep them on hand all the time</li>
    <li> did very well in my teeth and work well to clean between them also</li>
    <li> Cleans in between teeth and does it faster and as well as dental floss. Good for use at home and ideal for travel.</li>
    <li> Good functioning, and design of pick.  A very good price, and good quality for the money.  Very pleased by service.</li>
    <li> Try these little guys, they are just perfect for rooting around between your teeth.  I used them exclusively for about 6 years.</li>
    <li> Always great to have on hand!</li>
    <li> These toothpicks are great for massaging gums, cleaning food particles out of large gaps in teeth, and gently picking food particles out of molars with nooks &amp; crannies. However, they aren&#x27;t ideal for removing stubborn pieces of broccoli or corn from teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These toothpicks are plastic and rather sharp. Even though wooden toothpicks are also hard, these plastic toothpicks have sharper edges and points and so you have to be a bit more careful. These toothpicks are also rather flexible so you don&#x27;t get the stiff leverage you sometimes need from a wooden toothpick to remove food from teeth. Lastly, the brushes on the end are a very cool feature and allow for massaging of the gums in between teeth, but you have to have enough room to slide the brush in an out (unless you have enough of a gap to use thick dental tape, you probably won&#x27;t be comfortable shoving the brushes in and out without causing your gums to bleed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and these are good to have around the house. But I will still keep standard wood toothpicks in my car for quick removal of stubborn food.</li>
    <li> These are a great balance of not too hard/not too soft. I&#x27;ve had ones where the bristles cut into your gums. And others where they are just there for show. These bristles have enough strength to &amp;#34;coax&amp;#34; food out but without coaxing out bits of your gum along with it. They are getting harder to find.</li>
    <li> I love these brush picks.  I&#x27;ve tried other similar products, but these are the best of all I&#x27;ve tried.  I was very glad to find them online because none of my local stores carry them any longer.</li>
    <li> I have braces. I hate flossing. Braces made flossing exceedingly difficult. I highly recommend these for anyone, braces or not. Because of overcrowding, I had some hard buildup between two teeth. When my braces started to correct my teeth, it broke that buildup into two, but it still stayed on my teeth. So I used the pick side of these to sand it off. It worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a smell coming from in between two molars. After using these for a week or two I was able to completely eradicate that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were a dream come true.</li>
    <li> What kind of rave review can you give little plastic brush-picks? They are as described, small white toothpicks with one end fashioned as a brush that looks exactly like the leaf pattern of a moth’s antennae (if you don’t know what that looks like, web search an image). I had previously used picks whose ends had little spikes all around the circumference and these were a bit sturdier than the picks here. The “leaf” pick is flat and feels a bit flimsy (especially when compared to the picks I previously used), but it works just fine as does the regular pick end. These are a great price for the quantity and I use them several times a day. I do recommend them.</li>
    <li> The perfect all around toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;Eliminates flossing</li>
    <li> This is a new way of flossing and it is definitely more gentle that flossing.  Sometimes though it is just not enough.</li>
    <li> Never could floss, but with these babies my gums and teeth are looking better than ever.  Brush your teeth, then use these and see just how much stuff brushing never touches!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was using another brand that was a little bigger in diameter and could not fit between my teeth.  This one is perfect. Just be careful to get used to it.  I poked my gum the first time. My own fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These picks work very well. My dentist is pleased with the results. Can&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
    <li> I tried these because they are so much cheaper than the brand I normally use (GUM soft-picks), but I had to throw these brushpicks away. They were too big for many of the gaps between my teeth, but the biggest problem was how sharp and bristly they were. It actually hurt to use them!</li>
    <li> I always keep a pack in the car.  My wife keeps one in her purse.  Great for cleaning between teeth when away from home.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product especially for people with any degree of periodontal disease. And they probably won&#x27;t want to be without these once they&#x27;ve tried them. They are far superior at removing food caught between teeth than any other tooth pick I&#x27;ve ever used. And if you have any degree of space between your teeth they&#x27;re even more effective than floss. I&#x27;ve been using them for years and will continue to as long as I have teeth, which, by the way are in better shape now than when I started using these picks.</li>
    <li> These Doctor&#x27;s brushpicks are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a start, you can remove more plaque with a good brush pick than you can with floss, and it can help reach areas that floss cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these Doctor&#x27;s brushpicks are better than most others. The material they are made of is strong. It will not break in your mouth or fold with minor pressure. It&#x27;s easy to grip, and holds up to the intended usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picks themselves are shaped in a fashion to maximize the removal of plaque. Even in hard to reach spaces, these work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the value of these are great, as is the dispenser, which is convenient and prevents your picks from being exposed to open air contaminants (like dust buildup) prior to usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you need flosspicks, you need the Doctor&#x27;s brand!</li>
    <li> Your gums will bleed at first, but after the first few times using them, it should stop. Great for teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these.  I bought the refill because I originally bought a pack of....I think it was 4...of the key chain holders for them.  Now I have toothpicks with me all the time.  They are SO much better than regular toothpicks because of the little brush on one end and a regular pick on the other end.  I gave two to my friends and keep one on my key chain and another close by.  These are now the only toothpicks I use.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Why are you not in the stores anymore? Please don&#x27;t stop making them.  This is truly a good product. should be used by all</li>
    <li> A good product, a good seller, a good price. Sorry for the abbreviated review, but it annoys me that Amazon compels reviews to be so long. If I have anything important to add, I will. Otherwise, it’s hard to expand on the virtues of a USB cable, paper towels or socks.</li>
    <li> Forget the toothpicks; these are that and more. The sharp end is tapered to fit in a lot of spaces. But the brush end is what makes these stand out, picking up bits that toothpick&#x27;s miss. If you have braces or spaces in you teeth that trap food, get these.</li>
    <li> i also bought the smaller pack ones to carry around, but i bought these to keep at home. Guests are always impressed at the &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34; toothpicks we have!</li>
    <li> Brush end sligtly delicate and prone to bending. Overall a great buy. m m m m m m m m m</li>
    <li> If there are gaps between your teeth, as there are mine, buy these and garner applause from your dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered these because he loves the ones he&#x27;s been using for years (same brand).  When he received them, he noticed the design had changed, and doesn&#x27;t like them, so they were returned.</li>
    <li> These picks get into the smallest gaps between your teeth with the brush end. I still floss but it doesn&#x27;t usually find any leftovers. I love them.</li>
    <li> I could no longer find these in local stores, so I tried Amazon... and, as usual, they had them.  These picks are great, and the tips will not break off!</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed!  I use it after each meal and it really makes a difference.  Unlike anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
    <li> not a fan of picking my teeth but wanted to try it...</li>
    <li> This was a great deal for a multipack and I love using Doctors Brushpicks to keep my teeth and gums clean. The product arrived on time and packaged securely. This item is great for dental enthusiast wanting good quality dental products.</li>
    <li> fairly sturdy, especially considering how thin they are. I really like these.</li>
    <li> I tried these after the dentist found some #5 &amp; #6 pockets &amp; had to go through scaling.  The bristles were a bit stiff and hard to use after the scaling procedure.  I wouldn&#x27;t put it in vertically, as it appears you should.  Best put in horizontally so the bristles bend.  After it was totally healed, I find these great for getting between tooth and gums.  I&#x27;m not quite sure what the other end is good for.  I haven&#x27;t found a good use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a box in my purse, car and at home..</li>
    <li> Face it: you can copiously brush and floss and still have decaying food particles between teeth and in gum recesses. These picks finish the job. I even keep some at work for an after-lunch touch up. The little brushes are slim enough that the don&#x27;t get stuck, even between crowded teeth. My family started stealing mine so I keep plenty on hand!</li>
    <li> these are great.  They keep my gums clear of food! Bababooey!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brush picks for years and have been having difficulty finding them in the brick and mortar stores recently.  The largest packages I had previously found were a dual pack of about 120+ picks.  Buying them here was so much cheaper.  I had to phone to verify how many packages were included as the description wasn&#x27;t very clear.  (I think Amazon has clarified there are 4 packages of 275 per pack.)  I now should have a two-year supply at least!  Also, I saved one of my old dispenser packages (which held about 60-75) and use it in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a plus, the sturdiness of the plastic makes it ideal to use when you need a small, pointed cleaner for general cleaning (not dental) uses - like between computer keys.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Great price.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;toothpicks&amp;#34; are the best!!  a good replacement for flossing and a good way to clean your teeth between brushings.</li>
    <li> Did not like these picks at all. They&#x27;re a very hard plastic and made my gums bleed when used. The soft rubber GUM picks are ten times better. These picks flatly were a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I buy this to give to overseas friends as a gift and it is most popular!</li>
    <li> Best product ever for the teeth. I totally reversed a gum condition by using these after all eating. My dental hygienist never saw anything like the improvement in my exam numbers.</li>
    <li> Best toothpick there is at a great price.</li>
    <li> It is convenient.  One end of it is used as toothpick and the other soft end for flossing.  Good quality, and price is reasonable.  One pack of 4 can last a long time.  Other than brushing my teeth morning and night, I use Brush Picks right after every meal to make sure no food bits are left between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Quality of picks is worse than the ones one can buy in the CVS Pharmacy, they bend. The label on the case was different  from the ones I usually buy in the pharmacy too.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely not buy these again through amazon and stick to the ones from CVS, Walmart etc. Although they are a little more expensive than the ones sold here they at least work.</li>
    <li> They are exactly what I wanted. And they were shipped in a reasonable time thanks.</li>
    <li> I hate using floss.  It always breaks off in between my teeth and becomes a nightmare to remove it.  I didn&#x27;t think looking at this that the brush would fit in between my teeth but I was amazed at how easily it cleans in between teeth.  I use them every day now.  Use it once and throw it away because the brush won&#x27;t last two times.</li>
    <li> Absolutely indispensable product.</li>
    <li> I bought a few packages as gifts for my friends, they never knew about how good they were, they love it.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. A four pack will take care of my teeth for the next two years.</li>
    <li> Great to have in the car after leaving a restaurant and you need to get rid of that last piece of bothersome food stuck deep in your teeth.  This actually scrubs between the teeth and gums when you use the bristled end.  The regular &amp;#34;toothpick&amp;#34; end does what it&#x27;s intended to do and since the whole thing is plastic it doesn&#x27;t wear after going between just a few teeth.  One pack was plenty to last a while but the deal on 4 was good enough to buy and have them for a while without having to repurchase.</li>
    <li> After years of neglect I have been diagnosed with gum disease. I had a root scaling and planing and continued with my bad habits thinking that the problem will disappear. Later I was told I should have gum flap surgery. All four quarters. Scheduled the very next week. 12mm pockets. $5,000. Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went home and started researching the disease and treatment options. As a result I canceled that idiotic surgery, decided to drastically change my oral hygiene, had another root scaling and planing, and made an appointment for a LANAP procedure. My routine included now brushing (with a [[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]], every time with a different all-natural fluoride-free toothpaste - I&#x27;ve tried several brands and settled on 5-6 of them), flossing, using an oral irrigator (a [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] initially and then a [[ASIN:B0027LSEPS Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A]] - very often with a distilled water / hydrogen peroxide mix), chewing xylitol gum (again, tried several brand and settled on Epic like this one but I buy in bulk from their website - [[ASIN:B006609MBG Epic Dental 100% Xylitol Sweetened Gum, Peppermint, 12 Count (Pack of 12)]]), replacing all sugar with xylitol, etc. etc. and of course, using Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the above I used religiously after every single meal. I became almost obsessed with the hygiene to the point that I would avoid snacking if I knew I couldn&#x27;t clean my teeth afterwards. But it all paid off! Within a few months I went for my LANAP evaluation and was told that there is no need for a full scale procedure anymore, only localized for one single deep pocket. Imagine that! Now it&#x27;s 3 years later and I am free of any gum disease, and all my pockets are 3mm now. I still continue to employ most of the above techniques, and these brushpicks are an integral part of my ritual, as they are absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people compare the brushpicks with flossing. I believe this is a flawed comparison, and in my opinion the two complement each other. I use the brushpicks to clean at the base of my teeth, gently brushing underneath the tip of my gums (I am using them at an angle and move them back and forth and as much as I can around each tooth). This is far superior in removing food debris from that area - in fact flossing will not remove much from under the gums, while the brushpicks will remove almost everything. However, these brushpicks have limited efficacy when removing debris from in between the teeth, especially towards the tip, and this is where flossing has an advantage (you could use the brushpick tip but I found that to be too limited as they are ribbed and not really strong, which limits their cleaning capacity). Using these two alongside yields great results though! BUT, if I would have to choose between the two, I would go with the brushpicks without any hesitation, as they are much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all is great though, as the quality varies, even within the same pack - some are too soft and don&#x27;t pick up much, and some are so sturdy that will hurt my gums. As such, sometimes I go through a few of them just to get to the \\&quot;good\\&quot; one that feels just right. Hence the four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after 3 years of using them I am addicted! I literally cannot leave my house without them (there are some nice toothpick holders, but I just carry the smaller pack with me). If I forget them at home, I will either go back and get them or stop at a pharmacy and buy a new pack. I have a few packs at home at all times, and I even subscribed to automatic delivery. I never snack unless I have these on me. I know it sounds a little over the board, but they are indeed the best picks you&#x27;ll ever use. There is absolutely no comparison to the wooden ones (those have some beneficial properties though, especially the ones with tea tree oil) or anything else (portable that is). And if you are like me and cannot stand anything in your teeth and you&#x27;ll fracture your tongue just to get it out and cannot function until that \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; is out, you&#x27;ll appreciate the nimbleness of these brushpicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually gave a few to some friends from overseas when visiting and guess what, now I have to ship them a few boxes every now and then... I even have requests from their friends as well... Pretty soon I&#x27;ll be exporting them in bulk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a highly recommended item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Forgot to mention - When diagnosed with the gum disease, I was also told  I need to have my wisdom teeth extracted due to deep pockets and inability to clean properly. Guess what, not anymore! These brushpicks are absolutely perfect for cleaning those spaces, you know, where you usually brake your fingers and cheeks trying to get that pesky floss in there...e like me and cannot stand anything in your teeth and you&#x27;ll fracture your tongue just to get it out and cannot function until that \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; is out, you&#x27;ll appreciate the nimbleness of these brushpicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually gave a few to some friends from overseas when visiting and guess what, now I have to ship them a few boxes every now and then...

    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1372BVBMXL2TS]]This particular container (275-count) was a challenge to open because it was difficult to make out the arrows and/or other \\&quot;directions\\&quot; on the clear plastic container top. I finally got it though, and after a few weeks even figured out the best way to get a pick out. This video demonstrates both. (Hint: Don&#x27;t shake down, shake UP!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these these brushpicks to other flossing-type tools because the pick end is small and tapered enough to get completely between my teeth at the gumline and slightly above, unlike the pick end of many of the sword-shaped one-hand flossers. However when I use the brush end, some of the brushes seem likely to break off and are left in my mouth or between my teeth and it is often hard to remove them. Hence I limit the use of the brush end. When I do use it, I&#x27;m careful not to twist it too much in tight spaces.</li>
    <li> I like this very much. Use it after every meal/snack. It is very flexible, can reach the back teeth. It hurts a little bit.</li>
    <li> Since using this product, my gums are healthier and my teeth cleaner.  My dentist is very impressed and so am I.</li>
    <li> I use 4 of these a day. Chew on them all day long. They really clean between the teeth. My Dentist comments on how clean my teeth are.</li>
    <li> This product works well, easy to use and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;am sure that my next dental check up will prove that this product works.</li>
    <li> My dentist&#x27;s office put me on to these, and they are great.  You can carry some with you for those annoying times that something gets between your teeth.  One end has a minibrush which does a great job in small spaces.  This particular brand is the best.  I have tried the pink brand but these work better.</li>
    <li> The best tooth pick ever. I&#x27;ve used wood and other plastic picks; this produce it the only one that&#x27;s comfortable and works. The flexible tip is capable of squeezing in where no other pick can.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these for cleaning food from between teeth. When floss pushes it down, this pulls it out.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering these for 5 years and love them. My husband is the toothpicker and these work great.</li>
    <li> Before and after braces.  Love these.</li>
    <li> All this product does is make me bleed.  Get the G.U.M. Soft Picks instead.  They&#x27;re a bit more expensive but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Starting having gum issues after turning 40. No more gum issues. Dentist impressed with the health of my gums.</li>
    <li> buy it for my mother and me, she loves them, cleans real well those hard to get crumbs off your teeth</li>
    <li> Cleans way better than floss</li>
    <li> Great way to improve dental hygene especially if you have bridgework. Easily cleans between teeth and under bridges. Faster than flossing.</li>
    <li> Great little brushes and a good price.</li>
    <li> The best picks I have ever used. They really do the job and my teeth and gums are in much better shape!</li>
    <li> I have 1 Bridge, and the rest of my teeth are my own.  I have a very tiny mouth (husband doesn&#x27;t agree), which requires the Dentist to use Children&#x27;s apparatus&#x27; when doing any work.&lt;br /&gt;Using floss for my Bridge, even with the &#x27;loop&#x27;,&#x27; doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to see the GUM brushes on Amazon, and love them.  However, there were more picks in the Doctor&#x27;s, so I ordered them.....and DO NOT LIKE THEM AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;They are harsh on your gums, your lips, and I worry they might damage the enamel on my teeth. .&lt;br /&gt;Too late to send them back, so I&#x27;ll use them for cleaning or crafts.&lt;br /&gt;From now on, its GUM soft brush picks for me.&lt;br /&gt;Maggie Stalhut</li>
    <li> These have worked well for me--improved my dental health--great to get a big package like the Amazon size.</li>
