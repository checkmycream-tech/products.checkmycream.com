      <li>That bit I warm up in a ceramic dish inside a wax warmer</li>

      <li>tips for making it easier and more convenient:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried another two minutes followed by two and two more.  </li>
      <li>I have a regular candle warmer that does the job perfectly.</li>

      <li>I have one more sentence to add....</li>

      <li>The more hair there is, the thicker you have to put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t inhibit the wax&#x27;s job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using zip wax for many years.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years</li>
      <li>This is the best personal waxing product I have ever found and have been using it for many years.  </li>
      <li>Of all the hair removal supplies I&#x27;ve tried, this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t ever change :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it here-</li>
      <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
      <li>I have been using that product for year and just love it.  </li>
      <li>i was concerned though because i read many of the reviews and</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best hot wax-</li>
      <li>I was always excited to see \\&quot;easier\\&quot; or \\&quot;more advanced\\&quot; products hit the market over the years, but all have NEVER given the results that this product does.</li>
      <li>I recommed it over all other hair removal products for providing the best results.  </li>
      <li>It worked fine</li>
      <li>Fabulous product.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and was so happy to find it on Amazon as it is not in local stores.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll never get it clean again.</li>
      <li>It is true that you have to provide your own container for melting the wax, but I have always just used a cheap pie tin placed over an old pot in which the water boils.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They have special heaters you can buy to heat this up, but I just use a glass cup and put that into a boiling pot of water.</li>
      <li>I have recently not been able to find this product in the stores in my neighborhood, so am glad it is available on line.</li>
      <li>I was nervous that Zip had taken the product off of the market, so I was tremendously relieved to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I put a paper towel over the wax, as soon as I put it on the skin, to make it easier to pull the wax off quickly.  </li>
      <li>It is very hard to find this in stores, so was very happy to find it at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Once you have used it a few times, your skin will adjust and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>That being said, this wax removes hair so much better than the soft waxes I have tried.</li>
      <li>Well, i am happy to say that i used the new product that i received from Amazon and it works just as good as it always has in the past - actually</li>
      <li>I JUST LOVE THE ZIP HOT WAX PRODUCT,  I LIVE IN NEW YORK</li>
      <li>At that time you could find this in the stores, but now I&#x27;ve only been able to buy this online.  </li>
      <li>I tried two more times and still had the same results.</li>
      <li>I have used Zip Wax for years, and was no longer able to find it locally.</li>
      <li>It will hurt the first time you use it IF you have alot of hair to remove.</li>
      <li>I have been using this hot wax for years.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and very effecient and not messy</li>
      <li>I started using Zip hot wax way back when I was in high school, now (ahem) more than 25 years ago.</li>
      <li>I bought this based on the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>it removed all of my hair easily and in one application (facial on the chin and mustache area)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s ready when it&#x27;s time for my shower, etc.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>but nowadays this is the last one available.</li>
      <li>THANKS AGAIN FRAN B</li>
      <li>It melts the wax very well.</li>
      <li>AND I COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT ANYWHERE, THANKS TO AMAZON.COM.  </li>
      <li>Much easier to order on-line.</li>
      <li>This used to be one of the only ones available</li>
      <li>It takes a while, sometimes as much as 2 hours depending on how much wax is in there.</li>
      <li>When it arrived i noticed that the wax blocks were much lighter in color</li>
      <li>The real ZIP product.</li>
      <li>If you use it 2-3 times per month, its almost painless as there isn&#x27;t much hair to remove.</li>
      <li>When I stirred it I noticed it was very grainy like someone added baby powder to it.  </li>
      <li>I just put it into an old microwave safe ramekin and leave the product in it for all future use.</li>
      <li>i will definitely be buying it again and am ecstatic that i don&#x27;t have to look for something else - in 25 years this is the ONLY product that has ever been effective - and</li>
      <li>i can now have it delivered directly to my house with the use of Amazon!!!  </li>
      <li>Update, ordered it again and it is back to the original formula.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that it did not hurt as much as I thought it would!</li>
      <li>I reuse the same hunk of wax, so the price of the wax is not bad considering.</li>
      <li>Now, I have to find a decent substitute.</li>
      <li>AND my skin felt softer after removal (which never used to be the case with the older version.)  </li>

    <li> I have been using this product for years great product</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and I have always liked it.  it works well, melts good etc.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using Zip for over 25 years and have always loved this product.  The neighborhood pharmacy which ordered it for me over the last several years closed and i was relieved and delighted to see that i could order it directly on Amazon.  i was concerned though because i read many of the reviews and alot of them said that the product had changed (was grainy, didn&#x27;t remove the hair, etc. etc.)  i ordered two boxes and crossed my fingers.  When it arrived i noticed that the wax blocks were much lighter in color so i saved what i had left in my last box  (just in case the bad reviews were right....i didn&#x27;t want to be stuck without something to use while i found an alternative!)  Well, i am happy to say that i used the new product that i received from Amazon and it works just as good as it always has in the past - actually, it&#x27;s better!  it removed all of my hair easily and in one application (facial on the chin and mustache area) AND my skin felt softer after removal (which never used to be the case with the older version.)  i will definitely be buying it again and am ecstatic that i don&#x27;t have to look for something else - in 25 years this is the ONLY product that has ever been effective - and icing on the cake....i can now have it delivered directly to my house with the use of Amazon!!!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using this wax for about 30 years, wow that seems long , where does time go? LOL This used to be one of the only ones available but nowadays this is the last one available. I have wasted time, money and effort on others but don&#x27;t be fooled, this is the only one which picks up all the hairs. I do not own a microwave because I feel it is unhealthy so I take an empty soup can and use that with a small cheap boiler pot, (it is also best if you use a can opener that takes the lid off so you do not have sharp edges) from a 99 cent store and use that as a double boiler, works well !</li>
    <li> This is a hard block of wax that you will have to melt in your own container. I don&#x27;t think you can put this in a microwave. I use the double boiler method with 2 small old saucepans. Can&#x27;t use direct heat.That being said, this wax removes hair so much better than the soft waxes I have tried. It goes on thicker and removes all of the hair. It will hurt the first time you use it IF you have alot of hair to remove. Once you have used it a few times, your skin will adjust and it&#x27;s great. If you use it 2-3 times per month, its almost painless as there isn&#x27;t much hair to remove. You can also reuse the wax. Just throw it back in the pot. I use it for facial hair only so I buy a new block about every 2-3 years. This product may be a little inconvenient to melt but it works great, hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> Of all the hair removal supplies I&#x27;ve tried, this is my favorite. Yeah, waxing hurts a bit. But if you do it right, the pain is basically like rubbing bare feet really hard on a carpeted floor; no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips for making it easier and more convenient:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I do not use a double-boiler. I use a thick glass candle holder. Break off a hunk from the bar and throw it on in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I do not use the stove or microwave. I have a regular candle warmer that does the job perfectly. It takes a while, sometimes as much as 2 hours depending on how much wax is in there. But it&#x27;s the type of thing where I can turn it on in the late afternoon and it&#x27;s ready when it&#x27;s time for my shower, etc. The reason I prefer this method is because you just turn the warmer on and forget about it. You don&#x27;t have to watch over it, and there&#x27;s little mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If you don&#x27;t mind having little pieces of hair in your wax, REUSE it. I bought this 7oz bar back in June and have only used 1/4 of it. The more hair there is, the thicker you have to put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t inhibit the wax&#x27;s job. When it starts to do so, stop reusing it. Throw it out and put new wax in your warmer.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Works perfectly.  Just make sure you let dry totally before you pull it off.  SAVES ME TONS OF MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> product  arrived  very quickly in good condition    difficult to melt, but it does the trick</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find this in stores, so was very happy to find it at Amazon.  Have used it for years.  A good product</li>
    <li> I have been using this hot wax for years.  Works very well. Almost impossible to find in the store.  Much easier to order on-line.</li>
    <li> I started using Zip hot wax way back when I was in high school, now (ahem) more than 25 years ago. I was always excited to see \\&quot;easier\\&quot; or \\&quot;more advanced\\&quot; products hit the market over the years, but all have NEVER given the results that this product does. The soft lukewarm wax once tore off half the skin on my upper lip (an embarrassing, excruciatingly painful, and hideous mess). Others simply don&#x27;t grab the hair at all and I end up plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY wax I will ever use for hair removal. I&#x27;ve since gotten laser hair removal for most of my &#x27;problem&#x27; areas, but still use Zip for my eyebrows. As long as you ensure the wax is cooled enough, you can&#x27;t injure yourself with this product. Additionally, I have melted this in the microwave for years. I just put it into an old microwave safe ramekin and leave the product in it for all future use. My only other tip is to make sure you use enough to provide a relatively thick coat of wax. If you apply it too thinly, it will break as you are trying to remove it, and will get stuck in the hairs. If that happens, don&#x27;t worry - just put another coat over the pieces and pull as once piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely, my local stores and pharmacies stopped carrying this hot wax, and I can&#x27;t understand why. I was nervous that Zip had taken the product off of the market, so I was tremendously relieved to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used Zip Wax for years, and was no longer able to find it locally. I was very happy to find it here. Best hair removal product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have been using Zip wax for three decades, but I&#x27;d started having trouble finding it in local stores.  So I tried several other brands, and none of them compared to Zip.  Some of the waxes remained sticky, and removing it from my skin was a nightmare.  Plus, none of the other products removed all the hair, which Zip does.  Thank goodness I was able to find Zip on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. Works wonders. Doesn&#x27;t break nicely into the little squares, but I managed to break it in half. Then I microwaved one half until it was soft enough for me to cut off a small bit. That bit I warm up in a ceramic dish inside a wax warmer [[ASIN:B000I40CXI Gigi Warmer Economy #225]] . I reuse the same hunk of wax, so the price of the wax is not bad considering. Good for anywhere on the body, including face, legs, etc.</li>
    <li> I started on my legs but found it messy so I just did smaller areas instead. It works well but found it does not remove the shorter hair. I was surprised that it did not hurt as much as I thought it would! TO MAKE IT NOT HURT PULL THE SKIN TIGHT BEFORE REMOVING THE WAX.  I put a paper towel over the wax, as soon as I put it on the skin, to make it easier to pull the wax off quickly.  It worked fine but then you can&#x27;t reuse that wax.  I also tried it with just the wax and that works fine too, as long as you put it on thick enough.  I liked it and I hope this review helps you with the process!</li>
    <li> Maybe I should have bought a smaller package. The 7 oz block is too big for my at home wax warmer, and it&#x27;s impossible to just &#x27;break off a chunk&#x27; like other reviewers say. Removes most of the hair, but whatever brand of wax came with my unit worked better, but I didn&#x27;t save the packaging to know what that was. Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s average.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and was so happy to find it on Amazon as it is not in local stores.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years</li>
    <li> I have used this wax for about 30+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do microwave it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in a corning ware dish and&lt;br /&gt;microwave for 2 minutes!!! It&#x27;s PERFECT!!!</li>
    <li> Using this wax for 30 yrs and love it! Saves alot of money on waxing And trips to the salon</li>
    <li> I have use Zip for years.  I ordered it again and it is lighter in color and it has a grainy texture.  It does not remove hair like the old wax. I bought it from Drugstore.com.  Used them before with no issues. Both shipments - two different sizes have this new formula that is terrible!!</li>
    <li> Zip hot wax is the only product I have found that will remove all the hair from legs, bikini area, underarms, etc., and hair growth is diminished.  I do not know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> This product removes unwanted hair completely.  I recommed it over all other hair removal products for providing the best results.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> This is the best wax around.  It gets harder so it&#x27;s less messy and you can melt it in the microwave.  The only drawback is finding a container to melt it in since once this stuff melts and then dries in it you&#x27;ll never get it clean again.</li>
    <li> I JUST LOVE THE ZIP HOT WAX PRODUCT,  I LIVE IN NEW YORK AND I COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT ANYWHERE, THANKS TO AMAZON.COM.  I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS, IT SAVES ME THE TIME DOING IT AT HOME INSTEAD OF GOING TO A SALON,AND THE PRODUCT LASTS A LONG TIME.  I&#x27;M SO GLAD THAT THIS PRODUCT IS STILL ON THE MARKET.  THANKS AGAIN FRAN B</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years since I have little time to go to a salon for waxing, and this is so much less expensive. It is true that you have to provide your own container for melting the wax, but I have always just used a cheap pie tin placed over an old pot in which the water boils. It is a ritual that is so easy, and I like the fact that because it is a hard wax, you don&#x27;t have to use papers...or get messy sticky strings of honey-like wax all over the place. I have recently not been able to find this product in the stores in my neighborhood, so am glad it is available on line. I highly reccommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best personal waxing product I have ever found and have been using it for many years.  Don&#x27;t ever change :)</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews. I really wanted it to work, but it did a very poor job. I followed the instructions carefully and took my time. The wax only removed a couple of hairs and then crumbled off. I tried two more times and still had the same results. It hurt a lot and gave me a bunch of little red bumps.</li>
    <li> Was very happy to get this product.  It melts well and is a very good product.  The real ZIP product.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for years.  Does the best job of any product I&#x27;ve used for getting rid of those unsightly chin hairs that plague us older ladies. (Sure beats plucking!) You will need a very small old pan to heat it up,  No papers needed.  Do be careful because it gets HOT when melting.  Let it sit for a few minutes till it just starts to harden back up but still warm.  Product should not be runny when applying. Do small areas at a time and remove with a quick jerk . . . VOILA!  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
    <li> I have used this product over the years but it is no longer stocked at Walmart or at Walgreen&#x27;s.  I found it on Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is excellent and can be used over and over.  It is gentle on the skin and does not require messy strips.  The hair is pulled out by the root and it leaves your skin very smooth.  I also do not require medicated lotions after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No messy residue is left on skin.</li>
    <li> i have been waxing over 30 years and have been very pleased with zip wax- i stocked up when i found it harder to find. using a thin layer of baby powder on  area to be waxed helps wax not stick to skin. using a thicker layer and a bit thicker where you start pulling up should eliminate the crackly bits. also hair has to be long enough for wax to grab so if too short might not come up- i use an old can to heat mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for around 30 years.  I wax approximately every 3-4 weeks and reuse it.  I purchase 2-3 boxes at a time several times a year.  It&#x27;s been an awesome product until this morning.  I heated a new block and after my usual 4 minutes I noticed it wasn&#x27;t even close to melted.  I tried another two minutes followed by two and two more.  When I stirred it I noticed it was very grainy like someone added baby powder to it.  Forging ahead I did my upper lip and after my customary 15-20 seconds wait time I went to pull it off and it was tearing loose in little grainy bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an hour of fighting with the product on my face and bikini (it usually takes me about 20 minutes to do it all), I looked at the boxes ingredients and noticed they added calcium carbonate.  That&#x27;s like grounding up a Tums antacid and throwing it into the wax.  What were they thinking?  I just purchased another box so I looked at the ingredients on that one.  Rosin, beeswax, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They ruined an excellent product that i would have purchased forever.  Now, I have to find a decent substitute.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using zip wax for many years. It was the best product, but they had to go and change the formula. It is just awful. I have one more sentence to add....CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!</li>
    <li> This used to be great - I&#x27;ve ordered here and on drugstore.com somewhere along the line the product changed.  It&#x27;s gritty, doesn&#x27;t not seem to melt completely and does not remove the hair.  I will be trying to find another product asap.</li>
    <li> I have been using that product for year and just love it.  Easy to use and very effecient and not messy</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product online ever since they stopped carrying it in the stores. This is the first batch that I&#x27;ve bought that was bad. The wax does not melt properly and is milky in color. I&#x27;m assuming that the cause is that it is very old.</li>
    <li> I had just purchased the lastest box and they changed it. They added something to it and now it no longer works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need to removed the added items which changed the way the wax works. IT IS NOT JUNK!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hot wax- I have been using it forever!  I&#x27;m so glad I found it here- it is difficult to find.</li>
    <li> Used this for years and loved. They changed it and now it is just a grainy mess that went into the trash. Change it back please. Update, ordered it again and it is back to the original formula. I love it.</li>
    <li> This wax rocks. The woman I used to go to to get waxed (eyebrows, upper lip, bikini line and upper leg) recommended this to me when I went to college out of state over 10 years ago so I could do it myself.  At that time you could find this in the stores, but now I&#x27;ve only been able to buy this online.  Nothing works like this, and I&#x27;ve tried a few other products.  This product allows you to rip the wax off your face without any paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have special heaters you can buy to heat this up, but I just use a glass cup and put that into a boiling pot of water. In college I used a hotpot, which probably worked better.  Careful - the glass gets hot so you&#x27;ll need something to hold it!</li>
    <li> Zip Wax in the block form has changed its formula and now it is just awful.  I have used Zip Wax for over 30 years.  How do we complain or suggest to the manufacturer?  I see it is distributed by Lee Pharmaceuticals in S. El Monte, California.  No phone number but might be a start.  So disappointed!  Does anyone have a contact number for Zip Wax source?  Plus I want my wooden spatula back and not this new plastic one!</li>
    <li> This product has been around for a very long time and I&#x27;ve used it for many, many years. I put it in an egg poacher style double boiler, fill it with water, and put the stove on simmer. It melts the wax very well. It does a great job for shaping eyebrows. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
