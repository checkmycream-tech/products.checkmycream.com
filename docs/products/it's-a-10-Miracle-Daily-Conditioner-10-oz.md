<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love love love the product, but the pump has broken already the product does not come out of the end of the nozzle it comes out where the pump slides in.would someone from the company please contact me so I can get a replacement?</li>
    <li> I have only bought this once before but will continue to buy it. I like how it has worked better than most conditioners I have previously used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, did not really see a big difference. It was recommended by hairdresser. Good price here though.</li>
    <li> Conditioner works well. It&#x27;s not AMAZING. I wasn&#x27;t able to get the shampoo to go with it so that may affect my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best product ever. It immediately leaves your hair manageable and it will hold the style.  it is great especially if you want to preserve curls. Amazing you will not regret buying this product, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I trully really enjoying the it&#x27;s a miracle conditioner. It is the best conditioner I have ever used. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought It&#x27;s A 10 because I just put ombr&amp;eacute; in my hair and noticed my ends were really dry and weak. Before I had It&#x27;s A 10 I was using the Ovation Cell Therapy Hair Treatment. Ovation Cell Therapy worked great to help my hair grow faster and thicker but did not do as great of a job of hydrating and strengthening my ends, the original reason I had purchased It&#x27;s A 10. I haven&#x27;t noticed if the product does the remaining of the things it says it will do: detangles, imparts softness (I&#x27;m still using the conditioner that comes with the hair color),  preserves hair color, UV protection, restores shine, and thermal styling protection. Maybe it&#x27;s still too early for me to tell if It&#x27;s A 10 does these things but other than that I am happy with the product because it hydrates and strengthens my ends</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite conditioner.  It smells great, it works great, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and I love the convenient pump bottle.  The whole It&#x27;s A 10 product line has been a big winner in my book.  I have a hard time finding it in stock locally, but with my Prime subscription it&#x27;s no problem.  Better pricing, too.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product that works instantly to calm dry frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutley love this stuff!!!!  you will be shocked at how well it works!</li>
    <li> Works really great for tangles. Make sure to use the leave in as well to get best results!</li>
    <li> Got it for someone else, she loves this stuff, says this was a super great price for the amount.</li>
    <li> This is the first conditioner I&#x27;ve used that gave me noticeable results very quickly. My color-treated, flat-iron abused hair looks smoother, shinier and healthier. Make sure you order the leave-in conditioner because there is a rinse out version with similar packaging that isn&#x27;t nearly as effective.</li>
    <li> I ordered both the miracle hair mask and the miracle daily conditioner, thinking that I could use the conditioner on a daily basis and use the hair mask occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daily conditioner is not thick enough -- I have curly hair that gets frizzy quite easily.  The miracle hair mask (and a relatively small amount of it) works really well in my hair.  The daily conditioner does not -- it leaves it too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily hair maybe the daily conditioner will suffice -- but if you have dry hair or curly hair I recommend saving your money and using the money you would spend on the daily conditioner and spend it on the hair mask.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product, it had a funny smell kinda moldy and it was too sticky in my hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot--for those prone to frizzies, it is a huge help! It does help smooth and make hair look shinier and more sleek.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and a great deal for me.</li>
    <li> love this product it&#x27;s really helps my processed hair</li>
    <li> WATCH for OLD product! I bought back in late December and just opened (just ran out of my other) and this STINKS HORRIBLY due to OLD PRODUCT (either that or it&#x27;s FAKE). BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> This conditioner has been too softening for my hair - it makes my hair too soft and not able to hold a curl.  It&#x27;s wrong for hair that&#x27;s already fine and soft.</li>
    <li> I use this complete product line. Have tried several Salon brands but this is my favorite.Smells wonderful. Very rich and thick. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> BEST conditioner EVER!</li>
    <li> smells good and does wonders for over processed and flat hair.  use everyday and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy or grimy.  would def recommend for dry or brittle hair</li>
    <li> My hair is thin, which means conditioner weighs it down and makes it look even thinner....until now.  Wow!  This stuff makes it look and feel thicker, gets the tangles out, and makes it easier to manage. This may not be a heavy enough conditioner for you lucky girls with thick curly hair, but it works great for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner when matched with the spray on 10 miracle conditioner. It&#x27;s pricey but well worth the money.  Your hair will style beautifully!  Give it a try, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I use It&#x27;s A 10 everyday in my hair. I will definitely purchase it again because it is a must have in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> Love it! It works wanders with my hair.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but it&#x27;s really the same as the other shampoos/conditioners out there.  I noticed no difference in my hair quality.  After being satisfied with the \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; leave in treatment, I bought the rest of the product line.  If you&#x27;re going to drop some money on a good shampoo/conditioner, stick with Fekkai products.</li>
    <li> My daughter won&#x27;t use anything but this conditioner and shampoo. Amazon has the best price I could find anywhere. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Very nourishing for my hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years and love it. Really controls my hair...I have natural semi curly,fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love It&#x27;s a 10 products and was happy to see that Amazon carried them.  They work wonders and really make my hair smooth and manageable.  This is the conditioner and I actually meant to order the style lotion, but was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product! Good price. Arrived on time. No complaint.</li>
    <li> WORKS REALLY GOOD! IT MAKES YOUR HAIR SOFT! I LOVE IT SO MUCH! WOW......ITS GREAT!!!! ITS A 10,LOL!!!!!!! AWESOME!! AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a conditioner for a while now and I can finally say that my journey has come to an end - I LOVE &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Conditioner!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that is bleached and I also style it daily with a blow-dryer and flat iron. This conditioner has the perfect consistency, not too watered down and not too goopy. It feels great in the shower, leaving my hair very manageable! The end result is amazing because my hair feels soft and HEALTHIER after the first use and it only gets better, it doesn&#x27;t build-up or weigh my hair down. I would recommend this product to all hair types!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!!! Makes my hair shine and look so healthy. I have tried so many different products and none has given me the results that I get with 10 Miracle Conditioner!!!!</li>
    <li> great product for my hair!!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look and feel so healthy</li>
    <li> makes it easier to get a brush threw my long hair and helps keep my hair from becoming a frizzy mess</li>
    <li> I have had really bad static in my hair all winter.  I friend told me about this and sure enough this stops the static!  It is heavier then would I usually use but still pretty good.</li>
    <li> best in the park for hair.. like it say its a 10.. use this all the time...AAAAAA I use this all the time .. even the stars use this..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel my hair clening and have to used alot of shampoo</li>
    <li> This product reallly works!! My color damaged hair has taken a beating over the last year and I changed that with this product!! Yes the leave-in version works well too, but this daily conditioner smells wonderful and gives your hair immediate results!! I believe both products, daily conditioner AND leave-in conditioner work best together!! I also like the shampoo!!</li>
    <li> I actually ordered the wrong item. I wanted the leave it conditioner, which I ordered afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good, it makes your hair soft and shiny. The scent is ok, but I&#x27;d prefer something a bit more floral.</li>
    <li> I like this! Unlike the deep conditioner this one makes my hair feel less tangly - I have fine hair and need a leave in to safely&lt;br /&gt;comb through it after a shower..but I still use the leave in on my ends too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner since I blow dry or use hot rollers in my hair daily and all of the heat styling tends to dry my hair out. I tried using the Bed Head moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this product. I definitely recommend using the shampoo and conditioner (not just one or the other). They also make a leave in conditioner that I&#x27;ve been using for years and love!</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner ever.</li>
    <li> It smells really good. I secretly want to keep smelling my hair after using this conditioner. The only downside to it is that it isn&#x27;t as thick as some conditioners that I have used in the past. Actually, it is rather thin for a rinse out conditioner. With that being said, I have to use more of it with each wash.  However, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is not 10. I feel something else was put in these bottles. I think it is a cheap conditioner that was replaced. Not sure, but it&#x27;s not 10.</li>
    <li> My hair was fine before I used this conditioner. Now it&#x27;s dry and or greasy. What the?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with every product I have purchased from It&#x27;s A 10. Always makes my hair look shiny and fabulous.</li>
    <li> I Love this product- finally found the perfect product for my hair after a 5 year search. My hair feels so smooth and shiny and I am ready to show it for spring</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS OKAY... NOTHING SPECIAL. i HAVE USED FAR BETTER PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT WORK FAR BETTER. i LOVE THERE DETANGLER, SO I WAS EXPECTING THIS TO WORK GREAT TOO, BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T..</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with the shampoo because I thought it would be gentle, as the reviews led me to believe. However, my findings were very different. The scent is very strong and unpleasant and it wasn&#x27;t a good enough conditioner to undo the dryness the shampoo caused to my hair. I would not recommend these products.</li>
    <li> Great product. Hair feels soft &amp; manageable.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES this product. Claims that it works magic on her hair.</li>
    <li> I haveong hair and this product is a great leave in conditioner it helps with softeness and shine</li>
    <li> Hydrating but not heavy or greasy. Has a great smell and detangles well. My hair is baby fine and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for almost 3 weeks now. The product is very good and leave your hair very shiny and soft. Also, I realized that the hair is stronger now.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle. It tames the fly aways and makes your hair shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> This product is just great.leaves my hair soft for days.will continue to use it recommend it for all hair types.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews about it&#x27;s a 10 products, I decided to go with this one.  And I&#x27;m really surprise!....Really these products are &amp;#34;miracle products&amp;#34;.  My hair is thin, a little long, greasy, slightly frizzy sometimes ... all this make difficult to find products that really work in this type of hair. But this particular conditioner is really good.!!.  I had already tried the &amp;#34;leave-in keratin&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular is for the type of hair that is greasy. I must say that after shampooing, I did apply this conditioner and didn&#x27;t use any more for drying. My hair has gone completely soft, silky and shiny. There&#x27;s no other in the market that have made changed my hair in just A DAY. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great, just e careful not to put too much on, then it get yucky.</li>
    <li> Helps me brush my tangly hair out. Wish was cheaper?</li>
    <li> I use conditioner a lot so using this one daily is not harsh to my hair - makes my hair look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair nice and smooth - no tangles when combing wet - would buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> African American hair, thick....I can tell that it does supply additional moisture. Need to use it a bit longer.</li>
    <li> WOW! Awesome stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for good quality, cruelty free hair care products a couple of months ago. I found this at Ulta and wanted to try it, but the price they were asking for such a tiny bottle??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it here on Amazon at a price I&#x27;m willing to spend to try out a product with such great reviews. I use it after every shampoo. I bought this in conjunction with the Silk Hair Mask and my hair looks and feels so much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff it thick, so it doesn&#x27;t take much. That justifies the higher price! , To spray it through out my hair would waste a lot of product. Instead, I spray 3 pumps into my hand and then work it through out my hair and comb it through with a wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this in combination with the hair mask has done wonders for my hair. I ended up buying the shampoo and daily conditioner because this stuff is so awesome!</li>
    <li> The product is okay Still leave my hair a little frizzy.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair products on the market.  Love the smell and the great price on Amazon.  Wish I had ordered more!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hair dresser and I love it. I saw immediate improvement with my hair, it smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Maybe it does work, maybe not. I can&#x27;t tell. but it smells like urine and i&#x27;m not gonna use it.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair and need a good conditioner that does not weigh my hair down. Not sure I like this one, seems heavy and hard to completely rinse out compared to pureology and aveda. I do love the volume spray in product by 10 and my hair dresser uses that on my hair when I have it done, This is a good product line so I will wait and try again periodically to give it a good test. I just can not give it a high rating for my hair type.</li>
    <li> Love this as a daily conditioner. It is light, not too heavy, and smells wonderful. Would def recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This did not soften my hair at all.  It was just greasy and tangled  What a waste of money.....</li>
    <li> I got this by mistake.  I thought I ordered the leave in spray.  I was greatly disappointed when I received this instead of the spray...  But after using it, I was hooked!!!  I love this stuff!!!  Smells great AND works great!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! it&#x27;s magic. I bleached the heck out of my hair and it feels just as baby soft as my natural hair. Although i have cheaper &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; product that comes in a close second to this as favorite brand [Infusium. its a generic brand of paul mitchel. no animal testing], ITS A TEN wins. I would say its worth it every single time you find a sale, but dont waste your money on a small bottle. You&#x27;ll wonder why it disappeared. I definitely recommend this though... SO FIVE STARS FOR THE AWESOMENESS:D</li>
    <li> I love It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;ve always bought them from the Salon and the fragrance is awesome and the feel on the hair is soft and silky.  I decided to buy the product online this tiime becuase the salons are so far away, but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the Shampoo or Conditioner.  They had no smell or fragrance at all.  The product just smelled like plastic.  Also, the feel of it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  I kept adding more to my hair, but it had a slick, brassy feel, rather than a soft, smoothy silky feel.  I really believe that this isn&#x27;t even the same product.  I won&#x27;t buy online again!  I there&#x27;s a reason why brands will only guarantee their product if bought in a salon!</li>
    <li> I like this product in that it would work great for one with thin hair. My hair is thick so when using this conditioner along with the shampoo it makes my hair harder to work with. However the leave-in spray conditioner is wonderful and does well with shampooing alone.</li>
    <li> Great price for a good product!</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair which means I have a lot of frizz! I am always on the lookout to tame that frizz! It&#x27;s started with the It&#x27;s A Ten leave in conditioner with keratin and has migrated to the whole hair care line and I have never been happier. It is a tad more expensive than I like but well worth the money!!!! Never happier!</li>
    <li> I use a dab of this as a daily leave in conditioner.  Keeps my hair from getting frizzy.  I use about a dime size on long hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it!!! I&#x27;ve always had great hair until I did a stupid human trick by cutting it &amp; getting a straightening perm. It felt &amp; looked like straw afterwards. Thanks to all the reviews I read, I decided to try it. OMG! The 1st time I used it, I saw &amp; felt the difference. And it smells fabulous. I&#x27;ve tried many expensive products that didn&#x27;t come close to these results. And this is just from the conditioner. I ordered the set of shampoo, mask and leave-in, better deal. I&#x27;ll be trying those tomorrow. If it&#x27;s anything like this conditioner, I&#x27;m in heaven!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! She loves It&#x27;s a 10 products with a passion! It leaves her hair feeling nice and silky which makes her happy!</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect amount of conditioning without the heavy feel</li>
    <li> This product really fixes bad hair.  I would&#x27;t have believed it if my hairdresser hadn&#x27;t insisted I try it.  It is expensive so I was really  leery, but finally I tried only product on Amazon.  After a week, I went on here for more products!  Love how it works, love how it smells (none of that sickening &#x27;your grandma&#x27;s old car freshener smell that&#x27;s toxic and popular now), and you only need a tiny amount.  Other products say that, but for this one, it&#x27;s true.  You won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! I do not use it on my scalp, however, because if I do it makes my roots look oily. I have very dry ends and this helps keep them feeling and looking healthy.</li>
    <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS IT WORKS WONDERS</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a hair product line to help my thin, fine and brittle hair. With all the glowing reviews on this I thought I would give it a try. So far, it seems to be a huge waste of money. It works okay but I have to use 5 pumps of conditioner to get it through my hair. I also don&#x27;t like the scent. Kind of smells mildewy/moldy. I noticed in some of the other reviews some women were talking about &amp;#34;co-washing&amp;#34; and I tried that too. I see no difference. So.. back to searching for a product line that does what it say&#x27;s it will. This stuff was FAR too expensive for what it does and for the small amount you get.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner it is the best I have ever used. I am a barber stylist and used many of them but this one makes my hair feel like silk and styles out wonderful. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner in conjunction with the miracle shampoo plus keratin. The conditioner isn&#x27;t over the top good, but it does the job i believe. I like to mix it with the deep conditioner plus keratin and it makes my hair feel like silk. It smells really yummy too. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product except, I meant to order the leave in treatment.  I love 10&#x27;s products!! The leave in treatment is my all time favorite.</li>
    <li> this product is awful smelling. it smells like its old and the pump is broken it looked like it was already used and. i was not pleased. i would buy from this company again IF they send the right product.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It&#x27;s more expensive than other drug store conditioners but it&#x27;s really worth it. Think about it-you only have one set of hair for the rest of your life-treat it right with it&#x27;s a 10. The smell is great and it makes your hair very soft and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair oily or anything-if anyone has issues with that don&#x27;t put it on your roots (you should really never put any conditioner on the roots because your natural oils hydrate that area anywhere).</li>
    <li> I works great, but is made of artificial stuff.</li>
    <li> I used this plus It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Shampoo + Keratin. I have thin, long, dry hair and this conditioner was way too light for it. (In other words it didn&#x27;t tickle my fancy) I can see it for people whose hair gets greasy easily or only need a light conditioner to follow up with the shampooing. It smelled amazing and the conditioner had a luscious feel to it. It&#x27;s just not for me. :]</li>
    <li> Will continue to use regularly love that you can find some where at a bit of a lower price - always a nice perk!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long hair. Finally a conditioner that works. Expensive, but really works.</li>
    <li> I love this product and so does my granddaughter. Such a good price on this item, I ordered 4 bottles.</li>
    <li> After first application my hair felt great, so smooth and easy to fix. But after 4th or 5th day my hair felt too dry, that I had to stop using it and go back to my dry and damage hair conditioner. If you have a dry hair like mine I don&#x27;t recommend you to buy it, instead buy the leave in conditioner, that one worked better for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically rave about beauty products, particularly hair products, but my mother recently recommended I try this product and it&#x27;s incredible. I have long, fine but thick, wavy hair that becomes really unruly in humidity. I have been using the daily conditioner for over a week now and it&#x27;s totally eliminated the need for a daily blow dry or a flattening iron. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product and will definitely keep using.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and need to use a lot of this to see great results. I sometimes use a little on the ends instead. It works and I can tell my hair has been conditioned, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a product I MUST have. I think I may go back to the drugstore L&#x27;Oreal Paris for a deep conditioner. I will however continue to purchase their Leave-in conditioner which is awesome.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel. It&#x27;s a 10 makes awesome hair products. Arrived quickly. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for colored hair. Only have to yse less the a dime size amount.</li>
    <li> Got it 1 day earlier than expected. Tried it out, and it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I like the product results but hated the smell.  I think the smell is to overpowering</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife after she professionally straightened her hair because they recommended this particular brand due to it&#x27;s good reputation, and it worked great. She loved it and she continues on using it till today.</li>
    <li> Great product and supplier!!</li>
    <li> love this conditioner, my hair stylist uses it, Thank you</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try the shampoo and conditioner since I loved the hair mask from It&#x27;s a 10. However, this was very disappointing. The shampoo was runny and didn&#x27;t help my hair at all. It actually made it more brittle and dry. I would not recommend buying this product at all. If you are, go to a retailer to make sure it&#x27;s got the right consistency (at least).</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of the leave in conditioner its a 10 for 3 years now. There is nothing out there on the market that is even comparable. the shipping was prompet and i would re order from this seller.</li>
    <li> While I love the spray on leave in version of It&#x27;s a 10, the regular conditioner is awful and made my hair fall out... It does not work well.  Stick with the leave in with keratin and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> This is a super product!  I dilute it half water/half product and it works fine.  It does everything it claims to do.</li>
    <li> It has a really strong floral smell to it and it works wonders!  Its on the expensive side for conditioner but its worth the money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after picking up the It&#x27;s a 10: Miracle Leave in Condition at my hairdresser.  I now use both products.  They leave my hair soft and help tame the frizz of my graying and curly hair.  They have a great fragrance.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years and love it!</li>
    <li> It works good but I thought I was ordering the leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, nor does it make it feel greasy. Ive tried everything for my fine, yet thick hair and this is MY choice! Love this!!!</li>
    <li> Does an okay job at conditioning, but certainly not up to the standards of the spray conditioner.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is a must to have will do everything and more that you need for your hair and at a great cost.</li>
    <li> I love using this item. The only problem is that it is to small and a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle.  I love it. I swim everyday and need something to keep my hair from turning to straw.  This product does the trick.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty darn good.. great for unruly hair .. tames it down and not flat.. from the moment I washed my hair I felt a difference.. NOt like other conditioners that make your hair way too soft..smells SO good too</li>
    <li> not the original product-</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful conditioner that works great. Perfect for a guest room becuase it works well on all hair types.</li>
    <li> Very soothing for frequently dyed hair.  It leaves hair smelling fantastic for days and makes my hair feel young again!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, it makes my hair so easy to style.  No more frizz!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I have every tried. It is highly concentrated. My hair is better than ever before. The first time I used it I pumped out enough for a week. It is lasting much longer than the any average conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bleach my hair alot so I can color it with bright unnatural colors. When you&#x27;re trying to bleach your hair to white for pastel colors it can end up being pretty damaged and straw-like. This conditioner works wonders on my hair! I use it for a week or so after bleaching and it makes my hair so baby soft.</li>
    <li> Works well but smells awful.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this, I was not satisfied and was convinced that I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. However, after two weeks I started noticing a huge difference in my hair. It has volume, bounce, the curls (I have very curly, wavy, frizzy hair) and helped to give my hair some hold.  Again, give this product some time and you will be very happy. I do use this in conjunction with the It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Shampoo.</li>
    <li> this is good conditioner, especially if you have dry, frizzy hair.  i think i like the spray better than the pump bottle; however, you could possibly transfer into a spray bottle if desired.  i would recommend this product, but it is pricey, so make certain you check out the best deals amazon has to offer.</li>
    <li> My HG Conditioner.  Makes my hair very soft and manageable.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of thin frizzy strands of hair (i have a natural medium wave) and have been trying to find a good conditioner since i also color my hair. After the first use my hair was very soft, didnt tangle or frizz when i blow dried or scrunched it, and it smelled fabulous! My hair dresser even noticed my hair was healthier the next time i saw her and told me this is a highly reccomended product among hair stylists. It is pricy but works well and you dont have to use a lot at one time so it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> i WAS UNSURE WHETHER TO ORDER THIS . i HAVE THE LEAVE IN CONDITIONER WHICH I LOVE, AND THIS CONDITIONER LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOFT BUT NOT WEIGHED DOWN.</li>
    <li> I will never stop using this conditioner unless of course they stop making it , then I will cry. This stuff makes my hair so soft and smooth when I use it with the shampoo and leave in spray conditioner. I have thick wavy hair that gets puffy and frizzy easily and it stays under control with this :)</li>
    <li> The pump did not work. Now it&#x27;s a hassle using it. Honestly, not sure if it did anything for my hair (somewhat thick and dry). My hair feels good when it&#x27;s in use but there wasn&#x27;t a noticeable affect for my hair. Not sure if this is the real deal..</li>
    <li> I know I will have a great hair day when I use this stuff! My hair is so soft and is easy to hair dry. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner for curly hair - really adds moisture to your hair and contains frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Vendor was excellent - shipped as described.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I ever had for my hair.  Works great.  You might think a bit costly, but it is sooooo worth it.</li>
    <li> love this product- best price around.</li>
    <li> My mother gave me the shampoo has a gift for christmas, so I purchased the conditioner and the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; leave-in conditioner to fill out the product line. Of the 3, this conditioner is my favorite! It is very conditioning, but still light. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my very fine hair down, but really does a good job on keeping my ends nourished. The bottle seems small, but a little goes a long way. The pump top does a really great job of regulating use and not allowing for wasted product.</li>
    <li> My Hair is Shinning now That I use 10 Miracle all you need for a great condition.</li>
    <li> Good stuff... i made the mistake thinking it was the leave in product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it as part of my hair regimen and feel it makes my hair healthier. My hair has been growing quickly and I believe it&#x27;s the good stuff in this bottle helping!</li>
    <li> A SMALL AMOUNT GOES ALONG WAY&amp;#60; AND LEAVES MY HAIR SILKY AND CLEAN TO THE TOUCH&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve tried them ALL!</li>
    <li> Really good detangle conditional!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product - much less than what I would pay buying it at the salon.</li>
    <li> If you have fine curly hair - this product will only dry it out more (it has alcohol in it) and weight down the curls (i.e. no bounce, no curl).  Disappointing.  I purchase the product based on a friend’s recommendation and other reviews - it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the difference with any other conditioner. I liked the smell and the presentation of the product, however I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> eh.... didn&#x27;t see the big deal</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product!</li>
    <li> My bottle was not closed properly and some leaked out. Other this this I&#x27;m a happy lady with gorgeous hair :)</li>
    <li> Very good product, but if you have thin hair it tends to weigh down.</li>
    <li> not what i was expecting. i heard a lot of good things about these products. they are not cheap so i was expecting my hair to be looking great. my other products work better. i am not particularly fond of the smell either.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because I heard good things about It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle products and I needed a product to make my dry,dull, straw-like bleached hair go back to feeling normal. I was sick of how my hair felt damaged and I was thinking about coloring my hair brown again solely because I wanted to fix the texture of my hair even though I love and still do love having blonde hair. I am really glad I found It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Conditioner and the rest of the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle line because thanks to these products I can continue bleaching my hair and not have my hair look or feel damaged. The conditioner really helped to not only make my hair silkier, but softer, stronger and shinier as well.The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the price, which is why I like to alternate between using this conditioner and a cheaper one especially for colored hair so that I can make this conditioner last a bit longer. So far doing this has been working great. The whole line is great but I highly recommend this conditioner and if your hair needs a bit oompf to make it even more silky I would pick up the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Conditioner Spray as well. These products made my hair feel just like it did before I ever colored it, which is silky and soft, and for that I am so happy and thankful for finding them.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  Makes my dry, colored hair look good. I use it with the 10 miracle hair mask.</li>
    <li> I love this line, It really does work great, I am older my hair is older, I have some grey, so I was using a couple other high end products, but my hair was falling out, so I had noticed this at the store and figured what did I really have to lose that I wasn&#x27;t already losing anyways,  I started using this a couple months ago and with in the first week I noticed hardly any hair was in the shower and it was all still on my head were it belongs, I also noticed how soft and manageable it had become and other were have been asking what I did different because my hair looks so shiny and healthy. I use this conditioner, shampoo, as well as the weekly mask that is also a part of the It&#x27;s A 10 line, So yes this is truly a miracle product!  Extra bounce it is way cheaper here on Amazon then in the stores.</li>
