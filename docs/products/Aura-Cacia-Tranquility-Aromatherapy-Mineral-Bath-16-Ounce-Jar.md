    <li> I love these bath salts and cannot imagine a bath without it!! The aroma is sooooo soothing and relaxing. Great way to end a day (or start a day for that matter!!).</li>
    <li> I love enhancing my bathing experience with bath salts, etc. This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent. He loves snuggling close after I&#x27;ve used this product. :)</li>
    <li> this is the best.  love the smell.</li>
    <li> This makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a spa instead of soaking in my bathtub.  The smell/aroma is just so relaxing.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I but this product in smaller packets at retail stores too, especially this aroma. So tranquil!</li>
    <li> I received the product on the date as promised.  I LOVE this product!  It relaxes me and the smell is WONDERFUL.  I mixed it with my body scrub so that I could use it in the shower and not just the bath..........what a fabulous idea!</li>
    <li> This smells soooo good.  We use in our bath regularily.  Skin feels soft after using.  Free shipping too. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The scent that comes off of the water is bliss. Of all my bath salts and bath products, nothing else has come close to touching this one. The aroma is so relaxing. It instantly calms me. Another perk is that it makes my bathroom smell good far after the bath is over. The scent lingers in the air (and on my skin) for the rest of the day. It is heavenly.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have read the description more carefully.  However, I assumed with a name like &amp;#34;Tranquil Chamomile,&amp;#34; the product I would receive would smell like CHAMOMILE.  It does not.  At all.  It smells like all  of the &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; items (see tiny print on the picture of the label.)  If you are looking for any type of aromatherapy, you may enjoy this product.  However, if you-like me- were hoping for chamomile and hate the smell of lavender, you will hate this product.  It&#x27;s going back immediately!</li>
    <li> This one smells medicinal to me and frankly I know this one jar will last a long time - it&#x27;s just not for me</li>
    <li> This aroma is so soothing and relaxing. I love this pleasing chamomile scent. I bought this aroma for my mother.</li>
    <li> I love the smell! I can&#x27;t stop using this product!</li>
    <li> Love this! My favorite relaxing bath time scent.</li>
    <li> These bath salts have a really pleasant and relaxing smell. They make my bath smell like an expensive spa. If you can get a good price, I highly recommend this scent.</li>
    <li> While chamomile is typically thought of as a night time, relaxation helper... This bath salt has other essential oils that round out the experience.  I find this scent to be very pleasing any time of day.  I highly recommend this bath salt.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy it  very relaxing</li>
    <li> Genuine spa experience. Hot water, steam, candlelight and there you have it. A 300 dollar night in a luxury hotel spa. If you want relaxation you have to try this. I am sure you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Heavenly Scented! They add so much all-natural essence oil fragrance to this!  BEST SOAK ON THE MARKET!</li>
    <li> Wonderful bath product as usual from Aura Cacia. I love using it. I have never used this one before and I am so pleased. It smells great and is very soothing. It is really fragrant and I am so pleased with my purchase.  It arrived quickly and was very well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells relaxing and softening to skin</li>
    <li> Best bath salts ever. My wife loves them.</li>
    <li> used this product for yrs but having trouble finding it locally. This was a good price and good shipping</li>
