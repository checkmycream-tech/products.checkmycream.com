      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love &amp;#34;Child&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>and I lost my favorite fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I will gladly use this way of online service again.</li>
      <li>I love how this perfume is not mass-marketed.</li>
      <li>BUY THIS PERFUME and enjoy how sexy you&#x27;ll smell.</li>
      <li>I was searching for it for a long time, and to no avail Amazon came through.&lt;br /&gt;You will be very happy with it, it is strong at first but blends nicely with your body chem.</li>
      <li>Love this fresh scent!</li>
      <li>the scent would be too strong.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so strong that it&#x27;s not wearable.</li>
      <li>,I thought it was too strong.</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with the product I purched and in the fast and easy way I could order it.</li>
      <li>ok I digress, let me just say the Child was worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I swear this is my favorite scent right now and it changes as the day wears on.</li>
      <li>It is clean and unique.</li>
      <li>Ok, so i&#x27;ve been trying to find a new fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, doesn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
      <li>I put a dab under my hairline in the back and if I get hot...it smells nice.</li>
      <li>It is so nice knowing that the actual creator blended and poured by hand my bottle!!!</li>
      <li>but this is fresh and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
      <li>When I first got this</li>
      <li>Such as the light scent of copper tone in the summer time and the fresh alluring scent of gardenia.</li>
      <li>scent was entirely too strong and smelled like rebottled Egyptian honeysuckle</li>
      <li>This sensuous oil brings me nostalgia of certain events in my life.</li>
      <li>How come every time I find something I really like, it&#x27;s discontinued or ruined in some way?</li>
      <li>too much Gardenia...</li>
      <li>I was shocked after buying it that it was considered so wonderful.</li>
      <li>I thought this perfume would smell good because of the price and recognition of its brand, but I was wrong, it smells like a skunk.</li>
      <li>It does seem to last a decent amount of time.</li>

<li> As for the Kai, I&#x27;m going to take a trip tomorrow to Nordstroms and smell it there and see if it&#x27;s really supposed to smell like rotten flowers, if not I will go back in my order log and send the vendor a complaint letter.</li>
<li> I was slightly disappointed as this smelled a little less \\&quot;potent\\&quot; than the original one I have, but I still love it.  </li>
<li> cuz it&#x27;s a roll on and only a little is needed.</li>
<li> I expected a spray bottle.</li>
<li> Little goes a long way.</li>
<li> When it began to be mass-marketed, the quality went WAY down</li>
<li> Typically, I wear my usuals...</li>
<li> So few places where you can get this hand blended perfume</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s so weak that you need to re-apply hourly.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s way too expensive for that.</li>
<li> I swear the seller switched the scents on me (putting some fake crap in a Kai bottle) and was worried about what I would get when the Child came.</li>
<li> I wish I had known :-(</li>
<li> I received the Kai and it was horrible!</li>

    <li> This is the only perfume I wear. Others give me a headache but this is fresh and not overpowering. I keep one at home and one in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I thought this perfume would smell good because of the price and recognition of its brand, but I was wrong, it smells like a skunk. I would not recommend nor buy it again.</li>
    <li> It came on time.  And is amazing</li>
    <li> So few places where you can get this hand blended perfume, I&#x27;m so delighted</li>
    <li> smells nice, although not the fragrant for me.</li>
    <li> scent was entirely too strong and smelled like rebottled Egyptian honeysuckle</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and perfect product as stated.</li>
    <li> It smells like grape kool-aid or grape bubble gum.  Not at all pleasant.  I was shocked after buying it that it was considered so wonderful.</li>
    <li> My favorite go to perfume!!</li>
    <li> I love how this perfume is not mass-marketed. I have been wearing this for 10 years now and it is still so exclusive and hasn&#x27;t changed a bit!!!! It is so nice knowing that the actual creator blended and poured by hand my bottle!!! Best scent in the universe! Love it. Love it. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the product I purched and in the fast and easy way I could order it. It arrived just in time like the company promised. I will gladly use this way of online service again. Thank you for the opertunity to voice my opinion. Mz Olimpia Nandin.</li>
    <li> Ok, so i&#x27;ve been trying to find a new fragrance. Typically, I wear my usuals...quelques fleur, allure,chance, michael kors, bvlgari (only mentioned so u get an idea of what i like), anyway, I found out about these 2 fragrances Kai and Child and bought them immediately after reading great reviews. I received the Kai and it was horrible! I swear the seller switched the scents on me (putting some fake crap in a Kai bottle) and was worried about what I would get when the Child came. WELL...NO WORRIES NEEEDED! I purchased it from Ron Robinson here on AMazon (wish I could remember the Kai vendor, I&#x27;d blast em) ok I digress, let me just say the Child was worth every penny. I am used to paying for my perfume but even i thought the cost was pricey for the amount you get but again no worries cuz it&#x27;s a roll on and only a little is needed. I swear this is my favorite scent right now and it changes as the day wears on. OMG, this stuff is lovely! I am asking my friend for the body cream for my birthday this month. Do not hesitate when ordering this, you will not regret it. As for the Kai, I&#x27;m going to take a trip tomorrow to Nordstroms and smell it there and see if it&#x27;s really supposed to smell like rotten flowers, if not I will go back in my order log and send the vendor a complaint letter. BUY THIS PERFUME and enjoy how sexy you&#x27;ll smell. lol</li>
    <li> When I first got this I didn&#x27;t like it....for about 15 minutes....too much Gardenia...BUT then it changes...into the freshest smell ever! It is clean and unique. It does seem to last a decent amount of time. I put a dab under my hairline in the back and if I get hot...it smells nice. Little goes a long way. Excellent value. Presentation was nice with hand written thank you note! This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this luxurious oil for years now and always hear different compliments. This sensuous oil brings me nostalgia of certain events in my life. Such as the light scent of copper tone in the summer time and the fresh alluring scent of gardenia. The scent lasts all day and seems to become more invigorating if you perspire a bit. I&#x27;m a Child by Susan D. Owens customer for life.</li>
    <li> This was a beautiful fragrance.  When it began to be mass-marketed, the quality went WAY down and I lost my favorite fragrance.  How come every time I find something I really like, it&#x27;s discontinued or ruined in some way?</li>
    <li> I ordered this from one of the authorized dealers on the site. At first, I didn&#x27;t like the smell,I thought it was too strong. When you let it settle for a while, it becomes a softer scent. Trust me, I&#x27;ve worn this around men and they do love it. In all fairness, it does depend on your body&#x27;s chemistry as well.</li>
    <li> The only thing to say is BEST SMELL EVER!!  Get stopped all the time to ask what scent I am wearing.</li>
    <li> I was slightly disappointed as this smelled a little less \\&quot;potent\\&quot; than the original one I have, but I still love it.  Thanks, again, for dealing with wonderful retailers.  Loretta</li>
    <li> Great scent but it&#x27;s so weak that you need to re-apply hourly. It&#x27;s way too expensive for that.</li>
    <li> Great smell but irritates my skin</li>
    <li> Love this fresh scent!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, doesn&#x27;t wow me. I put it on my ankles otherwise the scent would be too strong. Might purchase again.</li>
    <li> I expected a spray bottle. Instead I ended up with a roll on. It&#x27;s an oil and it&#x27;s so strong that it&#x27;s not wearable. I love &amp;#34;Child&amp;#34;  but this did not meet my expectations. I wish I had known :-( because it wasn&#x27;t returnable.</li>
    <li> I am really very happy with this fragrance.  I was searching for it for a long time, and to no avail Amazon came through.&lt;br /&gt;You will be very happy with it, it is strong at first but blends nicely with your body chem.</li>
