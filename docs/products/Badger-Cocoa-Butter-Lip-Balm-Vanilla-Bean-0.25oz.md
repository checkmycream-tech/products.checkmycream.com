      <li>Not my favorite lip balm or my favorite Badger product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love these.</li>
      <li>I love the flavor too - vanilla bean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just no my favorite.</li>
      <li>and I carry one with me everywhere :)</li>
      <li>This is not a terrible product.</li>
      <li>This is one of my all-time favorite products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been really excited about lip balm before, but this lip balm rocks!</li>
      <li>This is a great chap stick that feels nice, but is not addictive like some others.</li>
      <li>So the whole product line is good for me.</li>
      <li>It has a great Vanilla scent, the balm is soft and easy to apply and lasts.</li>
      <li>It feels nice, smells nice, lasts well, makes my lips soft</li>
      <li>This is a good lip balm as far as consistency,  but the smell is more of a cocoa butter than vanilla.  </li>

      <li>This is my true favorite.</li>
      <li>This has a nice scent and is very moisturizing.  </li>

      <li>Seriously the best lip balm I have ever used in my 23 years of existence.</li>
      <li>The tube itself very big for a lip balm stick, but it&#x27;s not a problem and makes up for the fact that it is a pricier (but much more effective and healthy) buy than most other drug store lip balms.</li>
      <li>Badger, you guys really create some amazing natural products!</li>
      <li>I still use it with something else that I enjoy the smell of because it really does feel nice on my dry lips.</li>
      <li>I have other balms that are pretty good</li>
      <li>only okay.</li>
      <li>This product is very good, I use it every night to help keep my lips soft and moist and in the morning my lips are so smooth and naturally blushed that when I put on lipliner I don&#x27;t have to pull or press hard on the pencil.</li>
      <li>Really helps very chapped lips!</li>
      <li>While Chapsticks gets lips softer, after prolonged period of time it makes my lips to dry up even more.</li>
      <li>I really like the feel of this on my lips.</li>
      <li>I really like this balm, as it really holds up when I&#x27;m riding my bike.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, it actually soaks into my lips, and it is lanolin free.  </li>
      <li>(smell is reminiscent to cheap Palmer&#x27;s easter chocolate..</li>
      <li>where it feels nice but then leaves your lips dried out.</li>
      <li>Makes my lips sooo smooth and lasts for a long time!</li>
      <li>my husband thinks so too, I would highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other natural lip balms before but these work so much more.</li>
      <li>The balm is smooth and long lasting, a real savior in all weather.</li>
      <li>It felt great - but has a yucky artificial fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and feel of this product not greasy or too thick.</li>
      <li>Its super moisturizing, never greasy or heavy, or &amp;#34;fake-moisturizing&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>and finally I found something that keeps my lips soft</li>
      <li>And the bigger size means its harder to loose (which is where 90% of my lip balms have gone) and also it takes less time to fully apply, and you get more moisture and application out of ever use.</li>

    <li> This is a good lip balm as far as consistency,  but the smell is more of a cocoa butter than vanilla.  I still use it with something else that I enjoy the smell of because it really does feel nice on my dry lips. For every day  moisturizing I prefer Aquaphor lip balm because it heals peeling, chapped lips almost instantly.</li>
    <li> Vanilla Bean Lip balm is just perfect for my and my daughter lips! It softens and hydrates lips beautifully! The smell is pleasant. Will definitely buy another one when this runs out. While Chapsticks gets lips softer, after prolonged period of time it makes my lips to dry up even more. This Vanilla Balm, on the other hand, cures my chappy sun-dried lips, so I do not have to reapply it over and over all day long. Love it!</li>
    <li> Badger is my favorite balm. The smell of this, first of all, is amazing. It&#x27;s not too heady but a delicious blend of cocoa and vanilla.

    <li> good! except the smell lol</li>
    <li> Just what is needed for chapped lips</li>
    <li> This is awesome lip balm. It feels nice, smells nice, lasts well, makes my lips soft and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I call this my crackstick!! Seriously the best lip balm I have ever used in my 23 years of existence. Makes my lips sooo smooth and lasts for a long time! Bigger than your average chapstick. I didn&#x27;t love the smell at first (smell is reminiscent to cheap Palmer&#x27;s easter chocolate.. I ordered the Vanilla Bean), but it really isn&#x27;t bad. Will continue to buy and try different smells! Badger, you guys really create some amazing natural products!</li>
    <li> This is a great chap stick that feels nice, but is not addictive like some others. I love the flavor too - vanilla bean.</li>
    <li> Really helps very chapped lips!</li>
    <li> didnt like it too oily</li>
    <li> I love this lipbalm because theres that lovely cocoa aspect in the background of all the flavors, but then you have whatever scent you super-impose over it. Its super moisturizing, never greasy or heavy, or &amp;#34;fake-moisturizing&amp;#34; where it feels nice but then leaves your lips dried out. This is my true favorite. And the bigger size means its harder to loose (which is where 90% of my lip balms have gone) and also it takes less time to fully apply, and you get more moisture and application out of ever use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the one!! I was looking for, try everything and finally I found something that keeps my lips soft</li>
    <li> Smells horrible. complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This has a nice scent and is very moisturizing.  The product is somewhat chunky and doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly.  The consistency is also a little bit of an issue- it can be very hard if it&#x27;s in a purse in a chilly room but will become downright runny from your body heat if kept in a pocket.  Not my favorite lip balm or my favorite Badger product.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these. Can&#x27;t get enough. I&#x27;ve used other natural lip balms before but these work so much more. The shine and softness stay on for hours and I carry one with me everywhere :)</li>
    <li> My new favorite lip balm! I love the smell and feel of this product not greasy or too thick. Perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, it actually soaks into my lips, and it is lanolin free.  I bought it in several flavors.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite products. I buy it for everyone. I have been using it for years and I plan to continue to use it. Is very creamy and moist and it protects and heals  my lips in the cold weather or in the heat. I carry it everywhere!</li>
    <li> This is not a terrible product. It does however smell and taste only okay. It has a slightly bad smell—kind of like old cocoa butter—but I still use it. It&#x27;s just no my favorite.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. So soothing!</li>
    <li> this is the world&#x27;s best lip balm. I also found it because it contains cocoa butter it decreases my cravings for chocolate.</li>
    <li> The badger is the bomb it makes my lips wet and juicy my husband thinks so too, I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This product is very good, I use it every night to help keep my lips soft and moist and in the morning my lips are so smooth and naturally blushed that when I put on lipliner I don&#x27;t have to pull or press hard on the pencil. Even some spotting and parts of dryness I had from using Avon lipsticks are gone. This last all night/day on. It is not sticky and does smell waxy.</li>
    <li> smell soooooooooo delicious~</li>
    <li> Was looking for an organic lip balm with moisturizing properties that wasn&#x27;t sticky. This fits the bill. Certified organic, no animal testing, and a nice vanilla bean scent. I have one bedside and in my purse. Husband likes it, too.</li>
    <li> I really like this balm, as it really holds up when I&#x27;m riding my bike.  The Vaseline Lip Therapy would just melt away in a few miles, and dry lips bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Badger Balm for skin to keep my elbows, and hands from cracking in winter air.  So the whole product line is good for me.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this on my lips. It is not sticky or greasy like some. The only thing I have to get used to is the slight dip in the center of the stick.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I actually put it in my cart several months back, but then moved it to &amp;#34;saved for later&amp;#34;.  I have other balms that are pretty good so I didn&#x27;t have to have any.  I know Badger is known for their sunblock with no toxic ingredients, so I eventually wanted to try this lip balm.  A friend from Sweden recently brought me a bag of non-toxic goodies, including lots of lip balm.  It felt great - but has a yucky artificial fragrance.  But I figured, you can&#x27;t have it all.  Yes you can!  This balm glides on like butter, no greasies, no waxy feel, and no horrible smell - YAY!  I bought the vanilla bean but my kids and I think it smells like chocolate.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm!  No more dry lips and all natural.  With No chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used, and I have used many.  I am never without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been really excited about lip balm before, but this lip balm rocks! It has a great Vanilla scent, the balm is soft and easy to apply and lasts. Love this stuff!</li>
