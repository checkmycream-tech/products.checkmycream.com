      <li>This is good.</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of original &amp;#34;Le Male&amp;#34;, but this one is awesome for NY summer.  </li>
      <li>It is, without doubt, the best one I&#x27;ve ever come across with the exception of &#x27;Le Male&#x27;, that one is very good as well.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>They scent is amazing</li>
      <li>It is authentic and smells good on me</li>
      <li>The price is just nice by the ml of content in the bottle.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t return it because it is hazardous product, so I am stuck with it.</li>
      <li>, this is a NICE departure from the mainstay accent of citrus.</li>
      <li>That said if you don&#x27;t travel much it&#x27;s the best smelling cologne ever.</li>
      <li>Was a nice gift.</li>
      <li>and i liked it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I have to say that after purchasing this product, I have never received as many compliments  and inquiries about a fragrance as I have with this one.</li>
      <li>More of a woman&#x27;s sent, not for me at all.</li>
      <li>but I like it better</li>
      <li>This is smell that most people will never forget.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed using this product.</li>
      <li>I would buy more for sure.</li>
      <li>I find it familiar, warm and comforting, like a summer afternoon in the garden.&lt;br</li>
      <li>that is beautiful and masculine...</li>
      <li>More like a Easy Breezy Kool</li>
      <li>I could picture this scent going great with very stylish white colored business attire, or any light colored clothes.</li>
      <li>but like a strong blast of a flower guard</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s strong way stronger</li>
      <li>I did not like it, it is too strong.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;you could totally fit effortless&lt;</li>
      <li>It is feminine but it is just such a happy, feel-good scent for men.</li>
      <li>They are both so unique and well-made that any man in any walk of life could make use of them.  </li>
      <li>They all said it has a unique scent.</li>
      <li>This cologne is a great smelling cologne , You will not be sorry with this product it has a great price on amazon.</li>
      <li>so far a nice add on for me</li>
      <li>SWEET N CLEAN--WOMEN LIKEY</li>
      <li>It is so fresh and unique.</li>
      <li>A wonderful sent as well, and will last the entire day.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the quality of the product.i totally recommend you to buy it.</li>
      <li>It does not have that strong spicy smell that most men&#x27;s colognes and fragrances have but a very subtle and appealing one(almost like a vanilla smell) that makes those around you ask &#x27;what kind of fragrance are you wearing and where did you get it&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Keeping it campy, it makes me want to smell myself and smile.</li>
      <li>Much more better than what I expected!</li>
      <li>SUPER for hot and humid NY summer days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautifully lush and light, and proves flowers are nature&#x27;s gift for anyone to take advantage of-- not just the ladies.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say a fancy one - well, better smell like JPG Fleur DU male, than stink from underarms and all over....</li>
      <li>U have to smell it first then buy it, thats what i did</li>
      <li>I have tried many others and always come back to this one.  </li>
      <li>Although, the bottle and tin appear gray they&#x27;re most definitely, white.</li>
      <li>It is very unique and stands out and lasts the entire day.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, price just right.</li>
      <li>this cologne will make you smell like a 60 year old grandma that sprayed her self with too many samples and bath and body works, there is nothing masculine about this cologne, it smells like straight up sweet flowers, i would even find this scent too much on a woman...</li>
      <li>Overall - Perfect (for me at least).</li>
      <li>then la male it has a strong flowery smell to it not like a woman&#x27;s perfume</li>
      <li>tax in store so certainly going to grab it here now.</li>
      <li>I normally do not write reviews, but I simply love this product.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t spray too much, though...</li>
      <li>Product as described but if you are a real man this cologne is not for you...</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something unique, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
      <li>This is a great sent, I little lighter sent, I love it for summer, not as heavy as the Le Male.</li>
      <li>... as a collector, I thought this was a special edition, since the picture shows a gray bottle and not white, as the item</li>
      <li>Unlike many male colognes, Fluer Du male is not a spicy nor citris scent but earthy.</li>
      <li>Well I bought this as a gift for my dad who uses the regular JPG and only that one since 4 years ago, and he told me the smell of this one is much better than the one he used all these years...  </li>
      <li>So I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how fast it was delivered.</li>
      <li>The smell is soft and very permanent in time.</li>
      <li>Harder and harder to get every day, this extinguished Gaultier is still my very favorite in the world.</li>
      <li>Was excited after buying le male always saw and wondered now le male is great but this fleur du male is not good</li>
      <li>It is also very hard to find and am so glad Amazon has this and at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The woody scent is classic, soft but yet masculine.</li>
      <li>Fleur du Male is certainly a gutsy fragrance to wear for a man, as many have called it Le Male&#x27;s little sister with its floral notes, but if you&#x27;re a good-looking, well-dressed man, the risk will pay off.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this item, because the wrapping is cut open and the cologne is not new and it&#x27;s not even the original cologne.</li>
      <li>There is absolutely no residual fragrance after the first 10 minutes of wearing it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light but lasting floral/powder scent that could be used everyday as it won&#x27;t drown your co-workers or yourself for that matter.  </li>
      <li>When i showed them a white tin they were surprised.</li>
      <li>The only problem with me is, I love dark colors and black</li>
      <li>This is a new one for me, as I have only used Le Male by John Paul Gaultier.</li>
      <li>but then the smell goes away and leaves a pleasant enough sensasion, not what I expected but can serve for a casual occasion no surprise animos ..</li>

    <li> A few years ago I was browsing the local megamall and found this cologne (2 boxes left) on Sephora shelves, and tried out the tester.  It&#x27;s a light but lasting floral/powder scent that could be used everyday as it won&#x27;t drown your co-workers or yourself for that matter.  The bottle shown here is dark grey but the one in Sephora was white.  Unfortunately they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it in the Sephora I shopped at and I&#x27;ve tried looking for it in JCPenny&#x27;s and Lord &amp; Taylor&#x27;s (now defunct), but after a year and a half on a whim I tried amazon and low and behold! Paid $59 + tax in store so certainly going to grab it here now.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this as a gift for my dad who uses the regular JPG and only that one since 4 years ago, and he told me the smell of this one is much better than the one he used all these years...  So I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item, because the wrapping is cut open and the cologne is not new and it&#x27;s not even the original cologne. I did the mistake and tell everybody not to do as i did.</li>
    <li> Packaging, value for the size and the shipping speed was perfect for Christmas! Unlike many male colognes, Fluer Du male is not a spicy nor citris scent but earthy. The woody scent is classic, soft but yet masculine.</li>
    <li> More of a woman&#x27;s sent, not for me at all. Nothing like Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male Eau de Toilette. Sold it on eBay, so it&#x27;s not a total loss.</li>
    <li> I gotta tell ya, I absolutely love this fragrance!! It is a perfect \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent if you want people to think of you when they smell this. It is feminine but it is just such a happy, feel-good scent for men. I seriously keep smelling myself all day on my neck and body.... people must thing I have neck problems!! It is just simply a beautiful scent! The only problem with me is, I love dark colors and black and I wear that almost everyday, and this scent just doesnt seem to match with my wardrobe. I could picture this scent going great with very stylish white colored business attire, or any light colored clothes. Good for ages 17- 35. TRY THIS OUT!</li>
    <li> One of the best underrated fragrances ever!</li>
    <li> I normally do not write reviews, but I simply love this product. Keeping it campy, it makes me want to smell myself and smile. It has a flower based smell, that is beautiful and masculine...which may seem contradictory, but it is not. This is smell that most people will never forget. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> patchouli a bit annoying at first but then the smell goes away and leaves a pleasant enough sensasion, not what I expected but can serve for a casual occasion no surprise animos ..</li>
    <li> Fleur du Male challenges what a \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; fragrance can be. It&#x27;s soapy and green, but unlike a lot of other male scents, it&#x27;s distinctly floral. Not feminine, but miles away from the citrus/fresh scents that dominate the men&#x27;s market. Aqua di Gio this is not. I find it familiar, warm and comforting, like a summer afternoon in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a softer Gaultier Le Male, without the spicy nighttime notes. The powdery drydown is especially memorable, almost haunting. It&#x27;s unlike anything else on the market, and takes a lot of confidence to wear. If you&#x27;re looking for something unique, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 4.2 oz and it came with a music box and a body wash great price and Amazon you Rock.......I would shop again and also buy this colonge.</li>
    <li> SWEET N CLEAN--WOMEN LIKEY</li>
    <li> U have to smell it first then buy it, thats what i did and i liked it. I would buy more for sure.</li>
    <li> What year was this perfume introduced</li>
    <li> This is good. SUPER for hot and humid NY summer days. Although some people don&#x27;t like powdery scents and so do I, but this is exception. I am not a fan of original &amp;#34;Le Male&amp;#34;, but this one is awesome for NY summer.  Some say it smells like baby talcum powder... I&#x27;d say a fancy one - well, better smell like JPG Fleur DU male, than stink from underarms and all over.... Also, this fragrance can be layered with any fragrance in my opinion. I know some people do it. I do it too sometimes. Overall - Perfect (for me at least).</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time, but it wasn&#x27;t what i expected.  It had a very industrial, chemical smell - just terrible.  I couldn&#x27;t help but think that it may have been a counterfeit.</li>
    <li> Product as described but if you are a real man this cologne is not for you... I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about when they say masculine flower scent... this cologne will make you smell like a 60 year old grandma that sprayed her self with too many samples and bath and body works, there is nothing masculine about this cologne, it smells like straight up sweet flowers, i would even find this scent too much on a woman... like I said if you are a man you will not like this cologne, stick to LA male, la male terrible or even their summer scent is nice as a lighter scent but this is just a disgrace to their male line of fragrance, mark it perfume and sell it to the women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never again gonna order fragrances from amazon. The last two orders i suspect are counterfeits. There is absolutely no residual fragrance after the first 10 minutes of wearing it.</li>
    <li> Harder and harder to get every day, this extinguished Gaultier is still my very favorite in the world.</li>
    <li> Although, the bottle and tin appear gray they&#x27;re most definitely, white. Must be bad lighting? Told my mom and brother, &amp;#34;I got some Jean Paul Gaultier coming.&amp;#34; They only know of Le Male. When i showed them a white tin they were surprised. They expected the tin that Le Male comes in. I also seen quite a bit of reviews YouTube. They all said it has a unique scent. And i don&#x27;t know anyone who has it. Again, This Is The Best Smelling Cologne I Have!</li>
    <li> Of the major Jean Paul Gaultier fragrances on the market today (Le Male, Le Male Terrible, Gaultier2, Le Male Summer, and Fleur Du Male) only Le Male and this fragrance are must haves.  They are both so unique and well-made that any man in any walk of life could make use of them.  Fleur du Male is certainly a gutsy fragrance to wear for a man, as many have called it Le Male&#x27;s little sister with its floral notes, but if you&#x27;re a good-looking, well-dressed man, the risk will pay off.  You will get noticed; if you don&#x27;t want to be noticed, put on some deodorant and wear t-shirts and vans the rest of your life.  Good luck with that.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how fast it was delivered. Authentic product, very good price!</li>
    <li> One of the best cologne&#x27;s on the planet! I&#x27;ve been a fan for about 8 years. They scent is amazing but it leaks if you put it in a bath bag for travel for some reason from the spray nozzle. That said if you don&#x27;t travel much it&#x27;s the best smelling cologne ever.</li>
    <li> The smell is soft and very permanent in time. The price is just nice by the ml of content in the bottle. Was a nice gift.</li>
    <li> This is a very sexy, sensual cologne! Love it!</li>
    <li> Was excited after buying le male always saw and wondered now le male is great but this fleur du male is not good it&#x27;s very dead flowers smell not really something I wear bought wife classique for wife and it was also a let down</li>
    <li> This is a new one for me, as I have only used Le Male by John Paul Gaultier. This is a great sent, I little lighter sent, I love it for summer, not as heavy as the Le Male. A wonderful sent as well, and will last the entire day.</li>
    <li> I got this today and I haven&#x27;t put it on yet but I can just tell by the smell from the bottle it&#x27;s strong way stronger then la male it has a strong flowery smell to it not like a woman&#x27;s perfume but like a strong blast of a flower guard but I like it better then la male so far a nice add on for me at least but that&#x27;s just me I would say if you can get a simple be for you buy this</li>
    <li> “Like A Male, You Shall Not Smell - Like A Gal, Whom Is Your Pal You Shall!”-Lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY, this is a NICE departure from the mainstay accent of citrus. And no, you shall not smell like a Gal. More like a Easy Breezy Kool Guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you seek a diverse repertoire of scents - to accommodate your wardrobe, mood or inclination, then ye should not be without Jean Paul GAULTIER’s Fleur Du Male.</li>
    <li> I did not like it, it is too strong.</li>
    <li> Great longetivity (20+ hours) and projection. Perfect for spring. Don&#x27;t spray too much, though... If you like Le Male, you will like this one as well.</li>
    <li> This fragrance haunts me. I will never forget it. It&#x27;s beautifully lush and light, and proves flowers are nature&#x27;s gift for anyone to take advantage of-- not just the ladies.</li>
    <li> ... as a collector, I thought this was a special edition, since the picture shows a gray bottle and not white, as the item I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have opened a complaint but I can&#x27;t return it because it is hazardous product, so I am stuck with it.</li>
    <li> I have to say that after purchasing this product, I have never received as many compliments  and inquiries about a fragrance as I have with this one. It is very unique and stands out and lasts the entire day.  It does not have that strong spicy smell that most men&#x27;s colognes and fragrances have but a very subtle and appealing one(almost like a vanilla smell) that makes those around you ask &#x27;what kind of fragrance are you wearing and where did you get it&#x27;.  I have tried many others and always come back to this one.  It is, without doubt, the best one I&#x27;ve ever come across with the exception of &#x27;Le Male&#x27;, that one is very good as well.  At least try it and see for yourself and you will notice others asking you about it.  It is also very hard to find and am so glad Amazon has this and at a very reasonable price.</li>
