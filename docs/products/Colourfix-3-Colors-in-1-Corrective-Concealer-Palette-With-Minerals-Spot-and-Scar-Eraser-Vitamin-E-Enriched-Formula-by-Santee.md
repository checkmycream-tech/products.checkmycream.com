      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love the consistency of the concealers, they are very easy to apply and blend!</li>
      <li>I loved this product and have purchased more of them.</li>
      <li>I am able to fit it into my makeup bag, which I do a lot of on the run make up rituals, this is great.</li>
      <li>By far the best under eye concealer I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s made with minerals it&#x27;s super good on your skin, and won&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I can say I love it</li>
      <li>wish it was a tad more pigmented, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Ok peach coverage over discoleration.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to get a darker color in the coral, but it&#x27;s not terrible, just ok..</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>When you apply it the ski doesnt look ok.</li>
      <li>colors do their job well and apply easily</li>
      <li>Creases so easily.</li>
      <li>Product is just ok, the colors are super pigmented but also goes on muddy.</li>
      <li>Affordable and shipped quickly!</li>
      <li>Wish it had a a better explanation on exactly how to apply it...</li>
      <li>I have mix oily skin specially T zone.</li>
      <li>Must use sparingly and, under a full- coverage concealer and/ or full coverage foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, this is a really nice small corrector palette.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the darker colored concealer because it really does a great job of covering any red spots on your face, or bags under your eyes.  </li>
      <li>but it makes a good high light for dark circles in my opinion :)</li>
      <li>This is EXACTLY what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>colours are nice but the consistencyis not proper.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was expecting from this product.</li>
      <li>I cover it with instant age brightner and it disappears:)</li>
      <li>Colors worked fine and did not dry under eye skin.</li>
      <li>Also, the green was great for covering red blemishes.</li>
      <li>, i don&#x27;t use the purple much</li>
      <li>It covers very well.</li>
      <li>This really did the job.</li>
      <li>It never dried after application, so when you apply foundation on top of it, it simply disappears into the foundation, and doesn&#x27;t do any concealing at all.  </li>
      <li>I love using this to cover blemishes and other imperfections</li>
      <li>The brush is sad but the product is great</li>
      <li>but I can say it worked with covering a huge dark mark from a pimple.</li>
      <li>I tried everything and other concealers but did some research and found that certain corrective colors cover better because they cancel out the dark spot.</li>
      <li>I found it easy to apply and buff into the skin and and the correction is spot on, reduces the dark patches and red tones in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
      <li>solid buy at a decent price, I&#x27;ve purchased 2 so far.</li>
      <li>I mostly use the orange one but have tried the green for a red zit and it works somewhat to reduce the red color.</li>
      <li>Its exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t leave the house unless my skin looks clear, with makeup and concealers you can fake perfect skin, believe me, it sucks to walk around at work and have to talk to people when you are in the middle of a break-out.</li>
      <li>General concealers come in very light colors, rather then the dark Green, purple &amp; orange.  </li>
      <li>the orange color really works for my dark acne scarring!</li>

<li> the orange color really works for my dark acne scarring!</li>

<li> It lasts a long time too, I work 12 hour shifts</li>
<li> I would recommend this concealer to anyone who has dark spots or red spots, even acne, on their face, they are looking to cover.  </li>
<li> also, just in case you&#x27;re wondering: Yes, I used primer (smash box face primer &amp; urban decay primer for my eyes) and: Yes, I even sealed my foundation (and green skin) with Anastasia Beverly Hills powder.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>

<li> the green for any active redness from current acne</li>
<li> The green covers red spots and the purple lightens dark circles under the eyes, and the orange evens out my freckles!</li>
<li> does it cover dark marks</li>
<li> I thought that the orange covered my dark circles well underneath my eye cream.</li>
<li> i wasn&#x27;t expected to small</li>
<li> They stay put all day and its just what I need to cover dark circles and acne scars!</li>
<li> This little correction palate works like a charm.</li>
<li> use a light/ medium coverage foundation and the green correction pigment shines through.</li>
<li> It eliminates my redness, but also colors me a sea foam green all day.</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s definitely in the \\&quot;crap</li>
<li> Oh my goodness, was I wrong.</li>
<li> Sorry to say &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34;, but I do.  </li>
<li> Product is in bad condition and defective</li>

    <li> the orange color really works for my dark acne scarring! the green for any active redness from current acne, i don&#x27;t use the purple much but it makes a good high light for dark circles in my opinion :)</li>
    <li> Product is in bad condition and defective</li>
    <li> Love it. ..i wasn&#x27;t expected to small but it works very nice! !</li>
    <li> It realy help on the need of your face very good product.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34;, but I do.  This product did not work at all for me.  It never dried after application, so when you apply foundation on top of it, it simply disappears into the foundation, and doesn&#x27;t do any concealing at all.  I tried all of the colors, with mineral foundation, liquid foundation, loose powder - various combinations and it never did any concealing.</li>
    <li> I finally can cover up post acne marks without seeing them through my make up and this product is inexpensive. I&#x27;m so happy</li>
    <li> colors do their job well and apply easily</li>
    <li> Great coverage! I am a drag performer so I use the orange shade to erase my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and it works wonders! Because it&#x27;s made with minerals it&#x27;s super good on your skin, and won&#x27;t cause irritation. Definitely a GREAT product for the price!</li>
    <li> Orange is actually butterscotch colors</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of the concealers, they are very easy to apply and blend! They stay put all day and its just what I need to cover dark circles and acne scars!</li>
    <li> Great for my purse and for travel - thank you!</li>
    <li> The brush is sad but the product is great</li>
    <li> Ok peach coverage over discoleration.</li>
    <li> I love using this to cover blemishes and other imperfections</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Creases so easily.</li>
    <li> Love it! By far the best under eye concealer I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> cheaper option, but does the work .</li>
    <li> Product is just ok, the colors are super pigmented but also goes on muddy. Must use sparingly and, under a full- coverage concealer and/ or full coverage foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I use a light/ medium coverage foundation and the green correction pigment shines through. It eliminates my redness, but also colors me a sea foam green all day. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;And also, just in case you&#x27;re wondering: Yes, I used primer (smash box face primer &amp; urban decay primer for my eyes) and: Yes, I even sealed my foundation (and green skin) with Anastasia Beverly Hills powder.&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t be going in the trash just yet, but it&#x27;s definitely in the \\&quot;crap I don&#x27;t use any more\\&quot; junk makeup drawer.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it with derma blend! great coverage!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting from this product. I am able to fit it into my makeup bag, which I do a lot of on the run make up rituals, this is great. It had all the required colors I needed, very happy!</li>
    <li> I was worry this wouldn&#x27;t work well like the others that I&#x27;ve tried. Oh my goodness, was I wrong. This little correction palate works like a charm. It covers very well. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Happy covering!!</li>
    <li> Great for any redness on face.</li>
    <li> This is EXACTLY what I was looking for! General concealers come in very light colors, rather then the dark Green, purple &amp; orange.  I prefer the darker colored concealer because it really does a great job of covering any red spots on your face, or bags under your eyes.  I would recommend this concealer to anyone who has dark spots or red spots, even acne, on their face, they are looking to cover.  It works GREAT!</li>
    <li> These are great! Affordable and shipped quickly! The green covers red spots and the purple lightens dark circles under the eyes, and the orange evens out my freckles! Add your favorite concealer and flawless!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I can say I love it, it&#x27;s just concealer but I can say it worked with covering a huge dark mark from a pimple. I tried everything and other concealers but did some research and found that certain corrective colors cover better because they cancel out the dark spot. I needed something like this to conceal scars while time works to fade them out. Sometimes it takes 2 or three months before it fades and my foundation is all I need. I mostly use the orange one but have tried the green for a red zit and it works somewhat to reduce the red color. I would recommend definitely if you are like me and are concerned about every spot on your face. I can&#x27;t leave the house unless my skin looks clear, with makeup and concealers you can fake perfect skin, believe me, it sucks to walk around at work and have to talk to people when you are in the middle of a break-out. This really did the job. It lasts a long time too, I work 12 hour shifts and I only touch up my oily face with powder and the concealer holds up. I did a lot of research and read a ton of reviews and I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great concealers for all occations! I amon my 4th one!</li>
    <li> wish it was a tad more pigmented, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> The best fix when u have onenof them days when you have face demons or lack of sleep.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, this is a really nice small corrector palette.  I found it easy to apply and buff into the skin and and the correction is spot on, reduces the dark patches and red tones in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Nice solid buy at a decent price, I&#x27;ve purchased 2 so far.</li>
    <li> I like this kit. How ever it feels oily on face after a while. I have mix oily skin specially T zone. So take that in mind if you want to buy it.</li>
    <li> Colors worked fine and did not dry under eye skin.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get a darker color in the coral, but it&#x27;s not terrible, just ok..</li>
    <li> I loved this product and have purchased more of them.</li>
    <li> so so... it made me broke out though so i threw it away does it cover dark marks yes if u know how to blend</li>
    <li> Its exactly what I expected.  Wish it had a a better explanation on exactly how to apply it...but I guess thats what youtube and pinterest are for.</li>
    <li> Item was as described. Good buy</li>
    <li> colours are nice but the consistencyis not proper. When you apply it the ski doesnt look ok. It should &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;with the skin. Instead looks like a powder surplus.</li>
    <li> I thought that the orange covered my dark circles well underneath my eye cream. Also, the green was great for covering red blemishes.</li>
    <li> I love it! It definitely works. I cover it with instant age brightner and it disappears:)</li>
