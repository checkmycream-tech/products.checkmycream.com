      <li>I can tell they are trying too hard to make you believe they&#x27;re the real thing because they are literally black, whereas real black soap is actually light or dark brown and are even able to be molded.</li>

    <li> Super clean aroma and feel every day!</li>
    <li> Love, love,love this soap! Lathers real good, pleasant smell and makes my skin feel so soft. Just don&#x27;t use a white or light color washcloth. It will eventually discolor/stain your cloth over time.</li>
    <li> very very very goood&lt;br /&gt;amazing realy</li>
    <li> best soap ever..doesn&#x27;t dry your skin..it&#x27;s my skin cure all</li>
    <li> So far so good,  love the fact soap lathers up quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Creamy wonderful with no residue! This is the only soap we keep in the house. The scent is so refreshing. I keep several on hand to give them away to friends.</li>
    <li> Always receive on time and no problems.</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;m always buying this soap, love it</li>
    <li> Best soap ever. Does wonders for ethnic skin.</li>
    <li> Love this 100% natural product. Leaves your skin smooth and soft. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Black Soap for years now; I love the rich creamy lather. All it takes is a drop of water and there&#x27;s an instant lather. Store bought soaps do not compare. I wash my hair with it. When I&#x27;m showering, it goes from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet. It gives me such a refreshing, clean feeling. It also has medicinal qualities to it. I use it as a facial mask for 20 minutes or so then I rinse it off; my skin feels tight, yet soft and clean. It also heals your skin. There are soaps out on the market that are impostors and do not come close to the real thing. I can tell they are trying too hard to make you believe they&#x27;re the real thing because they are literally black, whereas real black soap is actually light or dark brown and are even able to be molded. My daughters and I love this product soooooo much!!!</li>
    <li> Boxes came opened this is a big inconvenience. But nonetheless a great soap!</li>
    <li> The only soap my son &amp; I use. FANTASTIC ! try it out ?</li>
    <li> love this soap my whole family uses this</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. Clears your skin up so nice. Works for my tween who prior to this product, suffered from mild to severe acne. Must use good oil or lotion after use. I use virgin coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boys say it looks like poop. LOL I dont care, it works.</li>
    <li> Makes my dry skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This Is The Best Soap Ever!!!! 😍😍😍</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It really works...Very fast delivery..</li>
    <li> I was nervous using this at first, but I quickly got over that. I can&#x27;t believe how well this lathers without any synthetics! I don&#x27;t know why people are complaining about the smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin. Great product for a natural soap for the price. So many of these natural soaps on the market are way over priced and dissolve quickly. This bar will last a good while.</li>
    <li> This is awesome product... works great and I really enjoy it. Recommended!</li>

    <li> Very useful for my skin.</li>
