      <li>This stuff works and looks great!  </li>
      <li>and this works perfectly for him</li>
      <li>for the hold that this wax provides, I&#x27;d say it was marginal at best.</li>
      <li>Holds well, smells great!</li>
      <li>the brown works great.  </li>
      <li>but it works great.</li>
      <li>The brown is great for giving a bit of &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; color to thicken up the look.</li>
      <li>Great price I use every morning</li>
      <li>Great value in the multi pack</li>
      <li>LoL</li>
      <li>(Rather pleasant when I go to kiss his face).</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my husband, we find this is easily the best wax on the market for holding a style in your mustache!</li>
      <li>I do have to apply quite a bit for a good hold</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, it holds up well during sports and sweating.  </li>
      <li>My favorite mustache wax!</li>
      <li>it has a great scent and stay workable for a while and easily washes out</li>
      <li>Clear is universally awesome as well ^^!</li>
      <li>The best way for me to explain the wax is that it&#x27;s more like a really soft clay.</li>
      <li>Obviously satisfied with the performance of Clubman Pinaud.  </li>
      <li>I wish they would get a better cent.  </li>
      <li>I have been a user of Pinaud moustache wax for more than 30 years.  </li>
      <li>I used this for a couple of years before I found better, stronger, more manly moustache wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>FYI, make sure to check the tint.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years,I have also told my son about it,he also has been using it.</li>
      <li>First, when you want to have a good looking moustache and goatee, its important to have it looking sexy and not like a mountain man who has never heard of grooming.  </li>
      <li>I want to say how easy it was to return the product for a full refund and get the product that I needed!  </li>
      <li>As always, great product, holds the stash in perfect form, but the brown was the wrong color (I use the neutral)</li>
      <li>This is an easy to use wax that is water soluble.</li>
      <li>the brown tint works just fine.</li>
      <li>I purchase a three pack of this fine product, and it came sealed in a plastic bag.</li>
      <li>As a wax, it works just fine to hold my handlebar in place.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean up.</li>
      <li>Secondly, the brown wax is great for covering up the gray.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with the online radio station &amp;#34;WBCN: The Rock of Boston&amp;#34; He&#x27;s Billy, &amp;#34;The Stache&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>So be careful when hugging someone with a light colored shirt, and it s a good idea to wash your beard before going to bed</li>
      <li>/&gt;The comb/brush that comes with the wax is a nice touch, and the price is competitive, however if you&#x27;re looking for a good product to either style your mustache, or to not smell then entire time it is applied, and to not run down your mouth/face when there&#x27;s a light sprinkle, look somewhere else.</li>
      <li>lip caterpillar was a light color, and the brown wax did an admirable job transforming it into a much darker beast.</li>
      <li>This brown wax gives his stache a more uniform brown color, and it looks natural.</li>
      <li>The brown covers the grey nicely.</li>
      <li>Over the years, I have tried many other brands and wax bases, but always returned to this one as it appears, in my opinion, to maintain it&#x27;s original formula and performance for it&#x27;s intended purpose.  </li>
      <li>The brush/comb use to be a higher quality, but I purchase this moustache wax for it&#x27;s quality, ease of application, and durability.</li>
      <li>Brown is dark and easily gets on skin during application but luckily comes right off with water.  </li>
      <li>changes and holds the dark brown color nicely for extended wear</li>
      <li>If you have a large handlebar or unruly moustache, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I imagine that you could put it on thinner to deal with the color issue, but then you&#x27;re not going to get as much of a hold.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and my beard and mustache has always been a joke.  </li>
      <li>so it works really well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Leave Clubman to the womenfolk and get yourself a real wax...Firehouse or equivalent.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; more or less clumped together and stained my skin.</li>
      <li>Growing a mustache, and purchasing a mustache wax (with comb) was on my bucket list of things to do before I leave this mortal world; accordingly I scoured the internet looking for the correct wax for my newly grown flavor savor.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re wanting to try mustache wax for the first time, look no further.</li>
      <li>What was once light and nigh invisible, was now the color of a dark walnut cabinet.</li>
      <li>Coming upon clubman&#x27;s wax I noticed that it received decent reviews, but a common mention in many of the articles was the persistence of this odor emanating from this</li>
      <li>I like the quality of the stick with the Clubamn product, but this brown is super dark.</li>
      <li>Due to the fact that you&#x27;re putting this stuff right under your nose, be prepared to smell it for the duration of its application.</li>
      <li>I had desired to curl my mustache up, in preparation for the boxing match I was attending, however this wax was not firm enough to hold my stash up.</li>
      <li>The fragrence is a light minty smell, not at all unpleasant, but if you are tasting wine right after application it may interfere.</li>

<li> it smells  terrible  and  will stain  the skin around your ad stache  if your not careful</li>

    <li> The best way for me to explain the wax is that it&#x27;s more like a really soft clay. As it dries, it holds your moustache, but it&#x27;s not the strongest hold, and if it doesn&#x27;t match the color of your facial hair, it&#x27;s noticeable.  I imagine that you could put it on thinner to deal with the color issue, but then you&#x27;re not going to get as much of a hold.  If your moustache holds a handlebar well without any product, you could probably get away with this stuff. If you have a large handlebar or unruly moustache, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great price I use every morning</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and my beard and mustache has always been a joke.  I am almost 40 and I have been growing a goatee for the last 2 months.  I tried everything to get this under control.  This stuff works and looks great!  FYI, make sure to check the tint.  I have black hair but the brown tint works just fine.</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple of years before I found better, stronger, more manly moustache wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave Clubman to the womenfolk and get yourself a real wax...Firehouse or equivalent.</li>
    <li> I have been a user of Pinaud moustache wax for more than 30 years.  This was the first time that I ordered the wrong product (I use neutral, not brown!)  I want to say how easy it was to return the product for a full refund and get the product that I needed!  Kudos to Amazon and the product distributor!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 45 years to keep my handlebar moustache in check.  Obviously satisfied with the performance of Clubman Pinaud.  Over the years, I have tried many other brands and wax bases, but always returned to this one as it appears, in my opinion, to maintain it&#x27;s original formula and performance for it&#x27;s intended purpose.  The brush/comb use to be a higher quality, but I purchase this moustache wax for it&#x27;s quality, ease of application, and durability.</li>
    <li> The brown covers the grey nicely.</li>
    <li> The included brush broke within 30 seconds, not to mention it&#x27;s rather small and difficult for anyone with normal sized hands to hold. Maybe little people can use the brush, I dunno. The &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; more or less clumped together and stained my skin. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works as its supposed to work and covers my gray hair. Holds my moustache all day long.  Easy to clean up.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re wanting to try mustache wax for the first time, look no further. This is an easy to use wax that is water soluble. Try it out, then if you like it or find that you are ready to progress, move on to a hard wax. The tubing gets brittle and will likely break before you use all of the wax, especially if you roll up the end.</li>
    <li> Brown is dark and easily gets on skin during application but luckily comes right off with water.  Surprisingly, it holds up well during sports and sweating.  I do have to apply quite a bit for a good hold but it works great.</li>
    <li> As a wax, it works just fine to hold my handlebar in place.  But the brown color makes the wax like shoe polish - pain to get off your fingertips or face (or you smear a tad).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years,I have also told my son about it,he also has been using it.</li>
    <li> do not buy  this. it smells  terrible  and  will stain  the skin around your ad stache  if your not careful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like wiping brown paint on your mustache with no hold at all. Hate it. It smeared all over my fingers and face.</li>
    <li> My husband is a military aviator and they have a tradition with mustache March or for when they deploy. This product is a must for taming the stache to look less scary and more debonair! LoL Great value in the multi pack so he can have one for home, one for his gym back and a spare for travel.</li>
    <li> changes and holds the dark brown color nicely for extended wear</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product because he has a long mustache  and he like to twist the ends up and this works perfectly for him</li>
    <li> I like the quality of the stick with the Clubamn product, but this brown is super dark. Too dark for my beard without looking phony. The fragrence is a light minty smell, not at all unpleasant, but if you are tasting wine right after application it may interfere. I ended up buying the neutral wax. Can&#x27;t knock the product for being darker than I expected.</li>
    <li> As always, great product, holds the stash in perfect form, but the brown was the wrong color (I use the neutral) so return to stock, this was.</li>
    <li> I am a recently mustacheo&#x27;d individual. Growing a mustache, and purchasing a mustache wax (with comb) was on my bucket list of things to do before I leave this mortal world; accordingly I scoured the internet looking for the correct wax for my newly grown flavor savor. Coming upon clubman&#x27;s wax I noticed that it received decent reviews, but a common mention in many of the articles was the persistence of this odor emanating from this wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smell should not be underestimated. Due to the fact that you&#x27;re putting this stuff right under your nose, be prepared to smell it for the duration of its application. It is a pungent chemical-y smell, that is not altogether off-putting, but quite distasteful. Take this into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lip caterpillar was a light color, and the brown wax did an admirable job transforming it into a much darker beast. What was once light and nigh invisible, was now the color of a dark walnut cabinet. Other reviewers had mentioned a redish tint, however there was none to be found in my stash. To compare color, think of a very dark walnut, that has already been finished (with shellac or some other finishing product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the hold that this wax provides, I&#x27;d say it was marginal at best. I had desired to curl my mustache up, in preparation for the boxing match I was attending, however this wax was not firm enough to hold my stash up. I would recommend a different product if styling is what you have in mind. Additionally, this product is water soluble. So, come prepared for some ridicule if you get rained on as it will run down your mouth and like cinderella, you&#x27;ll return to the lesser state you once were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb/brush that comes with the wax is a nice touch, and the price is competitive, however if you&#x27;re looking for a good product to either style your mustache, or to not smell then entire time it is applied, and to not run down your mouth/face when there&#x27;s a light sprinkle, look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend (who has a curled mustache) was using the regular version of this stuff &amp; it kept leaving a white residue. He recently started using it in brown, and he loves it. He&#x27;s actually upset at himself for not ordering the brown sooner. The hair on his head is black, but his facial hair grows in brown with a bit of red. This brown wax gives his stache a more uniform brown color, and it looks natural. And it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it actually smells a little bit like cereal when he first puts it on. (Rather pleasant when I go to kiss his face). He&#x27;s been curling his mustache for years, and he&#x27;ll only use this brand. If you&#x27;re familiar with the online radio station &amp;#34;WBCN: The Rock of Boston&amp;#34; He&#x27;s Billy, &amp;#34;The Stache&amp;#34;. You can see pictures of this mustachioed marvel on WBCN&#x27;s facebook.  I ordered the product on Sun. 4/14 and received it by Fri 4/19.</li>
    <li> I purchase a three pack of this fine product, and it came sealed in a plastic bag. I noticed AFTER I had opened the bag that one of the containers was opened and the product was NOT in the plastic bag. Because I had already opened the bag, there was not recourse. I call SHENANIGANS!</li>
    <li> My favorite mustache wax! Holds well, smells great!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for two reasons.  First, when you want to have a good looking moustache and goatee, its important to have it looking sexy and not like a mountain man who has never heard of grooming.  This product gives that effect.  The whiskers look neat and groomed.  Secondly, the brown wax is great for covering up the gray. Because it just &amp;#34;sits&amp;#34; on the hairs there are lots of color variations and not one drab &amp;#34;dyed&amp;#34; look like you get with the beard dyes.  I have about 30% gray in the beard so it works really well.  If it were all gray, it probably wouldn&#x27;t.  The only thing to remember about the colored wax is, it rubs off.  So be careful when hugging someone with a light colored shirt, and it s a good idea to wash your beard before going to bed so it doesn&#x27;t rub off on the pillowcase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, we find this is easily the best wax on the market for holding a style in your mustache! The brown is great for giving a bit of &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; color to thicken up the look. Clear is universally awesome as well ^^! This is the product to use if you style everyday.</li>
    <li> I have always like to use clubman on the curls of my mustache but hated the white color neutral leaves on my hair.  the brown works great.  I wish they would get a better cent.  I also use ebarber shop brown it has a great scent and stay workable for a while and easily washes out it works well with this product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product, he has tried others and none has come close. I usually order about 4 at a time and they last him all year!</li>
