      <li>You can hear the sound of plastic rubbing against plastic.</li>
      <li>it goes on really smooth, and the smudge end also helps to smooth it out.  </li>
      <li>Absolutly Fabulous.</li>
      <li>Glides on smooth and effortlessly, like liquid liner.</li>
      <li>That way it is not a mad dash to the store when I run out!</li>
      <li>Was only good for two uses like it was to try out and cost as much as a full one would, never buying again!</li>
      <li>Drug store general eyeliners are just as good</li>
      <li>Goes on easily and lasts pretty well.</li>
      <li>It can not make a fine line because the tip is very broad (5mm) and the color doesn&#x27;t easily stick to the skin.</li>
      <li>Glad amazon offers it.</li>
      <li>good price for the product compared to what I would normally pay in the local stores.</li>
      <li>I really like the color and thickness of this liner, but it smudges quickly.</li>
      <li>Love this brand and product, it comes on really easily not having to cover layer like most eyeliners.</li>
      <li>It is simple and goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>Every time I have used it I have ended up looking like a raccoon, even though I have sparingly lined only my top lashes.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for the first time.</li>
      <li>Better color and quality than regular pencil liner.</li>
      <li>It came in a pretty box.</li>
      <li>Nice eye liner with a smudge brush on the other end.</li>
      <li>My eyes get irritated easily and this is the only once that doesn&#x27;t do it</li>
      <li>I really like the Cover Girl Eye Liners because they do last all day and are easy to go on</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and last all day.</li>
      <li>product itself is very creamy.</li>
      <li>I really expected more from Covergirl .The</li>
      <li>and you do not have to sharpen, fast and convenient.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just too soft!!!</li>
      <li>Lastly, it also smudges easily and comes right off with just a bare touch of your fingers.  </li>
      <li>I like this mascara, but it smudges throughout the day and I am constantly wiping my eyes clean from the smudge.</li>
      <li>I have typically used CG&#x27;s self-sharpening pencil (which I thought this was) and had much better luck.</li>
      <li>I use it on my water line mainly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>It is okay does not last that long</li>
      <li>but it works fine, not great, but fine.</li>
      <li>This is versatile enough for office and evening, just apply less or more as needed.</li>
      <li>I do not know about lasting power yet since I only got it today and quickly put it on to try it out.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner, it&#x27;s so convenient because you never have to worry about sharpening it, and it&#x27;s not as hard to use as those liquid eyeliners.</li>
      <li>I like it, a little smudgy but a good basic black eyeliner.</li>
      <li>When I first got this eyeliner, I wanted to see what the tip looked like, so I turned the bottom knob, but upon trying to turn it back, the stuff wouldn&#x27;t go back in!!!</li>
      <li>Covergirl is brand name and should live up to that  standard.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that you don&#x27;t get as much of it compared to a regular eyeliner pencil.</li>
      <li>I find it much easier to buy them on here when I am low getting low, or even stock up with an extra.</li>
      <li>Too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and does not dry.</li>
      <li>On top of that the color (black onyx) is dull and lifeless.</li>

<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the formula, color or type of pencil but avoid this one at all costs!</li>
<li> It stays on all day over my primer and eyeshadow, and it allows you to make thick or thin lines.  </li>
<li> Broken..</li>
<li> and allows you to make thick OR thin lines!</li>
<li> Needless to say, I will never use this again</li>

    <li> I like this mascara, but it smudges throughout the day and I am constantly wiping my eyes clean from the smudge.</li>
    <li> Only eyeliner I use. This is versatile enough for office and evening, just apply less or more as needed. My eyes get irritated easily and this is the only once that doesn&#x27;t do it</li>
    <li> These are my favorite eyeliner crayons and I have been using them for years! I find it much easier to buy them on here when I am low getting low, or even stock up with an extra. That way it is not a mad dash to the store when I run out!</li>
    <li> The product does not glide on or having any staying power.</li>
    <li> Glides on smooth and effortlessly, like liquid liner.</li>
    <li> Omg love love love! I purchased this for the first time. So cheap, amazing quality and it comes with two when you buy one! It came in a pretty box. I love it! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this eye liner!  it goes on really smooth, and the smudge end also helps to smooth it out.  It stays on all day over my primer and eyeshadow, and it allows you to make thick or thin lines.  Depending on the eyeshadow, it looks darker or lighter shades of black. Overall, i would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Broken..Eyeliner doesn&#x27;t twist up :-(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay like I want it to.  It smudges really easily.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it!!</li>
    <li> Not for me. It runs. Don&#x27;t like having raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> This color transfers on contact. When I open my eyes the liner makes contact with my upper lid creating a double line.</li>
    <li> Smudges extremely easily.  Too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and does not dry. Lower quality than any other CoverGirl Eyeliner I have used.</li>
    <li> I love this Eye Liner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easy (no tugging!) and allows you to make thick OR thin lines! Plus it was only $3 and change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is it fades late in the evening, but I&#x27;m usually in for the night or making up to go out - so it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> Nice eye liner with a smudge brush on the other end. Line can be thicker than a gel liner though. I use it on my water line mainly.</li>
    <li> This is some of my favorite eyeliner. It will smear if you rub it, but I don&#x27;t like dark, sharp lines. I love the smudge brush on the end so I can get the perfect smokey eye.</li>
    <li> good price for the product compared to what I would normally pay in the local stores. Do subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. So glad it is available on Amazon. I don&#x27;t wear makeup much but when I have a Date or Event that requires a little effort - this is my go to Eye liner. It is simple and goes on very smoothly. It lasts forever for me! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner, it&#x27;s so convenient because you never have to worry about sharpening it, and it&#x27;s not as hard to use as those liquid eyeliners. The only downside is that you don&#x27;t get as much of it compared to a regular eyeliner pencil. But it&#x27;s so easy to use, I&#x27;ll never switch.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even with coupon.  Goes on smooth and last all day.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner doesnt stay on all day.  By the time i get home from work it is smeared under my eyes.  It goes on easy though.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Easy to apply and lasts all day.  Glad amazon offers it.</li>
    <li> I really like the color and thickness of this liner, but it smudges quickly. I tried using primer and setting it with eyeshadow and powder and while it cut down on the smudging quite a bit, it still smudged a little. If I could give 2.5 stars I would - love the thickness, hate the smudging.</li>
    <li> Was only good for two uses like it was to try out and cost as much as a full one would, never buying again!</li>
    <li> Tip kept breaking off everytime I tried to use it.  Super frustrating and I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, love, this eyeliner.  Love the price even more on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Goes on easily and lasts pretty well.</li>
    <li> It is okay does not last that long</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.  It looks great and the tip is fine so you can get close to the lid.  I think it last long and doesn&#x27;t smear like my last liner did.  I would buy it again.  I love the nonsharpening tip too.</li>
    <li> Great liner and love the smudging end. Works perfect for the smokey eye look.</li>
    <li> Covergirl is my All Time Favorite Brand, As soon as I tried the pencil i was in amazement! The pencil is retractable, glides on smoothly, Most Of All- Shows Colour &amp; and Stays put! Absolutly Fabulous.</li>
    <li> I like it, a little smudgy but a good basic black eyeliner. Nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> so smudgy!  I always have smudge under and beside my eye by mid day.  I have been told twice that I have smudge under my eye. Embarrassing.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product. I like the covergirl  brand but this eyeliner does not work. It can not make a fine line because the tip is very broad (5mm) and the color doesn&#x27;t easily stick to the skin. On top of that the color (black onyx) is dull and lifeless. Lastly, it also smudges easily and comes right off with just a bare touch of your fingers.  I have one dollar eye pencils that work better than this.  This one can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be used.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these (at the same time) through the Subscribe and Save program. Neither one of them worked as the mechanism would not advance the eyeliner in the tube. I have used the CG Perfect Point eyeliner, which looks identical to this one, for years but always purchased them in a store. I never had a problem with those. This eyeliner was junk and I cancelled my subscription.</li>
    <li> The plastic tip was bent so when I retracted the product, it would click and no product would come out. You can hear the sound of plastic rubbing against plastic. I have to keep retracting it for it to come out just a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very creamy. It easily blends out if you want it to. I do not know about lasting power yet since I only got it today and quickly put it on to try it out.</li>
    <li> Love this brand and product, it comes on really easily not having to cover layer like most eyeliners. And especially better deal for the price. I prefer this over the Revlon brand eyeliner. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Bought 3 and one didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I really like the Cover Girl Eye Liners because they do last all day and are easy to go on and you do not have to sharpen, fast and convenient.</li>
    <li> Glided on alright but did not stay on. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> For a girl who doesn&#x27;t use makeup very often, I believe is a good product, not the best but it works fine, not great, but fine.</li>
    <li> I really expected more from Covergirl .The quality is a bit sub par. It is definitely over priced. Would not purchase this again. Covergirl is brand name and should live up to that  standard. Drug store general eyeliners are just as good</li>
    <li> It was good I love it</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the worst eyeliner I have ever used! Every time I have used it I have ended up looking like a raccoon, even though I have sparingly lined only my top lashes. Needless to say, I will never use this again so it&#x27;s money wasted. Save yourself and find something else! I have typically used CG&#x27;s self-sharpening pencil (which I thought this was) and had much better luck. Not sure if it&#x27;s the formula, color or type of pencil but avoid this one at all costs!</li>
    <li> When I first got this eyeliner, I wanted to see what the tip looked like, so I turned the bottom knob, but upon trying to turn it back, the stuff wouldn&#x27;t go back in!!! The tip just broke off like that!!! It smudged everywhere and I had already wasted half of it trying to put it on for the first time! It&#x27;s just too soft!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner, it&#x27;s rare when I truly subscribe and save an item, but this is a must have! Better color and quality than regular pencil liner.</li>
    <li> I will never buy this eyeliner again it doesn&#x27;t even stay  30 minutes it&#x27;s smears all over I don&#x27;t like it at all.😒😒😒</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product and like the fact that it is self-sharpening.</li>
    <li> Nothing was inside of mines</li>
    <li> Very pleased with how smooth the eyeliner goes on. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye liner I have used for years. Once I found it I fell in love with it. Even with my allergy&#x27;s I have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> Just what recipient needed.</li>
