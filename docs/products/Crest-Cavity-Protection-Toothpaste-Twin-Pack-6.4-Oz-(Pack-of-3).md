    <li> Been using crest for YEARS.  Don&#x27;t care for other products when cleaning teeth</li>
    <li> To qualify for free shipping, I had to order enought toothpaste to last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> best way to buy tooth paste for families. No running around to stores looking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Crest toothpaste, need I say more?</li>
    <li> Fantastic Product. I&#x27;ve used natural toothpaste for years, including &amp;#34;Earthpaste&amp;#34; and tooth soap, and I HATE tooth powder! When I came back to Crest, I could not believe what I had been missing. I have braces and this toothpaste has helped me maintain healthy teeth by looking/feeling stronger. It strengthens enamel without being bombarded by extra harsh chemicals in other toothpastes. (Although it may take some people longer to notice a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; effect.) The flavor is very mild and not very strong at all. I&#x27;ve tried every herbal toothpaste you can imagine. They may taste good but they leave my teeth looking really yellow over time. So I recommend this to anyone, especially for people on braces. I&#x27;m also alternating with Crest Citrus Splash. They&#x27;re both my favorite flavors but this wins out over all others for quality and taste.</li>
    <li> Crest is Crest.  You can&#x27;t go wrong and better prices than at local retailers.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste leaves mouth feeling clean and fresh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve being used many fancy tooth pastes that clean, brighten, protect, and many more adjective but all you need is this plain old tooth paste and you will have a better smile, healthy gums and stronger teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andre</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste, works good, tastes good and I get six tubes of it. Should last awhile and it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Keeps my teeth sparkly clean. Also this is like three pounds of toothpaste...</li>
    <li> best toothpaste good price will buy again</li>
    <li> this is the regular paste. no whitening no nothing. taste like cheap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over 10 years and it has definitely helped prevent cavities.  I actually had a \\&quot;soft spot\\&quot; the dentist was keeping an eye on so I made sure to brush twice a day instead of my lazy once and by using this toothpaste, my \\&quot;soft spot\\&quot; actually went away and I&#x27;ve had no issues since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If price isn&#x27;t an option, order it here... but if you care about price, check your local Walmart.  Mine carries the 2-pack for $4.00 which gets you 6 packages at $12.00 instead of $17.27 that&#x27;s listed here.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. Really feel clean and fresh breath after brushing with Crest. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> well i used this toothpaste when i was at my cousins house for a week, its pretty average and only fights cavities thats it doesnt do anything else...    i would rate this 3 stars because the average person has tartar formations and plaque biofilm forming everyday and people need toothpaste to fight that or remove that bacterium     yeah you can be cavity free but at what cost? you&#x27;re still expected to get tartar and bad breath    i would recommend this if you were to go on a vacation or if you&#x27;re traveling around the world</li>
    <li> wow my teeth are so white when i smile now after using this I almost need to use sunglasses with these.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Try this item :)</li>
    <li> I misread the title when buying. I thought this was 3 tubes of toothpaste, but its 3 packs of twins, so i got 6 tubes. i love it.</li>
    <li> Lots of toothpaste for a good price.  Hard to find the original Crest anymore so this worked for me.</li>
    <li> Of all the zillions of toothpastes to choose from, in the end, I like the one that&#x27;s been around for years and years.  I prefer ordering it online because it&#x27;s overwhelming to have hundreds of choices and sizes at the supermarket.</li>
    <li> Like this product. Good price.</li>
    <li> Definitely increases my gum health by the massage action which flossing does not do. Some of the reviews gives you actual dental numbers of gum health. They state their gum numbers at the dentist improved from 5&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s to 2&#x27;s and 3&#x27;s (lower is better). I fully believe that. When I went back to the dentist after a few months of using the water flosser the dentist found virtually no tarter or plague on or between my teeth. Normally it is a good bit of very uncomfortable scraping but not after the water flosser.</li>
    <li> product as described shipped quickly</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  crest. You can&#x27;t go wrong. I feel this was a good deal as i hate going to the store.</li>
    <li> Great product... arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I&#x27;ve used Crest all my life (54 years) and have had only 2 or 3 cavities in all that time.  What can I say, I&#x27;m a happy Crest user.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste every day. There is no sensitivity of tooth enamel with prolonged use. Excellent price for a large volume and a large number of tubes.</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping to keep the cavities away along with flossing, Waterpicing, anti-plaque rince, brush teeth with Crest anti-cavity, anti-cavity rince, Cleanings at the dentist office every three months.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste. nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> I use this as part of a pretty intense mouth cleaning routine. I love this toothpaste. It simple and great tasting.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY toothpaste I buy. I love how clean it makes my teeth feel!</li>
    <li> Nothing special.Good toothpaste for daily using. Great value for big family. This toothpaste is simple and has good taste. Like it.</li>
    <li> After almost sixty years on grocery and drug store shelves, Crest continues to be a favorite.</li>
    <li> This tastes like root beer.</li>
    <li> I always buy in quantity to get a better deal.  Crest is a great toothpaste and I&#x27;m happy with the price.</li>
    <li> To clear up possible confusion, I received three twin-packs, six tubes in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the most basic of toothpaste, so Crest&#x27;s Cavity Protection is perfect.</li>
    <li> An old staple in our house!</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste. (I guess. Does anyone really ever notice a difference in toothpastes? I mean, aside from gel vs. paste or different flavors? Don&#x27;t they all do the same in preventing those pesky dental visits?)</li>
