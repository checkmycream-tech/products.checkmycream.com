    <li> Works wonders to tame frizz and smells great!</li>
    <li> Neuma Argan oil is a lovely hair condition to apply to dry hair for just a little extra shine.  I would recommend it especially for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This oil has worked wonders on my thick, dry and curly hair.  A stylist fried my hair when doing highlights and I was resigned to either cutting it all off immediately or looking like a Brillo pad for the next 6-12 months.  I had tried EVERYTHING I could think of, including coconut oil, to put some life back into my locks, to no avail.  Then my NEW stylist gave me a sample of this incredible oil and -- WOWZA!!! -- my hair was transformed.  I used a couple of drops on my damp hair and let it air dry.  I have shine and soft gorgeous curls again!  I will never be without this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing silky hair with this product.  I liked it so much, I bought 6 bottles to give as Xmas gifts.</li>
    <li> I like this product - but dont like the spray dispenser. I just take off the top and pour out.  4 stars because of container design.</li>
    <li> provides moisture and creates shine to hair</li>
    <li> This product is perfect. I love that it&#x27;s clear because amber toned argan oils tend to change the color of my highlights. It&#x27;s not too greasy and his my hair look healthy especially on the ends</li>
    <li> Like this Neuma Argan oil.  Just make sure to only use a drop on short hair or it will make it  look oily</li>
    <li> This was part of a package I purchased and I really love it.  Not something I might buy usually, but it is now part of my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, she says it’s terrific! She loves using this especially on rainy, frizzy hair days- this stuff is magic!</li>
    <li> Great on course hair as well as being organic and a little goes a very long way in its use</li>
    <li> Though expensive, this is AMAZING. My hair was dry, the curls were not curls, and my hair was just dead. I changed shampoos and just need after wash treatment. Use very little, all that is needed. It goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My hair is very sensitive to humidity. I have not found anything that works well with it, I was hoping this product would but it did not.</li>
    <li> They used this at the salon and I didn&#x27;t want to buy a large bottle so I purchashed this one from Amazon. If you have heavy hair or don&#x27;t wash it every day this product helps keep your hair looking fresh, plus it has a great smell and texture to the product and little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this! I use it on my hair when its damp before blow drying, and when my hair is dry as a finisher and my hair is so soft and shiney. I got a sample and had to buy more as my hair has heat damage and this smoooothes it for daily styling and the Argan is preventing further damage!</li>
    <li> I really like this for extra moisture. Helps keep hair soft and smooth. Works well to control frizz and static. Does take a lot thought</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I have very fine hair and it does not make it greasy or weigh it down.  It leaves my hair shiny and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;Love this treatment and will buy again!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for detangling hair. it makes it smooth and shiny! we use it daily and it saves us many tears</li>
    <li> Revives and protects my hair and makes it feel better and leaves a nice shine.  I use just one pump along with my styling gel and I&#x27;m ready to blow dry.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this better than other argon treatments.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I will be ordering it again. It makes my hair soft and shiny and it does what it says in its product description. Very happy with it.</li>
