<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Braun claims the foils should last for 12-18 months.  It is more like 6 months before it develops a hole in the foil.  While the foil is intact, it works great.</li>
    <li> greta but very expensive, I am looking to buy a new one but keep waiting until the last min to see if that will be on sale, but it&#x27;s never happening :(</li>
    <li> The cutter  block was sent very fast and was an excellent fit for the razor.</li>
    <li> It took longer than expected to get it via gound shipping. But I finally got it.</li>
    <li> No surprises was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for about 40 years .. Braun is the best of the best .. The self clean system and superb cutting head leaves nothing to do but pick it up and shave .. And the shave is so smooooooth ...</li>
    <li> I read all the mixed reviews about the replacement foil &amp; cutter for my model 8985 Braun.  I decided to go with the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation.  I compared the cutter with the one I was replacing &amp; they looked identical.  After using the 51S Series 5 replacement set I have no complaints about the quality of the shaves.  You have to wonder why Braun would recommend an inferior replacement product.  I know that sometimes the original part is better than what replaces it but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case here. I recommend you use the Braun 8000 360 Complete Foil and Cutter Block for Models 8995, 8985 and 8975 shavers.</li>
    <li> this replacement head haas improved the performance of the shaver 100% I got at least 3 more days out ofa full charge.  so it is faster and closer.</li>
    <li> The Shaver head from amazon was the most econy I found shopping on the web. I am well pleased with the transaction. Sincerly, Tillman</li>
    <li> the new foil i received must be defective. i just put on the new blade and foil and the foil already has a hole in it. i used the original foil for quite some time before a hole appeared</li>
    <li> You do not realize just how dull your shaver can be until you replace it.  These items are not usually found out your local cvs or walgreens.  They fit my model perfect</li>
    <li> The replacement parts did make the shaver work like new again and were very easy to install. I avoid the cleaner solution replacement packs as they are a waste of money when you can just get isopropyl alcohol and clean the parts manually. The shaver works fine without incessant cleaning. Just remember, the foil and cutter are not really an option with this shaver; my foil tore apart and rendered the shaver useless (dangerous) until I got the new parts. Have a backup!</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for years and replaced this item every year, but this is the first time that I get one not made by Braun. It is definetely a great price but it does not perform like their original. It&#x27;s better to pay the extra few bucks and get the original.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find replacement heads for this particular model of BRAUN razor.  You have to look very closely at the model numbers.  Most stores carry another replacement model.  This was the only place I could find what I needed.  THANKS!</li>
    <li> Just replaced the foil and cutter block that came with my Braun 8975 electric shaver, after almost 14 months of daily use. The foil in the original had some breaks in it.  As soon as I used the replacement, I noticed how smooth the shaver felt on my face.  The User Guide indicates that the foil/cutter block should be changed after 18 months of use, but I had to do so sooner, perhaps because I press too hard when shaving.  If I want a really close shave, I wind up using my Gillette Fusion Power razor.  No matter how I twist and turn the Braun, I can&#x27;t seem to get as smooth a result on my neck, as I do on my face.  I do not have to use the razor every day.  I would say that my Braun 8975 is the best electric shaver that I ever had and I think that the foil/cutter block have a good deal to to with that conclusion.</li>
    <li> I should have replaced the cutter block and foil about a half year sooner.  The razor has me back to being smoother than the dull cutter and foil arrangement offered though it wasn&#x27;t really all that bad.  The new cutter and foil takes less time to get a finished shave.  Is worth the time reclaimed but think the price is a bit of a heave.</li>
    <li> After replacing the foil and blade the razor cut much better and was also less irritating. I would definitely recommend replacing this part. I wish it lasted longer though.</li>
    <li> After 18 plus months using this razor, I had to get another set of blades.  It&#x27;s a great razor, and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> What can i say: it&#x27;s a shaver foil ! but it works well - smmooooth ;)</li>
    <li> The product does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and does it well; only thing is, it leaves a dirty, black smeared stain wherever you shave.  Therefore, if you decide to put up with that and keep it for whatever reason, you&#x27;d have to just wash it off afterwards or perhaps shave before you shower.</li>
    <li> The new cutter head and foil for my Braun shaver makes it work like new!    Thanks1</li>
    <li> Received a Series 7 foil and cutter block instead of series 5</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how bad my shaver was getting - this helped bring it back to life!</li>
    <li> The Braun razor is the best I have ever used, The cutter head assembly recently ordered performed exactly as specificed. I probably should have ordered it earlier.</li>
    <li> I bought the pack on amazon from this vendor for my 8985. When installed, it didn&#x27;t seem to fit perfectly as the original one. When shaving, you can tell it is not close to the skin as before.    I shave everyday. 3 months later, some areas of my neck I shave started to feel itchy and painful at times, esp. when shaving. After awhile, I notice that the foil has 2 holes on it. HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN FOR ONLY 3 MONTHS?    I still miss the original one comes w/ the shaver, close, smooth and lasted for 2 years.    I bought this pack for the price but now I am going to thrown in 50% more to get it in store. Let&#x27;s see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Braun 8000 360 Complete Foil and Cutter Block for Models 8995, 8985 and 8975    Great product!</li>
    <li> Naturally, this item is a perfect fit on the Braun 360. I picked out the razor system itself because they recommend changing the foil and block every 18 months. I have replaced it three times in the last year. The foil has small perforations to push your hair into the trimming area...which is great... until some of the metal pieces of the foil break off and those small perforations start combining to get larger and larger. My face has been sliced up by the cutter block several times from this razor when this happens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun 8595 for 5 years.  I LOVED MY BRAUN!!! It was worth every penny of the original purchase price, and the cost of previous replacement foils.  I went to buy my third set of replacement foils to discover the Model 8000 Activator, the original shaver foil and cutter block, had been discontinued and replaced with the 360* Complete, so I bought that.  Braun had been great, and never let me down before.    I have fairly tough skin, but this new head caused horrible, painful razor burn.  It&#x27;s the worst on the neck, but it causes it everywhere.  Rather than simply cutting the hair as I moved the razor across my face like the original foils had, the new one grabs my skin and hair and drags them along before finally cutting.  As a result of the painful dragging of the skin and hair before eventually cutting it, the shave is not as close since it isn&#x27;t cutting the hair straight on as the razor with the original foils did.  Now it hurts to get a lousy shave.    Braun must want us to buy the new Pulsonic, but I&#x27;m not falling for it.  They&#x27;ll just mess up the foil and cutter again once a newer razor comes out.</li>
    <li> Right on the first day, I was not at all impressed with the performance. I had started using it after couple of months of receiving it. So couldn&#x27;t even return it. I feel it&#x27;s just not worth buying it.</li>
    <li> I waited a while to replace the cutter block on my razor because I am a cheapskate. After replacing it, the shave became much more comfortable.  I forgot how nice the razor was when I bought it.  Replace the cutter block, you will notice the difference!</li>
    <li> As mentioned over and over, not as good as the original part that came with the 8000 360 series razor, but it works.  Pulls more, but it cuts OK.  Well see how long it lasts.  If this is our only choice, to buy the lesser model razor head for an upper level razor (and really, the razor head is what makes the razor), then I guess my next razor will not be a Braun... Braun, are you listening?  This downgrade is not OK.</li>
    <li> Great product and does exactly what it says.  This is the second time i purchased this foil / blade cutters.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I own an 8985 and it had been in desperate need of a replacement foil and cutter for some time.  I hesitated spending the $35 or so since I had read so many bad reviews.  Glad I waited, because I finally read a couple of reviews that suggested buying the (still) German made 30B replacement.  Although it&#x27;s not listed as the correct item and it seemed a little chancy, I went ahead and bought one.  Works like a dream!  There was such an enormous difference, I just bought two more before they start manufacturing the 30B in China too (I don&#x27;t personally know for a fact if the \\&quot;correct\\&quot; replacement is made there since I haven&#x27;t bought one).  Don&#x27;t take a chance. Buy the 30B at $21 each with Prime free shipping.  Thanks for the advice to those who tried this out first!</li>
    <li> Have used this razor for two years and now have had to replace the foil and blades, which is routine for this time of razor.  I find this razor works very well, better than any other model I have used in the past.  People seem to be either a rotary or foil user, and I believe this model is worth the price.  No electric razor shaves as close as a blade, but this one does a great job.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Had a customer service issue as my product was damaged in shipping. They jumped right on it and reshipped a new product right away. I was impressed. Anyone can just fill order but this company really stands behind what they sell. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s becoming rare these days.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Braun 360 Complete as a replacement part for my Braun Shaver. It came in new manufacturer&#x27;s packaging (hard to open) and within the minimum time from when I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Braun shaver for 2 or 3 years. It gave a great shave, but gradually and imperceptably the quality of the shave declined.  It was taking longer to shave and even then it wasn&#x27;t that great a result. Well, DUH! The blades had blunted after literally 100s of shaves. Foolishly, it never dawned on me to think about replacing the blades, until I finally read the note on the box of cleaning liquid.  I ordered the Foil &amp; Cutter Block from Amazon and it arrived quickly. I&#x27;m not at all techy so I wondered if I&#x27;d have trouble fiddling with tiny screwdrivers etc. No need to worry; you simply pull off the old one, pop on the new one, snap on the new foil cover and start shaving.  I noticed the difference immediately. A much cleaner, quicker shave. If you own a Braun shaver and haven&#x27;t replaced the cutter in 12+ months, I strongly suggest you do it now.  It&#x27;s like getting a brand new shaver.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the info on the 30B trick. I have had my 8985 for a long, long, time. 5 years? I have been temped to upgrade several times but keep seeing the same problems and high prices. I purchased a new foil kit last year about this time and the shaver went like new. I threw out the cleaning system long ago. I just bang it on the side of the sink every time to clean it. Might be wrong but I&#x27;ve been doing that for years. The new replacement foil set lasted about 6 months then came apart prematurely so some superglue fixed that. I am going to try the 3B trick stated above and see what happens. I think the prices for new shavers and foils are crazy. I&#x27;ll keep my old shaver until I hit the jackpot and can waste money. Manufactures please quit playing games. The model number that changes by 1 or 2 digits is still the same machine and we are not fooled when you sell dif. model numbers to different stores so they don&#x27;t have to price match. Thanks for the advice.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a 8995 model, 360 Complete, 8000 Series, silver top.  The new cutter replacement is exactly the same.  It has \\&quot;fat blades\\&quot;  that are close to each other.  Just like the old one.  However, the foil pattern is different.  The new foil replacement has a regular pattern with similar sized holes, while  the old foil had an irregular pattern with varying sized holes.  But, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference when shaving.  Be wary of the comments on here about 30B.  I do not recommend buying the 30B for this model type.  The 30B has \\&quot;thin blades\\&quot; that are far apart from each other.  And the top is black, not silver.  I had the unfortunate experience of buying this replacement too, and it butchered my face.  Should have ignored these comments and bought this one first.</li>
    <li> If you like your Braun Series 8000 Shaver this Braun Foil and Cutter Block replacement will give you a closer shave.  I change the foil and blades about every 12 months.  The downside is, there are no other choices available accept to buy a new shaver.  I own a Norelco and a Braun and like the Braun slightly better.  Shavers are pretty personal, either you like a brand and it works for you or you don&#x27;t.  This foil and blade replacement set is fairly expensive and you will save a bit by shopping on-line.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and cutter block turned out to be at least as good as the original, maybe even better and a snap to replace.</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter block were exactly as described, however Amazon shipped me an empty box with another customer&#x27;s packing slip inside. Customer service had trouble expalining this occurrence and the situation had to be escalated to a customer service supervisor who finally sent me the item I ordered. Amazon was unable to explain how I received a strangers packing slip for a \\&quot;hydraulic pump\\&quot; sent to me in an empy box. At least they corrected the problem with courtesy.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly, definitely improves shaving, my older blades were about 2 years old, can feel the difference</li>
    <li> The Braun 8000 was a birthday gift last year and it is an awesome shaver.  Original foil and cutter last over a year.</li>
    <li> Product was new, as descibed, and was shipped promptly.  Saved a few dollars over the price at Walmart with the free shipping.  I love   Amazon!</li>
    <li> These foils and cutters are great and easy to replace.  For the cost of 3 of them, you can buy a new razor, but the 360 is one of the better razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I purchased the listed product for my Braun 8985 shaver that is fantastic!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil and cutter came very quickly and was brand new!!  My Braun is like new now and is great on the whiskers!!</li>
    <li> Sooner or later you&#x27;ll need one of these if you have the Braun razor.  And it DOES make a difference in shaving comfort.  The manufacturer recommends changing the head every 18 months.  My razor got dropped &amp; didn&#x27;t seem to shave me as well.  A change of the head and it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in a timely fashion as expected.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and cutter block do exactly what they are supposed to do - make your Braun shaver feel like new.  And there&#x27;s no shave more comfortable than a New Braun Electric.</li>
    <li> Braun 8000 360 Complete Model 8995 Razor has exceeded all of my expectations of an electric razor. I have never had a smooth shave from any electric razor before but after one week of using this razor I am getting a smooth shave. Thanks Rob</li>
    <li> THE ENTIRE BRAUN 8000 LINE IS OUTSTANDING. IT PROVIDES A VERY GOOD SMOOTH SHAVE. I HAVE ONLY TWO PROBLEMS WITH IT. FIRST IS THE $40.00 PRICE FOR THE REPLACEMENT FOIL &amp; CUTTER. SECOND BRAUN CLAIMS THAT THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE FOIL  &amp; CUTTER IS 18 MONTHS. IN MY EXPERIENCE THE FOIL &amp; CUTTER LASTED ONLY 9 MONTHS BEFORE I HAD TO GET A REPLACEMENT. WHAT DID THEY DO? TEST THE SHAVER ON BLOND SMOOTH SKINNED TEENAGERS. ALL IN ALL I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE BRAUN&#x27;S 8995 MODEL SHAVER FOIL &amp; CUTTER. COMPARED TO WHAT IS CURRENTLY OUT ON THE MARKET IT IS THE BEST. A NEW YORK BRAVO TO BRAUN. JUST TRY TO WORK ON THE ITEMS I MENTIONED: MORE COMPETITIVE PRICING AND IMPROVED QUALITY ON THE FOIL/CUTTER. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because once I pushed the previous foil onto the shaver and did not fully seat it.  Running the shaver ruined the foil and is hard on the face.  Have extra foils.</li>
    <li> This is the cutter and foil for the Braun 8000 360 series.  I highly recommend this for people that shave their head, no nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> Following the Braun company recommendation, at the 18th month mark, I changed out the screen and blade block. The Gillette blade block was an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;, I can really notice the difference. Further, this was the lowest price for this product that I found.</li>
    <li> Well made replacement blade and foil.  A little pricey, but then all the replacement blades and foils are pricey.</li>
    <li> Gives a very clean shave, but need to be careful when taking the foil on and off, I cracked the plastic taking it off.</li>
    <li> My old Series 3 needed a new foil.  So bought from Boots foil and cutter labelled Series 3. Twenty-five pounds worth.  Foil does not fit - there&#x27;s been a small design change, but it looks identical until you unpack and try it.  More care is needed from Braun in packaging and coding.  Writing this in irritation as I have spent half an hour on phone.  UK service agent not able to help, and I&#x27;m going round the houses with automated answering and tied-up help lines at Braun HQ.  And I need a shave.</li>
    <li> Braun says that these blades work with the 8595 that I use. While it&#x27;s true that the blades do fit and the razor will operate, the level of razor burn is OFF THE SCALE compared to the Activator blades. The best thing about the Braun system is the minimal to non-existent razor burn, an advantage that is completely lost with these. If you use an 8595, avoid these blades like the plague. (Frankly, I would assume that these blades would cause the same problems with other Braun razors, but I can&#x27;t say for sure since all I have is an 8595.)</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in a timely fashion and was exactly what I was looking for.  What else can you ask for?  Excellent service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun 8975 model for almost 2 years.  I&#x27;m very happy that I bought although it wasn&#x27;t a cheap purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement head to my Braum electric. Just like the old one, only fresh and sharp like a new one.</li>
    <li> Title says it all -- they don&#x27;t seem to steer the defective parts to the replacement market, as some industries do. Good parts.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered it. But now I wished I just got a different shaver. The blade is not as comfortable. It feels like it&#x27;s pulling and yet it misses hairs. I email Bruan. They said the changed it because the holes are bigger and capture more hair. Personally, I think it could be that they no longer have that partnership with Gillette. Gillette technology was on the original foil. They said it is discontinued. It&#x27;s only plastic and metal, you could make it again if you wanted to guys.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads work just fine on a Braun 8585 (which has the \\&quot;Activator\\&quot; system, whatever that is) in case anyone is wondering.  I got a terrific shave after installing them on my 8585 today.  I replaced my original foil after 30 months of use, as the cutter finally wore through the foil leaving a hole.  I do not shave every day, as I feel better with a day&#x27;s growth, sometimes even two or three if it&#x27;s a weekend.  This probably contributed to the phenomenal 30 month life of the original screen.  For some reason this foil was $5 cheaper than the \\&quot;Activator\\&quot; 8000 series foil, so I got it.  Add to it Amazon&#x27;s free shipping and 15% discount for Subscribe &amp; Save and it is an unbeatable deal.</li>
    <li> I asked for a Braun 8000 Foil and Cutter but instead received a Braun 5000 item. It is working fine, no problems, but why can&#x27;t I get the one exactly I was looking for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it more expensive yet is the same? Maybe. I think a proper explanation from the seller would have sorted things out and a better rating from my side would have been granted.</li>
    <li> quality shaver, wouldn&#x27;t buy anything but Braun</li>
    <li> Husband likes cutters.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 8585 and with the new Braun 360 foil, it&#x27;s the closet electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Item works as described, even a little better.  I was a little nervous about some of the negative review.  But this replacement foil and cutter work just fine for my Braun 8000 series.</li>
    <li> Not very often do I have the time to thank someone when they deserve thanks and in this case YES they deserve my thanks. The Foil and Cutter heads came just in time for my vacation trip and a few days earlier then I expected. This has certainly been a plus the new Foil and Cutter made a world of difference from what a had been using. The shave is smooth and only took a few seconds to replace. I can only give praise to this product and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a better shave. The Braun can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I purchased this replacement foil/block for my 8985 before I needed it (I like to have a spare of most things, where feasible).  I have had the original for 9 months and though the foil/block is supposed to last for 18 months, I have read where the foil gets holes in it (from wear) anywhere from 6 - 18 months, so I wanted to make sure I had one when necessary.  I have not had any problems with my shaver or the original foil/block yet.  So, I have to say that, so far, so good.  I like the Braun 360 very much (I had been a razor shaver for over 30 years) and am glad I picked this model.  Time will tell how well it holds up, but no problems so far with anything after 9 months!</li>
    <li> This replacement head made a huge difference in the quality of my husband&#x27;s shave. He had put off replacing it, thinking it probably wouldn&#x27;t make that big of a difference. Boy, was he wrong. It&#x27;s just like having a new razor. It was also a good value.</li>
    <li> Like others have pointed out, this replacement kit is expensive (shop around for the cheapest options) but it works well, rejuvenating the shaver.  It&#x27;s still much cheaper than buying an entirely new shaver.</li>
    <li> No where near the quality of the original replacement parts.  Blades are farther apart, and the screen has LARGE slots holes.  Everytime you use it, you will end up with shavings all over your chest and counter.  Total garbage.</li>
    <li> It is becoming cheaper to buy through Amazon, even in these hard financial times.  The razor and cover also works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before. It is Original from Braun.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect replacement for my aging blades with noticeable improvements right away. I was also happy to find this replacement online, because the retail price of the one I almost picked up locally was $10 more. I&#x27;ve been using these replacement blades for years and have never experienced any of the problems others have complained about such a red marks on my face. They may not last the 18 months Braun says they will, but they do the job for at least a year or more just fine without any complaints from me and keep my razor alive and kicking.</li>
    <li> Let me say I have had this shaver for 4 years and have never been disappointed with it&#x27;s performance - until now. The recent replacement of the 8000 series cutter blocks with this \\&quot;new technology\\&quot; is terrible. I look like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow as soon as I&#x27;m done shaving - which takes 5 times longer than it did with the old replacement blade. This thing is now useless to me. And I get nicks and cuts (never used to with the old replacements.) I used to be a pure Braun loyalist, but this crap replacement is driving me into the arms of a new manufacturer - any suggestions? DON&#x27;T BUY THIS - IT IS AWFUL.</li>
    <li> Hard to find but this was a great replacement set. Got it fast and snapped it in place. Works great.</li>
    <li> It gives me the best and fastest shave I have ever had. I have been shavig for more than 55 years.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve owned a Braun 8000 series for several years now and I&#x27;ve absolutely loved it.  I needed a replacement cutter/foil and the only place I could find one was on Amazon.  So I ordered it and it came in direct from China, not any US or even Europe address.  After using this cutter/foil for about 3 weeks now, it just doesn&#x27;t match up to the quality of the real thing.  I definitely don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I used to.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because the shaver itself it a discontinued model (I have had it for quite a while) so Braun just sold the rights to make spare parts to China and now we&#x27;re stuck with a sub-par product.  Anyway, it works okay but nothing like the original.  I&#x27;d recommend this product if you are stuck and can&#x27;t find one in Walmart or something.  I think I&#x27;m just going to end up getting a new Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> I needed replacement blades and these did the trick.  They allowed me to get a better shave than my old blades and that is a good thing.  With that said, they certainly have some downsides.    (1) They&#x27;re quite expensive.  I might have to consider getting a new razor before purchasing these again.    (2) They don&#x27;t trigger the \\&quot;intensive cleaning needed\\&quot; message on my 8995 like my old blades.  Previously, I&#x27;d get the cleaning message after about 10-15 minutes of shaving ... now I could shave for hours and it&#x27;ll never pop up.  Is that a deal-breaker?  No, I can figure out when I should clean the razor on my own, but wasn&#x27;t that LCD/notification one of the supposed perks of the 8995 over lower models?    (3) They retain much more hair than my old blades ever did.  The hair really collects on the inside ends of the blades, so you have to get at it with the brush after each shave.  If you don&#x27;t, you will have to replace your cleaning solution a lot sooner.</li>
    <li> The braun shaver series to me are the best on the market. The heads and cutter get worn and have to be replaced.. I think there is more money to be made in replacement parts than the shaver purchase itself.. Its a necessary evil to me sorta.  Hi dollars for such a small part... There is really no choice&#x27;s in this area of shaving.. You only can get this part number to fit and its a matter of where you are going to purchase yours.. I got the best deal at Amazon..  I love it and rate it a 5 because it is in the braun fashion a superior quality item and it works awesome ..</li>
    <li> Great product and great service.    Thanks a lot;    Jack Budnack</li>
    <li> Not a great price, but with Amazon Prime I saved a gallon of gas and sales tax by not having to drive to the store for this purchase.    Installing the blade and foil was very easy and the new blades make quite a difference.</li>
    <li> What a difference new blades make. I&#x27;m getting a closer shave now and the ctter is easier to clean in between deep cleansings.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I have ever used. The new foil cutter block makes it just like new again.</li>
    <li> SEE BOTTOM FOR MY UPDATE:  Is the 51s foil and cutter really terrible? Is the 30B foil and cutter really better for your Braun Series 8000 shaver? Is there an Original Equipment foil and cutter still available for the Braun 8985 shaver? Answers: no, no, and no. I have the Braun 8985 shaver and bought BOTH of the foils and cutters mentioned in these reviews: the 51s, which Braun sells as its only replacement now for the 8000 series, and the 30b, which is supposed to be for the Braun 7000/4000 series shavers, but some buyers are saying it works better for the 8000 series shavers than the so-called \\&quot;terrible\\&quot; 51s replacement. Both foils and cutters fit my 8985 shavers, and I&#x27;ve shaved serveral times with both. The 51s does NOT pull, cut or irritate my face and gives a very close shave, particularly if I have a 2-day beard. The 30b also gives a good shave, but perhaps not quite as close. Some reviewers say the 51s wears out quickly, is prone to dents and starts irritating your face. If that happens, I will update this review, but so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 51s by mistake because the seller&#x27;s web listing did not mention that its \\&quot;Braun 8000 360 Complete Foil and Cutter Block for Models 8995, 8985 and 8975\\&quot; is really the controversial 51s replacement. When it arrived with the dreaded 51s name on the package, I immediately ordered the 30b foil and cutter and planned to return the 51s, but I waited until the 30b arrived so I could be sure it worked. It does, but it buzzes differently and didn&#x27;t shave much closer than my 3-year-old original foil and cutter. The 30b DOES give a more comfortable shave -- it glides over your face like nothing is happening. The shave is fine, what you&#x27;d expect from any electric. But Braun is better than \\&quot;any electric.\\&quot; The 51s is giving me that exceptionally close shave I expect from Braun. You DO feel the 51s a bit more than the 30b, but it&#x27;s not irritating. I am keeping the 30b in case my 51s goes haywire on me, but for now, the 51s seems better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 6, 2012: I&#x27;m glad I kept the 30b because the 51s did indeed start inflicting red marks on my face, and it stopped shaving as closely. Very disappointing. So now I&#x27;m using the 30b, the red marks on my face are gone, and the shave is close. So if I had it to do all over again, I would recommend getting tthe 30b foil and cutter instead of the 51s.51s seems better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 6, 2012: I&#x27;m glad I kept the 30b because the 51s did indeed start inflicting red marks on my face, and it stopped shaving as closely. Very disappointing. So now I&#x27;m using the 30b, the red marks on my face are gone, and the shave is close. So if I had it to do all over again, I would recommend getting tthe 30b foil and cutter instead of the 51s.</li>
    <li> I agree completely with all of the other 1 star reviews.  This is an inferior replacement option.  I love the electric razor and have been a loyal Braun customer for over 35 years.  This replacement is rough and requires at a minimum an additional 2 minutes of shaving to \\&quot;get it all\\&quot;.  I would pass and see if you can find older foil and cutter block inventory at your local CVS or Rite-Aid.</li>
    <li> Keeps breaking after minimal use.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about purchasing this product after reading some of the reviews.  I couldn&#x27;t find an alternative since they don&#x27;t make the 360 complete anymore so I chanced it.  My Braun 8975 now shaves like new with the Series 5 installed.  I grew my beard 2 full days and there was no pulling.  It&#x27;s a clean close shave.  I read some people say that their new 51S Series 5 was made in China and that is was inferior.  My foil &amp; cutter were made in Germany.  They fit and shave perfectly.  If you have one made in China it might be a knockoff.....  BTW JoAnn is my wife :D</li>
    <li> I have been ordering replacement blades and foil for my Braun Razor through Amazon.com for a few years now and I am very satified with both the replacement parts as well as the price.  I have no complaints and would recommend anyone with Braun Electric Razors to try Amazon.com for there replacement parts.</li>
    <li> makes my older less expensive model just as good as the new expensive one and yes the best electric there is.</li>
    <li> This new cutter was great.  It returned my razor to the performance when it was new.  After reading a few reviews, I almost did not purchase it.  I can tell it is designed a little different than the orignal, but when I installed the new cutter and foil it worked great.  I think it is performing like it was when it was new.  I let it go way too long before I replaced it.</li>
    <li> I had this razor for almost 3 years and decided to coin up and change the foil and cutter. WOW Better than expected. the razor always had a noisey rough feel to it after replacing it with this new setup Its quiet and cuts smooth . I shouldnt have waited so long to replace it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter block lasts 6 months at best.   As a long-time Norelco user, I purchased the Braun based upon a Consumer Reports review; a big mistake!  The shaving process is much slower, rougher on the skin, noisier, and the heads wear out far too quickly.  Never again; it&#x27;s back to Norelco for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with the Braun 360 Complete shaver since it was introduced.  I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for many years, and the 360 complete gives me the best shave.  Unforunately, the foil wears out in about 2-3 months.  I&#x27;ve never had a Braun foil with such a short life.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and I tried using less pressure, but to no avail.  I even complained to Braun.  If the shave wasn&#x27;t so good, I would have changed shavers by now.</li>
    <li> love it use it need it and got it for the best price....just what the doctor ordered....i&#x27;ll be back!</li>
    <li> At first, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t fit but when I got it and tested everything out, it works great!!  It&#x27;s cheaper than any other retailers and would buy it again if I need it in the future.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement foil for Braun razor. Product transaction was smooth &amp; prompt. Item came in unopened package &amp; was exact replacement part. I would buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> What a good value for something you will always need my favorite razor and these are the replacement at the best price.</li>
    <li> Tends to get dull well before the manufacturers recommended time in use. A minor hassle, as I have subscribed to Amazon and new ones are auto-shipped to me every 4 months.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement foil and cutter for my older 8000 Series shaver.  This is only the second time I&#x27;ve replaced the foil and cutter, but I really should do it more often.  I forgot what a difference it makes.  My shaver is like new again.</li>
    <li> Great replacement product.  Wish we could purchase another shaver just like this one, as newer models are not the same.</li>
    <li> the razor replacement parts were just what we needed.  it is getting harder to find parts for an electric razor. I am thank full for this site to provide the needed parts.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my elderly father who loves his Braun shaver. We have gotten replacement blades at a store in town before, but Amazon offered the exact same thing for about $15 less.  Dad put the blades in with no difficulty and is happily clean shaven again.</li>
    <li> Still love the razor after all these years.</li>
    <li> The Braun shaver works fine, however these replacements are not high quality, I am on my 4th one.  The last foil got a hole in it within 30 days, the one before it within 4 months.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this item but it turned out to be as if it were new and I can observe the visual difference between using my 2 year old original set and this new set. \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot; on the package gave extra comfort as well (I hope that it is true).</li>
    <li> I opted for the \\&quot;older\\&quot; style foil and cutter block, based upon reviewes that the newer version was somewhat rough on the skin. This version is great, very smooth. It&#x27;s like I have a new razor. Good deal, fast delivery. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The outter foil arrived with a dent, making it impossible to clip onto the razor.  I was also unable to bent it back since it is too delicate. I had to go to Target to buy a replacement.</li>
    <li> Great blade. Just be sure to get the ones made by Gillette as they are wider and seem to give a better shave.</li>
    <li> My Dad loves his Braun and didn&#x27;t want to give it up, even though it&#x27;s over 5 year old, for a new one.  This new foil and cutter block made his old razor cut like new and he&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Braun 360 8995 razor is a great choice.  Bruan fully supports the kit and replacement heads are readily available from Braun.  I replaced at the recommended interval, and the unit was restored to New condition.</li>
    <li> A great product for those not using safety razors such as I have been doing for over 60 years. Of course, daily use requires more replacements.  Braun was better though before being affiliated with Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have an 8985 and putting this replacement cutter and foil made it work like new. It was simple to install and did just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Good replacement parts.  No complaints, although seems a little pricey.</li>
    <li> This is the second foil and cutter block I have bought for my husband for his shaver and both have worked great--keeps me from having to buy the expensive shaver :)  The shave is close and fits on the razor great.</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;as scheduled&amp;#34; for timely replacament- &amp; it will be! I&#x27;ve found this electric razor to be the best - for my face - &amp; my beard- to the the best for me in the almost 14 years post-stroke! I had to use an electric razor- as my right side was paralyzed &amp; &amp;#34;regular razor&amp;#34; shaving is not a safe thing! I get a ver good shave with Braun razors too! THANKS!</li>
    <li> Purchased these as replacement blades for my 90 year old father. He was very happy with them and that&#x27;s not an easy task.</li>
    <li> Shave was just as good as a blade.   Blades have gotten so expensive that this is the better buy.   The rotays fall short of the Braun.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GBMYC0 Braun 8000 360 Complete Foil and Cutter Block for Models 8995, 8985 and 8975]]      I had to replace my foil &amp; cutter for my braun 360, This replacement part is excellent &amp; my Braun is back to new condition. Easy to install, Set for another 18 Months.</li>
    <li> This product returned the shaver to new condition. Shaves as well as it did the first time. Long lasting. Still cuts well after 18 months when it is time to change as directed.</li>
    <li> My shaves were not close after 12 months usage of my new razor. Braun recommends replacing the foil and cutting block after 18 months but I have a very tough beard so I decided to replace those items early. The razor is like new again.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the complete foil &amp; cutter block for my braun 8995 razor. [[ASIN:B000GBMYC0 Braun 8000 360 Complete Foil and Cutter Block for Models 8995, 8985 and 8975]] I must say it performs as advertised. It&#x27;s as though I were shaving with a new razor again. I believe it is money well spent.</li>
    <li> Change every ~6 months to get like new performance with your shaver. Braun suggests longer periods but I am willing to pay little bit for better performance.</li>
    <li> It is a shame that you need to replace blade &amp; foil so often. Product does give you a close shave. Just need to figure out how to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve always used Braun products and have never been disappointed with the quality or price.</li>
    <li> No frills just the item you wanted.  Why talk about how the item works or feels and other stupid stuff...  It is the real replacement part for your real Braun shaver.  So if it is from Braun and it is a Braun then t must be a Braun...  In a NUT SHELL it is the COST why you get this from Amazon. That is great and the shipping was good and fast so there I am done with this review.</li>
    <li> Be aware, what you see on the pictures is not what they are going to send to you.  What they sent to me is in a different box compared to the pictures and has a different net also. Match my shaver but look like from a previous version.  I didn&#x27;t try yet how work because my old one is still working and I bought as replacement for the future.</li>
    <li> This is an exact replacement for my 8 year old shaver and it works well.  I just hope that they continue to make parts for my Braun for several more years.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as advertised and vastly improved the quality of my shave.  I did not realize how worn down my current blade was.</li>
    <li> I found the product to be asy to assemble and based on the almost daily shaving that I do I feel it is doing a good job and giving me a close, comfortable shave.  I seems better than the previos blades I have received from Braun.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet, but it&#x27;s a replacement for the Braun shaver I&#x27;m using and I am very satisfied with the shaver so the replacement product should be very good.</li>
    <li> Had my electric Braun for 8+ years, time for new foil and internals.  Man, wish I would have done this sooner.  I feel and see a big difference.  Definitely a cleaner and closer shave.</li>
    <li> I have owned my 360 Complete model 8985 for over 3 years now.  Love shaving with it. I don&#x27;t use any creams or talc. Always shave after a shower and with a dry face. I often go days without cleaning, and sometimes substitute plain alcohol for the cleaning solution.  Yes, I&#x27;m CHEAP!    Therefore, I thought it was BS to pay $30-$40 for a replacement part for the razor I paid $170 for. I decided I&#x27;d keep it relatively clean and it would be fine until it was dead.  Well, I broke down recently due to more and more neck irritation and bought this replacement set at a retail chain with a 20% off coupon...paid around $34.      Wow!!! It was like the first time I used the razor...NO...better, cause now my beard is used to the foils! I am an IDIOT for waiting this long, and for constantly tweezing hairs that the old, dull razor head didn&#x27;t get!      Honestly, please learn from me...and from the manufacturer&#x27;s suggestion for that matter...which I often disregard as pure greed.  But in this case, for about $2 a month, you will have a much better shave. If you change yours in the recommended time (18 months), you won&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference like I did...and that is the point, my friends!  Lesson learned...happy customer again!</li>
    <li> Very nice as advertised.</li>
    <li> I see a couple negative reviews here and I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is - foil and cutter is identical to any of the others that have come from my Braun 8985 shaver.  Its good value over what you would pay for the cutter and foil at Walmart although I still question why Braun needs to charge so much at all.</li>
    <li> this replacement foil and cutter results in a very smooth shave and further extends the useful life of the shaver itself</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find after I ordered the product there was a newer model available.  I assume the newer model is an improvement over the one I purchased but the cost to exchange it was prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should have explained the difference between models and offered an exchange if the performance of the newer one was significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
    <li> Feels like a new shaver!   Would have given it a 5 if not for the price. A bit much for what you get, should have been more like $20.00.Amazon was the best price I found</li>
    <li> I have checked every site on the internet for the cheapest price for this item and Amazon beats everyone.  PRPritts--Bloomingdale, IL</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery---Replacing the pricey cutter and foil does restore the shaver to \\&quot;like new\\&quot; performance</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. The foil and cutter last over a year, unlike my Remington foil that eventually wore thru - not with the Braun foil.</li>
    <li> Works fine wish the razors weren&#x27;t so much money  as far as the product it is great and would order it again from you</li>
    <li> Works good with my razor, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and it was delivered in perfect condition. I used standard shipping and I recommend it if you don&#x27;t need it urgently. The product itself seems overpriced but I guess its OK considering you need to replace the foil+cutter once in a year &amp; half.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are kind of expensive to be buying often, but they do make your Braun razor shave like it did when it first came out of the box. I popped this in 1.5 years after buying the razor and it&#x27;s back to new. Definitely worth doing every 1-2 years.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how the new cutter and foil improved the shave. I should have gotten a new one a few months ago. Stick with the recommended replacement policy of at least every 18 months or sooner.</li>
    <li> The new coil is the best!!  Im sure its because the razor is the best!! Buy it now!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t have the 360 logo on it but overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been reading any of the reviews here lately you will know the 8000 series foil/cutterblock combo has been replaced with a new combo now called the series 5 Combi 51S.  You will receive this replacement even if the picture on the product page shows \\&quot;8000 series\\&quot; as it has been discontinued for over a year.  Braun merged the replacement for the 8000 series (Activator) with the 360 Complete.  This new foil/cutterblock is garbage!  The cutterblock has wide blades, as opposed to the thinner blades of the original 8000 series, which pull your stubble and take MANY passes over your face to shave.  They are prone to premature failure and I have gone through 3(THREE) of these in 6 months!  (I bought one and two were free through Braun after complaining).  All the free replacements in the world weren&#x27;t making the shaving experience any better.  I longed for the days when my Activator 8595 cut smooth, close, and comfortably.  After all, this shaver had been my favorite for 6 years so far!  I was very close to dumping the whole shaver and moving on when I happened across a reviewer on Amazon who suggested using the 7000 series replacement foil/cutterblock in his review.  It worked PERFECTLY!  The 7000 series replacement looks just like the much coveted original on my 8595 Activator - down to the thinner cutting blades!  It didn&#x27;t pull my stubble, it cut smooth as butter, and was comfortable: JUST LIKE NEW!  I&#x27;d like to thank the original reviewer (James L. Walls \\&quot;sixtoe\\&quot;) for the very good advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: August 10th, 2011***&lt;br /&gt;I hope people are happy with the replacement I recommended.  I sure am!  I just wanted to update the product link for the better replacement: [[ASIN:B001VH6F9G Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: January 13, 2013***&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the Braun 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack is now the same terrible cutter block design as the series 5 (8000 replacement).I ordered another 30B to replace the one I bought 2.5 years ago and was highly disappointed when the package came.  I will have to do some research to see if any of Braun&#x27;s other replacements are the good, narrow blade versions.  I have read some reports that the narrow cutting block is available, but without the foil.  If I cannot find a narrow blade replacement I am going to throw in the towel after 8 years of service from this shaver.  Shame on Braun for putting out those ill performing wide blade cutting blocks.  Terrible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: January 18, 2013***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears the highly elusive narrow blade cutter block can be found on the 31S replacement pack.  The unfortunate news is the included foil is not compatible.  Therefore, a replacement foil for the 8000 series/Activator/7000 series/360 Complete would be needed in conjunction with the quality cutter block effectively doubling your cost because it is difficult to find the foil sold by itself.  This would be a combined expense of roughly $55-$60 in order to bring your shaver back to the \\&quot;like new\\&quot; shave we all want.  Remember - the \\&quot;direct\\&quot; replacement combo for this shaver series will leave you highly disappointed due to the WIDE cutter block which pulls hair and easily nicks skin.  Another facet to influence your decision in spending $60 to refresh your Braun is many of these shavers - due to their age - are in need of new motors and potentially batteries.  The motors gradually slow down with time and I noticed a HUGE difference when I replaced mine 2 years ago.  Now, these motors are almost impossible to find at this point and for me, personally, it is getting to the point of diminished returns.  I hope this post helps you in both informing you of the available narrow cutter block, but also in weighing your decision in either keeping your Braun chugging along or researching a new alternative.</li>
    <li> Great shave.  Don&#x27;t forget to reset replacement indicator after installing New blades</li>
    <li> This Foil and Cutter Block was exactly what my husband needed to repair his shaver!</li>
    <li> Easy to install and it&#x27;s like having a new razor again. Why buy a new one when you can just replace the cutters.</li>
    <li> these last me about a year and the quality is excellent. Will buy again next year</li>
    <li> I ordered this, but the company sent a differnt product...which I returned. They claim to have sent me the correct package, but I&#x27;ve yet to receive it - 3 weeks later.</li>
    <li> Just my .2 cents. I have a Braun model #8985 Series 5. After a year of satisfactory use, I thought I should replace the foil and cutters. I got the one recommended for my shaver, the 51S. I started to use it, and after just a few shaves, I noticed the shaves were not as smooth, and more irritation to my face, than I was getting with my original shaver I had for the past year. Now just after a few shaves, I noticed my cutter was starting to dull. I stuck with it a few more months, and then I started looking for a better cutting block for it. I came on Amazon and read some reviews, and there were many satisfied users of the 30B kit. . I even called Braun, and told them my situation, and asked if I could change over to the 30B, instead of staying with the 51S. NO WAY said the rep, use only the cartridge recommended by Braun, the 51S. Well, I decided otherwise, and went to \\&quot;Target\\&quot;, and got the 30B replacement foil and cutter. Boy, what a difference. It fits right in, no problem with the foil or the cutter fitting, I even like the foil better than the 51S, seems to roll over my fact smoother. The shaves seem so much better. Now to be honest, I have not used the razor much yet, but I&#x27;ll get back to you with my thoughts when I do. On my #8985 there is a light that comes on, and it says \\&quot;change foil\\&quot;, which came on right then when I changed the foil over to the 30B, it lite up. There is a reset button right there, and if you push it with a pen or pencil point, the light goes out after blinking a few times. Maybe the 30B is the way to go, and the 30B is about $15 cheaper than the 51S. I don&#x27;t know what Braun is doing, but it is not making me buy a new Braun. If I get upset with their shaver, I&#x27;m not going to buy a new Braun, I will switch brands. Hate to say this folks, but every manufacturer out there is trying to rip us off today! Regards, TC</li>
    <li> This is the third replacement I&#x27;ve bought for my 8000 series Braun shaver.  This replacement head does a lousy job of shaving in brand new condition.  My old head, that was two years old, shaved much better.  The new one feels like it is pulling the hairs out instead of cutting them.  I had seen some reviews talking about this problem, but decided to give it a try.... a big mistake.</li>
    <li> The package photo displayed for this product is not what you will get when you order this.  The package displayed here shows the original foil with the blue center, but instead you will receive the flat silver center.  Also, the design of the holes in the foil shown on the package photo is different from what you actually get.  What you will get is instead of what is shown on this package photo, is a Braun Series 5 51s which can be purchased from Amazon for much less than this falsely advertised product.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Using them now.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Works great, came in time</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to install. Fits perfectly into my husband&#x27;s razor. The price on Amazon is the best I was able to find anywhere. It was nearly $10 more at my local Target store. Crazy.</li>
    <li> my blades were well past their replacement date and i noticed my shaves were not as close as they used to be.  however, the replacements don&#x27;t seem to be any better.  further, the first few shaves with the new blades have been pretty painful because of an increased number of \\&quot;snags\\&quot;.  while it was cheaper to replace the blades, i probably should have just sucked it up and bought a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> My razor now cuts better than I ever.  I don&#x27;t remember it cutting this well when it was new.  I had used the original foil and cutter for 25 months.</li>
    <li> The replacement cutter head and screen fit well, are easily installed and work beautifully.  The service from Amazon is quick, and even though the replacement parts are pricey, Amazon does have infrequent sales to help reduce the overall costs. But the replacement parts are every bit as good as the originals and serve me well for a long time.</li>
    <li> It works great and gives a shave like when the shaver was new. Shipped quickly and by the date promised. I would recommend this as a great product.</li>
    <li> i used to always use a razor for my neck as my religion doesn&#x27;t allow razors  on the face, and an electric shaver for my face. i always struggled to find the perfect combo until now, and this was the missing peaice, very happy with it, well worth the cost. its expensive, but almost everything in life that is good and far superior to the competition is more expensive, right?</li>
    <li> Great price on replacement head.</li>
    <li> Very good product, exactly what I needed.  It came when promised, it was what I ordered, and I got free shipping with my Amazon Prime.  I highly recommend this especially if you want something as specific as this.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery - everything I expected.</li>
    <li> using same electric for over 6 years</li>
    <li> Better than a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> BRAUN 360 COMPLETE,REPLACEMENT SCREEN AND CUTTING BLOCK  ARE THE BEST PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR A SMOOTH CLOSE SHAVE</li>
    <li> This is the OEM replacement foil and cutter for Braun 8985 electric shaver (and others).  It makes your shaver feel brand new again.  It&#x27;s as simple as removing your old foil/cutter and popping in the new one.  The replacement works just as good as new; very close and comfortable.  BTW, this shaver is rated tops in Consumer&#x27;s Report; while not cheapest it works great!    This price for this product from this seller was a good deal plus it&#x27;s difficult to find this item at retail stores.</li>
    <li> Been using the Braun 360 for a year now. These blades are good but I can&#x27;t get more than 4 or 5 months out of them. I have a heavy beard growth. Still cheaper than disposable blades.</li>
    <li> If you have the face of a baby or a little girl, this may last you 18 months, but real men with actual facial hair will find that it will last 6 months, tops. The product works well when it&#x27;s new, but performance drops off noticeably after a couple of months.    I bought my Braun razor because I was spending too much money on decent blades. But with the high price of the razor, the Clean &amp; Charge solution that needs constant replacement, and this foil and cutter block that needs changing twice a year, I think the razor manufacturers have us by the balls and they know it.</li>
    <li> I AM SATISFIED WITH THE BRAUN REPLACEMENT FOIL &amp; CUTTER BLOCK THAT I PURCHASED ONLINE THROUGH AMAZON. I ALSO FOUND IT TO BE THE LEAST EXPENSIVE IN COMPARISON TO OTHER VENDORS.</li>
    <li> The blade replacement didn&#x27;t really feel like that much of a difference from my old blade that I had on the Braun.  I didn&#x27;t notice any less irritation by changing the blade but I guess it did do a quicker job in cutting the hair to the proximity I wanted.  All in all not too shabby.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GBMYC0 Braun 8000 360 Complete Foil and Cutter Block for Models 8995, 8985 and 8975]]  The new foil and cutter block fully restored the shaver to like new performance.  I may do it sooner next time.</li>
    <li> Cutter got here sooner than expected, They have re-worked there design, and now it cuts better and is working better.  I was hoping they could do some improvement and they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dick Rayburn/I shave with it, Patsy lets me use her account, after being married 62&lt;br /&gt;years she wants me to look good and have a smooth face.  I agree !!!</li>
    <li> I have always liked Braun products.  Shave&#x27;s so close my girlfriend thinks my face is smoother than my . . .</li>
    <li> What can I say .... Exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly in my model 8985.</li>
    <li> After reading a number of other reviews on Amazon, my husband elected to buy the Braun Model 30B (Series 3) foil and cutter for his Braun model 8585 razor instead of this one. The package for the 30B says it&#x27;s for model 7000 / 4000 Series razors, but it works great on the series 8000 model 8585. He says the razor shaves great and works like it&#x27;s brand-new. Thanks to the others who posted this information!</li>
    <li> I bought this foil and cutter back in April to replace the original one from my braun 8995; what a world of difference.  The shaver trims like new again, much smoother on my skin.  I had no issues with the fit like some reviews mentioned.  Little pricey, but good quality and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> isn&#x27;t as expected, no match with the shaver machine</li>
    <li> What can you say?  It is from Braun to fit their shaver, so it fits &#x27;like new&#x27; and works just fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to come across the correct shaver replacement head in stores.  This is the easiest way I&#x27;ve found to do it.  I&#x27;ve replaced from here twice.  I&#x27;ll keep doing it this way for the life of the shaver...</li>
    <li> This is a relatively good product, and it was available, but if the price creeps up anymore, I will switch brands when it comes to buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> If you have a Braun shaver and have not purchased a replacement before, do it.  It&#x27;s like having a brand new shaver for about 1/6 the price.</li>
    <li> Well in spite of some of the poor reviews, I bought this foil and cutter for my 8781 razor.  Yesterday I spent nearly an hour using a styptic pencil to stop the bleeding from a cut from the new installation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After further inspection, I determined that this foil and cutter would sometimes pop up out of its mount, exposing one edge end of the foil, which is quite sharp.  As long as the foil and cutter stayed in place, it functioned correctly.  I cleaned the socket carefully, reassembled, and have had no further problems.  It is not as good as the original foil and cutter set, but it is working.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace and great value given the alternative was replacing the whole shaver.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to renew my Braun</li>
    <li> Great replacement cutter for my electric razor.  Gives me a closer shave than the old cutter.  Should have bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> fits great, works great, fast delivery</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like having a new razor</li>
    <li> Better than I expected</li>
    <li> the as the lasta 5 years, verygood</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have tried this new replacement cartridge for the series 5 Braun now recommends for the 8595 and it is terrible, the first one barely made it 6 months and the second one I have used it daily for a month when I noticed the shaves were not getting as close as they used to be. I am 3 months in and my razor is virtually unuseable until I replace the cutter/foil, I will get the 7000 series head instead. Not sure what Braun is doing with this series 5 but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be working well.</li>
    <li> The quality of BRAUN. ...</li>
    <li> Great product...produces very close shave.</li>
    <li> My husband was shaving less because his razor was cutting his face...He didn&#x27;t tell me...so I was happy to find a replacement cutter block for his razor on Amazon....now he is nice to be near!!</li>
    <li> The existing shaver and head are 6 years old and have held up well.  I have not used it yet but it looks like the same quality as the original foil and cutter block.  Braun is a great shaver, probably the best I have had.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapo replacement version with thick tines and semi-circle blades.  This is not the highly desirable thin tine cutter block with full circle blade. Braun sure did ruin probably the best razor on the planet.</li>
    <li> This replacement of blades Braun, makes it easy me to continue using my machine Shaver Braun, which I consider one of the best in this field.</li>
    <li> What a difference a new blade makes...  I needed this instead of cutting myself with an old cutter block.  Will get one sooner next time.</li>
    <li> Just what my Dad needed for his older model Braun. He could not find it in local stores. Thank You.</li>
    <li> This is a factory replacement part for several models of Braun shavers, so it fits perfectly, and it works just like the original part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is the price.  You&#x27;ll hold it in your hand and say, \\&quot;How could this thing cost $30!?\\&quot;  Well, it just does; if you want the factory part, you have to pay the factory price.  There is no after-market replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you even need to replace the cutter assembly?  Probably so.  Obviously, if you dent the original by fumbling your shaver, you&#x27;ll need a replacement.  However, even with perfect care, the original cutter wears out in about 18 months.  If you pop the foil cover off of your shaver, you can see why:  The blades run back and forth against the foil cover, shearing off the whiskers that have protruded into the tiny holes and slots.  Eighteen months of friction does the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want the Braun shaver-- which, by the way is excellent-- then you just have to buy the parts needed to do the periodic maintenance.  Life is like that sometimes...</li>
    <li> The Braun 360 system 8995 is good but not superb. I don&#x27;t like the triple blades on the Norelco systems I&#x27;ve used in the past. My last shaver was a Remington MS3 and it worked great. The battery got old and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I upgraded to the Braun. The cleaning system is wonderful. I tap out after a shave then use the cleaning system ever other day which is more than sufficient. It takes me about 2:30 for a complete shave, under the chin and the underside of the jawline are toughest to get real close. I actually think my Remington was a bit closer shave, not to disparage the Braun, but I had hopes of the closest shave ever and it&#x27;s not quite that.</li>
    <li> Really like my Braun electric razor, but it was getting louder &amp; message&lt;br /&gt;on display said it was time to change the foil.  Ordered the foil &amp; new cutting head...now it&#x27;s back to running quieter &amp; cutting better; just like new.  A good product so far after about 1 year of use.</li>
    <li> Simply looking for a replacement foil but, found this to either be horrifically expensive or impossible to find in the U.S. I had to order it from Ireland of all places. Still spendy nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement.  Easy to replace and the shaver is now as good as new!</li>
    <li> Very good products. Thank you</li>
    <li> product was what i wanted ,delivery was in time frame .</li>
    <li> Received instead the new 5 series version....And I don&#x27;t like that Foil pattern,&lt;br /&gt;with this phrase i should get all the required words. lol</li>
    <li> I used my last set for like 4 years. They are good for 6 years. It is nice having a close shave again and replacing the center cut blade is also ideal.</li>
    <li> Recieved the foil and cutter on time and in perfect condition. The instructions for installing were very helpful. The only problem is that my razor after three years of use quit working and is no longer in use,</li>
    <li> Shiiping was on time and the Price was right. will order again in 6 months when I need a new one</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for many years with regular purchases of new blades, however this one and the one before are simply not the same quality as they used to be years ago.  Blades were once sharper and shaved more closely.  This was probably my last one.</li>
    <li> I waited too long to replace the foil and cutter block for my Braun shaver.  But what a difference the new parts made!  It&#x27;s like a new shaver!  Shipment was prompt and the parts were easy to install.  My only complaint is the cost.</li>
    <li> This was an overdue replacement. In spite of several cautionary reviews this cutter block seems to work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I am using a 8985 razor. I&#x27;ve been using the new cutter block for about eight weeks.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery!  The blade and screen fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> very timely in receiving the product. perfect fit.. much easier than going to braun.&lt;br /&gt;I like very much how it is just one piece.</li>
    <li> This is really good product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I honestly forget how long I go before I change the cutting block (recommended change is 18 months) but these foils and blocks get your shaver to brand new status.  As long as your shaver holds a charge, keep the foils changed and you will have an awesome shaver.</li>
    <li> Did not help my shave. I finally got a good shave using my old foil shaver. Something is wrong with these replacements. The old foil shaver does a much faster job.</li>
    <li> Easy to install on shaver, and close quick shaves are back again! The price is slightly better than Target. Great value.....</li>
    <li> Typical Braun quality.  A costly accessory, but you only need to change annually.  My third time purchasing these accessories for the life of the shaver.</li>
    <li> I have had my shaver for a number of years and it still works great. I have (as my shaver gets older)had problems finding replacement parts but this is it. Fits great, works great, and i don&#x27;t have to go from store to store looking for the right one. Shaver works just like new.</li>
    <li> My husband actually complained these were too sharp for his face.  I, however, was very pleased!</li>
    <li> It was a perfect fit, not making much noise.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Slow shipping.</li>
    <li> good deal, saved $20 over walmart</li>
    <li> Fit like a glove and my shaver is like brand new again. Definitely recommend this product. Will be replacing my shaver heads with more frequency now.</li>
    <li> Like having a new razor.</li>
    <li> They changed the style of cutter and foil in this model and not only do they not work well but they also don&#x27;t last even half as long as the original style do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since getting this one back at the end of 2009 I&#x27;ve been buying the &amp;#34;Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo&amp;#34; set because it was identical to the old style foil and cutter but was black instead of grey/silver, but the set I order earlier this year now had the new style foil and blades so I&#x27;m again searching for a compatable model that still has the older setup.</li>
    <li> The new foil and cutter fit my older model Braun 8975 perfectly, and gave a very close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Hard to find. Worked perfect on my 8900 series shaver.</li>
    <li> The item was received on time.  I have used the item for approximately 10 days and it works great, better than the original foil and cutter.  I recommend the item and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Initially, I thought Braun was pushing blade replacement as just another way to make money, but the old blade set eventually broke and I was forced to get new ones. What a difference they make! As the old set wore down, the shave became harder and took longer - and was more uncomfortable. The problem was that it happened so gradually, I never really noticed it. The first shave after the new blades were installed was a revelation - smooth, no pulling - just like when the razor was new (but I had forgotten about).  If you have a Braun with old blades, changing them can make a huge difference in comfort and performance.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected. Shaver shaves like new. Appears to be factory quality and will not disappoint. No need to purchase new shaver.</li>
    <li> brought new life back to a fairly expensive shaver  ...  feels like new again  ..  though these aren&#x27;t cheap ,.. but it works . !</li>
    <li> Functions as expected!</li>
    <li> This the worst ever. Bad fitting. Not comparable to the original.  Not worth $10</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a new foil and cutter head for my braun electric razor. The old set had seen better days and performance suffering. The replacement foil and cutter head gave a just like new shave!</li>
    <li> I saw this at Target for almost $50!  Overjoyed to buy it here for what it&#x27;s really worth.  I&#x27;ll come back to buy more a few times each year.</li>
    <li> It works great! first one was dented in one corner but was replaced quickly and now I get close shaves again.</li>
    <li> Yay!!!!  Finally, his old razor is up and running as it should, great!  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Foil and cutter works great!</li>
