      <li>Very nice item like a picture</li>
      <li>the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
      <li>I wish they had some kind of adhesive surface so they could stick to itself.</li>
      <li>I have never used a product like this before and was pleased with the stretchy nature of the strips.</li>
      <li>You can do better.</li>
      <li>it looks and feels a bit cheap; nothing to do with the price.</li>
      <li>As a salon owner I&#x27;m very busy and don&#x27;t have time reading fine print</li>
      <li>, I recommended and arrive just on time, thank you very much, why I need to write a lots of words.</li>
      <li>they do exactly what they are supposed to.</li>
      <li>Large quantity, so I won&#x27;t have to purchase often.</li>
      <li>Garbage really dissappointed they arent big enough need to be a bit longer and have some kind of stickiness</li>
      <li>really thought this product would be much thicker.</li>
      <li>They seem to work well and minimize complaints from my 7 year old of itchy hairs on his neck during haircuts.</li>
      <li>Take it from a professional..</li>
      <li>They are rougher than the more expensive Terry style, but worth the money if you buy in bulk.</li>
      <li>They are very thin, may be ideal for other purposes but not for wrapping or molding hair.</li>

<li> These neck strips are not very strong, I typically use these to mold wet hair and because they are applied to wet hair they broke easily.  </li>
<li> instead I received 2 (two) single packs of neck strips not a box.</li>

<li> Not what I was expected...</li>
<li> Does not really collect hair well.</li>
<li> These are annoyingly thin and just a little too short to suit my normal-sized husband&#x27;s neck.</li>
<li> Work well in the Sanek dispenser, which I seriously recommend.</li>
<li> The thinness also makes them hard to handle and difficult to keep in place.</li>

    <li> Does the job, keeps clients neck from sweating and sticking to cape.</li>
    <li> really thought this product would be much thicker.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product like this before and was pleased with the stretchy nature of the strips. They seem to work well and minimize complaints from my 7 year old of itchy hairs on his neck during haircuts. Large quantity, so I won&#x27;t have to purchase often.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to receive a product that looks like the picture( a box with neck strips) instead I received two single packs of neck strips not a box. That is not what the image states and it is not in the description. It would be 5 stars if it wasnt for that miss leading detail</li>
    <li> Please change image I was misguided and thought this was a box of sanek strips. Never purchasing again !!! As a salon owner I&#x27;m very busy and don&#x27;t have time reading fine print</li>
    <li> Garbage really dissappointed they arent big enough need to be a bit longer and have some kind of stickiness so they stay in place</li>
    <li> First 2 right out of the package ripped, but not uncommon. Work well in the Sanek dispenser, which I seriously recommend. Otherwise you take off the packaging and have a 60 count accordion to deal with. They are rougher than the more expensive Terry style, but worth the money if you buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> I am a barber and have been using sanek for years. they do exactly what they are supposed to. If you learn to put the neck strip on correctly then you do not need self-adhesive strips like people are wishing they had. Take it from a professional.. these are great products</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I was expecting to receive a product that looks like the picture( a box  with 12 packs ) instead I received 2 (two) single packs of neck strips not a box. That is not what the image states and it is not in the description. It would be 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for that miss leading detail...</li>
    <li> I wish it came with a dispenser</li>
    <li> I had a pack of nice thick black crepe-paperish neck strips that really did the job. I bought these to replace them, figuring that a neck strip is a neck strip. Nope. These are annoyingly thin and just a little too short to suit my normal-sized husband&#x27;s neck. The thinness also makes them hard to handle and difficult to keep in place. They&#x27;re just meh. You can do better.</li>
    <li> it looks and feels a bit cheap; nothing to do with the price. needs adhesive tape to stay in place.</li>

    <li> Serves its purpose. I&#x27;m in Barber School.</li>
    <li> These neck strips are not very strong, I typically use these to mold wet hair and because they are applied to wet hair they broke easily.  They are very thin, may be ideal for other purposes but not for wrapping or molding hair.</li>

    <li> Greta value and delivered on time!</li>
