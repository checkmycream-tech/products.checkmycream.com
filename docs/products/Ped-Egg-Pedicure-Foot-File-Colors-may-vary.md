<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look fancy (like pics and videos show)&lt;br /&gt;However, we all know, you get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the dollar amount, and the job it does, a great value.</li>
    <li> Used it one time so far and this foot file is helpfull, just have to use it softly or you can actually cut your skin. Only had it for a month.</li>
    <li> Bought this almost a year ago! Great product, durable, works super well! I would buy again if anything ever happened to the one I have!</li>
    <li> Cut me first time!!!!! Plus, my feet are NOT in bad shape.Do not buy this!!!!!! Doesn&#x27;t work!Ouch, ouch, ouch! Get out the band aids.</li>
    <li> This works best if your feet are wet after the shower. I never used the black files, because I didn&#x27;t need them after using the egg. The only problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s hard to line up the egg with its holder, and sometimes it gets stuck when I&#x27;m trying to pull them apart. I love how it holds all the dead skin in the egg, so I don&#x27;t have to lay down newspaper before I file my feet.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, if you....    1.  Hold the egg metal side up while using.  If the egg is sideways or metal side down then the skin flakes can&#x27;t collect in the resevoir.    2.  Only grate in *one* direction.  I know the instructions say grate back and forth, but I found much better results only going one way at a time.     3.  Apply pressure.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of hurting yourself, if the skin is white and calloused, it&#x27;s dead!    4.  Be patient.  The thicker the callous, the longer it will take to see results.  Smaller callouses will disappear in minutes, but larger ones might look unchanged.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the product doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. The shedding skin does not all go into the container, most of it falls on the floor, air and my hands. Not really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like the color of the Ped Egg. It works really well. I have been wanting to try one for a long time and I am glad I did. I wish I would have been using this a long time ago. I love the emery board on the bottom of the Ped Egg. It leaves your feet feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Be prepare to take an hour or two to file and smooth feet and heels. Not as easy \\&quot;as seen on tv.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t need to go into too much detail, the Ped Egg is excellent.  It looks like such a funny thing, and the idea seems almost too obvious, but it works like a charm.  I use this thing on callouses and it totally destroys them.  Works them down nice and smooth and the buffer (which is really just sandpaper) does a great job of getting it perfect.  Really easy to use, and an incredibly low risk of any damage.  You have to really rub or rub for a way long time to get any redness, for me a couple of passes and I&#x27;m done.  Great product.  The capture slot works well too.</li>
    <li> O.K people,  when I tell you that I have bad feet, I am not lying.  My feet looked like I was skipping on bricks and driving a car Flintstone style going 10 miles over the speed limit.  This item is excellent.  I thought it was a gimmick. I have been suffering with these hot dawgs for the last few years for no reason.  A cure was available.  A product that does what is says it will do?  I am impressed.  I will never again be without my ped egg. I now have smooth feet.  I will go to bed happy tonight.  And so will my husband.  He will not wake up with cuts on his legs. LOL!!!.</li>
    <li> I had a ped egg before but recently lost it. I absolutely loved my ped egg and desperately needed a new one and wanted to buy one for my friend to try as well (since I love it so much). So I ordered two of them through this company and received them. Unfortunately, there were dirty... had things stuck to the metal and such. But I figured oh well I can clean them up nicely and still use them. So after soaking them and scrubbing they were still pretty dirty. But I decided to go ahead and use them anyways. The blades were extremely dull and did not work. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY! I recommend this product, but you must go into a store a buy it to make sure it looks legitimate because this one certainty did not.</li>
    <li> Instead of an actual Ped Egg, I received a generic, knock-off \\&quot;File Egg\\&quot;.  Do not purchase this product from Amazon or especially from its affiliate \\&quot;Improving Lifestyles\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have posted pictures above so you can see exactly what I received.</li>
    <li> I wanted the Ped Egg that fits in the palm of your hand, but instead received one that has a long handle attached to the plastic part.  It is hard to use the file in the spot you want and applying more pressure for filing the thicker skin just causes a cramp in my hand and wrist.  I ended up palming the egg and dealing with the handle getting in the way. The three stars are for the file - it does a good job.</li>
    <li> hey so this thing is not the original ped egg. however, this thing works just as well and the price is low because your not paying for the brand name. my feet were all cracked and stuff and now they feel a lot better.</li>
    <li> This is such a cheap piece of plastic...  It arrived with a label on it saying \\&quot;new\\&quot;, I was skeptical.  The plastic of the egg was already damaged when I opened the plastic box.  I will use it as is and see how long it last but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I had seen on Good Morning America that this product worked, so I decided to buy it and try it out (and since I trust Good Morning America I decided to buy a bunch of them to give to my friends and family).  So I did!  And I tried it!  AND IT DOES WORK!!!  I had horribly, horribly rough heels .. horribly rough heels and it was really starting to bother me cuz it was like it snagged on my socks and footies and wore out (not kidding) the heels on my footies.  So I bought the Ped Egg and tried it out.  It takes some time (it&#x27;s not an instant thing) and I worked hard on my calloused heels with the Ped Egg and I scrubbed with it and filed the callouses and, to be very honest, by the time I finished I had pretty smooth heels, but they did hurt a bit.  But after about a week they not only didn&#x27;t hurt anymore, but they were really nice and smooth still.  And now I just give a little \\&quot;brush up\\&quot; and any new callouses are gone in a second.  It is a wonderful product!  If you&#x27;re tired of having rough, calloused heels, you will LOVE what this little product will do for you!  I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m not really sure what I received it said Ped egg on the product itself but came in only a little clear plastic bag which almost makes it seem like it was used.  I did not received any kind of packaging at all and it looks like photo copied directions.</li>
    <li> I had a callous on the side of my left heal for 3 years. The Ped Egg removed it without hurting the good skin.I recommend this product to anyone who has dead sking problems.</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about the ped egg and decided to try this, but this can&#x27;t be the real deal. It was awful. No better than the cheapest cheese grater. Do not buy this product, it doesn&#x27;t work, and may actually hurt your feet. Too bad.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. It gets the callace off your foot. I use to use the strange rock with holes in it my mom had bought for me. Honestly, the stone is capable of doing as good of a job as the ped egg, but the ped egg is simpler, faster, and way easier. Furthermore, the ped egg keeps everything pretty neat. I mean, sometimes i get too much skin off and my feet start to hurt. everything is even with the ped egg. You also get the same result at twice the speed. This product overall works as described.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! My feet were really nasty. I stand 12 hours at a time. (I work as a nurse aide) This got off all of my dry skin and they looked and felt great. The only problem with this is the edge of my heel is hard to get done.</li>
    <li> I have been using original product since long time and it was very nice...quality, finishing etc.  This present recieving product is not even 10% worthy as original product.  It is not fitting well. Finishing is horrible.  It must be cheating</li>
    <li> Ped Eggs works great...but there are a lot of counterfeit Ped Eggs being sold online that do not work. I received 3 counterfeit ones off Amazon and off Ebay. The ones sold in the stores like Walmart, Walgreens, Ross etc are the real ped eggs. The official Ped Egg box is different and does not require sciscors to open it. It has additional sales ads inside from Telebrands and the ped egg is a little darker (and best of all the real ped egg works) the counterfeit ones do not work and feel light and cheap. The real ped egg box says \\&quot;For Sale in the U.S. only...on the bottom right hand on the back of the box.  Don&#x27;t buy a Ped Egg for less than $10 or else you are probably getting the fake one just FYI!!! The fakes ones just make your feet worse.</li>
    <li> well as for me, this product worked wonders to my feet but it didn&#x27;t work at all for my mother it was like nothing.</li>
    <li> I decided to take the plunge!, you know, when you tell yourself:\\&quot;I will risk losing a couple of dollars on this thing.\\&quot; Well my questions is: Why did I not try this as soon as it came out on the market? I have never been able to get rid of my calluses at the heel area as good and even, ever!. I did use the blades and, while I could get rid of the cracked calluses I was never able to get an even and rounded finish.   With this product, my feet look like those of a newborn, I am not joking, it is true. In fact, I can&#x27;t wait for summer to come back so I can wear all my sandals without worrying about those cracked ugly looking heels again.....</li>
    <li> Just got this for Christmas, tried it out on my feet and it got rid of the flaky skin on my heels and removed a callous by my big toe that I got from my tennis shoes.   Now I have nice winter feet.. I can&#x27;t believe it! I am going to recommend these to people who need some help with their feet.. because it works.   Just make sure you follow directions on how to use, to get the best results without any owies.</li>
    <li> What a superb invention! Having entered the age of wiry eyebrows, sprouting ears and progressive lenses, I am particularly distressed by the elephant skin on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a number of efforts but they all require something that I don&#x27;t have much of: patience and discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And along came the Ped-Egg. Initially concerned that it might just be one of those infomercial throw-aways, I think it might be my new best friend forever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless it serves me, I tend to be somewhat opposed to the capitalistic system - but whoever invented this gadget deserves whatever profit they attain. I may need to do some penance if I ever find out it&#x27;s made by some kid chained to a table and I wish it was free of evil-plastic (whatever happened to Made in America? And relative to Our Environment...whatever happened to America?)...but maybe it&#x27;s from recycled source (one could only hope) - or maybe they could make it from actual eggs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gadget is incredible. As advertised: no fuss, no muss (and no pain) - and my heels look 40 years younger (without the grass stains from being barefoot...or the rusty nails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most frightening part of it: the nasty funk that you find in the collection chamber...but, with a little bit of non-petrochemical adhesive, I might be able to create an environmentally friendly lumber substitute - no more pressure treated wood for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe...just maybe...with all of the toxic chemicals I&#x27;m exposed to (the brain damage should be pretty clear), I&#x27;ll grow some extra feet and my production will compete with the success of the Ped-Egg.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 38 year old man, and I&#x27;m not embarrassed to say that this little pink callous remover really works like a charm. In a matter of minutes, I removed the callouses from my feet and it made no mess at all. There was no discomfort and the emery board is a nice touch also. For $8, this was MORE than worth it.</li>
    <li> My best friend loves it.It&#x27;s the greatest thing she&#x27;s ever had for her feet.Recommends it very highly.Great price for value.</li>
    <li> I found this product at my local drug store after having read rave reviews of it and, for $10, figured it would be worth a try.    The first time I used it, I soaked my feet in a tub with a softening agent in the water. It took some of the calluses down, but not by much.    A few days later, I decided to give it another try. I used it on my clean, completely DRY feet and the results were nothing short of miraculous!    I have had thick, hard white calluses on the balls of my feet for as long as I can remember (since junior high or maybe even earlier than that). This took care of them!     Now my feet are soft, don&#x27;t hurt as much, and I&#x27;ve recommended the Ped Egg to my mom, who has a problem with cracked heels.</li>
    <li> I just finished using this product and my feet are super soft and nice!! I could not believe all the dead skin that collected!   Just follow the instructions and you will have soft feet in NO time!!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Gentle enough to use on a tomato without breaking the skin,\\&quot; the outside of the box makes this claim as well as saying the &#x27;blades&#x27; are safe enough to use on your bare skin.

    <li> I just purchased the Ped Egg from Longs Drugs and used it. I have very had heels. It worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Seriously y&#x27;all, my feet were f&#x27;n nasty. There was a huge thick layer of callused skin on my heel that got all cracked and dirt would get suck in it because I always wear flip flops, so I&#x27;d end up with the soles of my feet being black and gross after walking around for a while. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different rasps, callus removers, emery boards and that crap. This is the only thing that works well at all! I&#x27;ve used it twice and my feet look totally normal now, not like some gross hippy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Ped Egg a million times over and haven&#x27;t had the sort of results everyone else is boasting.  The directions have been followed completely and instead of having a Ped Egg full of nice little shavings, I&#x27;ve got a leg coated in dead skin cell dust and an egg that is pretty much empty!  The calluses are much smoother now as well, but they are still there.  The top layer feels fantastic though... well, as fantastic as a callus can feel, that is.  Now, my heels are probably some of the worst ever.   I&#x27;m a 25-year-old barefoot country girl that has never had any calluses removed.  It might just be that once your heels get to a certain point, the product just won&#x27;t work.  I just know that it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible! Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money. It&#x27;s junk! It made my heels worse. I&#x27;m just going to throw it away! Do not buy this thing, you&#x27;ll just be throwing money away! Awful!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!! I saw the commercial on TV and thought yeah right another product that isn&#x27;t going to work.  When on vacation, I read the Consumer Report magazine and they rated it excellent. So I thought I&#x27;d try it. After using it once I couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement on my heels. I could of used my heels as sandpaper, they where so ragged and dry. I&#x27;ve used Ped Egg three times so far and my feet have never looked and felt so good! Highly recommended product!!</li>
    <li> i love this little egg!!!!my heels were vey caked with dead callous skin not anymore. got it off without cutting to deep, left them soft and pink like a babby&#x27;s!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great.</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg does exact what it says it will do. I am thrilled with the results. Salon quality results for a small fraction of the cost and you can use it in the comfort of your own home. I was skeptical at first, but now I am definitely a believer!</li>
    <li> but the &#x27;blades&#x27; get dull pretty quick. I try to be eco-conscious and don&#x27;t like having to replace this plastic, unnatural item over and over just to look good barefoot or in sandals. [[ASIN:B000HZ9L8K Natural Sierra Pumice Stone]] is more effective because you aren&#x27;t limited to using one flat side, you can use it at any angle...and it&#x27;s natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ped Egg is too wasteful for me and it&#x27;s not really all that great in the long run.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, a great product.  Recommended</li>
    <li> A friend told me about the Ped Egg, and how it was the first product that ever really worked on her callused feet.  I have thick calluses on my heels which sometimes crack and bleed, so I was anxious to find *anything* that would help.  I like that the shaved off skin goes in the reservoir for easy disposal, and that it takes off layers of callous without hurting my healthy skin.  I started using it after almost every shower and noticed an improvement in the callouses.  The Ped Egg never really got all the callouses off to the point that my heels were soft again, but I was happy with the improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the blade dulls after about 5-6 uses, to the point that it&#x27;s not taking off enough callous.  I bought refill blades, which work great for another 5-6 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price of replacing the blade all the time, I&#x27;m decided to go with a more expensive professional callous sander.  Maybe my feet are just extra tough, but I had hoped the Ped Egg would be the answer to my nasty heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product for the price, but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
    <li> I love Ped Egg! After the first use my feet felt soft and smooth like they haven&#x27;t been in years!   Is this the miracle foot tool that fixes everything? No, but it does what it says. I still use foot cream and I will still go to get professional pedicures, but now I won&#x27;t have to be embarrassed about my ugly cracked heels and my scaly, rough calluses on my feet. I am not a foot person but I don&#x27;t want to feel ugly because my feet are gross. I tried foot graters and sanders and pumice stones before, and I will probably still use those with this, however, NOW at least my feet don&#x27;t hurt from all those thick calluses that crack and bleed and also make my feet look ugly.    In conclusion, Ped Egg does what it says. Buy this if you have heavy calluses with dry cracked feet.    p.s. Be careful the first time you use it because you can hurt yourself if you take off too much the first time. Those cracks on my feet went all the way through the calluses and didn&#x27;t just go away because I used the Ped Egg. That takes Neosporin.</li>
    <li> love the pedegg its awesome. you could have the crustiest feet in the world but this will help a lot</li>
    <li> I am used to flat emery foot paddles, I use them all the time.  The ped egg does have a place you stick an emery on it on the outside...so ok.  BUT the inside is basically a mini cheese grater.  Not as sharp, but yeah, that&#x27;s what I would call it.  I keep my feet in good shape, and can not use this on them, but I suppose if they were calloused it would be pretty decent. I got it for $9.99 at Walgreens, so no love loss I guess.  I am not mad, or bummed out, you don&#x27;t know until you try.  I am sure someone in my family can use it.</li>
    <li> I used to have thick, dry, dead skin on my heels that was impossible to remove.  The Ped Egg removes this dead skin very easily and painlessly--incredible  how soft my heels are.  My heels were also much better after adding omega 3 fatty acids as a supplement, but this product removes the residual dead skin and leaves my heels baby soft.  I&#x27;ve tried every other type of foot file on the market and nothing beats this one.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:36663071]]Side by side comparison of [[ASIN:B001V7RNDS Dr Scholl&#x27;s Smooth My Sole Micro File]] and the [[ASIN:B00113FENI Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up thinking that they were highly similar and both did a much better job than my pumice stone at leaving my feet feeling completely smooth and soft.  (While the pumice stone is easier to use in the shower and works faster, I find that my feet always have uneven dead skin hanging off it afterwards.)  I would recommend the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s equally to the Ped Egg if they were the same price; at the moment, Amazon seems to be selling the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s for slightly cheaper.  However, I would warn that the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot file has larger openings where the skin filings could fall out and dirty your floor with dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see both foot files in action on my video review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please let me know!</li>
    <li> I inherited my father&#x27;s feet, which are legendary when it comes to calluses. As a female, I can&#x27;t get away with nasty feet and so I have fought my unfortunate genetic trait for many years with files, razors, pumice, you name it. At first, I thought the ped-egg was ridiculous and just another junky television product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong, and I admit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is as great as everyone says it is, it works wonders, and I am winning the battle of the genetically predisposed feet o&#x27; shame. I can&#x27;t walk around barefoot in a cactus field after having discovered the magical and wonderful ped-egg. I give them as gifts, I&#x27;m trying to convert the man in my life to embrace and respect the ped-egg, and I am a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, it works, it works, and yes, the shavings are equally fascinating and disgusting but you will be amazed at how effective this thing is when it comes to removing calluses.</li>
    <li> I had read good reviews for this product but had to try it myself. After just one use, there was considerable difference on my heels. Love this Ped Egg. Definetly does the trick!</li>
    <li> This honestly is one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever used.  It really only works if you apply a lot of pressure, making it an exhausting process.  Save your money, mine went into the trash.</li>
    <li> My feet are not as bad as some peoples but they do get a little dry because I wear heels alot and besides my regular pedicures, I have started using this product and it works. I would definitely recommend the ped egg, but you still need regular pedicures too.</li>
    <li> I received this a couple of days ago and was very excited to use it, in large part because of the great reviews posted here on Amazon.  At first, it did seem to work some, but like a few reviewers have posted, it did leave many spots on my feet with skin sticking upwards, even after multiple runs over them, making them look furry and torn up.  Even so, I kept persisting, and wasn&#x27;t feeling anything, until it sliced open my toe and I began bleeding all over the PedEgg and the floor.  Though they show this being safe on a balloon, it certainly wasn&#x27;t safe on my feet!  I would strongly recommend against purchasing or gifting this item, unless you want someone to cut their feet.</li>
    <li> I was in my local Kroger store on Christmas Eve&#x27;s Eve and I saw the pedegg on sale, it was pink too... My favourite colour! So, I didn&#x27;t use it until a couple days later, but when I did I was pleasantly surprised to see how well this little thing works! I had a callus on the side of my big toe, and within a few minutes the pedegg was able to scrap it away! I have a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot file that is pretty much sand paper... Well, every time I would use it, it would take some of the dried skin off, but the calluses were almost being polished. I couldn&#x27;t get rid of them for the life of me. I thought there was no way to get rid of calluses until I found the pedegg.     The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is it didn&#x27;t catch much of the dead skin. I have shavings all over my rug, BUT is that really that big of a deal? I mean the foot files do the exact thing, they get a powder of skin all over the place. So, in my humble opinion it&#x27;s not that big of a deal and you can do it in your DRY bath tub, or lie down a towel if you want to sit on the couch and do it. You&#x27;re not supposed to get your feet wet before using this product, so if you take a shower, it would be best to wait a bit before using the pedegg.     All in all, I give this product 5 stars because I used to hate to touch my feet, and I hate touching other peoples feet, but I like to feel my feet now because they are so soft and smooth. I haven&#x27;t felt my feet this smooth since I was a kid, and I&#x27;m 24 years old. So, it&#x27;s been probably 15+ years since I&#x27;ve had soft feet.     Also, lotion IS A MUST! I highly recommend using lotion after using this product. It&#x27;s important to keep that skin soft, and for the first couple of months I plan to use the pedegg once, or twice a week, but I am going to religiously put lotion on my feet every night before I go to bed. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to do this as much after a while, but I want to make sure that my skin doesn&#x27;t go back to being thick and cracked again... Ahhh the sweet victory over dried and cracked skin!</li>
    <li> This thing works! I have a terrible time with hard cracked heels and have typically used sand paper to sand down the rough skin on my feet so when I saw this on TV I thought, what the heck... give it a try.  I did and it works great! It did take a while of scrubbing the first time to get my feet smooth but I know the condition of my feet had a lot to do with that. I washed my feet after using it and put on an overnight foot cream with socks and the next morning my feet were softer than they&#x27;ve been in years. I&#x27;d like to see them come up with a PediEgg that is a bit more tougher and wouldn&#x27;t take as long to use on really tough skin but I know that if I keep up with this and do it at least once a week, I can&#x27;t see needing something stronger.  Highly recommend this product.[[ASIN:B00113FENI Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File]]</li>
    <li> this thing tore up my feet.  i&#x27;d say best not to use it on super dry feet- try a soak first.  yes, it works as easily as you see on tv, but the results are not the same.  at least not for me.  it&#x27;s like a cheese grater, only sharper!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy to ave another one of these. It is a good product and helps to keep your feet healthy.</li>
    <li> This little thing works wonders. I love it, I only wish I had it years ago, so I&#x27;m really glad I&#x27;ve finally found it.</li>
    <li> I have used the ped egg b4 and it worked every time i used it. I PURCHASED THIS PED EGG 2 OR 3 MONTHS AGO AND IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST PED EGG THAT I HAD B4, THIS ONE IS CHEAPER MADE THE FEEL IS CHEAP AND DOES NOT WORK AT ALL FOR ME. What happen to the original ped Egg? i miss the original one. My mom still has the original one and it still works she has not changed blades she does clean it b4 every use.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this for my husbands crusty feet.  He is so happy with his new soft feet.  In a matter of minutes it took off layers are cracks and dead skin.  Truley awesome.  And even cheaper than getting it at walgreens.</li>
    <li> This may be what you looking for if you have only the slightest of problem.&lt;br /&gt;But for those of us with a more difficult problem this isn&#x27;t up to the task.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just to fine a tool to get much done before you become tire of grinding&lt;br /&gt;away on your feet. There needs to be a midway point between something&lt;br /&gt;causes your feet to bleed and this delicate little tool.&lt;br /&gt;Beware</li>
    <li> I go bare foot allthe time and i get caloused feet quickly.. this is good for shaving off all those hard to poumice feet... it comes with sand paper stickers to smooth out after shaving the calouses.. get it it works.. I was told that you need to replace the grater part but i havent had to yet..</li>
    <li> I have always had very rough and calloused heels, and after a while I was desperate that I&#x27;d always have yucky feet.  My experience with the ped egg has been wonderful!  I always use it right after I get out of the shower, and then moisturize with Aquaphor lotion.  The one time I tried to use it on dry feet it hurt like hell, so I don&#x27;t recommend that at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ped egg has become part of my after-shower routine and it is definitely a gadget that I tell all my friends about.</li>
    <li> it does not work as great as i was expecting. when i opened the box, it was dusty and had scratches and i was not sure if it was used or something. i&#x27;m going to try it again, but i do not recommend buying this</li>
    <li> I have purchased the refill pack 4times. My daughters use them also. We all agree that only one blade actually works. We are being ripped off. Does anyone else know this?</li>
    <li> As with most As-Seen-On-TV products, I was skeptical at first, but figured I&#x27;d give the Ped Egg a try. I should&#x27;ve saved my money. The Ped Egg didn&#x27;t help my feet at all. Even though the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough to be effective, they are sharp enough to cause pain. So, it hurt...but didn&#x27;t help my rough, calloused feet. In fact, it actually made my condition WORSE. On the pads of my big toes, I have very rough skin. After using the Ped Egg, it shredded the skin but didn&#x27;t remove it. I ended up having to trim off the shredded skin with a cuticle scissors. I should&#x27;ve just left it alone to begin with. Unfortunately, this now means I was not only duped, but have to resort to expensive pedicures at a salon, just to have healthy smooth feet. THIS PRODUCT IS A RIPOFF, and anyone who says it works obviously doesn&#x27;t have very rough feet to begin with. The WORST ten dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent!!</li>
    <li> I found the blades got dull quickly, and after a while the unit came apart in my hand during use.  I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed.     Microplane makes a version of this product that is much better (sharper, higher quality construction, safer).  I bought it because I like the idea of the Pedi-Egg, but I saw that it just didn&#x27;t seem to be made well.   Yeah, the Microplane one costs more, but this is a case where you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Usually, I keep a wide berth between myself and the purchase of \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; products. Let&#x27;s face it, more times than not, they are junk. But, truth be told, the heels of my feet were starting to look other worldly and I was willing to try anything. I wear flip flops all day every day and the practice has offered little benefit to my feet. We are talking about a quarter inch of callous here! So, I bought the Pedegg (with the replacement blades and \\&quot;miracle repair\\&quot; lotion) as a last ditch effort to have normal looking feet without paying out the nose for a pedicure. It works! I saw a huge difference after just the first use. I highly recommend this product. It is dirt cheap and absolutely does what it says it is going to do. I have no doubt that my calloused heels will be like new again within a week or two.</li>
    <li> this is the best yet if you want to buy this do it from here because even the ones at the store arent as good..........this is a must buy.........</li>
    <li> Works like magic for cracked heels.    Just don&#x27;t use to much else it gets bad on the skin.    Once a while use gets rid of dead/dried skin layer making it super smooth.</li>
    <li> Broke within in the first couple uses.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I love how smooth and soft my feet are when I am done.  I am not able to go treat myself to pedicures on a regular basis so this is a perfect, quick easy option for me to get soft feet.   Thanks for inventing the Ped Egg!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and simple.  Buy it!  I wondered for years, \\&quot;does that thing really work?\\&quot; and finally I bought one.  It&#x27;s simply amazing!!!  At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working but kept going and then used the file enclosed with the produce - add lotion and wolla!  It looked better than after my 50.00 pedi!!!!!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh I love this thing sooooo much! I&#x27;m going to save so much money since I don&#x27;t have to pay for pedicures any more! My feet are so soft!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that it would help as I have rough feet from years of karate and sports.  Got the ped egg in the mail and tried it for the first time only to be terribly disappointed.  It was cheaply made and the packaging was messed up which already made me think it wasn&#x27;t going to be very beneficial.  So I tried it on my feet and all it did was make them worse.  It&#x27;s not battery operated so you have to file yourself and every time I moved back and forth it was making these little pieces of skin raise so my feet felt like rough sandpaper.  I&#x27;m just gonna stick with my emory file and smooth them out and throw this in the trash.</li>
    <li> I am beyond disapointed with this product.  It will not lock into place or stay closed, effectively rendering the product unusable.  After recieving the item, I wish I had read more reviews complaining of the same problem and am also leaning to the conclusion that this item is a knockoff.  Avoid at all costs.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of those things that depends on the person.  My sister also has this and LOVES it.  I don&#x27;t like it at all.  It seemed like all it did was shred the skin on the soles of my feet.  I&#x27;ll be using a pumice stone instead.</li>
    <li> I found this on Amazon for a great price and thought I would try it out. No other ones I have bought even compare to this! At first, I was doing it incorrectly and thought that I just wasted my money again. You have to be sure to file slowly while moving it up and down. It took awhile the first time because I had not correctly removed my calluses before. However, it is worth it. I will never go back to anything else!! Be sure to put lotion on your feet afterwards. :)</li>
    <li> My heels were flaky, cracked, and dry. I tried this and was really surprised that it DOES WORK to exfoliate all that gross skin! Yes the shavings do tend to fall on the floor sometimes but who cares? Do you want smoother softer feet or not? It is a non-issue to me, I just wanted a product that worked and that I wasn&#x27;t wasting my money on. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have tried using this twice and both times, I was \\&quot;sorely\\&quot; disappointed. My soles definitely did not get smoother after.     Next time I will stick to my lasource. [...]</li>
    <li> I have a friend who had one of these and loved it, the there are so many good reviews here, i finally tried one.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud or if they&#x27;ve changed this but it didn&#x27;t do much at ALL on my feet.  I&#x27;ve had luck with a Pedro callous scrubber and those black Revlon files you can get in the nail clipper section of the store.  I thought this would be neat because it would save up all the filings but I didn&#x27;t find much at ALL in the little container.  I got a lot more skin off with the emery pad part of this, but for the price, the Revlon files work better.  What a waste of money!    update - bought a store-brand metal callus reducer (metal file) at the grocery store for two bucks - works way better than this!!!</li>
    <li> package was flimsy and made me doubt the authenticity of the product.  seemed cheaply made or a cheap imitation.  oddly enough it seems to do the job ok.....i guess</li>
    <li> I would like to know what product everyone with a 5 star review got because there is no way it is the same product that I got. This is the most ridiculous and worthless product I have purchased since the sham-wow. I don&#x27;t understand all of the hype. a pumice is more effective. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg is essentially a fine grader in an egg shaped container.  Much faster than a file, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s quick to use.  1) Use the Ped Egg to remove calloused dry skin build-up.  2) Consider Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream to heal dry cracked feet.</li>
    <li> I have a callus on the bottom of my foot on the flat area (not the heels which is a common area for calluses), and I had hard time working on it using the egg shaped shaver. I had two issues with Ped Egg - I had time finding a comfortable position to work in (I had to bend in a way that made me uncomfortable) and I had trouble working on a flat area without hurting the healthy skin around the callus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Callus Reducer Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Callus Reducer 1 ea works much better for my problem. The callus reducer is a file (looks very similar to a cheese grader) that has a handle. The handle gave me a longer reach, and it does not have to be used flat, I could angle the file in such a way that I could treat only the small area on the flat part of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Callus file has two sides: one side with larger filing edges, the other with finer smaller filing edges. When you file the dead skin it creates a bit of a mess, so I use a towel under the foot being treated to catch the filings. However PedEgg created a bit of a mess two as the filing dropped out of the filing holes of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To treat my callus I start with the larger filing side Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Callus file. It work pretty quickly (a few minutes). Then I use the finer filing side to finish off and smooth. When I work on the callus that extends above the rest of the skin I can use it holding it flat. When I get to the point when I am working on a small are I use it on an angle to treat only a small area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Dr. Scholl&#x27;s file in combination with Freezon which helps to remove corns and calluses. The acid in Freezon deadens the top of the skin and starts the peeling process. After 6 days of treatment with Freezon, I soaked my foot every night and about a week after the end of the Freezone treatment the callus began to peel off. This is when I removed it with the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Callus Reducer. Once the first layer was peeled off, I still had a smaller callus remaining and had to repeat the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a problem which is not on the heels, I would suggest trying Dr.Scholl&#x27;s file. It works, it is inexpensive, and the handle makes it comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewmaller callus remaining and had to repeat the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a problem which is not on the heels, I would suggest trying Dr.Scholl&#x27;s file.

    <li> Came with plenty of replacement pads, the actual skin grater/filer has not hurt me in anyway. Not all the skin is collected, but a quick wipe with your hand and you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> I guessed it wouldn&#x27;t be the original ped egg (just payed five bucks) but i threw this thing on the trash as soon as i opened it!!! its a Chinese made useless piece of plastic... DONT BUY! (this is my first review...i think is not fair for someone to miss spend this money). Its not the same thing as the picture either!</li>
    <li> What arrived is a blissful foot pod. Does the same thing, but if you order with the replacement blades for the real Ped Egg, they are not gonna work. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I just bought one of these yesterday, and have never felt so compelled to write a review so quickly.  I have struggled with HARD calluses most of my adult life, and in fifteen years of regular pedicures (some quite expensive), no one has been able to help my feet as much as this tiny little egg did in less than three minutes for both feet.  AMAZING.  Yes, it did make a mess--it&#x27;s hard to hold it upright when you&#x27;re holding your foot at an angle, but put a towel underneath your feet!  Actually, the callus dust is strangely fascinating, albeit a bit gross.  The sound of it on dry, hard calluses is a bit intimidating at first, but once I saw how well it was working, I could&#x27;ve cared less.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever need to visit a professional again, and my feet feel as good as a baby&#x27;s!  AWESOME!</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg is ok I suppose. The first time i used it, it was great. But then when it came down to the second and third time, i had to really use some force to see some results. If you want smooth heels, you&#x27;re gunna have to work for it, even with the Ped Egg</li>
    <li> At first I pondered the meaning of the prefix, \\&quot;Ped\\&quot;. Was this an egg for children? Old men who fondle children? No. This was a foot egg. My father has an aversion towards products sold via the internet or television and would screech at the sight of my Ped Egg, so for a while after I had purchased my hard-boiled hoof helper, I was quite literally walking on eggshells. Well, eggs, actually. Well, egg, truthfully. My podiatrist was awfully upset when I explained that he had been replaced with an egg but \\&quot;That&#x27;s the way the egg splatters!\\&quot;, I told him. The Ped Egg is a joyful excursion into a new brand of knowledge for a fire-walker like myself: What it&#x27;s like to have elegant and appropriately skin-colored feet. No longer will I have to endure the hideously charred mess that is the undersides of my foundations. Everyone and their grandmother should own no less than 6 Ped Eggs, if only to experience the oozing pleasure and splendiferous feel of eggs rubbed on your feet.</li>
    <li> My heels were all nasty from standing at work all day, hiking &amp; walking, and just from being a guy. It got so bad I may have cried a little, or it was just some janky skin getting all up in my eye. Anyway, I broke down and bought a Ped Egg at a local chain store. The only color available was pink, but I&#x27;m secure enough in my sexuality to say \\&quot;screw it\\&quot; and I bought it and used it and it worked. Two 5-10 minute sessions and the majority of the cracks and that ugly yellow calloused skin is now under control. My heals are actually soft to the touch, but still look manly; I&#x27;ll keep some of the callouses for street cred. But seriously, it worked well for me, and my heels even feel better when walking.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time and am very happy with it. I received the real \\&quot;Ped Egg\\&quot; and not a knock-off. It came in a plain cardboard box--not in the plastic case, as featured--but the contents appears the same. It works a lot better than the pumice stone I had been using. In just a few minutes, it shaved down my calluses and the dry skin on my heels. I could definitely feel the difference, and there were a lot of shavings in the container to prove it. The shavings stay mostly in the Ped Egg container, but I use it over a trash can to be sure. I would definitely recommend buying it--it&#x27;s a great product at a great value.</li>
    <li> Despite the poorer quality PedEgg I received, it still works. I think people with rough, dried out, cracked feet should use this before trying any creams or even anything that exfoliates. I explained to my friend, who also has dried out heels, that in order for the creams to work effectively, the top dried out layer of skin has to be removed. If it is not removed, then the creams just sit on the top layer of dead skin. And that&#x27;s not of any help. Something like this or a pumice stone is the best bet. Then you can start to apply creams and lotions to soften and help keep the skin on your feet soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this for about 5 minutes on each foot, and I&#x27;ll continue to work on them on a daily basis. But already, my feet are smoother around my heels. Once I feel enough dead skin has come off, I&#x27;ll use the cream I have to exfoliate, and then I&#x27;ll purchase an Aloe Vera foot cream.</li>
    <li> Works great for your dry cracked feet.  Follow up with daily use of the raw African shea butter from Ghana.</li>
    <li> I love the pedi egg for keeping the dead skin off my feet. This one is cheaper than the last. The egg opens up while in use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I purchased the fake or the real one (it was the \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; one) but after a week of using it,  my heels felt like fish scales, smooth if you rub your fingers to one side and like scales if you rub it in the other direction.  It has been more than a year now that I have stopped using this device and my heels is still not back to normal. I had high hopes for this device, but alas, it was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> NOT a real ped egg- beware- cheap knock off. Returned.</li>
    <li> This product doesnt remove any skin at all. I was pressing hard on my feet with this but it just feels so dull and didnt do anything at all. I am able to remove more dead skin with my hands. Not only that, its made from an extremely cheap plastic that is molded really cheaply. Not only that, the 2 included little scrubber pads completely lost their adhesive so they didnt stick to the underside like they are supposed to. The reason its \\&quot;safe to the touch\\&quot; is because its so dull that it cant remove anything. My mom also bought the one with the handle and she says its just as bad. This product feels like something you would get at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> (purchased from a store) This thing does not work very well and it made a mess.  It is cheap plastic with a cheap punched out metal screen.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> These are okay...hard to take apart and put back together and can make a bit of a mess...taking in to consideration what is in there when you go to open it-It&#x27;s no fun(a pretty nasty) getting this everywhere. I would have returned it but I don&#x27;t think that goes well since they were both used.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> This product works great. It&#x27;s very easy to use and leaves my feet feeling so smooth. And when you&#x27;re done, you can just empty all of your nasty little feet shavings in the trash.</li>
    <li> I just want to say it removed the dead skin on my heels that I have had for months!!! I would definitely recommend it.  I was at first hesitate to buy it but I am glad I did!</li>
    <li> Amazon needs to drop this supplier.  Item received broken.  Also had skin hanging off blades and looks used/ refurbished.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product!  Very cheap and does not work at all.  I was very excited to get this product and even the packaging it came in was cheap!  I would avoid this product!</li>
    <li> The ped egg worked ok. I was plesantly surprised it actually did something, because I am a skeptic. But it did not work as well as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a walgreens actually and it was the one with the handle not just the regular ped egg. Well at first I was pretty happy with the product till after 3-4 applications I noticed my calluses worsened. They were coming back with a vengeance. Not fun at all. The first time in my life I now have cracked feet. I would not recommend this product as it shaves your heels and it should be a surgical tool. I didn&#x27;t even think about it, but I heard before if you shave or cut it it&#x27;ll just get worst. So please don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the good reviews for this item.  It took a while to get any shavings and then it leaves your feet very rough.  You have to follow up with an emery board type paper.  It seems to me that you&#x27;d get the same results by using varying grits of sandpaper.  I was not impressed by this product, and if I could, I would have given it zero stars.  I&#x27;m going back to the pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!  This product is clearly a generic possibly \\&quot;black market\\&quot; product.  You will NOT receive the actual brand name \\&quot;PED EGG\\&quot; pictured on the webpage.  The product actually received is a very cheaply made foot file in shape of an egg that is dusty on the inside.  It comes in a small cardboard and not the hard plastic package pictured.  DO NOT buy from this vendor!</li>
    <li> i got this item faster then the time it says it well come so i love it and i would really recommended this item and seller to every one i know there where good and fast. the product works really good and makes my feet and my husbands feet smooth love this product.</li>
    <li> Works fine but doesn&#x27;t do anything special compared to something less than half its price.  A little handy that it catches the shavings but doesn&#x27;t do 100% job so you still have to clean up after yourself.</li>
    <li> I have tried every foot callus remover I have come across in the past 30+ years.  This is the first one that has actually delivered.  I have such thick calluses that I can walk through gravel without feeling it.  Always have had.  Most files and rasps do absolutely nothing for me.  This actually removes the rough parts of the callus and gets rid of those ugly heel cracks.  I use this once a week.  About the \\&quot;no-mess\\&quot; claim, though... it makes a huge mess.  The mess only stays in the egg part if you use it file-side up.  I&#x27;m just not that flexible.  Dust everywhere.  I use it on the back porch and let the dust fly onto the lawn.  Much easier.  My only real gripe is that I&#x27;m having a hard time finding a replacement file for my pedegg.  I bought replacement parts (didn&#x27;t need them for about a year) and they are just too smooth to do anything for me feet.  Hope they didn&#x27;t change the product!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I gave one to my friend. He uses it often and has soft feet now.</li>
    <li> Just used my Body Toolz callus shaver for the first time, and my Pedegg is going in the trash!      If you have hard, dry, thick skin on your feet that cracks, soak your feet, pat dry, and then use a callus shaver and watch long strips of paper thin skin come peeling off.  I had to vacuum the floor after I was done with the callus shaver and now my feet are soft, pink and moist.      One caveat:  the callus shaver is much better in convex areas like heels.  Hard to use in areas that are concave.</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg I bought a few years ago - probably 2009 or 2010 - was wearing out, so I bought a new one this weekend, June 2012.  It does not work even as well as the old worn out one I am replacing.  I wonder what happened?  Did I get a bad one, or have they changed the blades so they are no longer as sharp?  I am very disappointed and there is no place on their home page to contact them directly and make an inquiry -- which is a bad sign in itself.  I had to go to several stores to even find the thing - usually a sign that they are no longer selling well, which could also be due to a cheapening of the product.  Has anyone else had this same problem?</li>
    <li> It came previously used! How disgusting is that? I am not using this product! Are you kidding me? ? ?</li>
    <li> this is definitely a knock-off of actual ped-egg  but does the trick.  make sure to use the emery pads to smooth out.</li>
    <li> This product did not work after I got it, I was disappointed. I threw it away right after I bought it.</li>
    <li> Worked amazingly, had no problems putting it together to use and then taking apart to store. Its nice how everything fits in one little compartment. Feet felt smooth , and renewed but there were some spots that I had to go other because the blade would snag, but that is me, not the egg. Great product, I would recommend getting a callus remover cream first, if you have really bad feet. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Ped Egg for several years and found it to be a great product.  My old ones were worn out so I decided to buy a new one.  These were a good price so I bought 4 of them.  Unfortunately, I was suspicious as soon as they showed up.  The packaging was a flimsy clear plastic and the metal screen in each ped egg was bent up and looked like it was made of an inferior metal material.  Also, the various pieces of these \\&quot;ped eggs\\&quot; don&#x27;t fit together correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am confident that these are poorly made counterfeit products.  My wife went to Walgreens and bought some and the packaging is very different and the quality of the Walgreens product matches the far superior quality of the ped egg that I previously owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy these fake products from this vendor.  I&#x27;m returning mine.</li>
    <li> The ped egg works well,the product arrived on time, and i am very happy with it and would recamend it over all the other similiar products i have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Richard</li>
    <li> 100 times better than any pumice stone. ive been thinking about getting one of these for over a year and finally just did it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by yours truly</li>
    <li> Aside from the infomercial, I had heard wonderful things about the Ped Egg and how great it is. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t fin this to be the case. It seemed really cheap. The plastic case was pretty cheap and the metal grater part was very thin metal.  Overall, when I used it, it did help to pull some dry skin off, but I didn&#x27;t see much difference from a pumice stone.  Plus it was a little gross to have to clean out all of the dead skin from the inside of the plastic case.  Once I opened the case, I had issues with getting the lid back on because the plastic was a misshapen. Although I wanted it to work, I&#x27;d have to recommend a pass. I&#x27;d spend the money getting a really nice pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Packaging was ripped open as if it had been used.  The ped egg itself was dirty and it DID NOT look new at all; chipped and such.  This was a Christmas gift for someone in desperate need and needless to say, I&#x27;m highly disappointed.  I&#x27;d suggest buying it in a store such as a Wal-Mart or Rite Aid.  It is a fine working product.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying a Ped Egg. I was sent a cheap knockoff from China called \\&quot;File Egg\\&quot;. It isn&#x27;t worth 50 cents. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Now I have to deal with sending it back.</li>
    <li> My fiance bought me this product today at Sally Beauty Supply. I read all the reviews on Amazon before this purchase and the majority of the reviews were very positive so I decided to give it a try. LOVE IT!!!! My feet have really been bothering me recently. I have hard skin and callouses on them and they dry up so much that it hurts. I have started using a pumice stone and that helps but this product worked wonders. I used it for the first time tonight and it was great!! I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it and make my feet sore, as some customers have mentioned, so I went easy on it. It really helped and my feet feel softer already. I am totally pleased. I am not too fussy with mess, yes some of the skin shavings came off on the carpet but it wasn&#x27;t a problem. My fiance even tried it!!! He said it made some rough spots on his feet softer too. I highly recommend it, especially if you have dry,cracked and calloused feet like mine. First I took a hot bath and soaked my feet, then i dried them a bit, then I did the pedi egg and followed with foot lotion and socks. I am going to keep doing this on a regular basis and now I won&#x27;t be embarrased to get a pedicure at my salon.Wonderful product,about $10 is a great price,convienient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> After shredding the heels of yet another pair of panty-hose I finally surrendered and went out and bought a Ped Egg.  I figured that for $9.99 it&#x27;s almost as cheap as another pair of pantyhose, and if it&#x27;s as good as they say it is, it might save me from ripping up a few dozen more pairs in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works:  The Ped Egg is shaped like an egg that&#x27;s flattened on one side and it&#x27;s about four inches long, small enough to fit into any purse.  The round side fits comfortably into the palm of your hand.  The flat side -- the business side -- looks like a mini cheese-grater and works on pretty much on the same principle.  Rub it over your heels and the graters pulverize the dry skin painlessly into so much powder.  The powder is trapped inside the Ped Egg, but as you change its position on your feet while you use it, some of the dust will fall out through the holes, so put a towel or a paper towel or a newspaper under your foot to catch any residue.  The Ped Egg comes with two oval-shaped emery pads to rub over your feet after you finish using it.  (The emery pads have an adhesive backing to adhere to the bottom cover of the Ped Egg.)  Slather on a lot of lotion at the end, and your heels will feel softer than a baby&#x27;s butt.  No kidding -- this thing really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;ve got your feet in shape with the Ped Egg, weekly maintenance (or twice a week in cold, dry weather when cracked heels are endemic) should be all that&#x27;s required.  Unless you&#x27;ve got actual scales on your feet, using it every day shouldn&#x27;t be necessary.  You can buy replacement emery pads, but actually any emery block that you pick up for a dollar in the nail care section of your local drugstore should work just as well.  One caveat: I&#x27;ve read some reviews that said people have tried the Ped Egg to smooth their elbows.  If I were you, I wouldn&#x27;t.  The skin on your elbows is much thinner than the skin on the soles of your feet and your heels, and abrading your elbows with a Ped Egg blade could be painful at best and possibly do some serious scarring.  You can try rubbing the emery pad over your elbows; I did this, and it worked fine.  Just don&#x27;t overdo it on the elbow grease (pun intended) or you&#x27;ll wind up with some sore elbows.  And slather on the lotion afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With normal use (two or three times a week), the Ped Egg blade should last you from six to eight weeks.  The replacement blades come three to a pack, and unlike the Ped Egg, the replacement blade box gives instructions on how to remove the blade to empty the egg and/or replace a new blade: hold the top cover by the sides while you squeeze the blade cartridge on both ends, and pop out the cartridge one end at a time.  After a few tries you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the Ped Egg is a great little gizmo that lives up to expectations.  I expect to save a minor fortune on panty-hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy Lindade could be painful at best and possibly do some serious scarring.

    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She held me down and used it on my tender feet. For two days it felt like I was walking on thumbtacks. You must have the hooves of a ram to need one of these things.</li>
    <li> I like this foot file but wish it would take more skin off in a short period of time.</li>
    <li> it didnt work at all. instead of smoothing my feet, made them rougher than they&#x27;ve ever been. not to mention that it&#x27;s cheaply made.    needless to say, i returned it.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy a Ped Egg a while ago but I held off because some of the reviews said how harsh it was and too rough on their skin. I finally decided to get it anyway and I am glad I did. I have only used it once so far and I can really tell a difference. My callouses and rough spots on my feet are so much better. I am glad to be able to make my feet look better at home instead of paying much more to get them done at a salon. The Ped Egg did not hurt my feet. You can press harder or softer depending on how it feels to you and how much skin you need to get off.</li>
    <li> I have paid $50.00 for pedicures that did not turn out as well as the ped egg.  My feet look great and, unlike pumice stones, my feet are not sore afterwards.  It&#x27;s really quick.  I was able to do both feet in less than 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought the Ped Egg in the grocery store on a whim.  I have very rough, dry feet.  I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it wasn&#x27;t too expensive.  I think it works as advertised for the most part.  The shape makes it easy to hold and use.  The file seems sharper than the Dr. Scholls file I had been using which makes for a quicker job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that it does not collect the shavings as the TV commercial says.  They pass right through the file as you use it.  You&#x27;d have to be upside-down for the shavings to stay inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reviewers who said their feet are rougher, I understand what they mean, but I wonder if they used the emery pads after using the file.  It&#x27;s just like using progressively finer grades of sandpaper when working with wood.  The file takes off the bulk of my callouses and the emery pad smooths it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this product, I knew I wasted my money.  My feet are not the worst, but walking all the time in shoes that can get uncomfortable left me with rough heels.  I scraped and scraped with that stupid egg, and all I got was an ache in my arm, and heels that felt worse than before. Please, don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this piece of junk!</li>
    <li> I already own a [[ASIN:B000G62I12 Tweezerman]] for callus removal.  It works pretty well (the blade does, not so much the rasp), but wanted to try the PedEgg and see if it worked better.    It doesn&#x27;t.    I was expecting the cutter to be like the [[ASIN:B00004S7V8 microplane grater/zesters]] that are so useful in kitchens for grinding fresh ginger, something that&#x27;s extremely sharp and removes a whole lot of very, very small pieces.  Instead the PedEgg&#x27;s cutter is more like a dull, coarse cheese grater.    The claim is that it \\&quot;gently removes calluses and dead skin.\\&quot;  Nope, didn&#x27;t work for me.  The cutter creates a LOT of drag, pulling hard on my calluses, and not cutting very well at all, just a smidge of material removal (regardless of whether my skin was dry or just-finished-showering-wet).  I can see where it might give the impression of smoothing out rough, cracked skin, but this would only be because it tears the surface up to where it&#x27;s all evenly roughed up.  If you&#x27;re trying to actually remove material and leave behind a smooth surface - all without dragging painfully on your skin - this is not the right tool for the job.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it really works and it works well. The only problem I have with it is that it can be difficult to take apart when trying to empty and clean out the shaved off skin.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Ped Egg products.  I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  My only warning is that I would recommend to use it over a towel or tub because not 100% of the filings get caught by the case.</li>
    <li> I excitedly purchased my Ped Egg at Walmart after my friend raved about it. To my surprise it was not at all what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s nothing more than a very dull cheese grater in a strangely shaped container. Ergonomic? No, I get a cramp in my hand from holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shavings fall out of the opening of the grater, so you will still need to put down a towel on your floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have extremely dry feet, you should not use this as it will tear the skin and you WILL bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it on moderately dry feet is okay, but it really doesn&#x27;t do very much in removing dry skin. I find that the included sandpaper does more work for me, much like the sandpaper foot files you can buy for a dollar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on this Ped Egg.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. Just be sure not to overdo and make your skin raw, and have something under you to catch the fine skin that will fall like powder.</li>
    <li> This does what it promises and I use it almost daily. Shaves off the dry hard skin on the soles of your feet.     It comes with a cover which doubles as a base so shavings can collect in there.  It is hard to pull the base off so you can wash the bits out each time and as you are using the egg the shavings shake out all over your foot anyway. It comes with some emery paper but I have no idea where to stick it. If you put it on the bottom, the most likely place, it will scratch the table when you set it down.     So I like the actual usefulness but the design could be improved.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but after using it for 5 minutes, I was sold!  Use light pressure for best results and be patient.  This will be the best $10 you ever spend.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is so stinkin&#x27; good that I had to write a review to share about it.   I have heels and feet of  a 100 year old woman.  Oh sure, the bottoms of my feet were perfect at age 25, but now at 41, they are nearly shameful!  I have tried EVERYTHING, expensive pedicures, the \\&quot;cheese-grater\\&quot; at home, sweating with a sander and a pumice.  They all helped a little but nothing, NOTHING like the Ped Egg.     I ain&#x27;t even kiddin&#x27; when I tell you that if you have dry, cracked heels and scaly skin on your feet...this is the thing for you. It took me about 15 minutes or so to use the egg and it also comes with a buffer. After the two part process, I washed my feet, used a good foot lotion and I literally have my 25 year old feet back.  AMAZING!!!      ****If you have a hard time reaching your feet or twisting your feet/angles, get the one with the extender on it.  I bought the hand held one and I&#x27;m pretty limber but it&#x27;ll be tough on someone with limited flexibility.  You can only use the egg in one direction so you have to be careful when you use it and if you can&#x27;t really get close to your feet, you will have trouble.    This thing deserves an A+++++!</li>
    <li> I received this Ped Egg as a gift and really I thought it was a hoax.  I have dry feet as well as dry skin due to living in desert climates.  Using it for the first time was simple and it really worked.  It is essentially a grater that fits in your hand.  It takes off dead skin on the bottom of your feet without any pain or using harsh treatments. I use it every other day or so and it keeps my feet from looking scaly.  This product is 100 times better than the foot file I was using.  It is easy to clean and reuse plus I don&#x27;t get my dead, flaky skin all over the place.</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if it were as good or better than the straight foot scraper that we have and it is better in some ways and not as good in others.  The straight one is a little easier for me to manage than the ped egg---and, to me, the egg is sharper.  Sometimes my foot is not as smooth as it should be.  Using the discs (that are like sandpaper, only a lot smoother) definately makes your feet feel better than if you scrape without it.  The great thing about the egg is that it holds the shavings from your feet in a neat little base.  Just don&#x27;t turn the blade side down, or you&#x27;ll have shavings to clean up!</li>
    <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because the shavings leak out when tipped but I wouldn&#x27;t know any way to improve that issue.  Otherwise this is a great product and you don&#x27;t have to spend hours with a pumice stone in the bath tub anymore.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand this product. I have very dry skin and often have thick, dried calluses on my heels and feet. The \\&quot;grater\\&quot; on the egg just ripped up the thickened skin unevenly. Though it removed skin, the end result was even more rough calluses than I had before I used it. The product is made from low quality parts. Much better versions are out there. Pass this one up and keep looking. I recommend the Microplane.</li>
    <li> these will leave your feet dry &amp; cracked.  If you wouldn&#x27;t use your cheese grater on your feet don&#x27;t buy this it&#x27;s the same thing.</li>
    <li> Thsi won&#x27;t fit my Ped Egg that I bought 1 year ago at CVS and is the actual Telebrands product. This is sold by IMPROVING LIFESTYLES and is noticeably inferior to the replacement blades from Telebrands.  The plastic is cheaper and more importantly won&#x27;t fit on my Ped EGG Professional.  You never know what your going to get sometime with Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me a Ped Egg about a year ago because my heels were really dry and cracked...and kept scratching him at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ped Egg does work pretty well but if your feet are really bad you will have to do this quite a few times obviously. And depending on how often you use this, it will get dull and then does not work very well anymore. After a few months, mine got pretty dull and didn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months ago I wanted to wear flip flops and my heels were a gross/dry mess and my Ped Egg was just too dull to work. I asked my husband if he knew where his hand sander was because I was literally going to try that on my feet. He thought that I meant the hand sanding sponge and brought me that. So I tried it out, it was a medium on one side and course on the other. I tried the course and wow, that thing was amazing. It worked better and faster than the Ped Egg because the sponge contours to your foot and has more actual sanding area. Plus I could do more than just my heels, the ball of my feet and my big toes were also a little dry and I used it on them too. Once I used the course side to get most of the big dry patches off, I used the medium side. My feet were actually really smooth then but I had my husband bring me the fine sanding sponge and I made my feet even more smooth. So what would have taken days or over a week with the Ped Egg, I was able to do in about 20 minutes with a couple sanding sponges. Plus they are cheaper and last a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I sand my feet I put either Badger Brand Healing Balm all over my feet and then a pair of socks, or some other kind of lotion(or even cooking shortening works really well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just have to use the fine sanding sponge when my heels start to get any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people don&#x27;t know that dry/cracked heels is usually genetic, instead of shedding the old skin like its supposed to it stays on your feet. If you go to a Dermologist they can prescribe you a foot cream and it basically eats away the dead skin(I discovered that when I went to the Dermotologist for a routine checkup and she looked at my heels)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wether you try the sanding sponge or use the Ped Egg, good luck and moisturizing your feet before bed and then wearing socks all night really helps.ats away the dead skin(I discovered that when I went to the Dermotologist for a routine checkup and she looked at my heels)     Wether you try the sanding sponge or use the Ped Egg, good luck and moisturizing your feet before bed and then wearing socks all night really helps.</li>
    <li> this works ok, nothing great.  They sell other types at the dollar store that work just as well.  This is poorly made with cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> OH my feet look amazing now.  I&#x27;m in the Army and in combat boots every day, so my foot... well its just not pretty. So I bought this the other day and SO MUCH HARD NASTY SKIN is gone! At first I thought this would be like a cheese grater and my foot would be in massive amount of pain and bleed, however I was very wrong. Even pressed down hard with no ill side effects.  I love this product but the one flaw I had was about 90% of my dead skin did not end up in the egg but rather my floor and bed.  But still well worth it. :D</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin all over and my feet are very dry, rough, and cracked.  I had high hopes for the Ped Egg because the apartment I live in has the worst carpet I have ever felt (berber-type crap, maybe commercial) and the rough skin on my feet sometimes hurts because of getting \\&quot;caught\\&quot; on the carpet.  So far, I have seen only the tiniest bit of change using the Ped Egg.  My feet are no softer and only a tiny bit smoother because of the emery part.  For my skin it seems the metal grater is too small to do any good.  Overall, the Ped Egg is a waste of money.  The shavings do not all stay in the egg like advertised (of course mine were smaller than sawdust) and I hardly made any progress after even 15 minutes of vigorous grating.  I will be looking for something else.  Perhaps this will work for some people, but not me.  I think it really depends on your feet and skin condition.  Also, I felt the egg was too small in size (perhaps because I have a size 11 foot, but still it could be bigger), and I was not happy I ended up with a pink one (not the fault of the product, but be aware it is a possibility).</li>
    <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve lived in fear of having my mother&#x27;s feet - gigantic callused, cracking bear claws! I&#x27;m not someone who&#x27;s super neurotic about my appearance but at a young age (17 or 18) I started developing serious calluses on my feet, and non from running around barefoot. No matter how much lotion I put on I always had calluses. I started using Miracle Foot Repair several years ago, but on its own, I needed to apply it at least twice a day.  When I first saw the pedegg I wanted to try it but somehow never got around to it. It&#x27;s fantastic! Goodbye to heels that are so callused they crack and bleed. This is a great tool and I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased through Amazon.com.  Every part of the transaction was quite satisfactory.  And the price was quite good.</li>
    <li> The perfect little filer. I walk around barefeet all day, so knew my feet were dry and scaly. I was surprised, however, how much dead skin I had on my feet. Works quickly and painlessly. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I was ecstatic to use this product for the first time - I think I over-did it because I was in pain for the first few days.  I was amazed at the results, and so quickly.  Next time I will do a little at a time!  Good product!</li>
    <li> Great for carving pumpkins!</li>
    <li> This is the best pedicure product I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I have tried a lot. I was a bit skeptical since a lot of products look great until you try them. But this worked just like it was advertised.  I will never need to go to the salon for a pedicure again    I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I was expecting some sort of state of the art technology, but it&#x27;s just a regular old foot file you.  It is easy to hold with the egg shape though.  Different kind of contraption.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely particular about how my feet look -- in fact, my friends and family tease me, because I&#x27;m obsessed with keeping them soft and \\&quot;cute.\\&quot; So, when I saw the Ped Egg advertised on television, I was intrigued... yet skeptical. However, after seeing glowing reviews of the product online from various objective sources, I decided to give it a try -- and, wow, am I glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the name of full disclosure, my feet were in good shape before I started using the Ped Egg; that said, the Ped Egg has made them much easier to maintain and the silky smoothness of my heels lasts longer, because the calluses and dead skin have actually been removed, as opposed to just moisturized. Now, instead of showing signs of roughness at the end of the day, they stay looking as though I&#x27;ve just had a fresh pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may argue that similar results could be gained from using a pumice stone -- but those have to be used in the shower or bath, whereas the Ped Egg can be used anytime and anywhere you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As promised, the PE is safe to the touch, like a dull cheese grater. Somehow, it does the trick, anyway. And thanks to the ingenious design, shavings really are contained within the Egg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion for getting the most out of this product, is to follow its use with some shea butter and a pair of thick socks. Before you know it, your feet will be ready to greet the world. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I finally used this product. Perhaps my feet aren&#x27;t bad enough to have really made a difference but it worked okay at best. It&#x27;s not much better than the foot exfoliators you can buy at any CVS and it certainly did not \\&quot;trap\\&quot; all the filings as most of them ended up on my floor. It takes a long time to really scrape off all the dead skin and I don&#x27;t actually have tough calluses, just heels that no longer felt smooth. When I did begin to finally see newer skin my heels were quite pink. I really wanted to like this product but I will continue in my search to give myself a great home pedicure. I guess it&#x27;s worth ten bucks but certainly no rave reviews.</li>
    <li> I had looked into this product before buying it and am really disappointed. I have dry/cracked feet and thought using this product would make my feet smooth, when it fact it made things worse. It wasn&#x27;t until 2 days later that I looked at my feet and was shocked. Parts of my feet had different layers of skin and the top part of the bottom of my foot was kind of red. Everyone is saying it&#x27;s such a good product, but it ended up hurting my feet. I had to walk around bare foot because it hurt to wear socks and touch the sore spots. I will no longer use this product in the future. For those of you who want to try it, you should definately only use it on a certain area first and wait to see the results in a few days. Sure when I used it there was a lot of dead skin taken off, but it didn&#x27;t help my feet any. If I could go back I would have never bought it and I would rather go to the salon to get a pedicure. Beware of this product!</li>
    <li> Great product, its better than the one that originally was popular on tv. Already lasted a month and still happy with it. The original egg thing that was popular back in the day really was lack luster within a few weeks. Very happy with this product.  I am a dude who&#x27;s wife would complain about my feet being rough and now that is no longer the case. Thats all the info i got.</li>
    <li> I have very mixed feelings about the ped egg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The shape makes it very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It is easy to empty out and clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The file part will get results IF you are willing to put forth the effort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The file is not strong enough. At times it feels like i am filing to no avail. And my feel are not in bad condition. I would hate to think of the effort someone with bad feet would have to go through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*While it is easy to clean, the file does get clogged up easily. So it does require getting cleaned with a wet paper towel frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The buffer that is on the bottom of the ped egg does absolutly nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all i think this product does work, and it worth it to buy. But don&#x27;t expect to clean off dead skin with just one swipe of the ped egg.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time! Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I get calluses a lot, and this takes care of it.</li>
    <li> I saw this gadget several times before I bought it.  I was concerned about rubbing a product that looked like a cheese grater over my heels and the balls of my feet.  I was positive that it would hurt and make my feet bleed, but it doesn&#x27;t.   (my heels by the way were tough with thick skin and my partner had thick callouses on the outsides of his toes.) I bought two, one for each of us for proper hygiene, and we both appreciate the results that this product gives us. I use this about once a week to 10 days BEFORE I get in the shower so that all over the bottom of my feet (except the arch) are smoother and more attractive in open-heeled shoes.  I continue to be amazed at the amount of dead skin this removes.  My feet aren&#x27;t too smooth to the touch after this, so I use pumice in the shower to smooth out the residual roughness. In my opinion, this is a critical step.  I have not tried the emery sheets that it came with.    On thick calluses that form in other places, this product works equally well.  With persistent, regular use, the callouses disappear, and shoes are much more comfortable to wear and fit better.     This might be the most effective gadget I have bought for under 10 dollars, and I have recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> I normally get pedicures every couple of weeks, but when I attempting to go on a budget, my poor feet suffered the consequences.  My husband, who is used to me having smooth feet, suggest I try the Ped-Egg.  I needed to get my feet in good shape for my brother&#x27;s wedding so that I could wear my open-toed strappy heels.  So I decided (somewhat reluctantly) to purchase this in an attempt to save money.  After showering, with clean and dry feet, I gave the Ped-Egg a try - and I am so glad I did!  I cannot believe how much smoother my feet are after using this product!  The first time I saw it, I thought it would be horrible since it looks like a cheese grater, but it did wonders for my poor feet.  I&#x27;ve only used it once and the results were amazing.  My brother&#x27;s wedding is not until next week (I tried this out early just in case it was horrible I would still have time to get a pedicure) and I plan on using this a few more times before then for the smoothest possible feet.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it - well work the few bucks you&#x27;re going to spend on it - and much cheaper than a regular pedicure!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00113FENI Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File]]&lt;br /&gt;This product is simply wonderful. My feet were not that bad, but, after only a couple of minutes, my feet look wonderful and are incredibly soft. Yes, as others have said, there is somewhat of a challenge to collect all of the \\&quot;shavings\\&quot;--the dry skin that comes off, but I just used it over a small trashcan in my bathroom. It&#x27;s much easier and safer to use than a blade, and you don&#x27;t have to get into the shower or get your feet wet to use it (in fact, you shouldn&#x27;t). I&#x27;m not one to buy into the t.v. hype of products like these, but I am sold with this one.</li>
    <li> The pedegg does exactly what they say it will do.  It is basically a footfile that collects the shaved off skin.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but I am about to buy my second one, so obviously I like it.  You have to be careful to not hold it sideways when you use it or the shavings fall back out.  My nly complaint is that the blades dull very quickly, but you can get replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Regarding:  [[ASIN:B00113FENI Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File]]    I actually have been making fun of their commercials - calling their product a cheese grater and thinking that it would simply slice chunks off your feet.    Well, I found out a reliable friend has one, and love it... so I thought that I&#x27;d give it a try.    My feet are in terrible condition.  The cracks in my heels have their own cracks and dry skin - yech!  So, I used the egg as described and the skin came off easily (you have to hold it right and cut back-and-forth lengthwise or otherwise you&#x27;ll get cut) and painlessly.  After the first use there was a very noticeable difference.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see what they look like tomorrow morning (I added some heel healing creme and socks for the night).    The clean up was easy, and I did not have any problems with spills.  However, those with weak stomachs may find an aversion to grated Parmesan cheese for awhile.</li>
    <li> It seems like something that wouldn&#x27;t work, but it&#x27;s actually a miracle!  The inner parts of my soles and big toes were getting so dry, the became yellow and tough. I tried everything! I have every kind of foot lotion you could imagine and nothing worked.  So i finally used the Pedegg and it was amazing! After just fifteen minutes of use, the toughness began to go down and now it doesn&#x27;t hurt to walk anymore! (Yes, that&#x27;s how bad they were! It hurt me so much!)  Plus, it seems like a cheese grater for your foot would hurt and burn, but it&#x27;s painless!!  The only flaw is that if you have used this several times without emptying the shavings, the old dry skin will fall onto your foot as you use it. It&#x27;s gross...but if you empty it every now and then it&#x27;s great!  I highly reccomend it! It isn&#x27;t too late to have great feet!</li>
    <li> My purchase came from Reiss Innovations.  The packaging (distinguished by suspiciously faded printing) indicated that this is a real PedEgg. (I have discarded the package.)   However the item itself bears no logo.  Once the Egg is assembled, you&#x27;re supposed to take it apart after each use to empty. However, it is impossible to open this item without a screwdriver or other implement.  You&#x27;re supposed to glue the emery pads to the bottom--but there&#x27;s no adhesive on the pads.  Most important, this device simply doesn&#x27;t work.  The blade--which looks bumpy and poorly made--is a DUD.  It does nothing.  After trying this purchase, I went to my local drugstore and bought a PedEgg.  Same package, but bright print.  Logo on the Egg.  And actually a different shape.  Drugstore Egg came with instructions, which my purchase did not.  It&#x27;s easy to snap open and shut. Emery pads have strong adhesive.  The blade looks smooth and well-made and --voila--does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The only conclusion I can reach is that the item I received is a counterfeit.</li>
    <li> Great. Works exactly like it should. I wish it was a little sharper but, it gets the job done. Smooth transaction by the seller. I got it immediately.</li>
    <li> I suffer from tough, cracked, dry feet. The Ped Egg gently files the dead skin off.This product lives up to its promises.</li>
    <li> This item is really cheaply made, and so I have trouble keeping it snapped together for storage. Nevertheless, it holds together fine during use so far, and it seems to do a good job even on my tough, years-old calluses. They aren&#x27;t gone yet as I don&#x27;t like to take too much off at once, but they are greatly reduced already after just a few quick uses. It definitely is more effective than all the pumice stones and the foot files I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this!  It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It did absolutely nothing.  Also, they sell this exact model at Dollar Tree.  If you really want to buy it, get it there for a dollar.</li>
    <li> This really works. I have a file that I&#x27;ve used for a while and it gets clogged. During the summer it is dry here and so the feet need some love. This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found period.</li>
    <li> false advertising! I recieved a totally dif. Pedi egg than the one pictured. It was not even in a package, but simply placed into a card board box, (disgusting and cheap looking as I wanted to give this as a present ) BBW of false advertising the product you will recieve is not the product pictured!</li>
    <li> It was less then useless for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It hardly filed and quite cheap..</li>
    <li> just as the title states, this product is amazing and it works wonders. after the first try, my feet were looking better and all it took was for me to soften my feet so i took a shower first. I would definitely buy the same one again when my blade needs to be replaced</li>
    <li> Pedicures can get expensive depending on how often you go. (Although, nothing beats someone else rubbing your feet!) In between visits, I use my Ped Egg. I love it so much that I bought my sister one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as seen on tv type product when I could no longer stand the rough, dry texture of my feet. I wear shoes only when I leave the house, and after 40+ years of doing so, both my heels were rough, dry and cracking. After only a few days of using the Egg, I cannot believe the difference in my feet. They are so much softer, and feel so much better. I am not 100% sold on the fact that the shavings remain in the egg, but I can live with doing this over a towel because the end result is so good. Directions are lacking in the packaging, but are easy enough to figure out on your own (and be reading these reviews). I suggest doing the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; in small doses to avoid irritating your feet. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the ped egg with the sof feet callus remover as it is far superior. This is a cheese grater for your foot and only allows you to grate in one direction that doesn&#x27;t accommodate for crevices and the like. It also leaves the shaved area rough and serrated, and I&#x27;ve cut myself very badly on numerous occasions.</li>
    <li> It works, but not the way that it should. Very unsatisfactory for someone who works a lot and has hard feet</li>
    <li> Beware that the phrase \\&quot;colors may vary\\&quot; actually means thast the TYPE of the ped egg you will receive may vary. Thus, I expected to get the original item, but got the platinum one (with 5 Emery pads and only 1 blade inside the ped egg itself). Provided I don&#x27;t use the emery pads that much - a useless bonus.&lt;br /&gt;So, just expect a surprise :)</li>
    <li> I clicked on the link because it said it was a Ped Egg. But when I took a closer look at the picture I saw that it was actually a Blissful Feet brand NOT a PED EGG brand. It was only 5 bucks so I decided to go ahead with it because most of the ratings were still pretty good. Don&#x27;t even waste the 5 dollars! It was so dull it did nothing but made my feet worse! I tried turning the egg every way possible to get it to rub stuff off but it just wasn&#x27;t sharp at all. I would recommend just paying the extra money and buy an actual Ped Egg. It will save you money and the frustration! This is a horrible item.</li>
    <li> You have to work at it for a little while. It does make your feet softer, but not what i expected. Its an ok product.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. My feet had accumulated so much dead skin over the winter season.  I was just about to go to get a professional MAJOR pedicure...yet I was skeptical because I knew they would talk about how bad the bottom of my feet was in a language that I could not understand.  I bought this product from a major retailer...and it saved me SOOOO much more money.  I LOVE IT.  It is my new \\&quot;pedicure in an instant\\&quot; product.</li>
    <li> Everything about this item screamed fake: the packaging plastic was flimsy, looks like they&#x27;ve color copied the packaging paper from the original, the ped egg inside had dirt marks all over and had a very unfinished look to it.  I&#x27;ve never seen the original but it&#x27;s very clear that the one I was sent is clearly a very very cheap fake.  I read some negative reviews about cheap fakes from the vendor Improved(ing?) Lifestyles so I bought it from Reiss Innovations LLC -- in vain.  I&#x27;m scared to use this subpar product and I&#x27;m throwing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. I get really embarrassed by my heels because they&#x27;re so dry and no matter how much lotion or heel cream I use they just get cracked and hard. With the ped egg I can at least make them look like they&#x27;re not nasty.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this Ped Egg straight from Amazon is the real thing, as I received it rusty and bent.  I am very unhappy with this product and will never use it as I am not sure if it is even sanitary and I would rather not grind rust into my foot. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I had a TON of calluses etc. and was able to remove everything with the Ped Egg!  It was a smooth, super easy, painless process.  I really recommend this product to anyone who wants smooth feet without the costs of a professional pedicure!</li>
    <li> Finally bought it after a few weeks of consideration. Always thought my foot scrub would do the trick but decided I needed something more effective.  It&#x27;s easy to put together and really easy to use :) No regrets in buying it. The blades that I thought looked rather sharp aren&#x27;t at all, and they glide smoothly on the rougher bits of skin. Shaved down the rough skin quite well! The emery boards are a nice addition, too.  I love the ergonomic shape and the small size of it; makes it convenient to use anywhere. It traps the shavings well and is easy to clean.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic feels a little cheap. Still, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and I&#x27;m happy I finally got it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s different from the origninal one I got from boots, very disappointed, I even paid more money to make sure I got the authentic one..........................................</li>
    <li> this felt more like a grater..too course and the \\&quot;shavings\\&quot; came out with the back and forth movement.  Guess I&#x27;ll save for more frequent pedicures at the salon or just use the file type product in between.  Disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Even better than going to a salon...thought this would just be some sort of gimmick...I was wrong...</li>
    <li> Works Great!  The only con is that the shavings don&#x27;t all get trapped in the egg as described in the ad.  I had shaving all over the place the first time I used it.  Overall GREAT product.  I would suggest this to anyone with dry cracked heels.</li>
    <li> All summer I&#x27;ve been suffering from dry, peeling skin on the soles of my feet that despite my best effort was getting worse. Finally, not wanting to go for a pedicure with the my feet looking so embarrassing, I bought the Ped Egg for nine bucks, not expecting much.     Well, I had the shock of a life time. I got home, opened it and went to work on my feet right away. Five minutes later not only was the dry skin gone, the callouses on my heels and big tose were gone as well. My feet are soft and amazing! It&#x27;s a total transformation. I honestly have never gotten results this good even at a salon. I&#x27;m sold. This thing works.    It was painless, INEXPENSIVE and quick. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> This product works GREAT!!! But I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I can just buy the filing part at Walmart for $2 and thats all you really need b/c when u use the sharp parts it&#x27;ll feel smooth for awhile but then after a couple days it&#x27;ll feel uneven from the rest of your foot.</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg is basically a rasp contained in a cute ergonomically designed container that is easily held in your hand.  I like that the skin that comes off is contained neatly in the bottom of the Ped Egg and thus not all over the floor. The product itself is great and works as promised.  I walk a lot and my heels are dry and cracked; this little contraption has made a huge difference in them, they are becoming smooth and girly again.</li>
    <li> The file works great.  The fact that it catches the skin flakes makes it superior than any product that I have ever used.  I bought this egg as a replacement for one that I had for years and misplaced.  The reason I have only given it a 3 rating is that I have to use a screwdriver to pry the file component from the catch case which has a tendency to spill the aforementioned skin flakes all over the room.  Don&#x27;t know what they are doing different in the manufacturing but it&#x27;s not an improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this little helper! Cracked heels run in my family. (Thanks Mom!) I would classify my heels as moderately cracked, not really bad but not good looking in sandals. I had a pedicure once when they used the razor on my feet. My feet were never softer. I bought the razor for this use at Walmart and used a few times. It is very dangerous, as you can imagine, for someone who has had no instruction on how to use properly. I am happy to say I never really injured myself seriously but did cut a little too deep a few times!  I hate buying &#x27;as seen on TV&#x27; items, they always seem a little too good to be true! I am very happy I gave this one a try.   +It is clean, no shavings to pick up (just like the advertisement says)  +You can use it all over your feet (including side of big toe and other common callous areas  +It really gets your feet smooth (just like the advertisement says)  I definately recommend this product although I cannot comment on how long the blade lasts.  I have owned it for 3-4 months and have used 4-5 times.  It is still working well so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim at the drugstore because I&#x27;ve been too embarassed to wear sandals yet and this is a keeper!  I&#x27;m a teacher so I&#x27;m on my feet all day so they aren&#x27;t in the greatest shape.  I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was.  I followed the directions and slathered on lotion after and my feet feel fantastic!  Definitely ready for summer!  In under ten minutes.</li>
    <li> Made of cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my other ped egg, the plastic is flimsy and the two halves don&#x27;t easily fit together as with my original.&lt;br /&gt;Like others have mentioned, avoid buying this online and go to a store where you can easily inspect the product&#x27;s material.</li>
    <li> This was my first Ped Egg, and I had no idea how much time I&#x27;d spend with it after its initial use.  In my experience, a weekly session produces good results.  That doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable.  I recommend it, assuming that you&#x27;re willing to put in the necessary time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item since it had so many rave reviews by so many people.  I have to agree, the product works really well.  My only real complaint is that there were no instructions with the item.  So, I did not know that it is best not to soak your feet first and to just file on dry feet. A lot of the shavings are collected, but not all of them so you may want to have a towel handy.  Also, it took a while and different tries to get my feet really soft, but well worth the investment! My feet had terrible calluses near my big toe and my heels were quite cracked...but not anymore. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have only written a handful of amazon reviews, but I have to review this.  I&#x27;ve had horrible heels for the last 5 years ... massive calluses, huge cracks running all through them ... and I couldn&#x27;t get rid of them.  I tried regular lotion + pumice stone&#x27;ing in the shower and multiple, regular pedicures.  These all helped a bit but the calluses kept coming back and &#x27;reforming&#x27; the cracks (gross I know!)    The results I&#x27;ve gotten with the ped egg in ONE use is 10x better than the results of all these other efforts I&#x27;ve tried over 5 years.  It just works.  My heels actually look like \\&quot;normal people heels\\&quot; as my wife just said.      Best $20 bucks I&#x27;ve ever spent.    Recommendation: although it says to use on dry feet, I&#x27;ve found better results with some pre-soaking to soften up (then I towel off so it is dry, but softened).    If you have heel/foot callus issues, buy this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I don&#x27;t go out and have professional pedicures often, I&#x27;m not big on people touching my feet.  This works very well, much better than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Since most reviews seem to be female based, here is a man&#x27;s. Men, don&#x27;t overlook this great product!  I have been in martial arts for years and noticed my right foot getting a callus that was getting thicker every year. Being a man, I didn&#x27;t want to do anything about it and just let it go. That is, until it started cracking and hindering my performance level. Then I had to do something about it. I tried pummus and files and nothing seemed to keep it from cracking. I&#x27;ve seen many infomercials of the ped egg and always thought it was girly. I say a blue one at Walgreens and said what the heck, I might as well.  First use, I filled the thing! I couldn&#x27;t believe how much callus this thing shaved off! Then I used my own sander to smooth it all down, washed it, and used a high healing lotion for severe dry skin. I tell you what! My feet havn&#x27;t been this smooth since I was a teen and am 34 now!  Here is a hint: don&#x27;t go all manly and try to shave the entire callus off! Take it easy, use once or twice a week and use a lotion for healing. The more you do that, the quicker your skin adapts and less chance of the callus coming back. There are only a few spots on my foot that are still thick now! I&#x27;m loving it and can perform better in my martial arts. Thank you ped egg!</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg is truly an amazing product at a great price.  I ordered one based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  It is easy to use and leaves you feeling like you just had a pedicure.  It smoothes my dry, cracked heels and my feet in general.  I have tried expensive creams for my cracked heels and it softened but did not help the cracking.  This product really works!  It is neat and tidy, the \\&quot;shavings\\&quot; are deposited inside the egg for emptying into the trash bin (you&#x27;ll be amazed!)  The bottom of the egg has a stick-on emery board attachment for smoothing your feet all over.  I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry feet, callouses or thick skin patches on their feet.  The Ped Egg will work wonders for you!</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File is a simple design that functions perfectly. It is made to remove calluses, and it does so better and faster than any tool I have ever purchased at any price. (And I have purchased a lot of them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is simple, very easy and comfortable to handle. It performs exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is one of those \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; products, I&#x27;ll also tell you that I was absolutely shocked that it performed so well. I would definitely buy this product again, and recommend it to a friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!</li>
    <li> This product sort of does what it advertises, but I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  I used it a couple times and it did shave off dead skin.  However, the skin went all over the floor and not just into the egg so I had to clean up a mess.  Then, I felt like later on it left my feet looking bad and not as nice as they should.  So the next morning I used my cheap $2.99 pumice stone from the store and fixed what the pedegg did to my feet.  I have been using my pumice stone ever since and been very satisfied.  The pedegg went in the garbage.</li>
    <li> this thing rocks if your feet are in bad shape. i doubt it would be useful to people with very light calluses. be careful not to go overboard this thing is basically a cheese grater. make sure to use a regular foot file after you&#x27;re done, this will do the heavy work, but a smooth file after will leave your feet oh so suckable.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything from sandpaper, electric sanders, pumice stones, rasps, etc.  The Ped Egg is the best by far.  I recommend to anyone with cracked, dried sore feet.  After removing the thick callus rub in a good foot cream such as Tripod.  A+ product</li>
    <li> This Pedegg doesn&#x27;t work very well, only removing a very small amount of dead skin. A good pumice stone works much better for me and probably for you as well.</li>
    <li> This makes my feet feel even worse than they did before! This product is awful. Dont waste your money or your time.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve had extremely dry skin since I was a kid.  My heels are in terrible condition and I was really amazed when the ped egg smoothed out all cracks with little effort!  My only issue with this product is that the blades really dont last very long.  After only a few uses, I&#x27;ve already had to reorder replacement blades.  But this is absolutely minor considering how wonderfully this product works.  It is also very gentle so there&#x27;s no chance of cutting yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought the \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; Ped Egg (because it is bigger) and I love it!  It really does work!  I used to be able to scratch my mosquito bites on my legs with the heels of my feet.  Rather frustrating now because that does not work anymore.  LOL  My heels are waaaaaay too smooth!</li>
    <li> I just really love these!!!!  This is probably my fifth one in the past few years.........really works!!!  They do get dull after awhile but so do knives  : )</li>
    <li> With all the \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; products out there with dubious performance issues, the Ped Egg is the one that actually does what is says. I looove my Ped Egg - use it regularly to keep my feel smooth in between a professional pedicures (a bi-monthly splurge). No problem or complaints at all.</li>
    <li> Great for your Feet !</li>
    <li> This product is great! It really does work. My feet are so smooth after just a few minutes of use. And it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Despite the advertisement that raves about this product, I did not find the Ped Egg to be very effective at all. I used it once and put it away, don&#x27;t even know where it is anymore</li>
    <li> seems to work all right but \\&quot;version\\&quot; I got may not the true PedEgg brand as it came intact in a thin cardboard box (labeled \\&quot;How One\\&quot;) instead of sealed hard plastic and the blade seemed a little rusty like may have been stored somewhere too moist. I noticed it is stamped \\&quot;PedEgg Professional\\&quot; but the plastic parts do not fit as snug together as one would expect. still, it does \\&quot;shave\\&quot; off dead skin without discomfort but I doubt it will hold up to much use. good concept but I am a bit disappointed in quality of actual product.</li>
    <li> The price probably should have been a clue, but I ordered it anyway after trying out my mum-in-law&#x27;s REAL Ped-egg. upon arrival, the box looked like something you&#x27;d pick up for a dollar in a store in Chinatown- the brand name Ped-egg could not be found on the box at all.   This one, compared to the real one we have,  is made of a cheaper plastic. It&#x27;s noticeably cheaper construction: instead of clean lines where the plastic meets the metal scraper head, this one has plastic \\&quot;wings\\&quot; for lack of a better term- where little bits of plastic squished out around the mould during the manufacture process.  The blade head itself has a rust stain across it which was easily taken care of with some sanding and scrubbing. We&#x27;ll see if this becomes an issue later on with repeated washings.  These things being said, it still does what the ped-egg does with the same efficiency, ease-of-use, and safety (won&#x27;t rip up your skin, like the real ped-egg advertises.)  I gave it four stars because, as I said- it still does the same thing. I got it for $7, with free shipping. I can&#x27;t complain too much, just be aware this isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
    <li> I think buy now, everyone knows how amazing this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price for item.  Good delivery, arrived on time and intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every week.  I love opening it up and seeing what is inside.</li>
    <li> it got here late by 2 weeks. customer service called to ask if i got it yet cause i complained but did not leave a number to call back at. then i finally got it and the ped egg package was bent up. then it only sort of works i still have to use a foot stone to smooth it out.</li>
    <li> did not work well like the one I purchases a year ago from another place... i do not like this one at all.</li>
    <li> Reviews are so that everyone can share their opinion.  Mine is that this nifty little ped egg didn&#x27;t work for me.  Yes, I put it together and used it correctly, I just didn&#x27;t find that it got my feet much smoother.  I haven&#x27;t used it since I first got it.</li>
    <li> i have this item it safe and easy to use do not buy or use a credo blade it make your feet get worse beware of foot spa!   ps. if you dont like blades get a pumice stone or foot pads for your feet the doctor recommend this.</li>
    <li> It is very helpful for the dead skin under your feet. Don&#x27;t be too ambitious. Start gentle. After several weeks, you can see a clear improvement. Don&#x27;t forget to apply a generous lotion afterwards.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THESE!!! They are very cheaply made, and there are much better options out there. The little latch that holds the egg together while you file is a piece of crap. The thing split open three times while I was using it, spreading disgusting food dust all over my room.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a Ped Egg brand product as shown - it&#x27;s a cheap piece of crap.  \\&quot;Blissful Feet Pod\\&quot; by TeeVee Brands.  This does NOT work with the Ped Egg blades that are a suggested bundle.  This seller needs to be booted from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered the ped egg but recieved a \\&quot;perfect pedi\\&quot; cheap knockoff with a self attached \\&quot;ped egg\\&quot; sticker from the merchant. Basically they did not send me what I ordered.  The product did absolutely nothing except leave scratch marks on my caluses instead of smothing them.  After rubbing at them with the fake ped egg for 5 minutes there were not even any shavings in the container.</li>
    <li> For the cheap price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this stocking stuffer purchase, but I must say it was amazingly effective. I usually don&#x27;t leave product reviews, but I&#x27;ve gotta give this product it&#x27;s props. I used this on very calloused and cracked feet, and it really did the job. I&#x27;d call it the foot grated, not the foot file, but that probably wouldn&#x27;t have the same marketing appeal. Took off maybe 1/4 inch of callouses on the heel alone.  The metal face looks in fact, like a cheese grater, but true to it&#x27;s claim, it does leaves normal soft skin intact and unscratched unless you get carried away. This was much more effective than a pumice stone or emery board, or heck, even sandpaper.     It works fine for less thick areas, but for thicker spots I&#x27;d recommend not taking too much off at once, but waiting a few days between uses. After a week of use I must say there was a night and day difference. One slightly annoying thing is the claim that all the shavings are captured in the body of the product for easy disposal. Sorry, but this product will create a mess if you&#x27;re using it on thick skin.</li>
    <li> cheap and really bad knockoff. The blade side is nothing like the original&#x27;s microplane filer. This product simply does not work.</li>
    <li> If I had paid more than $6 for it, I would be sending it back. The quality of this is horrible. Made is a DISCOUNT Chinese factory no doubt. It had pieces of plastic sticking out of it where the original mold injection happened, the grate that scrubs your foot had metal shavings poking out that were not meant to be there. I had to do quite some work to it to get the product to be where it should have been out of the box so it didn&#x27;t cut my foot. Having said that, it does work at gently scraping off dead skin. Its very slow but not painful in the least and likely a useful product. Its only getting two stars from me because I feel I had to re-manufacture half of it once I took it out of the box.</li>
    <li> I bought the Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File on the recommendation of my salon stylist. I have unusually dry, cracking tough skin on the bottom of my feet. I normally use the Trim® Neat Feet(tm) Callus/Corn Shaver that my podiatrist recommended a few years ago, but wanted to try something \\&quot;gentler.\\&quot; The Trim® Neat Feet(tm) Callus/Corn Shaver is amazing and does a fantastic job removing the tough skin patches. Unfortunately the Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File removed absolutely nothing from my feet. In fact, all it did was leave the smooth, tough patches feeling rough and scratchy. The two emery \\&quot;stickers\\&quot; that came with this Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File were completely used up in one application. I regret buying the Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File and wanted to share my experience with others who may be considering buying it. I typically order more than three items from Amazon per week and this is only about the fourth review I&#x27;ve written since I placed my first order on Nov. 13, 2000. This should give you an idea about how strong my (negative) opinion is of the Ped Egg. I gave it one star because there was no option to give it zero.</li>
    <li> I have had pedicures several times.. I have purchased many other types of files to get the callouses off of my feet and nothing compares to this product.  I highly recommend it.. no more banging the file to get the callous dust off so you can keep going.. It just works well... my daughter even tested it against the balloon to see if it would pop. LOL!  It doesnt pop the balloon, but wow does it take care of your feet!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:20960931]]This is one of many As Seen On TV video product reviews you can see for yourself, for free, [...]</li>
    <li> I have had calluuses and dry skin ever since I was in high school. I have spent so much money on drug-store exfoliating creams, scrubs and tools. They never worked for me. I had the best results from pedicures, but I couldnt find the time to do them often. IT seemed that I needed one each week.  After I saw the ad on T.V. I thought it sounded too good to be true. When I tried it I was astonished at how well it works the very first time! You use the the \\&quot;Cheese grater\\&quot; first, then the foot file.I use it twice a week now and I highly recommend this product.  i am going to buy another one, since I got my money&#x27;s worth from this one.</li>
    <li> I am a guy who wears sandals a lot. My feet are thus prone to drying out and cracking. So, I used to use a traditional heel file with metal dimples and an emery board. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the Ped Egg but as with most \\&quot;Order now!\\&quot; commercials, you never can be really sure if it&#x27;s going to be a good product or complete suck. So I bought a Ped Egg and waited a few weeks for my heels to get good and solid/calloused, with lots of deep cracks and other grossness that goes with unkempt sandal heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Ped Egg, I got my heels done in about two minutes. About sixty-seconds per foot. Heels soft, callouses gone, no irritation or soreness. Absolutely brilliant! With my old method, it would take at least an hour to get these kinds of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an unbelievably good product!</li>
    <li> I have to admit I am the first to be very suspicious about an \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; product (I used to be in this business.)  But, the Ped Egg really delivers a lot for the money.  It won&#x27;t cure your dry feet, but it will safely remove an awful lot of dry skin.  Just follow the simple instructions- you can&#x27;t hurt yourself.    Some advice:  1) use only on dry feet (don&#x27;t use this item after you bath/shower.)  2) move the device ONLY forward and backwards.  3) beware of the dry skin particles falling out of the blade holes (hold it upside down or on its side at all times.)  4) use daily for best results (it&#x27;ll remove a little every time.)  5)  be careful around blisters and open sores (but you knew this anyway...) 6) use lubriderm skin lotion once you&#x27;re done.    I paid[...] for this item delivered through amazon.  It&#x27;s worth every penny, considering I used to pay up to [...] every time I went for a pedicure.  Now, I don&#x27;t go to the beauty salon as often...    Don&#x27;t be scared by how this device looks - it&#x27;s like bon ami, hasn&#x27;t scratched yet!</li>
    <li> I ordered the PedEgg from Amazon and loved it. It took all the dead, dry skin off the soles of my feet with the first treatment. I recently bought the new PedEgg with Handle which I now prefer, as I don&#x27;t have to lean and bend so much to treat my feet. For people who complained about a lack of results, remember that you need to soak your feet first to soften the skin a little. I bought Earth Therapeutics line of foot care products with Tea Tree Oil and my feet are smooth and silky. Give your feet a soak, then use the PedEgg, then apply lotion to moisturize for the best results. I bought Earth Therapeutics Foot Salts Soak, Foot Scrub, Foot Repair Lotion and Tea Tree Oil Spray. Heaven! If you want less bending and reaching while you file your feet, check a local drug store or bath store for the PedEgg with Handle for 12.99 retail.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  I had thick callouses on my heels that not even the manicurist wanted to tackle on a recent trip for a pedicure.  I bought this product and used on dry feet.  I could not believe how this worked.  It makes a fine dust out of the callous.  It&#x27;s been a few days since I used it and I have the baby soft feet I haven&#x27;t seen in years.  My husband used to tell me I scratched him with my feet and also it got caught on the comforter.  No more. [...].</li>
    <li> I had been thinking about getting the PediEgg Professional for some time and received one yesterday.  First of all, I would recommend that you use this only on moisture-free skin to be effective. The included instructions are very easy to understand and the product is very easy to use if you have full use of your hand because you need to wrap your fingers around the hard plastic and move the tool back and forth on the dry skin.  For me, the only difficulty is holding the egg under my foot so the exfoliated skin can be collected in the compartment, as my natural tendency is to place one leg over the other with the foot facing up and use the egg on top of that foot.  In that case, the skin will fall out and onto the ground.  If you have a willing party assist you by using the egg underneath your foot, I imagine it would be fantastic and you&#x27;d have no skin falling out of the compartment.  My heels had become very calloused, so I didn&#x27;t expect too much on the first attempt, but I was very impressed with the results.  The emery pad has an adhesive backing, so it&#x27;s attached to the flat bottom of the egg, the secondary part that protects the blades.  This is a bonus in my opinion because it keeps all I need in one handy device, but I doubt that I&#x27;d spend the money for replacement pads and likely will purchase a separate device that would be longer lasting.  It definitely polished the skin well.  Follow up your treatment with a wonderful foot cream like one by Barielle or simply apply Aquaphor or Vaseline and wear light cotton socks to bed for the final step in softening your dry feet.  Although I&#x27;m impressed with the PediEgg, I&#x27;ve deducted one star because the light plastic of the egg doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough to last for years.  When this one goes, I will get another updated model because it does really work on those nasty dry heels.</li>
    <li> I have (had) really, really badly cracked and callused heels.  These took the real bad spots off with no pain at all and in just a few minutes.  I still need to do some moisturizing and stuff - but my feet are about 80 or 90 percent better after only spending ten dollars and a few minutes.  I used it 2 days ago and there haven&#x27;t been any surprises (one person mentioned pain a day or two after, I didn&#x27;t have that experience).  I did, however, use some restraint on the first use - I didn&#x27;t try to get off that very last little bit of hardness without first waiting a little while and doing some moisturizing.  Anyway, for ten dollars, I don&#x27;t think you could find anything better.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review on any products before, but I feel I really need to express my opinion on this product.  No one has worse calluses than me.  I have tried anything and everything and nothing seems to get rid of them.  The calluses on my heels are thick, ragged and snag on everything including my new silky bedspread I just bought!  If I use pumice stones or a foot file, my calluses are only slightly smoothed over on the top, but the real problem remains underneath.  Well, enter the Ped Egg!  When I use the Ped Egg, it completely and painlessly removes my calluses!  In just one session, I can go from thick ugly calluses to smooth pink heels.  It&#x27;s a wonder product for me.  I feel like I can finally show off my feet without embarrassment.  As long as you use the product the right way, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  (And it would be difficult to use it incorrectly)  When my calluses are really thick, I do have to apply a bit of pressure to get through them, but in the end I&#x27;m left with silky smooth heels!&lt;br /&gt;If you have ugly thick calluses like me, the Ped Egg is the product to buy!  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it!  It&#x27;s a clean way for him to get those calluses off.  Highly recommend for the price!  Nice little thought gift for your significant other.</li>
    <li> took care of the stubborn areas on my feet that after years or trying files, buffers, stones and even professionals couldn&#x27;t seem to get rid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some reviewers complained about the &amp;#34;shavings&amp;#34; ending up on the floor that happens when you hold the egg face down, and to me that is just common sense that that would happen.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t even tried this yet. Soon as I opened the packaging, there was dirt all over the item, it looked like it was used and returned. It looks too gross to try out.</li>
    <li> Maybe I was thinking this would be the best product ever, ever... But it&#x27;s alright. It definitely works but I think I believed the hype of the info-mercials a little too much. Definitely glad I bought it here instead of at a store for way more money. It&#x27;s worth the amazon price. So I&#x27;ll go with a meh, yeah I&#x27;ll use it more than once.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a fake product.  Upon opening it and touching the blade, i can already feel that it has sharp edges and will definitely cut myself.  I thought it weird that such a widely sold product has such sharp blade and so instead, I went to the supermart and bought the real stuff to determine how the blade should feel like.  Immediately I know that this Ped Egg which I bought from Amazon is definitely a FAKE! Don&#x27;t ever buy from this seller especially if you don&#x27;t want to get cut or hurt.  I&#x27;ve thrown it away for safety sake.</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg does exactly what I bought it for, it smooths my heels.  I don&#x27;t know that I would use this long term though.  I&#x27;ve found that it causes my heel calluses to grow back tougher if I use it for more than two or three times in a row.  As a result, I try to use the Ped Egg sparingly, and with a lot of lotion.  Otherwise, I exfoliate a lot instead.    Basically, I only use this once in a while when I&#x27;ve been wearing my sandals a lot, have fallen behind on my heel care, and my heels look really rough and bad.</li>
    <li> No seriously. It&#x27;s exactly what it looks like. A smaller less aggressive cheese grater meant to shave off pieces of your skin. The shavings are pretty fine and amount to what looks like a pile of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that it only catches skin flakes if it&#x27;s being held with the grater side up (makes sense right?). Too bad it&#x27;s not always easy for me to use it that way. You&#x27;ll end up with a pile of skin flakes below you in the &#x27;grating zone&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for calluses! I get quite a few calluses on my hands from weight lifting and the ped egg works well for keeping them trimmed so they don&#x27;t rip off as readily.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000NCTX6C OPI Pedicure Foot File]]This product may work and seemed great at first when you file all that dead skin off of your feet, but days later you&#x27;ll start noticing some more callus growing back on your feet. This is due to that fact that your skins natural way of growing back thicker and harder in order to protect your feet. Some of my clients had obvious signs of grated feet that are flaky and in the shape of the ped egg itself. Same goes for those callus shaver. They are banned in nail salons by law in most states. I would recommend you use a pumice stone or a foot file after shower. The best foot files are made by the salon brand OPI. It is not sold for the public but only in salons and online. Check out the product link. It is rather pricey but definitely worth every penny. Should last for months.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the Ped Egg but am extremely disappointed in it. What a waste of money! I have a number of calluses that become quite thick and painful if I am too busy to keep after them. I occassionally try this product and that in search of the safest, quickest method. This is NOT it! After working and working at a callus with the Ped Egg (quite noisily, I might add - my daughter said it was loud all the way down the hallway to her room!) for quite some time, my calluss was barely changed.    The Spa Corn-X Remover, however, which I have had for some time (and which I hope to find again, or at least the replacement &#x27;working end&#x27;), although a bit dangerous (you would definitely be able to shave too deeply and cut not just slices of calluses, but actual skin away) works so well. I have gone too deep a time or two, but have learned to be careful and become adept. It is amazing how well this works.    The Tweezerman LTD worked well for me, but suddenly (yes, I changed the blade) is not...I seem to have forgotten how to use it as it is not taking anything off... and it is curiously completely lacking in directions, illustrations - strange to have even a single-page of instructions for something using a razor blade. The Tweezerman is slightly &#x27;safer&#x27;than the Spa Corn-X as it seems to control somewhat the &#x27;shaving&#x27; depth.    I have found with both the Spa and Tweezerman (razor blade-type devices) that a controlled sweeping motion works well not unlike a rhythm you can get going when peeling veggies... or if you have ever zested a lemon or orange with a very sharp paring knife. You catch the edge of the callus and use a pulling/sweeping motion. Lifting up as you do helps prevent going too deep. Go extremely shallowly at first until you become practiced and develop a steady and experienced hand.    Good luck finding something that works for you. Ped Egg does not for me. I would give it zero stars if possible.</li>
    <li> got item on time; will purchase again from vendor; will tell my friends about it because price was also wonderful</li>
    <li> It did take off a fair amount of dead skin. Make sure your foot is DRY and put something like a towel down because you are bound to tip it when getting around the heels.  The draw back is that it does not leave your feet soft and smooth.  It has a side spot where you put a stick on piece of file paper/light weight sand paper to smooth after you use the \\&quot;grater\\&quot;. It came with an extra paper for when this one is no longer \\&quot;sanding\\&quot;. I haven&#x27;t seen replacement pads for it anwhere.  My regular plastic handle foot file works just as well or even better since it is easier to hold. This product would be good if you have severely cracked heels but for me, I&#x27;ll just stick to my foot file. And, lotion up well afterwards!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few \\&quot;foot file\\&quot; type products and find that this one is too rough.  The shredder part is so large that it hacks up your feet, while the sanding paper only lasts for a few uses.      I much prefer a finer grate, like what&#x27;s found on the Revlon Callus Remover.  It is gentler, and yet more effective.  Its fine sanding side also lasts a lot longer than the Ped Egg&#x27;s sander.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that lives up to its&#x27; commercials!  Have turned many people onto the PedEgg, and they are all extremely grateful.  Wish I had invented it.  See mega sales on this one!</li>
    <li> This barely works. It left my feet \\&quot;furry\\&quot; and no where near smooth. The shavings are not caught at an appreciative level.  I have never regretted purchasing something so much</li>
    <li> I have been putting up with calloused heels and toes for so many years. I was ashamed of my feet and nothing worked. I even thought about going to a foot doctor for help. I spent loads on pedicures and NEVER did I get results like I did with the ped egg! I purchased mine from Wal Mart for ten dollars and on the first try with it my feet are as smooth as they were when I was a teenager and I am 39 year old now! I feel so much better about myself and I will never have another expensive pedicure again. I went right back to the store and purchased two more for my mother and sister. Not only is this a miracle cure for those nasty calloused feet, but it is also one of the best gifts you can ever give a girl. I had to say something about this product because for once I have found a product that exceeds my expectations! To whoever invented the ped egg.....I wish I could kiss you! You are an angel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with thick calluses and cracking skin on my heels and big toe for a long time. I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, files, and scrubs with little effect for a lot of effort. I was skeptical about the Ped Egg, but I gave it a try and it worked amazingly well for me!     It looks like a little microplane grater for your feet. I like the way it&#x27;s made to cup in your hand while you&#x27;re using it, and that it has a little base/cover to keep the blade safe in a drawer.     With very light pressure moving back and forth, it devoured my calluses in record time. Be sure to use on dry skin as directed, and don&#x27;t try to muscle it too much. I highly recommend lotion and socks after using it to moisturize the newly liberated skin.     It catches most of the shavings, unless you turn it over. I did my feet over the sink so it wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. I don&#x27;t think of a pedicure as an &#x27;anywhere&#x27; task, so I don&#x27;t really see the loose shavings as a problem. If you hold it by the sides and pry the blade part out from the top then it&#x27;s fairly easy to empty. The emery file that sticks to the bottom might be a nice touch, but I don&#x27;t foresee using it. I don&#x27;t know yet how long the blade will be effective, but it has worked so well that I&#x27;ll spring for the replacement blades without a murmur.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my local Walgreens after a girlfriend said she loved hers. My feet are a bit dry, not bad at all, but a bit rough on the heels and balls of my feet, so I thought why not. I tried it out after a bath that night, and while it worked ok, my old foot file (looks like a microplane grater) worked just as well (if not better) for only $1.59 compared to the $10 for the egg...I didn&#x27;t have a problem with mess, I knew to keep the egg upright, and it wasn&#x27;t difficult for me to get the top off to empty it.   Overall, it was not what I&#x27;d call a failed product, but I won&#x27;t be recommending it or buying it as a gift for anyone...</li>
    <li> I love to wear sandles but have zero time to get a pedicure so my feet turn into SOS pads over the summer. I bought the PedEgg hoping it would be the answer to my prayers and so far I guess it&#x27;s probably the closest I&#x27;ll ever get. I love the contour of the product and it fits nicely into my hand. After working on each foot for a probably a total for 8-10 minutes my hand didn&#x27;t feel like it was going to cramp like it did with some of the other pumice stone things I have. I like the premise of something that will &#x27;catch&#x27; all the shavings but in reality I use it at more of a 90 degree angle (otherwise it&#x27;s an unnatural position for my hand) and so at least 25% or more of the shavings continue to fall all over the floor. I guess I should have done the test run on this over the trash can! Something else I wasn&#x27;t too excited about - I couldn&#x27;t get the stupid thing apart to empty out the canister. Had to call in my husband. As for my heels - it really did work nicely. After I figured out the most effective position/angle for the pedegg on whatever part of my foot I was working on, it seemed to be very efficient and not at all painful or uncomfortable. I loved the little emery (sp?) boards that were included as well. They really got the rest of those little pieces that couldn&#x27;t be picked up by the pedegg. So...10 minutes of my night and my feet are like new again. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have nicer tootsies!</li>
    <li> Before this product My wife though I had alligator feet. Now I have the feet of an Adonis.</li>
    <li> When i recieved it in the mail, the filiment was squished in. I had to push out the filliment in order to use it. But after that, it works well and my heels are smooth and crack free.</li>
    <li> I use this about once a week or less, and it works best after a shower where your feet have softened up. Fast remedy to touch feet and works fast.</li>
    <li> Its a great product. The only problem i had with it is that it was meant to keep all the \\&quot;dead skin\\&quot; or whatever you want to call it inside and it doesnt. But a little clean up is worth nice soft feet!</li>
    <li> It really, really works ! I used it after taking a shower and I must tell you my feet have never felt softer or looked better. I&#x27;m thrilled with this product. The best $10 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
    <li> it does work, but i find that if u don&#x27;t hold it a certain way everything u just scrapped come out of the same place of the tool that hold th scrappings. handles well.</li>
    <li> This product definitely does what it sets out to do.  It is super at getting rid of tough skin on the feet.  The first time I used it though, I think I overdid it and it really hurt to walk for a few days.  I couldnt tell at the time that I was sanding too deeply, so now I get a little scared sometimes.  It is nice that the dead skin collects in the bowl part of the product so using the product isnt messy and the bowl disconnects from the grater for easy disposal (and its fun to see all the dead skin you got rid of :) ).  I would highly recomment this product, I just think that you should be careful that you dont over-use it.</li>
    <li> I  bought one and I am very happy with the results.  I have very bad cracked heels and have used pumice stone several times without much success.  One use of ped egg made my feet much smoother - I am sure that with regular use, I can keep the cracked heels under check.  I can&#x27;t afford a pedicure that often. Additionally, I don&#x27;t always have the time and energy to give myself a pumice stone pedicure in the bathroom (it needs wet feet and the droppings) - but I can do a pedegg pedicure even while relaxing in the living room.</li>
    <li> This little egg is a miracle. Try as I might to take care of my heals, come rain or shine, cold and heat, they are a veritable canyon system of cracks. So gross. So embarrassing. So instead of dropping $35 a week and imposing arthritic level effort on the part of my beloved Vietnamese nail tech, Ing, I picked up one of these babies and haven&#x27;t looked back since.&lt;br /&gt;Both Ing and I agree that my heals now look like they belong to a high-maintenance human being as opposed to a road weary hobbit.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing!!! i got it just to try it out cause i was seeing mixed reviews but i love it!!</li>
    <li> I would give it zero star if I could. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ve spent half an hour and didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
    <li> My \\&quot;Ped Egg\\&quot; just came in the mail and i&#x27;m returning it. Completely fake, looks used, and packaging is clearly thrown together. Dirty and unusable.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the quality of the products when I read the mixed reviews about the quality and the fact that some claim they received repackaged used products.  I decided to try it anyway because I really like the product and decide to give them the benefit of the doubt.  When I received the replacement files, they were obviously used and of poor quality. I didnt even need to open them to see that.  It appears they took used products and just repackaged them for resell.  I&#x27;m not sure why Amazon allows this kind of vendor to sell on their site. What a waste of time. Only saving grace is that Amazon provides all expense paid returns. AVOID THESE REPLACEMENTS!</li>
    <li> This thing is USELESS at best.. I hate it! It not only doesn&#x27;t make my feet soft - it makes it ROUGH! It has these little flimsy blades that don&#x27;t cut evenly (the little they do cut) so if you brush your feet against your sheets after using this product, you will hear/feel as if you scraped your nails on a chalkboard. BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> This is working tremendously well.  After trying numerous creams and other items, the Ped-egg is the answer for me.  It is easy and convenient to work.</li>
    <li> It did exactly what it said. It got rid of any roughness on my feet quickly. Very easy to use and it catches the filings so you don&#x27;t make a mess. I did not have any problems with roughness as some of the other reviewers did. I found that it left my feet perfectly smooth. Simply use as instructed. I finish off with a foot moisturizer for good measure. It kept my feet looking great all summer!</li>
    <li> Pedegg wrecked my and my husband&#x27;s feet.  We were so happy the first day we tried it.  We saw the shavings come off and our feet get smoother.  Then it all went bad.  Maybe we overdid it, but parts of our feet got delicate and red.  Months later, our feet are rougher than they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this and absolutly love it!  It is not as scary as it looks (cheese graterish) and is only for callused feet.  However, my mom (who has the same callus-prone feet I do) doesn&#x27;t like it... I&#x27;m very surprised.  I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am so amazed with my ped egg.  I really was skeptical on whether or not it would work.  I must say I am overly pleased.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better way to get the dry skin off my feet.  I noticed the great results after the first use.  I actually came on here to read the reviews before purchasing, and saw that everyone loved it...I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Yes, as others have mentioned this is a cheese grater for your feet. But did that really surprise you. What else can it be? It does a pretty good job of getting the dead skin and/or callouses off your feet. It will not however in my case get my feet as smooth as a babies behind. This item is not recommended for diabetics, which I am and have had no problems with it causing any cuts, scrapes for injuries. But you need to pay attention to what your doing.</li>
    <li> I rated it one because I made a mental list of its cons and then tried to think of its pros and couldn&#x27;t come up with any. The skin shaving mostly stayed in it although some fell out, not really a big deal, I groom in the bathroom and expected at least a little mess. My feet are mostly rough from wearing flip flops too much and though they are much rougher than they used to be, I see other ladies&#x27; feet and can tell you that they are still pretty decent in comparison. My thing was that even though I didn&#x27;t use very much pressure and I followed the instructions dilligently my feet were terribly sore and none the softer. That&#x27;s unacceptable. I&#x27;m willing to take some discomfort in exchange for results but there were none. Just painful, kind of like you&#x27;ve been wearing awful shoes all day long while running around. Took a couple of weeks to get back to normal. NOTE: I&#x27;ve been reading some reviews on Dremels and from there I got the idea, because other people have been doing it, to use it to soften my feet. It worked great. I used the Dremel 400 but I just got the Dremel Minimite because it&#x27;s cordless and more convenient for grooming and because my husband wanted the big Dremel back in the garage.</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg delivers as promised... It does however, take awhile to &#x27;shave&#x27; down feet that are in bad shape. I wish they would make an electric Ped Egg like an electric fuzz remover...</li>
    <li> love it. only problem... would like it to be a little stronger.</li>
    <li> one waste of time and money&lt;br /&gt;not the same you see on TV&lt;br /&gt;the truth I do not advise buying this product</li>
    <li> It removes dead skin, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it.  That&#x27;s exactly what I bought it for so five stars.</li>
    <li> The item I received is not an authentic PedEgg, although it is advertised as such and even came in what looked like authentic packaging. I have had probably 20 real PedEggs that I have purchased from retail stores and there is at least 10 things wrong with the knock off I received that SCREAM knock off. The metal file surface is curved out (very dangerous, you could cut yourself very deeply!) the top doesn&#x27;t fit in the bottom, the black finishing pads look different, there were black grease marks (or something!) all over it, the inside of the bottom piece doesn&#x27;t have the patent info on it (the real ones do), the pieces do not fit together properly.....I could go on and on. Anyway, STAY AWAY from this product. This is bad false advertisement, is NOT authentic and should not be listed and packaged as such! This is going in the trash and I already got my refund.</li>
    <li> Actually it&#x27;s a very good product.  Only thing I wasn&#x27;t happy with was since I got it for my husband and I had to go with the &amp;#34;colors may vary&amp;#34; option wouldn&#x27;t you know it arrived in white with tiny pink polka dots all over it.  Oh well----still does what it&#x27;s supposed to do,</li>
    <li> Perhaps the older ones worked okay, but I&#x27;ve been scraping for probably months and months to no avail.  I recommend just going with a different scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should&#x27;ve researched other scrapers and trusted the online consensus before purchasing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the negative reviews, because I had owed this product before and been happy with it, but the bad reviews are right! I bought one of these a while back and loved it. The one I received this time is a MUCH lower quality version of what I used to have, though. The plastic looks cheap and is challenging to separate and put back together. The grate part of the device is MUCH rougher and really does feel like a cheese grater on my foot, The old ped egg never caused me pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also just doesn&#x27;t work, so I guess I&#x27;m in the market for a new product. I&#x27;m so sad about wasting my money ....and I&#x27;ll  be even more sad if you waste yours.</li>
    <li> I have been meaning to buy a ped egg for years. I finally did and am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> this is really amazing product .love it so much.skin is like a baby.i will buy it again and agein:) thank  you very much</li>
    <li> The fit quality was somewhat lacking. Mind won&#x27;t stay together.  The scraping blades are a little bit coarse. If the quality were improved I would give it 1.5 stars more.</li>
    <li> I must say this is the best product I tried to get rid of the dried up skin that I have been getting for the past few years. My advice is for you to take it slow and soften your feet over months, not just in one sessions. Give your feet time to heal before you remove too much skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on August 6th, received on August 20th. I was not aware this item was being shipped from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did receive the original ped-Egg in the rigid plastic display container, I also received a second unit packaged in a cheap, paper box, labled Ped-Egg but was an obvious knock-off. The second unit compoents were cheaper and the stamped logo onthe product cover was in lighter blue ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orginal Ped Egg is a good product and works as intended. The knock-off could be actually hazardous to use.</li>
    <li> my feet are horable i  use this after getting out of the shower and sometimes when they are dry also they r prefect now  its so amazing  everyone needs one</li>
    <li> This is an amazing and simple product.  It literally grates the hard calloused skin right off your feet.  I went a bit crazy with the first use and got great results but now five days later my heels are still sore.  I suggest doing it slowly over a few days, maybe even tossing in a day off in between.  You will still have perfect feet in a week.  GREAT product.  I finish up with Miracle Foot Repair an a pair of cotton socks for as long as I can keep them on.Go ahead and buy the grate replacements because you will want them. This little product is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I have a manicure license. Went to school, learned how to properly manicure and pedicure. This thing is better then the $25 or so that you spend on a pedicure. Short of shaping your toenails and painting them, it is your pedicurist. I&#x27;m a barefooter, so I have heavily dry calloused feet. I Pedi-egg my feet like twice a week and my feet feel like they get dipped in wax or something. This thing is a miracle. Worth every penny. No Batteries necessary? BUY IT.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:22267291]]ASOTVI review of the Ped Egg, pedicure foot file.  For a complete write up go to [...]</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me. The blades are not sharp. It&#x27;s not worth returning the product due to the postage fees that I&#x27;ll incur. I&#x27;d give this zero stars if I can.</li>
    <li> This is not at all what I thought it would be.  This was a true waste of my money and in these economic hard times that just makes me mad!</li>
    <li> I received a generic version of this product. Not the real thing. It came in a flimsy and cheap cardboard box. The seller was not Amazon as they didn&#x27;t have it available, but eligible for Prime shipping. I ended up throwing this out and buying one at my local pharmacy. Buying it at the pharmacy was the same price - $10. It came in hard plastic case and didn&#x27;t have serrated plastic edges like the one I received.</li>
    <li> i contacted the company i got it from and they just did what they do to all orers from amazon - sent it so i dont blame them for this i blame amazon!  For starters there was no pastage adertised untill you get to the final buying page!  when i saw that postage was x9! of the item price i clicked the red cross to close down the page what numbskull would pay $90p/h for a $10 item? not me!!!  but the transaction went through anyway - there goes most of my chrissy prezzie cash!   thanx alot! (sarcastic) amazon didnt even reply to my polite questions of what happend.    not happy jan!</li>
    <li> I bought the PedEgg in June for my husband&#x27;s rough cracked feet.  He was literally cutting me up with them! He always told me a real man had rough feet - needless to say, I felt otherwise.   He now enjoys using the PedEgg regularly and I enjoy his smooth feet. I attempted to use it once, but it was a too much for my feet.     Pros: Small and sanitary - doesn&#x27;t leave a mess        Low cost  Cons: Blade got dull after about 4 months - This is a nothing too major considering the wear that was put on it. Plus the replacements from [...] only costs $[...].</li>
    <li> This foot scraper is a nice concept, but it really is more gimmicky than actually innovative.  Sure, it scrapes your feet and shears off the dead skin, but in my experience, more &#x27;shavings&#x27; ended up on the floor and not in the &#x27;egg&#x27; recepticle.  When the price goes down to about four or five bucks, it would not be a bad skin care item to have.  But at i0 bucks or more, it&#x27;s a waste of money.  You&#x27;d do better just to buy a one buck pumice stone at your local dollar stone and use it while showering.    So, in all, great concept that kind of falls short of its promises.</li>
    <li> I have been fighting what my Dermatologist has diagnosed as Foot Psoriasis for the past two years.  The weired thing is that it&#x27;s just at the bottom of my feet.  I&#x27;ve had many bouts with thickening and cracking skin to the point where the fissures would bleed and hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I have discovered that a mega dose of Vitamin D3, Biotin and Fish Oil seems to help to keep it in check.  Along with moisturizing my feet with medication and the different types of salves that the doctor prescribed.  But inspite of all that, I still get the thickening of the skin and the eventual cracking though not as bad as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different types of emery boards and something similar to a rasp file intended to scrape off the dead skin but haven&#x27;t had much sucess with any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In desperation, I started using a Gillete Mach 3 razor which seems to work but more often than not, I take off too much skin to the point where it becomes red and sometimes bleed.  NOT A GOOD THING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must laugh at the thought of using an ELECTRIC SANDER as some people have done (ROFLOL!), But in desperation, I would have tried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife just gave me one of her Ped-Eggs (AFTER she caught me shaving the bottom of my feet!) and I can immediately see the difference and the ease of using it.  All I can say is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;, maybe now the bottom of my feet will heal sufficently that I can go back to the beach and not worry about the Salt hurting my open sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped Kayaking, Swimming and Snorkeling because the SALT water DOES sting when it hits the open wounds.  But now I am encouraged that I can keep the bottom of my feet smooth, free of cracks and open sores from the callouse build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the point on living in PARADISE (HAWAII) if one cannot take advantage of all that it has to offer:  i.e. Swimming, Kayaking, Surfboarding, Snorkeling ...etc. ???</li>
    <li> Love it! It works great and it is so much cheaper then a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I usually do not buy anything advertised on TV because of false promotion and results.  So I carefully read the reviews here and since The Egg was given 4 stars, I trusted the results.     I had a $2 off coupon at Walgreens so that sealed the deal on the $9.99 purchase.  I had been for over a year trying - without success - to remove a callus on the outside of each of my big toes.  Every night FAITHFULLY, I would use a pumice stone, foot file, creams, and lotions without success. The darn callus would not go away.    Yes, the Egg is like a grater. I guess that is what I needed to remove the stubborn skin of the callus.  I have used it for only a week and the calluses are completely gone!  I did not use it every day, so as not to take off too much all at once. It&#x27;s very gentle and easy to judge how much you want to scrape.    I use a cream afterward to seal in moisture after the scraping, which is highly recommended.   The unit is easy to clean and will be a  permanent fixture in my nightstand next to my bed.  Incredible and amazing product for calluses!      Thanks to all the Amazon customers for their feedback.  I  never buy anything - and I mean anything - without checking here first!  What a great review website!</li>
    <li> This was very cheaply manufactured and really did not work very well.  The blades barely scratched off the dead skin unless I used it for hours, which would just become painful and annoying after awhile.  Once I bought one of the razors specifically designed for thick callouses, I realized how crappy this product actually is.  Don&#x27;t buy it if you actually need your callouses removed!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this was an add-on item so no point in returning it. However, this seller shipped me a rusty ped-egg like it was water damaged!! The aluminum was also very thin. I&#x27;ve purchased ped eggs from the store before and I loved them so if your feet need some loving get one -- however, AVOID TELEbrands. Never again.</li>
    <li> Broke within a few weeks. Not worth the money or the time. I was totally disappointed with this product. But, you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> I had never had problems with dry skin on my feet but all of a sudden i was peeling to the point where it was painful.  This Ped Egg is a inexpensive solution and works like a dream.  I used it for about 15 minutes and shaved down some of the spots and now my feet are back to normal.  Would recommend this over many other more expensive options!</li>
    <li> Love! I&#x27;ve used the ped egg for years and nothing, not even a salon pedicure gets my heals smoother and removes dead skin like the ped egg does.</li>
    <li> Way better than a traditional zester because it captures all of what you want in the compartment.  Just don&#x27;t use it on your feet or your guests may get some additional flavor!</li>
    <li> I have a whole bowl full of delicious foot shavings because of this wonderful device. A++ will use again and again.</li>
    <li> This product definitely does the job.  Great price to have smooth feet and definitely good quality.  I rated down one star just because i didn&#x27;t find the packaging very attractive but once opened it was the greats product that I had ordered.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  It&#x27;s cheap in price and nothing special but it really does the job.  Use on heels and sides with absolutely no pain.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Didn&#x27;t rip, or cut my feet. Trouble is, with my heels, I wish the Ped Egg had a motor attached to it!  No motorized Ped Eggs yet, but a girl can dream...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brooke W.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good but the top doesn&#x27;t stay on and the stuff inside falls out. Not happy, but I cant return it, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
    <li> I like this product to give myself at home pedicures. It works well to get rid of the rough spots on the bottoms and sides of my feet. I would recommend this product to anyone who does at home pedicures</li>
    <li> Foot &#x27;scrubbings&#x27; go all over the place, not in the &#x27;egg&#x27;, which makes this a disgusting process. Every time my fiance uses it I have to vacuum! Plus, if you have dry feet and even accidentally rub it on the dry spots they&#x27;ll crack and bleed. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased a PedEgg from my local Sears a couple of years ago. I really like it and since it gets a lot of use, I decided to buy another. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think the product I received is authentic. I immediately noticed that the blade had a large black greasy spot on top and black stuff underneath. Yuck. The top and bottom didn&#x27;t fit together well.  Also, the print on the top of the egg doesn&#x27;t match the old product.  Worst of all, the blade is made of shiny cheap looking thick metal with jaggedly raised edges that look like they will tear skin.  In comparison, the blade on my old PedEgg looks like matte aluminum and the raised bits that do the shaving are thin, sharp, even, and smooth. I really think this is a counterfeit product and returned it. I&#x27;ll have to go back to Sears.</li>
    <li> this item is very bad..it is not original one .it&#x27;s a illegal copy. don&#x27;t work. call the  sealer doesn&#x27;t  take response. buy the law sealer have to stop sale this item.</li>
    <li> I remember when these first came out and they were perfect. They removed every callus. Now however, the product is made with cheaper and less effective metal. It&#x27;s nothing more than a glorified cheese grater that doesn&#x27;t remove the rough spots.</li>
    <li> product does a good job with grating off old skin.  Just be careful not to pull off skin tags and to put too much pressure.  My feet look young again.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. It works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it for some time now.</li>
    <li> Really does the job.  That being said, it is a little messy.  I haven&#x27;t found any way to hold the thing at the various angles required to reach all parts of my heel without a bunch of the skin in the collection cup pouring out.  However, it does such a good job smoothing up my feet that I am willing to overlook that problem.  I usually use the thing over a towel and then shake the towel outside when I&#x27;m done or just whip out the vacuum.</li>
    <li> You see this on TV as something that is going to make you feet soft and beautiful. Contrary to that, it tore the skin of my feet! The skin on my feet is now peeling and flaking off. I can&#x27;t stand to have my feet touch anything, and onto of that the callouses just grew back thicker and now they hurt. Please do not buy this product. I used it just how it says it should be used and now my feet are screwed up thanks to this piece of crap!</li>
    <li> This works better than anything else I have tried.  The only problem I had with it is that it doesn&#x27;t always hold in all the shavings.  Some of the dust comes out of the cracks.  I&#x27;m still glad I purchased it.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The blades cut way too deep.  I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and am very careful when using this product but don&#x27;t recommend it.  A similar product I found at the dollar store works much better ($1).  The blades are much finer and it&#x27;s almost impossible to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of walking and standing on my feet. This is a really nice and compact way to take care of myself when I don&#x27;t have time to get a pedicure. I still have the same one I bought and it&#x27;s been a few years now. I keep it clean by washing with warm water and letting it air dry. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I bought my ped egg power at a store. I put in the batteries and nothing. I put the batteries in the device every way possible, still nothing. I exchanged it, just in case that first one was defective. Same exact thing with this one. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> When my doctor recommended the Ped Egg I checked out the reviews, which were very mixed. The one I ordered came on time, the blade was brand new and while it doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the CVS version I also tried, it works just fine. They do say, &amp;#34;Colors May Vary,&amp;#34; and I got one with a funky black and white pattern I could do without.</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a real customer who just bought one of these for the first time and WOW! If I wasn&#x27;t so embarrassed by how my heels looked before I would have taken a before and after picture. I wear ballet flats every day of the week. My heels were extreme calloused w/ deep cracks. I&#x27;ve tried soaking my feet, using pommel stones and similar products and nothing really worked. Within 30 minutes of using this product on both my heels, they looked as though I&#x27;d never had a callous at all. This is going to sound gross, but the Ped Egg is sort of like a very gentle cheese grater. Lol I used it while my feet were dry (no lotion, no soaking) and it gently sloughed/ worked off the callous.  This is an amazing product! Thank you so much. It&#x27;s so nice to not be embarrassed anymore!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man with a callous problem on the ball of one foot.  The callous builds up and gets so thick that it becomes painful if I happen to put a lot of weight on that part of that foot.  Rather than continue to see the podiatrist so he can shave off the excess, I thought I would try this.  It worked well the first couple of times but quickly lost its edge (sharpness) and essentially became useless.  There are better callous shaving devices out there - this is not one of them.</li>
    <li> It works, but it takes forever to rub dry skin off and it leaves a mess. You need to keep a vacuum and hose next to you after you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> I have another one of these that I bought from WalMart, but with a long handle attached, so I figured I&#x27;d buy another without the handle.  Well, this one looks scary.  The metal surface where the blades are etched is all warped and not flat.  I still use it a bit but I should probably just toss it... looks like either a big manufacturing defect or knock-off product</li>
    <li> Have had the \\&quot;original\\&quot; ped egg for years.  This is a much cheaper version and while it might have been useful for spare parts the quality of the emery board and the metal file are laughable and it doesn&#x27;t really retrofit the original.  Blast that dog for chewing my first one up.......</li>
    <li> This product is worthless - not even close to a real Ped Egg. The real Ped Egg actually works. You might as well use an emery board on your feet. What a waste of my money! It seems Amazon is so busy trying to build it&#x27;s business, it doesn&#x27;t really look at the products being sent to its customers. This is the second knock-off product I&#x27;ve unknowingly purchased, which is fine as long as it is labeled as such. I&#x27;ll stick to books only from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have very tough calluses and the egg barely removed any of it, it was a waste of time.  Guess it&#x27;s only for tender feet.</li>
    <li> I have always had dry heels. And I have tried every foot file they put on the market. See I&#x27;m a dabetic Type 2 and you really have to take real good care of your feet. My feet would get so dry,scaly, that even I would put every kind of cream,lotion. My feet would still crack and sometimes bleed it would be very painfull to stand up or wear shoes. I have tried the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s handle foot file but alot of times I could not get everywhere or it was hard to use. I also tried the stone foot file and that was a waste. So I seen this on T.V. but I thought yea other thing that won&#x27;t work, but then I look it up on Amazon and read the reviews and I bought it right then. I&#x27;m so glad. I got my order quick. And a great price. But the most important thing is that this really really works. My feet had already dry skin all around my heel and I used this for about 10 minutes or so and I could not believe that I saw new skin. And very easy to use. I was so happy and proud how good they felt and looked that, Now I will buy sandals again. And I won&#x27;t be embarrass anymore. And it is easy to keep clean. Also this was cheaper than the one I had and hated using it. I tell you this little ped egg is a winner. I know you will like it. And say bye to scaly dry feet.</li>
    <li> I cant remember where i heard it doesn&#x27;t work but I know what I heard. I am really mad that I didnt get this earlier. There is no substitute for this little wonder. It absolutely works!! I susally dont like to just listen to what others say. but sadly I did on this product and postponed buying it for some time. It really smoothes the skin and I suggest you use it gradually as our feet have some build up for protection especially if you carry extra weight. So do a ifew scraping over a few days and , see how your feet are. Do not over do it. This little thing really removes layers and it feels so great doing it hence how you can get carried away. I hope I have helped. So definitely get this it can be used for everyone. I even used it lightly on my 4 yr old for the skin on his feet that looks dirty from walking barefoot. Its a great little gem. I got mine from ebay 2 for 8$ very well worth it!</li>
    <li> JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I LOVE THE PED EGG, IT REALLY WORKS.    THANKS  AWR</li>
    <li> Totally loved this product and i am 100% satisfied...I live in Saudi Arabia and it costs me more than the original price cause of shipping fees but i could say with clear words that i loved this product and i would recommend it for all my friends even buy them this product as a gift in the future</li>
    <li> The Ped Egg Foot file seems to do the job -- without harming our feet.  It is a slow process,though; and the shavings are a little tricky to manage.  We think that you should have some sort of \\&quot;drop cloth\\&quot; beneath where you are using a Ped Egg.  If you don&#x27;t, then lots of shavings are going on the floor!  not sure that we would buy this thing again.    Dennis</li>
    <li> Good for your heels. Hope there are variation/extension of this product. Blade needs to be replaced to keep it effective.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it all. It doesn&#x27;t remove dead skin or calluses, and when I press harder it hurts. Maybe, it is different for each person.</li>
    <li> Really cheap. IT works okay, but not enough to get dry skin off. I don&#x27;t have terribly bad feet and it didn&#x27;t work on me. Not to mention on drop of it and it will be broken. Not buying it again.</li>
    <li> I should have read the previous reviews. I thought that since I was buying it from Amazon, it was okay. This Ped Egg is not a genuine Ped Egg. I&#x27;ve bought 2 Ped Eggs in the past. This one is inferior all around. From the cheap packaging to the super cheap plastic that doesn&#x27;t fit together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I saved a little by buying online. But for a few more bucks, I can buy it in the store. What a very weird thing to make a knockoff. I can understand having to be suspicious of designer purses online. But, a $9.99 Peg Egg being knocked off. It&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a hassle too! I have to print out a label, find a box for it, and the find a stupid UPS drop off. All of this hassle for a little over $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I&#x27;ve ordered a lot from Amazon. I haven&#x27;t even tried the stores. If Amazon has it, I just order it. Because of getting a fake item and now having the hassle of returning a FAKE item, I will go back to going to the store where I get genuine goods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Amazon should take some ownership here and not sell fake goods. I should be able to trust that items I purchase from Amazon are genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Amazon gave me a full refund with no hassle.</li>
    <li> A cheap knock-off being passed as the real thing.  Packaging wasn&#x27;t even sealed well where they took the real thing out and put a fake in it&#x27;s place.  The blades aren&#x27;t sharp and don&#x27;t work.  The \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; isn&#x27;t rough enough to do it&#x27;s job either.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I have used the Ped Egg for years, and I actually really like the product.  It works, although you do have to be careful not to grate too much.  However, after several years of buying the Ped Egg I have realized that one out of the 3 graters in the package does not work.  I have now tested many packages and without fail, one of the 3 graters is totally dull,.  If you have used the Ped Egg you know that the graters are very effective, and it is quite noticeable when it is dull. The first couple of times this happened I thought it was a coincidence--but I have now tested at least 10 packages and every single one has a dull grater in it.  This seems to be a deliberate dishonest marketing tool to get the consumer to buy another package early.  I love the Ped Egg, and would give it 5 starts if not for this.</li>
    <li> The ped egg is simply amazing. I wish I would have purchased one of these years ago. I&#x27;ve worked in restaurants for over nine years which means that I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on my feet building up some pretty gnarly callouses. Also I wear flip flops every day pretty much so my feet are always out in the open. I really don&#x27;t like socks so my feet had gotten really think \\&quot;hooves\\&quot; as a friend called them. They were pretty embarrassing actually and every time I was out in public wearing my flip flops I would always try to hide my feet. The way I made do without the Ped Egg before was that after a shower and my feet had a time to soak I would take a knife and scrape off as much of the callous as I could... ya... not the smartest thing in the world. What finally convinced me to try this out was purchasing some satin sheets. My feet felt like velcro and would stick to my sheets and even though they were awesome and smooth and I loved them my feet made them almost unusable.    Now that I have a Ped Egg everything about that has changed. My feet are smoother and more supple than they have been since I can remember. I honestly didn&#x27;t believe anything short of a miracle could fix my feet. I&#x27;d looked into various creams and lotions and anything I could and nothing really seemed to fit what I needed it to do. But, the Ped Egg did everything I could have dreamed it to do. I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased this product. I wish I could rate it 10 stars.    Like other posters have said do be careful with it and if you have really thick callouses take them down in intervals. You&#x27;ll definately be able to tell if you took too much off at once as that spot is a little more sensitive. Callouses are meant to protect our feet after all. I was afraid that using this I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell when to stop but it&#x27;s honestly easy to tell when you&#x27;re taking off dead dry skin and when it&#x27;s done.    The only con to this product which isn&#x27;t really a con so much are the emery pads that come with it. Ireally like how they work and think they&#x27;re good but they honestly only work for one or two uses for me and then they don&#x27;t work as well anymore. They&#x27;re definitely needed though. Even using the Ped Egg to get rid of the callous still leaves rough edges. It&#x27;s the equivalent to using 200 grit sand paper on wood. It works great to take off all the burrs and what not but after you&#x27;re done you really need a finer grit to finish the job and make it silky smooth.    Long story short: I love this product and have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> The item sent was not a Ped Egg. I received a blissful feet pod made by Personnel Touch TV Brands. It is not the same as the picture. This thing is round and not shaped like an egg as the picture shows. A very cheap Chinese copy. Sending it back for a refund. Link to picture of what I received :   [...]</li>
    <li> I ordered this \\&quot;Ped Egg\\&quot; through Amazon last week.  I have had a Ped Egg for a quite while now, and I noticed that the blades were becoming dull from my (excessive) use, so I ordered this one to replace it.  What I received, however, was not an authentic Ped Egg.  No where on the front of the package does is say Ped Egg (which is very prominently displayed in the photo used by this seller) and the Ped Egg logo is missing from the actual product (please see differences in this photo: [...]).  Before even opening it, I contacted Amazon to let them know that I had received a product that was not as ordered (Amazon has the best customer service!).  After speaking with the agent, I went ahead and opened up the product to see how it would perform, despite not being a legitimate Ped Egg.  The file part does not securely attach to the bottom portion of the egg (doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;snap\\&quot; into place).  I held it in place the best I could, and tried to use the product.  Instead of the gentle buffing of an authentic Ped Egg, this feels equivalent to taking a cheese grater to your foot - a ripping, grating, potentially blood-drawing experience.  I did receive a refund from Amazon, but please save yourself the  time and do not buy this fake, knock-off Ped Egg; go to any drug store and purchase an authentic Ped Egg.    Something should be done about this seller marketing their products as something they clearly are not.</li>
    <li> It surprised me, but I do like this foot file.  After trying many many other, this is the only one left in my bathroom that has not been thrown away because it broke or stopped working.</li>
    <li> It worked a little better than the files I got at the store, but it was very uncomfortable to hold, and it took a lot of strength and time to file my feet. The only good thing is the container that holds the dead skin. It was a waste of money. I then got a microplane here on Amazon, and it works really well. Get a microplane instead of a ped egg.</li>
    <li> I would rate it higher, but the replacement pads don&#x27;t work with it, there&#x27;s a slight difference in the sizing.  So this amount of money for a disposable item isn&#x27;t acceptable to me.  I would have returned it but I didn&#x27;t find this out until after I got the replacement scrubbers.</li>
    <li> Cheap blades. Possible knock-off</li>
    <li> I already have a ped egg that I bought at BB and Beyond and it seems that this one was cheaply made. The shell seems thinner and the blade not as sharp.</li>
    <li> I got a Revlon one at Walmart, and my mom liked it, so she wanted one. I thought this one would be better since it was the one on TV, bit my mom said it is much duller than the other one.</li>
    <li> Blissful Feet pod is NOT a Ped Egg...it&#x27;s a knock off that doesn&#x27;t work...i do not recomend buying from this seller...and they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to say it&#x27;s a ped egg when it&#x27;s not...</li>
    <li> Arrived 5 days late. Works very well compared to a regular foot file. Connection between the metal file and the plastic seems a bit loose so the skin \\&quot;dust\\&quot; is a little messy. But my feet are already much smoother! Worth the money :)</li>
    <li> I have very dry cracked heels all year round and it only took a few minutes of ped egg treatment on each foot to smooth them out. So easy and no mess!</li>
    <li> It definitely works well.. After first usage itself I could get rid of all the dead skin on my feet... It needs to be used on dry skin only.. I have always had problem of tough skin on my feet.. and now am so relieved and its all because of ped egg</li>
    <li> This terrible product gave me embarrassing calluses on my heel, where I previously had smooth normal skin!!! This is the worst thing that has ever touched my feet!!! It does MORE HARM THAN GOOD!!</li>
    <li> This scraped the evan little crap out of my foot and i went to the hospital for it! stupid ped eggggggg!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about being this being an off brand, but I just used my Ped Egg and it didn&#x27;t do much. My feet are average (not covered in callouses, but has dry, peely spots). After 10 minutes of using this product I didn&#x27;t see much change. I&#x27;m disappointed but not surprised.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize just how sharp these foot files are, use with extreme caution!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 20-something who spent all of her high school and college years:&lt;br /&gt;A) Lifeguarding with feet to cement for long periods of time&lt;br /&gt;B) Strolling around barefoot occasionally during the summers&lt;br /&gt;C) Wearing high heels and other bad shoes that rubbed&lt;br /&gt;D) All of the above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is D, and despite getting pedis, using a pumice stone, etc., nothing made my feet look or feel pretty. I thought it was just something I had to deal with--the damage was done. But then I tried the Ped Egg. I cannot rave enough about this thing. My feet look like they should be in a nail polish commercial! I wish I would have taken a before and after pictures because it&#x27;s seriously insane. My boyfriend was impressed, too.  He even tried it out after looking at my feet. They look SO good. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One piece of advice--you will get flakes of loose dead skin the Ped Egg takes off on your feet and it looks like you have more left than you do. I would advise stopping after a while to rinse your feet off and moisturize. You&#x27;ll find that most of what you saw is already loose, and if you would have kept going, your skin could have become irritated or raw. I like finishing it off with the buffer and some cucumber melon lotion--perfection! Oh, and as always, Amazon is wonderful to work with as far as shipping cost/time/etc. No complaints on that end, either.</li>
    <li> I actually love the results of this product! I rate it low because the manufacture has constantly changed the standard of production. You never know what you&#x27;re going to get when you order replacement blades. The blade comes mounted to a plastic insert that snaps into place. If the insert is too small then it constantly falls out. (Very annoying)&lt;br /&gt;For me this would be like buying a razor and then having the replacement blade fall off every time you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Ped Egg to replace one I could no longer get blades for. Then I ordered a package of replacement blades so I wouldn&#x27;t have the same problem. The replacement blades didn&#x27;t fit either of the Ped Eggs I have.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a process I will repeat! It&#x27;s a shame because I liked the product but I will find an alternative.</li>
    <li> Okay I saw this on TV and thought great another save your life product I can put it with my pocket fisherman ........... However I ordered it and the dang thing works great and the shipping and handling was first class , will do business with these people again .</li>
    <li> I am aware of the counterfeit Ped Egg, but my order was supposed to be fulfilled by Amazon. Instead, the package was shipped directly from the vendor. The package looks nothing like the original Ped Egg (hard plastic wrap). It came in a flimsy paper box about the size of the Ped Egg itself with two emery pads (not even wrapped). No instruction/warning. No additinal sales ads. The item looks dull and dirty as if it was made from molten recycle plastic.</li>
    <li> This product is o.k., but it takes so long to remove the dead skin.</li>
    <li> this is great to remove that dired up skin on your feet.easy to use and will not make cuts on your feet.</li>
    <li> it worked fine but woreout too fast.</li>
    <li> Works well for me to keep my feet soft.  I had one before which was no longer as sharp as before, so I bought this as a replacement.</li>
    <li> nothing like the real ped egg</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought one of these for my husband, grandson &amp; daugher but she lost hers &amp; needed a new one.  It&#x27;s one of those essentials that every person should have in their grooming kit.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality. Very pleased with this item. Great gift. Highly recommend. Wonderful value and I plan on buying more very soon.</li>
    <li> I happen to really love the PedEgg, but definitely NOT from this seller. I am SO disappointed... I bought my first egg from CVS,and I wish I had this time... The packaging was torn and dusty, and the egg itself was chipped on one side, and looks filled down on the insides of the egg. And the grater, itself, had smudges on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE SELLER! Just go to your local drugstore and get it, &#x27;cause this is not a true representation of the product. I&#x27;ll buy STRICTLY Amazon from now on. And I want my money back.</li>
    <li> Well, it does what it says it does, so be careful. I ended up with a large pile of dead skin as it was kind of fun in a weird way...but when I woke up the next day, my feet were a little sore to walk on.</li>
    <li> I love this thing its amazing and I got it in black which made it even cooler! I used it as soon as I got it and my feet are now so soft and pretty :D Love this thing!</li>
    <li> Product as advertised, arrived on schedule. This product will save you many trips to the Podietrist at a fraction of the medical bills....</li>
    <li> My boyfriend didn&#x27;t like it. But it appeared to do exactly as it said it did.</li>
    <li> My Doctor suggested I get this product to use on my foot.  It works geat.</li>
    <li> Read the mixed reviews but decided to try anyway.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the $10 as it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> The first Ped Egg I purchased was when they first hit the market it was fantastic, great quality all around and very durable. The one I just purchased is just awful, very poorly manufactured. Be weary of the prices and shipping locations, the good ones are still out there and you may pay $3-5 more, but its worth it over the fake, cheaply made \\&quot;Ped-Eggs\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have awful callouses on the balls of my feet, sides of my big toes, and heels. I&#x27;ve had them ever since I was younger and I think i started getting them from basketball and volleyball shoes. The last time I went to get a pedicure, the lady used a scary callous shaver and I will not go back. I decided to try out the ped egg and I am so glad I did!!! It has made a dramatic difference in my feet after only 2 days. I highly recommend it instead of a costly and possibly dangerous trip to the nail spa!</li>
    <li> LIke many people, this is my second Ped-Egg.  I wish I had read the reviews before buying this piece of junk.  I just saw \\&quot;Ped-Egg\\&quot; and expected to get the same quality I did the first time.  I&#x27;ve had my first Ped-Egg for several years now and the blades were just a bit dull after so much use.  The piece of crap that arrived today is nothing like my first Ped-Egg, it&#x27;s cheaply made and ineffective.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> We certainly got plenty of product for our money but the steel filing blades are&lt;br /&gt;very weak.  The emery board material that you apply to the bottom of the container&lt;br /&gt;to do finishing is more effective than the blades.</li>
    <li> This is no better than any other foot file.  It&#x27;s cheaply made and difficult to open.  It does slough off some dead skin, but not enough to make a discernible difference and certainly not better than any other comparably priced file on the market.  Major disappointment.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is meant to do. It works well. It&#x27;s not sharp so it won&#x27;t cut you. I&#x27;ve used several different foot files. I&#x27;ve even tried the one with the blade in it, now that one CAN hurt you. This one works the best of all I have tried. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess. It holds the shavings until your ready to clean it out. I bought some for Christmas presents. Perfect for stockings.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think, and I hesitated but finally gave in and paid the $10 to give it a try.  I have spent SO much money over the years in pedicures, special lotions and gadgets to keep my feet in shape.  They are very dry, calloused and can be painful at times. This is truly the first thing I have found that has worked, my feet have never been so soft!  I still can&#x27;t believe it and have to touch them every so often to make sure they are still soft.  I follow with the Miracle Foot Repair, which I already had, and socks. I am definitely a believer now!</li>
    <li> This product is great for taking off dead skin &amp; callous from feet but don&#x27;t over do it! Your feet will be sore the next day. I suggest you soak your feet first, then use the ped-egg, smooth over with a pumice stone &amp; then cream. You feet will be \\&quot;Summer\\&quot; ready!&lt;br /&gt;The product is similar to a mini cheese grater. The shape makes it easy to use. The only negative thing I can think of is that it is often difficult to open.</li>
    <li> This works really well on callouses.  The package says all the shards stay in the egg.  They didn&#x27;t for me.  Next time I will do the deed outside or over some old newspaper.</li>
    <li> This works just as advertised (how often does THAT happen?) Totally pain free, relatively little physical exterion required even with rough, dry heels. Clean and neater than a plain old hand held file. I love the little sand paper (smoother they call it) that comes with this set.</li>
    <li> This actually does exactly what is says it will do; it removes calluses and dry build up on feet.  I bought the one with the handle and it takes seconds to rid feet of dryness.</li>
    <li> I love the ped egg. In the past none of those sloughing creams worked, even though I&#x27;ve seen them work on other people. This has been the only product that has helped me. I didn&#x27;t recieve the regular ped egg though, I got the ped egg platinum (which is even better in my opinion and fits the original ped egg half as well). Takes about ten mins of work and my skin are pretty smooth. i&#x27;ll be sure to order more..</li>
    <li> Like other telemarketers, they add other items to the list ONLY after you say yes.  Why do you think they say \\&quot;we&#x27;ll give you a second free if you purchase with a credit card\\&quot;?  The telemarketing company is a scam yes, but the product itself works wonders.  Before using it I never wanted to wear sandals because of my \\&quot;crusty\\&quot; feet.  After minutes of filing correctly and using the emery board, my feet were smooth.  I tried to grip my sheets with the heel of my foot as I would before and nothing happened (meaning the Ped Egg worked.)  Afterwards, you should apply some type of cream or moisturizer to keep your feet smooth.  Like others have spoken before, the \\&quot;egg\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t really catch or keep your shavings because the shavings are dust-like. Other than that, go for it.  Only order from Amazon if you doing it online, other than that go to your local CVS, Walgreens, or other stores that sell \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; items. $10 and without the shipping.</li>
    <li> Based on previous reviews, I was hoping this foot file would do a better job with tough callouses.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t hold up to my expectations.  It may work OK on minor rough patches of skin, but it just doesn&#x27;t help with true callouses.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> I had my first pedicure several weeks ago and after seeing the huge amount of dead skin that was removed, I decided to maintain and get a Ped Egg.     All this device has done is pull the dead skin down so it&#x27;s even more visible; it does not detach it from my foot at all. (Yes, my feet were dry). It also made my left foot sore. I feel like the blades need to be sharper to be effective.     Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Being completely honest, the one I bought from the dollar store with a handle did a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t grip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal wore out so I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sandpaper side is completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should cost 2 bucks at most.</li>
    <li> these worked like a charm. I have rough heels and it took care of it no problem. thanks to the inventor for letting us have smooth heels finally. worth every penny</li>
    <li> I first found out about these during one of my pedicures, and loved the idea since it catches all the dead skin and makes it easy to be rid of, but yes, you are not supposed to use it after soaking your feet, but most do anyway, and yes it&#x27;s like a cheese grater, it only goes up and down. I love it! Downside is it&#x27;s small size makes it relatively easy to lose haha (at least for my boyfriend) &gt;_&gt;</li>
    <li> this foot file worked great at first usage but after repeat usage the sharpness of the minute cutters seem to became dull and does not do a good job</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in the past and have had good luck.  This time, however, the quality is extremely lacking.  The filing part of the product is not of good quality and is quite disappointing.</li>
    <li> I just bought it last week.  I tired it again and again but it didn&#x27;t work at all!!  It wastes my money!!</li>
    <li> It was a knockoff of the real ped egg. The medal on the file was bent and jagged in places.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ped Eggs for years and I love them. I hate this one though. None of the stores where we currently live carry them but I figured it would be easy to buy one online. There file on this one is dole and poorly made, it tore up my heal :(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like original. Quality is not there. It sucks. So buyEr beware. I seems like a knockoff. Even the sand paper.</li>
    <li> My feet have always been cracked and dry, to the point where it would crack and feel like a sliver of glass. I tried pumice stones, multiple foot creams and nothing worked. I just tried this and my feet feel like my newborn daughters feet. Its amazing. Only thing I would complain about was it didn&#x27;t hold the shavings too well, it just seemed to make a mess everywhere. My feet have never been this soft and smooth so I am very satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> my feet have never been so smooth!</li>
    <li> I had pretty smooth soles before and using this seems to have made them worse. I think I have uneven layers of skin now and there are parts that always look dry/cracked when it was never that way before. Also if you don&#x27;t hold it exactly right, all the foot shavings will fall out. Not sure who can keep the bottom of their foot parallel to the ground while using this, but that&#x27;s what you have to accomplish to keep from making a mess. Just go get a pedicure, for real.</li>
    <li> After purchasing and losing an original Ped Egg, I bought this product.  I liked my original Ped Egg, but this one performs much worse.  The dull grating surface almost feels like aluminum foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product was &amp;#34;Pedi-Egg&amp;#34; or a knockoff brand Ped Egg.  It was shaped the same and had a grater but it was not the real Ped Egg brand.  This is being shipped by multiple vendors and I got one from somebody who sells knockoffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works I guess because it grates particles off of your foot, but this isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
    <li> good but wore out too fast</li>
    <li> For some reason, the new units have a thinner sheet of metal that doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as the older models.  I will now need to find an alternative if this is the new product.</li>
    <li> quality was very very poor. Disappointed much</li>
    <li> Maybe it works, maybe it doesn&#x27;t?? The product looks fine but..for how long do you have to scrub until you notice the difference? Could it be that the blades are not sharp enough? Maybe if I use it twice a day every day it would work</li>
    <li> At first I loved this and saw great results, but even using it according to directions, it seems to have dulled considerably. I feel I got my money&#x27;s worth out of it, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have one ped egg from Walgreens years ago. It still works great. This time I just bought one as a gift. However, when I receive the product from UnbelievableDealz. I noticed the difference. The file itself is very flimsy. When I touch it with my finger, it hurts, while the previous one doesn&#x27;t. Also the egg is much softer and have big gaps between the parts. The product is white, but it looks dirty. The printed name on the egg is vague too. Overall, I do not think it is a genuine product and already contacted amazon for return.&lt;br /&gt;Buyers be aware.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product ever. Did nothing for my feet and I tried for 15 minutes! Barely remove any of the dead skin and didn&#x27;t catch any of it. Waste of money,  I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Even though it seal, but it look terrible inside. It look like someone use it before :( Not what I expected....</li>
    <li> I like it, it does the job, its not super clean like advertised though, as you are working it on your foot the skin will come out of the holes, If you have someone else do it for you thee skin may stay inside the hold, But the whole purpose of this is for a DIY.  The smoothing pads are crap though I will say that.  The file part is okay, hopefully it holds up for awhile.</li>
    <li> I felt silly buying a TV-advertised gadget, but the heels of my feet get so bad that I was desperate for solutions. This thing really works! It&#x27;s not at all painful and I really love the way it catches the dead skin rather than leaving it flying all over the place. I keep mine in the drawer of a table next to the sofa and use it while watching TV. That way I&#x27;m pretty much guaranteed to do something about my rough heels, rather than putting it off for &amp;#34;when I have time&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Completely Satisfied !!!</li>
    <li> After seeing several &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; commercials, this one of the products I had to have! First use did hardly anything. Second use wasn&#x27;t any better. Third use, it did absolutely nothing. It was already dull! My feet aren&#x27;t that bad but I&#x27;ve seen better results from dollar store products! I was highly disappointed in this product and would most definitely NOT recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product since it&#x27;s inception and is overall very happy with the Pedegg. I decided to use Amazon to purchase one as a stocking stuffer this Xmas and was shocked to see that the product was nothing like the one you buy in drugstores like CVS or Walgreens. Upon arrival, you could tell something was off about the product. The packaging was faded, the outer plastic was not a tight fit and ultimately, the Pedegg itself was not up to standard. The blade did not work as well and the sticky tape for the file was non-existant. I truly believe this was a counterfeit and am surprised that Amazon allows such items for sale. Very disappointed! Beware!</li>
    <li> Although the order came quickly. I was very disappointed. The item was dirty. No instructions on how to use it. After cleaning the plastic I tried it and was glad I also ordered a pumice stone. That did the job much better. Any how live and learn. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> This was to be my first purchase of a Ped Egg but when I got the package today, the box says \\&quot;How One\\&quot; and it has the \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; logo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clearly not the real deal. The blade has some evidence of rust on it and it looks of poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe Amazon is allowing this company to sell an obvious illegal knock-off of a real product. Not as advertised.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this was sent to me. The packaging is nothing like the picture. It was in a small cardboard box, not sealed and bent up. When I opened it up the blade doesn&#x27;t stay in place and the top of the egg was dirty- yuck! Sending this back immediately.</li>
    <li> Great Service!  Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  Will order again from this company!</li>
    <li> This worked really well... At first. Basically just the first time. Now I have to rub my foot a million times (and they arent even that bad).</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin on my feet and I needed something that would take care of it.  I bought the Ped Egg in hopes that it would help to get rid of my problem.  After watching the commercials on TV and deciding maybe this is my miracle cure I was very disappointed. It took about half hour on each foot and lot&#x27;s of physical work that  barely made a dent. I just got tired and realized I had just wasted $14 at Bed,Bath and Beyond. I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone unless you don&#x27;t have a problem with dry feet but just want to do a light buffing to your feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ped Eggs since they first came on the market, and gifting them to everyone I know as well. I&#x27;d never bought one on Amazon, however, and after reports of off-brands, was a bit leary of doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I purchased mine from VM Solutions Group and hoped for the best. I received a Ped Egg \\&quot;Platinum\\&quot; in black (complete with brand name on the Egg itself), without standard packaging, with five files included. I&#x27;d never used the \\&quot;Platinum\\&quot; Ped Egg before, but it seems to work just as well as the regular, white Ped Eggs I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the roll of the dice regarding whether or not one will receive a Ped Egg or a generic version of same, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing another Ped Egg on Amazon, but if I do, it&#x27;ll almost certainly be from VM Solutions.</li>
    <li> Save your time and money.  This is not an original Ped Egg, but a cheap knock-off.  Packaging was dirty and flimsy. Item looked like it was previously used.  I returned it for a full refund.</li>
    <li> The pedi egg works just make sure you clean it right after use.and buy more smoothing strips it only comes with 2.</li>
    <li> I had one and lost it.  I&#x27;m glad I found it here.  Many more on the market but they didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I like this product but i dont think it works better then anything else i tryed thats why i rated this a four not a five because i have used other things that work just as well as this. Plus it is hard to open it up to get the dead skin shaving out of it.</li>
    <li> Seems like the product I received was a knock off and not the real product replacement blades.  it was Horrible quality</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Ped Egg I bought a few years ago in the store. Don&#x27;t know if my feet have become rougher or if the quality of the product declined.</li>
    <li> My Wife wanted one of these badly.The price of this on tv was crazy,but thanks to this seller,the price was just perfect.My wife uses this allot and it works like a charm.If you have tired sore feet and see calluses and hard skin,you need to have one of these.Your feet will thank you and you will feel allot better after.</li>
    <li> It took time to get it to work but once it did it worked very well and smoothed out my feet.</li>
    <li> Even though this product resembles one I originally purchased at a local store last year, the quality of the one I purchased here was not the same. I ordered this product in hopes of acquiring additional foot file pads, but was disappointed to find only one in the package, and the shaver side of the unit not as sturdy in comparison to the one I originally purchased in-store. The original package included two foot file pads, where this one only one, and the one I received was very cheap, in fact, it was trashed after only one use, where the others lasted months. If anyone finds a place where they sell just replacement foot file pads for this product, please shout out! Otherwise, wake-up Pedi-Egg, give the consumer what they need. But then again, it&#x27;s more profitable for the manufacturer to make the consumer buy a whole new pedi-egg each time. Ah-ha I see now. :(</li>
    <li> My feet and especially heels have been in terrible shape for years with dry, thick callouses that cracked and bled.  I was so embarrassed I would not go barefoot or wear sandals in the summer.  I saw the Ped Egg on TV and did not believe that it would be able to help my terrible feet.  After the first use my dry heels were baby soft.  I can&#x27;t believe it!  I had tried every cream, buffer, file, cutter and stone on the market to no avail.  5 minutes with the Ped Egg is all it took.  Now I use it once a week to keep my feet baby soft.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat of a foot fanatic. If it&#x27;s 50 degrees or above, I have flip-flops on, sandals or I am bare-foot. My toenails are always painted - pedicures are one of my favorite treats. I saw the reviews on this item and thought I should give it a try. I&#x27;m not all that impressed. If you have really dry, thick skin on your heels, you will have to rub for a long time to get a nice smooth surface. It says that it catches all the dry skin &#x27;shavings&#x27;...which is true - unless you turn the egg upside-down...then the foot dust falls out the grates (and it is your own dust). I have better luck with my $1.99 foot file from Wal-Mart. This also came with two emery-board type stickers for the bottom of the egg...good luck getting the plastic backing off to adhere it. I ruined both trying to peel the backing off. Like I said, this egg is ok. But I will stick with my foot file. Enjoy your happy feet!</li>
    <li> I bought my ped-egg from Walgreens, and I was looking forward to seeing a change in my rough heels.  I am still waiting to see some difference.  I have finally given up on it and went back to my blade shaver.</li>
    <li> i was pleasntly surprised - everything was great, it came in the original packaging and works as advertsied.</li>
    <li> This thing just sucks. It&#x27;s the worst foot tool I&#x27;ve ever used. My feet are hardly in bad shape and they barely improved after using the ped egg. I had to scrape very vigorously and for quite a long time to see any results at all. Now the filing surface is completely dull. Worst of all, the foot shavings get EVERYWHERE - half of them fall out  of the egg through the holes in the file. If this cost under $5.00, I wouldn&#x27;t be so irate. But for the price, it is very poor quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I lost my PedEgg a long time ago on vacation and missed it a lot, so I ordered this. I was sadly disappointed. The package came and it was so filthy. It had tons of dust and dirt, and the \\&quot;PedEgg\\&quot; itself was filthy. It also did not have the logo for PedEgg as advertised on the seller&#x27;s page here. This is a knock off of a PedEgg and does not work. It felt like a cheese grater to my foot and caused pain. Save yourself some time and pain and just go to a CVS or Walgreens to pick up an authentic PedEgg. Don&#x27;t buy this trash.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Mom for Mother&#x27;s day because she&#x27;d been saying she wanted one. I also ordered other foot care related things to make a gift basket. I was excited when the package arrived today; until I opened the box. I ordered this NEW. The package was sealed except for about an inch and a half on the side towards the top. The Ped Egg itself looks gross. I have no idea what the nasty yellowish greasy looking residue is on the metal part, nor the black flaky bits. It looks like it has been sitting opened next to a stove while someone fried food for a few months before being shipped. It is seriously disgusting. Now I have to go find another one at a store when I&#x27;ve already wasted money on this. I wish I could upload a picture so that other customers could see this.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, very happy with the product,:-) meet description given for product works great and easy to use, I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I have been having some foot issues and this product has been helpful at this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a bot and I.wasnt paid for this re ie seriously!!! I was I&#x27;m pressed with how fast I received my pedegg and it came in a cool n zebra stripe pattern that I haven&#x27;t seen around my area.  Great product great exerpeirnce with this site</li>
    <li> This works very well but kills my hands/wrists/arms because it is a lot of work.  I could go get a pedicure but I&#x27;m cheap and would rather do it myself.  So yes, I will deal with the soreness.  Yeah, it makes me happy to be able to do this for virtually no cost.  Maybe do it every other month but with summer here, every 3 weeks or something??</li>
    <li> I purchased a Ped Egg when they first came out on the market and loved it. I lost mine when I moved last year, so I wanted to purchase another one. I guess they make them different now because this is very cheap. It doesn&#x27;t stay closed properly and the metal file bends and pops when being used. It&#x27;s a shame because this was a product that I originally loved, but the one I ordered here was horrible. I used it twice and threw it away!</li>
    <li> I just received this product 20 minutes ago and immediately sat down to file my feet.  I have been having problems with the dryness up here in the mountains and yesterday tried to buff the sides of my feet..disaster!  I could hardly walk on my left foot, the buffer hurt it so.  I had to put Neosporin on it, and a band aid, and keep my foot elevated.  It felt better this morning but I still had that rough edge to the outside of my foot (actually both feet.) And I still had the crack in my left foot and it still hurt but not as much.  Well I have to tell you this Ped Egg works!  It gently files the dead skin off, not in a rough way but it just shaves it off.  I am so happy that I finally found something for my poor feet as getting a pedicure every week is too costly and they hurt my feet sometimes. The crack is almost gone too and my foot doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product is an official Ped Egg...mine looks exactly like the product description on Amazon.  It is black.  I was so anxious to get the rough stuff off my feet I didn&#x27;t even use the emery file attachment that comes with the Egg.  I used a emery board instead and I can only imagine that the attachment would have done a better and smoother job of it..Make sure you read the directions...:)</li>
    <li> All I have to say is be very careful with it! Like many other reviews, it&#x27;s very similar to a cheese grater and if you don&#x27;t take it easy and lightly on your feet, you&#x27;ll hurt yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m diabetic and I want to take care of my feet and I know they have been flaking all over the place and one part on my heel is hard. So I used the one my mom and dad use and after using both the file and smoother, plus a scrub and lotion, they feel fantastic! Just please be careful when using it! If you don&#x27;t trust it not being authentic, you can pretty much find it anywhere nowadays! Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond, and more! Make sure it&#x27;s authentic!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was the original ped egg and it still does wonders i bought me and my husband one and i reccomend anyone to get one.</li>
    <li> I bought a Peg Egg about 2 years ago at the local Fry&#x27;s. It had worked great for 2 years w/o replacing the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one on Amazon because I misplaced my old one. This one is horrendous and does not work at all. I&#x27;m going to return this and get one from Fry&#x27;s again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get many pedicures so for me this thing was a waste of time. After 20 minutes using this freaking thing not only was I exhausted, my back hurt, but I made near zero progress on my calluses and corns. There are better options out there like pumice stones. Avoid this stupid thing.</li>
    <li> For this being my first time trying a PedEgg, I was very impressed! The packaging was a little beat up when I received it, but that was only because the mail service here in Chicago doesn&#x27;t take very good care of your mail sometimes. In terms of the actual PedEgg itself, it works perfectly, and the emery boards (2, to be exact) that it comes with leave your feet feeling soft! It is also very easy to clean! Recommended use is once every 2 days, then you can eventually pick it up or decrease it based on your preferences.</li>
    <li> It works well on exfoliating my feet, but the metal pad is so difficult to remove it makes cleaning next to impossible.</li>
    <li> Works well at first but if you  get a little too much skin off it will hurt very badly a day or 2 later.&lt;br /&gt;I tried several times and  I am not too rough or anything and it keeps happening. Sometimes ends up cracking feet worse and bleed :(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned it  for a year&lt;br /&gt;Ohhhh.. and you dead skin that is inside the pedegg falls out of the grater, while your pedegging your foot...</li>
    <li> Ok so definitely don&#x27;t do this everyday, or you&#x27;ll cut up your feet like my friend did! The couple of times I have used it my feet were very smooth, but after a couple of days they&#x27;re back to being cracked. I suppose it&#x27;s my own fault since I don&#x27;t do a whole process of PedEgg-ing &amp; lotion and socks, etc. Otherwise, it&#x27;s $10 and perfect if you&#x27;re in a rush &amp; can&#x27;t get to the nail salon!</li>
    <li> I own a home that is full of tile, my feet are often very calloused.  This has been a problem for years and so extreme that I was embarrassed to go to salons to get a pedicure. Then this inexpensive little miracle came around and it was my heels best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure why there are a few bad reviews, this worked perfectly for me. A helpful hint: you DO need to probably soak your feet in hot water for about 10-15 minutes prior to using the pedegg. This will soften your skin and will help the process of removal. I use this 2-3 times a week and my feet have never been so smooth. It also has an emory board you can attach which in included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is superb. The egg-like shape fits comfortably in your palm. Any skin cells that flake off are stored inside, no mess at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s the best ten bucks I could ever spend for my feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update--3/26/14: I found another foot file called the Microplane which you may purchase on Amazon. The Ped Egg worked well but the microplane works wonders! It is now my foot file of choice.</li>
    <li> Thru the years I have purchased DOZENS of various scratch pads, emory boards, things on a rope to ....get the dead skin off my feet and make them at least reasonable smooth......and then after about 15 yrs of buying those other things and quickly throwing away I discovered PED EGG...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ped Egg is the BEST......I bought this one AND the one with the handle and LOVE them both......get the one with the handle though, trust me, it is a little easier to use......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ped Egg just rocks....</li>
    <li> It really helps keep my callouses in check when I&#x27;m training for a race and I never run out of Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li> I bought this for about $8 on the military base. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I have to remove calluses from my feet every week or two. It works alright but takes a bit too long. I get better results using a callus remover and foot file after soaking my feet in the bathtub. This can also be a bit messy, so use it over a towel. The file pads wear out and have to be replaced. It&#x27;s cheaper just to buy blades for the callus remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a complete failure, but it is too much effort to remove the calluses. The results aren&#x27;t as smooth as what I can get from a foot file. Tweezerman makes a good callus remover and foot file. I threw the Ped Egg away once the second pad wore out.</li>
    <li> This was a little too cheap the parts didnt match up right so they cant lock in the file thing into the egg. I was pretty bummed but this thing was really cheap so I guess not too big a deal.</li>
    <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve had in years!!!! After just one use, my feet look better than they did days, months, even years ago!</li>
    <li> this doesw work. A great gift for anyone looking to get rid of some extra crust. loll. i recommend it</li>
    <li> I find myself using the emery bottom of the Pedi-egg more than the other. Sometimes, although I do it gently, the metal part just ends up putting little tears in my dried out heel callouses rather than removing them. So it&#x27;s like rubbing torn skin back and forth. This is just MY experience. Other time it helps remove easy dead skin, but the rest of the time it doesn&#x27;t. I end up picking at my feet and pulling the skin off, making my skin sore and even worse than before when it tears it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think keeping your feet moisturized and using an emery board on DRY feet when needed works better than using the main part of this. At least that doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife because she has dry skin on her heels.&lt;br /&gt;It requires a bit of work and patience (~20 minutes) as we scraped the dry and dead skins off her heels.&lt;br /&gt;Once we smoothed the skin with fine grid sandpaper, and applied lotion to them, they were marvelous to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rp</li>
    <li> Feels cheap and doesn&#x27;t seem to work - not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not using it correctly - or if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> For the price and purpose, the product delivers. Its a great invention...  Beware not to flip it upside or all the dry skin shavings will fall out all over(yuck!)</li>
    <li> I have thick callouses, so it does give me a slight work out lol. Best before bed, or on my day off (that I know I do not have to be on my feet a lot)</li>
    <li> I only use this product to remove ingrained bunyons and other crap. It works really well. Almost like a people grater.</li>
    <li> I have good feet, but after the summer season and the sandal wearing every day, they had gotten pretty rough around the heel etc...  I used my regular file, but after a ot of effort with that, my feet actually came out rougher.  It seems it only worked when my feet were just a tiny bit calloused.  The Ped Egg fixed it in one use, with much less work.  After two uses my feet were better than before the summer (previously I had thought they couldn&#x27;t get any better or smoother).  I love this thing!</li>
    <li> I got this thing and its so cheap, it doesn&#x27;t fit together well. It feels like its ready to fall apart, and when I finally got this thing, the package was torn to shreds and it looked like it was run over repeatedly! Waste of time and money. There are much better products than this thing.</li>
    <li> I saw this on tv but looked for it here and found it at a much better price and it actually works! Wow! My feet are nice and soft :)</li>
    <li> I wish that this was the battery operated model as I thought that was what I was buying...but no worries..just put in a little elbow grease and POOF!......lotsa dead skin buffed away in minutes!</li>
    <li> Works great, and it&#x27;s also a little creepy to see how much dead skin comes off your foot.  Feels a little strange at first, tickles kinda, but after a few seconds you get used to it and start scrapping away.  Feels good after, put a little lotion in your hands and rub down your feet... feels good man</li>
    <li> Used it several times and I am so glad that I purchased it.  works wonderfully I would recomment it to anyone.</li>
    <li> If you have never used one of these and have rough, dry feet, I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s very simple to use and works well. At first I thought that it would hurt to use, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. It fits perfectly into the palm of your hand and doesn&#x27;t cause any discomfort at all. Once you finish with the metal part your feet feel pretty rough, but there is a piece of fine grain sand paper like stuff that smooths your feet into a nice finish. The only thing is you want to take it slow at first. If you have a place with a large callus, removing too much at once could make your foot sore.</li>
    <li> I have thick calluses on my big toes from fallen arches and was hoping this would take them off.  After a struggle to figure out how to open and use this thing due to a total lack of instructions, I got it together and tried it out.  I went back and forth over and over, but after around 50 strokes it had done virtually nothing. This product is a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item in the hopes of getting a quality item based off of reviews from people online even outside of the amazon website. The seller of this product has no care of delivering quality items because when I received my ped egg it seemed like they may have sent me a used item. The packaging seemed a little dusty which I thought was a cause the truck it was being delivered on or something, but when I opened it the product looked used and the file part of it had a lot of smudges on it as if someone attempted to wipe it off. Upon opening the actual egg it was filled with dirt and the file itself was dented. From the looks of it I have wasted 11 dollars only to get crap. Do yourselves a favor and look somewhere outside of this crappy seller.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was a little unsure about the product not being an actual \\&quot;Ped Egg\\&quot; So I contacted the seller through email and they assured me that is was an actual Ped Egg. So I ordered it, and it was the real thing :) I got the black one and it works great! Great price too! Will buy more as gifts....</li>
    <li> It looked used, it had stains, so I washed it twice and used it after anyway. The blades didn&#x27;t seem new. It did improve my feet a bit but the egg felt very dull and didn&#x27;t seem new at all.</li>
    <li> So I was not expecting a cheese grater for my feet LOL! It&#x27;s exactly what it is. Looks a little intimidating, thought I was going to slice pieces of my foot off so I was scared truly. It did not harm my feet at all though. Read the directions and don&#x27;t be afraid of it and you&#x27;ll be fine. I love mine now, makes my very very icky hard feet smooth like a babies! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all.  The electric Bario is so much better.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it!  Works as described! She uses it almost daily!  Very easy to hold and to use as well.</li>
    <li> This was definitely a generic ped egg. I bought it as a replacement and ended up using my old one.</li>
    <li> I found Ped Egg some time back but couldn&#x27;t find mine. I ordered this one and it was just as good as my first one. I hear they have a newer one that is even better but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. This one will really help and is safe. It&#x27;s far superior to graters or sanders. I don&#x27;t use the sanding paper that stick on the bottom. I use a sandpaper covered sponge I bought at the beauty school from the gal that did my husband&#x27;s pedicure.</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these when they were sold in stores.. and it seems like this one is a lighter plastic, thinner metal, and the emery cloth glue doesn&#x27;t stick to the plastic. The glue has dried up. you&#x27;re better off buying a micro planer from the kitchen goods and just buy a sand stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the day these used to work better, but I think the quality has gone down since the metal bends with hardly any pressure and the plastic lid falls off too.. doesn&#x27;t stay snapped together.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. I bought a generic brand from target that was better than this.</li>
    <li> It really works. It is easy to use and really does remove dead skin quickly and easily. Much better that any other product I have tried.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a Ped Egg before, but this one appears to be a cheap knock-off. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work, would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and re order every 3/4 months. Does the job well and seller does great job in shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been to the podiatrist who cleaned up my heels and prescribed me some cream a couple years ago. He had to take a knife and electric tool to get them smooth and fix the cracks. They got bad again and have been hurting so my wife found this and bought it on a whim. Yeah, it really does work remarkably well. As good as the podiatrist a couple years ago.</li>
    <li> this works great for getting your heels nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> This works great.  that&#x27;s all I need to say but Amazon requires a certain number of words.  Frusstrating.  But just know this actually works!  Better than blades or other metal pedi things  This shaves and smooths  Awesome</li>
    <li> This product is a great buy.  It appears just as shown in photo. Great quality. I will order again from this company.</li>
    <li> My Ped Egg arrived in black (like pictured) and it was labeled as &amp;#34;Ped Egg&amp;#34;  on the product and not some cheap knock-off brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have no complaints it arrived and works exactly as advertised.  I had never used this or a similar product so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  I used as directed and after 30-40 of use on both feet, I opened the container to find it 1/4 full of dead skin!  I was taken away at first and kind of grossed out.  I especially used it on my heel and callouses and it filed them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my feet stay cooler and comfortable without that layer of thick dead skin.  I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The one I received is a fake knock-off. I threw it out because it was so cheap and funky. I ended up getting the real thing at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> Best foot thing ever!  It shaves off all my gross foot stuff in no time.  Combined with moisturizing after and my feet are feeling good!</li>
    <li> I decided to take my chances and see if I happened to get a real PedEgg from this listing.  I should have listened to other reviewers!  What I got was a cheap knock-off, with no brand name, in flimsy plastic packaging.  I didn&#x27;t even have to open the package to see that this foot file arrived filthy.  It had fingerprints and smudges all over it.  Absolutely disgusting. I got my return label, mailed it the next day, and went straight to my local pharmacy to buy a real, clean PedEgg.</li>
    <li> Purchased from (iParty Warehouse)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minute I opened my package, I knew something was wrong. The plastic it came in looked damaged. This product is by is a \\&quot;Double Foot File\\&quot; by FamilyMaid, NOT a Ped Egg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is distributed by Dollar Empire LLC. You mean to tell me that I paid $10 for something that I could have bought for A DOLLAR at The Dollar Tree or The 99 Cent Store?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outer shell of the \\&quot;egg\\&quot; is damaged as if it was used before it was even packaged. There were no directions ANYWHERE on this package or inside. The blades look like a cheese grater! A very cheap cheese grater that will probably fall off the minute water hits the glue that&#x27;s keeping this thin sheet of tin attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also two little emery pieces, but only god knows what I&#x27;m supposed to do with those-- there are no directions and they don&#x27;t seem to fit anywhere on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so mad I bought this, but I don&#x27;t know if I can return it-- I already opened it to inspect it, and the company didn&#x27;t even send me a frickin&#x27; packing slip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT ORDER THIS. PLEASE. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, how are they even allowed to call this a Ped Egg? Isn&#x27;t there some kind of trademark on that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this 0 stars if I could. Nothing about this is right!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good on the calluses on the bottom of my feet.</li>
    <li> I love this product since the first one I have ever used I should have bought more then one as a matter of fact i will go buy more now</li>
    <li> Love this, it actually works!</li>
    <li> Sorry my words but this thing is another peace of chunk made in China that did not make it over one month before hitting the landfill. Would be nice if Amazon would restrict Users from writing a review withing the first three month.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It is easy to store, handle and empty.  I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it was a great deal compared to the ones you find in convenience stores. It works, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;ve never tried these, they are great! removes all the dead cracked heel skin and painlessly and neatly. hard to find replacement blades any more in town so I just bought myself a new one. totally awesome product! :)</li>
    <li> Works great just as advertised. Easy to assemble. Used the day it was received. Shipped fast. No hassles with any part of the process! Sized for a womens hand, hard for hubby to use :(</li>
    <li> Shipped in a timely manor. Price was great. Gave it as a present to my mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Have had this for awhile now, and appreciate it anew each time I use it. This thing works! Yeah, it feels really weird &amp;#34;grating&amp;#34; ones feet, but let&#x27;s face it, we women do a lot of things that aren&#x27;t pretty to stay pretty. All I know is this thing takes all that disgusting dead skin off where it needs to come off, and for that, I am grateful.</li>
    <li> I like to wear open heels in the Spring/Summer.  I always get terrible callouses  on my heels.  This thing shaves them down to practically nothing and really makes a very irritating nuisance go away.</li>
    <li> I received the real Ped Egg Professional (with TM marking as well), I assume this is the real one.  The product is low quality and the \\&quot;grating\\&quot; feature is made of light tin metal and not very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I tested it on my feet which, by the way are not even that hard or with excessive dead skin.  Testing was done both ways, dry and wet.  With dry feet the  grating features hardly works.  With wet feet the Ped Egg works slightly better.  The more the skin has been soaking in water the better it works, but so does a regular foot file which I ended up using  in combination with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;The Ped Egg has an ergonomic design which makes it easier to work on feet.  That aside is not worth the price.  I paid  $7 for mine but it is really worth about $2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that the best way to work dead skin on feet the professional way is with a CREDO BLADE.  This is a REAL blade that will remove the dead skin.</li>
    <li> Ped Egg does the job as it advertises.  My only complaint is the lack of a long handle on this one.  I have a hard time reaching my calluses without the long handle.</li>
    <li> I have used these before and bought another for my trip. I really like the product. It is lightweight for traveling, yet sturdy.</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk! I bought the electric one and it does nothing to remove any callous. You are better sticking with the manual model.</li>
    <li> I like the file, it does what it is intended and is easy to use.  I really do need to use it more often.</li>
    <li> Great buy, quick shipping !!!</li>
