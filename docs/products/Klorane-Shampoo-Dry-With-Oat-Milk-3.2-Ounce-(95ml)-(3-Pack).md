      <li>Best.</li>
      <li>This pack of 3 was the best deal I could find at the time I purchased.</li>
      <li>The best.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product!!!</li>
      <li>Shampoo is great, but I was sent the version with nettle, not oat milk.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>I wish this was available years and years ago!!!</li>
      <li>idk whats in this magic stuff, but it works!</li>
      <li>Great scent, easy to use and can&#x27;t imagine living without it.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and not over-powering.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love the texture of my hair</li>
      <li>make sure to follow the directions and let it sit in your hair for two minutes then comb out.</li>
      <li>I prefer the oat milk version, it seems to smell better and leave my hair softer.  </li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I have ever used and can let my hair go without washing for up to 5 days.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>The best dry shampoo that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Adds volume too for easy styling.</li>
      <li>Smell is perfectly lovely and clean.</li>
      <li>i have fine hair</li>
      <li>It blends fine with my medium-blond hair.</li>
      <li>I got hooked when i was given a travel size as a free sample.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>but so, so worth the money!</li>
      <li>The absolute BEST dry shampoo out there!  </li>
      <li>but this Klorane makes my hair look thicker as well as clean.</li>
      <li>By far the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I have tried SO many and this is hands down my favorite!  </li>
      <li>I have super oily hair (I can barely get through one full day without it looking greasy), so this product has been a huge time saver for me!</li>
      <li>It eliminates oil from your hair and gives you that fresh showered look when you don&#x27;t take a morning shower.  </li>
      <li>I will either use it in the morning and use my blow dryer to give me more volume and to get rid of some of the white, or I will spray it on before bed and wake up to clean hair.</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoo&#x27;s and none of them come even close to this product for added body and removing the oily look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite dry shampoo yet.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different types and this hands down is my favorite.</li>
      <li>does the job very well without being too powdery</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair soft and feeling fresh as if you washed it.</li>
      <li>so I know I&#x27;m not using too much.</li>
      <li>It definitely allows my hair to be work appropriate on the second day after washing (never could before).</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>The price has gone up steadily over the years, but after trying countless other brands to try and save a little money, I have never found one that is a good as this brand.</li>
      <li>My whole family uses it occasionally.</li>
      <li>My hair (short and strawberry blonde) looks far better when it&#x27;s dirty and has Klorane in it then when it&#x27;s clean!</li>
      <li>A dry washcloth works really well for me when I rub it on my roots.</li>
      <li>Expensive but worth it!!!</li>
      <li>It is a REAL LIFESAVER for me as I used to have to wash my hair ever other day or it would be so greasy...</li>
      <li>With other dry shampoos my hair would have a thick built up and become very static - there is none of that with this dry shampoo!</li>

    <li> Best. Dry. Shampoo. Ever!</li>
    <li> does the job very well without being too powdery</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! i have tried a few dry shampoos and this one is by FAR my fave! i have fine hair and i only wash twice a week with this product. it revamps your hair up and soaks up oil so well and leaves my hair feeling like i just washed it! idk whats in this magic stuff, but it works! also doesnt leave your hair gritty or powdery. make sure to follow the directions and let it sit in your hair for two minutes then comb out.</li>
    <li> The best. End of story.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I got hooked when i was given a travel size as a free sample. Now I buy in bulk! Great scent, easy to use and can&#x27;t imagine living without it. Wish they offered different colors, but this works in a pinch!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I have ever used. Smell is perfectly lovely and clean.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny!  I have dark brown hair and always got annoyed with other dry shampoos that would leave a white powdery film (even after blow drying!). This stuff does not do that. I&#x27;m so happy with the product.  I will either use it in the morning and use my blow dryer to give me more volume and to get rid of some of the white, or I will spray it on before bed and wake up to clean hair. I have super oily hair (I can barely get through one full day without it looking greasy), so this product has been a huge time saver for me!</li>
    <li> This product is terrific.  It eliminates oil from your hair and gives you that fresh showered look when you don&#x27;t take a morning shower.  My whole family uses it occasionally.</li>
    <li> The price has gone up steadily over the years, but after trying countless other brands to try and save a little money, I have never found one that is a good as this brand. I should add that I have blond hair so this spray doesn&#x27;t appear whitish on me like I&#x27;ve heard other people with darker hair mention. It blends fine with my medium-blond hair. That said, if you don&#x27;t mind the cost, this is the only dry shampoo I would recommend. This pack of 3 was the best deal I could find at the time I purchased.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite dry shampoo yet. I&#x27;ve already ordered it about 4 times from Amazon. It definitely allows my hair to be work appropriate on the second day after washing (never could before). Doesn&#x27;t smell bad and never leaves a residue (I am blonde, however, so I don&#x27;t know about brunettes).</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it!!! Actually works on greasy hair.  Adds volume too for easy styling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoo&#x27;s and none of them come even close to this product for added body and removing the oily look.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium blonde hair that isn&#x27;t thick but this Klorane makes my hair look thicker as well as clean. I keep looking and sampling once in awhile trying to find something cheaper but none of them are satisfactory. I can see though that the white powder could be noticeable on darker hair which is unfortunate. A dry washcloth works really well for me when I rub it on my roots.</li>
    <li> By far the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It completely renews my hair after a work out or after a few days of not washing it.  There is a definite visible difference when used.  My hair goes from very oily to looking like I just dried it.  I purchased from Amazon in a 3 pack for $45 (making it $15/bottle) whereas the retail is $19.99-$24.99.  I will definitely need the bulk pack.  :)</li>
    <li> Shampoo is great, but I was sent the version with nettle, not oat milk.  I prefer the oat milk version, it seems to smell better and leave my hair softer.  The nettle version is for people with oily hair.  I also have black hair and this brushes out without a trace of residue or color left in my hair.  So five stars for the product, but one star for the company that sent my order.</li>
    <li> Bought a pack of 3 bottles and 2 of them have malfunctioned, where I use them once and then something must happen with the nozzle because the next time I go to use them, the bottle is empty. I have hair above my shoulders so I know I&#x27;m not using too much. I wonder if they are selling counterfeit or damaged merchandise.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found. My hair (short and strawberry blonde) looks far better when it&#x27;s dirty and has Klorane in it then when it&#x27;s clean!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I bought this based on another reviewers comments. I used this the day after a shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t shampoo my hair for another two days!!  I did not feel oily at all.</li>
    <li> I have ordered quite a few times.  Best dry shampoo I have ever used and can let my hair go without washing for up to 5 days.  It adds volume and it&#x27;s not powdery, flaky or anything like that.  My hair is still shiny and looks like I just washed it.  It is a REAL LIFESAVER for me as I used to have to wash my hair ever other day or it would be so greasy... nasty.  It saves me a ton of time and another thing, I HATE the whole process of washing my hair, putting on mousse, blowing it dry and using the flat iron.  I wish this was available years and years ago!!!</li>
    <li> I will not use any other dry shampoo! It leaves your hair soft and feeling fresh as if you washed it. With other dry shampoos my hair would have a thick built up and become very static - there is none of that with this dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this dry shampoo. I have tried so many different types and this hands down is my favorite. I love the texture of my hair after-- feels very soft, unlike other dry shampoos I have tried that left my hair feeling &amp;#34;heavy,&amp;#34; almost sticky (think how your hair feels with a little hair spray in it).</li>
    <li> The best dry shampoo that I have ever used. The smell is nice and not over-powering. No white residue</li>
    <li> The absolute BEST dry shampoo out there!  I have tried SO many and this is hands down my favorite!  It&#x27;s a little pricey but so, so worth the money!</li>
