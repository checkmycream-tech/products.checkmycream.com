      <li>wasnt strong  to clean with</li>
      <li>Cheaply made -- you get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>This wouldn&#x27;t be worth the money at $1.99, and most assuredly is not at $4.99.  </li>
      <li>The longer bristles are softer and make it easy to clean hard-to-reach places.  </li>
      <li>Cheap and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making this tool available to Amazon customers.  </li>
      <li>I could easily find a more identical replacement at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I threw it away after the first use and buy the better one.</li>
      <li>My original cleaning brush was like that, and I do miss that when it comes to cleaning between the blades.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband was so excited on Christmas morning to find these in his stocking.</li>
      <li>Just like the original brush.</li>
      <li>It clean both electric razors and hair clipper.</li>
      <li>Purchased this to clean blades after using hairclipper.  </li>
      <li>This brush clean hard-to-reach</li>
      <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
      <li>This works just fine, with the right amount of stiffness to reach in and clean the shaver head.  </li>
      <li>Nice, soft bristles for cleaning the cracks and crevices of your shaver.</li>
      <li>The Braun brushes sold at Amazon in a two pack are much better quality at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This brush is worthy price high quality and top trusted.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>It beats using and old paint brush, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>For the price, this was worth buying.  </li>
      <li>Worth maybe $0.99.</li>
      <li>It was delivered quickly and was exactly as shown.  </li>
      <li>Very helpful to clean razor.</li>
      <li>It arrived very fast by mail.</li>
      <li>This is a handy little brush to clean both electric razors and hairclipper blades.  </li>
      <li>Short bristles could be a lot stiffer, for better cleaning.</li>
      <li>bought for cleaning the nooks and crannies of my herb grinder to make sure no residue is left.</li>
      <li>This brush is very soft to clean the razors.</li>
      <li>With normal use (daily cleaning of razor), I don&#x27;t expect this to last more than two more months.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try to find some better quality ones next time I decide to purchase new brushes.</li>
      <li>I finally realized that I could probably buy replacements, and luckily, I was right.</li>
      <li>Turning little bits of hair into gold would be a nice feature, but I&#x27;d bet they don&#x27;t have an alchemist on staff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t very rigid.</li>
      <li>It works, but bristles degrade, bend, etc, really fast.</li>
      <li>Item appears to be well made and cleans the shaver cutter block of  my Braun  Series 5 shaver very well.</li>
      <li>This works very well for the intended purpose.  </li>
      <li>I think everyone should keep this for cleaning electric shaver for daily use and must clean after every use.</li>
      <li>A long one to reach under the blades and the shorter one to clean the blades.</li>
      <li>I love this little brush.</li>
      <li>It would be more helpful to have very short bristles at one side to clean the teeth of the clippers and long &amp; broad bristles for general hair &#x27;sweeping&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clear this one will be lucky to last a couple of months.</li>
      <li>He needed a new cleaning brush for his razor.  </li>
      <li>not much to say here, I just needed it to clean my shaver.</li>
      <li>It is an extremely useful tool--I would even go so far as to say essential.</li>
      <li>Especially with the Prime account for free regular shipping.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure you can ask for anything more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a perfect brush, but it does more than an adequate job.</li>
      <li>I suspect an old tooth brush would do as well and be considerably cheaper.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t literary imagine how it would look for 1 or 2 stars.</li>
      <li>So far didn&#x27;t break it.</li>
      <li>The next time I buy a brush, I will look for one with much stiffer bristles.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t last more than a few weeks before it became so frizzled</li>
      <li>Completely unlike the original and unable to clean the shaver head.</li>
      <li>in all, I would highly recommend this product for properly maintaining an electric razor.</li>
      <li>This brush is too small and soft to clean electric shaver cutters.</li>
      <li>And on top of that, the bristles are weak and flimsy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;But a mediocre brush is better than no brush!</li>
      <li>Too small and wimpy compared to original style that came with my Braun.</li>
      <li>This item is sturdy and should last a while had tossed the old one that lasted a number of yrs..</li>
      <li>I wore my old one out to the point of no bristles left.</li>
      <li>The brushes are thinner than the original and become frayed after about 45 days to the point that they are not effective any longer.</li>
      <li>I guess my expectations were a little higher, but I can&#x27;t crucify them because the product was $5.  </li>
      <li>But seriously, it&#x27;s smaller than I expected and for the money I probably would have been better off with a small generic paint brush.</li>
      <li>,do you mean I used to clean my comb for this</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> JUST WHAT i ordered.  very happy.</li>
    <li> Kinda pricey for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> Convenient and not pricey at all.</li>
    <li> Just like the original brush. I bought several so I can afford to loose one.</li>
    <li> Cheap and effective. This little brush replaced my Oster standard clipper cleaning brush. It does it&#x27;s job well. I am really pleased with this brush as a replacement.</li>
    <li> It works.  It was delivered quickly and was exactly as shown.  Pity Norelco is cheaping out reducing the size of the brush portions.  I suspect an old tooth brush would do as well and be considerably cheaper.  But this item is good.</li>
    <li> Cheap and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I ordered two because it doesn&#x27;t seem as durable as I&#x27;d like. The bristles aren&#x27;t very rigid.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> What can you say about a shaver cleaning brush other than it could have had stiffer bristles?  Can&#x27;t complain about the price.</li>
    <li> This is a handy little brush to clean both electric razors and hairclipper blades.  Purchased this to clean blades after using hairclipper.  The bristles are stiff enough on one end to get dust and hair from between the blades.  The longer bristles are softer and make it easy to clean hard-to-reach places.  Product arrived promptly and neatly packaged.  Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This item works passably well, but the two brushes aren&#x27;t very different. It would be more helpful to have very short bristles at one side to clean the teeth of the clippers and long &amp; broad bristles for general hair &#x27;sweeping&#x27;. As it is, neither side is ideally suited to either task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a mediocre brush is better than no brush!</li>
    <li> I needed a brush for cleaning my clippers after I cut my husband&#x27;s hair. The brush that came in the clipper set was worn out. This brush serves my needs, but I guess I was expecting a larger bursh. This one is about 3 inches long.</li>
    <li> My husband was so excited on Christmas morning to find these in his stocking. It&#x27;s the little things in life that make you happy!</li>
    <li> Got this as a replacement brush for my electric shaver.  Like how it has double sides - one being longer than the other.  Took one star off for the almost $5 that it costs...but hey, still works great!</li>
    <li> I guess my expectations were a little higher, but I can&#x27;t crucify them because the product was $5.  you get what you pay for.  Brushes are flimsy, and the brush is a little too small for my liking.  With normal use (daily cleaning of razor), I don&#x27;t expect this to last more than two more months.  I doubt I will purchase another one like this, regardless of the price</li>
    <li> Works OK as a replacement for original Braun Shaver brush. I could easily find a more identical replacement at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This works very well for the intended purpose.  It replaces a brush that has lasted MANY years and is no longer available.</li>
    <li> Small toy like brush.  Completely unlike the original and unable to clean the shaver head. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this product.</li>
    <li> This brush is too small and soft to clean electric shaver cutters. The Braun brushes sold at Amazon in a two pack are much better quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  He needed a new cleaning brush for his razor.  He says it works great.</li>
    <li> The bristles are a bit limp, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> PERFECT.  Just what my husband wanted.  Kay</li>
    <li> not much to say here, I just needed it to clean my shaver. It beats using and old paint brush, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> My original brush lasted many years.  It&#x27;s clear this one will be lucky to last a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a little brush to put in the electronic shaver&#x27;s pouch so that I don&#x27;t need to bother with a big brush when I go on a trip. This is a very nice travel-sized brush.</li>
    <li> smaller than i thought</li>
    <li> Thank you for making this tool available to Amazon customers.  Worked well.</li>
    <li> Well, I don&#x27;t really know, how to evaluate this little shaver cleaner from 1 to 5 stars. It is a simple product. I can&#x27;t literary imagine how it would look for 1 or 2 stars. Would it be a different color? Or what?&lt;br /&gt;So, I gave it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t see anything what would stop from using it.</li>
    <li> For the price, this was worth buying.  Especially with the Prime account for free regular shipping.  It&#x27;s not a perfect brush, but it does more than an adequate job.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about it. It does what it has to do. I find it very small though. So far didn&#x27;t break it.</li>
    <li> The brush lasted about twenty days and fell apart. Even before then, it was not effective at removing hair from my Braun 7000 series electric razor. The next time I buy a brush, I will look for one with much stiffer bristles. This brush was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this little shaver cleaning brush to replace the one that had come with my Remington. It is an extremely useful tool--I would even go so far as to say essential. I had a lot of trouble cleaning my electric shaver without one. I finally realized that I could probably buy replacements, and luckily, I was right. Yes, sometimes I am slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Price is outstanding. You really can&#x27;t go wrong. 2 different bristle sets for different cleaning needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Small and easily misplaced, but that is more the buyer&#x27;s responsibility. Short bristles could be a lot stiffer, for better cleaning. My original cleaning brush was like that, and I do miss that when it comes to cleaning between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would highly recommend this product for properly maintaining an electric razor. It would be effective for almost any kind of shaver, even trimmers.</li>
    <li> wasnt strong  to clean with</li>
    <li> Cleans relatively well</li>
    <li> Electric shaver brush arrived sooner than expected. Item appears to be well made and cleans the shaver cutter block of  my Braun  Series 5 shaver very well.</li>
    <li> It works, but bristles degrade, bend, etc, really fast. For the money I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> as good as oem...works as advertised...received promptly...this is pretty silly having to write multiple words about a $2 item that has a specific purpose.</li>
    <li> It does what it should, and its nice and compact. I&#x27;m not sure you can ask for anything more. Turning little bits of hair into gold would be a nice feature, but I&#x27;d bet they don&#x27;t have an alchemist on staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent little brush.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the photo, which has nothing for scale.  It is scarcely bigger than a Q-tip. And on top of that, the bristles are weak and flimsy.  This wouldn&#x27;t be worth the money at $1.99, and most assuredly is not at $4.99.  Worth maybe $0.99.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft to clean the razors. I threw it away after the first use and buy the better one.</li>
    <li> In a very short amount of time the bristles fell out if the brush. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Something is different about these brushes versus the ones that come with an electric shaver you purchase.  The bristles tend to fray very easily and it ends up looking like the hair on a troll doll.  I&#x27;m going to try to find some better quality ones next time I decide to purchase new brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this little brush. I wore my old one out to the point of no bristles left. So I ordered 2 of these and I just love having 2 ends. A long one to reach under the blades and the shorter one to clean the blades.</li>
    <li> Cannot find these type replacement assesories for cleaning electric razors. This item is sturdy and should last a while had tossed the old one that lasted a number of yrs.. I recommend this item for purchase and use due to not finding this cleaning brush at any retail stores. This item only comes with a e-razor when purchased.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace the one that I lost.  Very helpful to clean razor.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I thought there were supposed to be two of the brushes, only received one.</li>
    <li> this is the second time we purchase this items.  we are very happy.</li>
    <li> Very good brush. My husband needed it for his shaver, and this was the perfect size and it works well. Good price also!</li>
    <li> Very nice for cleaning shaver n timer.</li>
    <li> thank you for carrying needed items such as these brushes!</li>
    <li> I lost my shaver brush, searched Amazon and this item came up as add on item. So I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fine for cleaning my shaver. Brush is a little smaller than I thought by it does what I need it to do. And price was great.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I use this brush on a safety razor, not an electric shaver.  It helps to keep blades clean and last longer, which means less spent on replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Nice, soft bristles for cleaning the cracks and crevices of your shaver. I say get two or three of these.</li>
    <li> I use this product since 2003 and totally satisfied. I think everyone should keep this for cleaning electric shaver for daily use and must clean after every use. It clean both electric razors and hair clipper. This brush is worthy price high quality and top trusted. This brush clean hard-to-reach places.&lt;br /&gt;This is multipurpose use you can use any razor or any electric product,do you mean I used to clean my comb for this buy two.....&lt;br /&gt;Navin Patel</li>
    <li> The brushes are thinner than the original and become frayed after about 45 days to the point that they are not effective any longer. They are sheap but you go through a lot of them</li>
    <li> For some reason, the electric shaver I received for Christmas this year didn&#x27;t include a brush.  Blowing on it sort of worked, but there were always some clippings left behind.  This works just fine, with the right amount of stiffness to reach in and clean the shaver head.  It stores easily in the zippered vinyl case that came with the shaver.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made -- you get what you pay for.  It didn&#x27;t last more than a few weeks before it became so frizzled and so many of the bristles fell out that I gave up on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this extra and it is as they described.The only thing that I didn&#x27;t care for was the x-tra high postage on such a small item.</li>
    <li> bought for cleaning the nooks and crannies of my herb grinder to make sure no residue is left. must have for anyone who is grinding herbs alot.</li>
    <li> It arrived very fast by mail. I am satisfied with this shaver brush. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Too small and wimpy compared to original style that came with my Braun.</li>
    <li> They do the job I expect of them. Finer praise would be hard to imagine. I&#x27;m told that 5 more words are required. Superfluous X 5.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush. But seriously, it&#x27;s smaller than I expected and for the money I probably would have been better off with a small generic paint brush. But&#x27;s it&#x27;s fine for what it is. Just note the size.</li>
    <li> This brush is just 2.5 inches long and 0.5 inches wide. So it is not really suited or well designed to serve as an electric shaver cleaning tool. Very disappointed and would not recomend it for that task, but might be useful for smaller electrical/battery powered items.</li>
    <li> Works great and cleans the hair from my clippers. But, the bristles got soft and bent after a few uses</li>
    <li> Terrible tool with very weak brushes; useless for cleaning my shaver and I have just thrown in my drawer. Time to throw it away!</li>
