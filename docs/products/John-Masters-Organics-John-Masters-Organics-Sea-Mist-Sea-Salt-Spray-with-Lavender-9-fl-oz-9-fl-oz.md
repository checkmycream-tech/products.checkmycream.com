      <li>John Masters Organics Sea Mist FINALLY gives me the beach hair I love!  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth trying - fun to use.</li>
      <li>No dangerous chemicals.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun to spray on to think your hair will be softer</li>
      <li>but most importantly it&#x27;s natural and it WORKS.</li>
      <li>I also love that there are minimal ingredients that are safe for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>definitely accomplishes that beach look in a very natural CHEMICAL FREE way which is important to maintaining healthy hair</li>
      <li>Sometimes it makes my hair oily, but that may be because I am not using it right.</li>
      <li>sparingly at first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried using a tiny bit of Morrocan Oil before spritzing this product in and the results seem OK.</li>
      <li>Waiting for the hot humid weather to see how well it really works.</li>
      <li>Makes by hair very beachy</li>
      <li>, my husband tried it and he wants a bottle for himself.</li>
      <li>Either approach, wavy or straight</li>
      <li>more.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really smell the lavender.</li>
      <li>but I really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll shake the curls and gently scrunch my hair to get it to fall how I want it</li>
      <li>The lavender oil that is also present in the spray keeps your hair from drying out from the salt, while also leaving your hair lightly fragrant.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job of adding texture to my thin hair too!</li>
      <li>As of right now, the only thing I like is the smell!</li>
      <li>This stuff is fun, and smells a little too powerful.</li>
      <li>The texture of my hair stays pretty natural, if a little dry, so I don&#x27;t worry about dates touching my hair the way I would if I used a heavier grease or mousse or something.</li>
      <li>I also discovered that if I put this on my hair and dry it straight and then use a hair straightener, my hair is incredibly soft and stays straight and doesn&#x27;t poof.</li>
      <li>My curls are soft and natural looking and not stiff or crunchy.</li>
      <li>the fact that it has so few ingredients, and that it is sulfate, paraben, and silicone free.</li>
      <li>I like the neutral, classy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft.</li>
      <li>After my hair is dried, I brush it, style it, shake the bottle and then use 4 squirts (one on top, one for each side, one for the back) as hairspray.</li>
      <li>dry your hair will stay how you put it but looks normal and is very flexible (would blow in the wind)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for a casual look on the weekends though!</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a decent product.</li>
      <li>the other hand: the ingredients made me furious when I first saw them.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m gradually switching to the Curly Girl method, so I will be using my brush less and less as time goes on and finger brushing more and</li>
      <li>my hair looks beachy, feels beachy (not a great feeling - but no one&#x27;s touching my hair anyway)</li>
      <li>while i do notice the salt if the spray gets on my back or arms, it feels exactly like sea water - a little prickly.</li>
      <li>With a little wax, I have a pretty low maintenance quiff that actually gets compliments from strangers.</li>
      <li>(I think the air dry and don&#x27;t brush again parts are critical to getting soft curls with no frizz.)</li>

<li> When wet my hair is half way down my back</li>
<li> Finally something that works on my long, thick, course hair</li>
<li> Product made my bleached hair a little dry and dull, but overall held my waves.</li>
<li> I can finger fluff it, but once my hair is dry, no more brushing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> i love this stuff! i can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s just salt water and lavender oil. while i do notice the salt if the spray gets on my back or arms, it feels exactly like sea water - a little prickly. also notice the salty taste when i wash my hair. but it works so well i hardly care. my hair looks beachy, feels beachy (not a great feeling - but no one&#x27;s touching my hair anyway) but most importantly it&#x27;s natural and it WORKS. i twirl my hair into ringlets and spray and twirl and spray some more. it&#x27;s great. love it.</li>
    <li> After reading lots of good reviews about this product a decided to purchase...and I hate it! When wet my hair is half way down my back but once dry it shrinks up almost to my shoulders. I have curly, fine (see through fine) hair. I used this product today for the first time and my hair has never looked worse. I used it on damp hair..sparingly at first. Ended up with the biggest frizziest Afro ever!! So I tried again...added more. Again...Afro. So I tried again by adding more. My hair is sooooo frizzy! It&#x27;s sticking out! It also feels dry, dull, and has zero shine. I would compare it to HAY!! I am hoping someone can give me some help as to the best way to use this. As of right now, the only thing I like is the smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, and I love it! My hair is shoulder length (when dry) with a lot of natural wave and a little bit of curl, and colored with henna. I only want to touch my hair once a day, not have to keep running to the bathroom for brushing/hairspray/check ups. This lasts all day for me. I use this product in two basic ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, when I&#x27;ve just towel dried my hair. Spray 6 to 8 squirts in my hair, style it, let air dry and don&#x27;t brush it again. (I think the air dry and don&#x27;t brush again parts are critical to getting soft curls with no frizz.) I can finger fluff it, but once my hair is dry, no more brushing. I&#x27;ve also been known to put my hair in curlers, spray several squirts over each section, let air dry, and then unroll. Again, I don&#x27;t brush it and I have great curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I mostly use it is as a hair spray. After my hair is dried, I brush it, style it, shake the bottle and then use 4 squirts (one on top, one for each side, one for the back) as hairspray. It lasts all day (indoors) with my fine hair. (I&#x27;m gradually switching to the Curly Girl method, so I will be using my brush less and less as time goes on and finger brushing more and more.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really smell the lavender. Your mileage may vary. I *love* the fact that it has so few ingredients, and that it is sulfate, paraben, and silicone free.</li>
    <li> awesome for just off the beach look. smells good. lavender is calming and it lasts for a long time. yay!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this spray and the &#x27;beachy&#x27; look it gives my hair. Definitely worth trying - fun to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this stuff! It does a great job of adding texture to my thin hair too! I haven&#x27;t tried it in wet hair yet but I usually dry my hair, then spray and scrunch. It leaves a nice effect.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair and it has been difficult for me to find a spray that would give me the waves I wanted and still not make my hair feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender gives the perfect balance of holding waves and moisture my hair needs.  My hair is still touchable (not crunchy).</li>
    <li> What a pleasant product. No dangerous chemicals. Great ingredients and goes on hair very smooth and cant even tell it is there :) I am a repeat buyer .</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a decent product. I have healthy and shiny hair, however, John Masters Organic Sea Mist takes out the shine. It literally makes my hair feel like I&#x27;ve spend a day at the beach. I&#x27;m not sure it adds to the waves, but it does act like a hairspray on my hair for some reason. I&#x27;ve tried using a tiny bit of Morrocan Oil before spritzing this product in and the results seem OK.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good and works good. Makes by hair very beachy and I really enjoy using it. Definitely should try it</li>
    <li> This stuff is fun, and smells a little too powerful. I don&#x27;t notice any difference upon applying. I smell some salt, but the lavender smell is overwhelming. I have to run throughout the house as I spray to get away from the smell lol haha. It&#x27;s fun to spray on to think your hair will be softer but I really can&#x27;t tell. Great idea though.</li>
    <li> Salty air is great for creating volume and bounce in your hair.  This sea salt spray has just that effect.  The lavender oil that is also present in the spray keeps your hair from drying out from the salt, while also leaving your hair lightly fragrant.  And it&#x27;s also organic... what could be better than that!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product until I learned how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Male, hair is 3 ish inches.  Only takes three squirts and then you need to rub it into your hair so it dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once dry your hair will stay how you put it but looks normal and is very flexible (would blow in the wind)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect alternative to gel and keeps the hair light.</li>
    <li> Living in a humid climate (Houston, TX) I have to say this stuff is great. I can have slightly damp hair, spray this on and twist it up in a bun. I head out the door, drop kids off at school, go to work, get settled in and in about 2 hours, I&#x27;ll let the twist out. I&#x27;ll shake the curls and gently scrunch my hair to get it to fall how I want it and my hair has perfect beach waves that stay. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy, it doesn&#x27;t look wet, and I don&#x27;t get the frizzies like I used to. If I want to add volume throughout the day, I&#x27;ll get my hands slightly damp and scrunch my hair again. I also discovered that if I put this on my hair and dry it straight and then use a hair straightener, my hair is incredibly soft and stays straight and doesn&#x27;t poof. Either approach, wavy or straight, I can go two days without washing my hair and it looks great. Added bonus, my husband tried it and he wants a bottle for himself. He has shorter hair but this adds the right amount of texture without the gel / hard hair look or the sticky / paste look. I also love that there are minimal ingredients that are safe for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> So, on one hand: this stuff works. I get a haircut, take a shower, spray this stuff on my head, and blowdry while combing my fingers through my hair. With a little wax, I have a pretty low maintenance quiff that actually gets compliments from strangers. The volume in my hair will stay all day and I don&#x27;t have to do any heavy-duty pomade-ing to make it happen. The texture of my hair stays pretty natural, if a little dry, so I don&#x27;t worry about dates touching my hair the way I would if I used a heavier grease or mousse or something. The spray doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals. I like the neutral, classy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand: the ingredients made me furious when I first saw them. This is a crazily expensive bottle of 1. water 2. sea salt and 3. organic lavender oil. I actually have all those things in my house and could have just bought an empty spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: I kept the bottle, but won&#x27;t buy this product again. If you love natural/organic things, are comfortable spending a lot on hair products, and don&#x27;t like DIY anything, maybe you&#x27;ll love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product...definitely accomplishes that beach look in a very natural CHEMICAL FREE way which is important to maintaining healthy hair</li>
    <li> YEAH!  Finally something that works on my long, thick, course hair and it even made my hair feel good!  I am so looking forward to using this product all summer long!!</li>
    <li> My hair looks fantastic when on vacation at the beach.  I have gorgeous, soft, bouncy curls without effort.  When I return home I am unable to recreate the look even with &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; products.  John Masters Organics Sea Mist FINALLY gives me the beach hair I love!  My curls are soft and natural looking and not stiff or crunchy.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery time. Product made my bleached hair a little dry and dull, but overall held my waves. Lavender smell was very nice.</li>
    <li> Good product. It makes my hair soft. Sometimes it makes my hair oily, but that may be because I am not using it right.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair with beachy waves as promised.  It does also leave a little residue, so I don&#x27;t like to use it every day.  Great for a casual look on the weekends though!</li>
    <li> Had originally tried B&amp;B but I had a difficult time with the added fragrance.  On my search for a replacement I found John Masters.  This is a great spray with a wonderful lavendar (my favorite) scent.  It does well on wet hair to add some texture.</li>
    <li> Definitely keeps the curl, smell is not that great but you get used to it. Waiting for the hot humid weather to see how well it really works.</li>
