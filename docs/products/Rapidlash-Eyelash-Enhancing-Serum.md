      <li>and I have been happy with those product.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used LiLash and loved it.</li>

      <li>and I just love it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!!!!!.</li>
      <li>I have to say ive been using this stuff for 6wks and its amazing.</li>
      <li>I heard about this product from a co-worker who has amazing eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for about a month, and can honestly say it works.</li>
      <li>and I told her that her eyes looked just spectacular</li>
      <li>I guess if you have good lashes, you may not understand how wonderful it is to finally have a nice set.</li>
      <li>I saw a huge improvement in the length of my lashes in two weeks!</li>
      <li>I love Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash for more than 3 months now.</li>
      <li>They are not darker but i have twice as many eyelashes now</li>
      <li>I am so glad it is affortable again.</li>
      <li>If only they could make this add volume, it would be PERFECT, but it does lengthen your lashes, it just takes a while :)</li>
      <li>So much better than laying for 1 hr and paying for lashes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rapidlash claims it takes four weeks to see results, but many folks see noticeable growth within a week.</li>
      <li>The reason being it contains significantly more</li>
      <li>So to make sure the product was safe</li>
      <li>I have also noticed that I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my lashes since I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash and my family has noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>An exquisite blue that shimmer like jewels.</li>
      <li>but they seem to be more stronger.  </li>
      <li>The color is still kind of light, but I do have more lashes, and they curl now, and are longer.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more...</li>
      <li>It works and for the money can&#x27;t find a better product.</li>
      <li>My daughter bought neu lash and her lashes were touching her brows in just three weeks.  </li>
      <li>just seems to be more of them during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I needed something to repair my lashes, so I read many reviews and did A LOT of research on lash serum and decided to try out Rapid Lash.  </li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>Many of my eye lashes fell out or were pulled out after I a stint with eyelash extensions.</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon is the best you&#x27;ll find and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>So far, this seems a great combo since I believe the Rapidlash delivers more on length while the Select Lash helps with volume.</li>
      <li>And best of all, they are ooh la la long!!  </li>
      <li>this is great and Natural</li>
      <li>I have used other brands but this seems to work the best!!!!</li>
      <li>Best $30 I ever spent on a beauty product!</li>
      <li>The orange gel is easy to apply with the included eyeliner style brush.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to apply and had no discernabile aroma or side effects.</li>
      <li>Rapid Lash has been hands down the BEST for me.</li>
      <li>I suggested it to my friend who also had great results and has requested her local Ulta store to stock it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like to spend that much money on a product when I don&#x27;t know what kind of results I can expect.</li>
      <li>AND i got free shipping.  </li>
      <li>When you consider the results, it is a great deal, and ONE tube lasted me for an entire year...</li>
      <li>Now I put on some mascara and my lashes look LONG and beautiful.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been in Advertising for 35 years and research is a significant part of what I do.</li>
      <li>It was also nice because it prevented my lashes from falling out from normal &#x27;wear and tear.&#x27;</li>
      <li>In 8 weeks I had significantly longer, thicker lashes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gives me significantly longer, thicker lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product for real.</li>
      <li>This is true.  </li>
      <li>Just be patient and consistent and I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll see some positive changes :-)</li>
      <li>Rapidlash sells in stores between $49.99 and $69.99 to find it on Amazon for $30 is a tremendous bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rapidlash sells in stores between $49.99 and $69.99 to find it on Amazon for $30 is a tremendous bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>AT first I was interested in purchasing SMARTLASH, but when I went to research the product the reviews where more in favor of the RAPIDLASH SERUM.</li>
      <li>Other than that, though, my results were absolutely AMAZING!</li>
      <li>This really works!!</li>
      <li>I recently purchased RAPIDLASH and the results in just 3 weeks are amazing.</li>
      <li>I think for the price it is certainly worth a shot.  </li>
      <li>our local store sells it for $50.00 and I was able to purchase it for $29.95 plus free shipping online.  </li>
      <li>I tried the highly economical Select Lash as sold here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I would rather pay a little more and see better results.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily add volume (which is what I really wanted), but it&#x27;s nice to have the length.</li>
      <li>And right after 2 more weeks (1.5 month total)</li>
      <li>However, this eyelash serum does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>the first week you get a TTTTTINY growth in your eyelashes, and THAT&#x27;S IT.</li>
      <li>Decided to try, and first, after 3-4 weeks of using every day I didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money if you long for lengthy lashes :)</li>
      <li>Both have been pretty non existent for 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life, I can see my eyelashes without mascara.</li>
      <li>It really makes a difference, or all those mascara companies would be out of business!</li>
      <li>I am aware that we have to keep using this product indefinitely but for this result I will.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting pretty discouraged about the product.  </li>
      <li>I took a break from using my waterproof mascara (which I had been using for many years); switched to using baby oil to remove my eye makeup; and bought a different brand of eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now able to wear mascara and eyeliner again, and my lashes are actually longer than I even realized without any help from eyelash enhancers.  </li>
      <li>This product really worked for me!</li>
      <li>It grows your eyelashes thicker and fuller in like three weeks if you are consistently using it.</li>
      <li>I tried many different mascaras and even fake eyelashes trying to get my healthy, beautiful lashes back.</li>
      <li>and I believe this helps keep my new lush long lashes strong and healthy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve used a couple tubes now and I can really tell it works. No side affects so I will stick with this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this product for real. I used it like a year ago when it was at this price then it went up. I am so glad it is affortable again. It grows your eyelashes thicker and fuller in like three weeks if you are consistently using it.</li>
    <li> I tried to use a lot other products for my eyelash&lt;br /&gt;and none works till I found this one, I have it and consistently&lt;br /&gt;used it,now I can see my eyelash looking great, I got&lt;br /&gt;compliments .my friend thought I was wearing mascara, and was amazed&lt;br /&gt;to see my new natural lashes. I wonder what other find can I get&lt;br /&gt;from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and I know that it works.  I stopped for a month or so when I was sick and could really tell a difference.  The price on Amazon is the best you&#x27;ll find and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a co-worker who has amazing eyelashes.  As I got older, I noticed my once thick lashes had fallen out and were not as long as they once were.  I&#x27;d say I have average to below average lashes at 54.  When I was young, my lashes would get stuck on my glasses.  So I thought I would try this product.  The 1st time i bought it at CVS for $50.00.  It worked great, but you have to keep using it.  I did notice i got about 3 months out of each tube.  The results take time to appear but they were noticeable.  The only drag is if you stop using this product, your lashes return to their original length..don&#x27;t know why but it happens.  So to get another tube of the product I found it here on Amazon for $30.00.  Big difference for a small item.  AND i got free shipping.  This product works..does what it says it will do and if you can get it for $30.00 you&#x27;ve just made $20.00.  It&#x27;s something I would buy again anyway, so why not pay much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t decide if you want to take the plunge on this product..and your lashes are thin and short, buy this, keep using it and get some great mascara (I like Buxom Lash by Bare essentials)</li>
    <li> Well I have been using it for 4 weeks almost 5 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen a drastic change on the length like others have commented. I do have noticed that they are thicker and fuller in spots were I didn&#x27;t have any. The thing with my eyelashes is that they are naturally full and thick but really short and so I really was hoping for the longer lashes effect. I gave the product 4 stars because I do see a slight length improvement but I don&#x27;t know if it just takes longer on some people. I&#x27;m hoping that by 6 weeks or more I will see the dramatic change that everyone is talking about. Can someone tell me if theirs took longer than 5 or 6 weeks? I would like to know if it is worth continuing with the product and buying a new tube???</li>
    <li> This really works!! I have used other brands but this seems to work the best!!!! My eyelashes are lookinbg so much longer</li>
    <li> I used the serum on my brows because they were thinning and, though skeptical at first, I was pleasantly surprised how well it did.  I would definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash for more than 3 months now. It took 2 months before I actually saw noticable lenthening, so you need to be patient. I didn&#x27;t even realize that it would darken my lashes until I started approaching the 3rd month of use and I can now see that my lashes are getting darker every week. I have not seen a lot of thickening but I&#x27;m still very happy with the results. I&#x27;m 62 years old so my lashes were very short, thin and gray; they were pretty much invisible without mascara. Now I put on some mascara and my lashes look LONG and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This product really worked for me! After three weeks of use I can tell a serious difference in the length and thickness of my lashes. I did notice a bit of discoloration on my eyelids but it looks like eye shadow! So it worked out for me. I love this stuff and will use forever!</li>
    <li> I recieved Rapidlash about 3 and a half weeks ago &amp; have been using it consistently. WOW! I had sad, thin, whimpy lashes before &amp; you could hardly see them unless I put mascara on. Now they are clearly visable, thick, &amp; long. When I choose to wear mascara it looks like I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes! Best $30 I ever spent on a beauty product! &lt;3</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve been using RapidLash for 4 weeks. My short tiny eye lashes are about 3 times longer and thicker! I really am amazed. I am aware that we have to keep using this product indefinitely but for this result I will. I was researching lash extensions when my permanent makeup expert recommended this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can truly say it has worked for me! I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and have tried maybe a million mascaras. Now just the store brand mascara makes my long lashes POP! Love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, Please put on Auto delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batting my lashes!!</li>
    <li> This product definitely works.  It took a little longer than the other brand I have used, but it is about $70 cheaper.  It doesn&#x27;t look like it is going to last as long, either.  I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s due to the fact that I have started applying more than usual, due to the lack of results I was seeing in the first 6 weeks.  I will go back to my other brand once this tube is gone.  I would rather pay a little more and see better results.</li>
    <li> Bought this after a coworker told me about it. I noticed a difference in 2 to 3 weeks. My lashes don&#x27;t rival fake ones, but they are noticeably fuller and slightly longer. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 weeks.  I bought it in the hopes that my \\&quot;over plucked\\&quot; eyebrows and my \\&quot;too thin\\&quot; eyelashes would improve.  My eyelashes are longer and perhaps a bit fuller, but it has not worked at all for my eyebrows.  I think for the price it is certainly worth a shot.  It is easy to apply, just once at night, and has worked (at least 1/2 way ) for me.</li>
    <li> when I was using this product, I developed an eye twitch a few weeks in.  It lasted for weeks.  I loved the lash improvement, but the twitch made me stop using it.  My understand when I bought the product was if I stopped, I would lose the fullness.  This is true.  I think it just slows the rate of lash loss.  I would not anticipate individual lashes getting thicker, or lashes being longer than usual- just seems to be more of them during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of trying again, and hoping the eye twitch was not related to the serum- but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was.  It stopped after I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl who recommended it to me used it on her eyebrows, and said it helped fill in an area with a scar.  I saw no brow improvement.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m going into week five and so far NOTHING, ZIP, NADA, ZERO new lashes.  I&#x27;m getting pretty discouraged about the product.  My daughter bought neu lash and her lashes were touching her brows in just three weeks.  I tried rapid lash (they were on sale) and I&#x27;m on week five with and NOTHING.  Very, very  disappointed. I guess I&#x27;ll have to cut my losses and go for nue lash if I really want to see results.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I&#x27;m in my early thirties and have noticed a drastic difference in my lashes the last few years. I tried many different mascaras and even fake eyelashes trying to get my healthy, beautiful lashes back. When I stumbled upon this, I was leery... I don&#x27;t like to spend that much money on a product when I don&#x27;t know what kind of results I can expect. I am SO happy I took the chance!! Within a very short period of time my lashes were fuller, longer, and just healthier looking in general. I will continue to buy this!! When you consider the results, it is a great deal, and ONE tube lasted me for an entire year... that&#x27;s when being used every single night. You have to be diligent when using, though. I notice a difference when I skip a few nights.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 49 and have ALWAYS had invisible eyelashes. In the past four years, they&#x27;ve gotten even worse, and even with mascara, they&#x27;re pretty wimpy. I had a hard time believing anything could help them, because over the years, I&#x27;ve tried a variety of lash enhancers with no success. I saw this product at a significant (90% off) reduction at my local grocer&#x27;s and decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for about a month, and can honestly say it works. For the first time in my life, I can see my eyelashes without mascara. The color is still kind of light, but I do have more lashes, and they curl now, and are longer. When I use mascara, I can really, really see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use it as directed: once a day, at night. In my impatience for long lashes, I used it twice a day for about a week, and it irritated my eyes--kind of felt dry and burned a bit...but once I went back to the directed use, that went away. I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve been using this for almost four months now. It REALLY works. I hardly use mascara anymore, and when I do, it looks like I&#x27;m wearing falsies or extensions. I LOVE this stuff! I guess if you have good lashes, you may not understand how wonderful it is to finally have a nice set. It really makes a difference, or all those mascara companies would be out of business! It also works well on eyebrows. I should&#x27;ve taken a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture but I didn&#x27;t really think this would work so I didn&#x27;t bother. Just be patient and consistent and I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll see some positive changes :-)</li>
    <li> This is my second tube of this product and I just love it! I saw a huge improvement in the length of my lashes in two weeks! Now that I have reached the desired length, I use the product about 2-3 times per week. This is a great price!</li>
    <li> Should say I read all the reviews before buying this product. Decided to try, and first, after 3-4 weeks of using every day I didn&#x27;t see any results. I read some reviews where people said that this didn&#x27;t work so I though I might be one of them. But I decided to continue until the package ends. And right after 2 more weeks (1.5 month total) I didn&#x27;t recognize myself. My lashes are unbelievably long and thick. I guess you just need to give it some time. Definetly will continue using!</li>
    <li> It actually works! So much better than laying for 1 hr and paying for lashes. I recommend to anybody who wants longer lashes.</li>
    <li> Having tried other eyelash growth enhancement serums with typical results appearing in about 2 weeks, I was concerned about this one until one month in. I didn&#x27;t see as much increase of volume as I have with other serums but the increased length was undeniable by the end of week 4. I did not experience any burning or itching with this product. The applicator is well designed making application simple and easy. Now into week 5 I have noticed my lashes appear darker than before using this serum, and it seems there is also some long awaited increased volume. The company does not claim you will see results within two weeks, rather 4 to 6 as was the case with me. The bottom line is that is does work, but be patient. In between the use of Tarte Lash Enhancer and Rapidlash I tried the highly economical Select Lash as sold here on Amazon. I was seeing results within a couple of weeks. I stopped the use of Select Lash once I began the Rapidlash so there could be no confusion as to which serum is actually working. After week 5, I began using both serums (applying the Rapidlash along the lash line as directed, while appying the Select Lash directly onto lashes). So far, this seems a great combo since I believe the Rapidlash delivers more on length while the Select Lash helps with volume. Since a tube of Select Lash can be purchased for under $2.00, I recommend trying this combo, particularly if you&#x27;ve reached a plateau with Rapidlash or other products. In summation, Rapidlash does eventually deliver on its promises just don&#x27;t become discouraged if you do not see fast results. With continued use, you should notice signifcant length, in my case, after 4 weeks of religious use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After 12 weeks of daily use, I am astounded with my results. I have enough lashes now that I need to use a brow brush or comb on my lashes prior to mascara application. My lashes are darker (almost black) and I am nearly 50 years old. Each individual lash is much thicker. And best of all, they are ooh la la long!!  A few lashes grew so long that I had to trim the tips a little. Fall out appears to be non-existant. I had tried several different lash enhancing products, most at a much higher price...Rapid Lash has been hands down the BEST for me. I still  brush the Select Lash directly on my lashes after applying the Rapid lash along the lash line and I believe this helps keep my new lush long lashes strong and healthy. Try both together and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning after I take a shower. I then I wait for it to dry before putting on my eye makeup. After 8 days, I noticed more eyelashes and a little longer. I also noticed some occasionally fall on my check. I stopped last week after I started seeing results, but I&#x27;m going to start again.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product, as well as hesitant to spend $30 on something that might not work. However, this eyelash serum does exactly what it is supposed to do. My lashes have never looked so lush. The length has increased, too. The only drawback is that the serum is a little irritating when applied. I will tolerate that, though, in order to keep these (now) beautiful lashes.</li>
    <li> Rapidlash Eyelash Enhancing Serum is a great product!!! I am 47 and noticed thinning and shortening of my lashes over time. Within a few short weeks I had thick, long, and beautiful lashes. I tried SmartLash that did nothing for me. This product is a must have for every woman.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t tell yet if this product is doing anything. At my age, 65, it might just not work? I&#x27;m also on glaucoma drops which are also supposed to fill out lashes. Didn&#x27;t help much that eye doc had to cut half of them off to remove a cyst! Anyway, jury is out. I usually find out about things from Costco.com and then go to Amazon.com to buy them for same or less and FREE shipping! I love Amazon.com. I hope the product works...should know after finishing the bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I had lost some eyelashes when I tried lash extensions. It was 1 week before my wedding so I really didn&#x27;t expect too much. But after using it for a month and with no results, I was sorry I spent the money on this product. It is applied above the lash line which is difficult to get in place and I don&#x27;t feel like it stays on. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Many of my eye lashes fell out or were pulled out after I a stint with eyelash extensions. I needed something to repair my lashes, so I read many reviews and did A LOT of research on lash serum and decided to try out Rapid Lash.  From the reviews, I knew it would take at least 4 weeks to see a difference. And within a month, my lashes not only had grown back, but they grew in fuller and extra long. Four different people asked me if I currently had lash extensions and I was proud to tell them these were my own lashes. :-) Since then, I have been using it about 3 times a week just to keep up the nourishment and growth and have had no negative side effects or results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product! Also, I&#x27;m an esthetician and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy this serum on amazon than \\&quot;whole sale\\&quot; at the skin convention show I went to recently.</li>
    <li> I bought this at CVS for $50 and the results were really great - I was so surprised!  In fact, after a couple of months, I only applied it a few nights a week until it ran out.  I suggested it to my friend who also had great results and has requested her local Ulta store to stock it.  However, I have not used it for about 6  months, and my eyelashes are so short and thin - I  guess I was just so used to them looking so lush!&lt;br /&gt;I considered trying something new, but I will stick with Rapid Lash because I know it works - and at the price, it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by this product which promised both lash and brow enhancement.  The orange gel is easy to apply with the included eyeliner style brush.  Essentialy, you spread the gel on the base of the lashes. As it supposedly works on brows , I applied it there also.  It was easy to apply and had no discernabile aroma or side effects. You are directed to use every night and warned that results might not be noticeable until six weeks after continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortuantely, after eight weeks there is absolutely no difference in my lashes.  There is the slightest growth on my brows but overall, the effects are negligible. Perhaps my lashes are as long and as thick as they will ever be.  Oh well, thank goodness for voumizing mascara and false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 3 years now, with a short break for a few months. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that if I stopped using it, then my lashes went back to their original length. Other than that, though, my results were absolutely AMAZING! My lashes grew both thicker and longer in a couple of weeks and I only need to use it once every few days to keep them that way. Well worth the money if you long for lengthy lashes :)</li>
    <li> Love it... First product i bought that acutally does what it says....would highly recommend. Tried the lash extentions they were nothing but a hassle..this is great and Natural</li>
    <li> I started using RapidLash three weeks ago and wow!  After week two my lashes appear longer and thicker.  I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Before I have used Rapid Lash with HEXATEIN 1 complex/ and I have been happy with those product. I decided to buy new one and bought PROMAXIL&#x27; one. It was not enough for 2-3 week. So I can to say that it work.</li>
    <li> Let me caveat this review by saying I never gave a hoot about my eye lashes or brows. Both have been pretty non existent for 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair started to thin I just shaved my head. But eye lashes? I could care less. My sister has a pair of the most beautiful eyes I&#x27;ve ever seen. They&#x27;re much like Elizabeth&#x27;s Taylors eyes were. An exquisite blue that shimmer like jewels. Well, we hadn&#x27;t seen each other for about a month, met for lunch and I told her that her eyes looked just spectacular but I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on why the difference was so significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She told me she was using NueLash which sells for well over a $100 per tube. I&#x27;ve been in Advertising for 35 years and research is a significant part of what I do. So to make sure the product was safe I did a little research on her behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes the lashes grow is the active ingredient  \\&quot;Isopropyl Cioprostenate -  it&#x27;s not new, it&#x27;s been used in Europe for over a decade. Out of all the eye lash enhancer&#x27;s on the market there are only three that have Isopropyl Cioprosrenate - NueLash, RevitaLash and RapidLash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others use dense moisturizers to temporarily plump up the lashes. However the above three products are the only ones that can actually grow out eye lashes and brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a blind study by Consumer Labs and an independent clinical trial sponsored by RapidLash, RapidLash performed an average of 88% better than Nuelash and RevitaLash. The reason being it contains significantly more Isopropyl Cioprostenate - 27% more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered a tube and have used it for less than two weeks. For the first time, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my eye lashes, they&#x27;re definitely a bit longer and thicker. Same for my eye brows where they were bald there&#x27;s now growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rapidlash claims it takes four weeks to see results, but many folks see noticeable growth within a week. It works for about 80% of the people who use this product so the odds are in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been no documented health hazards regarding Isopropyl Cioprostenate with the exception of a few (less than 6%) of people who had redness and a mild allergic reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether I continue to use it remains to be seen - but it does work and it does out perform the others - not to mention it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost. Rapidlash sells in stores between $49.99 and $69.99 to find it on Amazon for $30 is a tremendous bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if it only grew hair on my bald noggin.our favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been no documented health hazards regarding Isopropyl Cioprostenate with the exception of a few (less than 6%) of people who had redness and a mild allergic reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether I continue to use it remains to be seen - but it does work and it does out perform the others - not to mention it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost. Rapidlash sells in stores between $49.99 and $69.99 to find it on Amazon for $30 is a tremendous bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if it only grew hair on my bald noggin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for several years and will continue to use it.  It works well.  You have to be patient because it doesn&#x27;t work overnight.</li>
    <li> I have used this product daily for over a month now and can see a difference in the length and thickness of my lashes. My lashes were not thin or short to begin with but I have always wanted to try this stuff since I saw the ads on t.v. The directions say to put on after you take your make-up off at night before bed. I do that sometimes but half the time I am using this after I shower in the morning. I let it sit for a few minutes to soak in while drying my hair or whatever. I haven&#x27;t seen any stray eyelashes either, even when washing my face.</li>
    <li> I used this on my lashes as well as my brows everynight for 3 months.  I saw no change in length, thickness or color for lashes or brows.</li>
    <li> seriously, their tv commercial was very efficient. but the product DIDNT DO A THING for me. NOTHING. NADA. after 3 months, it went to the trash. i still swear by Revitalash, and REVITALASH ONLY.&lt;br /&gt;the other joke was SmartLash... the first week you get a TTTTTINY growth in your eyelashes, and THAT&#x27;S IT. end of the story. your lashes go back to how they were after a few days and no more growth after that, no matter how much or well you use it.&lt;br /&gt;As for Latisse GENERIC which is sold right here, it is just as useless. PLUS it made me wake up with red eyes every morning (and i usually never develop allergic reactions to products). not itchy or anything, just red inside, as if i had some allergy. it went away when i stopped it. needless to say it doesnt work at all, so dont fall for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO i am going back to Revitalash.</li>
    <li> When I initially started using this product I noticed that my eyelashes looked longer right away.  I was hooked on the product and bought it religiously for the last 2-3 years.  About 6 weeks after initially starting to use it, I noticed that all of the tiny lashes on my inner eyelids had fallen out so I went on the internet to see what could cause eyelashes to fall out.  It said that it could be due to waterproof mascara or eyeliner; or use of an eyelash curler.  I took a break from using my waterproof mascara (which I had been using for many years); switched to using baby oil to remove my eye makeup; and bought a different brand of eyelash curler.  My eyelashes finally grew back in, but for the last 2 years I&#x27;ve been continuously going through this cycle--I even switched to a non waterproof eyeliner and stopped wearing mascara altogether for a while, and I was still losing those same eyelashes.  I had eliminated virtually all waterproof eye makeup; changed my makeup remover that I had been using for about 20 years that had never caused my eyelashes to fall out before;  and I wasn&#x27;t losing hair anywhere else which finally led me to the conclusion that maybe the Rapidlash might be the cause of the eyelash loss.  I realized that my eyelashes had started falling out about 6 weeks after I started using the product, which is about how long it takes for it to take effect.  I stopped using the product about 2 months ago and my lashes have finally started growing back. I&#x27;m now able to wear mascara and eyeliner again, and my lashes are actually longer than I even realized without any help from eyelash enhancers.  I guess I had an allergic reaction to the product which actually makes sense because my skin is very sensitive.  Unfortunately it took me over 2 1/2 years to figure it out and I wasted a lot of money on the product for nothing.</li>
    <li> I have to say ive been using this stuff for 6wks and its amazing. I noticed a changed about 3wks after using it and now i have much fuller longer eyelashes. They are not darker but i have twice as many eyelashes now and they are all long. I have sensitive eyes but this doesnt bother my eyes at all. Im a fan for life!</li>
    <li> I have bought rapid lash for at least a year now from varies places. It works and for the money can&#x27;t find a better product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Until I hit age 50 I had always had long lashes. Gradually they just disappeared. This product has given me back my long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I use a magnifying mirror and apply a thin layer right where the lashes meet the eyelid.</li>
    <li> Really not happy with the quanitity I received.  It was sealed properly but when I pulled out the wand, it was practicly dry and compared it with the same item I purchased from another company. Big difference in weight and liquid content. Was this one tampered with or left out to dry?</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine and thought I would try it out. I had just removed my eyelash extensions and I literally had little nubs for eyelashes. I actually used to have long, thick eyelashes but after my pregnancy and work stress, I started to lose them and I was willing to try anything to get them back. I must say that I was pretty impressed with the results of this product. It took about 3-4 weeks before I noticed a difference, but my lashes got really long and pretty strong. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily add volume (which is what I really wanted), but it&#x27;s nice to have the length. It was also nice because it prevented my lashes from falling out from normal &#x27;wear and tear.&#x27; However, after about 3 months of using it, I noticed that it seems like the serum stopped working a bit. My lashes are still long, but it&#x27;s taking longer to regrow. I have also noticed that I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my lashes since I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash and my family has noticed a difference. If only they could make this add volume, it would be PERFECT, but it does lengthen your lashes, it just takes a while :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used LiLash and loved it. In 8 weeks I had significantly longer, thicker lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried RapidLash -- and loved it. It gives me significantly longer, thicker lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LiLash -- abut $80.  RapidLash -- under $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> AT first I was interested in purchasing SMARTLASH, but when I went to research the product the reviews where more in favor of the RAPIDLASH SERUM. I recently purchased RAPIDLASH and the results in just 3 weeks are amazing. Not only are my lashes longer and thicker but they seem to be more stronger.  I will be ordering more...our local store sells it for $50.00 and I was able to purchase it for $29.95 plus free shipping online.  Thanks Amazon!!!!!.</li>
