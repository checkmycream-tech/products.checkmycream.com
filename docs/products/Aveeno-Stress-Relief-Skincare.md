      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love lavender/chamomile scents, but don&#x27;t like the scent of this product.  </li>
      <li>I also think it dries out my skin more instead of moisturizing it.  </li>

      <li>I love the Aveeno products and have been using the hand lotion for years.</li>

      <li>Amazing product leaves your skin smelling great and super soft.</li>
      <li>it moisturizes with natural ingredients and has a great scent.  </li>
      <li>As a guy, it should be taken into account what ingredients are in the body wash instead of just picking Axe and Old Spice because they look manly and have great commercials.</li>

      <li>I have been sleeping a lot more sound as well</li>
      <li>great deal, silky soft stuff.</li>
      <li>Good to be used on a &amp;#34;treat yourself&amp;#34; basis so that it doesn&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
      <li>It seems like a product that would be great for a specific audience--those with drier skin, better drains, and an aversion to lavender--</li>
      <li>The bottle is easy to hold on to in the shower too and is recyclable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love the smell,and it is soft and moisture</li>
    <li> Wonderful product--I keep it it stock all the time.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. Smells and feels great, and is by Aveeno, so has more natural ingredients.    Was travelling with a girlfriend, who uses top-of-the-line everything. I left this on the bathtub and she used it. She raved about how great it was and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and get her some.    So, there you go! Two opinions in one review.</li>
    <li> Order this regularly.</li>
    <li> Lavender smell good, used feel soothing</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for years. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here on Amazon, they have a great price!</li>
    <li> I found out about this body wash from researching natural products on the EWG website.  I gave it a try, and love it.  Nice smell, works well.  I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> My wife gets very itchy skin and she loves this body wash. It&#x27;s thick and creamy and moisturizing without being greasy. It smells wonderful and calming. Would be great in a warm &amp;#34;before bedtime&amp;#34; bath.</li>
    <li> I love the Aveeno products and have been using the hand lotion for years. This is very creamy so don&#x27;t expect tons of suds when you use it but it has a great scent and helps me calm down at the end of the day. Leaves my skin very soft and clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno products for my dry skin.  I may try somethhing else, but I always go back to Aveeno.</li>
    <li> This is a delightful product, albeit a little expensive for a daily shower regimen.  Good to be used on a &amp;#34;treat yourself&amp;#34; basis so that it doesn&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
    <li> The product name \\&quot;Stress Relief Body Wash\\&quot; says it all. This wonderful product, put out by Aveeno, does the job. Made with wonderful ingredients, like lavender, chamomile and ylang-ylang, you feel the stress of the day melt off of your body. Its special soap free formula gets the job done, in addition to the wonderful addition of oatmeal, as a base. It smells heavenly, without being tacky or overly perfumed. Please use this if you need a lift, or, simply a release from day-to-day pressure. This is good as a companion item to any shower in America......</li>
    <li> I have never tried any bath product that I enjoy more ... very refreshing &amp; relaxing.  The aroma of lavendar is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have difficulty finding this in stock in town even though I looked at the grocery stores and others that carry bath products. No luck. Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
    <li> on time this is an excellent product does not dry out my skin like other products</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by another Nordic type guy with sensitive skin issues. I have been using every kind of antimicrobial or hydrocortisone cream I could find to clear up red blemish patches on my face and body. After using it about 3X my skin is clear! Nice smell too.</li>
    <li> Great for babies!!!!  (toddler now)&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know that the standard Aveeno was soap free like the baby Aveeno......which costs more!  I like the smell of this one better than the baby Calming body wash.  We have this on Subscribe and Save.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it does not dry out my skin like other brands  I pair it up after my shower with the lotion. Love it.</li>
    <li> I was sad to get the notification that this product wouldn&#x27;t be available through the subscription any more. I enjoy this body wash. The scent soothes me for a good night&#x27;s rest!</li>
    <li> The lavender scent is strong without being overpowering, and won&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your skin like some body washes tend to. Good complement if you already use Aveeno body products; good stand-alone if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001E96L7C Aveeno Active Naturals Fragrance Free Skin Relief Body Wash, 18-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]  I live on Aveeno I use all of the products they make from skin care to makeup. I love Aveeno!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Hy-Vee one day because I opened it and it smelled great.  I carry a lot of stress and when I get out of the shower after using this it seems to work.  My girlfriend says my skin is really soft for a guy as well.  Oh yeah, I&#x27;m a guy.  :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for relaxing. Have been buying for years.</li>
    <li> the best body wash....</li>
    <li> This body wash is very relaxing in the shower after a long day. I have been sleeping a lot more sound as well</li>
    <li> We have very hard water.  It is difficult to find a body wash that does not further dry out the skin than what is already happening in the hard water, but the Aveeno Active Naturals Stress Relief Body Wash helps to keep my skin moisturized, soft, and with the lavender, chamomile and ylang ylang, the scent is very pleasant.  I use it in the morning as a preventative to the daily stress in my life!!! (Here&#x27;s hoping anyway.)</li>
    <li> I itched like crazy when I used this. I only used it once and for the rest of the day my skin was itchy. I tried putting lotion on my skin to help, but it didn&#x27;t. It does have a nice, soothing scent, but I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I like this product alot</li>
    <li> Makes me feel so relaxed and taken care of! This body wash is made up of natural ingredients and is non toxic. Besides that it smells wonderful. Someone originally got this Aveeno lavender body wash for me when I was pregnant and it really helped me get through pregnancy. Showers were therapeutic and the lavender smell made me feel good and helped with my nausea. I just bought the 3 pack which will last me a long time now.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite things to come home to after a long and stressful day. The smell is just so relaxing, it makes all the unhappy stuff from my bad days just wash away. Also, is a great body wash that leaves my skin feeling great &amp; not dried out. I have VERY dry skin so this is a great thing. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great relaxing body wash.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried several body washes and soaps that have caused me to become itchy, dry, and break out (Dove... I&#x27;m talking to you) I tried this body wash after another fit of trying Dove sensitive skin body wash. Aveeno was on the shelves that day and I decided to try it, so I thought why not?&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I used it as directed and I came out of the shower feeling relief and not the normal itch I tend to get once my skin dries off (especially in my arms). It actually felt soothing and comforting. My red patches on my arms started to disappear within a week of use (due to my past body wash). I love the smell!! This was also the only body wash I could withstand while I was pregnant. It&#x27;s just that soothing. If they ever stop making this I&#x27;ll cry and so will my skin.</li>
    <li> I love lavender/chamomile scents, but don&#x27;t like the scent of this product.  Poor suds/foam. I also think it dries out my skin more instead of moisturizing it.  Will not buy again--waste of money!</li>
    <li> After using this for 6 months via the Subscribe and Save program, there is a noticeable difference in the health of my skin.  Previously, it was so dry that I wondered whether I should wash with lotion instead of body wash ;)  Now, it is a lot closer to normal. I&#x27;m hoping to see continued improvement.</li>
    <li> Love this shower gel. Very modest scent, smooth on skin, and the bottle lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> This product smells so awful.  Like really repulsive.</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever tried that smells like A1 steak sauce.</li>
    <li> I am not totally sure about the stress relief part of it, but I know this is one of the best body washes I have ever used. The fragrance, smoothness etc. are never felt before with other products. I will continue to buy and use this product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love the fresh smell. The bottle is easy to hold on to in the shower too and is recyclable.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Amazing product leaves your skin smelling great and super soft. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> my favorite body wash!</li>
    <li> it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin all the time and this is great for it.  it moisturizes with natural ingredients and has a great scent.  As a guy, it should be taken into account what ingredients are in the body wash instead of just picking Axe and Old Spice because they look manly and have great commercials.</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Relaxing smell. Best liquid soap I have found so far. Will continue to buy. Love the smell! Gentle on skin, but works well.</li>
    <li> This product works as it says leaving skin so smooth and soft.  The smell is also soothing and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> skin feel soft and smell good!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used. It leaves the skin feeling clean, moisturized and includes a wonderful scent.  Great service.</li>
    <li> I was particularly put off by the scum this would leave on my bathtub, but maybe if you have a great drain that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. I never really felt clean after using this body wash, either, like it left a film of scum on ME. The scent was ok--I like a clean lavender smell, which I was hoping for, but it&#x27;s cut by the ylang-ylang to the point of nonrecognition. I think those who don&#x27;t like a strong lavender scent may appreciate that. It seems like a product that would be great for a specific audience--those with drier skin, better drains, and an aversion to lavender--but obviously I&#x27;m not that audience.</li>
    <li> This body wash is awesome. Skin feels so good afterwards and smell lingers after shower. I love all aveno products!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my wife as a Christmas stocking stuffer.  This is her favorite Aveeno soap.  She highly recommends this product.</li>
    <li> This body wash is the best I have ever used, and thats a lot.  It softens the skin and cleans thoroughly. Try it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I was using an EXPENSIVE body wash from WF and needed a less costly option. Aveeno Active Naturals did the job and more... Great scent and full lather.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for people with dry itchy skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and find it to be the best first-line offense against dry skin and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling body wash. Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> The flavors sounded wonderful to me, but I have to say that it is nearly scentless. I don&#x27;t even smell the lavender... it&#x27;s just a slightly fragrant body wash.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife but now use it and love it!!  My dry skin is completely gone and am enjoying that fact.</li>
    <li> Love the mild lavender fragrance, does not dry up your skin. What else can I ask for in a body wash :-)</li>
    <li> A go-to body wash, really de-stressing. I look for this on sale at pharmacies, but also recommend it from Amazon. Feel super clean after using Aveeno Lavender.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. Its great for baby sensative skin plus smells so good!!! Great product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it relieves my stress but I do look forward to using it every night after work so that is a plus! this is smooth and creamy and lasts a decent amount of time when used with a loofah!</li>
    <li> A teaspoonful does a whole shower and leaves the bathroom smelling like the day spa! Doesn&#x27;t dry skin and makes your shower a relaxing experience even if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good on feeling,smelling, and cleaning.</li>
    <li> product arrived on time and its as good as expected.  may be order some more when i am done with this pack.</li>
    <li> I adore Aveeno, makes my skin so soft and smells SO good!</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. I&#x27;m not sure it actually relieves stress or not, but it does smell nice and is not overpowering. It makes for a good bath as well.</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smells!  It is also less expensive here bundled like this than I am able to find locally.  I appreciate it when Amazon keeps prices low on quality products like Aveeno.</li>
    <li> The Calming Aveeno wash smells slightly better... This is what I wrote about the Calming version \\&quot;Best smelling body wash! It is calming, helps me sleep, AND feels AMAZING!!!! Best body wash ever!!! It&#x27;s so gentle, I even use it on my babies!\\&quot;. All goes for this wash as well, but it definitely is second place to the Calming Aveeno wash.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll love how this body wash pampers your skin. This product does not contain soap or dye, so it&#x27;s safe to use on sensitive skin. Bubbles have a delightful scent making for an enjoyable, refreshing bathing experience.</li>
    <li> Love this body wash!  As soon as you get in the tub you can feel the soothing effect of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> My favorite. I will buy this over and over and over again. It makes my skin so incredibly soft, and I just want to fall asleep in the shower from the aroma. Which is amazing. A little difficult to wash off, but not an issue at all.</li>
    <li> This body wash is a wonderful product.  It has the natural fragrance of lavender, cleans as well as moisturizes, and is silky to the touch.  I have used this during the harsh winter months for the past couple years, and will continue using it during this time period for years to come.</li>
    <li> i love this product...it really does make my very dry skin feel good...</li>
    <li> This is my stress relief before bed. It helps me manage crying baby at night better, with more patience. Although I feel that it is not exactly same as the travel size one that came with the baby products gift pack.</li>
    <li> I love this line of products. I bought this because it was the same scent as one of the other soap products. But, this one is the stress relief formula and the consistency is different. It&#x27;s more gloppy. The other liquid formula is more fluid and doesn&#x27;t sit on my hand in a glop that often runs off my hand in one big dollop of soap down the drain. I will be buying the other formula, AVEENO POSITIVELY NOURISHING AVEENO CALMING BODY WASH.</li>
    <li> great deal, silky soft stuff. gets my washcloth a little mushy, though, so you may want to use a poof instead.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on skin and smells wonderful. It actually does feel like it&#x27;s relieving stress, as advertised. I can&#x27;t wait to use it whenever I get in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I have been using this particular wash for many years and have never thought of switching to anything else. It smells great and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Aveeno bath products are amazing.  They leave your skin soft and smelling wonderful.  This Lavender mix will help sooth you while in the shower or in the tub.  We have hard water but when using this, I don&#x27;t have to put on lotion!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend and she loves it.  Great buy from Amazon as usual!</li>
    <li> Luxurious, in smell and feel. My favorite body wash of all time. You can&#x27;t feel stressed or be in a bad mood taking a shower with these. I always shower in the evening and this is perfect for unwinding from the day. Skin feels very soft and moisturized (but not too much) with this. I use a scrub/exfoliating towel with this.</li>
    <li> Delicate fragrance that relieves stress while cleaning body thoroughly without leaving that residue feeling on your skin after rinsing.</li>
