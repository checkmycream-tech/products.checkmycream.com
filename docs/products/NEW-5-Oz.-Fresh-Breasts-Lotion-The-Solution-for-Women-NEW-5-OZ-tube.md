    <li> I hate to admit that I have breast sweat but this lotion works!  I no longer am embarrassed working out walking around with sweat marks showing through my shirt.  This summer I feel confident I will be dry without sweat marks showing through my tops..</li>

    <li> This product is a god send. It works well under my breast and in my bikini area. It does stain a little bit but if your that lazy to wash your undergarments frequently then that&#x27;s your own problem.</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst product ever. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This product works really well. It will of course get the under part of your bra full of white stuff, but it&#x27;s totally worth it to not have the dreaded under-boob sweat... The only thing I regret about the purchase is that I didn&#x27;t know about this stuff a LONG time ago!</li>
