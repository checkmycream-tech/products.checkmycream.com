<li> They look natural and it is true that the glue is weird</li>
<li> They last long if you take care of them!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy them!</li>
<li> They are very long however</li>
<li> but they were empty, so that&#x27;s a downside.</li>
<li> Oh yeah the glue did not really work..</li>
<li> Received on expected arrival date.</li>
<li> well spend the $2 you spent on this and buy ONE pair from Walmart or Target.</li>
<li> They are just a little too long, the length.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t see why there needs to have any &amp;#34;lash glue&amp;#34; with it when ALL OF THEM ARE EMPTY IN EACH CASE OF LASHES!.</li>
<li> They aren&#x27;t as long as they are pictured, they have an odd odor, and rip as soon as you take them out of the box!</li>
<li> Other than that, thumbs up!</li>
<li> but I could care less about that cus</li>
<li> Well I opened mine today and the little glue containers were in there</li>
<li> it was dried out</li>
<li> A little stiff in the beginning</li>
<li> but since i dont usually use the glues that eyelashes come with, i didnt mind at all</li>
<li> and there was NOTHING inside, what a waste of time of them to even make those and put them in there!</li>
<li> I bought these, and not only received the wrong lashes..but none of the glue worked.</li>
<li> the band is really thick and the eyelashes feel like thin plastic, don&#x27;t use the glue that comes with them because either they dried out while packaged, their empty, or they don&#x27;t stick at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
<li> The lashes and really fake looking, even after cutting them to size, they still aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
<li> When I first saw these, I was very afraid that these would look extremely fake.</li>
<li> The lash line band is very thick and the lashes itself are very thin.</li>
<li> So I was a little disappointed.</li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> HORRIBLE!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was very satisfied with these false eyelashes! I adore the eyelash style. It comes with adhesive for every pair, but I reccomend that you buy a different adhesive and not use the one they give you. I tried using the adhesive but it would not stick to my eye! D: But, the glue doesn&#x27;t really matter too much. The packaging is very nice and the delivery was swift!  I have monolids, so these do work for monolids for anyone curious. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> The band is a little thick, but they are great length and look beautiful.</li>
    <li> great fit, really light share with friend and she will be ordering some for herself</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE! I would put no stars if I could. These are plastic! I am an avid buyer and wearer of eyelashes and these are such a waste! You might s well spend the $2 you spent on this and buy ONE pair from Walmart or Target. They&#x27;ll last wayyyyyyy longer and be worth your money. They aren&#x27;t as long as they are pictured, they have an odd odor, and rip as soon as you take them out of the box! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> These lashes are short which makes them look real, I love them ordered 2 more pks. the glue is not useable but who cares the lashes are great.</li>
    <li> These are so nice! very natural cross style lashes, and so cheap! but warning, it comes with a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; glue LOL that actually had me laughing when i kept cutting the glue container and there was NOTHING inside, what a waste of time of them to even make those and put them in there! but since i dont usually use the glues that eyelashes come with, i didnt mind at all :) if you guys are looking for a good affordable eyelash glue, try Darkness eyelash glue; its pretty darn good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT::&lt;br /&gt;I brought these lashes again since i was very satisfied, but i was surprised that they send me a set of eyelash glue! THANKS!</li>
    <li> these are the best lashes and the price is great ..............you can cut them to fit your eye perfect.....love them</li>
    <li> I love them! They are just a little too long, the length. Other than that I love love love them!! I would so buy more! I just have to have time to cut the length a lot..I dont really like them too long. So yeah(: I bought this like on the 7th of September and I&#x27;m still using only 1 out of 10. They last long if you take care of them!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy them! Oh yeah the glue did not really work..it was dried out but I could care less about that cus I rather get the one I use.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the price just to try and was totally amzed at how easy they applied ... the glue that came with the product was dried out but that ok  i used DUo eyelash glue instead anywyas ... they stayed on all day and i reused them ... treat em nice and u can reuse if u like ... i will buy more soon  great for everyday use.  thanks</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering from this person and everytime was a great experience. they eyelashes are good quality</li>
    <li> The eyelashes came with NO glue. There were glue containers but they were empty, so that&#x27;s a downside. The eyelashes themselves are pretty good for something so cheap. They are very long however so you might have to trim them yourself. Other than that, thumbs up!</li>
    <li> these are okay eyelashes the band is really thick and the eyelashes feel like thin plastic, don&#x27;t use the glue that comes with them because either they dried out while packaged, their empty, or they don&#x27;t stick at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can try them maybe you have a different preference, but I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like these. They look natural and it is true that the glue is weird but I never use the glue that comes with it anyways. But hair glue always seems to do the trick its easier, cleans up easy and it makes the eyelashes reusable if your like me and take them off before you go to sleep</li>
    <li> Ok I received my lashes today n they&#x27;re suppose to come with their own glue. Well I opened mine today and the little glue containers were in there but there was no glue inside lol. I had to go buy my own. So I was a little disappointed. I know they&#x27;re cheap n all but don&#x27;t say they have glue if they ain&#x27;t gonna have glue especially putting glue containers with no glue in them.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product. VERY CHEAP. I don&#x27;t see why there needs to have any &amp;#34;lash glue&amp;#34; with it when ALL OF THEM ARE EMPTY IN EACH CASE OF LASHES!. it is also very easy to damage the ash when you take them off. how ever, this is a natural looking crisscross lash!</li>
    <li> When I first saw these, I was very afraid that these would look extremely fake. However, they look okay on. They glam up your eyes and it actually looks tolerable if you want natural lashes on. In my opinion they are really pretty. Now the quality of these lashes are okay. The lash line band is very thick and the lashes itself are very thin. Overall, I am pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes. Easy to apply . Would purchase these a again. Received on expected arrival date. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes for 40 years and although I love Ardell and others they are just getting too expensive. You can&#x27;t beat the price of these and I like them alot. A little stiff in the beginning but they loosen up. Just make sure that you buy seperate glue</li>
    <li> By far my favorite and go-to lashes!! They are long, voluminous, but not too over the top. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments when wearing these, people think they look so natural! They are very sturdy and made of good quality. A pair will literally last you 10 uses, maybe even more if you take care of them!</li>
    <li> The lashes were as described but they were labeled MAC. They do a good job when i cut them to shape. The band is thicker than I would have liked but I do use liquid liner to cover any mishaps.</li>
    <li> I bought these, and not only received the wrong lashes..but none of the glue worked. I contacted customer service, who btw were very friendly, and they promptly sent me a new package...with the exact same things wrong with it. The lashes and really fake looking, even after cutting them to size, they still aren&#x27;t worth it. Sorry.</li>
