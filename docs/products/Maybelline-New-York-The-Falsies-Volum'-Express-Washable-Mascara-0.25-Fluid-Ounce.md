      <li>It&#x27;s da BOMB! :D</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras looking for the perfect match for my average-volume, longer-length lashes.</li>
      <li>The Falsies is an excellent mascara that both darkens and lengthens the appearance of my lashes.</li>
      <li>This adds length and volumizes my eyelashes the perfect amount without clumping.</li>
      <li>For me it works great!</li>
      <li>really impressed.  </li>
      <li>Best in the world!</li>
      <li>This is probably the best mascara I&#x27;ve used for volumizing.</li>
      <li>The best mascaras are sleek and mend the tip of lashes to points in order to look longer.  </li>
      <li>no, but it&#x27;s great for what it is!</li>

      <li>That&#x27;s saying something considering men don&#x27;t notice drastic changes like hair color!  &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I use this all the time as it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes, most do within an hour or two.</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite got it fast too and price great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras and it&#x27;s definitely the best.</li>
      <li>I would rather spend more if that is what I need to do to get something I like and can use.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m glad that I did..</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara.....</li>
      <li>It works much better when used on top of another.</li>
      <li>She got me started on this, and I love it.</li>
      <li>OK mascara.</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara, love the curved brush.  </li>
      <li>Goes on very nice, looks very nices</li>
      <li>Really cool!</li>
      <li>hope everyone buys this because I would be lost if they discontinue the product.&lt;br /&gt;Washes off easy with water and a bit of soap.</li>
      <li>Crumbles under the lashes if you don&#x27;t take it off at night but washes off easily in the morning.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to remove but has that waterproof effect.</li>
      <li>Everything is good..except, this mascara smears too easily.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of maybelline mascaras, and the original falsies is one of my all time favorite</li>
      <li>As someone that grew up with Mabelline Great Lash mascara,  I was looking forward to trying this incarnation from the same company.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and hasn&#x27;t started clumping yet.</li>
      <li>I really liked this mascara, the curved applicator really helps.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better than my higher brand mascara</li>
      <li>It takes some skill to apply so give it a week to get used to, as it has a unique consistency.</li>
      <li>so I was really excited to try this one...</li>
      <li>BACK TO THAT OLD STANDBY, GREAT LASH BY MAYBELLINE!!!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this mascara</li>
      <li>have avg length lashes, not too full.  </li>
      <li>, it does build up skimpy lashes, but if you have full lashes, this mascara will clump like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>I mean no product is going to work great for everyone!..</li>
      <li>I bought this product and it was fine for the first 10 uses.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>I either use Maybelline&#x27;s Collossol or Volume Plush as my main mascara or primer when I add this one on top.</li>
      <li>Do I like it better than my normal stuff?</li>
      <li>If I bought a new &#x27;fresh&#x27; one this product would have been better.</li>
      <li>I dont believe that this product was worth the hype that a bunch of youtubers give it.</li>
      <li>The color is good and what I expected however it clumps</li>
      <li>Not the best mascara I have ever worn but not the worse.</li>
      <li>I have used The Falsies mascara before in other colors and absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>i recently bought million lashes and i love that better by far.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this in the past, and it worked great...</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely for long lashes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I want my mascara  thinner with this, and it does</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely for long lashes.  Crumbles under the lashes if you don&#x27;t take it off at night but washes off easily in the morning.</li>
    <li> The mascara is very clumpy which makes it very hard and messy to apply. I can see the clumps as I pull the wand out of the tube. I added a tiny bit of contact lens solution to thin it out and it seems ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen good and bad reviews on this mascara and I was skeptical about purchasing it...But I&#x27;m glad that I did..I mean no product is going to work great for everyone!..So you really have to try it out yourself and see how it works on you as an individual...For me it works great! It gives my lashes length and volume without looking clumpy! I was seriously considering trying false eyelashes but now after using this...I don&#x27;t see a need to!:) Glad I took a chance on this mascara!!!</li>
    <li> For the price and product I give this a 5 star.  I normally buy professional quality mascara and this is pretty decent.  For a drug store brand mascara it&#x27;s definitely a 5.  Do I like it better than my normal stuff? no, but it&#x27;s great for what it is! Goes on smoothly and hasn&#x27;t started clumping yet.</li>
    <li> I only wear mascara and blush and face powder I do not like lot of make up but, I love my eyes to look full and long and this stuff I was kind of scared to leave loreal but, this is stuff  is just ok it looked good for a couple of days then started to clump</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16 and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara! Best in the world! My lashes look AMAZING! When I mean amazing, I mean it! It never clumps and never fails. It&#x27;s even better than my higher brand mascara (Lancome Paris Defining Mascara). Well, I can say good~bye to buying that expensive stuff :P . This is a total must have! The delivery was super quick and came 3 days early! I will continue to buy this from now on! MAYBELLINE RULES!\\&quot; &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> They have all these fibers that make lashes look longer and look great if you are going out at night but for working or for long hours they too get too clumpy and hard to wash off</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have used to date.  Last all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mabelline mascara all my life.  I noticed occasional flaking with they &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; stuff, but nothing like with this.  A total waste of money because I won&#x27;t use it again.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> I had hopes but so much mascara comes out on the brush that it makes a huge mess. If you try to apply it withiout wiping off the excess from the brush, you end up with clumps on your lashes. But it&#x27;s an unnecessary pain to have to carefully wipe the brush every time you use it. Also not easy to wash off with soap and water- leaves raccoon eyes that require an oily make-up remover to get rid of. Makes the expensive mascaras seem so worth it to not have either of these problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it was fine for the first 10 uses. It made my lashes long and i loved it. But after a while it flakes off into your eyes and it like having sand in your eyes. It also starts to clump real bad after a while. I&#x27;m so disappointed because i loved the effect it had on my eyelashes but i don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;s gonna flake into my eyes.</li>
    <li> $5 for a super great mascara, you cannot go wrong.  I want super long full lashes and this does it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Mabeline Stelleto (uck), impossible lengths (uck), great lash (not long), Lancome definitional (nice but not too long), doll lash, clinique, EstaLauder.....none did such a good job of lengthing my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;The tube does not last as long as some, I guess it is because you use a lot to get the length.&lt;br /&gt;I have no problems with clumps until it starts to get old.  Plan on 2 months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;I have avg length lashes, not too full.  I wear this every day.&lt;br /&gt;I hope everyone buys this because I would be lost if they discontinue the product.&lt;br /&gt;Washes off easy with water and a bit of soap.</li>
    <li> Not the best mascara I have ever worn but not the worse. Certainly, it does not make lashes look as full as false ones would (as the name suggests). I will try a different mascara next time.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best mascara I&#x27;ve used for volumizing. It really sticks to its claims. I definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s da BOMB! :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated my eyelashes and I really hate putting on fake eyelashes.  I end up messing them up and they bother me.  I tried this mascara and now I love my eyelashes!  This really does add length and even my boyfriend noticed!  That&#x27;s saying something considering men don&#x27;t notice drastic changes like hair color!  &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;After speaking with some friends I am trying out their two other types - the waterproof falsies in Very Black (doesn&#x27;t have the lace on the front cover &amp; has blue-ish writing instead of the black as she said that is less clumpy and I will be trying out the new &#x27;flared&#x27; falsies with the wings on it as neither of us have tried that one yet.  I would suggest the black drama for a more dramatic look and the Very Black for a more natural look.</li>
    <li> This item took to long to get home but the product itself does of very nice job for length and thickness with one application my eyelashes looked way different (: I would recommend this product (:</li>
    <li> I use this on top of my regular mascara when I want a more dramatic look. I either use Maybelline&#x27;s Collossol or Volume Plush as my main mascara or primer when I add this one on top. This gives extreme length and nice volume, although both mascaras that I use as a base give better volume boosting results. I don&#x27;t like using this alone because it is heavy and clumps my sparse lashes together. It works much better when used on top of another. I love using it on my outer lashes and it does give that false lash look, without the falseness. &#x3D;D That&#x27;s the best I can describe it. I always keep a tube of this handy.</li>
    <li> Great mascara. Makes it look like I have falsies! ;)</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara..... Hands Down!</li>
    <li> I like what the mascara does, but it&#x27;s not water proof. It makes under my eyes look dark. Very hard to wash off</li>
    <li> I dont believe that this product was worth the hype that a bunch of youtubers give it. I still use it everyday though.</li>
    <li> Good product. The shape made it a little awkward to apply to my thin lashes but you get used to it quickly and it does the job</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara, love the curved brush.  Makes my lashes stand out</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Mascara. What else is there really to say? I&#x27;ve had no issues, easy to apply, usually only have to put it on once in the morning.</li>
    <li> great mascara for the price</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of maybelline mascaras, and the original falsies is one of my all time favorite so I was really excited to try this one... I did not like this version tho, it is too thick... I don&#x27;t know if it is the formula or the brush, but it doens&#x27;t work on my eyelashes... it is a clumping mess :(</li>
    <li> just ok.  i recently bought million lashes and i love that better by far.  i use mascara nearly every day and would recommend getting million lashes over this product.</li>
    <li> The Falsies is an excellent mascara that both darkens and lengthens the appearance of my lashes. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mascaras and this one has become my go-to for a night out. It doesn&#x27;t clump like volumizing mascaras and the spoon brush adds curl AND definition unlike Define-A-Lash, that always undoes the effect of using an eyelash curler and makes the lashes too dry.  I would recommend the Falsies to anyone who appreciates the beauty of well-done eyes.</li>
    <li> This is amazing im a 13 year old girl and fell in love with it!!!! I would recomend this to my friends!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this in the past, and it worked great... I tried for a while a few more pricy names from makeup stores, but they never really worked as well- so I&#x27;m back to this again. My lashes are pretty long to start with, but have are lighter (almost blond) at the base and the ends of the lash. This makes them look just as long as they really are, and I&#x27;m happy to be back to a reliable product.</li>
    <li> This mascara clumps up and flakes so bad! I really wanted to love this mascara but just couldn&#x27;t. I couldn&#x27;t even wear it. I had to throw it out it dried up so quickly.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mascara, the curved applicator really helps.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I have used The Falsies mascara before in other colors and absolutely loved it. I always get compliments on the length and volume of my lashes and the mascara really makes my eye makeup stand out. The Black Drama color does the same thing, but it seems to have a higher wax content than the other colors I&#x27;ve used. It is thick and a bit greasy (a day I wore glasses instead of contacts, it left a grease stain on my lenses). It is also difficult to wash off. I use [[ASIN:B004DK57M4 Neutrogena Naturals Facial Cleanser, Purifying, 6 oz.]], which takes off my makeup easily. In order to get the mascara off of my lashes, I have to rub a but of cleanser between my fingers and use my fingers to lather up my lashes (with eyes closed, of course). That&#x27;s too much work! I hope that this formula change doesn&#x27;t apply to other Falsies colors. I&#x27;d be happy to continue using this product, only not the Black Drama version of it.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to mascara, and the one I purchase over and over. It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t tend to clump, and can build in layers to get long fluttery lashes. I don&#x27;t have super thin lashes, but this bulks them up and makes them look great even without a curler. I use the washable formula on my top lashes and the waterproof in my bottom lashes as my eyes water like crazy, especially in winter.</li>
    <li> makes my lashes look amazing and it also came quickly too which was very nice. husband loves when i wear it .</li>
    <li> Super Lashes!!! Love em!! Really cool! I got this and when I want that Falsie look I just put ONE coat ! A friend of mines used it and she went skeptical with the outcome! She loved it!</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I order Maybelline New York The Falsies Volum&#x27; Express Washable Mascara, Black Drama 285, but coming 385. I want the 285.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I have naturally long lashes, they used to be fuller but I&#x27;ve lost that volume over the years. I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B0039UTO5A CoverGirl LashBlastFusion Mascara Very Black 860, 13.1 ml, 1 Tube]] for 2 or 3 years but decided to try this. I hate the spoon-style brush, I feel I can&#x27;t control the application. My lashes don&#x27;t feel soft either. At least it washes off easily with cleanser/water. I&#x27;ll use this one but after this, I&#x27;m going back to CoverGirl.</li>
    <li> These are great! They do clump if you apply many layers. But I usually use this after using a lengthening mascara.</li>
    <li> The color is good and what I expected however it clumps and then flakes off, I am not a fan. I would rather spend more if that is what I need to do to get something I like and can use.This actually flaked off and into my eye and I wear contacts. I was not a happy camper!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite got it fast too and price great</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara because I saw &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; reviews, however I do not find it to be that great. It is very thick and I believe that the reason it clumps. I will not purchase again because it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I received it dried my wife could not used it, only few time she applied and it was all gone, dried!</li>
    <li> As a mascara connoisseur, I had high hopes for this one.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s one of the worst ones out there.  I have long, fine lashes and was hoping this would add that \\&quot;falsie\\&quot; ooumph.  Not so much.  The formula contains a high wax ratio that causes the product to clump and flake like crazy!  My lashes immediately gooped together at the base, and then with one coat I got \\&quot;tarantula eye\\&quot; near the tips.  The best mascaras are sleek and mend the tip of lashes to points in order to look longer.  This made the tips of my lashes nearly rectangular with product and very clumpy.  I tried it for 4 days then gave up.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time as it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes, most do within an hour or two. Good price</li>
    <li> gives you a thicker lashes when applied. for it&#x27;s price you get more than what you pay for. it&#x27;s easy to remove but has that waterproof effect.</li>
    <li> Goes on very nice, looks very nices......runs if you sweat, walk into a mister, or waterfall.  Looks stupid and is hard to wipe off once under your eyes.  Dries slow too so get get pokey dot eyes too.  boo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara since it came out, and have no plans to try anything else. My lashes are longer and thinker than with any other mascara. I have tried nearly every department store brand mascara and none an compare to the performance of this one. It takes some skill to apply so give it a week to get used to, as it has a unique consistency.</li>
    <li> Everything is good..except, this mascara smears too easily.  Will probably not purchase in future.  my fault, thought it was waterrproof.</li>
    <li> I like that it has fibers, but otherwise I don&#x27;t like the formula of this mascara. It&#x27;s too clumpy and thick. I know they&#x27;re supposed to look like falsies, and maybe it does too good of a job because it makes me look like an over-made-up hooker. The deal breaker for me, though was that it makes my eyelashes break off and fall out. If you want a volumizing and lengthening mascara with fibers and conditioning agents, go with the original Japanese version of Fairydrops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras looking for the perfect match for my average-volume, longer-length lashes. I tried the expensive mascaras, which were generally a miss. YSL, Dior, Benefit,  etc -- they were OK. They added some length, but they wouldn&#x27;t volumize as well (or vice versa). They didn&#x27;t perform well enough for me to validate spending $20+ on a single tube, so I finally said screw it and gave this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used anything else since. This adds length and volumizes my eyelashes the perfect amount without clumping. I wouldn&#x27;t say it looks like I&#x27;m wearing falsies, but I don&#x27;t NEED falsies with this mascara. This gives me a thicker, moderately more dramatic look that works well with both neutral and &#x27;intense&#x27; makeup. I won&#x27;t use any other mascara now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, however, a little difficult to get off. It tends to leave dark black blobs under my eyes unless I wash my eyes two or three times. I don&#x27;t mind it, though -- the non-waterproof version hasn&#x27;t run/streaked during rain, when I&#x27;ve been hit in the face by beach waves, or during my monthly sessions of self-loathing, PMS-induced sobbing. A+++, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Brand new the product comes out clumpy. The brush feels flimsy as well and makes it hard to scrap the extra mascera onto the edges of the tube.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, if you haven&#x27;t tried the new Maybelline Falsies Mascara you really need to give it a try.  It comes in a smaller holder than the old Falsies and it&#x27;s much, much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the Old Falsies was &#x27;meh&#x27;.  It didn&#x27;t do much more than dye your lashes and I didn&#x27;t care for it much.  The New Falsies is just awesome.  I mean I&#x27;m an older woman and I actually have to go easy because I&#x27;m sort of conservative make-up-wise and I don&#x27;t want to look too made up.  This mascara really builds length for me -- with just one coat.  And I finally can actually see my lower lashes and my top lashes look like I&#x27;m wear fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for this product is that it&#x27;s not waterproof.  It&#x27;s not &#x27;runny&#x27;, but if you rub your eyes, you are going to see smudges.  Also, I should add that I have really sensitive eyes --allergies and whatnot make them itchy and watery-- and I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with this irritating my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed.  But make sure you shop for the new smaller container.  Otherwise you are likely to get the old so-so mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~&lt;br /&gt;mom/fur mom</li>
    <li> WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN.  TOO THICK AND VERY CLUMPY WHEN APPLIED; BRUSH IS NOT DESIGNED WELL FOR APPLICATION.  BACK TO THAT OLD STANDBY, GREAT LASH BY MAYBELLINE!!!</li>
    <li> I live on a dorm, so I had to buy on-line for simple cosmetics. The product was as I expected. Good trade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras and it&#x27;s definitely the best. It gives me super long thick lashes. Some people have even asked if I have fake eyelashes. I think I&#x27;ll use it for years, because I haven&#x27;t find anything else that is as good.</li>
    <li> I buy whatever my 20-something daughter buys.  She got me started on this, and I love it. It wears well, all day long.  My lashes look thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> In the mascara, I expect two things.&lt;br /&gt;1. volume up enough&lt;br /&gt;2. Dont get spread under the eyeline.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnot make me satisfy on both of them.</li>
    <li> this one can not prevent water, alway make the skin near the eye black, i really hate it!</li>
    <li> As someone that grew up with Mabelline Great Lash mascara,  I was looking forward to trying this incarnation from the same company.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does build up skimpy lashes, but if you have full lashes, this mascara will clump like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Even the first application from a fresh tube will be heavy and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That will probably be a good thing for those with sparse, thin lashes. Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t give &#x27;raccoon eye&#x27; after a few hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make my sensitive eyes itch.</li>
    <li> I have tried maybelline&#x27;s other mascaras, and i liked them but this one is way too clumpy, i had to wipe off so much of it before applying it, i even wiped it off the little brush with a wet wipe, that&#x27;s the only way i can use it!</li>
    <li> OK mascara. I was annoyed because this product was already partially dried out (definitey not a brand new product), but considering that, application was ok. If I bought a new &#x27;fresh&#x27; one this product would have been better.</li>
    <li> It was really horrible. It was already clumpy and dried out. I was highly disappointed. I won&#x27;t buy that product again but will for sure try another product of theirs.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
    <li> Clumping and flecks around my eyes within 2 hours of applying.</li>
    <li> An excellent product.</li>
    <li> My lashes look really long and it doesn&#x27;t get all gloppy!&lt;br /&gt;  It washes off with soap &amp; water!  It&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this mascara. it works great. it got here fast. and it is a wonderful color and fit</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the formula or brush but it clumps on me, so sad!  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It is what you pay for. The bad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t stay in your eyelashes that much. You will drop black tears!!</li>
    <li> I like this mascara. This product makes my lashes pop. I already have long lashes, but they really make them *pop*, and best of all, it washes off very easily! I hate having to scrub so hard to where my eyelashes break off. Well, this works perfectly and I am happy I purchased two of them. Woooot!</li>
    <li> I am really let down by this product. Not at all as advertised (and I have decent lashes to begin with) and product starts out clumpy and smudgy.</li>
