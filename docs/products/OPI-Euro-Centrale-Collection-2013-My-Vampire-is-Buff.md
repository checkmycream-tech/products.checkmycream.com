<li> put this polish on over an opi natural nail basecoat, and it streaked a little.</li>
<li> and then it chips the next day because you have at least 5 total coats of nail polish on.</li>
<li> It also takes at least 3 coats (I should have done 4 for complete coverage) or it looks streaky</li>
<li> I must say, it seems to take a little longer to dry than my other polishes.</li>
<li> But  as a color,it is too difficult to achieve a uniform finish especially because I have my natural nails and also have some ridges,</li>
<li> I thought it was going to be a little whiter than it is, but it will do for now</li>
<li> Was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t go on as well as I had hoped.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with opi.</li>
<li> I am obsessed with this color!</li>
<li> I would wear this polish forever and never get bored!!</li>

    <li> This is a great neutral color, although it doesn&#x27;t have the same yellowish tone in person as it seems to in the picture. It also takes at least 3 coats (I should have done 4 for complete coverage) or it looks streaky and then it chips the next day because you have at least 5 total coats of nail polish on. I&#x27;ll try chilling it first next time, but I won&#x27;t count on it for more than a day or so.</li>
    <li> I love this color a lot!!  OPI is one of the best nail polishes around.  It doesn&#x27;t chip off easily.  This is one of my favorite colors of all time of all neutral colors.</li>
    <li> Great colour, shipped on time, packaged well, just wish it didn&#x27;t take 3 costs for the colour to be solid.</li>
    <li> The color is more opaque than I expected, but still very pretty. Chipped quickly but I put on three coats so that may be why.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say, it&#x27;s basically the perfect off-white. Applies evenly, not streaky, it&#x27;s a very strong color. I apply two coats always, but that&#x27;s just personal preference.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous polish. Fast shipping! My new go-to color! I love Essie Marshmallow but this OPI color - My Vampire is Buff is just as beautiful! Love it!</li>
    <li> A beautiful, classy color that goes on well.</li>

    <li> This is one gorgeous neutral color!I bought it as a base color for nail art, but the color is so nice it could be worn all on its own. It&#x27;s a beige yellow tinged cream.</li>
    <li> color was not what i expected not happy at all did not look good on my hands at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sheila h</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a little whiter than it is, but it will do for now</li>

    <li> This colour is amazing, super gorgeous. Actually thought it would be too light/pale for my caramel complexion but I absolutely fell in love 😍. I would wear this polish forever and never get bored!!</li>
    <li> Love this color and love OPI, This color does take 3 coats to be completely covered, but still worth it.  It&#x27;s a great beige without any hint of pink.</li>
    <li> I got ordered this nail polish about a week ago. I absolutely love this color! It is very classy and great for any occasion. It doesn&#x27;t chip and it looks great with a nice, shiny top coat. My package arrived before it&#x27;s original delivery date. I would recommend this color to others who love a classy nude shade.</li>
    <li> This polish is to die for! Naturally beautiful. I first wore this after a trip to the nail salon and decided I had to own it. It never disappoints.</li>
    <li> Exactly the color I was looking for!</li>
    <li> very pretty color. It&#x27;s like a French vanilla color.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty, neutral color, which is exactly what I wanted!  I must say, it seems to take a little longer to dry than my other polishes.</li>
    <li> I love this pale color--a hint of baby pink, a hint of taupe, a hint of white--a great neutral that goes with anything and everything. It&#x27;s the creamy but not yellow, white but not stark, nail color I&#x27;ve been looking for for years. So excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this polish on over an opi natural nail basecoat, and it streaked a little. Had to do two coats to get full coverage, but looks great after that. If you have darker nails you may need three coats. Was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t go on as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Perfect color for fall. I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect shade color and have finally found it! I will definitely be wearing this shade all season.</li>
