      <li>The colors are beautiful!  </li>
      <li>but the colors are great and the smell doesn&#x27;t worry me about using it on my daughter.</li>
      <li>My girls, ages 4 and 6, are happy.</li>
      <li>No smell and is great for toddlers</li>
      <li>The piggy paint is non-toxic and a great variety of colors.</li>
      <li>Great for when the girls want to be &#x27;fancy.&#x27;</li>

      <li>Great non-toxic polish that is safe for kids.</li>
      <li>Love non toxic piggy paint!</li>
      <li>SAFE!</li>
      <li>For nails they are nice.</li>
      <li>It looks really nice.</li>
      <li>Good price for safe nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>We purchased this set as a gift — cute colors and cute bag!</li>
      <li>if any and the colors are super bright which I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would be.</li>
      <li>She just loves it,and so does my daughter because it is safe to use for children.</li>
      <li>better than acquerella.</li>
      <li>WE love this.</li>
      <li>I love piggy paint.</li>
      <li>We love it.</li>
      <li>It is the only kind of fingernail polish I will allow and I use it too!!  </li>
      <li>Love all the fun colors and it cleans up easy.</li>
      <li>wanted a chemical free alternative for my daughter.</li>
      <li>They chip easily when only doing one coat, but the colors are vibrant and the fact they are nontoxic is perfect.  </li>
      <li>The description at the time I ordered (and the picture) stated: &amp;#34;Set includes Fairy Fabulous, Angel Kisses, Dragon Tears nail polish.</li>
      <li>I especially love the green in this set.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not fumey, it&#x27;s adorable, &amp; the colors are very vibrant!  </li>
      <li>My daughter loves it so much I have to go get more colors.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
      <li>Colors are pretty but the paint comes off within a day!</li>
      <li>These are so fun.</li>
      <li>Very nice product for little ones!</li>
      <li>The green is a nice, shimmery color, and the purple is fine.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last long and it chips very easily, but is cute to wear for a day or two.</li>
      <li>This paint is so pretty.</li>
      <li>unfortunately I had to use file on my nails and a PUMICE stone LOL!</li>
      <li>My daughter was exposed to painting her nails earlier than I liked (not even 2 years old!)</li>
      <li>I like it because it&#x27;s very safe for little kids.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to cover tiny toenails.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this product but the price is too high considering some of the design flaws- the brushes have bristles falling out or that are too long.</li>
      <li>it wears off very quickly, the kiddo needs a new manicure every couple of days, however kids are rather rough on their hands with all their playing, she still has fun getting painted nails.</li>
      <li>We use a blow dryer to dry them quickly, which is also fun for her.</li>
      <li>It comes off little finger nails easily but that&#x27;s okay since the fun part for little ones is painting the nails.</li>
      <li>-Color: Turquoise, Light Pink, Light Green.&amp;#34; I specifically ordered for the turquoise and light green, the light pink was just a bonus, I need colors that weren&#x27;t particularly girly.</li>
      <li>But they ask for red or blue or orange, and I can&#x27;t find those in child-safe formulas :-)</li>
      <li>The colors in this set are opaque and vibrant.</li>
      <li>My youngest daughter has always been excluded from nail painting since what we had on hand were gifts to older siblings (and when they offered to share, I&#x27;d never want her exposed to that chemical junk anyway).  </li>
      <li>The colors are great - they last reasonably long and if a little kid (or the mom) wants to use her nail to scratch it off -</li>
      <li>Our 3 year old paints her whole feet and hands</li>
      <li>She has so enjoyed us painting her nails in the patterns she requests, and it lasts a few days on my preschooler if she takes a nap after applying to give it time to set.  </li>
      <li>Love this paint for my little girl!</li>
      <li>Colors are always pretty and dry fast.</li>
      <li>I used regular nail polish first time and they always smelled.</li>
      <li>Nearly two year old loves!.</li>
      <li>I have a bunch of different colors and it has made clipping her nails much easier.</li>
      <li>My 4 year old girl loves this nail polish.</li>
      <li>Only issue is that it flakes off really fast</li>
      <li>My 4 year old granddaughter loves the colors, and I like that the paints are child-safe.</li>
      <li>I like that for my 4 year old.</li>
      <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is they come off/wear off very fast and easily which upsets my daughter, and I am also forced to paint nails often.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately the nail polish arrived covered in the beautiful purple nail polish because the top of the purple bottle broke during shipping and spilled paint everywhere :(  </li>
      <li>You take old makeup containers and put nail polish in them to dry to look like makeup they can play with.</li>
      <li>The polish usually only lasts a couple days on her fingers (longer on her toes), but for a 2 year old that is plenty long enough.</li>
      <li>The colors don&#x27;t last long, but they dry quickly after applied, and the brush is little</li>
      <li>I was very surprised to read other comments</li>

<li> Yes they might not last as long as regular nail polish</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as traditional polish, but when you&#x27;re painting kid nails, longevity isn&#x27;t to be expected.  </li>
<li> The colors are appropriate, versatile, and no headache inducing smells or scary toxic ingredients!</li>
<li> My daughter loves these paints and I don&#x27;t have to panic if she forgets to let them dry and try&#x27;s to eat something.  </li>
<li> and we blow on her toes together until they dry.</li>
<li> The pink is almost transparent, even after three coats.</li>
<li> The set I received included a light green, purple and pink, so unfortunately I will have to return it.</li>
<li> The green is shimmery but the pink and purple are just regular pastel colored polish.</li>
<li> These dried fast and did not have a nasty nail polish smell so she can enjoy playing and acting like she is putting on makeup.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t really see how you can go wrong with these.</li>
<li> I wish they made some less &#x27;girly&#x27; colors.</li>
<li> I got these mainly to make fake make up for my daughter.</li>
<li> the pink is very very pale and not noticeable</li>
<li> My little boys sometimes want me to paint their toes, when they see their sister.</li>
<li> My grand-daughter received the Piggy Paint Little Chick set for a gift.</li>
<li> Starts chipping off within a few days.</li>
<li> I know being picky about the color sounds silly, but daddy says no pink/purple polish on his twin boys toes (to help identify them in the early days after their arrival).</li>
<li> Very little smell</li>
<li> The bottles are not too small</li>
<li> I had to use at least two layers to make the polish look even.</li>
<li> What I don&#x27;t like is that it is so hard to remove!</li>
<li> Unfortunately the item I received was not as described.</li>
<li> The price isn&#x27;t awful in the three pack, and like all nail polish they will last you forever.  </li>
<li> One star off because they are so expensive!</li>
<li> no purple nails for these girlies :(</li>

    <li> My daughter loves these paints and I don&#x27;t have to panic if she forgets to let them dry and try&#x27;s to eat something.  She isn&#x27;t patient.  They chip easily when only doing one coat, but the colors are vibrant and the fact they are nontoxic is perfect.  The price isn&#x27;t awful in the three pack, and like all nail polish they will last you forever.  I don&#x27;t really see how you can go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> The colors in this set are opaque and vibrant. Love non toxic piggy paint!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long and it chips very easily, but is cute to wear for a day or two. No smell and is great for toddlers</li>
    <li> The piggy paint is non-toxic and a great variety of colors. This is a wonderful brand of nailpolish for children. My grand-daughter received the Piggy Paint Little Chick set for a gift. She just loves it,and so does my daughter because it is safe to use for children. I will purchase this brand for gifts in the future.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful!  Unfortunately the nail polish arrived covered in the beautiful purple nail polish because the top of the purple bottle broke during shipping and spilled paint everywhere :(  no purple nails for these girlies :(</li>

    <li> I love the idea of this product but the price is too high considering some of the design flaws- the brushes have bristles falling out or that are too long.</li>
    <li> Colors are pretty but the paint comes off within a day! Well, it lasted a day for my daughter but she wanted to paint my nails and it came off within hours.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old girl loves this nail polish. We purchased this set as a gift — cute colors and cute bag!</li>
    <li> SAFE! Yes they might not last as long as regular nail polish but the colors are great and the smell doesn&#x27;t worry me about using it on my daughter.</li>
    <li> I lick this polish a lot. wanted a chemical free alternative for my daughter. better than acquerella. haven&#x27;t tried their polish remover yet.</li>
    <li> I love piggy paint. My daughter was exposed to painting her nails earlier than I liked (not even 2 years old!) when my mother in law painted her nails without asking. So to have some control over what was on my daughter I bought a bunch of piggy polish. My daughter loves it. I have a bunch of different colors and it has made clipping her nails much easier. Now she knows she only gets nail polish when all her nails are properly clipped.  We use a blow dryer to dry them quickly, which is also fun for her. The polish usually only lasts a couple days on her fingers (longer on her toes), but for a 2 year old that is plenty long enough. I especially love the green in this set. It looks really nice.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old granddaughter loves the colors, and I like that the paints are child-safe.</li>
    <li> Very little smell if any and the colors are super bright which I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would be. The bottles are not too small so that is good.</li>
    <li> I got these mainly to make fake make up for my daughter. You take old makeup containers and put nail polish in them to dry to look like makeup they can play with. I used regular nail polish first time and they always smelled. These dried fast and did not have a nasty nail polish smell so she can enjoy playing and acting like she is putting on makeup. For nails they are nice. Colors are always pretty and dry fast. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is they come off/wear off very fast and easily which upsets my daughter, and I am also forced to paint nails often.</li>
    <li> Nearly two year old loves!. She enjoys picking out the color, sits still while I paint and we blow on her toes together until they dry. The colors don&#x27;t last long, but they dry quickly after applied, and the brush is little so it&#x27;s easy to cover tiny toenails.</li>
    <li> WE love this. Our 3 year old paints her whole feet and hands so we had to find something that was actually non-toxic.  We love it. we are repeat customers of piggy paint.  The colors are great - they last reasonably long and if a little kid (or the mom) wants to use her nail to scratch it off - you CAN.  Or use the remover which we also have and is also non-toxic.  Great for when the girls want to be &#x27;fancy.&#x27;</li>
    <li> My kid loves it. The green is a nice, shimmery color, and the purple is fine. The pink is almost transparent, even after three coats.</li>
    <li> Great non-toxic polish that is safe for kids. Love all the fun colors and it cleans up easy. It comes off little finger nails easily but that&#x27;s okay since the fun part for little ones is painting the nails. Good price for safe nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;When used on adults the nail polish stays on quite well, recommend getting the piggy paint remover to get it off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not fumey, it&#x27;s adorable, &amp; the colors are very vibrant!  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as traditional polish, but when you&#x27;re painting kid nails, longevity isn&#x27;t to be expected.  Very nice product for little ones!</li>
    <li> The green is shimmery but the pink and purple are just regular pastel colored polish. I had to use at least two layers to make the polish look even. My girls, ages 4 and 6, are happy. One star off because they are so expensive!</li>
    <li> it wears off very quickly, the kiddo needs a new manicure every couple of days, however kids are rather rough on their hands with all their playing, she still has fun getting painted nails. the pink is very very pale and not noticeable</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t smell gross. What I don&#x27;t like is that it is so hard to remove! Regular nail polish remover does not work! I was very surprised to read other comments, that said that it comes off after washing your hands. Mine did not. My daughter painted my nails and I thought I would remove it later the same day with regular nail polish, but unfortunately I had to use file on my nails and a PUMICE stone LOL! 3 days after my 3yo painted her nails the color is still there and she takes a bath every day and washes her hands often.</li>
    <li> This paint is so pretty. My daughter loves it so much I have to go get more colors. I like it because it&#x27;s very safe for little kids. It comes off after about a week without using nail polish remover. I like that for my 4 year old.</li>
    <li> These are so fun. We&#x27;ve been painting my daughter&#x27;s nails now for months. Only issue is that it flakes off really fast and it was spendy.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the item I received was not as described. The description at the time I ordered (and the picture) stated: &amp;#34;Set includes Fairy Fabulous, Angel Kisses, Dragon Tears nail polish. Color/Finish: -Color: Turquoise, Light Pink, Light Green.&amp;#34; I specifically ordered for the turquoise and light green, the light pink was just a bonus, I need colors that weren&#x27;t particularly girly. The set I received included a light green, purple and pink, so unfortunately I will have to return it. I know being picky about the color sounds silly, but daddy says no pink/purple polish on his twin boys toes (to help identify them in the early days after their arrival).</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly.  Our daughter loves piggy paint.  It is the only kind of fingernail polish I will allow and I use it too!!  Starts chipping off within a few days.</li>
    <li> Love this paint for my little girl! I wish they made some less &#x27;girly&#x27; colors. My little boys sometimes want me to paint their toes, when they see their sister. But they ask for red or blue or orange, and I can&#x27;t find those in child-safe formulas :-)</li>
