      <li>It arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>and I love the cool feeling as I put it on.  </li>

      <li>price is also reasonable too</li>

    <li> Nicely packaged cream. My cousin really likes it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this cream never breaks me out.  It also leaves my skin soft and it really is moisturizing all day!</li>
    <li> I was really surprised how much I loved this product!!!  It made my skin look healthier and less dry!  I would tell anyone to try this!!!</li>
    <li> I only wish it had a semi-transparent container like the other EA creams. Otherwise, everything was great: packaging, delivery time, price, etc.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon!  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else and I got so depressed.  It is the best all around moisturizer that I have found.  It is light  (no SPF to make it thick) and I love the cool feeling as I put it on.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Never thought I will ever try EA for moisture cream... Then tried n in just two hours, yes not days but hours felt the difference. It gets in ur skin like magic n without shine n grease makes it look supple n complete. Would recommend it to each one looking for a face glowing with health and happy.</li>
    <li> No greedy smell, fill so good to put it to skin. This is perfect to keep my health with this. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and love it.  It is not greasy and leaves my face so very soft.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always like Elizabeth Arden and have used this product before.  It works well for me.  Most would like it.</li>
    <li> Ilove this cream, my skin showed visible results within 7 to 10 days after starting it.  The cream is not heavy and does not block pores but gives a very nice moisturized look to the skin.  Would purchase it again</li>
    <li> I finally got my order today.  However, I figured out it produced March.2009.  Its expiry date is only 3months left.  That&#x27;s why it is chiper than Macys</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  I have used it for a few years and bought other creams that were supposed to do better things for my skin.  I ended up with a big dryed out mess.  I went back to this cream and my skin straightened right back to healthy.  I won&#x27;t try anything else again.  I would highly recommend this cream.  You can find it cheaper at mar. or ross.</li>
    <li> My friends love it. Good price and quality as expected.&lt;br /&gt;i will buy more for my friends later on with this price.</li>
    <li> Pretty good moisturizer.  Been using this along with other products so I can say with any certainty that this product helps eliminate fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be got for $14.99 at Ross and sometimes at Marshalls so WHY PAY MORE when they are in stock there or for a comparable price here.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> This cream was given to me originally as a sample. I ordered more because I loved the way it felt on my skin. Actually feels like it is moisturizing for the entire day and night. Even lines seemed to get softer, as if the skin was parched before using this cream. Smells like cucumber to me and I don&#x27;t know if they make a body cream like this --but it would be like a full-body mini spa. Love, love, love it. That said, it is VERY light. Some people like the heavier cream for the winter like Visible Difference, but for me, this cream feels so much like a pick-me-up, that it&#x27;s just what I needed. If you like heavier cream in winter, try this in the summer.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I have extremely dry skin. Makes my skin feel great and last all day long.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time, but was having trouble finding it anywhere. I was very excited that I found it so I bought several of it. It arrived very quickly. It was a really good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend. She told me it&#x27;s a bit oily when u put it on. Well this is not what we expected. Otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> This is by far the absolute worst moisturizer. As soon as I put it on my skin at night, I felt an unpleasant burning. It hurt my face. The next morning when I woke up, I had a rash all over my face. It was red, dry, patchy, and super itchy. My mom and friend tried it, and the same thing happened, so it was not an allergic reaction. I would never recommend this cream to anyone. I would give it -5 stars if I could</li>
    <li> i have tried a lot of different creams on my oily skin and they are either too rich or not moisturizing enough. this is just right for me - it&#x27;s so lightweight and has a cool cucumber smell, and gets absorbed by the skin right away. and it keeps my skin perfectly moistured for the day. my mom also uses this and loves it too. price is also reasonable too</li>
