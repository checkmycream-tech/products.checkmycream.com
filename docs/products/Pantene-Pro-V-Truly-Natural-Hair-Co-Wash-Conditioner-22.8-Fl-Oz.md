      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>This co-wash cleanser did everything I needed, and more.  </li>
      <li>The product has oil in it, so i&#x27;m sure that is what&#x27;s helping.</li>
      <li>but they were all out of the co-wash except CVS (and CVS didn&#x27;t have many).  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t suffer from allergies, please by all means, try this product as I think you will find it a refreshing addition to your hair care.</li>
      <li>I followed up with Tresseme Naturals conditioner, and my 3b/c hair was soft, clean, and perfect.  </li>
      <li>Each time, I felt it did a good job detangling, but not such a good job cleaning.  </li>
      <li>Much better than the L-----l product and doesn&#x27;t have that cheap perfume smell.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own, lol) and combing it through my wet hair in the shower is fabulous!</li>
      <li>During that time, I could easily finger comb my hair with no problem.</li>
      <li>, Then massage like I would when shampooing, then rinse just a bit then apply the rest from end up to scalp and doing it that way for some reason makes the comb out easy.</li>
      <li>When I wash the product out my hair was still detangled and easy to style.</li>
      <li>My hair was definitely easy to brush, but I feel it didn&#x27;t get my roots</li>
      <li>The reviewer that said this didn&#x27;t work for caucasian hair is not entirely correct, cuz it works beautifully on my caucasian hair.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine color treated hair.</li>
      <li>My hair looked fine for about 8 hours before it began to look greasy.  </li>
      <li>I am caucasian with fine 2c/3a hair at BSL.  </li>
      <li>I prefer something cone free.</li>
      <li>I use it as my only cleansing/shampoo and it works great.</li>
      <li>Or shampoo and use a light conditioner as a leave-in to get curls.  </li>
      <li>I discontinued using this product for a year but just couldn&#x27;t find anything else that I liked as much</li>
      <li>My hair is tangle free and managable without being frizzy and tangled.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This product was so good at detangling, that I only needed to do a once through before I was able to put it up to</li>
      <li>Lots of times the WEN left my own hair feeling kind of stripped.</li>
      <li>MUCH CHEAPER!!!</li>
      <li>I am on my second bottle of this, and I love it!!</li>
      <li>Terrific slip, and a great clean.  </li>
      <li>It is water based so some people may not want to use it as a hairdressing on already flat ironed or hair that has already been styled for the day,but that stuff works great on her</li>
      <li>I can enjoy long hair that looks and feels great.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I thought it was ok, but i&#x27;ve continued to use it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First off, since a lot of reviewers are mentioning this as a hair product for AA hair, I want to share that I am white with long, fine hair.  My hair is wavy to straight, def not curly.  However, over the course of the past year it has become harder and harder to comb through.  I went from washing my hair every other day to washing as little as possible.  It just was not worth the effort of combing out all those tangles.  I asked my hairdresser if coloring my hair had stripped it, or if my hair was damaged from a 6 week swim class I had with my daughter at the local overly-chlorinated YMCA pool.  My hairdresser assured me in repeated visits that clarifying shampoo and other expensive products I was using were doing their jobs just fine.  HOWEVER, this did not solve the problem of my NOT being able to comb through my long hair anymore.  I&#x27;ve had long hair in the past, off and on.  This has been the only year when it&#x27;s been uncombable with tons of leave-in conditioner or other product.  Maybe it&#x27;s not a crisis, but it&#x27;s annoying and frankly, with four kids, I have better things to do than work knots out of my hair every time I get cleaned up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS CO-WASH changed all that.  I wanted to try Wen but the price tag about choked me!  When I saw this co-wash at the corner drug store I figured it was worth a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I use this every other day with no other conditioner and I can now comb through my hair in seconds, just like I used to!  (I&#x27;m still not convinced that color and chlorine didn&#x27;t damage my hair somewhat.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this co-wash is that it leaves my roots greasy on day 2.  I rinse my hair on day 2 and do a conditioner on the ends...or if life is hectic I&#x27;ll do dry shampoo on the roots and run with it.  My hair feels better and looks pretty down.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this on my newly natural hair I HATED IT! It was nightmare for my hair, that was perhaps three months ago. I put it away under my kitchen sink and vowed to never use it again. Fast forward to today, after a failed hair style attempt I didn&#x27;t want to use my coconut cowash so I decided to give this another shot and I was BLOWN AWAY!!! My hair feels sooo good, from the second I put it in my hair I was amazed. And I have low porous multi textured so I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding anything that works this well. I&#x27;ve always been a Pantene fan, I used the relaxed and natural for a long while on my relaxed hair so I was really bummed when this initially didn&#x27;t work, but I&#x27;m happy I gave it another try. My new fave!</li>
    <li> I have never co-washed but got tired of all of the hair that would come out when I washed ( I have 4a-4c hair) and wanted to try a co-wash. I picked this up yesterday from Taget for 5 BUCKS!! It&#x27;s a big bottle so did not feel like I had to use it sparingly. It does have a good slip and once it was combed through, I then use my staple cleanser, WEN Fig. No complaints so far. Go to Target.. MUCH CHEAPER!!!</li>
    <li> BUY THIS SAME PRODUCT AT WALMART.COM FOR $4.97!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair feeling very soft and manageable, it&#x27;s a keeper! The co-wash conditioner is new to the Pantene line and is already one of my favorite go to products when my hair is feeling bogged down with product build up.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair 2a/b type that has gotten drier over the years with coloring. Strong dandruff shampoos made it worse and gave me dry itchy scalp. I have spent a lot of money on expensive conditioners and scalp treatments and sulfate free shampoos  but the products worked for a short time only.&lt;br /&gt;I have use the co wash for 2 weeks and the improvement in my hair and scalp is unbelievable. My hair is so soft that I can&#x27;t believe it is my hair. My scalp is not dry and itchy. The dandruff is almost gone. Love this product :)</li>
    <li> I have very dry, very damaged hair, and am CONSTANTLY on the search for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; products for my hair.  I have now tried just about every shampoo and conditioner available, ranging from very cheap drugstore products, to very expensive salon products.  I&#x27;ve also tried a few infomercial products.  While I have found several products I do like very much, I am still on the search...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having heard that Pantene Co-Wash might be a good alternative to my expensive infomercial cleansing conditioner, I purchased the large bottle and gave it a go.  After following the directions to wash into my hair and then let it sit for a minute before rinsing, I towel-dried my hair and then let it dry naturally (my wavy, frizzy hair usually does better air-drying than it does being dried via hair dryer).  My hair was definitely easy to brush, but I feel it didn&#x27;t get my roots very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it again.  And then again.  Each time, I felt it did a good job detangling, but not such a good job cleaning.  My hair looked fine for about 8 hours before it began to look greasy.  Getting my very dry hair to look greasy is not an easy feat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say this is a decent cleansing conditioner for dry, damaged hair, but it might leave some people&#x27;s hair (mine included) looking a bit greasy, especially after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is marketed for African-American hair, it works for other textures of hair, as well.  I have very fine, dry, damaged Caucasian hair, and it works for my hair texture, as well.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at walmart for around five bucks after deciding to co-wash my hair because it was getting extremely dry. I have thick long straight hair with maybe a little wave and this stuff was great for me, I use it every other wash..I use a clarifying conditioner with added tea tree oil as my other co-wash. It has a nice smell to it and gives my hair great \\&quot;slip\\&quot;, I however do use a moisturizing conditioner on my ends because it doesn&#x27;t leave them as moisturized as I&#x27;d like. I wasn&#x27;t really that surprised by that considering how it is a cleansing conditioner. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it leaving my hair nasty or greasy but I do massage and scrub my scalp with my fingers and rinse thoroughly. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I used to use Pantene Women of Color Conditioner (or whatever it&#x27;s called) back when I was relaxed and in the beginning of my natural hair journey. I ended up switching to a different conditioner that was cheaper and it actually ended up being more effective, so I haven&#x27;t used Pantene probably in 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about the Truly Natural line and I was a little hesitant about trying it due to past experience with it not adding much moisture to my hair. I heard good things about it so I decided to give the co-wash a shot, hoping it&#x27;d be a cheaper alternative to the As I Am Coconut cowash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my hair in the shower, used a palm sized amount, focusing on my scalp first as I usually do, then started finger detangling the rest of my hair. I&#x27;ll have to admit, the slip is pretty good! This stuff really melted my strands and made finger detangling a breeze - which is most important for me in a conditioner. I also like how thick the product is. When I slathered this on each section, my hair felt coated and moisturized, but not too thick that I had a hard time rinsing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I rinsed it out, my hair still felt soft, but not as soft as I&#x27;d like. Also, the scent does smell good, but it&#x27;s just a tiny bit overpowering, which doesn&#x27;t surprise me since it&#x27;s Pantene. So for those reasons, I give this product 4/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice, don&#x27;t purchase from Amazon. It&#x27;s around 5 bucks at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I let my hair air dry, and there actually wasn&#x27;t enough definition in my wash and go. My hair was a bit poofier and frizzier than usual. I usually don&#x27;t mind a little frizz, but there was a little too much frizz for my liking. I&#x27;ll still give this product a 4/5 considering it does a nice enough job cleaning my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today and I&#x27;m really impressed. This left my scalp feeling clean AND my hair moisturized and easy to detangle. This has strong (love it or hate it)  floral fruity scent that lingers after you rinse. Very good consistency,easy to distribute and rinses clean. I believe this works best in between shampoos to refresh hair and for that purpose, it works well. Lastly, it is OVERPRICED on this site. It retails between-$5-7 for the exact same size at drugstores etc. For reference I have medium length AA unprocessed hair (4a/4b)</li>
    <li> I have never used a cleansing conditioner before I used this for the first time yesterday, like many people, I wanted to try WEN, but the price is so high I didn&#x27;t want to risk paying thirty dollars for something that may not even work well for my hair. I picked this up for about five bucks at WalMart. It has the same nice smell as regular pantene shampoo and conditioner, it isn&#x27;t too strong like some people say. I have very course, dry, frizzy and just poofy hair, very unmanageable and gets tangled very easily, like I can brush it and do nothing and one minute later it would be tangled again, it got to the point where after my hair would dry after a shower I would just put it up in a bun everyday unless I straightened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well enough rambling about my hair...&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got into the shower I wet my hair really well then I had to use quite a bit of this for it to work well for my hair, I put it on my scalp and I massaged my scalp like I would with shampoo then added a little more water then added more conditioner to really saturate my hair right to the ends then I combed through my hair ( usually when I comb through my hair in the shower there is so much hair loss I worry sometimes, but after using this there was noticably less hair loss) and then did everything else I normally do in the shower and rinsed it out thoroughly. After I rinsed it out my hair felt sort of dry and course so I put in a little bit more and rinsed oit out. When I got out I towel dryed my hair then brushed it out and I could feel a difference already, my hair was so soft even wet! Usually I can&#x27;t stand to touch my hair when it is wet. As my hair started drying more it didn&#x27;t poof up like it usually does and my mother said that my hair looked nice, but when it dried all the way it poofed up like it usually does but it was so soft so I just flat ironed my hair last night. Hopefully after a few uses it will tame my poofy mess of hair. But I already love this product and would reccomend it to anybody! And even though it says truly natural hair, imy hair is color treated and it was still fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;about 5 minutes</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because i had seen alot of naturals liked and even loved this stuff, So i went to pick some up at Walgreens. I just now tried it for the first time and i liked the way it felt while i was putting it on my wet hair but when i rinsed it out it felt like i used a shampoo meaning my hair felt kinda stripped and even a bit frizzy. It wasn&#x27;t what i expected it to be but i will say while it was on my hair it had good slip and the size of the bottle and price wise was also good. I just will not be purchasing again and i wouldn&#x27;t recommend for 3b hair types like mine.</li>
    <li> http://youtu.be/7xddHJOq6XE&lt;br /&gt;This is an ok co wash but it has cones and coats hair. So so.  I prefer something cone free. This is very detangling.</li>
    <li> I have used every washing agent on my hair as well as conditioners, when I ran across this in walmart I thought I give it a go. It also was the first time I seen a co-wash. I am between a 4b/c and this instantly made my hair feel clean and easy to detangle (which is usually a time consuming task.) It took me all of five mins to run the comb through. I also felt that it soften my hair and lengthen my curls, lessening the shrinkage!!! When I wash the product out my hair was still detangled and easy to style. I feel that my hair was less dense; for some reason it didn&#x27;t feel as thick as it normally can be. I used it once and am going to continue. Best of luck to all naturals out there!!! I also wanted to add that Ive been natural for almost two years!!</li>
    <li> I just bought this co-wash for 5.99...why does it cost so much here? I absolutely love this co-wash, but the price is jacked up very high on here. You can get this at walgreens, just about any family dollar store. For this price you could get 3 bottles. Don&#x27;t get ripped off, I would never buy at this price.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing, I recieved it in my monthly subscribtion to Curlbox like last summer. Fast forward to this summer I finally gave it a try on my 4a natural hair and I&#x27;m upset I didn&#x27;t try it earlier. I&#x27;m a washNgo wearer and I usually us As I am coconut co wash, no any more. Using Pantene has cause my Wng to retain more length and they look a whole lot fuller.</li>
    <li> I loved the convenience of having a one step product and was prepared to like this cleanser.  Unfortunately it left my somewhat coarse and color treated hair dull and dry.  It just didn&#x27;t condition well enough for me.  I hate to waste this large bottle so will try it on my horse&#x27;s mane and tail.  Maybe it will work for her.</li>
    <li> This is the second cowash that I have tried and it will be the last. This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve been using As I Am Cleansing cowash, which is also a good product. The difference between the two is price and quantity. This product is way cheaper at a local store versus on Amazon. I really like this cowash because it cleansed my hair with one wash. I had some product build up on my hair and scalp and didn&#x27;t want to do a full shampoo. With this cowash, I made sure to thoroughly wet my hair doing some massaging to move the buildup. Then, I lathered with the cowash, massaged it in, and left it on for 15 minutes. During that time, I could easily finger comb my hair with no problem. After rinsing, my hair was very clean, soft, and easy to manage. My scalp felt clean as well. I only used a leave-in conditioner afterwards. When my hair dried, it was still soft. I will definitely continue to use this cowash, probably more often than the As I Am since it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I used it several times in between regular shampoos and it cleaned my hair and left it soft, shiny and manageable. The only caveat I have, and it&#x27;s caused me to quit using the product, is that the fragrance caused me itchy eyes, headaches and sneezing. If you have allergies to scents or perfumes I strongly recommend you find this product in a local store and smell it to see if you react before you purchase it. If you don&#x27;t suffer from allergies, please by all means, try this product as I think you will find it a refreshing addition to your hair care.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;A u tube video describes how to use.&lt;br /&gt;Great for natural hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is good. The smell is tolerable. Got mine from Walmart for $4.49. Pantene is a good line for black hair care.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s one step and smells really good. I apply it at the beginning of my shower and rinse it out at the end. It rinses out easily and makes my hair feel so soft even during the rinse. I can run my fingers through it by the end of the shower with no tangles. I have long, thick, blond hair with highlights that looks dull and frizzy with other shampoos. This makes it so shiny and smooth and saves me a little time too. After washing I just add a little product (argon/moroccan oil) and blow it dry. Even if I let it air dry it looks nice. Because of the price I even use it on my 8yr old daughter&#x27;s hair. Makes combing it out a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this. Not all stores carry it and it can be hard to find in my town so, I think I&#x27;ll put it on automatic delivery, because I can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> Let me start of by saying I use this product alone now for everyone in the house for co-washing. I have relaxed hair that I am trying to transition back to natural. I have about four inches of regrowth and I am trying to avoid the big chop until I have at least ten inches of stretched regrowth. Well due to the two different textures in my head, I have to be very careful about breakage and damage. This stuff has helped me be able to manage my hair when wet very well. My natural hair is that frizzy deep wave pattern. My oldest daughter has very fragile, very dry relaxed hair and my two youngest have natural hair. One has very kinky coiled low porous hair that is actually very long when braided but is the type of hair that has a lot of shrinkage and my other daughter has kind of loose wavy curls but with lots of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of us have long hair and I used to use WEN or the generic version called Just One or one from Sally&#x27;s for years. Both are expensive. WEN is really ridiculous on the price and for our hair at least I had to use a lot to get it slippery. Lots of times the WEN left my own hair feeling kind of stripped. Well I got this a couple years back to try out not thinking much based on the price and let me tell you it has worked great on ALL of our different hair textures! The smell is ten times better too. It has completely replaced WEN/Just One. It really does moisturize/condition the hair, not just detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use this three different ways. First just as it&#x27;s advertised which is a co-wash. Great for when the hair is not very dirty and you don&#x27;t need to use a clarifying shampoo. I will say that I had to apply it a bit differently to my middle baby girls hair to get the best slippage and moisturizing. I think it&#x27;s because like I said, her hair is not very porous. With her hair I have to get it very wet with water a bit hotter than I use on the others, usually I start mid length and apply downward to the ends and then add some to the roots but on her I have to add a bit to the roots first after sectioning it, Then massage like I would when shampooing, then rinse just a bit then apply the rest from end up to scalp and doing it that way for some reason makes the comb out easy.Then I follow with a rinse and go through the normal conditioning process. Secondly I use it as a detangling conditioner after doing a clarifying shampoo. When I use it this way I rinse some of it out after combing, add my other conditioning products and basically sit under a hot cap making it a deep conditioner. and the third way I use this is heavily diluted in a spray bottle of water, like maybe a tablespoon in a smaller spray bottle basically to refresh and re-moisturize my younger girls braid out styles. Lots of times I do it that way before bed. It works great, detangles, good slippage, makes it easy to comb/brush out any dirt or dust that may have got on the hair and a great way to add your butters and sealing oils instead of on dry hair, which may work for some but I have never had luck adding oils to mine or my girls hair while it was dry. I usually only need one bottle of this the whole month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has especially made a huge difference in the condition of my oldest daughters relaxed hair. It is now very healthy where before it was so dry. She was having breakage before. Her hair was like straw at the ends.This and another product that has really combated her dryness is called Olive Cream by Hollywood beauty. It is water based so some people may not want to use it as a hairdressing on already flat ironed or hair that has already been styled for the day,but that stuff works great on her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know hair is one of those things that&#x27;s different for everyone so what this has done for us may not work for you or yours but for the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong in at least giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this stuff by Pantene, I just pray they DO NOT CHANGE THEIR FORMULA! It works great for us just the way it is.st the way it is.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN for the past 2-3 years and it is very expensive. The same friend that introduced me to WEN told me about this Pantene Co-Wash. I tried it and have switched. I actually like this better than the WEN cleansing conditioner. I use it as my only cleansing/shampoo and it works great. I have caucasion very fine curly hair which just loves to frizz and be unmanageable. I use the Co-wash the same way I used the WEN, I use a generous palm full and work though hair and add a little water to make it almost lather, I leave it in for a couple minutes then comb through with large tooth comb and leave in while I do the rest of my shower stuff, wash, shave, etc. rinse thoroughly and then i use about a dime size amount and work through hair for leave in conditioning and detangling. It is awesome. My hair is tangle free and managable without being frizzy and tangled. Without this type of product I would have to cut my hair short, with this stuff I can enjoy long hair that looks and feels great. I have found it for $7 at CVS and about $4 at Walmart. Not sure why the huge price here on Amazon though. Hopefully that is a mistake and it will come down.</li>
    <li> First of all let me say I tried this product last weekend.  I love it.  I&#x27;m trying to go natural and I love it.  It is good for those of you that also have a perm or color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;Second of all do yourselves and your wallet a favor and DON&#x27;T spend this ridiculous price of $19.37 for this product.  You can actually get it much cheaper in Walmart, or Target.  They both have it for around $4.99..nothing more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for the hair and I love it.  I have used Pantene products for many years and I never had any problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy...</li>
    <li> Great and fast service.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product pretty early on in my natural hair journey.  Then I discovered articles about sulfates and cones, blah blah blah and thought I was hurting my hair by using this product even though my hair had grown quickly.  I discontinued using this product for a year but just couldn&#x27;t find anything else that I liked as much so I&#x27;m back to using it.  In just  two washes, my hair is softer, shinier, less breakage and easier to detangle.  Love this stuff and don&#x27;t plan on stopping, this is definitely my staple cleansing product.  I wash once a month with sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
    <li> Silicon made this product fails</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this, and I love it!! My hair is quite long, 3a-b curls, (basically, my hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own, lol) and combing it through my wet hair in the shower is fabulous! I tried another co wash, liked it for a while, but this Pantene is amazing. I use it about twice a week, other days just rinse/condition. After I use this, I rinse well then apply a leave in mixed with gel and air dry. After my hair is completely dry, I kind of scrunch and slightly rake my hair and I&#x27;m happy! I can even pineapple my hair at night and get second day curls, those of you who follow curly girl methods can appreciate that!! The reviewer that said this didn&#x27;t work for caucasian hair is not entirely correct, cuz it works beautifully on my caucasian hair. Great stuff, reasonably priced, perfect!</li>
    <li> I love my new product! I&#x27;ve been natural for two years now and I really like how this works on my hair!</li>
    <li> I use the Tightly curly Method ( Co Washing and then applying ALOT Of Conditioner as my styling product.) This Cowash leaves my hair really soft especially When I follow up with the Pantene deep conditioner. My curls were Very defined and soft. I purchased this for 3.00 at Walmart. My texture is 3b3c.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, period.  If you have natural 4A-4C hair, this solves all the stressing about cowashing, breakage, and trying to make products at home (which, quiet as it&#x27;s kept, ain&#x27;t cheap and can be a crapshoot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a nice big bottle, so you can really treat your hair and not worry about the price - that IS, if you buy it elsewhere.  Love Amazon, but totally mystified as to why they&#x27;re charging over $18 when the street price of this is about nine or ten bucks.</li>
    <li> BUT, you can purchase this SAME BOTTLE at WalMart for $4.97(depending on your area).....not the price this seller is asking for. Just an F.Y.I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse and dry hair, and I bounce between Pantene Co-Wash, Diva Curl No-Poo, and Wen; and to me, my hair LOVES all three (WHOOOHOO). I just wanted to share the news ;)</li>
    <li> Great it as a detangler.</li>
    <li> This co-wash cleanser did everything I needed, and more.  Terrific slip, and a great clean.  I followed up with Tresseme Naturals conditioner, and my 3b/c hair was soft, clean, and perfect.  This will be my go to co-cleanser from here on out!</li>
    <li> I am a white girl with baby fine hair. This seems to be marketed to african american hair but worked great for me. I have baby fine color treated hair. It cleaned my hair and scalp deeply with no build up and the conditioning was light and balanced. I normally go for a deeper conditioning but it was good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Picked some up at the &amp;#34;red circle&amp;#34; store on sale to try it out.  Much better than the L-----l product and doesn&#x27;t have that cheap perfume smell.  I have ash blond very curly hair (gradually graying) and it looks better than it ever has. After the cowash, I always apply about 1-2 tsp of any  heavy conditioner and leave it in my hair.  Wish I had found out about the cowash option years ago.  I find products for African American hair work very well for me.  This product is so reasonable and I plan to try some of the other Pantene products in this line as soon as I use my old stuff up.</li>
    <li> My natural hair is a very thick mixture between a 3c and a 4a. Finding products that make it easier to take care of my hair is tough. I found this product at Target when looking for shampoo. I had never heard of co-wash though, for the first year I went natural I did only wash with conditioner so the idea was not new to me. Basically, this product is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did everything it claims, cleanses, moisturizes, and detangles. That last part was very important for me since my hair tends to become very matted within days if I&#x27;m not careful. With such thick hair, it&#x27;s difficult for me to manually detangle my hair. I&#x27;ve even had a hair stylist make me comb through my own hair to give her a break once when I went for a relaxer many years ago. This product was so good at detangling, that I only needed to do a once through before I was able to put it up to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisture level is on point! It left my hair feeling very soft and even smooth. I was able to put my super-thick hair back in a single afro puff without getting the frizzies on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Co-wash to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it was inexpensive and I used this brand when my hair was relaxed. It totally stripped my hair. I didn&#x27;t use a follow up conditioner because I wanted to evaluate its impact on my hair.  Never again....back to Eden or AsIAm coconut cowash products.</li>
    <li> I am caucasian with fine 2c/3a hair at BSL.  If you have coarse hair and want relaxed curls, this might work for you.  I have worked to coax my hair into tighter curls, without frizz, and this product stripped the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I love the smell.  I love the smell of all Pantene products.&lt;br /&gt;-The product cleanses the hair and adds slip.  However, it does rinse out clean if you rinse long enough.&lt;br /&gt;-It made my hair full and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The product made my hair almost straight.  I recommend CO-washing with Suave conditioner and using VO5 as a leave-in.  Or shampoo and use a light conditioner as a leave-in to get curls.  Also, Mane &#x27;n Tail Original conditioner works very well for curls as a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;-I left some of the product in as a leave-in - no extra curl and my hair was kind of dry.  You will need to condition after the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an alternative to WEN, Sally&#x27;s has a great one, Hair One.  They have several different ones in the line.  I use the Curly sometimes.</li>
    <li> My friend let me use this today at her house to do a cowash on my hair &amp; I really liked it. As I Am Coconut CoWash is my holy grail go to staple product for cowashing my hair but now this Pantene truly naturals will be my 2nd cowashing product even though it had silicones in it. It&#x27;s at Walmart for only $4.97 &amp; I will also purchase its deep conditioner for only $3.78!! As I Am Hydration Elation ismy holy grail deep conditioner as well but you can NEVER have too many shampoos, conditioners, cowashes &amp; deep conditioners in your house. I give this product a thumbs up because my hair was so soft in the process of using it &amp; it was VERY easy to finger detangle with!!</li>
    <li> Omg!!!! This has made hair washing fun again. I have very curly tangle prone natural hair and this product has saved me. I use to dread wash day, now it&#x27;s nothing. Love this</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, but Amazon has it entirely way to expensive.  I&#x27;m a military member, and I found this on Amazon; and I was about to purchase it.  But I went home for the holidays, so I decided to try Walmart to see if they carried the product.  OMG it was there, and they charged $5.99 per bottle.  I loved this stuff, I mailed myself a case back to the base.  I&#x27;ve shared this product with my fellow airmen, and we all love it.  I did the big chop when I went home for the holiday, and I have about a pretty big afro; since I transitioned for 10 months.  I love this stuff, it keeps my hair soooooooooooo soft and manageable, and it makes my curls pop. I even gave this stuff to my friend that has a relaxer, and she likes it a lot.  We can&#x27;t wait to get back to the states so we can stock up on this product, I hope they haven&#x27;t stopped stocking it at Walmart.  I just love Walmart, I wonder if they will send it to us overseas, if we place a large order; we are going to try.  I&#x27;ve requested that our BX get this stuff, but instead they got the As I Am product; wow it&#x27;s expensive as well.  I am so glade I got my Pantene, so I don&#x27;t have to purchase the AS I Am crap.  I say crap for a reason, my friend used up all the product I gave her, and she now uses the As I am stuff; she says Pantene is much_much_better.  I hope Walmart continues to stock this product, and please continue the $5.99 price.  I will purchase another case when I return home this summer.</li>
    <li> This left my daughter&#x27;s 4b natural hair dry and frizzy. Never using it again. I will look into the co-washes suggested by another reviewer. Mixed chicks shampoo, kinky curly come clean, and Aubrey organics never hurt our hair the way this Pantene co-wash did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: We realized the problem was the protein and silicone being high on the list. Our daughter&#x27;s hair has never seen heat or a texturizer, so her protein needs are minimal. We then assessed her hair for protein overload (Google: protein sensitive hair) and determined this was the issue. We sectioned her hair, cleansed with Kinky Curly Come Clean, did a diluted ACV rinse and added Eden Organics&#x27; Deep Conditioner and left that in for a few hours. Her hair is soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wouldn&#x27;t use this product again just because of our negative experience, if your hair needs protein this might be a suitable product for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for $5.50 at Family Dollar (it&#x27;s at other local stores too) so I have no idea why it&#x27;s so expensive here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have texlaxed/relaxed hair and wanted to try this product because my hair gets dry quite often. When co-washing with this my hair felt super soft and moisturized almost instantly. Even after using it a few days ago my hair still feels nice. I&#x27;m a fan of Pantene&#x27;s relaxed &amp; natural hair care line and I&#x27;m very pleased that they created this. Keep up the good work Pantene!</li>
    <li> This truly is a great conditioner!  Especially for me, as I have horrendously frizzy hair.  I have never found a product that seems to help.  However, this creme is great, smells amazing, and actually helps to tame my frizz.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I decided to give it a try.  But first let me tell you that I drove to 2 Walgreens, 2 Targets, 2 Walmarts and 1 CVS in my area before I found it!  All of the stores had the other Pantene natural hair products (conditioner, custard etc.) but they were all out of the co-wash except CVS (and CVS didn&#x27;t have many).  I figured it must be really good stuff since it is so hard to find.  So, I tried it yesterday and I really like it.  It works like other co-washes I&#x27;ve tried but the bonus for me is that it does a great job of detangling.  The others I have tried didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not as thick and heavy as other co-washes and I think I would prefer it to be heavier to help control this thick hair I have but the detangling properties make it a real winner for me.  I don&#x27;t really care for the fragrance.  It&#x27;s not bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell of natural ingredients.  It&#x27;s fragrance is rather strong and artificial instead.  I paid $6.99 for it at CVS.  MUCH less than here!  But it is good to know that if I can&#x27;t find it in my area it is available here.</li>
    <li> As a 4c natural its hard to find products that really  work, but I use this in the week and it really helps with detangling</li>
    <li> I love the product! I have used it once and my hair was so soft and manageable, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It was so easy to use and it detangled my hair and made it so easy to blow dry. I my hair feels so wonderful and not weighed down like many other shampoos and condition. I only had to use a small amount. I would recommend it to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> The use of word unmanageable in the product description turns me off. My natural hair is not unmanegable. NO THANKS</li>
    <li> I used Pantene when my hair was relaxed and loved it!  I am about 14 months into my transition to natural hair so needless to say I stopped using the for women of color line and switched to other products.  Because I had a great experience with Pantene in the past I decided to give their new cowash a try as a cheaper option to the As I Am co wash that I am currently using.  For me, I would definitely say that the As I Am co wash gets the 5 stars -- great smell, no tangles, soft/smooth hair and works great with my conditioners and oils that I use after co-washing.  The Pantene was good too, great smell and no tangles but I noticed my hair was not as soft as it usually is.  As it stands now I will continue to use the As I Am cowash to get the results that I am used to :-)</li>
    <li> I am 9 months transitioning and this makes my hair really soft. Detangling is easy as the comb slides right through. Smells great too</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use Wen,too. But for $5.00 at Walmart can not beat this. I brought the conditioner and I did not have to use it,because my hair stayed so moist. I just used aragan oil spray for extra shine and moisture. an Now it depends on the texture of your hair and how you take care of it,how any product works. My hair came out very soft and with curl definition. Will use this on a daily basis. I  am African American and have very soft and dry  hair ,and was having a difficult time finding something that gave me curls and moisture.Wen and Pantene Co-Wash did it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit on the fence about this one.  I&#x27;ve used Pantene in the past and liked it.  I acually use it now when I color my hair. The condish that comes with the hair  color is some AMAZING deep intense conditioner that my hair just loves. Anyway, I was actually looking for the intense conditioner and came across this one. I was nervous at first as it mentioned that it was a 3 in 1 product (cleans, conditions and seals). I just wasn&#x27;t sure how my hair was going to take to it and if it would strip my hair, although it said it wouldn&#x27;t.  The first time I used it, I thought it was ok, but i&#x27;ve continued to use it and I think I&#x27;m falling in love. My hair feels so thick and moisturized using this stuff. I don&#x27;t comb through my hair as i&#x27;m afraid of breakage when it is wet, but I am able to put this stuff in my hair and finger comb through it. The win for me is that I can put my Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie right on my hair (once the condish has been rinsed out) and it works!! My hair isn&#x27;t hard or crunchy (well, maybe from the CES and not the Pantene, LOL). I really like the way it makes my hair feel fuller. The product has oil in it, so i&#x27;m sure that is what&#x27;s helping. I want to also try their curl smoothie product  which they say gets better results the more one uses it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again....yea probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con:  the ingredients..YIKES. Some good stuff, but most of the &#x27;bad&#x27; stuff is up front in the ingredient list.</li>
</ol>
