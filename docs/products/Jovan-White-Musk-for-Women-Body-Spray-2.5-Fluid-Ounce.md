    <li> This product enhances the colon, I use them together.</li>
    <li> It has a soft smell that is very feminine. A little goes a long way withis product, but since it is a spray can it shoots out alot.</li>
    <li> Excellent price.  My daughter is a big fan of Jovan white musk and I was happy to be able to please her.,</li>
    <li> Spray is good but perfume is better and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Smell of spray disappates faster. Gets used up quicker but makes nice stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. Cost average for this type of product - and this one is hard to find in the store(s) where I live. .</li>
    <li> I really like it and so does my husband</li>
    <li> just what i always wear !</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive product. It makes you smell as if you just stepped out of a shower.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t have the same smell as the  cologne. I have allergies and can only wear very few Colognes white musk is one of the few and I really like it,  this is ok but not the same and my husband really don&#x27;t like this</li>
    <li> I sprayed Jovan White Musk Body Spray on my wrist, one of the places I usually spray my Jovan White Musk cologne. I noticed a difference in scent immediately and that difference remained as time passed. Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining things or that my body chemistry wasn&#x27;t causing the perceived difference, I also sprayed both the body spray and cologne on pieces of plastic. Once again, immediately I could tell the difference. The body spray smells more \\&quot;perfume-y\\&quot; than the cologne in my opinion. Since Jovan White Musk has been my signature fragrance for several years and this doesn&#x27;t quite smell the same, I will not buy it again.  I had ordered two.  One I will give to my granddaughter as part of her birthday present (she&#x27;s a \\&quot;tween\\&quot;who loves fragrances), the other I will give to my husband to sell in his store.  I also ordered the White Musk cologne concentrate.  I hope that turns out to be the true fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was suffering with bad odor underarms for a long time and this has resolved it. If I spray in the morning, the smell still lingers in the evening and there is no bad odor at all. Thank you ...thank you! I never though a body spray could resolve but trust me this is great!  This is not too strong nor too quick to go away.</li>
    <li> Not to heavy. Can use at work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with Jovan White Musk Body Spray. It is not the same&lt;br /&gt;scent as the Cologne. I purchased it on a whim, since the price was much cheaper than the Cologne. But, after two days I went back and bought a bottle of the Cologne spray. I will not be purchasing the Body Spray again!</li>
    <li> My favorite body spray and I get lots of compliments on the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  I get compliments all the time on the smell!</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this for Christmas a long time ago on accident. I had asked him for a different scent but he grabbed this one instead. I fell in love with it at first smell. I don&#x27;t buy any other scent now. I wear this in the witer because it has a heavier musk scent but isn&#x27;t over powering as some of the others that I have worn in the past. I highly recomend this to anybody that likes a musk for perfume.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents &amp; I really like the body spray.  It is not over bearing &amp; makes for a nice scent. Glad they still make this.</li>
    <li> Smells great.and it goes on dry.</li>
    <li> Love the white musk body spray by Jovan.  It is light and flowery, not over powering like perfume.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; scent loved it</li>
    <li> Use for bathroom spray</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like I remember. I loved this scent 20 years ago and I still love having this refreshing body spray for a quick pick me up.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, it is light and soft.</li>
