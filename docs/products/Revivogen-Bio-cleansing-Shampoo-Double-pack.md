<li> Highly recommended product to stop hair loss before it&#x27;s too late.</li>
<li> The only complaint that he has is that he has dry scalp from it.</li>
<li> do need a conditioner after using it because it does not rage out your hair like every other product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> However, I only usually use the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>

    <li> This shampoo works well on my hair: no dryness of dandruff. Don&#x27;t expect it&lt;br /&gt;to help grow your hair though. Also, wait for sales, as it is normally overpriced.</li>
    <li> Meet my  expectations</li>
    <li> It seems to work.  I have been using it for 3 months now and it seems I haven&#x27;t lost that much hair when I shampoo with Revivogen.  I am still waiting for optimal result.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be honest - I doubt any shampoo is going to grow hair back, but some might hinder it.&lt;br /&gt;If any shampoo could help - this would be the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this is the best shampoo I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I do need a conditioner after using it because it does not rage out your hair like every other product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years now. It is expensive, but a bottle last months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  do not get into the other Revivogen products - only use the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;They should repackage it for women in the high end saloon market - it is just a great shampoo and most of the high end stuff women buy is junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - whether you have hair loss or not</li>
    <li> Have used for years. I am a severe hair loss sufferer. Its gentle. I use nizoral and tgel too.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. It gives body to my hair without making it look oily. Considering that I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner or gel with it, it is definitely well worth the money. It works better than all the more expensive ones I have tried.</li>
    <li> It says it helps grow new hair on the scalp, but after using 2 bottles, I didn&#x27;t see any difference, and I haven&#x27;t bought any more.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. Just not sure if it&#x27;s helping my thinning hair as it implies it will. Smells great.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s hair has stopped falling out after using this product. The only complaint that he has is that he has dry scalp from it. Highly recommended product to stop hair loss before it&#x27;s too late.</li>
    <li> Love this product been using it for the past three years. Noticeable hair growth</li>
    <li> This was also a purchase resulted from huge positive reviews on amazon but disappointed totally. Such an expensive product should meet at least some expectations</li>
    <li> You only need a small amount to work up a good lather.  Smells great and is cooling to the scalp.</li>
    <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t grown back but it hasn&#x27;t receded or further thinned.  However, I only usually use the shampoo and conditioner.  I don&#x27;t usually put the solution on my scalp.  It does have a slight odor but I would only used that before bedtime for that reason.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo very good kind for my hair make my hair strong and tall</li>
    <li> Thin hair needs a good shampoo and this is one that is worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use a conditioner as it makes thin hair limp.&lt;br /&gt;Suggest Toppix gel (after shampooing) as it gives hair fluffiness and bounce.</li>
