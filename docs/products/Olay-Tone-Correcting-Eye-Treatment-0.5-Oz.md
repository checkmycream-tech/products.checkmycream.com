      <li>These products go on light and feel good.</li>
      <li>However, I was thrilled to find it at such a wonderful price on Amazon and bought 2.  </li>

      <li>I love Oil of Olay products and this one did not disappoint me.</li>
      <li>I like how it absorbs in my skin and makes the skin look more moisturized, but it does nothing to correct the shadow under my eye.</li>
      <li>Bacteria free!)</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love my OLay products</li>
      <li>Pleased with the price and the delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think puffy eyes are better repaired with plastic surgery.</li>
      <li>This really reduces fine lines and smells great.</li>
      <li>Love the many products which are available.  </li>
      <li>and this is the best deal I have found (other than clearance sales).</li>
      <li>I am knowing the product now, I hope the best results, it is soft, it is very soon to give my opinion.</li>
      <li>It smooths my eyelids and plumps the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I have two toddlers and am pregnant - no sleep!  </li>
      <li>It makes my eye area feel smooth.  </li>
      <li>Goes on light and isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for skin care.</li>
      <li>it is inexpensive and widely available.</li>
      <li>It feels so light after you rub it in.</li>
      <li>but it feels good and naturally highlights and brightens my eyes.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice significant results.</li>
      <li>On clean skin maybe, but it was still sticky.</li>
      <li>They feel good on my face , and hopefully are making me look years younger.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a good product, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>how the skin quickly absorbs it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It might be perfect if you only apply it to the upper lid.  </li>
      <li>I ordered it and quickly received it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for keeping away wrinkles around the eyes and minimizes dark circles under the eyes, even in the winter.  </li>
      <li>I have not been able to find it at any of the stores where I live and was considering purchasing it from the Oil of Olay website.  </li>
      <li>This is magic in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel often and this lid stays on, no worries, no mess, and wear it morning, and night.</li>
      <li>Also, it was a better price from Amazon than most other stores that carry it.</li>
      <li>It makes your dark undereye area bright again.</li>
      <li>It also seems more tacky, but I think that is due to the high volume of people touching it and using it and breathing all over it.  </li>
      <li>You really save a lot buying with Amazon!</li>
      <li>Now, for makeup - I will pay more - especially Mascara</li>
      <li>Goes on light and not heavy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I bought it and the jury is still out.</li>
      <li>suggest buying locally first to see how your skin reacts to make returning the product easier.</li>
      <li>This is better than my Lancome, or costly Saks cosmetic/ facial products eye creams, serums, or lotions.</li>
      <li>I just use a tiny dab and wait for it to perform its magic.</li>
      <li>I also love purchasing products from Amazon, they make it fast and simple.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it.  </li>
      <li>i really like this product</li>
      <li>It Was really really beat up.</li>
      <li>Cannot really say yet whether or not this product is helpful.  </li>
      <li>and I think it really does work.</li>
      <li>I really expected more from this product.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>You can really see the difference.</li>
      <li>so I am very cautious with all skin care</li>
      <li>Did not see much improvement for puffy eyes.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to the age correcting aspects</li>
      <li>I am told very often that I don&#x27;t look my age because I don&#x27;t have lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>very moisturixziing</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and it really works.</li>
      <li>I have shadows/little darkness under my right eye (ONLY my right eye,</li>
      <li>It has helped my dark circles (better than anything else).</li>
      <li>Dab on gently around eye area after your cleansing ritual, and for sensitive skin, wait  5 to 10 minutes after washing face to apply.</li>
      <li>I normally have to blend under my eyes again to get rid of the creasing under my eyes.</li>
      <li>I see results and this is my new Go-</li>
      <li>BUT with this product a little bit goes a long way and the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>it works just as good as over priced high end products in expensive department stores.</li>
      <li>do not consider myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>#34;Your skin looks so dewy, soft, and look SO young!&amp;#34</li>
      <li>So far I like this product.  </li>
      <li>I plan to continue to use it for at least 3 months to see if there is more improvement.</li>
      <li>now I had my 80th birthday this week &amp; everyone can not believe I am that old.</li>
      <li>Since I haven&#x27;t used this enough to know if it really does what it claims, I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Tried again next week to see if it was really the cream</li>
      <li>it has done wonders for my face specially around my eye area,no more dark circles I&#x27;am in Love,just try it!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I looked like I had sat out in the full sun for a few hours without sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I never really used it much since there was something about it that I did not like.</li>
      <li>But as far as my initial response, I like the way it feels and it seems to tighten up the area.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wanted to try this.</li>
    <li> So it is not a miracle worker but I did see a difference around my eyes. I liked it because I can put it on my eyelids. Its not greasy! It absorbs very easily into my skin. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream.  You only need a little.  Goes on light and not heavy or greasy.  Lasts a long time.  My eyes seem less droopy and puffy when I use this product.  Would definitely recommend this product. Also, it was a better price from Amazon than most other stores that carry it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and some high-end, pricey eye creams can actually result in my eye area turning lobster red so I am very cautious with all skin care purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This swirly, silky eye treatment comes out of a pump (you never want to dip your fingers in jars to apply to face as the hands have bacteria and I always buy pumps for my beauty products or use a tiny plastic cream scoop spoon to apply. Bacteria free!) This is better than my Lancome, or costly Saks cosmetic/ facial products eye creams, serums, or lotions. This is magic in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel often and this lid stays on, no worries, no mess, and wear it morning, and night. Your eye makeup will not smudge, smear like other greasy eye treatments. Dab on gently around eye area after your cleansing ritual, and for sensitive skin, wait  5 to 10 minutes after washing face to apply. I see results and this is my new Go-To Eye treatment~ I go to nail spa, and get my eyebrows waxed regularly and my tech said &amp;#34;Your skin looks so dewy, soft, and look SO young!&amp;#34; This is the secret~ and men, it works for you, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine it with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Tone Correcting Night Moisturizer and you will see a noticeable difference in your skin tone, complexion, and softness. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I do not like it....it leaves a residue of sticky white substance.</li>
    <li> I usually like Oil of Olay except I don&#x27;t see much happening with this product. I won&#x27;t buy this 1 again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now I had my 80th birthday this week &amp; everyone can not believe I am that old.&amp; I believe it is because I have  been using these products Jean Jones</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I don&#x27;t have the energy to put on makeup.  But since I have to put on face moisturizer, this takes care of the extra step I don&#x27;t have to do, and I have a thin foundation on!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a week and can see a difference-skin is smoother and softer!</li>
    <li> Goes on light and isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for skin care. Similar products are 70 dollars and up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best eye treatment. I would buy it if it were on clearance though. Other than that, I would pass.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it really works. My family notice the deference after two weeks. I do&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it</li>
    <li> I love olay products, as I have never been disappointed with anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. Sometimes I stray, but usually find my way back to olay. I think this is a good product, especially for the price. It keeps the area around my eyes hydrated. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle eye cream, (but who has?) and I haven&#x27;t found anything else that I&#x27;ve liked better. I trust olay and will continue to use their products.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well and for the price - I will stick with this one and not pay $82 ever again.  anything I have bought frmo this brand has been good value.  Hard to justify the expensive brands for treatment products.  Now, for makeup - I will pay more - especially Mascara</li>
    <li> As for correction I am not sure about anything.  It might be perfect if you only apply it to the upper lid.  Each star is for each upper lid of the eye area.  As for other areas of the eye I would stay away from this product due to the high pearl content.  It is extremely shiny.  Maybe I have made a hasty decision.  It also seems more tacky, but I think that is due to the high volume of people touching it and using it and breathing all over it.  Use it out side.</li>
    <li> This eye cream has a shinny residue and it emphasizes eye wrinkles .It is not a good product , I didn&#x27;t like it at all .</li>
    <li> This eye cream goes on very smoothly.  It makes my eye area feel smooth.  I like the way it feels, looks, and stays on.</li>
    <li> it has done wonders for my face specially around my eye area,no more dark circles I&#x27;am in Love,just try it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  It&#x27;s great for keeping away wrinkles around the eyes and minimizes dark circles under the eyes, even in the winter.  Women of all ages can benefit from its use.</li>
    <li> Cannot really say yet whether or not this product is helpful.  This is the first time I bought it and the jury is still out.</li>
    <li> I like the product. I don&#x27;t notice significant results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for quite a while and I think it really does work. I am told very often that I don&#x27;t look my age because I don&#x27;t have lines around my eyes. I would recommend this. It goes on easily&#x27; not oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> I am knowing the product now, I hope the best results, it is soft, it is very soon to give my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few of the Olay products and I do not care for any of them. Leave a sticky feeling on the skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any changes and it seemed to irritate my skin at my cheek bones.</li>
    <li> Pleased with the price and the delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed with the condition of the actual product box with the product was on. It Was really really beat up. I purchased this, as a gift for a friend overseas, but it looks like I shoplifted it.</li>
    <li> I use this as an eye gel and brow bone highlighter instead of eye shadow. I can&#x27;t really speak to the age correcting aspects but it feels good and naturally highlights and brightens my eyes. (I wouldn&#x27;t use it underneath my eyes during the day, as it would highlight darkspots)</li>
    <li> I do not have an issue with my eyes, needing correction, so this is not something I would every use,</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> My eyes look great every morning!  I have two toddlers and am pregnant - no sleep!  You&#x27;d never know it looking at my eyes!</li>
    <li> Softens skin under eye.  Did not see much improvement for puffy eyes.  I think puffy eyes are better repaired with plastic surgery.</li>
    <li> I like this product...I have noticed a difference in the last couple weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> Have made my eyes look younger since I started using and I do not use everyday.  A lot of my lines have disappeared.  Love my OLay products</li>
    <li> I started using this product because I found it in my bathroom. It belonged to my spouse. They weren&#x27;t using it. So after a year I decided to give it a try. It feels so light after you rub it in. It makes your dark undereye area bright again. I really like this product. I decided to buy it on Amazon because when I went to the store to get another it was like $24. You really save a lot buying with Amazon! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some difference under my eyes. Still waiting to see if it creates a big difference. But It did come before the arrival date, which I was happy about.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for older skin that is showing wrinkles</li>
    <li> Disappointed, did nothing for dark circles or puffiness. Actually, it highlighted them.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just what I need to moisturize my under eyes and brighten them a little.  Yes, there is a little shimmer in the product, but I have no idea how much you would have to be using to have it be noticeable.  I use about half a pea size for each eye and don&#x27;t think it is all that shimmery, shiny.  It also works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> I bought this the other day from the store that starts with a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34;. I am an Olay fan and thought I&#x27;d try this &amp;#34;new-to-me&amp;#34; product. My eye lids swelled up horribly. This essentially gave my eyelids a flash burn and turned them red - looks like a sunburn. I will be returning this product to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not consider myself to have sensitive skin. Additionally, the Olay CC Tone Correcting product for the face had the same results, minus any swelling. I looked like I had sat out in the full sun for a few hours without sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest buying locally first to see how your skin reacts to make returning the product easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month - no noticeable effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t reduce wrinkles/fine lines nor did it help lighten up the dark circles. However, I do like the texture of it and how the skin quickly absorbs it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the next eye cream!</li>
    <li> Applied at night and woke up in the morning with red, bleary eyes. It took a few days of no application for them to clear up. Tried again next week to see if it was really the cream and it happened again...never touched it since.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a while and have used it randomly at night. I never really used it much since there was something about it that I did not like. I finally decided to use it today under my makeup which I have not done. I realize now why I never use it. It leaves a sticky residue under my eyes and midday I normally have to blend under my eyes again to get rid of the creasing under my eyes. I tried to do this now and my makeup and this cream started to roll up under my eyes! Ugh I am so mad cause I don&#x27;t have makeup to touch up so I have to leave my under eyes a mess. I will NOT be using this again especially in the day or night If I have to go somewhere. On clean skin maybe, but it was still sticky. It makes me feel like a flytrap since it is so gummy and sticky. I just looked again and it is a crumbly mess. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD CARE OF SELLER. I RECOMMEND 100%</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchase this product. It smooths my eyelids and plumps the fine lines around my eyes. I recommend this product. You can really see the difference.</li>
    <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes. This product has lessened the darkness. I just use a tiny dab and wait for it to perform its magic.</li>
    <li> I just began using the Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Tone Correcting Eye Treatment but have seen some results already.  I plan to continue to use it for at least 3 months to see if there is more improvement.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews saying there&#x27;s people breathing on it and that you should use it outside...maybe it&#x27;s a language thing. anyway this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay products and this one did not disappoint me. I did see an improvement in the dark under my eyes. These products go on light and feel good.</li>
    <li> i am a huge fan of oil of olay, this is just another great product they offer! it is inexpensive and widely available. it works just as good as over priced high end products in expensive department stores.I also love purchasing products from Amazon, they make it fast and simple. Very satisfied customer here!!</li>
    <li> Great deal on a great product.  I have been using this for several years now and this is the best deal I have found (other than clearance sales).</li>
    <li> I am all for any product that can help me get out of the house quicker in the morning and this one does the trick- I look at it as a serum and eye cream all in one and like the way it makes my undereye look. very moisturixziing however I do not look like my undereye are is wet- I will definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> I really expected more from this product. I have shadows/little darkness under my right eye (ONLY my right eye, weird, I know right?) and I was hoping this would correct the under-eye darkness. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month, every night, and I have seen very, very little difference. I like how it absorbs in my skin and makes the skin look more moisturized, but it does nothing to correct the shadow under my eye. I will try something different and see if it helps.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful treatment for the skin around your eyes to keep it smooth and soft. It also adds a slight bit of color to help mask lines.</li>
    <li> Since I haven&#x27;t used this enough to know if it really does what it claims, I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars. But as far as my initial response, I like the way it feels and it seems to tighten up the area.</li>
    <li> This really reduces fine lines and smells great. I love all the Olay 7-in-1 products, they leave my skin feeling and smelling great.</li>
    <li> i really like this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sticky and too shimmery. You have to rub/pat it in a lot or it&#x27;ll just flake/rub off! I feel like it&#x27;s been making the skin around my eyes darker which is horrible. Not recommended. Doesn&#x27;t seem to actually correct skin tone but make it worse and it&#x27;s just like a gross highlight for around your eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it.  I have not been able to find it at any of the stores where I live and was considering purchasing it from the Oil of Olay website.  However, I was thrilled to find it at such a wonderful price on Amazon and bought 2.  The speed of delivery was wonderful and I&#x27;m very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> This Olay eye cream is my fave.  It&#x27;s lightweight and great for daytime use.  I had trouble finding it locally and counted on Amazon having it.  No problem-I ordered it and quickly received it.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help wrinkles or cross feet. Didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> Have been using Olay for 30 years. Love the many products which are available.  They feel good on my face , and hopefully are making me look years younger.  Have wandered away time after time to try others and always come back to Olay!</li>
    <li> The Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Tone Correcting Eye Treatment is amazing. Yes, it&#x27;s a little bit pricy considering it&#x27;s only 0.5 Ounce BUT with this product a little bit goes a long way and the results are amazing. A must have on your skin care routine.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product.  I wonder about the dispenser for the eye treatment as it seems a bit complicated for applying the cream.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day. Just a little does the trick. It has helped my dark circles (better than anything else).</li>
