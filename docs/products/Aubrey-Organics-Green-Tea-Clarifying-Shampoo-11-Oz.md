      <li>and I love how it makes my scalp feel.</li>
      <li>in keeping with the tradition of outstanding products from this manufacturer,&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a clarifying shampoo should not be used more than once or twice a week.  </li>
      <li>It is also runny, but I love the results.  </li>
      <li>Either my hair is 100x more oily than everyone else, or they are all lying.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more when this bottle runs out.</li>
      <li>(Maybe my scalp is just producing more oil these days.)  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s gets out most of it, but</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite Aubrey Organics shampoos (which I follow with the matching cream rinse).  </li>
      <li>I never use conditioner... because it just greases up my scalp even more, worsening the problem.</li>
      <li>I love EO&#x27;s volumizing shampoo.</li>
      <li>I alternate shampoos on a weekly basis because that seems to work best on my hair.  </li>
      <li>one more time&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I used a lot, and my hair just feels more oily.</li>

      <li>Love how light my hair feels after I wash w this shampoo!</li>
      <li>My hair and scalp feels &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, and the fragrance is a pleasant clean smell.  </li>
      <li>I love the herbal smell &amp; how it makes my hair nice &amp; shiny &amp; clean.</li>
      <li>truly is a super nice clarifying</li>
      <li>one of whom I was quickly becoming.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special.</li>
      <li>I have fine oily hair and this shampoo is fantastic.</li>
      <li>and you have to try first to find out if it is suitable for your scalp and</li>
      <li>AO Green Tea Clarifying Shampoo is yet &#x27;another&#x27; great Aubrey Organic&#x27;s product!</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it does a great job on my fine but fluffy mane.  </li>
      <li>clean</li>
      <li>I want it to feel clean.</li>
      <li>I found this one years ago, and loved it because it left my scalp and hair feeling clean and light.  </li>
      <li>The smell is a neutral clean smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>It will leave your hair squeaky clean, it does feel somewhat stripping</li>
      <li>/&gt;Looks clean and not oily.</li>
      <li>It gets my hair feeling clean with one washing</li>
      <li>Hair is squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>I always feel clean and refreshed after using this shampoo.</li>
      <li>is lasting me a good while</li>
      <li>But seriously it&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>I have fine but naturally curly graying hair which with most shampoos will frizz.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that it lathers best when I rub it in my hands and then work it through my hair starting at the roots and working down, adding more water as needed.</li>
      <li>other than that this product is way more effective than anything I have gotten at the salon or mass merchandiser.</li>
      <li>I really liked the old version and particularly the way it smelled: very mild and generically shampooy.  </li>
      <li>The Green Tea shampoo works well on oily hair or flaky scalps and has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
      <li>If your hair is super oily, the green tea shampoo is a great choice.  </li>
      <li>But the picture on the advertisement showed the old Scent free and chemical free bottle.</li>
      <li>This stuff is worth a shot for anyone, and it is a Godsend if your hair is anything like mine.   </li>
      <li>I also love the all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>and it was soooo worth it.  </li>
      <li>Much better results than the many other clarifying shampoos I have tried.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to try a more healthy and natural shampoo.</li>
      <li>and it seems to do a great job of removing the excessive oil from my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>The scent is not unpleasant and I love the way it does not suds up like most shampoos I had used in the past.  </li>
      <li>It has a soft, fresh, pleasant scent, and you don&#x27;t have to use very much (even with long hair).  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just less good.  </li>
      <li>My scalp is healthier, I have less dandruff, it does a great job of moisturizing my hair, and I&#x27;m not slowly poisoning my body.</li>
      <li>Very highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Ive tried eight different volumizing natural shampoos and this is by far the most effective.</li>
      <li>Also, my hair now goes an astonishing two full days of being free of grease - nearly twice as long as before!   </li>
      <li>Green tea is amazing and is finding itself in more and more uses other than a drink.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Note the same product the package and ingredients are different then it show.</li>
    <li> I have used this on &amp; off for years. I love the herbal smell &amp; how it makes my hair nice &amp; shiny &amp; clean. I also love the all natural ingredients. The only thing I am not crazy about is the thick consistency. It comes out of the bottle runny, but it is actually thick, almost like a concentrate, where I have to keep adding water to make it lather well. This is a small matter, though. I will probably buy this again in the future. I alternate between this &amp; Desert Essence Lemon/tea tree shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I have fine but naturally curly graying hair which with most shampoos will frizz.  After multiple uses I have not once had frizz to be an issue. The scent is not unpleasant and I love the way it does not suds up like most shampoos I had used in the past.  I apply it to my wet hair and rub it in, leaving it to soak in for a few minutes.  It rinses completely and leaves my hair manageable and soft.  I know it can be used with conditioners as well; though at this time I have not found a reason to use anything but the shampoo itself.  Definitely on my list of products I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Aubrey Organics shampoos (which I follow with the matching cream rinse).  It says it&#x27;s for oily hair, but I think it works with any type of hair.  I don&#x27;t have particularly oily hair, and I usually use the moisturizing types, but this works great &amp; leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  Other people I know with oily hair have great results with it as well.  It has a soft, fresh, pleasant scent, and you don&#x27;t have to use very much (even with long hair).  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have fine oily hair and this shampoo is fantastic. It gets my hair feeling clean with one washing and it seems to do a great job of removing the excessive oil from my hair and scalp. I think it lathers very well and had no trouble getting used to it. I plan to continue using this shampoo. It&#x27;s the best shampoo I have found so far to use with my fine oily hair. Much better results than the many other clarifying shampoos I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have had oily hair all my life, and finding a shampoo that gets rid of all the oil, without stripping it completely has been difficult.  Aubrey Organics Green Tea Shampoo is more of a liquid and less like other shampoo, but it works for my oily hair, whether long or short hair.  I also recommend the corresponding Green tea cream rinse.  It is also runny, but I love the results.  Most of Aubrey Organics shampoos and conditioners are thicker, this is the only product I have found to be different.  But it works great!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking a long time for a shampoo that can deal with my hair.  Non-organic shampoos left my scalp extremely oily, but my biggest problem were these annoying pimple-like sores on my head. I had them for YEARS, and though I switched shampoos often, I could never get rid of them.  As soon as I tried organic remedies, however, the gross, annoying sores disappeared.  I used baking soda for a while, but needless to say that got old pretty fast. I finally decided to pay a bit more than I was used to for real organic shampoo and it was soooo worth it.  Aubrey&#x27;s is awesome.  It&#x27;s not your typical shampoo and it&#x27;s not supposed to be!  I know from my scalp issue that ORGANIC MATTERS.  Once you get used to organic shampoos you will never go back.  If your hair is super oily, the green tea shampoo is a great choice.  It clarifies without harshness and I can go more than 24 hours without washing my hair, FINALLY!</li>
    <li> I did not get the desired result--hair still felt oily.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair more oily than other shampoos. I stoped using it and bought a different shampoo which is working much better than this one.</li>
    <li> is lasting me a good while and I love how it makes my scalp feel. will order again.</li>
    <li> A while back I decided it would be smart to move over to an organic shampoo that didn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients such as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in it. This is the company that was recommended to me and I just picked out the green tea one at the store. After going through three bottles of it I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s easily the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used. My scalp is healthier, I have less dandruff, it does a great job of moisturizing my hair, and I&#x27;m not slowly poisoning my body. It&#x27;s an oily shampoo, which I prefer because it is easier to wash out thoroughly even though I have extremely thick hair. The smell is a neutral clean smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I always feel clean and refreshed after using this shampoo. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to try a more healthy and natural shampoo.</li>
    <li> Worked very well on my Daughters greasy hair.I will be ordering more when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> Yep. The formula change is a serious bummer. This was the only shampoo I could tolerate that worked well on my hair, and now with the new ingredients I can&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m considering calling Aubrey to beg them to change the formula back. Not that they would, but just as protest.</li>
    <li> I am a young, adult male who has a naturally high hairline and VERY oily hair. These two factors combined can give the appearance of male AGA (balding)- even though I know I don&#x27;t have it. I never use conditioner... because it just greases up my scalp even more, worsening the problem. Just one day after showering and using only shampoo, my hair would be as greasy as ever, and consequently become thin and brittle.   I don&#x27;t usually buy into \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; products. Unfortunately for me, the market for my little problem is flooded with them, thanks to masses of paranoid men with thinning hair- one of whom I was quickly becoming. After a little browsing, I decided to buy this stuff because: A- It&#x27;s organic.  B- It has good reviews.  And C: It doesn&#x27;t claim to do anything amazing.   I didn&#x27;t like it at first. The consistency and color is more like maple syrup than shampoo, and, for a short while, it left a crusty feeling in my hair when I would rinse.  However...  Usually after a shower, I would brush my hair, only to reveal a comb PACKED full of hairs, despite what shampoo I was using, or whether I even shampooed. I tried to ignore this, because everyone told me that this amount of hair loss was normal. It wasn&#x27;t. After only my second use of this shampoo, I have noticed far, far fewer hairs ensnared in the comb. Almost none, in fact. This stuff actually does \\&quot;strengthen\\&quot; your hair to some degree, I am shocked to say. Also, my hair now goes an astonishing two full days of being free of grease - nearly twice as long as before!   I never really cared about my hair- or even brushed it- until fairly recently, so I never really bothered to look for the right shampoo for my type of hair. Finally, I&#x27;ve found it, and I can put my scalp worries behind me. This stuff is worth a shot for anyone, and it is a Godsend if your hair is anything like mine.   Buy it now!</li>
    <li> This is not a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shampoo, at least in my opinion. It has an oil-like consistency, in a clear, green-tea color. It&#x27;s hard to hold it in the palms and work up the lather. And this shampoo just doesn&#x27;t lather well. I really have to add water little by little (even though the hair is already wet) and really take the time to work up the lather. And in the process I&#x27;ve got my hair all tangled with the constant rubbing-motion. Not the best thing to do for long thick hair. However, after rinsing, the hair does become noticeably softer. I still need to apply de-tangling product before I can comb through the hair, but the hair seems moisturized, so I guess the product does its job. No fragrance- just a natural, tree-oil-like smell. I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times so far. Will finish the bottle but probably not buy it again or recommend it to anyone with long hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel like straw...continued to try it for a week hoping it would improve but finally gave up :(</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to replace a green tea shampoo i bought in Asia.  This does a great job, but it&#x27;s not as good as my old shampoo.  i have oily hair and scalp and it&#x27;s gets out most of it, but my old shampoo really got it all. it&#x27;s really watery so it&#x27;s hard to get the right amount out of the bottle.  I poured it into the old shampoo bottle which had a pump.  This makes it easier to get into my hands.  I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo because it gets your hair clean without the use of nasty chemicals and artificial fragrance. I love the way it lathers and the scent is nice, too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect any of the Aubrey Organics to lather much or feel like a normal shampoo, because ITS CHEMICALS THAT FOAM AND CREATE LATHER.  These products are 100% natural.</li>
    <li> My fave shampoos! Love how light my hair feels after I wash w this shampoo! But it does strip color because its a claryfying shampoo....however, if that&#x27;s not a concern, just use a reparative conditioner to replenish lost nutrients. Definitely a staple in my bathroom!</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite shampoo!</li>
    <li> It was okay, and very surprising to me at first. I thought it was gonna be like a regular shampoo, but it&#x27;s liquid. It also cleaned my hair to the point of it becoming very dry, but I guess that means that it truly is clarifying.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for finer, oily prone hair.</li>
    <li> I feel like this stuff didn&#x27;t do anything. I used a lot, and my hair just feels more oily. It feels as though I just rinsed my hair with water. If I run my hand through my hair, I feel like I need to wash my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps these are my head&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural oils&amp;#34; and Aubrey is doing me a favor by not stripping them. But I got this shampoo because I don&#x27;t like my hair&#x27;s natural oils. I want it to feel clean. This product did not make my hair feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all these amazing reviews, and I am dumbfounded. Either my hair is 100x more oily than everyone else, or they are all lying.</li>
    <li> This shampoo worked so well, got rid of my oily hair in just one day! I had tried other brands before that had not helped.</li>
    <li> The old version I gave 5 stars (in my mind).  But some time around 2011 or &#x27;12, the company tinkered with it and changed the ingredients.  I don&#x27;t have an older bottle for comparison but I&#x27;m sure that there are new ingredients and these new ingredients do nothing to improve it and in fact I think actually make it worse.  (Maybe my scalp is just producing more oil these days.)  I really liked the old version and particularly the way it smelled: very mild and generically shampooy.  Which was perfect!  Now it&#x27;s fancier and perfumier.  Like something Rose on \\&quot;Titanic\\&quot; might&#x27;ve used to wash her hair.  But seriously it&#x27;s not bad it&#x27;s just less good.  Will try something else next time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works exactly as it is intended to. My hair is no longer oily and I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often as I used to.</li>
    <li> Ive tried eight different volumizing natural shampoos and this is by far the most effective. The shampoo that comes in second is EO&#x27;s volumizing shampoo. They BOTH are very effective though. I love EO&#x27;s volumizing shampoo. The reason why I prefer this one is the shampoo keeps my hair less oily for just a day longer (not that big of a difference, but still its convenient). I also love how it smells and the fact it has matcha green tea and ginseng!! :) I drink matcha tra every day and simply love the idea I am  putting it on my scalp. So its purely a preference of esthetics. Also this shampoo lasts longer per ounce. I only have to use a little bit. That being said for shoulder length hair, use a quarter size amount (MAX) wipe it onto hair scalp THEN lather. It wont lather immediately but when it starts to lather, ITS SUUUPER lathery. I usually shampoo the top of head and to my ears first then rinse then shampoo again on the back side of my head wiping the shampoo on my hair under the rest of hair (if that makes sense) then start to scrub. Rinse and then shampoo my whole head one more time&lt;br /&gt;If necessary with a little less of amount of shampoo. ***ALSO i use apple cider vinegar (ACV) to rinse my hair after rinsing out the shampoo. I use ACV INSTEAD of conditioner. It makes a big difference for fine, oily hair and makes my hair bouncy. No conditioner necessary! I swear! The combo of this shampoo with ACV rinse is awesome! Also because i dont use conditioner anymore, i apend a little less and it justifies for me paying a little more for this product.</li>
    <li> It suits this old gray head!  Hair is squeaky clean.  Green tea is amazing and is finding itself in more and more uses other than a drink.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula. But the picture on the advertisement showed the old Scent free and chemical free bottle. Then they shipped the new stuff.  The reason we were using it was to avoid scent and some of the chemicals in  most shampoos.  So it was very disappointing to get something we can&#x27;t use</li>
    <li> If you are trying Aubrey&#x27;s for the first time, you have to be open minded.  It is not like a conventional shampoo.  The first day I used it, I was wincing through the whole shampoo and cream rinse experience.  The shampoo is thinner than conventional shampoos and doesn&#x27;t lather like conventional shampoos.  The cream rinse is very \\&quot;watery\\&quot; as well.  Goes on very differently than conventional conditioners.  That being said - my hair comes out great every day.  It feels and looks a lot healthier and when I style it, it doesn&#x27;t look flat by mid afternoon.  It looks great all day.  I feel good recommending this product...not only is it all natural and free of harsh chemicals, but I feel it works very well to keep hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Seriously saved my life. Shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell good but works great for greasy hair. My hair feels normal and is no longer greasy. Ofcourse my hair gets greasy occasionally but this shampoo increases the amount of time hair&lt;br /&gt;Looks clean and not oily.</li>
    <li> This works great if you use it correctly.  As a clarifying shampoo should not be used more than once or twice a week.  If use daily, you can lose a LOT of hair.  Be careful!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! The clean scent that&#x27;s not overwhelming. The natural ingredients. The feeling of my hair after I use it (and the corresponding cream rinse). The fact that I use less of it than regular shampoo.     Now, it does take some getting used to. It doesn&#x27;t lather like regular shampoo, and I&#x27;ve had to modify how I wash my hair to match. I&#x27;ve found that it lathers best when I rub it in my hands and then work it through my hair starting at the roots and working down, adding more water as needed. After rinsing it out, my hair feels clean but not squeaky or too dried out.     My hair tangles easily, so I always follow with a conditioner or cream rinse - I like the corresponding Green Tea Cream Rinse, and it just takes a little bit to de-tangle using the same method of spreading it through my hair.     I was skeptical at first, since it&#x27;s more expensive in a smaller bottle than the stuff I was using, but now I&#x27;m hooked! Regular shampoos smell too &#x27;chemically&#x27; to me now.</li>
    <li> The shampoo cleanses the hair well, and leaves no residue, and does not dry out the hair. Perfect for washing dreadlocks , locs, because it clarifies, leaves hair shiny.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best clarifying shampoo!  My hair and scalp feels &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean, and the fragrance is a pleasant clean smell.  A little goes a long way, I mix it with water in my hands before I apply it, because it is so concentrated.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  They changed the formula.  I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but I run into this often with organic shampoos.  I found this one years ago, and loved it because it left my scalp and hair feeling clean and light.  Now, with the drastically revised formula, it feel like my hair is matted together and has no bounce, the ends feel dry but my scalp and half of my hair feels oily at the same time.  I hate it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful aroma...mandarin orange.  Leaves hair feeling soft and clean.i</li>
    <li> I think it is misleading to read the reviews and see that this product has 4 stars when many of the reviews listed are not for this specific green tea shampoo but are for many different Aubrey shampoos. i am hopeful that maybe I will find a different type that will be the right match for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious to know what the rating is for this specific shampoo? I wonder how unusual my experience was because it is hard for me to believe that most did not experience the same thing. This shampoo is very watery. It is hard to use when you try to squeeze it out, it is so watery that so much gets wasted and falls thru your hands. I have to give one star for a wonderful clean herbal smell, very luxurious spa-ike smell. Also I give them credit that the product is pretty \\&quot; clean\\&quot; in a sense of organic and natural ingredients. However it is so hard for me to believe this works for anyone. I imagine it does work for some people who have a specific hair type but I am still pretty skeptical. The shampoo is not only watery, but it does not foam. I rinsed it in my hair over and over about 3 or more times and it just made my hair heavy and oily. It did not feel like it had any detergents that were cleaning it, just oils. I followed with a little of the Aubrey conditioner. The next time I tried not using any conditioner at all and just the green tea shampoo, it was still super oily. I mean really oily , oiler then before I washed it. Now I have to toss this in the trash, and I hate doing that. I don&#x27;t know why this shampoo calls itself clarifying and also on the side of the bottle it says \\&quot; oily\\&quot; . I thought it meant for oily hair, but now I think what they mean is this shampoo makes your hair oily.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST clarifying shampoo ever!!! Very highly recommended! It will leave your hair squeaky clean, it does feel somewhat stripping but then again it is meant to clear your hair of all product.</li>
    <li> I believe the best shampoo for oily hair I have tried so far! I don&#x27;t use it daily afraid to over dry my hair. Yet the cleansing is deep and hair last clean longer than other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I decided to add this after reading several negative reviews stating the lack of suds and oily hair after washing issues.  The directions say SHAKE WELL, that means just before you use it!  This does not have the ingredients that the drugstore brands use to prevent separation.  If you do not shake it well before you apply you&#x27;re getting only a portion of the ingredients that rise to the top, and NO, it won&#x27;t work.  I have thick, fine, color treated hair that goes from oily to dry on a whim of it&#x27;s own and this shampoo is perfect when the oily part starts.  I alternate shampoos on a weekly basis because that seems to work best on my hair.  This product cleans my scalp and makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter for her oily hair. It smells good and helps with her hair.</li>
    <li> The Green Tea shampoo works well on oily hair or flaky scalps and has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s not too strong. It&#x27;s a good alternative if you use the Swimmer&#x27;s Shampoo in the summer. (If you have really serious dandruff, you want the Calaguala shampoo.) Green Tea shampoo is NOT for dry hair! If your hair is fine and dry, you want Blue Chamomile shampoo or Rosa Mosqueta.</li>
    <li> this is a great shampoo, just one lather up and rinse.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well for oily hair. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it is much better than anything I found at the store. Make sure you let it sit in your hair for a few minutes, that seems to help.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special. Probably not worth the inflated price. I prefer the old Nature&#x27;s Gate product, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be made anymore.</li>
    <li> What can I say,&lt;br /&gt;other than I. LIKE. It... !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in keeping with the tradition of outstanding products from this manufacturer,&lt;br /&gt;The AO Green Tea Clarifying Shampoo is yet &#x27;another&#x27; great Aubrey Organic&#x27;s product! I like to use this&lt;br /&gt;when I am not using my homemade shampoo that I make from my African Black Soap&lt;br /&gt;(see my Natural-Cosmetics&#x27; Raw Handmade African Black Soap review)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;AO&#x27; Green Tea Clarifying Shampoo gently cleanses and removes any excess buildup and residue from products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it makes a very nice addition to anyone&#x27;s hair-care product pantry and regimen.&lt;br /&gt;For best results, use every 5th or 6th shampoo. Or if your hair is just really feeling over-producty in general...&lt;br /&gt;This truly is a super nice clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our grade: B++ / 4.5-Stars!</li>
    <li> I dont recommend using this shampoo daily, use it weekly and get another shampoo daily or else your hair may become too dry. It really does get rid of the excess oil, great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo to get out all of the oil in your hair. Gentle enough to use everyday without frizzies. It only takes a dab, and you get the squeaky clean you crave. I was sold after the first use.</li>
    <li> I have a combination of dry, often itchy scalp and greasy hair that makes it extremely difficult to find a shampoo to address both issues.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried countless brands, both brand names and drugstore products,and&lt;br /&gt;so far I have  found the Aussie Cleanse and Mend to work relatively good for me, without making my scalp itchy or weighting my hair down after wash.&lt;br /&gt;After having conducted extensive research and reading the rave reviews on Aubrey Green Tea Clarifying Shampoo,I decided to invest in this product.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, not only did not do anything for me, but I can say it is one of the worst shampoos I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It is supposedly  for greasy hair, yet whilst washing my hair, my hair felt really heavy, greasy and sort of unpleasantly clammy , like when you rub etheric oils into it.&lt;br /&gt;It was impossible to comb my hair in the shower and even after applying generous ammount of conditioner, was still feeling very clammy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Once I blowdried my hair, my hair looked  bouncy,shiny and full of texture and  volume; but the next day I had the biggest dandruff flakes I&#x27;ve ever had and my hair looked and felt really dirty and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I could not wait to wash my hair with my regular shampoo and feel fresh and clean again.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is just my hair type as it seem to have worked for the most customers, but the ingredients inside this shampoo made my hair even greasier,I suppose because of the oils it is infused with.&lt;br /&gt;Finding a shampoo that works for you  is very personal choice and you have to try first to find out if it is suitable for your scalp and hair;unfortunately in my case this shampoo  ended up as toilet gel cleaner.</li>
    <li> while this shampoo does make my hair (which is very oily) clean I am still having to wash it everyday. The shampoo is very watery but it does lather up very well. Bad thing is that is tangles my hair up sooo bad and leaves it feeling rough.</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful I don&#x27;t even see a need to use conditioner but maybe once a week. I have the thickest oiliest hair imaginable, and this stuff works it is a bit runny at first that is why all you need to do is cup your hand a pour about a teaspoon and a half.  It lathers really thick and gets your hair clean the first time. I do have longer hair though, so if your hair is above your shoulders you may want to use less. I did have to wait ten days for it to arrive though. other than that this product is way more effective than anything I have gotten at the salon or mass merchandiser. Another great point is it is ALL-NATURAL! Nothing harsh is included in this shampoo or any other aubrey organics.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it does a great job on my fine but fluffy mane.  I really like the texture of the lather when things get to going.</li>
