<li> So brown it might as well be black.</li>
<li> The polish pulls away from edge of nails, scratches, and gets a dull finish after a few days.</li>
<li> HAVE LASTED AT LEAST 5 DAYS ON MY NAILS</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have job that is tough on hands</li>

    <li> Okay, but not great.  Didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected it to.  The color was solid after three coats.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that you could find a less expensive one that lasts longer at the drug store (wet and wild, for instance - i had worn it the week previously with no chips....)</li>
    <li> Keeps your polish on . Fast drying</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY, I WAS HOPPING THAT IT WOULD  HAVE LASTED AT LEAST 5 DAYS ON MY NAILS BUT IT DID NOT</li>
    <li> great quality, but hard on your nails</li>
    <li> I was very excited to see this product and ordered two colors. This polish went on nicely and was quick to dry. Most of my nails did not chip for at least five days, but I did notice that the polish chipped quicker on my dominant hand after four days.

This product was much gentler on my nails that Shellac and did last longer than regular polish.</li>
    <li> I am very happy so far with vinylux. Color seems to last. This shade chipped sooner than the  other colors i bought.Shellach gel polish ruined my nails.</li>
    <li> Great dark color. Has hues of browns and reds. This product is a great product so far. NO CHIPPING!!&lt;br /&gt;Dries super fast!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! The color is exactly as advertised and the polish is a great product! I love it</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! I highly recommend it to you!  The price was right too! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great color!! Really worth it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited, but then became quickly disappointed when my nail tips started to chip. It&#x27;s supposed to last a week. I would have taken 3 days!</li>
    <li> Best nail polish ever!It really does look professional and really lasts.....I highly recommend it and would give it ten stars.....</li>
    <li> This polish has lasted an entire week, simply by applying the top coat every 2-3 days.  I&#x27;ll buy more of this product in the future!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Color is beautiful</li>
    <li> I love this brand, I recommend buying the top coat.  it last so much longer than the salon.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite long lasting polish.  I do my own home manicure and wanted a long lasting polish system.  Vinylux does not disappoint.  At my nail salon they charge an extra $5 to have this polish applied.  I bring my own polish when I have a manicure.  Who needs to pay $5 -  I have several of these colors and this one is a favorite color.  Chocolate look.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color - perfect for all year round use; dries quickly and looks great. Shipping was fast !!</li>
    <li> Love it - I am wearing it right now! Such a dark great retro looking color without being purple or black. Reddish brown.</li>
    <li> Long lasting manicure, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this polish.  It is an expensive polish, but well worth it.  I can polish my nails at home, they dry in 8 MINUTES!!  And they last for about a week.</li>
    <li> Its is like eggplant with a red tint. very dark but not black. i use three coats and it seems to extend the life beyond 7 days. alos wearing nails short helps.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife. Great colour</li>
    <li> So brown it might as well be black. I didn&#x27;t like the color - but can&#x27;t return it.  You should know that you can&#x27;t return these nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Nice deep color.  Perfect for winter.</li>
    <li> I like the color and was enticed by the promise that this was a polish that would last a week.  Well, it didn&#x27;t stay very nice for long (about 4 days). I don&#x27;t have job that is tough on hands, I didn&#x27;t garden or do hand dish-washing. The polish pulls away from edge of nails, scratches, and gets a dull finish after a few days. I have found my OPI or ESSIE nail polishes with their standard top coats last much longer and stay nicer looking. It&#x27;s a great idea that still needs some work.</li>
