<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great on my mixed hair...a must have.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this producy</li>
    <li> This was the first of the Jennifer Aniston products I tried. I thought I was mad hoping her hair products could give me lovely hair like hers. But it works. Even without blow drying I get smooth hair. It&#x27;s incredible. And her shampoo and conditioner are great too.</li>
    <li> Got this as a free sample in a sephora package .  Love it! Love it! It holds your curl all day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what was promised, my hair still needed to be washed everyday.</li>
    <li> I like the way it helps to distribute my PHD 5 in 1, but u don&#x27;t wash my hair any less</li>
    <li> This is no kidding the best hair product I have ever used.  I have fine oily must wash every day hair. Not with the style extender! I can go 2 or sometimes even 3 days between washes.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best hair care product ever invented. It smooths, shines, protects and makes my style last for days even if I curl my hair</li>
    <li> This tube will probably last me years! Leaves my hair super soft, sleek and shiny! Use it every time after I wash my hair!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works. I can actually extend the style longer than I want to and want to wash again. Truly lives up to its claim and I actually reordered. I was skeptical but am very happy!  I will note it thickens your hair texture a bit, which you may or may not like.</li>
    <li> This product has transformed the straightening of my very thick curly hair. With the addition of this primer -- the first product I put on my towel dried hair pre-drying-- I can wear my hair straight a full seven days before needing to wash it again. The primer manages to keep my hair fresh and soft and blocks the build-up of oil so I can just wake up and re-blow out my hair after my morning shower without the need for dry shampoo or the addition of other products. I just use a heat protecting spray in the morning prior to blowdrying my hair for a minute or two and it&#x27;s as if I had just blown it out from wet that morning for a full week. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product, and also the hair spray. Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the only thing going for this product is that is smells nice. Other than that it is definitely not worth the money. I ordered it directly from the website because they gave me free shipping but it still wasn&#x27;t worth it. I makes my hair feel greasy and weighed down so much that it took me almost 3 washes to get it out of my hair. I really wanted to like this product but was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does an amazing job of keeping my hair from getting greasy looking when I don&#x27;t wash it every day.</li>
    <li> I actually first got this product as a sample from Sephora, and LOVED it. Knew I needed to buy more. My thick,curly hair feels silky smooth whether styled straight or left curly. The product was also shipped quickly! Highly recommend - this hair serum will truly streamline your routine!</li>
    <li> This product has made a difference in my at home blow out routine! It really does help extend your blowout for at least 3 days! Great price and delivery time as well. Will be ordering again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, frizzy hair and live in DA SOUTH with all the humidity. This keeps my hair smooth for the majority of the day and a little goes a long way. Top with a hair oil and have glorious non-fuzzy head for the day.</li>
    <li> I have very oily, fine hair that takes FOREVER to dry that has to be washed every day.  I got this hoping I could go at least two days without having to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does decrease the time it takes to dry my hair, but I still have to wash my hair every day.  It says it&#x27;s also supposed to help hold the style in your hair, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. I got a sample at a beauty store before ordering the full size. Amazing product, price, and shipping! I got it 2 days after ordering it. Thank you so much, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Ok, I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I had to share...I got a sample of this product at a store and was doubtful since there are so many high-end haircare products and none of them every really stands out above the rest in my opinion. I tend to stick with mostly Aveda products but am always looking for the next best product to add to my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is AWESOME!!! You really don&#x27;t need very much of it and you can use it as a pre-styler or between washes and your hair will look shinier &amp; smoother! The price point is about right since it&#x27;s close to what you would pay for an Aveda style serum. I haven&#x27;t bought the full size bottle so I can&#x27;t tell you if it would last as long as Aveda but I would imagine so. Definitely a must have!!</li>
    <li> Helps to tame the frizz</li>
    <li> Weightless, smells wonderful, and keeps hair looking great between washes. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I use the Living Proof Perfect Hair Day shampoo and conditioner and then when my hair is towel dried, I use the Prime Style Extender.  I spread it generously from roots to ends.  It is a creamy formula and it spreads easily throughout my hair.  It didn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily at all.  I then used the LP No Frizz styling spray all over.  I let my hair air dry overnight and then in the morning, use a curling iron to create loose waves.  The styling spray does an excellent job of defining my curls and gives them plenty of hold.  In fact,  today was quite humid and I had absolutely no frizz whatsoever.  I did use the LP Restore heat protection spray because the primer and styling spray do not have thermal protectants (disappointing). This is the first time I used all five Living Proof products together and I have to say that I got better results than with my previous regimen.  One of the claims of the Style Extender is that it increases the effectiveness of styling products.  This was definitely what happened for me.  My curls lasted the entire day and still looked good the next morning, which is unheard of for me.  And my hair definitely stayed clean longer.  I usually wash my hair every two days but the shampoo and conditioner, coupled with the primer, gave me two more days in between shampoos.  This means that my precious hair color will stay fresh and bright and also means less wear and tear on my tresses.  I really am impressed with LP products but unfortunately, they are extremely expensive to use.  However, I can say that I only used a dollop of shampoo/conditioner the size of a quarter and my hair is below shoulder length, and I used a dab the size of a quarter of the primer as well.  Maybe they will last a while.  It is almost freaky that I had absolutely no frizz even on a day with 90% humidity (I live in Florida where the humidity is off the rails, lol!).  My 2nd day hair still looked great so no additional styling was necessary.  All in all, I highly recommend these products.  There is a significant investment here but if I have a great hair day every day, it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  I have a hall closet full of hair products that failed to live up to their claims.  Now I&#x27;ve found a line that delivers on its promises so maybe it&#x27;s time to purge the closet.  It would be nice to have the space for linens again, lol!these products.

    <li> Love this product! Put a dab on damp hair and it looks like a professional blow out when you&#x27;re done drying it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and will be using from here on in and have told my friends and family about it</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It takes very little.  Gives real shine and control.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see enough WOW to ever spend $20 on this product again. It really was not worth it. To me product is important to the finished style and this didn&#x27;t cut it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is so fantastic! I wash, condition, leave in condition, and then add this primer through my hair roots to ends. Then I spritz with a light oil and blow dry. The combination leaves my naturally wavy, frizzy hair nice and smooth and easy to style. If I miss it, it shows! It helps hold my curls after styling for DAYS! I work a little bit through dry hair in  between washes to help keep frizz down. I love this stuff. I recommend it to all my peeps.</li>
    <li> helps my style last longer I am a big fan !</li>
    <li> Prime keeps my oily hair clean and styled for at least one extra day-sometimes even two days. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy longish brown hair that gets frizzy really easily. This product is life changing for me. Makes my hair smooth, reduces frizz and makes it easier to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many anti frizz serums in the past but they all are silicone based (even Moroccan oil) and dry my hair out after using them for a while or add so much weight. This one is really weightless. I&#x27;ve been using this a few months now so know it&#x27;s not a fluke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained that it flattens their already thin or straight hair. I can see that and if you have thin, straight hair this may not be for you because one of the reasons I like this so much is that it gets rid of the \\&quot;poof\\&quot; factor of my hair. If you&#x27;re going for volume this might not help.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I live in a humid climate and have wavy frizzy hair, this really helps me control my hair. I&#x27;ll defiantly buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair, and live in a very humid climate, so for me, this product is amazing. I will never be without it again.</li>
    <li> It flattened my hair.  I thought it might work better for someone with thicker, frizzier hair so I gave it to my friends at work to try and she said it did nothing for her hair.  She and I both agree that it feels heavy on the hair and that it looks dirtier.  I tried it for an entire week.  Whether I blow dried my hair or curled my hair, this stuff weighed my hair down and made it look messy and dirty.  I&#x27;m back to Got2be Fatastic mousse.</li>
    <li> This review is from Brad&#x27;s wife :) My hair is naturally curly (tight waves - not spirals) and I usually wear it straight. I shower at night, rough dry my hair partially and go to bed, and in the morning flat iron it. I bought this to see how it would affect my styling and I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference. The texture of the product is also odd - it feels like a primer, so it&#x27;s not soft or creamy when you put it on. It&#x27;s more like glue... but my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten crunchy. I&#x27;m just not convinced it either smooths my hair or extends the life of the straightening.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long hair and I flat iron it after every washing. Using this product has lengthened the time in between washes for me. This is AMAZING because it&#x27;s such a hassle to manage this mane!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased Living Proof style extender, I can say from my experience I really love this product!</li>
    <li> But I do plan on purchasing it this weekend (My review is based on a sample size; enough for at least a full week worth of use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample I received indicated that this would help prolong your hair style while repelling dirt/oil.  I was primarily hoping this would help benefit my bangs and prevent them from looking greasy/oily/piecy the next day (darned oil slick forehead...) but it really does nothing in that regard -- I think it helps a little for keeping my bangs in check mid-afternoon; but hard to tell if that&#x27;s just wishful thinking.  Additionally, I don&#x27;t feel as if it does anything for prolonging your hairstyle; if anything, I found it a little more difficult to style my hair.  Curls don&#x27;t seem to take hold or want to set when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for why I plan on purchasing this product...  It makes my hair feel Ah-Mazing!  Super soft and silky; the kind of feeling you get when your hair has been freshly cut.  I also really enjoy the scent; can&#x27;t really put my finger on what it smells like but I think it smells very nice and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of scented products to begin with.  This is great for a blow out or any other sleek hairstyle; it also seems to keep my baby hairs/fly aways at bay (not entirely, but noticeably more so than when I&#x27;m without product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically; don&#x27;t buy it if you expect it to do what it claims or if you&#x27;re hoping to eek in a second no-wash day.  It&#x27;s a nice product but not exactly as advertised.  If you have a Sephora nearby, you can probably get a free sample to try out before committing to a full purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Don&#x27;t know how or why it works, but it does.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair and does not make hair feel heavy or greasy. Look foward to trying other products from Living Proof!</li>
    <li> I live in a very humid area and I have semi curly hair that I straighten daily and only wash it twice a week. This works fine but I feel like my hair gets greasy much quicker when I use this.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t that good a product, I saw no difference.  I know Jennifer Aniston is an owner but my hair doesn&#x27;t look like hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Nice product, delivered as promised. Seller recommended !!!</li>
    <li> This is my Favorite from Living Proof i have already ordered several of these 5 oz Style Extenders and i like when a product works as they claim it to.This really holds your style throughout the day and into the next morning ,i wash my hair every day but i noticed when i wake up if i just run the Brush through it the style falls back in place,With this product you can use as much as you want and your hair wont look flat and oily ,after i put this on i use other styling products over this but if you want this can be used alone.This product is one worth trying.I dont think you will be disappointed.update july 23,2017 im still using this faithfully I know some reviewers said they recieved a fake one. I purchased mine from Specialized Beauty Store here in Amazon and it is without a doubt the real deal (Authentic).I recently bought a tube at ulta for 30 dollars and compared the two and they were the same.This still keeps my hair looking great through the entire day just a quick brush and my style falls back into place.I would definitely know the difference had I recieved a fake .The real product does not disappoint!</li>
    <li> When you use this product in wet hair make sure you work it in your whole head. It hold your style for a week , if you can stand not washing it. I can&#x27;t live with out this I&#x27;m so happy I found living proof!</li>
    <li> I use this on my pixie cut.  I have thick hair.  I like the texture of the product and a little does go a long way.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day but I do get it wet everyday so I apply a very small amount each time.  I can only go about 3 days with this product and then I have to wash my hair because it becomes too weighed down and a little greasy.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a great texture, I use when I air dry my long waves.</li>
    <li> Really does extend your curls. Best styling cream I have found after trying many different brands. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  Prime Style Extender does everything that it says.  It extends my hairstyle keeping my hair fresh and clean, and always looking like it was just styled.  I can&#x27;t wait to try all of the other Living Proof products!</li>
    <li> I think of this product similar to the primer I put on my face before applying make-up - it&#x27;s primer for my hair. I put it on after the shower and then style my hair. The curls stay longer and my hair smells great too for days afterward.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t  know what this is supposed to do, but I could see no benefit at all.  It does not do much of anything and I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this with a Sephora order so decided to get a full size bottle once I&#x27;d used that up.  I purchased it through Amazon because I could get it shipped faster and for free with my Prime membership.  I use it alone on my freshly washed, damp hair, working the product in from root to tip.  It not only smells delicious (my hubby loves it!) but it truly does help your style stay longer.  (It should be noted that I am blessed with hair that isn&#x27;t greasy so I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day, so this product really works for me because my style lasts the two or three days between washings.)  I am pleased with this product and will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> I have past my shoulder, thick, fine, wavy, frizzy hair that has a lot of blonde highlights. This stuff is magic. I used it in humid Cancun, and my hair actually stayed curled!  Not for 2 days, but still for a long evening for sure. I love this product, not only does my hair stay curled, but it&#x27;s soft and bouncy too, in Cancun humidity! I also used Living Proof no frizz shampoo and conditioner while I was there. I definitely will buy more.</li>
    <li> I have VERY fine hair, and it&#x27;s naturally curly, and I blow it dry straight. With my hair, I usually can&#x27;t go multiple days without washing it. I WISH I could say my hair looked better the more &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; it gets.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but I can say that I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I shampoo/condition hair&amp; apply this while hair is damp, and then blow dry it, and it&#x27;s been 24hrs+, and my hair still feels great, my hair isn&#x27;t oily at all yet, and I think I&#x27;ll be able to go at least another 24hrs before I even start thinking it needs to be washed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched my shampoo/conditioner up too, so I can&#x27;t 100% say it&#x27;s this product that&#x27;s doing the trick, but I think it&#x27;s helping! It doesn&#x27;t control the &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; as much as I&#x27;d like it to, but overall it&#x27;s doing a good job. Has a nice light scent too. Not heavy.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product is legit.  My frizzy, thick hair is under control and shiny.  I look more put together when I use this stuff. Priced incredibly reasonable for everything this serum does, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many products.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My hair is shinier&lt;br /&gt;And it holds it&#x27;s style just like it says.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> really helps keep the style, good fragrance, but it leaves a film that makes the hair feel sticky</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to getting this product. I followed the instructions to the letter. I really did not see any visible results. So, I tried three more times  and followed the instructions as stated on the product package. This product is certainly a let down. I was hoping for better results then what I got using living proof. It&#x27;s not worth the money. The hope was less hair washing and less styling and that never happened. I still had to wash and style my hair daily.  I am a 49 year old female with long hair. My advise SAVE YOUR MONEY. [[ASIN:B008U5RUW8 Living Proof Prime Style Extender(tm) 5 oz]]</li>
    <li> First;I&#x27;m a product junkie!  I have &amp;/or have owned almost every line produced in my search for 1. Volume &amp; 2. Style hold!!  I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times, &amp; it&#x27;s so unlike other products it&#x27;s hard to adjust but, my fine, thin hair holds it&#x27;s style but remains soft &amp; the same time????  Also, helps to add some volume.  I plan to use another living proof product I&#x27;ve been using for years-though I can&#x27;t recall the name @ this time.  This line has proven a must in my daily grooming as my hair is flat to my head &amp; straight as a board w/out it!</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of Living Proof items.  I was jazzed to try this, too, from the description I thought it would be great for my longish hair that requires a ton of straightening and lots of product (especially Living Proof product).  But I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference when using this product, sadly.  It does smelly really nice, though.  It was packaged well &amp; arrived on time, so that aspect was quite good.</li>
    <li> This is good, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost. I put it on towel-dried hair and comb through before blow-drying. The smell is OK--nothing wonderful, but not bad. I like the product, but it&#x27;s pricey enough that I probably won&#x27;t buy it again since I&#x27;m not noticing a big difference.</li>
    <li> I thought this was great the first time I used it, and the smell was wonderful, but I don&#x27;t really notice any great change now, if it was cheaper I would continue to but, but was a little disappointed..</li>
    <li> Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  Actually does hold style till next morning.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is a good product and it was a good price without shipping costs.</li>
    <li> The product helps keep the frizzies tamed.  The smell is a bit like grapefruit...really nice.  The flat ironing is easier now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old female with very fine blonde hair. I wanted something that would keep my hair from looking greasy. I have 8 am classes and had to shower before going to class every morning or my hair looked just nasty by the end of the day. I tried this product by putting it in my hair the night before and WOW! My hair did not get greasy all the next day. And I did a lot of running around. I&#x27;m hooked! I don&#x27;t believe this product is meant to hold style, but it definitely did it&#x27;s job of keeping my hair looking fresh. I definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on hair. It&#x27;s light, makes my hair practically bouncy!! I wear it alone without anything else after and it really helps my style last.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST. PRODUCT. EVER.  I use it with Wen and my hair has never looked better.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be an authentic product OR it is possibly old and different than what is being sold currently in stores.  The packaging is different than my other tube (purchased at Sephora recently), the labeling is different on the package, and the scent and feel of the product is TOTALLY different.  I am NOT PLEASED and can&#x27;t use this since I don&#x27;t know what it may do to my hair.</li>
    <li> I hate saying this..but i&#x27;m extremely disappointed with Living Proof anti frizz products!!!  They don&#x27;t last until the next day at all!!! I have also bought a fortune from Ulta who I know will let me return them...A lot of hype..for nothing...I&#x27;m going back to Redken and Paul Mitchell products.I&#x27;m sticking with Ulta&#x27;s suggestions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m astounded at the difference this makes in how my hair feels and how long it goes between washes. It not only extended the time between washes, but enhanced the appearance of my hair each day.</li>
    <li> it just does not works for me:(</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday product! It is extremely light, but help keeps my hair looking nice for days! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product. It is light weight and works well with other products. It helps to keep your hair from getting greasy throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Just ok. It did keep the style a little better, but I felt like my hair wasn&#x27;t as silky as usual.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair is fine and this holds the style longer and my hair feels awesome highly recommended</li>
    <li> I love love this stuff. My hair has volume that stays even until the next morning.</li>
    <li> i was very skeptical when i received my sample in the mail from the facebook challenge. It is a good size sample they sent me as well. it smells floral and is light weight. but i followed the directions, made sure it was in my hair root to tip,  and let me just say, WOW! this is my new best friend. i consider myself a product junkie. I love make up, cleansers, tools, colors, all of it. this product is a definite staple in my day to day regimond. after applying the product on damp hair, i finished my make up and styled my hair. it kept that style in for 3 days. curl, smoothness, no frizz, it was awesome. i have very thin hair that gets greasy after just one day. it repels dirt from your hair. it is amazing. i am a believer in the brand now and have since ordered a full size of the prime style extender, which comes with a sample of the full shampoo and conditioner. I am a former Aveda junkie and I do still love my Aveda, it will take a lot to get me to switch my shampoo and conditioner over, but if their shampoos and conditioners are as good as the prime style extender, i may have to do a full switch. my hair feels good, it stays clean, it smells great, and it actually holds in the style. i would recommend this to everyone! it&#x27;s a great investment.</li>
    <li> I have given this a try and I must say this is a fabulous product!  It&#x27;s weightless, has a nice floral scent, greaseless and very, very light.  I have very fine short hair and this product does not weight it down or make it look greasy.  It kept my style for 4 days and all the while leaving your hair soft and silky.  A LITTLE OF THIS PRODUCT GOES A LONG WAY. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this!  This product really works and extends my hair style, which is not easy since when I wake up, I typically have really bad bed hair.  Highly recommend this hair product!</li>
    <li> This is one of the only hair products I have to have. It really does extend the time I have before my hair starts acting up. This keeps my hair good to go for around 48 hours. Since using this product along with the Living Proof weightless spray I&#x27;ve noticed that I hardly ever stress about my hair anymore. I put these two products on before blow drying and I am done. It really has made my life a lot easier because I hate spending time on my hair. I only started using these products last year after a summer of horrible hair almost made me insane. The split ends had exploded like an invading army all over my head and I had no idea what to do. The Living Proof products are totally worth the price. One tube of this actually lasts me for close to three months and I have long hair. You do not need a lot of this per use. My hair is pretty wavy and prone to frizz but these products really kept the frizz under control. I also like the way it smells, which is very faint.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for something like this for a long time.  Will buy again. Would like to try their other products.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to the line of products to control frizz and straighten hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many products with no success.this works!!</li>
    <li> Light hair product with a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I saw an ad for this when I was at the hairdresser and decided to splurge.  It really does allow you to skip a day of washing, drying and styling.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but it really works for me! I can go three days without doing much to my hair. I&#x27;ve always had bed head the next day and my hair stays put! Will continue to buy this - works great when you&#x27;re traveling! I also bought the shampoo, conditioner and hair thickening serum. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Use it ever time a dry my hair...holds the style for days....best cream I have discovered. No greasy at all</li>
    <li> This really does extend your style.  However, I found that after about a month of regular use my hair became extremely dry and frazzled.  Had to switch back to Aveda.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. You can&#x27;t even feel it in your hair but my style lasts all day! The smell is awesome! Recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I notice my hair has a different texture when I use this and it stays straight longer.</li>
    <li> Its a nice product, but it does not do what Jennifer Anniston says it does. I still have to fix my hair just as much on the second day.  Probably wont order again</li>
    <li> What a great product - smells great (as does the rest of the line) and helps extend my style for at least one more day. I travel for business, so I&#x27;m always looking for a good product that helps simplify things for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, absolutely love how my hair feels and smells after use!</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff!!! This stuff really helps me before work when I have having those lazy days and just want to not put much effort into doing my hair. I picked this up when I continued my search, looking for a light gel to keep my flyaways down and to keep my bangs going to the side (to help force them to go side swept). This gel is peeeeerrrfect! The only way I think this can disappoint is if you are looking for crunchy kind of gel and a crazy maximum hold. This gel I would say is more for keeping looser hair styles in place and smaller hairs at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;+Very VERY light gel&lt;br /&gt;+Does not harden, keeps hair touchably soft&lt;br /&gt;+No weird residue even if you overapply&lt;br /&gt;+Does not make your hair/feel greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously no cons at all. This is my HG hair product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to extend my style for a day or so.  I also tried it on my daughters.  My 10 yr old has medium bodied hair and while it didn&#x27;t weigh her hair down - I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in keeping it looking nice.  My 8 yr old and I both have fine hair which can look stringy pretty quickly and gets really flat overnight after sleeping.  If anything, the product made our hair feel greasy and weighed down.  Didn&#x27;t particularly care for the fragrance either - it&#x27;s not horrible, just a bit like a mens body wash.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  I suppose it may work for thick &amp; coarse hair, but didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> This primer is perfect for a night out on the town or helping your hairstyle last all day! It&#x27;s not thick or sticky. It holds your hair in place without giving it that crunchy hard feel.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B008U5RUW8 Living Proof Prime Style Extender(tm) 5 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about keeping the style longer than a day for me since I am a crazy sleeper.  However, it definitely gives me HUGE volume, fullness and keeps the style through out the day (even through very windy and rainy day).  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and have gotten compliments that it looks like I have lots of hair all of a sudden (normally my hair are on a thin side).  It also keeps it from getting oily by the end of the day.  My routine is:  Living Proof Shampoo/Conditioner, Prime Extender all over hair and Living Proof Thick Cream on the roots -- works wonders!  Def my HG products.</li>
    <li> Best stylist stuff ever!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a California girl who moved to the Midwest Very different climate then in used to Living proof products are the only thing that work on my hair since moving here This extender smells great and works awesome .Alittle goes a long way ,</li>
    <li> got a sample from Sephora and love the smell and how it makes my hair feel, now ready to try it for a full go</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I found this product. I have naturally curly hair, but it is fine. Using only a small amount of Living Proof on wet hair before&lt;br /&gt;blowing it dry, gives it amazing volume. Never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair care products i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> favorite hair product!</li>
    <li> Received a sample of this with another Living Proof Purchase and was sold.  It was delivered via USPS and got frozen in our mailbox.  It didn&#x27;t seem to affect the product at all.  Just let it thaw at room temperature and have been using with success ever since. I have a short bob hairstyle and fine hair texture. This product keeps my style looking good for three days which is great.  In addition to the Style Extender I use a very tiny amount of No Frizz to keep it sleek.  Very happy with my purchase and how it performs.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it really works on my hair, I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it. Cheaper on Amazon than at Sephora.</li>
</ol>
