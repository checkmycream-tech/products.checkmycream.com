      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>More like a lotion than a foundation.</li>

      <li>Be sure to moisturize before using it otherwise it&#x27;ll get stuck in your pores.</li>

    <li> I was thinking this was going to be a light coverage but it is more like a moisturizer that is tinted but the tint does not do anything. I do love the way it feels on. I bought for a sheer coverage but I love it as a base coverage for moisturizer  light pre-foundation.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about Eminence.  It does work well but you have to be careful how you put it on your skin and the color is light at first but the longer it is on me it gets darker.  Bottle should last a long time.  My age is over 50.  I would tell friends about Eminence.</li>

    <li> I bought this as i use Eminence. I don&#x27;t like to wear foundation, but unfortuantely the moisterizer i have don&#x27;t have SPF in it. This one does the trick. More like a lotion than a foundation. Love it.</li>

    <li> This is a wonderful, tinted moisturizer with SPF.  Love the texture of the lotion and the slight hint of color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so sheer you don&#x27;t even see it on your skin. It smells good but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s good sunscreen.</li>
    <li> My face had begun to have an allergic reaction,, so I&#x27;ve discontinued use.</li>
    <li> The item was not even in close proximaty to the original color. The formula was evidently not the same. I&#x27;m wondering what was even in it.</li>
