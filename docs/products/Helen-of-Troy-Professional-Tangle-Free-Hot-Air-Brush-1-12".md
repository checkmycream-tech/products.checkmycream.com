### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m a stylist and this works perfect for smoothing hair.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re ever in Europe Braun makes the rotating type perfectly my friend has one there</li>
      <li>I find this to be a great styling tool.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is a great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and good for travel I guess, but when it breaks I&#x27;ll be buying the Conair version again.</li>
      <li>This is a great tool and I love using it.  </li>
      <li>In fact I love it!  </li>
      <li>This Hot Air Brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>it works even better than the curling brush!  </li>
      <li>I was happy to get another one for free.</li>
      <li>I own this curling iron</li>
      <li>I never thought when I came home that I would not be able to find an equally good product.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
      <li>the hot air brush does work it makes my hair look great.</li>
      <li>However, one never lasts more than 6 months to a year.</li>
      <li>I have lost count of how many I have owned.</li>
      <li>I have lost count how many I have owned.</li>
      <li>However, I have not been able to find another brand to replace it with.    </li>
      <li>Inside the openings many dust balls had formed and collected.</li>
      <li>Great fast service.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find this anywhere in my town.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely the best hot air brush curler.  </li>
      <li>Good quality and reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Curls my hair quickly &amp; easily.</li>
      <li>It easy to use, and curls well -</li>
      <li>I do wish the company would make a stronger motor with more power, but it&#x27;s still great for finishing up styling my hair after a blow dryer has gotten my hair all or mostly dry.</li>
      <li>This item was fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Like many others, I&#x27;ve loved this product when it&#x27;s working properly and not shutting off.</li>
      <li>Should partially dry longer hair first for best experience.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair smooth, bouncy and full of body.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several of them, It always work great at first</li>
      <li>If you turn this brush off in order to comb or brush your hair out, it will not turn on again until you let it cool.</li>
      <li>You have to wait for it to cool off.  </li>
      <li>Thrilled to find on-line and bought extras to keep in suitcase for frequent travel--relatively compact and lightweight.</li>
      <li>Fast &amp; easy way to style.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this a 3 star because although it mostly does the job, it needs more power - 250W is not really enough, and they need to fix the overheating problem to really make it a quality product.</li>
      <li>It is working great and makes my extremely curly hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly the type product I was looking for.</li>
      <li>You may be able to twist it to snap off or you may need to insert something to snap it off, but it will snap back on.</li>
      <li>(The description on the VS model does not list the wattage and I was hoping it would be higher than 250W)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like it!  </li>
      <li>Curls are smoothe, and hair is not damaged like some bristle brush hot air curlers can do.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you use a regular hair dryer and then go over with this!</li>
      <li>This is a great product, but it does not last long.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a Hot Air Brush for long time and finally decided to purchase this one because it had pretty good reviews.  </li>
      <li>This hot air brush lifts, dries and really does not tangle your hair while styling.</li>
      <li>4.now it quickly over heats and completely shuts off.</li>
      <li>I really like this particular Hot Air Brush.  </li>
      <li>I really wish they would fix these two problems.  </li>
      <li>Many local retail stores do not carry this product and I like the 1 1/2 inch barrell for soft straight curles.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It is light and easy to hold and way easier than messing around with the blow dryer and round brush at the same time.  </li>
      <li>You must make sure to dry your hair first with a hairdryer until the hair is about 80% dry.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have had with it is that it tends to overheat easily and stops working even after a short use.</li>
      <li>on(it doesn&#x27;t turn back on right away),</li>
      <li>Seems that when you use it and then shut it off you cannot turn it back on right away.  </li>
      <li>These problems require too much effort and make the entire process very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The snap case near the cord at the end of the brush needs to be cleaned!</li>
      <li>I took out the extra year warranty on the last one I bought and sure enough just after a year it died.</li>
      <li>It is a clever way to softly curl or smooth and dry hair using only one hand.  </li>
      <li>The dryer does not get hot enough it is the same as a very low&lt;br /&gt;warm</li>
      <li>Love this item, I am not coordinated enough to blow dry my hair and use a curling brush at the same time.  </li>
      <li>The only negatives - if you keep it on too long, it will shut off, and if you&#x27;ve had it on awhile, and shut it off, it has to cool down some before you are able to turn it back on.  </li>
      <li>no other Co. makes one w/a bigger barrel that blows hot air.</li>
      <li>There is a rounded case near the cord that can be snapped off.</li>
      <li>I keep looking for a replacement brand, but so far can&#x27;t find one.</li>
      <li>I blow dry my hair first &amp; then use this to curl &amp; flip my hair.</li>
      <li>the exact same product and the VS styler actually has \\&quot;Helen of Troy\\&quot; printed on the clear plastic sticker.  </li>
      <li>I agree with Spencer&#x27;s review; 1.the hot air brush barrel became loose and would spin around,2.the handle</li>
      <li>After cleaning out the dust balls and snapping the case back on, it works like new again!</li>
      <li>Other than the color, they are EXACTLY</li>
      <li>I also wish the manufacturer would improve the wattage and other components used in the hot air brush, until then I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
      <li>and it did not dry or help give my hair a bit of curl under or to flip it out.</li>
      <li>With this product all you do is blow dry your hair with a regular blow dryer not quite dry and then use the hot hair brush.</li>
      <li>Works great for big soft curls, too bad they only last 1 year as I&#x27;m on my 3rd one but</li>
      <li>far as performance, I&#x27;ve had a H of T 1\\&quot; for a little over a year that mostly did the job, but it started overheating as is common.  </li>
      <li>However, it does not last very long (about a year) and you have to buy a new one.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this item, I am not coordinated enough to blow dry my hair and use a curling brush at the same time.  With this product all you do is blow dry your hair with a regular blow dryer not quite dry and then use the hot hair brush.</li>
    <li> I own this curling iron and I really like it.  In fact I love it!  It is working great and makes my extremely curly hair soft and manageable.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I agree with Spencer&#x27;s review; 1.the hot air brush barrel became loose and would spin around,2.the handle came loose so I had to use a pony tail holder to keep it together, 3.when I turn it off I have to wait several minutes before it will come back on(it doesn&#x27;t turn back on right away), 4.now it quickly over heats and completely shuts off. These problems require too much effort and make the entire process very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the hot air brush does work it makes my hair look great. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair probably because of the material used on the barrel.  I like the material used on the barrel. I also wish the manufacturer would improve the wattage and other components used in the hot air brush, until then I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the type product I was looking for. The only problem I have had with it is that it tends to overheat easily and stops working even after a short use. Otherwise, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> This arrived broken the barrel never rotated. I used it a few times just as a dryer to curl my hair while it was just barely damp and it did not dry or help give my hair a bit of curl under or to flip it out. I have a short Boband my hair is thin so it was not a tall order. The dryer does not get hot enough it is the same as a very low&lt;br /&gt;warm setting on your hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will look for a metal type barrel and just forget about the rotating part since it seems no Company in the U.S has any that do the job well. If you&#x27;re ever in Europe Braun makes the rotating type perfectly my friend has one there and I was addicted to using hers there it may be dual voltage. I never thought when I came home that I would not be able to find an equally good product.</li>
    <li> I really like this particular Hot Air Brush.  It easy to use, and curls well - and I like the handle.  The only negatives - if you keep it on too long, it will shut off, and if you&#x27;ve had it on awhile, and shut it off, it has to cool down some before you are able to turn it back on.  Those things can be annoying, but you just have to work around it.</li>
    <li> This Hot Air Brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is a clever way to softly curl or smooth and dry hair using only one hand.  Good quality and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I concur with other reviewers, this product styles my hair well, produces a smoothe, bouncy curl. Hair never tangles in the plastic bristles, and it doesn&#x27;t overheat my hair. However, one never lasts more than 6 months to a year. The teeth of the plastic brush wear out against the metal barrel, and it spins around. Some have overheated. Nonetheless, I am ordering my 8th or 10th, because it styles my hair so well.</li>
    <li> Great fast service.  Item was exacatly what I was looking for. Many local retail stores do not carry this product and I like the 1 1/2 inch barrell for soft straight curles.</li>
    <li> Mine died after only 2 months, and I only use it once/week.  So 8 styling jobs and it was dead, dead, dead.  Is it me??</li>
    <li> This item was fantastic.  I used it maybe twice a week.  But it only lasted around 4 months, and will not turn on now.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool and I love using it.  However, it does not last very long (about a year) and you have to buy a new one.  The barrel with the brushes starts spinning around.  It is not suppose to do that.  Also, I have had some problems with over heating.  Seems that when you use it and then shut it off you cannot turn it back on right away.  You have to wait for it to cool off.  I really wish they would fix these two problems.  I like the tool otherwise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a Hot Air Brush for long time and finally decided to purchase this one because it had pretty good reviews.  I really like it!  It is light and easy to hold and way easier than messing around with the blow dryer and round brush at the same time.  The bristles do not tangle in my hair and the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle either.  I use a volume spray when my hair is slightly wet and then a comb through hairspray while I style - it works even better than the curling brush!  I have long hair and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a great styling tool. It leaves my hair smooth, bouncy and full of body. You must make sure to dry your hair first with a hairdryer until the hair is about 80% dry. Then finish up with the air brush.    The con of this air brush is the lack of quality. I have lost count of how many I have owned. They tend to last just a little longer than the one year warranty period. However, I have not been able to find another brand to replace it with.    If you turn this brush off in order to comb or brush your hair out, it will not turn on again until you let it cool. This can get annoying.</li>
    <li> This product is THE ANSWER for me. I have very fine hair. This hot air brush lifts, dries and really does not tangle your hair while styling.</li>
    <li> The snap case near the cord at the end of the brush needs to be cleaned! Like many others, I&#x27;ve loved this product when it&#x27;s working properly and not shutting off. I&#x27;ve purchased several of them, It always work great at first but after a couple of months of use it always start working intermittently, needing to \\&quot;rest\\&quot; for a while once it&#x27;s turned off before it can be turned on again. My husband figured out the problem! There is a rounded case near the cord that can be snapped off. Inside the openings many dust balls had formed and collected. After cleaning out the dust balls and snapping the case back on, it works like new again! You may be able to twist it to snap off or you may need to insert something to snap it off, but it will snap back on. I hope this helps others who have have the same problem as seems to be case in other reviews. From now on, I&#x27;ll be cleaning it out every month. I do wish the company would make a stronger motor with more power, but it&#x27;s still great for finishing up styling my hair after a blow dryer has gotten my hair all or mostly dry.</li>
    <li> Works great for big soft curls, too bad they only last 1 year as I&#x27;m on my 3rd one but no other Co. makes one w/a bigger barrel that blows hot air.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something like the Infinitipro by Conair that has a spinning feature and is also a hair dryer. However I wanted something smaller for my short hair (just had it cut). This does not spin like the one from Conair. Not worth the price, and not sure why someone would use this one. I wish Conair made different sizes barrel for that product. I guess I will have to wait. Cannot find anything like the Conair. And cannot leave without it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004INUWX0 Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend the helen of troy. Buy the conair instead. It is a life saver. (and a time saver).</li>
    <li> Just a heads-up that this styler and the Vidal Sassoon model V432 are the exact same product and the VS styler actually has \\&quot;Helen of Troy\\&quot; printed on the clear plastic sticker.  So if you were debating on buying the VS over this one - don&#x27;t -save your money.  Other than the color, they are EXACTLY the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance, I&#x27;ve had a H of T 1\\&quot; for a little over a year that mostly did the job, but it started overheating as is common.  I decided to try a bigger barrel and I bought this one and the VS model thinking I&#x27;d compare the two. (The description on the VS model does not list the wattage and I was hoping it would be higher than 250W)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this a 3 star because although it mostly does the job, it needs more power - 250W is not really enough, and they need to fix the overheating problem to really make it a quality product.</li>
    <li> Just make sure you use a regular hair dryer and then go over with this! Long hair tends to get stuck and could cause an accident</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find this anywhere in my town.  I&#x27;m a stylist and this works perfect for smoothing hair.</li>
    <li> Friend recommended product to me--love it. Curls my hair quickly &amp; easily. I blow dry my hair first &amp; then use this to curl &amp; flip my hair. Fast &amp; easy way to style.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but it does not last long. I have lost count how many I have owned. I keep looking for a replacement brand, but so far can&#x27;t find one. Typically this brush dies during year 2. I took out the extra year warranty on the last one I bought and sure enough just after a year it died. I was happy to get another one for free. It is a shame these are not made to last.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best hot air brush curler.  Hair does not get tangled.  Should partially dry longer hair first for best experience. Curls are smoothe, and hair is not damaged like some bristle brush hot air curlers can do.  I first bought one a year ago and searched dozens of stores later, looking for an extra or two, but unable to find. Thrilled to find on-line and bought extras to keep in suitcase for frequent travel--relatively compact and lightweight. Definitely an item I cannot do without!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a similar version by ConAir- while it does soften and straighten my hair, it takes longer b/c the barrel is plastic and doesn&#x27;t conduct heat as well.  It&#x27;s lightweight and good for travel I guess, but when it breaks I&#x27;ll be buying the Conair version again.</li>
