    <li> The Keri lotion is great. I was unhappy beause the tip of the plunger was broken.</li>
    <li> Great product and so reasonable - better than other much more expensive lotion. Can use on Face !&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know why drugstores are not carrying this item.  Great to get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin. After a month of use with this stuff, my skin is much softer and healthier than it was before.</li>
    <li> Image shows two bottles but you only get one. Be aware before you purchase. Won&#x27;t do this again rip off</li>
    <li> We have used Keri lotion for year it&#x27;s like non other have trouble getting it in our town.</li>
    <li> I use this mainly at nights.  I have no complaints at all.  I have been using for a long time and I am satisfied</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I use. It goes on a bit oily but soaks into your skin and leaves it smooth all day long. There is not one other lotion that compares to this product for daily moisturizing of your skin. I love it and the smell is pleasant without being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I have love Keri lotion since about 1991.  I was in the hospital for surgery , and they gave this to me in sample size.  I have loved and used it ever since.</li>
    <li> I have been using Keri lotions for a long time and the stores no longer carry it.  Thanks for having it available for whenever I need it.</li>
    <li> One of the very best products out there! Certainly works for me. Works well and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but was fooled by the picture of two bottles.  Shame on me for not reading it more closely.  I feel jipped.  I&#x27;ll keep the product, but danged if I&#x27;m ever going to pay $14 for one bottle of Keri lotion again, even if it is 20 ounces.</li>
    <li> Loss touch with Keri for a long time until I saw this on Amazon...love the lotion and the fact its on Subscribe and Save and Prime.  Great for skin.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.  This is another product that the stores in my home area quit carrying for some stupid reason.</li>
    <li> The pump was broken when I received this item.  I love Keri lotion and have had a difficult finding it I was thrilled to find this but was very dissappointed when the pump arrived broken.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Keri lotion. I have extremely dry skin and Keri lotion is the only thing that does the trick. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a rich, creamy lotion to combat dermatitis etc.</li>
    <li> I love Keri lotion!  Did you know that is it the only lotion out there that doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol in it&#x27;s ingredient list?  I use the original version on my sensitive skin and don&#x27;t have any problems.  I buy it here because I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore...</li>
    <li> Works fine on repairing my dry skin, but is a little &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; to the touch.</li>
    <li> the problem with &amp;#34;non-greasy&amp;#34; lotions is that they have a moisturizing effect of very short duration.  This is the first lotion I used, back when I was diagnosed with eczema in the Paleolithic Age.  It&#x27;s still one of the best.</li>
    <li> Used for 50+ years.  Greatest lotion I have ever used.  You will not go wrong using Keri lotion.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a little sensitive skin for chemicals. So I always feel anxious to pick the skin items. But I believed the name of brand at this time and I was right. I don&#x27;t have any trouble and my skin condition seems good.</li>
