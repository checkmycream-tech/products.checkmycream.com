    <li> new experience for me-pleasant</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite soaking powder. I started running a few months back and my hamstrings and legs were aching. All aches and pains were relieved after a good 20 minute soak in Dr. Singhas Mustard Bath. Plus, the smell is out of this world. A little eucalyptus and minty. Soothing. You&#x27;ll sleep well after using this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I love it!  I used to run marathons and nothing could touch the aches I would encounter during my training and after my races like this soak.  I don&#x27;t run anymore due to a severe back injury, but I&#x27;ve used it during my recovery and use it now just to take the edge off of everyday backaches.</li>
    <li> its the greatest  good in a bath for your colds, and also make a paste for cuts and infections i have used this for years great for your go to box!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of body aches and pains, and found this product really helped ease the pains, and loosened the stiffness in my joints too.  I have used a lot of different bath products, but this one is by far the best I have ever used.  I use this in combination with some epsom salts.  Just one small scoop of this is all that is needed, and the smell is very pleasant and relaxing.  I came back to order a 32 oz jar of this.</li>
    <li> After a long week, you need to detox! I love this stuff. I can&#x27;t get enough. You don&#x27;t have to leave home to go to a spa. Highly recommend, will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!! We will be ordering it again!</li>
