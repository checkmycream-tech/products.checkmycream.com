<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After 35 years - - I had to get a new clipper set - - - Works Perfectly</li>
    <li> Superfast Shipping !! The last WAHL Haircut Kit lasted me for more than 5 years and I got no reasons why this wouldn&#x27;t !</li>
    <li> The clipper works fine. I have no complaints. Espacially for 25 dollars it is very worth the money and you get guides and combs included. I would certainly reccomend it to anyone. I&#x27;d imagine there&#x27;s a few other Wahl clipper which are of same quality. For 25 bucks you really cant beat it, I&#x27;ve only used it like twice so far but I&#x27;m sure it will work just as it does now for the next few years at least. It also comes with oil. legit.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect set of clippers for anyone looking to do their own hair maintenance.  It comes with a large selection of trim lengths, custom trim guides, and other accoutrements.  The clippers themselves do the job and are easy to maintain.  Ideal set for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I had bought this at Macys today and was skeptical about opening it after reading the two negative reviews. Don&#x27;t listen to those reviews after opening and reading the instructional manual I realized that I actually did not need to read it. It says that the blades are oiled and positioned from the factory and that it is ready to be used.     It did what i wanted it to do perfectly which is shorten my hair, and about 20 minutes later after using it my hair was perfect to my expectations. I even used the #3 clipper to shorten my caveman beard so that when i trimmed with my Gillette it looked presentable.     I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an efficient set of clippers.</li>
    <li> LA MARCA WAHL ES UNA DE LAS MAS RECONOCIDAS EN EL MUNDO... ESTE PRODUCTO LLEGO EN PERFECTO ESTADO Y EN LA FECHA INDICADA EN LA ORDEN DE COMPRA...LOS RECOMIENDO AMPLIAMENTE Y ESTARE ATENTA PARA FUTURAS COMPRAS...EXCELENTE MAQUINA PARA PELUQUERIA...</li>
    <li> My husband had a kit much like this one; just needed a new one. Works great. He cuts everyone&#x27;s hair in the neighborhood. life time use won&#x27;t happen but it lasts about a year with haircuts every 10-14 days</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve only used Wahl clippers to cut my hair, and I bought this set because of the attractive price and the amount of attachments included. This set comes with the special attachments - the green 1/16&amp;#34; which is shorter than a #1, and the purple 1.5 which is right in between #1 and #2. The clipper itself runs fairly quiet, and only needs a small drop of oil to maintain. From experience these clippers last a long time - the only reason why I had to buy another Wahl setup is because I accidentally dropped my previous 3 year old set. It happened to land at the perfect angle to crack the adjustment handle and outer housing - somewhat of a fluke since I have dropped the clipper before on more than one occasion without damage.</li>
    <li> One of the blades was already broken</li>
    <li> This product has many attachments.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my purposes.  Bought cordless trimmer from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> No complaints other than a little loud.</li>
    <li> Wow, hard to believe this thing was so horrible right out of the box.  I followed directions to oil blades before first use.  Despite that, these clippers pulled my hair after about 5 min of use--and I was going from about a 3/8\\&quot; hair length to 1/4\\&quot;--not a big difference.  The other big negative was that the guard kept falling off.  Simply unacceptable.  On the positive side, the kit comes complete with lots of pieces and a nice case...too bad the product itself is so inferior!  I&#x27;ll be pursuing the 30-day money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. Nice, smooth, cut threw hair like nothing. I&#x27;m a fan of Wahl clippers.</li>
    <li> This is not like the other Wahl products I have had. The gaurds come right off while cutting your hair. CHEAP</li>
    <li> I decided to save money by cutting my sons hair and this worked great. The different heads allowed me to fade it like he went to a barber shop.</li>
    <li> Item was very sharp as described, but I&#x27;m giving it two stars is because the clipper came with nicks and scratches all over it and it is heavy and unbalanced in my opinion. Additionally, the tips of the blades are so sharp and pointed that periodically I got bruises in my scalp.</li>
    <li> My husband and I just barely opened the package about a week ago. As we looked through the various pieces, we noticed the number three guard was gone. The clippers worked great, but the number three guard is the one we always use. We would really like to get that piece, but other than that, 5 stars so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers. I have owned a few other s but these are the best so far. Very powerful and quite. Come with every attachment needed and cuts very smooth.</li>
    <li> I am deployed to Afghanistan and purchased this for my weekly haircuts since I am not on a large base with a barber facility.  These clippers have been doing a good job so far, my only recommendation for improving the clippers themselves is providing a tighter shave without a guard.  As they come from the factory, they leave hair at about 1/16 of an inch which is short but for a Marine in the field 1/32 would be more ideal.&lt;br /&gt;As for the plastic covering sheet, the tie straps on the back are flimsy and after just 8 haircuts they have broken off.  Recommend velcro instead of the tie straps.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product for anyone from beginner to advanced.  Has all the necessary guards to provide a fresh tapered cut without leaving a line...once you learn the technique.</li>
    <li> This Wahl is heavy duty, I use this for cut hair for my 3 dogs, hahaha, I love this wahl, my wife do not now, I used for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I bought this haircut kit, so our family could save money on haircuts.  I cut my two sons&#x27; hair, and it worked great.  They are 14 and 16 years old, and like their hair short.  Then I bravely cut my own hair.  Everything went fine, and it has paid for itself already.  My sons have both asked me to cut their hair again.</li>
    <li> great little machine in my opinion it cuts better than the professional clippers</li>
    <li> Nice set used twice now and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clippers to cut my own hair for a couple of months now and so far they perform very well. They feel heavy like commercial clippers. It comes with many guides though I personally only use two. My only issue is with all the small pieces included there isn&#x27;t much organization. Everything just goes loosely into the case.</li>
    <li> it was what I was looking for thanks</li>
    <li> I am never going to pay for a haircut again. I get tons of use out of the scissors alone, layering my own hair, and the clippers I use to do my boy friend haircuts.</li>
    <li> Works well, saving big $$$ on barbers.  If you&#x27;re going to wear a buzz cut anyway why pay a barber $500 + a year for something you can do yourself in ten minutes a week?</li>

    <li> Works Perfectly. Cuts hair easily and with no snags. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. seven more words were required six seven</li>
    <li> Amazing set. The ear trimmers make cutting my own hair so much easier. It has enough pieces that it takes a while to find the pieces you might want, but not enough to make it a perfect set. Personally, I use only 4 pieces, so the set is probably mooooooooore than adequate for the everyday person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars hands down.&lt;br /&gt;It never clogs, doesn&#x27;t seem to cake or get dull. Had it for over a year so it&#x27;s doing fine. The pieces are fine so I can cut my hair without worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is just what it says. You can always count on Wahl to make a durable product, they&#x27;ve been around far too long not to be worth $30</li>
    <li> Good haircuts and easy to use. I recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> The price of this pays for itself within a few haircuts.  I&#x27;m giving hair cuts to all of my buddies and saving them lots of $$$ by saving them a trip to the barber.</li>
    <li> Excellent haircutter!</li>
    <li> I recently posted a negative review about this product and I was mistaken. I received everything in the case however there are many attachments and clips that have no organization. I would expect that there would be a slot or compartment for each of those things but there wasn&#x27;t. I am kind of an organizational freak I guess but I was hoping for a more professional style case in which to store my clipper. Make sure you read the instructions because there is a setting that needs to be adjusted before use as well as lubricating the blades.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was prompt and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. Great service and delivery.</li>
    <li> I have used these several dozen of times, they work great and my family is very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It works very well and have instruction can help</li>
    <li> My husband loves his tools, it does a great job.</li>
    <li> works well, but the shortest (without any guides) is still a bit long to trim my beard.</li>
    <li> This has been a great set.  I have do a lot of hair cuts with 4 boys and a husband.  This set has been great, and very used.</li>
    <li> Cuts through my thick hair with ease. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a hair cutting kit.</li>
    <li> But I&#x27;m not lying! I did it myself and it looks like it!  GADS ZOOKS! I love it. Great product!  Move over Nick Nolte!</li>
    <li> We have only used this item twice but it seems to work very well cutting hair. We looked at the savings for what we paid and it&#x27;s already paid for itself 50%. My wife had never cut hair before and she did a wonderful job for her first haircut.</li>
    <li> As described. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> Love them it was a great purchase can not beat the price they get the job done what more can I say saves me a trip to the barber shop twice a month</li>
    <li> Cuts well, has many sizes so thats a plus. I didn&#x27;t like the carrying case or the scissors and what not, but I already had my own so that wasn&#x27;t a big deal at all. Overall its a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Pefect replacment for my 8 yr old set. Nice and sharp comes a lot of clipper guards. Back in Business!!!!</li>
    <li> Used it twice on my husband and it works great. My husband likes it. It&#x27;s a hair cutter of course it&#x27;s going to make some noise. The cape is made from cheap material, it&#x27;s like those white thin trash bag. But so far, I like the kit. It&#x27;s neatly packed and I haven&#x27;t use all the attachments yet.</li>
    <li> Outstanding clipper set!</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this!!  Great price</li>
    <li> Good product, lots of guards, Great for cutting my sons hair.  High quality.</li>
    <li> Does all it says it will do. Attachments work very well, fit and finish is excellent, and battery life is good.</li>
    <li> So, the haircut kit arrived the last week, and I gave myself my first haircut (which wasn&#x27;t much more than a buzz cut, as I made the mistake of forgetting to replace the bit halfway through, after brushing some hair off the clipper. HAHA)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, I have only used it once, so I&#x27;m still unsure of its longevity. But so far I am very pleased. It works well, feels weighty, and durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;time will tell on the how well and how long it remains functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shout out to HPP enterprises for the quick and safe shipping!!</li>
    <li> I posted this review inadvertently on the other model of the chrome pro, but this pair is the pair I actually have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since my favorite barber moved out of town, I have used these clippers to cut my hair. I thought, if this new guy is only going to use clippers, not scissors, I can do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was almost two years ago. I had a few people cut my hair for me, but it was not convenient working with their schedules and mine, so I went at it after a couple months. Now I shower in the morning, then cut my hair, then jump back into the shower to get all of the hair off of me. And these clippers just work. My girlfriend preferred when I had hair a bit longer on top than the #8 guards give, so I went to the wahl online store and ordered the #10 and #12 clipper guards. The #12 is a bit long for what I want, but the #10 are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to the barber, I cut my hair every 6 weeks. Since buying these, I have cut my hair every 4 to 5 weeks. I can trim my armpit and other hair as well very quickly. When I added it up, at just shy of 2 years into these clippers, at $15 per hair cut, I have saved approximately $315. Then factoring in the gas it took to get to the barber shop, I have saved about $350. Minus the price of the clippers, and the two extra guards, I have a net total of about $325 saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is on the fence about getting these (or the other equivalent Wahl models), get them! You can learn to cut your own hair easily. And I highly recommend getting the Wahl corded clippers instead of the battery powered ones from any brand. The battery powered ones are more convenient, but the battery does not hold up well at all in the other brands that I&#x27;ve used. The others are underpowered and these ones are just much much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers complain about this thing missing hair, but what do they expect? Do they think if you touch a pair of clippers to your hair, your hair will be perfectly trimmed in onepass? Of course hair will lay flat and not get cut the first time, You have to go over the hair in multiple directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have said that the guards are flimsy, but you don&#x27;t need to add pressure to hold these to your head. Gravity will take care of that just fine. My #12 guard feels flimsy, but even the #10 feels sturdy enough to not end up with uneven hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl products are made in the USA, which I like, but also, you can buy replacement parts if yours fails or breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these!</li>
    <li> Love Wahl products. Have been buying them exclusively for 10 years and will not use another brand. Have not paid for a haircut in 10 years. Only downside is the life expectancy of these trimmers is ~3-4 years which is not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> A hole in your head, or hair, is exactly what you&#x27;ll get when the plastic attachment guide falls off in the middle of your haircut (yes, it really happened). This is a serious design flaw with the clippers.  The attachment guide simply weakens over time and the vibration of the clippers knocks it right off.  Unacceptable.</li>
    <li> the box was broken.but the stuff inside are ok</li>
    <li> Great haircut kit for the price, It had all the the important guards for the clipper.</li>
    <li> I just have my fiance in the house, and he uses this to keep trimmed. Once his friends saw how well it worked, I found myself doing their hair, too. Like others have mentioned, the box is disorganized. I recommend using labels and ziploc bags to keep the more used extensions seperate. I adore this product!</li>
    <li> GREAT BRAND AND PRODUCT. WORKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on and off for a number of years now. Very pleased with the product. Built well, works great. Would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that an electric connection is needed in the vicinity. But thats not a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these about 14 years ago when I lost a job and figured I needed to cut my expenses. (pun intended)  I don&#x27;t mind a pretty simple style for my hair, I start with the 1/2&amp;#34; comb all over, do the 3/8&amp;#34; about 3/4 up the sides, do the 1/4&amp;#34; for the bottom of the back, then hit each side above the ears with the wedge combs in each direction. The 1/8&amp;#34; finishes the edges. Takes all of 15 minutes at the most and nobody has ever accused me of having a bad haircut. Since I bought this set on sale it was about the same price I had been paying for a haircut and tip once a month.&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re slow on math that&#x27;s $3,360.00 I&#x27;ve saved skipping the old haircut place. Even better I can do it whenever I want rather than when I have time to stop by and maybe have to wait for a chair.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the cutters clean and oiled and it will probably last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Still have it and it works as well as it should. Comes with blade lubricant and everything needed to maintain said clippers if you know how to. It&#x27;s been about 3 months and it still works totally fine.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality product for the price. It paid for itself the first day I used it (3 boys&#x27; haircuts). Good power, blades came sharp and well aligned. Lots of accessory blade guides (some I won&#x27;t even use) and it did come with a little bottle of blade oil, which was nice. I would definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you need to do basic hair cuts.  The clipper itself is quality made,&lt;br /&gt;quiet,  and will last a LONG time.  (you just need to clean it out and oil it once in a while).&lt;br /&gt;The instruction sheet is very clear.  For just a few dollars more than the dollar store brand, you get the real thing&lt;br /&gt;and it will last.</li>
    <li> Great kit and inexpensive. Wahl is as good as it gets for razors.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s nicely. While the &#x27;buzzer&#x27; as we call it, isn&#x27;t overly loud it was too intense for my four year old son. I used the scissors to cut my son&#x27;s hair. They worked beautifully. What didn&#x27;t was the &#x27;cape&#x27; that they provided. When I went to put it on my son, the string broke. I wasn&#x27;t pulling hard. It just broke as I tried to tie it to stay on him. Everything works well, just some feel very cheap, especially the cape provided. I&#x27;ll get a better quality one elsewhere that we&#x27;ll use more often.</li>
    <li> I love these cutters. They are very powerful, yet smooth to use. I wish it would have came with a carrying case. Other than that, I am very pleased. Thanks,  Ray</li>
    <li> I plan on getting an identical replacement for this product, because it seems well-built and comes with a 5-year warranty. Unfortunately, one of the guards and the carrying case were broken when it arrived. It&#x27;s hard to know whether the fault lies with Amazon, USPS, or Wahl, but regardless, it&#x27;s a drag to deal with.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer because I have had great experience with Wahl in the past. However, I am grossly disappointed in this version of the product. Here are a few of my grievances:&lt;br /&gt;1. Noisy: contrary to some of it&#x27;s predecessor this machine is noisy. I had dual purpose in mind i.e. trimming my beard as well as a haircut/ trim of my infant&#x27;s head. However, with the noise it is impossible to trim his hair even when he is asleep.&lt;br /&gt;2. Vibration: the machine has a strong vibration. So much so, that the hand start to hurt after 6-8 minutes of trimming&lt;br /&gt;3. Loose pieces: a couple of pieces don&#x27;t fit well on the machine. Most notably, piece #2, in make case was a waste as it wouldn&#x27;t grip on the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a two star because despite the problems mentioned above, I am able to use it. It is good for a quick trim that lasts less than 5 mins and doesn&#x27;t require to use the loose piece.</li>
    <li> My wife now cuts my hair because we realized she can do as good a job (if not better) than any of the local, no appointment needed &amp;#34;Hair Massacre&amp;#34; places.  This kit has it all and after 10+ cuts is something I&#x27;m really glad to have purchased.  Five stars stand...though I must say the cape they provide is no better than grocery store plastic bag material.  Also, the freebie scissors are not the greatest (not sharp)...but hey, it&#x27;s all free with the kit so I&#x27;m not complaining!  If you have someone at home willing to cut your hair (that you trust) this is an excellent way to save some money on basic hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Everything is awesome but like other reviews the scissors are just a joke jaha but hey! They work for tiny bits of trimming.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair cutting set to start cutting my own hair, as my hair is thinning on top and I wanted to tailor my haircuts more to my own liking. I am amazed at how well this set works. I was afraid that my haircuts would look unprofessional. But that has not been the case. The set is easy to use, has tons of attachments and the end result actually looks very professional. I have been using the set every week now to just touch up my hair and keep it looking fresh. The set is very solid and durable to handle and is not a cheap haircutting system at all. It looks like a set a professional might use. I highly recommend.</li>

    <li> Best I&#x27;ve had so far, and I&#x27;ve had 4 in the last 15 years. Lots of accessories and no hair pulling</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of clippers that were locally available, decided on these. First time cutting my own hair and after doing it, can&#x27;t believe it took me this long.&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions and found they were ready to start cutting right out of the box. My hair was about 3-3 1/2&amp;#34; long and the clippers cut it down to a &amp;#34;#3&amp;#34; with ease.  Blades are sharp, attachments snap on easily, and they give you all the accessories most people would ever need.&lt;br /&gt;Everything fits loose in the case, as others have mentioned. I can tell Wahl did this to fit it all in a nice, small case that won&#x27;t take up much room while you store it away.</li>
    <li> great product!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and he seems to like it. He has already used it once and been happy with the result.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair cutter! Works easy and does an awesome job for cutting hair at the house! My boyfriend loves it! Great quality!</li>
    <li> They sent me this product inperfect condicions and in just moment, this Haircut is perfert for me. I like it</li>
    <li> Exactly what we expected.  Trimmed the hair and all of the attachments give different options of length. Fits our need perfectly.</li>
    <li> I looked into options and found this to be the best value for my money.  My husband absolutely loves it.  I&#x27;d get it again.</li>
    <li> Bought a Wahl after consulting with professionals, did my homework on all the sites and got what I thought was a decent deal...Until I used it on my son&#x27;s long hair to buzz cut request.  Bogged down and grabbed his hair, pulling it and causing PAIN.  I had to cut an area of inch at a time.  Now I had an Oster for 22 years and the cord gave out, but I never had a problem like this!  Weak motor!  Not happy and not worth the $50 I dropped on it, either.  Stick to the cheaper models unless you really need all the attachments they provide in this one.  By the way, used it on my own hair, 1.5\\&quot; pre-cut length and it pulled mine as well.  The only time this thing works as advertised is if your hair is short to begin with and you are maintenance cutting.</li>
