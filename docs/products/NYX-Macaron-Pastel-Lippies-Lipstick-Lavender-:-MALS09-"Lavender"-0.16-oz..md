### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect if you want opaque lavender lips.</li>
      <li>Best lipstick 💄 everrr</li>
      <li>Perfect condition.</li>
      <li>love the color of this lipstick!!!</li>
      <li>This is beautiful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cute and has been one of the best &amp;#34;crazier&amp;#34; lip colors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>So happy with my purchase..</li>
      <li>Great for spring</li>
      <li>These lipsticks can vary a great deal in opacity and consistency depending on the color.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colors to play with, and it goes on perfect and velvety every time.</li>
      <li>The colour is nice and a great dupe for limecrime.</li>
      <li>Good lipstick</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick!</li>
      <li>Amazing color for spring</li>
      <li>Applies nicely.</li>
      <li>Goes on beautifully and the lavender color is true to color.</li>
      <li>it goes on kind of chalky.</li>
      <li>It also applies very easily.</li>
      <li>the color is ok, it kind of has a bluish tint to it.</li>
      <li>The pigmentation is great and this looks nice over a dark purple stain I have as an ombre look; however I am somewhat hesitant to wear it alone as I am very fair skinned and it makes my lips almost disappear.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a rich bright lavender.</li>
      <li>It applies as a very light lavender color.</li>
      <li>I love NYX just not this collection.</li>
      <li>update review, if I feel the need, and once I play around with it more.</li>
      <li>The most wearable out of all the Macaron Lippies.</li>
      <li>Its okay.</li>
      <li>I love this s</li>
      <li>I recommend anyone to try it out :)</li>
      <li>Love wearing it with Temptress.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you exfoliate your lips</li>
      <li>put some setting powder on top to turn it into a matte lip stick and the finish is MUCH better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful shade and it has a nice scent to it.</li>
      <li>Really bright but pretty purple.</li>
      <li>The lipstick is very creamy which i think its a good thing it just that the color in the picture is not the one you will get</li>
      <li>LOVE the color and its super creamy</li>
      <li>Matte lipsticks are better for bright colors such as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>that being said I do not recommend this shade if you are light skinned, unless you are going for the &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t breath look&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;Guess</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy wearing it.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely buy more.</li>
      <li>However, this color offers true opaque coverage which was nice.  </li>
      <li>These Macaron lippies are a great way to experiment with new wild colored lipstick trend without breaking the bank.  </li>
      <li>It also comes off pretty easily.</li>
      <li>Only if you love to stand out and love bold lip colors.</li>
      <li>I think this particular color would look stunning on a darker skin tone.</li>
      <li>lipstick is ok, as far as quality.</li>
      <li>right.</li>
      <li>The color was vibrant and creamy!!</li>
      <li>I hope that NYX comes out with more colors in the future!</li>
      <li>Pretty creamy, won&#x27;t buy from this collection again.</li>
      <li>well first.</li>
      <li>Love it 💕💕💕 its glossy but lasts long</li>
      <li>I was looking for this color for a long time, glad I found it</li>
      <li>A little lighter than it looks but amazing feel and look</li>
      <li>and this lipstick is very pigmented</li>
      <li>Haha.</li>
      <li>I really felt like I was Nicki.</li>
      <li>Absolutely InLove with this Lippie..</li>
      <li>The color is much lighter than the picture on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the color is much more snowcone blue than lavender.</li>
      <li>.. stays on well, and gives me a unique edge to blend with other lipsticks, and make pretty fall ombre lips with a darker purple.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to blend with other lip colors for a gradient effect.</li>
      <li>You need to apply several coats to get the lavender color, otherwise it has more of a grey tint to it.</li>
      <li>I like wearing this on normal going out nights too, not just when I feel like trying to be Nicki Minaj.</li>
      <li>So firstly, 5 stars on how fast their shipping is, definitely</li>
      <li>(Maybelline makes a clear one I am going to try.)</li>
      <li>This is a whole different colo not the one shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>This particular color &amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34; did not work that well for me personally.</li>
      <li>It goes on a bit sheer and requires layers and reapplication, however it&#x27;s a fun and hard to find colour</li>

    <li> This lipstick is surprisingly thick and it&#x27;s a rich bright lavender. It&#x27;s very cute and has been one of the best &amp;#34;crazier&amp;#34; lip colors I&#x27;ve used. Applies nicely.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful. Love wearing it with Temptress. (:</li>
    <li> The color is much lighter than the picture on Amazon.  It goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this s***. I dressed up like Nicki Minaj for Halloween and wore this lipstick. I really felt like I was Nicki. I like wearing this on normal going out nights too, not just when I feel like trying to be Nicki Minaj. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Really bright but pretty purple. The most wearable out of all the Macaron Lippies.</li>
    <li> Always like atypical lipstick shades. I was looking for this color for a long time, glad I found it</li>
    <li> You need to apply several coats to get the lavender color, otherwise it has more of a grey tint to it. It also comes off pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Perfect condition. Good lipstick</li>
    <li> Amazing color for spring</li>
    <li> These Macaron lippies are a great way to experiment with new wild colored lipstick trend without breaking the bank.  These lipsticks can vary a great deal in opacity and consistency depending on the color. This particular color &amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34; did not work that well for me personally. It applies as a very light lavender color. The color just did not flatter me and the finish seemed a little chalky. However, this color offers true opaque coverage which was nice.  I tried it on without a lipliner but I definitely think it would benefit from one (Maybelline makes a clear one I am going to try.) I will also try a lip primer of some sort in the future. The retail price for these is about $6 which is far less expensive than other lipsticks of this type.  I hope that NYX comes out with more colors in the future!</li>
    <li> This is a whole different colo not the one shown in the picture. The lipstick is very creamy which i think its a good thing it just that the color in the picture is not the one you will get</li>
    <li> Perfect if you want opaque lavender lips. Just make sure you exfoliate your lips well first.</li>
    <li> Not the color I expected. A lot lighter then in the picture.</li>
    <li> Absolutely InLove with this Lippie.. Was looking for something out of my comfort zone to try out and this Lipstick definitely did the job right. So happy with my purchase..</li>
    <li> Its comes a lot brighter and I do not like it</li>
    <li> A little lighter than it looks but amazing feel and look</li>
    <li> Its okay. You definitely have to work with it and tone it down. Depending on your skin tone. Not everyone can rock it. Only if you love to stand out and love bold lip colors. Great for spring</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colors to play with, and it goes on perfect and velvety every time. The color comes out stronger if you line and fill in lips with a white lip pencil. It is also easy to blend with other lip colors for a gradient effect.</li>
    <li> Best lipstick 💄 everrr</li>
    <li> This is a lot brighter than I expected and I have used a lavender lipstick before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cream lipstick and will have a finish that may not be all that flattering. Matte lipsticks are better for bright colors such as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some setting powder on top to turn it into a matte lip stick and the finish is MUCH better.</li>
    <li> Love it 💕💕💕 its glossy but lasts long</li>
    <li> love the color of this lipstick!!! very comparable to lime crime, without the crazy cost.. and this lipstick is very pigmented.. stays on well, and gives me a unique edge to blend with other lipsticks, and make pretty fall ombre lips with a darker purple.</li>
    <li> i bought this to wear to a concert. the color is ok, it kind of has a bluish tint to it. it goes on kind of chalky.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick! Goes on beautifully and the lavender color is true to color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a beautiful shade and it has a nice scent to it. It also applies very easily. I recommend anyone to try it out :)</li>
    <li> LOVE the color and its super creamy</li>
    <li> The color was vibrant and creamy!! I eventually ordered the rest of the colors in this collection!!</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the color is much more snowcone blue than lavender. But other than that it&#x27;s pigmented and lasts long. Pretty creamy, won&#x27;t buy from this collection again. I love NYX just not this collection.</li>

    <li> So firstly, 5 stars on how fast their shipping is, definitely excellent!&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick is ok, as far as quality.

Haha. If you have a darker complexion, give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll pair it with something else? We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;Will update review, if I feel the need, and once I play around with it more.</li>
