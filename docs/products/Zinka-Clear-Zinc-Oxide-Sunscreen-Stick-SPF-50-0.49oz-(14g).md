      <li>I was thrilled it was clear!</li>
      <li>This is, by far, my favorite face sunblock!</li>
      <li>I had wanted to use it on my chest as well, but went for another brand because it would take too much of the product to cover a large area &amp; not be cost effective.</li>
      <li>Super convenient to use.  </li>
      <li>It goes on clear which I love and</li>
      <li>The clear formula is fabulous!</li>
      <li>I ordered some from here right away.  </li>
      <li>so I put make up on right over it.</li>
      <li>being a major outdoor person, i have tried many sunscreens.  </li>

      <li>This Zinc Oxide Sunscreen goes on clear and easily.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and clear!</li>
      <li>My first reaction was, &amp;#34;are</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased similar sticks for a lot more then this one cost.</li>
      <li>First off I do like the product</li>
      <li>This year I didn&#x27;t have any at the beginning of the season and my son got really burned</li>
      <li>highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The others were lower spf in addition to being like twice as much.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes like many other brands</li>
      <li>your face in even harsh&lt;br /&gt;uv-rays for a decent period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a problem with zinka!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a sunscreen with high SPF that I could use on my face without having to worry about it stinging my eyes once I start sweating.</li>
      <li>expensive but works great</li>
      <li>Super easy to apply, even to my kids&#x27; faces, due to its wide shape.</li>
      <li>Goes on clear!</li>
      <li>The first is that I am using this not for surfing but for my outside job.</li>

      <li>I had no issues with this product stinging my eyes, it completely protected me from any sun &amp; had no odor.</li>
      <li>i have found so far.  </li>
      <li>I also used it, i have a natural tan color and it also blends well to my face.</li>
      <li>It shielded me from hot sun fairly, but not as well as No-Ad sunscreen of the same SPF, which was disappointing.  </li>
      <li>First time I haven&#x27;t left the beach without a red noise like Rudolph!</li>
      <li>It came quickly and even with the shipping cost, it was about .05 less than at the surf shop.  </li>
      <li>I live in the Central Valley of CA where the summers get up to 112 degrees.</li>
      <li>I started getting dark spots on my cheeks and was stressing over how to enjoy outdoor sports while avoiding getting dark spots.</li>
      <li>The cost for the product compared to other products is high.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased similar sticks for a lot more then this one cost. The others were lower spf in addition to being like twice as much. This was everything I was hoping it would be .</li>
    <li> Easy, easy, easy to use.  What a relief to not have to rub liquid sunscreen on my son&#x27;s face anymore.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware, this is not Broad Spectrum which means it has UVA/UVB protection.</li>
    <li> Wow! Goes on smooth and clear! Love this!!</li>
    <li> I am avoiding chemicals on the skin and the micronized sunscreens are supposed to reflect sun and be the best for my fair skin.  Super convenient to use.  I was thrilled it was clear!</li>
    <li> Works great, I have had skin cancer on my nose, so I needed a good sunscreen, and this stuff works great, have not been burned at all since using it.</li>
    <li> expensive but works great</li>
    <li> First off I do like the product I&lt;br /&gt;Ordered three, and the product does work well. I have two issues, one of them is probably unique to me. The first is that I am using this not for surfing but for my outside job. this stuff makes your face sweat like crazy which for me is a big downside, when I am surfing this is not an issue at all. Secondly the amount is pretty small but it goes a long way. It goes a long way with this one disclaimer; if you have not shaved the day that you apply this stuff your scruff or whatever you want to call it will soak this stuff up and you will be wasting a lot. If your face is newly shaved you will reduce the amount of waste. So if you are like me and try not to shave everyday than it is something to consider. I haven&#x27;t found a better product without these issues but I am going to keep looking.</li>
    <li> Zinka Clear Zinc Oxide works great.  Goes on clear.  Smells good but not overpowering.  Only complaint is I wish it were larger...</li>
    <li> Great stuff....very nice on the skin and provides protection that is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Went on clear for me though I&#x27;m pretty pale, and I didn&#x27;t get burned while surfing (I usually do!). Love this product, so easy to apply - doesn&#x27;t get your hands all sticky.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, my favorite face sunblock! I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a problem with zinka! I use it on the kids too, never a problem. The clear formula is fabulous! I never worry that I have white streaks all over my face! Best in my book!</li>
    <li> thought it was abody stick looked much larger in picture than when i recived it was actually a small face stick</li>
    <li> I started getting dark spots on my cheeks and was stressing over how to enjoy outdoor sports while avoiding getting dark spots. I was using all levels of SPF and brands of sunblock.  THIS IS IT!!!  I apply it on my cheeks every morning and reapply if I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun at all.  It goes on clear so I put make up on right over it. I keep a stick in the restroom, one in my purse, and one in my workout bag. Not only have I avoided having the spots get darker, the spots I did have have actually gotten lighter because of the protection!</li>
    <li> I originally found this on vacation at OBX.  It is the only stuff that works on my son&#x27;s face.  It goes on clear which I love and the stick makes it super fast to apply.  This year I didn&#x27;t have any at the beginning of the season and my son got really burned so I went and bought some...we were sharing that OBX house with other families and all the other moms used it for their kids for the rest of the week.  As soon as I got home, I realized ours was almost gone because of it&#x27;s communal use :)  I ordered some from here right away.  It came quickly and even with the shipping cost, it was about .05 less than at the surf shop.  1 stick will typically last 1 child the entire summer.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This to stuff is great! It doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes like many other brands do once you get wet or start to sweat. Super easy to apply, even to my kids&#x27; faces, due to its wide shape. It&#x27;s the only face stick I buy!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunscreen with high SPF that I could use on my face without having to worry about it stinging my eyes once I start sweating. I live in the Central Valley of CA where the summers get up to 112 degrees. I do my running in the morning but the direct sun still hits me when doing my hills &amp; I have had several pre cancerous lesions removed in the past few years so I have to be extra cautious. I had no issues with this product stinging my eyes, it completely protected me from any sun &amp; had no odor. My only complaint is that the amount of product you get for the price is not economical. I had wanted to use it on my chest as well, but went for another brand because it would take too much of the product to cover a large area &amp; not be cost effective.</li>
    <li> Rubs on well.  Hasn&#x27;t dried out like a few other brands I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Great option for younger kids to apply for themselves, and my niece loves it. She says it smells like cookie dough.</li>
    <li> I wore this for 4 hours of surfing.  First time I haven&#x27;t left the beach without a red noise like Rudolph!</li>
    <li> Easy application to face and fits in your pocket. Keeps the sun off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It is a lot smaller than expected, read the size before buying</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten burned yet since wearing this on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the sun, in the ocean just about every day&lt;br /&gt;This will become my staple (Especially since the Shisedo version costs almost $40</li>
    <li> This Zinc Oxide Sunscreen goes on clear and easily.  This is the best part of it.  It shielded me from hot sun fairly, but not as well as No-Ad sunscreen of the same SPF, which was disappointing.  I was expecting a total blockage effect. My eyes still stung from it after swimming for 30 minutes.  The &amp;#34;teeny weeny&amp;#34; size (smaller than a travel size equivalent to a &amp;#34;trial size&amp;#34; -- was disappointing).  My first reaction was, &amp;#34;are you kidding me?&amp;#34;  Not cheap either at $11.00.  Not a value purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband who works outside in Florida 12 hours a day!! the item arrived before the expected date and was exactly as described!  I couldnt be happier, he loves it and says it works great, he notices the difference between that and regular suncreen products that are often greasy and &amp;#34;melt off&amp;#34;after just 15 or 20 minutes,  great stuff!!  you ought to sell it in bulk!! :).</li>
    <li> This is by far the best face stick i have ever used.  being a major outdoor person, i have tried many sunscreens.  i switched to face sticks about 2 years ago being that it is so easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t get all over you hands.  i just found this stuff about 2 weeks ago and it ROCKS.  by far the best sunscreen stick i have found so far.  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Really small amount of product for the cost. The big problem is that is very small, in the picture looks biger but you need to realize the product will be small</li>
    <li> Daily surfer and this stays on long time, replacement for vertra. Good value, been using fior years.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> Portable, and small.  Good size for children&#x27;s hands to put on their own sunblock exactly where they want to.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen stick is small and convenient for travel. It is as advertised and I would recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> A fun way to carry sunscreen,&lt;br /&gt;non-messy, smells good and&lt;br /&gt;protects your face in even harsh&lt;br /&gt;uv-rays for a decent period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! No OXYBENZONE!!! Great smell, no taste. I am able to use it all over. Would love to see them make a sunscreen spray by the time summer gets here again.</li>
    <li> I did not look at the size of the product and was amazed when it came in.  The cost for the product compared to other products is high.  The product worked well however make sure to verify the size before ordering.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Goes on clear!</li>
    <li> easy to apply and protects well. always loved the colored zinka sunscreens and love the clear even more! very good.</li>
    <li> Zinc is a great way to protect your face from the sun. No more crazy colored zinc use the clear kind!</li>
    <li> Not 100% zinc, contains hidden chemicals and other artificial ingredients</li>
    <li> Well As always the Amazon delivery and price is great!&lt;br /&gt;About the product: The cream/stick is very good, works well and smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;The big problem is that is very small, in the picture looks biger but you need to realize the product will be small.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my bf who is a captain and a surfer. He is always expose to the sun. He loves it, white stuff doesn&#x27;t smudge his face...blends perfectly to his white/tanned face. I also used it, i have a natural tan color and it also blends well to my face. Doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin. Amazing size for the pocket.</li>
