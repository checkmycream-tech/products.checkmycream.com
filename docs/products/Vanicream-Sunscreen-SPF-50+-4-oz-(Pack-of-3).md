      <li>Good</li>
      <li>I Loved the SPF 60 and have used it for years.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
      <li>And also I love spf 50 formula better than spf 60 which was kind of greasy.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t rub in as well, and was more visible on the skin.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>One of the best sunscreen we had used especially on your face.</li>
      <li>And most importantly,  your goal as a patient is to avoid color.</li>
      <li>Wonderful to have an option without harming her skin as other sunscreens do.</li>
      <li>It is good but it leaves a white film on the skin making a ghosty look.</li>
      <li>This one is light and powerful.</li>
      <li>Excellent product that should come in bigger packages at bulk price, especially with the harmful effects of sun exposure.</li>
      <li>Fantastic sunscreen for those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>First off, I&#x27;m a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>Really protects well!</li>
      <li>I tried vanicream twice when I was out on the sun for the whole day(85 degrees).</li>
      <li>unless you&#x27;re more careful in application.  </li>
      <li>So the moisturizer with sunscreens didn&#x27;t work that much started getting sun tan and burns.</li>
      <li>This should be everyone&#x27;s main concern and goal.</li>
      <li>I normally use the ones that comes with moisturizer never tried a separate sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Worth the extra $$.</li>
      <li>Recently started using a cleanser which makes my skin super sensitive to sun.</li>
      <li>The 50 spf is much thinner and no different than so many other brands.</li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t live overseas I&#x27;d return all 3 tubes.</li>
      <li>Live up in the mountains and we get a lot of sun.  </li>
      <li>i have very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>So far works well, waiting for the summer sun test.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Surprised to see I didn&#x27;t get any suntan.</li>
      <li>The new product is a very different texture from the old.  </li>
      <li>Vain cream changed the formula and the new cream has a white screen to it that make you look like a ghost</li>
      <li>The Vanicream 50 spf is not the same as the old 60 spf.  </li>
      <li>It does leave a white residue when it&#x27;s applied, but I find that usually goes away as the sunscreen is absorbed into the skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love it. Every Sunscreen is too greasy on my skin and makes me break out. This one is light and powerful.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product as SPF60.  The ingredients list has changed in the active and inactive ingredients- it does not go,on the same nor does it soak into my skin the same.  The overall consistency is different.  Their labeling &amp;#34;formally SPF 60&amp;#34; is misleading and should be e moved from their description - false advertising......</li>
    <li> Prescribed by my dermatologist. This is the only sunscreen I can use on my face and neck. Good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price on this product is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever. Recommended by my dermatologist and it works so well. Has zinc so must be rubbed in well or white stays. But excellent!</li>
    <li> works well, skin feels good when use it</li>
    <li> Excellent product that should come in bigger packages at bulk price, especially with the harmful effects of sun exposure. prompt delivery</li>
    <li> This product listing is misleading.  The Vanicream 50 spf is not the same as the old 60 spf.  It is an entirely different formula.  The text in this listing is written for the old product, which means all the information is wrong.  Go to the Vanicream Website for a correct list of ingredients for the spf 50.  The new product is a very different texture from the old.  I was a big fan of the 60, but I dislike the 50.  It didn&#x27;t rub in as well, and was more visible on the skin.</li>
    <li> I use spf 60 for my kid as per her dermatologist recommendation.I normally use the ones that comes with moisturizer never tried a separate sunscreen. Recently started using a cleanser which makes my skin super sensitive to sun. So the moisturizer with sunscreens didn&#x27;t work that much started getting sun tan and burns. So I tried clarins sunscreen spf 40. It is good but it leaves a white film on the skin making a ghosty look. Then I was checking for the ingredients and noticed both clarins and vanicream spf 50 have same active ingredient . In addition vanicream has zinc oxide too. I tried vanicream twice when I was out on the sun for the whole day(85 degrees). Surprised to see I didn&#x27;t get any suntan. And also I love spf 50 formula better than spf 60 which was kind of greasy. This spf 50 is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the 60 spf Vanicream for years.  I am so very disappointed in the change to 50 spf.  If I didn&#x27;t live overseas I&#x27;d return all 3 tubes. The 60 spf was thick and creamy and it covered my skin damage well.  The 50 spf is much thinner and no different than so many other brands.</li>
    <li> I have use this product for several years and I like it. It does leave a white residue when it&#x27;s applied, but I find that usually goes away as the sunscreen is absorbed into the skin.</li>
    <li> Vain cream changed the formula and the new cream has a white screen to it that make you look like a ghost</li>
    <li> the Vanicream I have used in the past did not leave a white film on everything. The current&lt;br /&gt;batch does. I have white smudges on my furniture and car</li>
    <li> Really protects well! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that it is SO thick that a white film remains (all day!) unless you&#x27;re more careful in application.  Just what my poor skin needs in this year-round Florida sun.</li>
    <li> Fantastic sunscreen for those of us with sensitive skin. Recommended by my dermatologist as well as my grandson&#x27;s dermatologist. Other sunscreens gave us both a red bumpy rash. Vanicream was prescribed over 5 years ago and will only use this product. I apply Vanicream as my morning moisturizer then apply makeup. Hard to find outside the internet. Worth the extra $$.</li>
    <li> Very good protection and it does indeed vanish into your skin. I have some other sunscreens that &amp;#34;bunch&amp;#34; in the creases of my arms after an hour or two. This stays put and forms an invisible barrier to the sun&#x27;s harmful rays. I use it on the areas that need the highest level of protection without looking white or pastey.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m a dermatologist. Yes, it will appear whiter than others when applied to your skin. However, I&#x27;ve not yet seen an allergic reaction to this. And most importantly,  your goal as a patient is to avoid color. If you are not getting color (tan), your sunscreen is working and you are applying it correctly.  This should be everyone&#x27;s main concern and goal. By the way, if u can tan without burning, that is like saying u can smoke without coughing.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use regular sunscreens because they make my skin itch.  This sunscreen has been used for weeks with no problems.</li>
    <li> I had some itchiness which I felt was from my sunscreen.  My dermatologist suggested I tried Vanicream, and NO ITCHINESS!</li>
    <li> great product, works well and doesn&#x27;t give you breakouts.</li>
    <li> i have very sensitive skin.  this product is great and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  i get lots of compliments on my &amp;#34;gorgeous skin&amp;#34; when i&#x27;m wearing it!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! Perfect for my daughter with severe allergies and eczema.  Wonderful to have an option without harming her skin as other sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product. I Loved the SPF 60 and have used it for years. This product leaves me looking like a ghost. I will Never purchase it again!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Use a little so not sure yet</li>
    <li> Live up in the mountains and we get a lot of sun.  One of the best sunscreen we had used especially on your face.</li>
    <li> So far works well, waiting for the summer sun test.</li>
