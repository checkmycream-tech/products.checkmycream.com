<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am unable to purchase these x-large cloths in my hometown.  Therefore I am so glad Amazon has them.  They are great for all hard surface floors and get up much more dust and dog hair than a broom or vacuum.</li>
    <li> Once you use the Swiffer Max, you will never pick up the regular one again!  However, the lack of availability of these worries me...  Hope they do not discontinue them.</li>
    <li> Cannot find this large size cloth in my local stores anymore.  With lots of hardwood, this cuts down on sweeping time!  Glad I can still find them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> What can you say about refills?  They work.  I can&#x27;t understand why everybody doesn&#x27;t use the XL version since it covers twice as much area - cut your cleaning time in half.</li>
    <li> perfect fro hard floor! Forget the vacuum cleaner!</li>
    <li> I have a large photography studio and the regular Swiffers just weren&#x27;t hacking it. This takes half the time to dust the floors. Most of the studio is covered in high end vinyl and these x-large Swiffers are great, except in places like the bath room where around the toilet is a little tight. I tried the more expensive microfiber broom covers, but you have to constantly wash them, which is a pain. Safe the hassle and get these.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 10 years and have never been disappointed in the results.  I am unhappy that it is not readily available in stores convenient to my regular shopping area, but was pleased to be able to order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the extra large disposable cloths many times...although they are larger than the swiffer mop, I prefer the extra cleaning space...instead of the dust on the floor..it sticks to the cloth ...&lt;br /&gt;It would be great if the swiffer mop came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> When my house was rebuilt with hardwood laminate floors, the contractor left one of these swiffers behind. We couldn&#x27;t find any replacement cloths locally and really liked them. I was able to find them through Amazon and the price was reasonable. They work great and last a long time. If you&#x27;re looking for these and you have the swiffer, I don&#x27;t need to convince you as you already know. I will and have already purchased more of these and will again when I run out.</li>
    <li> The XL Swiffers are excellent for cleaning stone floors.  I use them in my photography studio, and in my apartment.  I prefer the dry because there is no scent.  I wet them for more efficient and quicker cleaning.  It&#x27;s great to have them available from Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> I have been using these X-Large Sweeping Cloths for 20 years.  The best product for keeping crumbs and dirt off of hardwood floors.</li>
    <li> Love swiffer products</li>
    <li> These are great for people that have the bigger swiffer for larger homes. One day i could not find them in any of the local stores. Was so very glad to find them on Amazon!!!!!</li>
    <li> This hard to find product works as advertised.  Bulk buy is a good deal.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S SWIFFER, AND SWIFFER ONLY!!!! VERY WELL PLEASED.</li>
    <li> This product is a ripe off.they sell u the broom and don&#x27;t even make the wet clothes it.....totally deceiving the consumer..we should all get our money back..</li>
    <li> A larger cloth covers a larger surface area means I&#x27;m finished cleaning sooner. Why these are no longer on the store shelves I have no idea. Happy I could count on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used swiffer&#x27;s since refinishing our hardwood floors and they work great.  When I could no longer get the Swiffer Max in our town I was worried until I found them online and ordering is so easy.</li>
    <li> i used to buy these at a big hardware store (orange logo), but they stopped carrying them. i was thrilled to find these on amazon.com and since then i have taken to purchasing more household cleaning items. i may have to switch entirely to amazon for cleaning items. these swiffers are great for sweeping floors because of their added width compared to the original swiffer pads. i used to have to use two smaller pads on my floor sweep pad for my floors which was inconvenient. i can&#x27;t believe these are not sold at retail stores in my area.</li>
    <li> I was confused on getting replacements for the swiffer max that my wife and I use .... found out that it is now the swiffer xl.  We swear by this product.  It is great for quick dustups between vacuumings and is probably the best on the market for hardwood floors ... it was even recommended to us by a hardwood installer.</li>
    <li> Great for a quick dusting all around my wood floors.  Not a cleaner, but it really picks up the dust!  Use as a dust cloth to dust shutters or anything else,  it really picks up the dust!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> can only get extra large on line  greatly prefer to reg size</li>
    <li> That pretty much says it all.  Prefer the large size to the more compact for the obvious reason.  It simply does MORE.</li>
    <li> I love how fast I received this item. The x-tra large size is hard to find now , and it really takes a lot less time in a large room to sweep the floor!      STacy</li>
    <li> The price of the 3 pack is excellent. One 16 ct box sells at Jewel for $9.</li>
    <li> The extra large size is great for my large house with wood floors.  Buying them in Amazon in this 3-pack is cheaper than buying them from HD (the only retail place locally I&#x27;ve seen them).  HD charges 17.94 for a pack and at the time of this review each box in this 3-pack is just over twelve dollars.</li>
    <li> Swiffer products are a convenient,sanitary way to help keep my house allergy free.  The Swiffer Max cloths that were sent to me were the \\&quot;xtra large\\&quot; ones which covered the Swiffer Max sweeper more fully and were easier to put on than the original Swiffer Max cloths[[ASIN:B000HHPHK4 Swiffer Max Dry Disposable Sweeping Cloths, 16-Count Box (Pack of 3)]].  Buying them on Amazon is much easier than trying to find them in the stores and the value is right.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly into the XL swimmer mop.  They always pick up a lot of dirt and dust, even after I have mopped the floors.  I have used microfibre pads but these work better</li>
    <li> It was difficult to find this product atmaresonale price and we find the size is important to us because of the size of the floor we have and the shedding little monster we call our dog.</li>
    <li> These cloths are handy in a pinch (if you don&#x27;t have time to drag out the vacuum cleaner).  Only down side is they need to be replace quite often to be effective, which gets expensive.</li>
    <li> this has been the only place I can get the large ones.  They fit the Swiffer I bought several years ago and the larger ones are no longer sold in stores it seems.  they work great also.</li>
    <li> These are not sold in any stores around my hometown. My whole house is wood or slate flooring and we have dogs. So these larger cloths make the job easier.</li>
    <li> I do love the X-Large Cloths.  I also, however, feel that the price is a bit high.  I believe more people would buy if priced affordably.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time.  They work beautiful on my hardwood  and tile floors. I just love the X-Large cloths, but I have a hard time finding them in the stores which is why I order them on-line.</li>
    <li> The larger Swiffer sheets make cleaning much easier in a large home.  It&#x27;s great for cleaning up after a shedding dog.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for a large pad like this for a long time.  The large size makes all the difference in the world.</li>
    <li> These larger size cloths cover more area quickly and makes your cleaning a lot easier. Plus you use less of them with the larger cleaning surface.</li>
    <li> The swiffer cloths work great and pick up so much from my wood and tile floors. I use the large and small ones!</li>
    <li> These X-Large dry sweeps are difficult to find in store, but I still like using the dry ones with wood floor cleaner!  These always are extra sturdy and I can get all the wood floors done with one cloth usually.</li>
    <li> I bought the larger swiffer for dusting in the store and now I can&#x27;t find the X-Large sweeping cloths anywhere but online.  I was happy to find them here.  Received them quickly and the bulk rate prevents me from having to buy too often.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Perfect Swiffer refills for the Sweeper x-Large. I will definitely buy more of these in the future!</li>
    <li> If you need a handy floor wiper this is it. The sweeping cloths really clean the floor which is evident from the dirt contained on the cloth during each usage. Easy to use and great results.</li>
    <li> Works great to quickly and easily stay ahead of dog hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great in the sewing room as well for all those cut threads.</li>
    <li> After about ten years the pad the Sweeping Cloth attaches to went bad and needed to be replaced, but the wife and I didn&#x27;t thing twice about replacing it. these things are the nut. The large Sweeping Cloths are not easy to find in stores but Amazon comes through every time.</li>
    <li> My son ordered these for me last time so I tried it...cannot find this item in the stores.  I LOVED the ease of receiving these in the mail.  GREAT JOB</li>
    <li> I really like this product.I have run out and ordered from Amazon. Usually orders ome very primptly; however this has not come as yet .</li>
    <li> We have stained concrete floors throughout our home.  The normal Swiffer just does not handle them.  The X-large does wonders to pick up dirt and dog hair.</li>
    <li> hard to find for large swifter.  Used this swifter for years</li>
    <li> These work so well for the larger Swiffer and they are hard to find in the local stores.  I vacuum them off and use them two or three times before throwing them away since they are not cheap.  They are great for a quick dusting.</li>
    <li> I ordered these sweeper cloths because I couldn&#x27;t find them in any store near my home, and I was tired of using the wimpy small ones. I  thought I could find them online so when I did, I was very pleased.  The quantity and price were right for me!</li>
    <li> Great way to clean up tile floors..</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  especially for pet hair!  There is NOTHING on the market that picks up pet hair like the x-large Swiffer cloths.  The only problem is it was hard to find the X-Large cloths so I purchased on line from amazon.com though Drugrx.  I paid $36 for three boxes.  After the fact, I found out that Lowes sells them and purchased them for $7.29 a box.  I stocked up!!!!!</li>
    <li> Had to purchase via the internet because local stores did not carry item.  The size is great for my needs.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why these things are so hard to find in local stores but I am happy I found them here. I use these all the time and the extra larger size is not stocked in my neighborhood stores. They work and I am not about to change brands based on local availability. Keeps my floors looking great!</li>
    <li> These are great for larger areas.  The Swiffer products are wonderful, I&#x27;m always impressed and shocked at how much dirt they pick up!</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning all types of floors, the cloths are good for dusting and just general heavy duty cleaning.</li>
    <li> Works as advertized. Delivery time and packaging excellent. In the future, definitely will reorder.</li>
    <li> cant live with out them use them everyday</li>
    <li> The problem is Swiffer has discontinued the large size and obsoleted my large size mop-head and its handle.&lt;br /&gt;It appears that when they decided to introduce a wet/dry mop, they used a narrower head that works well for wet mopping, but not so well for dry mopping.  The large size cloths are no longer sold in retail stores, so when I found them on Amazon in three-box cartons, I bought two cartons.  When those are gone, I will throw away my Swiffer mop head and handle a buy another product - probably one with a wash and reuse microfiber cloth.&lt;br /&gt;Swiffer Marketing gets a ONE Star.</li>
    <li> I can only find this size on-line and I&#x27;m glad they are still available. I would buy them again the next time.</li>
    <li> Well if you have a large swiffer you may be like me and bought it several years ago.  I love my sweeper BUT the cloths have really gone down in quality.  If you remember the thick plush feeling and the double sided ones then you may be disappointed.  These are very thin and the waffle part is only on one side.  With that said they still work... and work well so I guess it&#x27;s like most other things and they are trying to cut down on manufacturing costs.  So.. they DO work and I&#x27;ll continue to order them I&#x27;m just a bit disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> So hard to find the X-large in stores. Glad Amazon had it. I give furniture tops a quick dusting before I use it on floors.</li>
    <li> I had given up on finding replacement pads for my Swiffer \\&quot;Max\\&quot;.  Walmart, Target, none of the big-box stores carried them any longer.  Found them here and got a great price.</li>
    <li> The swiffers XL are a great help when you have lots to clean. Wouldn&#x27;t want to miss them. Amazon got them to me at a great price and very fast.  Thank you.   Mrs. V.</li>
    <li> I have a dog who sheds a lot and use the swiffer sweeper XL on my wood floors because of its good ability to trap pet hair, and fine dirt and dust particles.  It works well for every day quick cleanings or as a prep before using a wet cleaner/polish.      Amazon&#x27;s price on these refills is better than what I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere and you can set up a recurring delivery at a discount.  Great service!</li>
    <li> Love them.  I have 2 dogs and need to swifter quite often.  They pick up great and are so easy to use.  I put a little bit of dusting type spray on them and they pick up even more.</li>
    <li> Picks up dust and pet hair very well at our animal hospital!</li>
    <li> Love the product and the larger cloths to fit the larger sweeper.  Great on hardwood floor as it cleans up dust which cloth dust mops leave behind.  With 2 long hair dogs sweeping  is a snap.</li>
    <li> I have tile floors, and I purchased an extra long Swiffer Sweeper to sweep them.&lt;br /&gt;It has been impossible to find the X-Large disposable sweeping cloths in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;So I found them on Amazon, and have been very pleased.When I get down to one box,&lt;br /&gt;I order more boxes. They send them promptly, so I always have them on hand.</li>
    <li> Excellent shipping service. I really like this product. It works well on floors and is easy to use. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in local stores anymore. Have looked and looked. Tried using the smaller ones doubled, but they really don&#x27;t fit. So glad they are still available.</li>
    <li> The  product was what I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought the sweeper because I hate to sweep the floor. I have 2 dogs that shed a lot of hair plus I live in a very windy, dusty area, so the floors need frequent cleaning. My apartment is not very big. Two smal rooms, micro kitchen livingroom( dinning room. I usually do a deep cleaning once a month and just a quick fic weekly. Well, this serves as a quick superficial floor duster. You&#x27;ll still need to use a broom for heavier soil, but this gets the job done (or at least makes my home suitable if we have some surpise visitors</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Swiffer stuff for years.  The &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; size cloths are perfect for our hardwood floors.  This is not a popular size and no one in my neighborhood stocks it.  Amazon and a few other retailers are the only game in town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing the manufacturer won&#x27;t tell you is they are reversible.  One side gets dirty and they want you to throw it out.  Don&#x27;t do that. use the other side, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sweepers work well; exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product arrived promtly and efficiently. I will use this product again when I need to reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> i meant to buy the wet kind.  i didnt realize there was a dry kind.  not sure the point of the dry ones.</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL FOR MY WOOD FLOOR. NOT SURE WHY MOST LOCAL PLACES DON&#x27;T CARRY THEM ANYMORE. I USE IT&lt;br /&gt;WITH MY OLD SWIFFER EXTRA LARGE SWEEPER.. ARRIVED ON TIME WITH NO PROBLEMS.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to purchase this product in our area.  Wife loves the size. Makes cleaning floors much more easy.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t available in stores here in Hawaii, we need the XL sweeper since we have a lot of laminate flooring</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mother, who is a \\&quot;cleaner to top all cleaners\\&quot;.  She absolutely loves this product, and will be certain to buy more.  Thanks for making such a wonderful product available.  (My mom had sent me around town to look for this Swiffer product.  I went to 4 different stores and stopped.  When my mom asked me why I hadn&#x27;t looked in some more stores, I knew it was time to go to Amazon.com!!)  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!  I am on my second Swiffer Sweeper and would hate to do without it. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> THESE CLOTHS ARE WONDERFUL THEY PICK UP ALOT OF DIRT AND HAIR&lt;br /&gt;I AM USING THESE  FOR A VERY LONG TIME&lt;br /&gt;WAS HAVING TROUBL E FINDING THEM IN STORES THAT GOD FOR AMAZON</li>
