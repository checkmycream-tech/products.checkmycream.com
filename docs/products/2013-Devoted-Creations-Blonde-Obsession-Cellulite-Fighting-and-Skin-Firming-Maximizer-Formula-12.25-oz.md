<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing! I always worry that after I get through tanning and go back to work I will have that &amp;#34;tanning bed smell&amp;#34;, but I have only been complimented at how good I smell. Also makes my skin feel smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for almost 6 years (tan obsession). Within the past 6 years I&#x27;ve been through many, many lotions. I just recently seen Blonde Obsession in my salon, so I instantly went home and read millions of reviews. I was very impressed with the reviews so of course I went and bought a sample packet. I am seriously inlove, the smell is great and not too strong. It absorbs into your skin so easy, not greasy/oily feeling. I usually only use lotions with dark bronzers, so I was a little worried I wouldn&#x27;t get the color I was looking for. This lotion gets you tanner than you can ever imagine, and I can tell my skin is firming! This and white 2 black are the only lotions I will use now. It&#x27;s deff 5 starts!! My only tip is to not shower right after tanning, I wait about 8 hours so it can fully work its magic! I recomend this to anyone who asks! I even downgraded to the 48 bulb bed and there&#x27;s no difference between my tan in the high pressure.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but hate the residue this leaves on my skin. Very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> This was really runny and the aroma of it was really not pleasant  I definitely would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> YES! AS ALWAYS, YOU EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  Seems to be true to the salon lotion!</li>
    <li> I was shocked at the beautiful color I got from this lotion.... The price is so cheap but the product is not. I will not spend a hundred dollars on tanning bed lotion EVER AGAIN! Truly a quality product at an amazingly FAIR price</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my color since switching from a much cheaper lotion. The lotion smells great when you first put it on, but as it heats up, the scent becomes overpowering. By the time you’re done and dressed, it’s sickeningly strong.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lotion. Got a really awesome tan only going about 5 times. Without the orange effect. As for the cellulite reducer, I think it worked.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. Super light weight, not great at all, smells-really lightly-of lemon meringue and works GREAT.</li>
    <li> I just started tanning and this was a great starter lotion. I loved the way it smelled - it wasn&#x27;t overpowering and had a soft floral/perfume scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer so you don&#x27;t have to worry about streaks or orange marks between your fingers.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells really good and did not stink after tanning. I even went to the gym afterwards and still did not have a smell. I bought from Allure day spa and I don&#x27;t think it was a fake. I&#x27;ve used it once and am starting with no tan at all. So far very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I previously bought this at my local tanning salon and loved the scent and how soft it made my skin feel. I was very pleased to see it being sold on Amazon for a fraction of the price compared to the tanning salon! Easy on the bank account but I still get the same product! My skin is visibly softer, smoother, and appears &amp;#34;tighter.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is effective and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.  Amazon&#x27;s price is MUCH better than my tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It smells so good and when I am thru tanning I don&#x27;t smell like I just tanned (like you do with some of them).  I got dark very quickly with Blonde Obsession and it leaves my skin sooooo soft.  It is not a lotion with a bronzer in it, but that is what I like about it.  No bronzers and I am still have a dark tan!</li>
    <li> I simply love DC lotions. I used to be a Designer Skin brand gal but this is my 2nd lotion by DC and I love it. I have been tanning off and on for about 4 years and have tried a good chunk of well known lotions out there and this one is my new favorite. I really like these silicone lotions because it goes on smooth and you use less, and it melts into your skin so and turns it super soft. This one is a black lotus scented lotion and it honestly smells amazing, no after tan odor like Ed Hardy brands. It smells like this perfume I had from Charlotte Russe years ago, really sexy and sweet. This is a maximizer level 1 so it would be ideal for building upwards from your base tan or getting through a plateau. I tan twice a week usually sometimes 3 and this is perfect. It isn&#x27;t a bronzer so no orange or brown palms/streaks. It is a VERY high quality lotion that one should expect to pay triple the price. It really does make your legs look toned and firm. I suggest tanning with this and leaving it on for the rest of the day/night because its delightful scent lasts a LONG time. I would definitely repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I loooove this lotion! It is my absolute favorite! It smells amazing!! and leaves me feeling nice and silky! This lotion was $55 at my salon so the amazon price is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;The lotion was also unused and the real deal, which i was very happy about because I was worried it might be a fake.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell great color</li>
    <li> This was for  beginners. it was a level 1. I should read the labels before, the product, it self, smell good , went on nice, just wrong for me. Thank you</li>
    <li> After seeing all the positive reviews for this lotion, I decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using Designer Skin - Pumped - and I love it, but this helped me break through a plateau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very well - not greasy at all. It smells more like a perfume than a tanning lotion. The scent is strong at first, but diminishes after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to use artificial bronzers on my skin and this product did its job. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works good for tanning</li>
    <li> Not a super huge fan of the smell, but product works great. There are very few tanning lotions that aren&#x27;t bronzing or tingle factor lotions. This is a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a pretty basic level 1 lotion.</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  I have used it for almost a year now (more than one bottle).  Works and smells good.  I have had people ask me what I am wearing after using it because they tell me it smells good.  It is a white lotion which I prefer.</li>
    <li> Shipped FAST!  Smells great and works really good.  I have a great color.</li>
    <li> I started pretty pale. This stuff smells great, feels great and my tan is a warm brown. I love it.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with this lotion</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion !!!</li>
    <li> So, I have been using DC&#x27;s Couture Sport (Men) and that has created a great base tan.  I bought a package of Blonde Obsession from my salon the other day and made it last 2 sessions. I can already tell that I am pressing through my plateau, so I am snagging a bottle NOW! It is about $40 more at my salon (after my membership discount) so this is a GREAT deal!</li>
    <li> Product was easy to use. Love the shape of the bottle and the small opening so too much doesnt come out. Smells great, works great!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent that doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a tanning bed after using! Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I used a packet at my local salon and loved it and the color I got from it. They want $55 for the bottle and that was with 30% off! I decided to check here hoping not to get a bad product like some people have gotten online with Amazon providers. I got mine through Alure Day Spa fulfilled by Amazon, and they guarantee 100% authentic products. The bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed like I hoped for but it does look and smell exactly like the packet I used in the salon. Can&#x27;t wait to use it and if I get the same results I will be buying another bottle asap!!!</li>
    <li> smells great - works well</li>
    <li> I am so glad I trusted  the reviews. I have been tanning for awhile and just love this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have only used the lotion once, but it smells very good before and after tanning</li>
    <li> I borrowed my friend&#x27;s bottle of this when I left my Couture Sport at work. I&#x27;m not an avid tanner nor am I pro (I&#x27;m a novice ginger) but even I know a good product when I try one! This is a very light lotion that goes on easy, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave you oily/greasy. The fragrance is light when you put it on but when you&#x27;re in the bed, it can seem overpowering but that goes away after about 5 mins out of the bed. There is no ATO, so I can go straight to working after tanning. I loved it, so I bought my own bottle!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the scent, kinda granny perfume.  Didn&#x27;t get me dark either.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, it is a level one tanner so you aren&#x27;t going to get insanely dark in a short period of time. very great for those who like to have a base tan.</li>
    <li> Smells great but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. No tightening or color difference after using it awhile. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing like perfume, gives you a tan even on your legs! It goes on real well as well. And I have noticed my stretch marks fading away :-D</li>
    <li> 1) nice NATURAL tanning results..no fakey jersey shore color.&lt;br /&gt;2) some skin smoothing / toning benefits&lt;br /&gt;3) very pleasant smell and non greasy</li>
    <li> Love love intensifiers especially this one. It will get you hot</li>
    <li> Very sweet strawberry smell. Had to throw it away after 1 use because I was almost sick by the time i got home from the tanning bed had to shower asap.</li>
    <li> Smells great, not overpowering so you won&#x27;t smell it on you all night. Very absorbent, not watery or runny at all. Doesn&#x27;t make you feel slippery on the tanning bed and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. I like how it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of different bronzers in it. My tan comes out even and natural looking, not an orange or deep glowing brown (not in a good way) a couple hours after the tan session. You don&#x27;t have to be blonde to use it (ha). Great indoor tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Great lotion!!!! Gives great color and fast!! Love it! Would recommend this lotion to everyone!  Smells nice; not overpowering at all!</li>
    <li> Left the tanning salon feeling like my skin was smooth and silky. As far as fighting cellulite and all that, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any difference in my skin, other than an awesome tan!</li>
    <li> I loved it it works you&#x27;re skin is so smooth and it improved my skin texture</li>
    <li> Love the smell after tanning, even my husband has complimented it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It makes my skin soft, tan quickly, and smells wonderful!! I can already see a difference in my skin and I&#x27;ve only used it three times!</li>
    <li> I began using this about a week after I had started tanning.  Within the next week I was extremely dark.  And I have continued to darken and my skin has stayed soft.  And it smells pretty good and you don&#x27;t have that weird tanning bed smell.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this. A friend bought the same thing from a salon &amp; paid $50. This is a awesome product with an awesome price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!!!!  A fab buy!!</li>
    <li> Leaves a bad ATO. And for some reason the lotion started to make little flakes, and was falling off my skin just from my house to the tanning salon. It does make your skin very soft, and this is the only lotion I can use on my face without it breaking out.</li>
    <li> WORKS GOOD BUT I DON&#x27;T CARE FOR THE SCENT.</li>
    <li> Very good plateau buster for regular tanners. Prevents redness and makes skin feel soft and firm after regular use in tanning booths.</li>
    <li> Smells very strong before tanning, almost like fruity pebbles. Once I finished tanning the smell subsided dramatically . Apply this right before you tan if you are sensitive to smells. Keeps my skin way hydrated, better than others. I even use on my face and no breakouts!</li>
    <li> This is NOT authentic blonde obsession! When the product came in the mail it was not the same as the blonde obsession I had bought at the tanning salon. First of all the serial number was different, the real lotion from devoted creations had a longer serial number and was made from different plastic. Second of all, the texture, color, and smell of this product was also very different than the authentic one I purchased at the salon. When I used this lotion tanning I was very displeased. It made my skin feel like it was burning and I turned very red despite the fact that I didn&#x27;t move up in minutes. Don&#x27;t buy this lotion it is not from devoted creations and I am very mad I wasted my money!</li>
    <li> The lotion I purchased from Authentic Glamour was a fake. The plastic bottle, consistency, and smell are totally different than the real Blonde Obsession. My skin immediately started to tingle and turn red once applied. This lotion was white, thick and smelled like soap, nothing at all like the packets I use at my salon.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and helped me break my tanning plateau</li>
    <li> I really like this tanning lotion. It&#x27;s not too thick and I don&#x27;t feel like it clogs my pores. Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than a tanning salon. Smell was pleasant and the bottle is big. I would reccommend it. Doesn&#x27;t make you orange.</li>
    <li> Smells goodand it gives you good color. Wish the color lasted longer but overall good. I Wil see how I look after I finish the bottle</li>
    <li> Product shipped reasonably fast. It has a great smell, and seems to worknpretty well. Gives you s great tan and as for the toning and dkin tightening it seems to be working im seeing a decent different !</li>
    <li> So far I really like this lotion. I first started using this just on my legs because of the cellulite fighting, but I noticed such a difference between the color I was getting with this lotion compared to the lotion I was using on my upper body that I have now started using this for full body. The color is darker and it makes my skin feel and look super soft. I actually do notice a difference in cellulite..my skin looks a little tighter and smooth. Will definitely buy again! The smell is a little strong, but after like 30 mins from getting out of the bed it goes away.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected, it smells good and works like any maximizer out too.  I tan easily though, so I suppose others might have different experiences.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a lotion with some tingle but this has none. It smells nice and it moisturizes my ski but I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s done anything to improve or maintain my tan.</li>
    <li> Horrible after tan smell and hard to get the smell to go away even after through washing. Never buy again</li>
    <li> Really nice smelling &amp; my skin feels really smooth and firm when I&#x27;m done in the sun...</li>
    <li> I was drawn to this lotion because all it talked about was skin firming and things like that.  I have cellulite a lot in the back of my legs and butt area and I wanted to try this and tan, so I get a nice tan and my cellulite fades.  Well, ive tried it once, and it works!  One thing though is it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, it smells clean but when it goes on there is nothing really to smell.  I just love the bottle too.  Plus, since I am blonde now it really caught my attention. very cute.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Received product very quickly.</li>
    <li> Got my lotion very quickly! Smells great and gives great color!</li>
