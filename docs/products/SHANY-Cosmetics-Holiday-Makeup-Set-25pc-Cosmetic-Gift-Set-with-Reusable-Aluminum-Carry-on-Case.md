      <li>the texture &amp; quality of the products are amazing!!!</li>
      <li>Got this as a gift for my mom, and she absolutely loved it!</li>
      <li>When I opened it, all of the makeup looked beautiful, however, the box fell apart as soon as I opened the side drawer.</li>
      <li>Also the case is great; but it does not give you room to add any makeup that you may already have.</li>
      <li>There is a great selection of shadows and brushes, etc.</li>
      <li>So I am soo happy lots of makeup and great  colorfull makeup</li>
      <li>Very nice silver make-up case.</li>
      <li>But for a kids gift, it is most awesome and impressive, good for hours of fun and laughter.  </li>
      <li>It is a perfect item to take as you travel, because it fits so much inside it &amp; all closes up to a beautiful case.</li>
      <li>Great item :)</li>
      <li>A+ very satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>(also keeps toddlers out of the precious kit...!)</li>
      <li>It was great for my granddaughter&#x27;s first makeup kit.</li>
      <li>Very good, I&#x27;m happy because it was the birthday of my daughter but would recommend that the drawers of the case were a little stronger and better.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, and more.  </li>
      <li>She pulls it out when there&#x27;s sleepovers, and the girls do enjoy all this has to offer, from face to nails!</li>
      <li>Cute idea, but didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>I love this makeup kit.</li>
      <li>I want it please I need it for play practice in May 1 2 3 when will it come more of them</li>

      <li>You even need a steel wool pad to clean it off whatever surface you might find it on.</li>
      <li>Wife loved this and can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the cosmetics included...</li>
      <li>It has to be the best purchase - everything is in the one place, she also has things loosely stored in an open basket, and our puppy decided to chew up some things, but he cant get into the case!</li>
      <li>This make up case is really compact and cool.</li>
      <li>This makeup kit is exactly what I thought I would get after looking at the picture.  </li>
      <li>and this is my first box, but</li>

    <li> Got this as a gift for my mom, and she absolutely loved it! She wanted to practice her makeup skills and this had everything she needed.</li>
    <li> Returned mine, drawers didn&#x27;t shut.  Cute idea, but didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I like this product. However one of the nails did come out the second day. Also the case is great; but it does not give you room to add any makeup that you may already have.</li>
    <li> Was broken wen I got it and the makeup stinks don&#x27;t buy this product what ever you do. Remember BROKEN!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This box appears to be sturdy but quite the contrary. When I opened it, all of the makeup looked beautiful, however, the box fell apart as soon as I opened the side drawer. I wasn&#x27;t even able to open the other side drawer. Sent it back immediately.</li>
    <li> Wife loved this and can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of the cosmetics included... A+ very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup kit. I am in my 30&#x27;s and this is my first box, but second makeup kit. I just wish it was either deeper for storage, and more advanced with the shelves, but I&#x27;m not hating I love it, it works fine for me and considering buying one for my 14 year who is going on 15 this year 2014.</li>
    <li> So I am soo happy lots of makeup and great  colorfull makeup</li>

Not great quality at all (had to return one for missing drawer, and the second also had the drawer which was defective, and other poor packaging damage).  But for a kids gift, it is most awesome and impressive, good for hours of fun and laughter.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My 12 yr old wanted this for Christmas, so we indulged her. She pulls it out when there&#x27;s sleepovers, and the girls do enjoy all this has to offer, from face to nails! By the end of the night they are washing it off. It has to be the best purchase - everything is in the one place, she also has things loosely stored in an open basket, and our puppy decided to chew up some things, but he cant get into the case! (also keeps toddlers out of the precious kit...!) This was a great buy - i recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very nice silver make-up case. My teen daughter felt like a professional makeup artist, walking through the airport with this stylish case. It was the perfect Christmas gift. Thank you!</li>
