<li> They said it was to thick and to firm too.&lt;br</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve tried everything: the nasal strips (didn&#x27;t do anything and lefta sticky residue on pillows), the wedge pillow (he&#x27;d just slide down to an even worse position), and jaw strap (he wouldn&#x27;t even try it, so no data on that).</li>

<li> I bought this pillow because I was having horrible neck and upper back pain.</li>
<li> my occipital nerve issues have decreased when I wake now.</li>
<li> Lying down on it was very uncomfortable.</li>
<li> but they were too uncomfortable as well.</li>
<li> Seeing a Chiropractor and massage therapist is helping, but then every night I toss and turn and wake up with the worst stiff achy neck ever.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

    <li> I love this AWESOME pillow that clearly corrected my neck pain. I have since then purchased 2 additional pillows for my daughter, and a friend.</li>
    <li> this pillow hurts my neck and shoulder.  they will not take it back once you open it.</li>
    <li> my occipital nerve issues have decreased when I wake now. pillow has done good :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Seems to be helping me to wake up and having less pain in my neck! Only had it for about a month now.</li>
    <li> Has taken my husband a while to get used to it, but it&#x27;s suprisingly comfortable. For me – I&#x27;m just happy he&#x27;s breathing! Still snores like an elephant, but at least he&#x27;s breathing in and out. We&#x27;ve tried everything: the nasal strips (didn&#x27;t do anything and lefta sticky residue on pillows), the wedge pillow (he&#x27;d just slide down to an even worse position), and jaw strap (he wouldn&#x27;t even try it, so no data on that). And getting him to a sleep study or to go to a doctor? Not happening...</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting used to, but I do like it better than my standard pillow. I just have to fight my cat for it! She loves it.</li>
    <li> This pillow took a while to get use to. At first it was not comfortable. I used it for about a hour for the first three nights,after that I could use it all night.</li>
    <li> Best Pillow I have ever had. Alittle strange to get use to at first, but I don&#x27;t wake up with a sore neck anylonger.</li>
    <li> Finally! A good nights sleep without waking with a stiff neck. This pillow is just what I was looking for - I like it so much that I shared the info with my physical therapist.</li>
    <li> I bought this pillow because I was having horrible neck and upper back pain. I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep or get comfortable. As soon as I got my pillow I layed on it and ended up taking a long nap! It cradled my neck and head perfectly. I am so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> A bit stiff, and too high to comfortably rest the neck for long periods of time. More comfortable for side-sleeping, ironically.</li>
    <li> It was what I wanted, however, the filler is quite hard, which doesn&#x27;t feel so good at the base of the neck. Good thing I got the &amp;#34;gentle fill&amp;#34; cause the original would feel like sleeping on a rock! Not happy with it, but it will suffice until I can figure out how to make my own.</li>
    <li> It does take some time to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I get much better sleep with this nice pillow. Fits my head just right.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this pillow, I can not tell you the amount of pain I have been having in my neck and spine. Seeing a Chiropractor and massage therapist is helping, but then every night I toss and turn and wake up with the worst stiff achy neck ever.&lt;br /&gt;This pillow delivered to my house on Saturday, I slept 2 nights with it so far, Saturday and Sunday, I am so impressed its amazing,&lt;br /&gt;my neck ache I wake up with everyday went from a 10 to a 4 in pain, and I slept all night both nights, WHAT!!&lt;br /&gt;This pillow is only going to help my recovery now, I am so happy!&lt;br /&gt;If you have neck pain ect and your considering this pillow, take my word for it, its awesome! I would not be writing this review if I thought was just an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; pillow.</li>
    <li> I really love this pillow, I have been try over 20 different pillows, all kinds of material and shape, so far, this one suit me best.</li>
    <li> Way too large for me,a woman.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s too thick and firm for me. Lying down on it was very uncomfortable. Couldn&#x27;t take it for 5 mins. It&#x27;s now under my bed.&lt;br /&gt;I think it would work fine if it had 1/2 as much fill and/or could crush a little. My kids had the same experience. it made their necks hurt as I tried to give it to one of them but they were too uncomfortable as well. They said it was to thick and to firm too.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be well made, I&#x27;ve no criticism of the construction.</li>
    <li> I like the pillow and find it works well. I don&#x27;t know if there is anything better, but this works out for me</li>
