      <li>I was pleased with the ease of use, it wasn&#x27;t fragrant, and it went well with my highlighting cap, but it always turned my hair  from a white blonde to an orange within a day or two after doing it.</li>
      <li>but I love the fact that it didn&#x27;t seem to damage my already damaged fragile hair any further.</li>
      <li>The resulting color was actually too light for me, resulting in a bleached out look and far to yellow for my taste.</li>
      <li>ok for root touch-up for my dark blonde roots, but it also turned the already blond highlights orange.</li>
      <li>#99 Natural Palest Blonde&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;</li>
      <li>This gives me the soft platinum color that I like.</li>
      <li>I am going to try a diff natural brand to see if it works for me.</li>
      <li>Since I use such a light color, sometimes other products turn my hair blue.</li>
      <li>Does not dry out hair.</li>
      <li>I achieved platinum in a few streaks, where I had previously dyed hair, but the rest is more of a straw-colored yellow.</li>

    <li> I use both this one and the light copper blond one mixed equally. I get so many complements on my hair and everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair color! Also, the no chemicals aspect is very nice!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. Leaves my hair soft and healthy looking. Will continue to purchase. covers gray hair well</li>
    <li> Great product.I have tried many haircolors over the years and this one is so far the most gentle and gives good coverage. It was nice to see I could purchase from Amazon and not have to run from store to store to find.  Thanks for posting this item on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff out there and believe me Ive tried them all. This gives me the soft platinum color that I like. If I am gonna be blonde I want to be all the way blonde and not the brassy blonde. And my hair is short so I get 4 applications out of just one package. The difference is I use a 40 volume developer because my hair is so dark the other stuff wont lighten it I also add some powder bleach to the mix.. My secrets out. Im not a natural blonde. But hey if God intended for us to stay the way we were born they would not have invented hair color. If you have really dark hair and want to go blonde try this with my mode of using it and you will be amazed at the results. I also use a gentle scalp developer.</li>
    <li> Herbatint permanent hair color is wonderful!  Since I use such a light color, sometimes other products turn my hair blue. This one absolutely does not! That&#x27;s why I love it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty color and easy to use because it doesn&#x27;t drip if you&#x27;re careful... I have used Herbatint Permanent Herbal Haircolur (several different shades) for years and have never been disappointed. I now blend two different shades together to get the color I prefer.. I mix half a bottle of each and still get two colorings out of two boxes that way.</li>
    <li> After 20 years of dying my hair (w reg. hair dye) monthly, I switched to something less toxic for my hair. I have black hair, so I know I wouldn&#x27;t be blonde, but I was hoping to get a diff. color.  It is dark brown now -not even honey like color. It covered 40% of my gray hairs (I only have few). After I used the product, my hair was SOOOOOO dry and w/o shine. I have to use oil now for my hair to look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand anymore. I am going to try a diff natural brand to see if it works for me.</li>
    <li> A great product I will buy this dye again</li>
    <li> great product I will buy it again</li>
    <li> my hair looks lovely wont dry hair will buy more</li>
    <li> Gentle Great Product for Natural(not dyed) Med-Light Brown Hair. (Instead of using bleach)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1:&lt;br /&gt;Mix: 10N Platinum Blonde and 7C Ash Blonde(to make sure it is not too brassy)&lt;br /&gt;It lightens my med-light brown hair to a very light reddish golden blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2:&lt;br /&gt;Then i colour it a 2nd time(wait a day), to achieve a blonder colour. (mix 10N platinum Blonde with 7C Ash Blonde if its too brassy) OR I mix 10N Platinum Blonde with 10C Swedish Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 10C Swedish Blonde is a very light Ash Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;Another Step 2 Option:&lt;br /&gt;I colour (a 2nd time) with:&lt;br /&gt;Nice&#x27;n easy #102 Natural Light Ash Blonde&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;Nice&#x27;n easy #99 Natural Palest Blonde&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;Nice&#x27;n easy #87 Ultra Light Natural Blonde&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great way to get from natural(not dyed) med-light brown hair to blonde without bleach.</li>
    <li> not as good as others ive used</li>
    <li> My fave hair dye. Does not dry out hair. I use one box for three root touch ups.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for years.  safe, covers gray, my hair is soft and silky.  best on the market, have used other products. thanks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dye because it is not tested on animals. I am naturally dark blonde and wanted to go to platinum. I achieved platinum in a few streaks, where I had previously dyed hair, but the rest is more of a straw-colored yellow. Perhaps next time I will try leaving the treatment on a little longer. On the whole, I&#x27;m happy with the product and will try it again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this as a highlighter, since my usual home kit started scenting their product. I was pleased with the ease of use, it wasn&#x27;t fragrant, and it went well with my highlighting cap, but it always turned my hair  from a white blonde to an orange within a day or two after doing it. iIs ok for root touch-up for my dark blonde roots, but it also turned the already blond highlights orange. Not happy</li>
    <li> The color in ad and color on box was not what I got. I got a gold blonde not platinum blonde which is what I wanted. The smell was great and my hair felt good.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally a dark dirty blonde color. I had lightened it with herbatint&#x27;s chamomile hair lightener and it was several different shades of blonde. I decided to try this to even out the color. The resulting color was actually too light for me, resulting in a bleached out look and far to yellow for my taste. I plan to darken ASAP but I love the fact that it didn&#x27;t seem to damage my already damaged fragile hair any further. My hair is super fine and I have a medical condition that caused tons of hair damage and this stuff did not make it worse at all. I am sure the results would be different for everyone so it might be just the right color for you depending on your current color.</li>
    <li> I will not use this again because I was very blond at the beginning and after I used this I got yellow brassy tone and I dont like it at al!! I will go back to tint of nature because it gives me plantinum hair!</li>
