<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Regarding the product, I love it. I have sensitive teeth and I find toothpastes like Sensodyne to be unpleasant and cause a lingering bitter taste in my mouth. Colgate and Aquafresh sensitive do not, so I use both brands. They never cause tooth pain either, so they both work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in grocery stores and drugstores, this usually costs close to $4, and \\&quot;sales\\&quot; (I&#x27;ve never seen this less than $3.59) are much rarer for sensitive toothpastes than they are for regular pastes, so it&#x27;s never been the cheapest way to brush your teeth. But at today&#x27;s price of $13.90, it works out to $2.32 per tube, which is . . . well, cheap. The savings won&#x27;t make or break you financially, but it&#x27;s always nice to know you&#x27;re getting a real bargain. I don&#x27;t mind buying 6 at a time and storing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and very happy to see it here for this price, the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever seen it anywhere. 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALERT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just popped by this page (Sept 10, 2009) and was SHOCKED to see a new seller \\&quot;SET 4 BABY,\\&quot; selling this 6-pack for over $35!!! Seriously? Almost $6 per tube PLUS shipping??? As you can see from my June 29 review, I paid less than $14. To me, anything over $21 is not worth it. But $35? It&#x27;s laughable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sept 11, 2009:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the \\&quot;set4baby\\&quot; merchant and they were kind enough to respond, but indicated they were unable (unwilling) to lower the price from $35, but I see now it&#x27;s back to being sold by Amazon, which is a good thing. They must have decided not to sell this product anymore. Any future purchasers of this product should just keep an eye on the ever-fluctuating price. I think if you can get it for under $18 for this 6-pack ($3.00 per tube), it&#x27;s a very good deal. Maybe I&#x27;d even buy for up to $21 ($3.50 each). Otherwise, it&#x27;s not worth saving a few pennies from the grocery/drug store prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 31, 2010:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased to see this is still being sold &amp; fulfilled by Amazon, and is going for under $15, so it appears to be stable.

    <li> At this Price how can you go wrong. The Tubes were the large size. Very Happy</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; toothpaste for my tooth pain. I couldn&#x27;t see how that would help much but my husband picked up some Colgate and it worked. It isn&#x27;t available at every place I shop, especially at a decent price so I was pleased to find it here and have it delivered to my home. I keep some in each bathroom and never run out anymore. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had lifelong heart problems. The medications for my heart and asthma, and constant hospital stays with no toothbrush completely destroyed my teeth. I have very crooked teeth and the medications made my gums and teethextremly sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot see a dentist as they continue to refuse to work on me. I am told I need a root canal, but, I cannot find a dentist that is willing to work only teeth. The dentists say I am too big of a risk with a serious heart problem. Now as a young man of twenty one yeRs of age, I want a life and horrible teeth makes others perceptions od me as having bad hygene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sW this toothpaste in a grocery store and I picked it up. Within days my teeth no longer ached. I threw out my old tube of paste and completely switched to this one. The stains on my teeth are slowly disappearing, and my teeth looks better, much, much better then they did six months ago when I first started using this paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It basically cleared up my sensitivity, and is slowly whitening my teeth. Soon all I will need to do is to find a damn dentist that will give me braces to strengthen my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Colgate for an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I usually use Sensodyne because my teeth are sensitive to hot and cold. This doesn&#x27;t relieve the sensitivity in my experience. I tried it because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper, and almost half way through the tube I am noticing my teeth are sensitive again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I used it and my sensitivity went down to nothing. I am truly happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I suffer from sensitive teeth, have for sometime now.  I can&#x27;t even drink or eat anything cold with it being bothersome.  Luckily, I ran across this toothpaste and gave it a try -- it is certainly effective on my teeth!  I can now eat it some of my favorite foods without feeling having to flinch.  This tootpaste will now be staple, highly recommended to all possible buyers.</li>
    <li> Within a week, my teeth were already less sensitive.</li>
    <li> I got my Colgate Sensitive locally. It is my first sensitivity reducing toothpaste and it has been a success! In less than a week my teeth are less sensitive to temperature. I can finally eat ice cream again without worry about it touching the sensitive part of my molars near the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve aged, like many others I know, my gums have receded some to expose bits of more sensitive tooth surface. I guess it&#x27;s just part of my inevitable encroachment to decrepitude... Colgate Sensitive Whitening has helped stave off the associated tooth sensitivity and I&#x27;m very grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it will whiten as well as [[ASIN:B00ISOSRDW Colgate Optic White Icy Fresh]] did for me. It&#x27;s not been long enough to tell yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use Colgate Sensitive has a taste that is minty-nice but over sweet to me. It does not over-foam either; a problem with some other toothpastes in the past. I&#x27;ll probably get used to the sweetness eventually so no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it directly and effectively addresses my tooth sensitivity I&#x27;m giving Colgate Sensitive 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone!</li>
    <li> I usually use Sensodyne for my sensitive teeth, but thought I would try this because it was cheaper.  After using it for several weeks, my sensitivity started to come back, so I had to switch back to Sensodyne.  I seem to do okay if I alternate between the Colgate and Sensodyne, but Colgate alone does not take care of my sensitivity.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste.  I was lucky to have found it in &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste and this is a very good deal to buy it in bulk.  It is cheaper than buying them individually at a retail store.  I think the toothpaste does a good job and I have no issues with it at all.</li>
    <li> Good deal for 6 pack. I only use sensitive toothpaste &amp; this is the best.</li>
    <li> I began using this product several years ago as I began to have some sensitivity on several of my upper teeth (toward the back). When I first using this product, I thought it would be a miracle worker and completely take away the sensitivity on the two teeth I have been having trouble with. Unfortunately, it has not been a miracle worker for me. I continue to have sensitivity in those two same teeth and it appears to have gotten worse over the past several years. I brush my teeth twice daily, have good hygiene and have never had a cavity in my life. I guess this toothpaste just does not work with my kind of sensitivity. However, I continue to buy this toothpaste as I feel that it can (hopefully) help with future sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price&lt;br /&gt;2. Taste&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Didn&#x27;t address my sensitivity at all</li>
    <li> I have very, very sensitive teeth and have always used sensodyne in the past but I never really liked the taste of it. My dentists office recommended this instead and now I am hooked!!&lt;br /&gt;It tastes great, has whitened my teeth and it keeps the pain away.....YAYYYY!!</li>
    <li> feels good and wither!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and gum recession, this toothpaste is great for helping to build the confidence in brushing teeth without hurting. my oral surgeon reccomended this toothpaste to me and i have loved it ever since, will purchase from this sell again when i need more</li>
    <li> I keep ordering this tooth paste from Amazon:  1. The price is much better than buying a tube at a time at a retail store.  2.  It works for sensitive teeth.  3.  It isn&#x27;t a strong burning toothpaste.  4.  Using it twice a day, at least, it protects my teeth as I don&#x27;t have cavities at my 6 month checkup.  I hope Amazon keeps offering this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> A few years ago I visited my sister across country for a couple of weeks and used her standard-brand toothpaste. By the end of the visit, my teeth were sensitive to cold again.&lt;br /&gt;Same thing with this toothpaste -- tried it for a couple of weeks and became sensitive to cold drinks again. It was worth a shot, though, because this one was about half the price, and the taste is pleasant, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004AI968U Sensodyne Full Protection Plus Whitening Toothpaste + 4 oz]]:&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients - Potassium nitrate 5%; Sodium fluoride 0.15% w/v fluoride ion.&lt;br /&gt;Inactive ingredients - water, hydrated silica, sorbitol, glycerin, pentasodium triphosphate, PEG-8, flavor, titanium dioxide, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, xanthan gum, sodium hydroxide, sodium saccharin, sucralose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001H9NCV2 Colgate Sensitive Maximum Strength Sensitive Whitening Toothpaste 6 oz (Pack of 6)]]:&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients - Potassium nitrate 5%; Sodium fluoride 0.24% w/v fluoride ion.&lt;br /&gt;Inactive ingredients - water, glycerin, hydrated silica, sorbitol, PEG-12, sodium lauryl sulfate, flavor, poloxamer 407, xanthan gum, cellulose gum, sodium saccharin, sodium hydroxide, titanium dioxide, FD&amp;C blue no. 1,</li>
    <li> arrived quickly would order again. exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This works very well for my sensitivity and is reasonably priced. I&#x27;ve gone through several tubes, it&#x27;s effective and that&#x27;s why I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I will buy more.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by television advertisements concerning the &amp;#34;Sensitine&amp;#34; brand.  I was told by my Dental Hygienist that this Colgate &amp;#34;With Sensitive&amp;#34; is the exact same thing as the much higher priced Sensitine Brand.</li>
    <li> Nice. large and excellent, helps me in my tooth sensitivity problems. very responsible in delivering.</li>
    <li> great for sensitive teeth</li>
