<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> you&#x27;ll have to be careful fitting your entire hand in all at once but it can be done, a friend of mine with bigger hands can get her hand in too, just have to be careful, it works like a charm and faster than the UV lights, it&#x27;s super lightweight and small so really portable!  I love it.</li>
    <li> Sometimes the buttons give me problems. I have to keep pushing to adjust the time. But ive had this for about 5 month and I really like it. My first light was a little more money and it took triple the time. I got it at sally&#x27;s.  They over charge for everything. So I got this led off amazon to cut down on time verses my old Uv. For the price its worth it. Even if I have to replace in a year. But its a small problem and I don&#x27;t think I will. Otherwise I would have given five stars.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t have the power to dry my nails  in under ten minutes buts its ok.  I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but have a couple complaints.. Cord is to short and sometimes thumbs don&#x27;t cure all the way.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present&amp; was so tempted to keep it for myself. It has more room than I expected&amp; cures so fast</li>
    <li> I just received and the opening is quite small compared to my UV Lamp.  I have small hands (ring size 5-6) and I feel like I have to group my fingers together to get them into the opening safely.  I plan to try it in the next two weeks and then I&#x27;ll decide whether to keep or not.  The price is good and it was delivered early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  10/12/13 (went from 4 stars to 3) one for small opening and one for short cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it but now that I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;d like to offer a few more comments.  I do feel cramped with the very small opening and don&#x27;t feel as though I can lay my fingers flat.  I feel the heat from the LEDs on my middle 3 fingers as I try to place my fingers totally in the opening (my fingers are long for my small hands, but normal and my nails are short at this time, usually they&#x27;re long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other concern is the very short cord, only 3 feet and I can barely use the Lamp because my plug is on the floor and my desk is normal height and it barely makes it.  Again, I&#x27;m feeling very cramped (inside with small opening and outside with short cord).  I&#x27;m trying to see if I can purchase another cord of longer length because that alone will keep me from using this lamp as much as my UV Lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to have a spare, it&#x27;s easy to use and I&#x27;ll be switching between my UV Lamp and my LED Lamp as I&#x27;m not sure end product is any different.  I never felt the heat like this with my UV Lamp.</li>
    <li> Actually, half way thru the drying it stops working and needs to be reset, as if it gets tired.  Get something else!</li>
    <li> The product worded very well. I would buy it again. I love the timer on it, helps keep track of the time.</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own nails for year. The title say 12 watts LED UV, This is a LED lamp and will not cure UV nail polish. A UV lamp will cure both types of nail polish, but not the other way around. P.S. I did try a LED nail polish in red, would not dry it completely. Through it did dry the clear coat just fine.</li>
    <li> My mother in law and i shared a gelish mini....i wanted my own....but not at $75!!!  this has more room for entire hand and even toes....has more lights too....not to mention comes in pink!!!  Great deal!!</li>
    <li> I can place my all of my nails in at the same time, works great! Easy to use, would recommend</li>
    <li> This was my first led nail lamp purchase.  I thought it worked fine, as expected, but now after only about 25 uses, the button to turn it on broke and I can hear something rattling around inside.  The company was no help, as I am apparently out of the warranty period.  I am buying a better brand this time around!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very cute LED light dryer. It fits my hand perfectly. I&#x27;m a nail technician and I usually only set 30s for curing time for each gel application at my work place, so I tried the same method with this LED light drier but it seems still a little tacky. So later, I decided to cure my fingers for 1 minute each application and it turned out perfectly. I just got it a couple days ago, so let see how the gel will last. I&#x27;ll update my feedback after 2 weeks. Last but not least, I used Gelish for my manicure.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well when I first purchased it but I hadn&#x27;t used it in awhile and, about a year later, the lights don&#x27;t seem to be as strong (I have to hold my nails under the lights longer than previously to get the polish to cure) and sometimes all of the lights don&#x27;t all illuminate.  If I had to purchase another LED light, I&#x27;d probably spend the money for a nicer one.</li>
    <li> It fits my entire hand perfectly and its small. I can easily store it anywhere and even travel with it.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I like the fact that you can use this with both LED nail polish and UV. The timer on it works great. I used this on my Gelish nail polish and my nail polish lasted two weeks. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Great lamp! I like that it has timing options (30, 60, 90 seconds)! The price was reasonable. My only issue was the tracking number was never updated so I couldn&#x27;t track my package.</li>
    <li> Light works as it&#x27;s supposed to.  I would have given it 5 stars, however I bought an LED light bc I read that it reduces curing time.  However I still did 2 min. each step so it didn&#x27;t save any time at all.  The nice thing is not having to replace bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought this light was broken.  I used it for the first time along with the Gelish Basix Kit I  and Gelish Polish that I bought at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My nails were not curing very well even when I tried 4 min under the light!  My nails smudged and didn&#x27;t look very good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second day, I tried again.  This time I placed my polishes in a warm bowl of water to thin them out.  It did help with the consistency.  If the polish is too thick it won&#x27;t cure as well.  The polish dried a little better but still not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my daughters nails, I used a different brand and color of polish and it worked perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this light, I did 2 min. each step.  The polish will remain slightly tacky between coats.  Don&#x27;t worry about this.  Don&#x27;t even touch them to see how dry  or hard they are. Just keep going through the steps.  After you put the Top coat on and cure it, you will take the cleanser with lent free pad and wipe off the tacky residue.  Nails will not smuge and they will look beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of this light compared to others, this was a good deal.  I only wish it cured faster.</li>
    <li> I debated among several UV curing lamps and finally settled on this one.  I love it. It dries very quickly, uses very little energy and is large enough for one full hand, but small enough that it is not cumbersome. I highly recommend it for at home gel manicures.</li>
    <li> I have been doing gel nails at home for several years now. Prior to purchasing this LED light, I had been using a U/V dryer. Although the U/V dryer was affordable and effective, after doing this for some time, I wanted to be able to do my nails faster, like when you get them done at the salon. I chose this product for its price and customer reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine is great and seals gel polishes in 30 seconds. My one concern was that it might be too small to fit a whole hand, but my hand (four fingers and thumb) fits neatly inside the light. There&#x27;s not a ton of room, so you have to be careful putting a hand with uncured polish in is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I am very satisfied as this product provides for a cheap and fast DIY gel mani experience</li>
    <li> I had one of the cheaper, small LED lights that came with the Red Carpet Gel Manicure set from Ulta.  This one is so much better for not much more money!!  It will do all 5 nails at once, so it cuts the setting time in half, instead of having to do thumbs separately.  Plus it has a 30/60/90 second timer.  Works well, great for the price.</li>
    <li> I liked the design and thought it was easy to use. The lights came on and it looked like it would work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that it didn&#x27;t dry my gel nails at all. I used Gelish brand which states that you can use an LED lamp. I tried putting the polish on really thin. I left my nails under the LED lights for 90 seconds with no change. I tried about 10 more sets of 90 seconds and the polish was still wet and tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this for a refund.</li>
    <li> I purchased sally hansen gel polish kit during this summer.&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, the led lamp came with the kit broke recently.&lt;br /&gt;so I have been looking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came on time. And, everything is packed really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I am pretty satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The timer is great.&lt;br /&gt;I am tiny so it&#x27;s not a problem to fit my whole hand and feet in.&lt;br /&gt;But, after several use,&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that if you don&#x27;t put your hand or feet in deep enough, the polish would not cure correctly.&lt;br /&gt;In other words, you HAVE TO put your hand or feet in all the way.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the short cord that many mentioned, it can be challenging at times to do your manicures or pedicures comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would suggest that you cure you thumb separately with this light.&lt;br /&gt;Just because how the light is designed, the heat is only concentrated at the center spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take me a couple use to get familiar with this light.&lt;br /&gt;I would say it takes some getting-used-to for perfect gel mani &amp; pedi with this light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I mainly use sally hansen gel polish and orly gel fx.&lt;br /&gt;I set my timer at 90s. It works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it is really easy to work on my nails at home.</li>
    <li> This is the best LED nail lamp I can find with this price. It works perfectly fine so I can&#x27;t think of any reason why anyone should get a more expensive lamp. I purchased a gel nail starter kit online from somewhere and the tiny LED lamp they included was basically a piece of junk. It couldn&#x27;t set my nail from the first time I use it. I was very frustrated with it so I decided to find something a lot more powerful. This works with all my gel polish so I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price!! I gave it an extra minute to set between coats.  Shipped quickly.  Received in timely matter.</li>
    <li> I BARELY USED THIS LAST WEEKEND.. I SHOULDVE TESTED T OUT WHEN I RECEIVED IT.. IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK GOOD.. I HAVE TO PRESS THE 90 SECOND BUTTON 4-5 TIMES FOR IT TO WORK OK.. IT STILL DOES CURE THE GEL POLISH WELL ENOUGH.. I BOUGHT THIS TO SAVE MONEY AND ITS A RIP OFF.. I MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK TO DOING IT AT THE SALON</li>
    <li> This is perfect for what I needed and it works great. The timer is an added bonus, now I don&#x27;t have to watch the clock.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this lamp and for the price, I thought I was geting a great deal. However, when I tried it for the first time, I used Gelish polish and it cured unevenly. I thought I might try to extend the time to get a more even cure, but even then I wouldn&#x27;t get a complete cure. I also tried my Finger Paints gel polish and OPI gel polish and still didn&#x27;t get a complete and even cure. I tried it again about a week later, and kept my nails in the lamp for two minutes. I still did not get an even cure and the unit started to heat up. Not enough to be bothersome, but it was definitely noticeable. Once the unit would heat up, the lamp would not turn on at all. I can only sum this up to the possibility of a faulty lamp. Sadly, it is being returned tomorrow morning and I continue my search for an led lamp.</li>
    <li> My husband tells me that the power cord is the reason that the lamp will not work.  I wanted to purchase a different power cord, but was told that a different power cord will not work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a dark pink, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem. I love this light, I needed an LED for my gel polish because when you do nails for a living time is money and I needed a light that cured them in 30 seconds instead of a UV light for 2 minutes. It has a timer on it so once it has been 30 seconds, 60 seconds or 90 seconds (depending on what you set it to) the light shuts off. I don&#x27;t think that it is actually 30 seconds though, sometimes it seems that it turns off much sooner than other times. But it is doing what it is supposed to. It&#x27;s light and it&#x27;s small which is nice since I have to pack it around everywhere. I am so happy with it, especially with the price</li>
    <li> I would rate it -10 if i could...!&lt;br /&gt;Got it in october 29th but as i was traveling i didnt have the chance to use it until today, december 30th.&lt;br /&gt;Was able to get 1 hand done only as the unit broke down -the charger exploted.</li>
    <li> The lamp arrived quickly.  It was VERY poorly packed in it&#x27;s original flimsy box that was not taped shut, then in a plastic mailing bag.  I would recommend that they put the lamp in a packing box for protection.  When I opened the box there was a loose nail floating around, and the lamp&#x27;s pink casing was broken open.  I have no idea where the nail came from, I was able to click the plastic pink casing back together.  The lamp appears to work, but I am wondering for how long.</li>
    <li> broke after 6 uses., company contacted me and are replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;works really well, dries nails fast. happy with product before the&lt;br /&gt;on/off stopped working. update..Got my replacement hassle free!&lt;br /&gt;will review new one in a few months.</li>
    <li> ---Updated: Dec 10, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;After seeing my review, the seller contacted me and issued a full refund for the product even though the refund period had passed.  It is obvious that they care about customer satisfaction!  Although my product appeared to stop working after a few times, my product may have been a lemon.  The seller states that each item is tested prior to shipment to ensure that it is functioning.  I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller in the future especially because they take full responsibility for the quality of the product and work hard to ensure customer satisfaction.  + 2 stars for customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Original Review: Dec 1, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;Used 3-4 times with no problems, but then it stopped curing polish.  Mine was sold by MelodySusie Direct, so I thought it would be no problem.  I am not certain if mine is authentic or not because I am not familiar with this brand.  I&#x27;ve seen several brands selling the same looking lamp on Amazon so I don&#x27;t really know if there is an \\&quot;authentic\\&quot; one or not.  The silver logo on mine is peeling off on the front of the lamp.  Another red flag would be that it says \\&quot;Professional Nail UV Lamp\\&quot; but is sold as an LED lamp and has the blue lights inside.  I&#x27;ve tried to use this lamp at least 7 times and it&#x27;s been very frustrating the past few times as my polish will not cure.  I&#x27;ve been careful to paint very thin layers.  I do my mom&#x27;s and her friend&#x27;s nails and they have had to stick their hand under the lights for over 4 minutes sometimes and still the polish is tacky.  When I wipe off the tackiness (I have the Gelish Basix Kit), the nails are no longer shiny.  This is very disappointing!  Not sure what is wrong!  I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of gel polish and none are curing correctly.</li>
    <li> The lamp came early and was packaged in a box with air packs. I opened it everything looked good no damage but when I picked it up it had something rattling inside so I plugged it up and all of the lights came on. I do recommend this lamp because the price was better than any other place I looked and it works with my gelish polish great! I just hope the rattling isn&#x27;t anything major but for now it works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this light as well as all of the essentials for the gelish system.  On my first attempt, I noticed that although I can squeeze all 5 fingers in, the light doesn&#x27;t cure my thumb or pinky on the sides very well.  It makes sense to me after the fact that the rest were perfectly cured, but the sides of the first and last didn&#x27;t get enough even lighting.  For this reason, I gave it four stars.  I spent just a bit more for this one so that I could do my whole hand at once, but it doesn&#x27;t really work out.  My hands are large, so if you have small hands, it might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I noticed was that the 30 second preset isn&#x27;t exactly 30 seconds... More like 25 seconds.  I used gelish gossip girl (hot pink)and it did a little better with 60 seconds.  Not a super big deal to me.  Maybe the 30 seconds will be fine for lighter colors.  All in all, pretty pleased with the purchase.  For those that say that it doesn&#x27;t cure, I would advise THIN coats!  I did a bit of research and that was the take away for sure!  I did as thin as I could get them and it was just fine.</li>
    <li> I only got to use this light once.  The second time a prong in the plug broke off into the outlet.  I am having it replaced and I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I took my dryer to South America in checked luggage and it came through the trip just fine.  My daughter liked it so much I bought another one for her.</li>
    <li> This product is a great value for the money and the free nippers are the best I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve been a nail tech for 17 years now. I was especially pleased that all 5 fingers on one hand can fit in the lamp at the same time not just 4 like many lamps. You definitely have a return customer here.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that is an LEV/UV lamp and it works great curing my gel nails.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Product is clearly advertised as Melody Susie gel lamp with bonus nail nipper.  Product arrived quickly. However, product was not as advertised.  Was a cheap knock-off, no-name product, and did not come with nail nipper.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> It works really well with my Gelish polish and cures the coats in only 30-60 seconds.  The only issue I have with it is that my nails have to rest flat under the light which doesn&#x27;t allow me to do my thumbs at the same time.  Also, even though it&#x27;s clearly an led lamp, I just noticed that it&#x27;s labeled uv.  I guess it must be a typo..  Really I can&#x27;t complain though, I have been doing my own gel nails for about a month though and they are coming out even better than at the salon!</li>
    <li> Works well.  I am a little bummed.  When I get my nails done at the salon, with the new LED dryer they last 3 weeks.  Mine only last 1 week with this dryer.  You have to be careful to make sure your thumbs are in the light.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price. Able to fit fingers and thumb, which makes whole process faster than with cheaper lamps. Did not come with the nail nippers, but I don&#x27;t care, that&#x27;s not why I bought this! Would totally recommend for someone with UV lamp looking to switch to LED.</li>
    <li> - Prompt shipping / Delivery&lt;br /&gt;- Product received matched description exactly &amp; was nicely packaged&lt;br /&gt;- Works well for the price&lt;br /&gt;- I can fit all 5 fingers into the machine!&lt;br /&gt;- have tried this w/ IBD, TruGel, &amp; Gelish- works for all 3!</li>
    <li> A great product for curing gel nails.  Compact and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Can only do one hand at a time.  Look forward to further uses.</li>
    <li> Received this nail lamp a few days ago, was a little worried because it came with absolutely no insert or instructions. It turned out to be simple to use though and works perfectly. I used the Gellish polish and it was cured under this light in 30 seconds. I was skepticle about buying this one because it was priced much lower than other LED lamps, but it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> It is very cute lamp.I love it! Working good. I can fit my whole five in it. The charger didn&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
    <li> The price it was attracted me and I was willing to take a chance despite no reviews. I&#x27;ve used it several times to do my nails and it works great. I&#x27;ve also loaned it to family and friends with no problems. The size is perfect and I like the timers. I&#x27;ll update in a few months.</li>
    <li> &#x3D;&#x3D;added 03/06/2014 Korea time2&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the machine again, and found a comment which is very small at the bottom of the lamp, it says, \\&quot;Ultraviolet radiation may cause injury to eyes and skin.....bla bla..\\&quot;,, does this mean this is UV LAMP ?  NOT LED LAMP ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product description says, it LED UV Lamp.. as far as I know LED lamp and UV lamp is different... can anyone explain to me ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;added 03/06/2014 Korea time&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m editing the feedback since I&#x27;m having trouble now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this LED lamp, I used OPI gel, light pink(princess rule), and this lamp worked OK with it at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I purchased another OPI gel, different colors, such as dark blue(Russian Navy), deep pink(My Address is Hollywood) etc, then this lamp doesn&#x27;t work.  I mean this lamp works OK for light pink including base and top, but doesn&#x27;t work for dark color gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure which one has problems, lamp or gel polish....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, fyi, and if there are anyone who may have some helpful comments, please add the comments here, it&#x27;ll be very helpful to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;first review I left&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is the only one I&#x27;ve used, I cannot compare with any other ones, but it works OK to me.  fyi, I used OPI gel colors.</li>
    <li> Just barely works.  It&#x27;s slower than my sally hansen drug store model. It did come with the nail nippers. You can fit all your fingers into it,  but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough light to cook them all and you still have to do thumbs separate.  It does look super cool though and if doesn&#x27;t feel rickety,  it just needs stronger lights.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp because I&#x27;m a nail tech and I do my mom&#x27;s nails. She loves gel nails but was concerned about the UV lamp I was using so I bought this one to put her mind at ease. It works great with the gel products I have and she&#x27;s happy to have that option of not putting her hand into a UV lamp. It&#x27;s a lot smaller than my UV lamp but it gets the job done. I don&#x27;t have any complaints so far as to it&#x27;s performance</li>
    <li> The design is great. The lights surround the nail. It is so much faster than the old UV lights. Cure in less than half the time. 30 seconds and a posed to 2 minutes. Ease of use gives this lamp both (beautifully manicured) thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I went on a quest to find the BEST LED lamp with the most wattage, for the price. I looked all over the internet, and I mean ALL OVER! I found higher watts in a LED lamp, but the price was nearly triple.I DONT THINK SO... This nail dryer is \\&quot;PERFECT\\&quot; to dry my gel nails. I cannot understand how anyone can pay $50.00 for a nail dryer with less watts, that you can only put FOUR fingers in at a time! The last time I checked, I had five fingers on each hand! Only drying four at a time doubles the amount of time you have to spend doing your nails.(you have to do thumbs seperately)If you have nothing but time on your hands then go for it, but for about $5.00 more SPLURGE for this one,you will thank me every time you do your nails.It&#x27;s very powerful, and seems to be a good quality. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Great price for a light that works on gelish, I usually double expose my nails just in case but it definitely works on Gelish</li>
    <li> This light is so small you cannot even fit 1 hand! Two days after purchasing it it broke, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m even upset because it was a piece of garbage!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as promised. I am able to fit my whole hand inside. No problems whatsoever. Really recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Gave it a 3stars as it takes quite some time as compared to stated 5 to 30 sec for gel to cure. Had to spend the same amt of time as per uv lamp. This is suppose to be led n faster</li>
    <li> It works perfect. I have used Gelish, OPI, Le Chat, Artistic and IBD gel polish and they all cure fine. I can fit my whole hand in there, I do not have super tiny hands nor do I have big hands.</li>
    <li> I used to use an at home UV light and I&#x27;d be curing my nails for almost 5-6 minutes a coat and in the end it still couldn&#x27;t be completely hard and would chip within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This light is fantastic! Greattt price and very satisfied. As long as you use the correct UV polish (they even have it at CVS) you&#x27;ll get great results. Base Coat &amp;#62; Polish &amp;#62; Top Coat (make sure to cap ends of nails). My manicures have been staying past 2 weeks! And cures soo fast. I do 90 seconds a coat. Sometimes I can fit all 5 fingers in but 4 and 1 is just easier than getting them all to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Very satisfied! I&#x27;ve done 3 different manicures and all have been great, machine still working as it should.</li>
    <li> I use the 60sec timer for base, and 90 seconds for all color, and 180 seconds for the final top coat. Rub with alcohol in the end... and I have NEVER witnessed any problems with this product. In addition, when I received this product my puppy pulled the cord and knocked it off my 2 foot table. IT DID NOT BREAK. haha. that was a good sign that this is a sturdy product, depsite it&#x27;s light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 8 uses later, the lights are loosing strength. I am needing to use the 90 second timer for all coats. It still works, the lights are just loosing the juice they once had.</li>
    <li> I ordered the MelodySusie Pro LED lamp and received an off brand cheap imitation.  Don&#x27;t purchase this item from Beauticom.  The lamp lights up but will not cure even the thinnest layer of nail gel and I&#x27;ve tried many different brands.  Item also did not include the nail nippers as stated in the listing.&lt;br /&gt;Junk.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This light is great if you are using it at home and not too often. It is not strong enough to do a 1 min cure. Better off getting the UV light if you have to wait 90 sec to cure and its still not cured all the way. UV is only 2 min cure time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed manicurist/esthetician and owner of a nail salon. I just want to try out  this lamp, and hopeful to refer the lamp, if works efficiently, to others at the salon. My salon uses Harmony Gelish, OPI, and Shellac. I only have the lamp for two weeks. The first week was great. Each coat cures in 30 seconds no problem. The whole last week was a different story, the base coat and the top coat cured good between 60-90 seconds. When apply the color coat, doesn&#x27;t matter if Gelish, OPI, or Shellac, even if I left the 30min button on, the polish still ran. I resorted to using my old UV gel lamp instead. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> ***BEWARE WRONG ITEM SENT***&lt;br /&gt;Do Not Order From This seller Beware**&lt;br /&gt;1. ORDERED a Melody Susie led uv gel lamp recieved a NO NAME CHEAP PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;2. NOT THE PRODUCT IN THE PICTURE.&lt;br /&gt;3.SO CHEAP iT DOES NOT TURN ON AND OFF&lt;br /&gt;4. SECOND ON TOPS  DONT CHANGE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOOKS USED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I THOUGHT I WOULD BE RECEIVING THE ONE IN THE PICTURE AS They USED.  No did not recieve the item they advertise..&lt;br /&gt;AWFUL Seller!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this light to cure my Gelish polish and it works fantastically! I have been shopping around for a reasonably priced LED light to use with Gelish and they are all very expensive. I wanted an LED light system vs. a UV light system because I have read countless review about the UV systems needing frequent light bulb replacement (which add up after a while). LED systems do not require light bulb replacements. This unit was more than 50% cheaper than the other LED lights available, so I thought I would give it a shot. I am so glad I did! It cures the polish very quickly. It has 30/60/90 second intervals to cure the polish. The opening is quite big as I can fit my entire hand (including thumb) or foot comfortably into the dryer. It also feels very sturdy despite the cheap price. The only downside is the rather short cord. Also, my unit did not come with the adapter as advertised on here, but I don&#x27;t need an adapter. Overall a fantastic buy! I highly recommend this dryer for gel polishes!</li>
    <li> Have used this product twice so far and completely love it. My entire hand/foot fits in it and I can cure each layer of polish in thirty seconds. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ordered the MelodySusie LED nail dryer with nail nippers for my wife.  This is NOT what I got! I didn&#x27;t even receive the nail nippers.&lt;br /&gt;I received an obvious counterfeit that has no brand markings whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Even the english grammar is incorrect and actually funny (I.e. \\&quot;the use of low cost\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;my wife has used it and it takes longer than is advertised, but does work.</li>
    <li> I love the timer and it&#x27;s comfortable to use.  I can fit all 4 fingers and my thumb inside and when following the Gelish instructions it does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is a bit short, so if your outlet isn&#x27;t close you may need an extension cord.</li>
</ol>
