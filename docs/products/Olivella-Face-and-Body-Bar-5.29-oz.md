      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but now that my skin is more combiniation</li>
      <li>It also has a VERY strong medicinal smell which is a bit too strong for what I&#x27;d prefer in a soap and probably part of what causes me to break out.  </li>
      <li>I use this on my face because it leaves it feeling smooth and hydrated</li>
      <li>I asked for fragrance free soap and was sent this.  </li>
      <li>These will be given as gifts and I&#x27;ll try the Body Bar and see if that comes thru as fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>I love how this soap makes my face feel and look.its makes my face nice and clean and it makes my face look clear.</li>
      <li>But after doing research, I found that it would be better for her to use a more natural soap.</li>
      <li>The oil itself is wonderful - only natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, rinses clean and makes my skin soft.</li>
      <li>It lathers well, smells fresh, gets</li>

      <li>found the soap itself to be moisturizing and very gentle.</li>
      <li>This soap does not work for me due to my sensitive skin, but may be great for others who do not have this challenge.</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good, basic option if you have dry skin or are looking for more natural skin care products.</li>
      <li>Soft, clean smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to decipher what ingredient it is in some soaps that gives me a strange &#x27;surface rash&#x27; on my skin (&#x27;surface&#x27; being that there are raised bumps that scab over</li>
      <li>If you can get past the Raid roach spray smell then this soap is good for you.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoyed how it doesn&#x27;t dry out or itch my skin.</li>
      <li>He used to be really dry and skin flakes would shed off, but now I can tell that his skin looks more moisturized throughout the day.</li>
      <li>My husband loves the scent and I love the fact that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out after using this soap.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for a bar of soap that was pure olive oil.</li>
      <li>It feels luxurious to use them even though they are reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes very well, but doesn&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this bar soap if had a raid roach spray smell, but after using it did make my skin real soft, but can&#x27;t take the smell - it went in the garbage.  </li>
      <li>It has a very fragrant lavender scent even though there&#x27;s no mention of any type of fragrance on the webpage or the container it comes in.</li>
      <li>And really moisturizes.</li>
      <li>The representative at Touch of Europe said it was fragrance free, but it definitely is not.</li>
      <li>Bought soap for granddaughter who can&#x27;t use any kind of soap, she didn&#x27;t like it, it looked like green mud.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really made the skin on my face much softer, especially when used with a moisturizer right after.</li>
      <li>Still, your face and skin need all the help they can get while you get older.</li>
      <li>When you apply moisturizer after bathing, it really soaks in and leaves your skin so soft.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it for the extra money</li>
      <li>I have very dry itchy skin; but since using this soap the last two or more years, I have had relief from my irritable skin problem.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>and now I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
      <li>makes my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>I am 47 years old and have had acne problems at my age!  </li>
      <li>Also, make sure to not leave the bar sitting in any water because it will cause the bar to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; and get very messy and lose it&#x27;s shape.  </li>
      <li>Not painful, but not pretty).  </li>
      <li>It made my face soft, and it controlled her breakouts as well.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m OLD.</li>
      <li>Does not dry out your skin and leaves it feeling soft with no greasy feel.</li>
      <li>Anyone sensitive to fragrances in their bath and body products should double check before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t dissapate real fast like other soaps and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It does not dry you out.</li>
      <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Normally, when you have a new full-sized bar it&#x27;s a little hard to lather up and feels very oily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This soap is great!! I have had very dry skin for yrs. but not after using this soap for the past seven mo. It lathers well, smells fresh, gets ur skin super clean n rinses off completely...no residue. Yay!! It moisturizes very well, but doesn&#x27;t overdo it. &lt;br /&gt; It lasts a long time if put in a place where it can drain...doesn&#x27;t crack once dry. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has dry, scaly skin. I had him use it for a while and I think it&#x27;s made a difference for him. He used to be really dry and skin flakes would shed off, but now I can tell that his skin looks more moisturized throughout the day. Good product.</li>
    <li> This would be a 5 if it did not have fragrance to it. The oil itself is wonderful - only natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I started using olive oil soap bars a year ago and now I can&#x27;t live without them. It&#x27;s really made the skin on my face much softer, especially when used with a moisturizer right after. This brand is a very nice soap and I like it more than the Kiss My Face bars.  It has a very fragrant lavender scent even though there&#x27;s no mention of any type of fragrance on the webpage or the container it comes in. I like lavender so that&#x27;s a plus.  It&#x27;s wonderful to use for shaving. I don&#x27;t bother using shaving cream or gel anymore. After shaving I apply aftershave/moisturizer and my face becomes like a baby&#x27;s behind. Seriously, I&#x27;ll be touching my face all day marveling at how soft it is.  One major negative thing I&#x27;ve noticed about olive oil bars is that they seem to run out of olive oil before they&#x27;re completely used up. You&#x27;ll notice this when the bar becomes very easy to lather and is not as greasy. Normally, when you have a new full-sized bar it&#x27;s a little hard to lather up and feels very oily. Then when there&#x27;s about 15-20% of the bar left, the greasyness is gone and it soaps up almost immediately. You can tell it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well then. I just use it for washing my hands at that point.  Also, make sure to not leave the bar sitting in any water because it will cause the bar to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; and get very messy and lose it&#x27;s shape.  Another bad thing is that olive oil bars are usually more expensive than regular bars. So not only do the moisturizing benefits run out before the bar is totally used up but you have to pay more for it.  Still, your face and skin need all the help they can get while you get older. I think it&#x27;s worth it for the extra money and you&#x27;ll definitely notice the difference. Thumbs up for this product!</li>
    <li> This is a standard in my home.  My husband loves the scent and I love the fact that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out after using this soap.</li>
    <li> Throw away your moisterizer. Don&#x27;t need it after taking a shower or a bath with this soap. After using this product, you&#x27;ll never go back to what you were using before.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin. I use this on my face because it leaves it feeling smooth and hydrated</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to decipher what ingredient it is in some soaps that gives me a strange &#x27;surface rash&#x27; on my skin (&#x27;surface&#x27; being that there are raised bumps that scab over but they don&#x27;t itch and they&#x27;re not red. Not painful, but not pretty).  But, turns out that this soap does this to me.  It also has a VERY strong medicinal smell which is a bit too strong for what I&#x27;d prefer in a soap and probably part of what causes me to break out.  So, QUALIFIER:  This soap does not work for me due to my sensitive skin, but may be great for others who do not have this challenge.</li>
    <li> this one is good. what else can one say. It does  what it is supposed to do. Try it, you skin  just might like it.</li>
    <li> This soap has an unpleasant medicinal smell. I asked for fragrance free soap and was sent this.  The representative at Touch of Europe said it was fragrance free, but it definitely is not.</li>
    <li> All my face was covered with acne after one week using olivella soap. definitely this soap is not good for me.</li>
    <li> Have used Olivella products including this one for years and my lovely skin reflects it. Compliments galore. And I&#x27;m OLD.</li>
    <li> This was really a great soap. Didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry and it is a great cleanser. I will be looking for more Olive oil items.</li>
    <li> I have very dry itchy skin; but since using this soap the last two or more years, I have had relief from my irritable skin problem. I even use it on my children who have similar skin problem. My skin is noticeably smoother especially during the winter months.</li>
    <li> If you can get past the Raid roach spray smell then this soap is good for you.  The first time I used this bar soap if had a raid roach spray smell, but after using it did make my skin real soft, but can&#x27;t take the smell - it went in the garbage.  I purchased the bar soap because I do use the liquid soap and Iove it but the bar soap is horrible.</li>
    <li> Olivella Face and Body Bar soap is an excellent soap made with olive oil, that leave my hands and face clean This soap gives off a pleasant musky aroma!</li>
    <li> I thought I had found a great soap but I can&#x27;t tolerate the very strong fragrance it gives off even without opening the box. It even says \\&quot;Hypoallergenic\\&quot;!  I see nothing in the description on Amazon saying it has fragrance.  And why ruin something by putting fragrance .  These will be given as gifts and I&#x27;ll try the Body Bar and see if that comes thru as fragrance free.  Big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I am 51 so my oily days are behind me. If I was younger this probably would not work well but now that my skin is more combiniation it works well for the face. It is awesome on the whole body though. Does not dry out your skin and leaves it feeling soft with no greasy feel. Would recommend giving it a try</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a bar of soap that was pure olive oil. This is what I found. The commercial soaps I have been using all my life really dry my skin out. I am African-American and in using this bar of soap I have noticed my skin seems to glow. Not to mention the bar lasts a long time! Good product!</li>
    <li> Love it. makes my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> Love the silky consistency of this soap. Does not lather a lot but it feels silky on the skin. Don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. Soft, clean smell. And really moisturizes. I will continue to use this soap. I love Olivella products. It feels luxurious to use them even though they are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> My order arrived promptly and well packaged, very happy with service:). As for the product, I love this soap!  It smells nice, rinses clean and makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Bought soap for granddaughter who can&#x27;t use any kind of soap, she didn&#x27;t like it, it looked like green mud.  She would use it and bated the way it smelled.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about 2 months now.  It is great for all parts of the body, including the face.  I am 47 years old and have had acne problems at my age!  It has actually helped. When you apply moisturizer after bathing, it really soaks in and leaves your skin so soft.  It also doesn&#x27;t dissapate real fast like other soaps and lasts a long time. The larage bars I have are only half used and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my daughter because I read online that \\&quot;natural\\&quot; soaps can help with Acne. She typically uses products with hydrogen peroxide. But after doing research, I found that it would be better for her to use a more natural soap. So after receiving it, I tried it out for myself, and the soap is amazing. It made my face soft, and it controlled her breakouts as well. I definitely recommend this soap, to anyone.</li>
    <li> all products received and met expections. thank you</li>
    <li> I thought I had ordered the fragrance-free version of this product. Upon opening the package, however, I was overwhelmed by a very strong flowery, herbal scent. This seemed to tone down with use (or maybe I&#x27;ve just become accustomed to it). Anyone sensitive to fragrances in their bath and body products should double check before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the soap itself to be moisturizing and very gentle. There&#x27;s nothing particularly magical or miraculous about it. Still, it&#x27;s a good, basic option if you have dry skin or are looking for more natural skin care products.</li>
    <li> I used it for face and body since traditionally soaps irritate my skin.  I really enjoyed how it doesn&#x27;t dry out or itch my skin.</li>
    <li> I love how this soap makes my face feel and look.its makes my face nice and clean and it makes my face look clear. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> this body bar is very good.  It does not dry you out. Just like the body wash it leaves your skin nice and smooth.  I will be buying more of this product too. I wonder if they have the body lotion also.  I will check out the site.  Thanks.</li>
