    <li> Bought as one the  gifts for my sister.. she loves clinique.. and likes the perfume.. but unfortunately the perfume was missing.. pretty disappointed main reason I chose this set for her.. was the travel perfume.. would be more stars if it was there. :*</li>
    <li> GREAT set! I have used Clinique makeup and skincare for years, but I missed the fall bonus time at Macy&#x27;s this year. I was happily surprised to find it online! I received it within a few days of ordering, in good condition. The cosmetic package was sealed and all items were intact. Unfortunately for me, the listing I chose wasn&#x27;t totally clear about which color set I was actually ordering. So unless the listing is totally clear you may want to call Amazon first to be sure. Mine said I&#x27;d have a &amp;#34;choice of colors&amp;#34;, but there was no option to choose from and I received the set (nudes) that contains the Angel Red lipstick and a blush that&#x27;s a deep, almost brown shade that wouldn&#x27;t have worked at all on my light skin. Beautiful colors, but not for me, so I sent them back and was credited fairly quickly (maybe a week later). A bit disappointing to have to wait, but in the end I got the right colors and am using them very happily now!</li>
    <li> The Happy perfume bottle was empty. I think this was previously used stuff</li>
    <li> The bags!!!  Oh my goodness. The bags are so cute!!  The make up was great too.</li>
    <li> I loved everything in this bag.  I use it everyday.  It was shipped perfectly and fast.  This is something I would recommend to anyone.  AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Wow....great little items! I love it.... !!!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected and very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, I really recomend it</li>
    <li> Overall i liked this set, i bougth 2, my complaint is that in one is missing the little parfum , and the other set Came with a ligth médium cc cream</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 20 years and hope to continue using it for another 20 years. Love it.</li>
