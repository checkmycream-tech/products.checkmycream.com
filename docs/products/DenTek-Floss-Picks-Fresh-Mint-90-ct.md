### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so you have to jam 3 more between your teeth to get it out!!!</li>
      <li>very good one , Dentek is my brand</li>
      <li>It seemed like a good idea - and it is!  </li>
      <li>This was an excellent item, great price, and fast shipping, making it a great seller as well!!!</li>
      <li>lol  Gonna need some more soon</li>
      <li>I just finished up a pack of 90, and am here today to buy more!</li>
      <li>My teeth are perfectly spaced and straight and this floss can&#x27;t get between my teeth.  </li>
      <li>So, 5x more effective at 2/3 the price.</li>
      <li>They start shredding after one tooth, leaving more bits of floss in my teeth than what they take out.</li>
      <li>Much better mint flavor and the floss glides smoothly between teeth and does not fray.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get them in and out of the spaces easily either.</li>
      <li>The P.O.S&#x27; get stuck between most teeth (unless there&#x27;s a sizeable gap) and quickly come unraveled and break.</li>
      <li>Unless you have huge, gappy spaces between your teeth these will get stuck.  </li>
      <li>you cant even fit them between your teeth.</li>
      <li>The floss frays and breaks off almost immediately, even on smooth surfaces with plenty of space between teeth.</li>
      <li>It makes my gum bleed like hell, and it also makes a squeaking sound when they go between my teeth, giving me goosebumps every time.  </li>
      <li>I floss regularly and have to use 2, 3, or even more each time because they break so easily!    </li>
      <li>Triple Clean Floss picks in Fresh mint</li>
      <li>DenTek Triple Clean Floss Picks, Fresh Mint.  </li>
      <li>Those are smooth, high quality picks that easily get between your teeth.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about those old 1 star reviews (dated 2009), but I do know I love these floss picks.  </li>
      <li>I use floss picks every day, and the good ones are terrific and make dental hygiene much easier to maintain.</li>
      <li>Literally every other one I have used is vastly superior to this.  </li>
      <li>I thought he was exaggerating and tried myself, but he was right.</li>
      <li>I can only recommend them for nouveau crafters who are also clever with pipe cleaners; they might be able to find a use for them.</li>
      <li>I find the floss plenty strong, and in fact will use a pick until either the floss or the tip on the pick breaks -- several days.  </li>
      <li>The fiber used is cheap, does not fit between your teeth, and breaks easily.</li>
      <li>Someone needs to report them to the FDA, the product is very substandard, and shouldn&#x27;t be sold to anyone.</li>
      <li>These flosser-substitutes cost about 3 cents each, and that&#x27;s about 2.5 cents too much.  </li>
      <li>Would never purchase and won&#x27;t even be using the last of the free sample</li>
      <li>The floss falls apart after the top row of teeth, leaving bits of string stuck in them, and the pick at the end is extremely sharp and stabs your hands.</li>
      <li>the generic Safeway brand floss picks worked great, usually one of them lasted through all teeth.  </li>
      <li>Unlike many other brands, the handle/pick is actually slim enough to get between my teeth and be useful.</li>
      <li>DO NOT waste your money!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge waste of money</li>
      <li>Incapable of performing the *ONE* action for which they as named.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re extremely frustrating to use, breaking quickly on contact with anything but the very smoothest tooth, and the very largest of space betwwen teeth.</li>
      <li>The thread in these is thick, so it doesn&#x27;t slide easily between your teeth.  </li>
      <li>even though they are thick, they STILL break easy.  </li>
      <li>Yes, they will leave pieces of their loosely attached floss stuck between your teetch, leaving you in the unusual position of using floss to remove the floss between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Like all the other reviews, this is WAY too thick to fit between your teeth.  </li>
<li> These floss picks consistently break and you have to use at least 2 to floss once.</li>
<li> Oral-B Advantage Floss Picks Plus Scope Outlast, Long Lasting Mint 75 ea]].</li>
<li> The textured pattern on the pick helps sweep out loose foods and get anything that might be starting to stick to your teeth.  </li>
<li> were actually able to get through all of my teeth without getting destroyed, and they didn&#x27;t have a dangerous spike at the end.  </li>
<li> The floss fell apart quickly and actually got stuck in my teeth making it worse!  </li>
<li> Just an awful product, not even remotely useful for what it is marketed as being able to do.  </li>
<li> ANd when i finally got it in i had to pull so hard that it came out with such force that the pointy end jabbed me and i am now bleeding as I type this!!!</li>
<li> Plain and simple.  </li>
<li> the other hand</li>
<li> I go through at least two every time because they break completely half way through flossing, and sometimes I&#x27;ll have to use a third</li>
<li> These flossers are covered with gadgets and trinkets that serve no purpose, save making them more difficult to use and expensive to manufacture.</li>
<li> These are trash picks, the CVS picks that I bought for half the price</li>
<li> As often as not, they leave bits of the floss between the teeth, meaning that you have to get out other floss in order to remove the floss fragments left behind by these picks.</li>
<li> On the other hand, it&#x27;s extremely frustrating to buy a product like this brand, as they are unbelievably fragile.</li>
<li> Instead of removing food from between your teeth, it actually makes the matter worse because the floss comes apart and gets stuck too.</li>
<li> Boyfriend tried one and said he could not fit them between teeth.</li>
<li> After flossing just a few spaces the floss had turned furry and was leaving small particles of fiber wedged in between my teeth.</li>
<li> /&gt;This is just a terrible design, as are most of these cheaper, short-handled handles with floss strung between two posts.  </li>
<li> You will need to use at least two picks per space in the teeth if you have teeth that are close together.</li>
<li> OMG...I need to floss my teeth after every meal, and I seriously have to go through 3 or 4 before I get one that doesn&#x27;t snap immediately.</li>
<li> This is absolutely the worst dental pick ever!  </li>
<li> Absolutely worthless and possibly could cause some damage.  </li>
<li> I tried anyways, but the floss is really poorly constructed and shredded.</li>
<li> The \\&quot;shred resistant\\&quot; claim is false advertising.</li>
<li> I usually never complain, but seriously - these are the worst floss picks I have ever used.</li>
<li> The floss frays and gets stuck in your teeth, the pick is flimsy and overall they are a bad time!</li>
<li> and I can&#x27;t believe the company gets away with selling a product that makes the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve worse!</li>
<li> Stay the hell away from this useless garbage.</li>
<li> Come on DenTek, take these crap off the shelf so no more customers will suffer from these.</li>
<li> They are impossible to work between your teeth to the point of being uncomfortable.</li>
<li> this is probably the worst dental flossers I have ever used.</li>
<li> but this is way worst.  </li>
<li> , they are HORRIBLE.</li>
<li> These are terrible.</li>

    <li> These floss picks are a nightmare. Unless you have huge, gappy spaces between your teeth these will get stuck.  Last night I had to cut the floss out with a pair of scissors because it got stuck between two of my molars.  My teeth are perfectly spaced and straight and this floss can&#x27;t get between my teeth.  Absolutely worthless and possibly could cause some damage.  DO NOT PURCHASE!!</li>
    <li> Did they even try doing a test run on these flossers on themselves??? you cant even fit them between your teeth. ANd when i finally got it in i had to pull so hard that it came out with such force that the pointy end jabbed me and i am now bleeding as I type this!!! this is probably the worst dental flossers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This product is garbage. The floss falls apart after the top row of teeth, leaving bits of string stuck in them, and the pick at the end is extremely sharp and stabs your hands.

    <li> These floss picks consistently break and you have to use at least 2 to floss once.</li>
    <li> I received a sample 3 pack of these DenTek Triple Clean Floss picks in Fresh mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, they are HORRIBLE. Boyfriend tried one and said he could not fit them between teeth. I thought he was exaggerating and tried myself, but he was right. They are impossible to work between your teeth to the point of being uncomfortable. I tried anyways, but the floss is really poorly constructed and shredded. After flossing just a few spaces the floss had turned furry and was leaving small particles of fiber wedged in between my teeth. Also the mint flavor was nowhere to be found. Would never purchase and won&#x27;t even be using the last of the free sample it&#x27;s that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and instead purchase the [[ASIN:B002P8FE8S Oral-B Advantage Floss Picks Plus Scope Outlast, Long Lasting Mint 75 ea]]. Much better mint flavor and the floss glides smoothly between teeth and does not fray.</li>
    <li> These are terrible. I floss regularly and have to use 2, 3, or even more each time because they break so easily!    I bought these because the Dentek Comfort Silk picks were out of stock. Those are smooth, high quality picks that easily get between your teeth. The P.O.S&#x27; get stuck between most teeth (unless there&#x27;s a sizeable gap) and quickly come unraveled and break. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Every time I put flossers on my shopping list for someone to pick up for me I wind up with these (they must be the cheapest) and every time I wind up having to throw them away. They start shredding after one tooth, leaving more bits of floss in my teeth than what they take out. I go through at least two every time because they break completely half way through flossing, and sometimes I&#x27;ll have to use a third just just get the rogue bits of floss out. I can&#x27;t get them in and out of the spaces easily either. It&#x27;s a huge waste of money and I can&#x27;t believe the company gets away with selling a product that makes the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve worse! The \\&quot;shred resistant\\&quot; claim is false advertising.</li>
    <li> I usually never complain, but seriously - these are the worst floss picks I have ever used. The only reason I bought them is because the store I was in did not have the Plackers brand. I will never buy these things again. The floss frays and gets stuck in your teeth, the pick is flimsy and overall they are a bad time! Instead of removing food from between your teeth, it actually makes the matter worse because the floss comes apart and gets stuck too. DO NOT waste your money!</li>
    <li> very good one , Dentek is my brand</li>
    <li> These flosser-substitutes cost about 3 cents each, and that&#x27;s about 2.5 cents too much.  They&#x27;re extremely frustrating to use, breaking quickly on contact with anything but the very smoothest tooth, and the very largest of space betwwen teeth. Yes, they will leave pieces of their loosely attached floss stuck between your teetch, leaving you in the unusual position of using floss to remove the floss between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a terrible design, as are most of these cheaper, short-handled handles with floss strung between two posts.

Stick with Plackers.</li>
    <li> Item just as described.</li>
    <li> Trash.  Plain and simple.  Incapable of performing the *ONE* action for which they as named.  These are not FLOSS picks.  If you attempt to FLOSS with them they *will* shred and leave pieced stuck between your teeth and gums.  You will need to use at least two picks per space in the teeth if you have teeth that are close together. Completely unacceptable to use these only to be left with the feeling of having wide &#x27;hairs&#x27; stuck in your teeth.  Do not use. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> The thread in these is thick, so it doesn&#x27;t slide easily between your teeth.  Then you have to figure out how to remove it.  Just an awful product, not even remotely useful for what it is marketed as being able to do.  What I learned: DenTek &#x3D; stay away!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst dental pick ever!  I thought those Walgreen brand sucked because each time I had to use 2 or 3, but this is way worst.  Like all the other reviews, this is WAY too thick to fit between your teeth.  It makes my gum bleed like hell, and it also makes a squeaking sound when they go between my teeth, giving me goosebumps every time.  What I don&#x27;t get is even though they are thick, they STILL break easy.  Come on DenTek, take these crap off the shelf so no more customers will suffer from these.</li>
    <li> i keep these close and use them often for picking and flossing.  lol  Gonna need some more soon, i like the wiggle ends.</li>
    <li> OMG...I need to floss my teeth after every meal, and I seriously have to go through 3 or 4 before I get one that doesn&#x27;t snap immediately. Thus making these \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; pickers more expensive as each one can&#x27;t be counted on to be used.  And then I have to use additional ones because the one that didn&#x27;t snap immediately gets shredded after cleaning just 2 or 3 teeth spaces.  Literally every other one I have used is vastly superior to this.  NEVER buy them.  Lord knows I never will again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try these bc flossing with regular floss always hurts my fingers and these seemed so easy...uh NOT! I have to rip them from between my teeth and 4 out of 5 times they break, so you use double the amount in one floss. AND the floss shreds between your teeth so you have to jam 3 more between your teeth to get it out!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about those old 1 star reviews (dated 2009), but I do know I love these floss picks.  Unlike many other brands, the handle/pick is actually slim enough to get between my teeth and be useful. The textured pattern on the pick helps sweep out loose foods and get anything that might be starting to stick to your teeth.  I find the floss plenty strong, and in fact will use a pick until either the floss or the tip on the pick breaks -- several days.  I just finished up a pack of 90, and am here today to buy more!</li>
    <li> It seemed like a good idea - and it is!  But DenTek was not the solution.  The floss fell apart quickly and actually got stuck in my teeth making it worse!  Took me about 5-6 of the picks just to get through all of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand the generic Safeway brand floss picks worked great, usually one of them lasted through all teeth.  So, 5x more effective at 2/3 the price.</li>
    <li> These are trash picks, the CVS picks that I bought for half the price were actually able to get through all of my teeth without getting destroyed, and they didn&#x27;t have a dangerous spike at the end.  Stay the hell away from this useless garbage.</li>
    <li> DenTek Triple Clean Floss Picks, Fresh Mint.  This was an excellent item, great price, and fast shipping, making it a great seller as well!!!</li>
    <li> I wish there was a 0 rating on these floss picks. This is one of the biggest ripoffs hoisted on the consumer. The fiber used is cheap, does not fit between your teeth, and breaks easily. Also the pick breaks off, and gets lodged between your teeth. It took me about 3-4 of these floss picks to floss my teeth. Even then, my teeth weren&#x27;t flossed properly. Someone needs to report them to the FDA, the product is very substandard, and shouldn&#x27;t be sold to anyone.</li>
