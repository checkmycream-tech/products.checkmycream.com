      <li>I will say this -- \\&quot;BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\\</li>
      <li>Very comfortable to sleep in.</li>
      <li>She has been pleased.</li>
      <li>I am not 100% sure how to use it</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>The drawback is many of the seams are not sealed, the wires are exposed.</li>
      <li>and it is extremely safe for your hair 400% safe.</li>
      <li>Great for soft sprial curls.</li>
      <li>The material of the rollers does not grip my hair so they fall out too easily and don&#x27;t leave a curl.</li>
      <li>In any event, one can easily reinforce the seams.</li>
      <li>They really do run large, so be sure this is the size you want!</li>
      <li>Easy to set and sleep in without feeling a bump for real and no head aches when you wake up in the morning.</li>
      <li>They curl tightly very quickly and are gentle on hair.</li>
      <li>Yeah got the product real fast within 4 days</li>
      <li>Slide right out.</li>
      <li>and I have to buy more on a regular basis.  </li>
      <li>okay for short hair.</li>
      <li>Not sure if this will work for all, but for hair as I described, and expecially for those with long hair that is braided before rolling, these are almost perfect.</li>
      <li>These rollers are very gentle on the hair and creates soft waves/curls.</li>
      <li>With these rollers they give a beautifull long lasting bouncy curl and yes the foam is wrapped in its little satin pillow( satin is very good for ethnic hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll have to check out a few more videos on youtube to see if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll use often</li>
      <li>and I live in the caribbean</li>
      <li>The idea behind the product is great, but it doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair because the wires are too short.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend them to any woman who wants to avoid using the flat/curling iron and wants soft waves or curls, and doesn&#x27;t mind using hair rollers at night.</li>
      <li>When I use these rollers I notice that my ends (and the rest of the hair) are glossy, silky and soft!</li>
      <li>Too bad they can&#x27;t perfect the stitching to last longer.</li>
      <li>you get that professional roller set curled hair without visiting the beauty salon</li>
      <li>OUT THERE KNOW HOW TO MAKE SOFT ROLLERS THAT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE</li>
      <li>No more crisp, crunchy hair ends even after moisturing pretty well the night before.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even bother to return the other 2 unopened packs -- simply wasn&#x27;t worth my time to return.    </li>
      <li>It says Large rollers and they were not Large at all</li>
      <li>These rollers are really soft but they don&#x27;t work well for short hair.</li>
      <li>not really for long hair it just slip right off, but</li>
      <li>Not good for fine hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Got these for a good price and got more to have as a reserve . I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> not really for long hair it just slip right off, but okay for short hair. I gave it to my sister with shorter hair and she likes it.</li>
    <li> Great rollers.  Only complaint is they wear out over time and I have to buy more on a regular basis.  Too bad they can&#x27;t perfect the stitching to last longer.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 packages of these rollers and I am very pleased with the results. I have shoulder length black relaxed hair and was looking for a replacement of my sponge rollers as I finally realized  they were damaging to my hair type (i.e., eventually dries out or removes any moisture in my hair). These rollers are very gentle on the hair and creates soft waves/curls. When I use these rollers I notice that my ends (and the rest of the hair) are glossy, silky and soft! No more crisp, crunchy hair ends even after moisturing pretty well the night before. I find that the 20 rollers are sufficient for my hair length and thickness (medium in thickness). I would definitely recommend them to any woman who wants to avoid using the flat/curling iron and wants soft waves or curls, and doesn&#x27;t mind using hair rollers at night. Finally, I didn&#x27;t rate this product a \\&quot;5\\&quot; star as I noticed a few rollers&#x27; wires have already poked through the material as the seams have slightly unraveled. In any event, one can easily reinforce the seams.</li>
    <li> I have long,coarse hair that is also processed so I cannot use sponge rollers and other rollers like magnetic or other types are just too hard to sleep on during the night or even for a few minutes. With these rollers they give a beautifull long lasting bouncy curl and yes the foam is wrapped in its little satin pillow( satin is very good for ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all my fault.  I read the mixed reviews and still made the purchase.  These rollers are not for people with long hair.  The twists are too short, and you really look bad when you&#x27;ve rolled your hair.  \\&quot;I LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND FELT LIKE A COMPLETE IDIOT!!!! DOES ANYONE OUT THERE KNOW HOW TO MAKE SOFT ROLLERS THAT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE YOU&#x27;RE A MEMBER OF THE LITTLE RASCALS???\\&quot; I was so hopeful that I actually bought 3 packs - what a mistake.  I didn&#x27;t even bother to return the other 2 unopened packs -- simply wasn&#x27;t worth my time to return.    I will say this -- \\&quot;BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\\&quot;  Would I recommend? \\&quot;**LLLL NOOOO.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The idea behind the product is great, but it doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair because the wires are too short.</li>
    <li> They really do run large, so be sure this is the size you want! This is my 2nd time purchasing (total 3 packs med/large). The drawback is many of the seams are not sealed, the wires are exposed. This snags the lock or ends up sliding out of the roller-which is why i&#x27;m reordering. The comfort of them is amzing. The quality with which they are made leaves room for improvement.</li>
    <li> I really do not enjoy sleeping in rollers....I can make an exception with these rollers....I also ordered a few packages for my aunt who has shorter hair than I.  She has been pleased.</li>
    <li> It says Large rollers and they were not Large at all</li>
    <li> Not good for fine hair. Slide right out.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to sleep in. Great curls too</li>
    <li> Not made for long thick hair but worked for my sisters shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Great product if you are like me. (Hate rollers of any kind)  These you barley know they are there. Great for soft sprial curls.</li>
    <li> The pillow solft roller does give you a good finished roller set curl. Easy to set and sleep in without feeling a bump for real and no head aches when you wake up in the morning.I received the product before I can say \\&quot;Saturday\\&quot;. Yeah got the product real fast within 4 days and I live in the caribbean amazing truly amazing. The rollers are really good you get that professional roller set curled hair without visiting the beauty salon and it is extremely safe for your hair 400% safe. I love it the only thing is that after a few uses my roller&#x27;s wire are starting to go hay wire but it still lasts and creates beautiful, lustrous curls.</li>
    <li> These rollers are so slippery that they don&#x27;t stay in your hair. Though they are very inexpensive, don&#x27;t waste even 10 cents of your money on them.</li>
    <li> These rollers are really soft but they don&#x27;t work well for short hair. These are for long hair only.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick African American hair. These rollers worked well for me. They curl tightly very quickly and are gentle on hair. The satin cover is what I need for my coarse hair. Not sure if this will work for all, but for hair as I described, and expecially for those with long hair that is braided before rolling, these are almost perfect.</li>
    <li> These are a big waste of money. The fabric is so slick that it cannot grip your hair. Just try to find anything else.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t stay in my hair</li>
    <li> The material of the rollers does not grip my hair so they fall out too easily and don&#x27;t leave a curl.</li>
    <li> I am not 100% sure how to use it but I&#x27;ll have to check out a few more videos on youtube to see if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll use often</li>
