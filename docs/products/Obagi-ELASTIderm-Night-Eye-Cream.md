### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I am REALLY happy to find this on Amazon!!!!</li>
      <li>The area around my eyes stays perfectly moisturized, not too moist so that my concealer &amp; eyeshadow disappears but all the dryness I was experiencing is gone.</li>
      <li>THE COMBO WORK FANTASTIC!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best eye cream I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I bought this eye cream because of the great reputation of Obaji....</li>
      <li>Thank God for amazon and their great products and service.</li>
      <li>I am so happy.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Ogagi ELASTIderm Night Eye Cream for about two years now and think it is a great product.  </li>
      <li>If she&#x27;s happy and it makes her look good</li>
      <li>Also good under makeup.</li>
      <li>but it is not as good as the night eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I have read many great reviews on the products purchased, so I know I should have seen results by now (3.5 months).</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I use the Obagi line and find all of the products effective.  </li>
      <li>Noticed that the puffiness under my eyes was greatly reduced within the first week of using it.</li>
      <li>but I really love this one.</li>
      <li>Can someone recommend a reputable Vendor on Amazon who sells Obagi?  </li>
      <li>Have ordered this product many times and just ordered again.  </li>
      <li>Just stick with it as the results are worthwhile.    </li>
      <li>, what more can you ask.  </li>
      <li>Oh yeah, there is one thing better...</li>
      <li>The price is just a bit more than Olay but the results are so much better.</li>
      <li>Have been using this eye cream for more than six months.  </li>
      <li>Started using this for my eyes about 3yrs ago and love the what it does.</li>
      <li>Was so pleased I got a jar for my mother and mother in law.</li>
      <li>the night eye cream is better.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR FINE LINES UNDER THE EYES..</li>
      <li>I am a 32 year old, who decided to invest in really great products.</li>
      <li>I bought this eye cream a week ago and really liked it at first, but then after i went through one jar and bought another, I don&#x27;t see any improvement in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>and I have used it since 2006 when I started noticing fine lines and the beginning of crow&#x27;s feet at the outer edge.  </li>
      <li>I like that the product is light, not greasy, and does not cause any burning around or even if I accidentally get some in my eyes.     </li>
      <li>Even just using it on my eyes, it goes quickly.</li>
      <li>This really does reduce fine lines around eyes.  </li>
      <li>It really seems to keep the area around my eyes smooth.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the additional cost.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light eye cream, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and you look amazing in the morning.  </li>
      <li>although not &#x27;drugstore priced&#x27; is very reasonable for a premium skin care line.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>This product does smooth fine lines around my eyes &amp; gives a slight glow.</li>
      <li>After over five years of using Elastiderm, not only did the fine lines evaporate</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of all the Obagi products although the initial phase is a bit aggressive</li>
      <li>The Professional C serum 15% was clear, and runny like baby oil and smelled like alcohol, the eye cream was baby blue in color and light on the eyes, cleanser is a rose color gel and smells like roses, day lotion is also a white cream and smells like roses and orange.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using this product for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>I particularly like Elastiderm Night Eye Cream</li>
      <li>Luckily, this company contacted me last night and is willing to take it back and reimburse me, so I would highly reccomend this seller.  </li>
      <li>I was very surprised as I also ordered the day cream.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too early to decide if the product is working</li>
      <li>I am 62 years old and my dermatologist told me that I look like I&#x27;m 50.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Obagi C Gel Cleanser, Elastidern Eye Cream, Obagi C Exfoliating Day Lotion, and Professional- C serum 15% since November.</li>
      <li>The small spots on my forehead have not disappeared, and tiny fine lines around my eyes are still there.</li>

    <li> I bought this eye cream a week ago and really liked it at first, but then after i went through one jar and bought another, I don&#x27;t see any improvement in the fine lines around my eyes.  Not happy with it.    Luckily, this company contacted me last night and is willing to take it back and reimburse me, so I would highly reccomend this seller.  Laura</li>
    <li> The product was not what I ordered.  I received the eye cream for day.  I was very surprised as I also ordered the day cream.  I probably will not order from this vendor again.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this cream and have been using it for over a year. My eyes were burnt and this is the only cream that did not irritate my skin. It keeps the skin hydrated without being greasy. Also good under makeup.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other eye creams over the years but this one was different, I actually noticed a difference in the small lines &amp; dryness around my eyes. They actually seems to disappear. I had ordered the Night Cream but received the regular Eye Cream that could be used day &amp; night instead. I love it! Maybe someday I will try the Night Cream but I really love this one. I think I was meant to get this one! The area around my eyes stays perfectly moisturized, not too moist so that my concealer &amp; eyeshadow disappears but all the dryness I was experiencing is gone. I am so happy. The price is just a bit more than Olay but the results are so much better. Well worth the additional cost. I wish I could put it all over my face!</li>
    <li> This advertisement is misleading, this is not the eye night cream but rather just the eye cream.  I like this product but it is not as good as the night eye cream.  If you look closely at the photos, it even says eye cream, not night eye cream.  I have used both and the night eye cream is better.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Ogagi ELASTIderm Night Eye Cream for about two years now and think it is a great product.  I am 62 years old and my dermatologist told me that I look like I&#x27;m 50.  I was getting this product from the derm&#x27;s office but have found that I can get it on Amazon for about 30 dollars less.  It really seems to keep the area around my eyes smooth.  It also lasts a long time as I only need to use a little bit.</li>
    <li> I started using the Obagi ELASTIderm Night Eye Cream November 2011, and noticed a big difference in reducing the wrinkles around my eye area almost immediately! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This product does smooth fine lines around my eyes &amp; gives a slight glow. I use this at night &amp; in the morning before applying makup. It&#x27;s the best eye cream I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how the Obagi people do it, but my deep inset eyes no longer have extra flappy skin trying to put an extra fold into my eyelid area.  I have been using this over a year and have never had such a result from a topical cream.  Miraculous results!</li>
    <li> Started using this for my eyes about 3yrs ago and love the what it does. I get compliments all the time. I&#x27;ll keep using this product for as long as it&#x27;s available. Received it with no problems and on time!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this eye cream because of the great reputation of Obaji....the texture is very thin, I notice no improvement, and think the product as sold through this vendor is mediocre.</li>
    <li> This product really works! I&#x27;m 64 and have tried lot&#x27;s of &#x27;em...this is the one! Thank God for amazon and their great products and service.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff and she does look at least ten years younger than her age.  If she&#x27;s happy and it makes her look good, what more can you ask.  Oh yeah, there is one thing better...it sells for half what I can buy it for locally.  Yes!</li>
    <li> I use the Obagi line and find all of the products effective.  I particularly like Elastiderm Night Eye Cream and I have used it since 2006 when I started noticing fine lines and the beginning of crow&#x27;s feet at the outer edge.  After over five years of using Elastiderm, not only did the fine lines evaporate but after this time the product seems to be preventing additional damage.  I like that the product is light, not greasy, and does not cause any burning around or even if I accidentally get some in my eyes.     I am a huge fan of all the Obagi products although the initial phase is a bit aggressive which demonstrates the products are working to remove the upper, dead skin layers.  Just stick with it as the results are worthwhile.    Second the line although not &#x27;drugstore priced&#x27; is very reasonable for a premium skin care line.</li>
    <li> I am a 32 year old, who decided to invest in really great products. My aesthitician recommended the Obagi C for me. I found out that it was cheaper to buy through Amazon and decided to buy the line, through the same vendor on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using the Obagi C Gel Cleanser, Elastidern Eye Cream, Obagi C Exfoliating Day Lotion, and Professional- C serum 15% since November. I have not seen any improvements on my skin, at all!. The small spots on my forehead have not disappeared, and tiny fine lines around my eyes are still there. I continue using the products. I&#x27;m just afraid, that maybe the products purchased were not genuine. I have read many great reviews on the products purchased, so I know I should have seen results by now (3.5 months). Can someone recommend a reputable Vendor on Amazon who sells Obagi?  Or please describe how the products should feel, smell, texture? The Professional C serum 15% was clear, and runny like baby oil and smelled like alcohol, the eye cream was baby blue in color and light on the eyes, cleanser is a rose color gel and smells like roses, day lotion is also a white cream and smells like roses and orange. Please advise. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR FINE LINES UNDER THE EYES.. JUST KNOW YOU STILL NEED TO USE A MOISTUIZER TOO. THE COMBO WORK FANTASTIC!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a light eye cream, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and you look amazing in the morning.  Needs to be accompanied by the morning eye gel.</li>
    <li> I had thin, wrinkly skin under my eyes and it was so bad that I hated wearing eye make-up because it only drew more attention to the area.  This cream is the only cream that has ever worked for me and it did take a week or so to see results.  The office that I buy mine at charges me $90 for a jar so I am REALLY happy to find this on Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Have ordered this product many times and just ordered again.  I do wish the jar was a little bigger.  Even just using it on my eyes, it goes quickly.</li>
    <li> This really does reduce fine lines around eyes.  Was so pleased I got a jar for my mother and mother in law.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to decide if the product is working but my wife told me she doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helping, time will tell.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT BUT I DID NOT GET NIGHT...READ THE REVIEWS ON THE NIGHT CREAM AND WANTED TO TRY  IT BUT GOT THE DAY INSTEAD.</li>
    <li> Have been using this eye cream for more than six months.  Noticed that the puffiness under my eyes was greatly reduced within the first week of using it.</li>
