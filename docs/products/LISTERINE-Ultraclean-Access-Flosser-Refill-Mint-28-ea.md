    <li> i love it.  It makes flossing easy and simple.  REach Aces Flosser.</li>
    <li> I love these and I highly recommend.. When I could not find my reach because Listerine floss took over I had a fit ! Thank goodness I found on Amazon :)</li>
    <li> We have used these flosser heads for a long time and can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore.  I understand that the Listerine flosser and heads are the same or similar product.  I bought several packages so that we won&#x27;t run out soon.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I never glossed before these.  And now I floss every day.  They make it quick and easy.  And way cheaper to buy refills online.</li>
    <li> Have used these with the battery handle for years and seldom have a cavity or gum problems  Unfortunately Reach has discontinued the battery handle -- but these are still great.</li>
    <li> INSTEAD OF REGULAR TYPE FLOSS,I USE THESE FLOSSERS BECAUSE I CAN&#x27;T GET MY GIANT HANDS IN MY MOUTH WELL ENOUGH TO USE REGULAR FLOSS.</li>
    <li> QUick Ship and Perfect</li>
    <li> Much better than other brands I have tried.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very handy. They do the job without a lot of fuss.</li>
    <li> Works great. Have a hard time finding these at the stores</li>
    <li> Perfect. Great price, and fast delivery. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Best price around and they fit in our reach handles.  Very pleased. Seem to be genuine brand name product</li>
    <li> This set up is the only way I can floss the majority of my teeth. I just can&#x27;t do it with regular floss so I didn&#x27;t do it. These have changed that.</li>
    <li> Cant get these in bulk at the storore, so buying these great products keep my teeth and gum free of particles.  Easiest flosser in the world.</li>
