### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best shaving cream I have found.</li>
      <li>Wonderful texture and aroma.</li>
      <li>The scent is excellent and not dominating.</li>
      <li>It lathers great!</li>
      <li>Best shaving cream you can get .</li>
      <li>awesome seller.</li>
      <li>Nice scent, great lather!</li>
      <li>great item.</li>
      <li>So nice to find a great product at a great price!!!</li>
      <li>Most excellent product</li>
      <li>This is a very good cream, but the scent is VERY strong.</li>
      <li>The sandalwood is milder than the AOS brand as I prefer and the wife seems to love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Truefitt &amp; Hill for a number of years now and have it to consistently offer the best shave.</li>
      <li>Amazing lather that requires virtually no effort to work up.</li>
      <li>Nice understated  fragrance.</li>
      <li>This cream smells to me of a good quality cologne that is not too strong but yet smells of cologne unrelated to sandalwood.&lt;br</li>
      <li>lather and quality of the cream are very fine.</li>
      <li>no complaints way better than the bar type</li>
      <li>This is my favorite cream</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
      <li>Top quality shaving product.</li>
      <li>Good product, good price, VERY FAST and reasonable shipping.</li>
      <li>the most comfortable shave</li>
      <li>I have tried a number of shaving creams from Taylor of Old Bond Street (their sandalwood is quite good), Geo .F Trumper, and different varieties from Truefitt &amp; Hill, and I find the Truefitt &amp; Hill Sandalwood Shaving Cream to be the best of all of them.  </li>
      <li>For me, it strikes the perfect balance between some shaving creams (that can dry out) and shaving soaps (which do not often result in a rich lather).  </li>
      <li>This is far and away the best for not only a great and easy lather, but it really makes my shaving smoother and easier and more fun.</li>
      <li>When using, you need to add an ample volume of water to ensure the full benefits of the lather.</li>
      <li>This cream is definitely one of the best, has a nice scent, and lathers up the scuttle nicely from only a small amount on the finger tip.</li>
      <li>I like using a sandalwood scent for shaving my legs, but this was much too strong.</li>
      <li>So; great shave cream that I would highly recommend as long as you do not mind the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Fresh feeling sensation after the shave.</li>
      <li>Easily worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Also the sandlewood smells good, but it&#x27;s subtle, not too overwhelming for my nose</li>
      <li>super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This particular shaving cream does not dry out and creates a nice, moist, creamy lather.</li>
      <li>I really like the Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving creams.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>On the negative side, it smells too good.</li>
      <li>I use sandalwood essential oil and it has a woody, earthy scent that is very distinct.</li>
      <li>What I really like about this shaving cream is that the smell isn&#x27;t too strong but still masculine, unlike the travel tube I don&#x27;t have to pour it into my bowl, I dab my brush and get as much as I need without wasting too much of it, and just a dab or two is enough.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m certain this product would be highly satisfactory to those not looking for a sandalwood scent.</li>
      <li>The price is high, but this lasts me about a year of shaving every 2 or 3 days.</li>
      <li>This is the second time I buy Sandalwood shaving cream, the first time I bought the travel tube</li>
      <li>price might seem high, but it is worth every penny of it when compared against the other brands.</li>
      <li>I have been experimenting with the various high end shaving creams.</li>
      <li>This is my new standard.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> Different scent than other brands of sandalwood shaving cream. Fresh feeling sensation after the shave.</li>
    <li> I am rating this shaving cream on the basis of scent and not quality of the cream itself. The scent is not in any way that of sandalwood. I use sandalwood essential oil and it has a woody, earthy scent that is very distinct. This cream smells to me of a good quality cologne that is not too strong but yet smells of cologne unrelated to sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather and quality of the cream are very fine. And I&#x27;m certain this product would be highly satisfactory to those not looking for a sandalwood scent.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream you can get . Lasts a long time so cost per shave is low.</li>
    <li> Top quality shaving product.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy Sandalwood shaving cream, the first time I bought the travel tube but I found my self over pouring. What I really like about this shaving cream is that the smell isn&#x27;t too strong but still masculine, unlike the travel tube I don&#x27;t have to pour it into my bowl, I dab my brush and get as much as I need without wasting too much of it, and just a dab or two is enough. It lathers great! In a bowl or on my face. I use this to shave my head, I prefer this than using a can gel shaving cream. Trust me you won&#x27;t be dissapointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of shaving creams from Taylor of Old Bond Street (their sandalwood is quite good), Geo .F Trumper, and different varieties from Truefitt &amp; Hill, and I find the Truefitt &amp; Hill Sandalwood Shaving Cream to be the best of all of them.  For me, it strikes the perfect balance between some shaving creams (that can dry out) and shaving soaps (which do not often result in a rich lather).  This particular shaving cream does not dry out and creates a nice, moist, creamy lather.</li>
    <li> Wonderful texture and aroma. This stuff makes me look forward to shaving every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price might seem high, but it is worth every penny of it when compared against the other brands.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a little expensive, but after using it once, I found out what the money difference is all about.  The scent the Truefitt and Hill leaves is such that I hate masking it with aftershave.  In fact, I don&#x27;t now.  This is my new standard.  I can&#x27;t imagine anything topping this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Truefitt &amp; Hill for a number of years now and have it to consistently offer the best shave. When using, you need to add an ample volume of water to ensure the full benefits of the lather. The scent is excellent and not dominating. One tub will last me almost 4 to 6 months with regular shaving (face and scalp).</li>
    <li> Provides a close shave and minimum razor burn!</li>
    <li> This is a very good cream, but the scent is VERY strong. I like using a sandalwood scent for shaving my legs, but this was much too strong. Overall though, it works well and lathers well.</li>
    <li> Most excellent product</li>
    <li> I really like the Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving creams.  I&#x27;ve found it helps minimize acne and in grown hairs on my face. Sandalwood vs. any other scent, I have no preference upon, since they all smell about the same to me.</li>
    <li> I have been experimenting with the various high end shaving creams. Taylor, Duke Cannon, and others. This is far and away the best for not only a great and easy lather, but it really makes my shaving smoother and easier and more fun. It is expensive but it is worth it, one of those items that makes one think: you get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;Bravo.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cream and I&#x27;ve tried many.  I have a pretty tough beard and this is the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve gotten.  I use a Mercuc Bland handle and Feather Plantinum Blades.  The price is high, but this lasts me about a year of shaving every 2 or 3 days. Also the sandlewood smells good, but it&#x27;s subtle, not too overwhelming for my nose and my wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> no complaints way better than the bar type</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is the kitty&#x27;s titties. Amazing lather that requires virtually no effort to work up. On the negative side, it smells too good. I had to start wearing a face mask like Bane from The Dark Night Rises to keep dogs and women from licking my face.</li>
    <li> So nice to find a great product at a great price!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> This cream is definitely one of the best, has a nice scent, and lathers up the scuttle nicely from only a small amount on the finger tip.

So; great shave cream that I would highly recommend as long as you do not mind the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, great lather! The sandalwood is milder than the AOS brand as I prefer and the wife seems to love it! I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing the AS balm in this scent</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, VERY FAST and reasonable shipping.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I have found. Easily worth every penny.</li>
    <li> great item. super fast shipping. awesome seller.</li>
    <li> Quality shaving cream. Nice understated  fragrance. Pricey compared to competition.</li>
