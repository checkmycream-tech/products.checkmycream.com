<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works good on ruff sin</li>
    <li> When I feel really itchy skin due to my eczema this product stops it producing seconds of a burning sensation and feels OK after 5 minutes, leaving the skin soft. I don&#x27;t recommend it for all crisis of eczema because its cause is located in a different department but it alleviates the itching when hydrocortisone cannot do its job.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work to cure athletes foot. The first two ingredients are alcohol and there isn&#x27;t much else in it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I use this product for everything! I use it after I shave my armpits and my bikini area. I use it to heal my mosquito bites, between my toes, on my piercings, and on my cuts. I love it! It smells great and feels good! Buy this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more. Helped clear up my eczema better than medicated petroleum jelly. There is a slight burning tingle but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s really working. Works great for all my skin ailments.</li>
    <li> This product works well on acne and warts but it does take some time to work. Also make sure you use lotion on your face if you use it for acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months now. I don&#x27;t know how I survived without it. I have used it on atheltics feet, Ache, to sunburns. I&#x27;m sure I will find so much more it can be used for. So glad Amazon is selling it now. I can&#x27;t it get where I live. But I got it off the internet before.     A big thank you to the person who invented this, great job.</li>
    <li> I have used toe juice and wherever I put it, it turns my skin bright red.  It looks like sunburn.  It takes a good hour or so for the color to fade. If I use it multiple times it always makes my skin dry up and peel away. I have used it on a bad zit that wouldn&#x27;t go away. I really think it killed the bacteria but it also makes lots of dry flaking skin (thus my skin was renewing itself).  I wouldn&#x27;t use this product daily but for occasional application.  Oh, and it really burns on broken or sensitive skin but the sensation subsides within a few minutes.</li>
    <li> The smell is kinda strong but idgaf, it helped get rid of the itching and flaking between my toes. That happens cuz i walk a lot. I like that it dries quickly and it works on pimples too.</li>
    <li> My hands and my feet get really dry and cracked. A friend suggested I try this Toe Juice stuff (which I thought sounded a bit strange). All I can tell you is that this stuff is amazing. For some reason my skin doesn&#x27;t absorb lotions very well, but Toe Juice soaks into my skin very well. I have been using this product for over a year now and have found it useful for the following things:     - Insect bites  - dry and cracked feet and hands  - Underarm and areas subject to chafing (for a runner - nipples and groin area)   - General itching  - Aftershave (I grow facial hair like a mountain man, shaving is always irritating to my skin)    I would definitely recommend this product, it works really well.     P.S. - on broken skin this stuff doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;tingle\\&quot;, it burns! Once the burn subsides, it feels really good.</li>
    <li> I use this on everything, from feet that get beat up on 8 hours of concrete to bug bites, to hands that get hard working mans cuts, scrapes and general abuse.  To be honest it does sting going on, but haven&#x27;t found anything that touches this when it comes to getting healed up.  Trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed, you got to try this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> i have been using this product off and on for a long timr and it worked on skin problems well. I hadnt tried it for a couple of years and&lt;br /&gt;had a problem on the top of my left ear that looked like sunburn  (red and peeling) which my doctor wanted to peel off . Finally I tried toe juice and in 2 days the 5 year problem was completely gone. What a great result!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son who says of all the products he tried its helped him the best - so I keep on buying it.</li>
    <li> My son has suffered from cracking feet since he was 2.  No dermatologist can come up with a solution.  The description of this sounded like it was worth a try.  I tried this on my sons feet.  He named it Evil Burning Acid, when he stopped screaming in agony.</li>
    <li> Just a over priced astringent. It dries out dry skin takes oil of oily skin.</li>
    <li> This product is great for two reasons: my skin disorder and and helps calms my irritation after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a genetic skin disorder called Ichthyosis Vulgaris, better known is Alligator or Fish Scale disease. I&#x27;ve had it since I was six years old, and for years never knew what this condition was until I ran across a picture on the internet with a leg looking just like mine: scaly, flaky and dry. Immediately I started to look up information the fact the the doctors couldn&#x27;t really help me and were giving me creams for eczema, and I ran into this YouTube video of a young man that used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really thought the name of it was weird, but I thought \\&quot;what the heck...I&#x27;ve tried everything else.\\&quot; The actual website is a lot more expensive so of course I ordered it from Amazon. And immediately I noticed results. The dark scales on my legs began to lighten up after the third day. The reason why I did not buy another bottle because it ran out so quickly. With someone like me, I have to use this over my whole body so this stuff can go fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I am back to trying this again, and again am noticing results. Keep in mind, my skin disorder is NOT CURABLE, and I do not expect it to disappear completely, but after a few days I am seeing good results at keeping the problem under control, and with luck maybe the darker scales on my leg will be light enough to the point where I can be a little more comfortable showing my legs this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that my skin is dryer than most because of my condition, and the fact that this product does have alcohol in it, I make sure I do moisturize after applying the toe juice. That is very important to anybody that uses this product. I noticed that a few reviews stated that they have problems with dry skin after applying, but never mentioned using a lotion or something after this product. Me, I either have to use vaseline mixed with lotion, and at night I just use lotion and I spritz a water based glycerin over my legs and I&#x27;m fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as for shaving, I have ALWAYS had problems with irritation and itchiness after shaving my legs no matter what brand of a cream or razor I use to shave with. For the first time a week ago, I nervously applied this to my legs after shaving in the shower, and the reason why I was nervous because I had a feeling it was going to burn, which it did, but the burning went away quickly after it dried, and calmed my itching down immediately! The second time after shaving my legs which was today, I tried it again, and it did not burn as much as it did the first time, which I was very relieved. There was no itching or irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I am seeing results makes me happy, and I am also pleased the smell isn&#x27;t as strong as it used to be when I first tried it over a year ago. I&#x27;m guessing maybe customers sent suggestions on the strong citrus odor and they fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also changed my diet a little bit. I&#x27;m not a water drinker, which I know is silly because of the skin disorder that I have, but I have increased my intake of water. I&#x27;m a small person so three glasses a day pretty much works for me. That has also helped this product work better and helps hydrate your skin as well. So instead of just putting the product on, remember it is very important to hydrate from the inside as well. I hope this review helps someone, and I will try give another review in a few weeks if my scaly legs have shown more improvement.and I&#x27;m fine.

    <li> This product is great- and we love it! We&#x27;re total converts to Toe Juice. It works very well, helps with a lot of foot issues, and skin issues, and also has a pleasing aroma, dries quickly without any staining or issues, and works great! We&#x27;re big fans :)</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed at all. Didn&#x27;t do anything to soften or enhance skin in any way.</li>
    <li> Should be head to toe juice! Works great on cracked feet, bug bites, rash, razor burn, you name it! I recommend this stuff to everyone!</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 bottles of Toe Juice. I must say that the first bottles ingredients is as the ad stated. The second bottles ingredients are different. They both smell the same but &amp;#34;Willow bark extract&amp;#34; is missing on the second bottles list. Looking at the bottles there are many differences. I went to the Toe Juice website and it&#x27;s the only product they sell. Hope that the second bottle works as well as the first.</li>
    <li> I used to shave only once or twice a week.  If I shaved any more than that, I&#x27;d get a painful rash.  Then I discovered Toe Juice.  I saw how well it worked on my feet and decided to try it as an aftershave.  It works great!  Now I can shave comfortably every day.</li>
    <li> I use Toe Juice on a daily basis. It has been the only thing that can keep the redness of my skin under control and reduce my acne. I have tried everything. I don&#x27;t know how I have lived without it for so long!    I woke up the other morning with terrible spider bites on my feet and immediately ran to my Toe Juice! The itching and pain went away immediately. I would definitely recommend Toe Juice to anyone!     Take advantage of this good deal!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this twice a day, and he loves it! He says it stings a bit, but he feels like its working that way:)</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!!! Although the name can be misleading, it&#x27;s a wonderful multi-use product.  We&#x27;ve been using in our household the past few weeks and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this juice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son has had a wart on his head for months now.  He doesn&#x27;t want to go to the doctor because he knows it is going to hurt where it is located.  I&#x27;ve tried many over-the-counter products, but it doesn&#x27;t work.  We used Toe Juice on it last week and have been putting some on the wart every night before he goes to bed.  It&#x27;s diminishing considerably.  At this rate, it should be completely gone in another week.  He is ecstatic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other uses we have been using Toe Juice for.  My daughter has been using it on her face for acne.  It works fast and her skin is looking luminous.  I&#x27;ve used it on poor, overworked feet and it is so refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I love this product and keep finding new ways we can utilize it in our house.  What we have had several bottles for now, one does the job.  That&#x27;s economical and that&#x27;s fantastic! I highly recommend this product - give it a try! It might be the answer you&#x27;ve been looking for!!</li>
    <li> Super fast service.  I would trust this company and buy from them again.  The product seems to be high in alcohol, although I haven&#x27;t verified that, but seems to do the trick.  Will purchase from again when needed.  The product is fluid, not gel or lotion, so a little hard to apply, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> MY PROBLEM: LOSING MY SKIN:  very scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about two years, the skin on my hands, arms and feet has been thinning out, breaking open, bleeding, then healing into scared areas. It was gross, scary and sent me rushing to the doctor to find the cause. I have been given various creams to thicken and stregthen the cell base of my skin and that has helped some, but now it is winter which brings dry air in my area and it has increased my problem. Ugly skin flakes everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just visited with my local pharmacist at my favorite Huge Chain Drugstore to see if she had any ideas for over the counter products and her advice was that I should go back to my doctor. I grumbled away and went over to the Cosmetics area where a friend of mine works so that she could check me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was ringing up my purchases when I happened to see TOE JUICE. I idly looked at the Directions For Use labed on this odd sounding product and found that it was touted to be for skin problems: you could wipe it or POUR it on. Since my body covering was slowly peeling away and I had visions of my anatomy book showing a muscelized body with no skin dancing in my head, I decided it was certainly worth a shot. I had my friend/cash register operator add it to my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home I began to wipe it on. Pouring it seemed a bit outrageous because of the price. My arms, legs, and feet were covered with dry, scaly skin. UGH. Two coats of the Toe Juice and my arms and legs looked normal. I was estatic. But, I wondered, what would I look like the next day? Well, I looked the same. A ilittle scaling had started to appear on my hands, but I put another wipe of Toe Juice on and all was well.&lt;br /&gt;On the third day, I was just fine also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the nitty gritty of it. When I put on my first application of Toe Juice, huge amounts of black dead skin, laden with lotion solutions rolled off. Once that was gone, I put on another application, and there was no dry, scaly skin showing. Then I showered. Dry skin again. Another application required. And, so far, I need it every time I shower, but the need is less and less. More skin appears healthy and pink. To me, it is just incredible. I am getting a healthy outer layer back. I was to the point that I was really scared that my skin would flake away and I would die for lack of an exterior coating! Beware though, if you have a problem similar to mine, getting off all the old lotioned skin is a gross exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few open areas and the product does BURN, not tingle when it hits an open site. It is a splasy liquid. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it takes very little product to cover a large area. I used about an eighth of a large bottle (4.6 oz) to cover my arms, legs and hands. The price on Amazon is quite a bit lower than that of the Huge Chain Drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cracking areas on the feet (not open), it has taken me four days to erase those. Previously, I have found nothing that has gotten rid of them. Some products soften and cover them, but do not get rid of them. This does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really thankful for, and happy with this product. I would jump up and down and scream that it was a miracle, but I have yet to use it long term. But, for me, it has definitely been a short term miracle.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for anyone with skin problems. Why not? It might work. It certainly has for me! Hope it works as well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEPTEMBER 3, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE FOUND ANOTHER SOLUTION ON AMAZON WHICH WORKS ALL OVER THE BODY:  SOLD SEPARATELT OR IN COMBINATION : SULFER SOAP, SULFUR OINTMENT,SALICYLIC (ASAPIRIN SOAP).[[ASIN:B00DSOI73W 2 Pack - Premium 10% Sulfur Soap Cleansing Bar]][[ASIN:B00D8HPO8K 4 Pack - Sulfur Butter Creme &#x27;N Ointment]][[ASIN:B00JBCLQWE SAL3 Sulfur Soap - 10% Sulphur, 3% Salicylic Acid Skin Care + Sulfur Cream &#x27;n Ointment]]MY DOC SAID I HAD EXTREMELY DRY SKIN AND SUGGESTED FEWER SHOWERS, AND COVERING MY ENTIRE BODY IN LOTION 2 TIMES A DAY.

    <li> Love TOE JUICE! My family has been using it for about 2 years, it has cleared up acne &amp; stopped the itch of mosquito bites, in fact I don&#x27;t know what you can&#x27;t use TOE JUICE on!</li>
    <li> Not just good for athletes foot.  Works on other skin issues too.  I use it on dry spots and rough patches also.</li>
    <li> My wife is the primary user of the Toe Juice.  She loves the product.  She uses it for various skin problems, such as bug bites and scrapes, too relieve the pain, and to reduce the marks made on her skin.  She also uses it on flacking skin.</li>
    <li> Most people have probably never heard of this product.  However, it is one of the few products I purchase every month.  My wife uses it for her heels.  I use it every day after I shower in certain places.  My son, takes it from me all the time.  He likes to use it for pimples.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but I can tell you it is one of the most popular products in our bathroom.  The thing I really like is that it does not put oils or greasy thing on your skin.  When I rub it of my feet, it evaporates.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother after seeing it on The Blaze because she said her  feet get dry and cracked and burn to the point where they keep her up at night, After just one use her feet started to get softer, the cracks went away after a couple uses and the burning went away immediately, Now my mother uses it every night on her feet and she doesn&#x27;t have any problems with them unless she runs out of Toe Juice</li>
    <li> November 28, 2014  It may be because the warts are less noticeable but I&#x27;ve ordered another bottle and this new bottle has a different formula. Here is the current formulation:   Isopropyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat, Water/Aqua, Salicylic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Camphor, Blue 1 (C| 42090), Yellow 5 (C| 19140), Limonene, Linalool.    The previous formulation reads thus:  Isopropyl alcohol, SD alcohol 40-B, willow bark extract, phenylformic acid, blue 1, citrus medica limonum oil (lemon peel oil), formosa, fragrance, yellow 5.    If this new formulation doesn&#x27;t work then it&#x27;s time to give up on this product.      January 17, 2014  It didn&#x27;t do anything other than dry out my skin, the first time I rubbed it on. I tried to use it for my mosaic flat warts and it did nothing, at first. I tried to use it on the dry skin on my feet and nothing happened. It stung and smelled very strongly like rubbing alcohol and I know I could get rubbing alcohol from anywhere.    I kept using it on my warts everyday for weeks because I was desperate to get rid of the warts - and this product. It started rubbing off the warts in layers, bit by bit. Right now the small mosaic flat warts have rubbed off and haven&#x27;t returned. The larger warts have been worn down to the skin and are less noticeable. It&#x27;s been months. I call it progress as long as none of the warts are noticeable. Hopefully, if I keep going this product will work and all the warts will be gone.</li>
    <li> My baby got a case of skin psoriasis.  We tried coco butter, nothin&#x27; doin&#x27;.  We put the Toe Juice on first then followed with the coco butter and it didn&#x27;t just reduce the condition it cured it and we&#x27;ve stopped applying it.  They should change the name to miracle juice.</li>
    <li> It really did smooth out the rough skin on my feet.</li>
    <li> A friend of our niece gave us some of this as a gift (his dad invented it). It is amazing!</li>
    <li> Purchased it for my dad&#x27;s phorisis to see if it would help. Says it took the itch away a little but so far not reducing the inflammation</li>
    <li> I am really hoping this will get rid of the planters warts I have had for 4 years but so far there is no change. I have used this product multiple times a day for a week and I am still waiting for results. The smell is super strong and is very similar to nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> It does burn at first, but it says that the burn means it is working.  It has really helped our skin issues around here like contact dermatitis and my daughter&#x27;s eczema!</li>
    <li> Since discovering this more than two years ago we have used it nearly daily.  Great product for lots of skin issues.</li>
    <li> This stuff work very well.  It cleared up the problem quickly.</li>
    <li> Burns on open areas, but works fast. Good on many areas besides your toes. Works well as an after shave.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this product enough stars..I have athletes foot, nothing would clear it up..Including prescriptions from the Dr. I have been trying different things for years! Then I  found Toe Juice, and within 2 days foot is all clear..A miracle, no sign of athletes foot! I just use it now once a month for maintenance.</li>
    <li> This stuff is kind of remarkable.  Put it on your feet instead of lotion and over a course of a few days, your feet will be softer and smoother, because this is essentially an exfoliator.  But, it&#x27;s not overly drying or stinky or anything like that.  Can also be used on ingrown hairs and whatever skin ailment you have, it seems like.  Very versatile.  Very unique.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I&#x27;ve used it on my kids&#x27; eczema and it cleared it up within 2 weeks!  I also used it on my heels and it smoothed them out beautifully.  Definitely a product I will keep in my house.</li>
    <li> Simply cannot believe that this little bottle of liquid works so quickly to heal the cracks in my overly dry feet.  My severe cracks (I live barefoot or in flip flops), which had been somewhat neglected while my feet were covered for cooler weather- immediately split open and became painful as soon as sandal weather arrived.  I felt the improvement after the very first application (I did follow my toe juice application up with b&amp;bw body butter)  and by the second use the difference was visible.  Am soooo grateful to have stumbled upon this product online and will not be without it in my home ever again.  Everyone should own some!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I had never heard of this until a couple of weeks ago when a co-worker who was leaving at the time was getting rid of a few things and asked me if I wanted a bottle of this &amp;#34;Toe Juice&amp;#34;. I have to say, I didn&#x27;t think this watery &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; would do anything but I was wrong. It works pretty damn good on my usually dry hands. I went and ordered 4 bottles so I could turn my family on to the &amp;#34;Toe Juice&amp;#34; wonder. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have quit using the expensive steroid cream that my dermatologist prescribed me for the eczema on my hand. After using this for just a few weeks I noticed that my hand was softer and smoother. After a month it is almost completely gone and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This is a crazy name for something that is fairly versatile. I don&#x27;t know exactly how the ingredients work to accomplish a variety of things (wart removal is one I can think of) but it seems to work for me. It takes a little while, but warts can be tough to irradicate! Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes of helping my eczema based on the reviews, but when I received the product the first two ingredients are alcohol! That will dry out and further irritate my eczema! Eczema is a dry skin irritation for all who are wondering, and alcohol drys your skin out. I would stay away from this if you have eczema.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever for skin</li>
    <li> Great for keeping foot odor to a minimum.  He&#x27;s tried many products without success.  I will keep this around at all times.  I&#x27;m the winner here!</li>
