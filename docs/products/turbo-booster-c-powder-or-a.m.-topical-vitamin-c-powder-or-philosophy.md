      <li>I stuff smells good</li>

      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>I, promise, you will LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!  </li>
      <li>I know the temptation to use more, but don&#x27;t do it!</li>
      <li>It sounds much more labor-intensive than it is (I promise!).</li>
      <li>I just love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This powder makes the skin bright and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like the results are as amazing as they were when I used it before either.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is absolutely the BEST!</li>
      <li>but I kind of can&#x27;t wait to be done with it.</li>
      <li>I messed up my self tanner&#x27; kind of orange tinge on my hands.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lately, I&#x27;ve found myself loving Philosophy&#x27;s products, and I use a number of them.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say I don&#x27;t see any changes.</li>
      <li>but this powder goes on nice with the lotion...</li>
      <li>Also it very easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the one who love to try make up things, and I have to say this one is SOOO AMAZING.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin that you&#x27;re pretty happy with, this product may not be the best investment.</li>
      <li>It mixes well with my favorite olay moisturizer and alittle</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lasting me forever, and it works great!</li>
      <li>The combination of Philosophy&#x27;s Micro Delivery Scrub wash and the Turbo Booster C Powder in the AM and Miracle Worker Spot Remover and M.W. Retinol Pads at bedtime has made a real difference in my skin, and with the great prices on Amazon it is about $62/month.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>it is the most available-usable-to-skin Vit.</li>
      <li>I love this combo-</li>
      <li>Do not add more than the suggested, leveled scoop.</li>
      <li>I love having that barrier on my skin with this antioxidant powder.</li>
      <li>I have used Philosophy Turbo Booster C for a couple of years and I love it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Every anti-aging regimen I&#x27;ve tried either caused me to break out more, or in the case of retinol products caused a burn-like reaction.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is probably better for normal/dry skin tones.</li>
      <li>I love the ease &amp; versatility of it.</li>
      <li>You can use it alone or mixed with your favorite water-based serum, moisturizer or spf,  Vitamin c powder helps protect skin against environmental attack and brighten skin tone, it has been proven by dermatologist to be one of the best things to fight the signs of aging, along with retinoids and spf.  </li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>It somehow manages to make your face look and feel much more healthy.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a cute bottle</li>
      <li>love this company, and I love it&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 months, and my skin has never been better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love this...</li>
      <li>This is such a great product!!</li>
      <li>It also brightens my skin, giving me a more youthful glow.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
      <li>I look  forward to seeing how it improves my skin in regard to wrinkles :)</li>
      <li>i love this product, so far so good!</li>
      <li>Not considering this issue, I really like it because I feel smooth and bright on my face!</li>
      <li>so Id say its pretty good..</li>
      <li>At the time of using this product my skin was in pretty good shape..</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>Because of this the vitamin c stays more stable and effective and keeping skin fresh and youthful.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it really does help give a nice glow to my face</li>
      <li>You can also control the amount you want in your mixture which is great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>(This does not apply as much to serums, but the result here can be surprisingly gritty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So cool!</li>
      <li>After researching vitamin C, I realized that it oxidizes really easily</li>
      <li>Easy to use too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it has brightened my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Saw a difference after 2 weeks of consistent use--radiant glow. I just mix about 1/2 scoop into my morning facial cream (not at night--I use a different night serum) and it blends it easily. Sometimes stings just a tiny bit--b/c it is acidic, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. The C boost has reduced breakouts and I see a glow...and dare I say, my wrinkles are less noticeable! Love it! $39 at Nordstrom, on Amazon, way cheaper (sometimes as low as $8 or $9 cheaper for same product). A little goes a long way and use with your favorite daily facial cream. I will definitely keep on using this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just great.  It somehow manages to make your face look and feel much more healthy.  I love this product even though it is pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> I just bought my second bottle of this powder....I like it and like the routine of mixing it into my moisturizer every morning. My skin has definitely improved in the last three months (2 1/2 months is about how long this product lasts with a daily spoonful -- not too bad) since I&#x27;ve been using this product, however there have been a number of other factors involved so I don&#x27;t know how much I can specifically credit the Booster C. When it comes down to it though, I like using this product, especially during the summer, because of the known advantages of using potent vitamin C as a preventative measure against sun damage. Even though I don&#x27;t know how specifically transformative this product has been for my skin, I will probably keep buying it as an anti-aging investment for the future of my skin.</li>
    <li> Used daily for two weeks, couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.</li>
    <li> This powder allows for vitamin c to be mixed into your choice of moisturizer daily. Because of this the vitamin c stays more stable and effective and keeping skin fresh and youthful.</li>
    <li> I gave five stars becuase this booster c powder  really works.  It protects against sunburns and the effect of windy days. It mixes well with my favorite olay moisturizer and alittle goes a long way.  I wish the bottle was a little bigger.  Its alittle pricey but its worth it.</li>
    <li> Just mix it with your regular face cream or serum.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it has brightened my skin. I like it very much. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Title says it all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a staple in my skincare routine.  I mix with Hope in a Tube SPF.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s potentcy is higher than liquid Vit. C products and it costs a lot less.  The powder formula is stable, so it doesn&#x27;t go bad/lose potentcy like a liquid.  I mix mine with my sunscreen.</li>
    <li> wonderful product to mix with moisturizer. will def. buy again</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product, but I have found that I prefer a serum type Vitamin C that also includes the Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E.  It is more convenient to use than the idea of using the tiny scoop provided in this bottle and mixing the powder with a cream or sunscreen to go on your face, plus this burns sometimes.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and I love it!  I use it with the Hope in a Jar moisturizer and it evens out the tone.  I have used this product for a long while and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I used to use their vitamin C powder before when it was called something else and for the life of me I can&#x27;t remember what the name was. I didn&#x27;t use it for a couple of years and decided I wanted to try it again. I was a bit disappointed with the reformulation of this. It makes everything I mix it with turn instantly watery. The one I had before never did this, I could mix with my moisturizer and it would still be creamy. I mix this and it turns it into a water that is harder to apply to my face. I don&#x27;t feel like the results are as amazing as they were when I used it before either.  My skin used to glow with this but I don&#x27;t see much difference with the new formula. I do like it and have been using it for about 3 months, not sure if I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I noticed some wrinkles in my cheeks.  Since I started to use this product I feel that my skin has become a little firmer and the wrinkles perhaps not as deep.  I just started using this product last month.  So far I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is the first skin care product that made a difference for me. First product ever. I have 35 years old, dehydrated, normal to dry skin. Although I don&#x27;t have any discoloration, my &amp;#34;nothing special&amp;#34; and a little dull light skin is now really bright. I mix this with my moisturizer, CeraVe cream or St Ives collagen elastin. This tiny bottle makes me want to try more stuff, stem cell creams, when hope is not enough serum, and the whole Philosophy line including the cleanser. The price is unbeatable too, only $27 on Amazon. Just give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering and using this turbo Booster Vitamin C powder with my face lotion for the past 4-5 years, great product.  This will always be a big part of my facial routine.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this at Sephora, but decided to add it into my free shipping box. This is such a great product!! Since it stays a powder until you mix it into whatever liquid of preference, it remains stable &amp; holds its original potency. I love the ease &amp; versatility of it. Most, I love the results!!</li>
    <li> I have used Philosophy Turbo Booster C for a couple of years and I love it. You can add it to any cream you might be using to make a powerful anti-oxidant skin cream. Yo can mix in as much or as little as you like and it stays stronger and fresher this way. This powder makes the skin bright and healthy looking. Really, this is one of those beauty products that is basic and simple and necessary. It is like a hybrid medi/cosmetic. It heals and fixes and beautifies the skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> my skin has changed since I started using this during the day... It prevents dark spots from forming and my skins texture is smoother.  Around the same time I started using this I also started using Bauer bepanthanol and between the 2, my skin has changed.</li>
    <li> Philosophy turbo booster c is a 99.8% high potency topical vitamin c powder. You can use it alone or mixed with your favorite water-based serum, moisturizer or spf,  Vitamin c powder helps protect skin against environmental attack and brighten skin tone, it has been proven by dermatologist to be one of the best things to fight the signs of aging, along with retinoids and spf.  I like to use this with my Hope is not enough serum...I&#x27;m in love.  Boy does this little bottle last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the one who love to try make up things, and I have to say this one is SOOO AMAZING. Mix it like half spoon( the one it give it to you) with toner, guess what? My face not oil all day and shine! If I put make up on, my skin is just like a baby!</li>
    <li> It really contains lots of Vitamin C because every time I use it, I have to mix the powder with lots of toner (around half of my palm), or I will feel burn.  Not considering this issue, I really like it because I feel smooth and bright on my face!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, but I suggest you not buy it from Amazon. When I bought it from a reputable beauty supplier,  it was the real thing. When I ordered it here, I don&#x27;t know what I got. It&#x27;s a white powder, but it doesn&#x27;t oxidize &amp; turn dark when exposed to air like Vitamin C does. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Certainly, this product truly does brighten skin (and provides added sun-protection). I have used it for years ... and LOVED it for years! However, there is serious learning-curve with this product. After two years of trial and error, I can offer the following advice (and please feel free to comment if you have discovered other \\&quot;tricks\\&quot; to make this product particularly effective):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) One complaint I have noticed is that it stains one&#x27;s fingernails and palms a orange/tan color. I can personally confirm that this can occur. For me, it turned the tips of my fingernails an orange/brown color ... just on the sides, under the nail. Likewise, it did turn the lines of my palm orange/brown (probably for the same reason). I loved the results of this product so much that I simply began experimenting with ways to avoid this. Ultimately, I found success by first placing a thick moisturizer in my palm and creating a little \\&quot;pond.\\&quot; Then, I add a correctly measured scoop of Turbo Booster C into that \\&quot;pond.\\&quot; I then fold my hand repeatedly over the product before touching it with my other hand (just to get it a bit more mixed without touching the skin of either hand). Then, I mix it with my fingers. It sounds much more labor-intensive than it is (I promise!). Since I have begun doing this, I no longer have stains on my hands or fingernails. (If I used it with my serums, it stained. They are too thin. If I put the Turbo Booster C in my palm first, it REALLY REALLY stained). It should be noted that I am uber pale, so any discoloration is super obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Do not add more than the suggested, leveled scoop. By adding more to a moisturizer or sunscreen, the result can be a dry, white streaky effect. I know the temptation to use more, but don&#x27;t do it! (This does not apply as much to serums, but the result here can be surprisingly gritty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) The instructions note not to add Turbo Booster C directly to a container of moisturizer. Why? Once mixed, it begins to lose it efficacy. Therefore, mix it fresh each time. (There is no point in investing in this product otherwise. So, don&#x27;t take a short-cut.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) If you use an exfoliating agent such as [[ASIN:B003E8CJWM Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash]] and follow that with this product, you may experience a stinging sensation. It will quickly pass. I have even experienced this sensation after cleansing with my [[ASIN:B004I5RU2Y Clarisonic PLUS Sonic]] ... but, no worries, it completely harmless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) Yes, it can make your hands smell (very faintly) odd. To avoid this, you can wash your hands after mixing the product. However, I elect to mix just a little extra Turbo Booster C and actually rub it on the back of my hands (where aging is often first visibly detected). The barely noticeable, weird smell (after it dries) does not bother me a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those products that (initially) can be (VERY) frustrating. Between the staining, stinging, and white streaks, it seems strange that so many people here highly endorse it. Nonetheless, you should also view that as evidence of this product&#x27;s potential. Yep, it is troublesome (and, I still get it wrong on occasion) ... but it really does work! Be patient ... I, promise, you will LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This has faded my acne scars and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. After researching vitamin C, I realized that it oxidizes really easily so i only wanted to spend money on something that I knew would be stable. Also it very easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> Very easy to mix in with my moisturizer and results are apparent immediately. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I can&#x27;t imagine going without. Really makes my skin look radiant.</li>
    <li> This is great for the price. I use it at night so it can really work while I sleep counteracting the stresses of the day.</li>
    <li> I am 41 and in the past couple of years I&#x27;ve begun to get brown spots around my eyes and hairline from the sun. I also have dark spots from old acne scars. Oddly enough, I never had acne as a teen but I&#x27;ve always had oily skin, and for some reason as an adult I began getting painful cyst-like acne around my chin. Every anti-aging regimen I&#x27;ve tried either caused me to break out more, or in the case of retinol products caused a burn-like reaction. I&#x27;ve used department store luxury brands, boutique brands and drug store bargain brands, and nothing worked. I decided to try Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker nighttime retinol pads after reading great reviews of its mildness and efficacy on another website. Not only did I not have any reaction to the retinol, but my face began glowing. I added Philosophy&#x27;s dark spot remover at night after the retinol pads, but wanted something for daytime. The night pads make my skin feel oily (although I don&#x27;t break out), so I was reluctant to try the Miracle Worker AM pads and feel like an oil slick all day long. I spotted the Turbo Booster C Powder and decided to give it a try in the AM, mixing it with a light gel moisturizer from Olay. I love this combo- the powder seems to really control the oil in my skin and it has made my skin so soft! I am noticing that my freckles and scars are lightening, and my skin is even brighter. The combination of Philosophy&#x27;s Micro Delivery Scrub wash and the Turbo Booster C Powder in the AM and Miracle Worker Spot Remover and M.W. Retinol Pads at bedtime has made a real difference in my skin, and with the great prices on Amazon it is about $62/month. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Very nice! just use few days already can feel skin more much better! So cool!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 40 and have been using this for close to 10 years. I add it to a hyaluronic serum and my skin still has the same texture as when I was 30. It really rejuvenates the skin daily, making it smoother and fresh looking, not dull.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine doing my skincare routine in the morning WITHOUT using this powder.  I love having that barrier on my skin with this antioxidant powder.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 3 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin but will continue to use it. Does not sting or smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second bottle. A great product!</li>
    <li> She mixes it with her other lotion stuff and it lasts a long time... it makes her happy so Id say its pretty good..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s. I have oily/combination skin. I&#x27;m acne prone. At the time of using this product my skin was in pretty good shape..I was looking for preventative measures for aging/even out skin tone. I added this to my regimen for about 4-5 days. I had serious breakouts and within a couple hours of applying this my face had a HUGE amount of oil. This caused a lot of breakouts and an extreme amount of excess oil on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably better for normal/dry skin tones. If you&#x27;re acne prone--I&#x27;d stay clear of this, it took awhile for my face to adjust back from this product. It produced A LOT of acne. I returned it to Amazon (great customer service, thank you).</li>
    <li> this product is perfect for me.i am falling love with it since i use it and this is the third bottle.</li>
    <li> saves you ton of money by mixing it into your night cream</li>
    <li> My face is bright and fresher than ever. I&#x27;ve even stopped wearing foundation. This will now be a part of my regular routine</li>
    <li> I love that I can make vitamin C fresh everyday!  Second time buying and I will continue to purchase as I have tried others.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my lotion every other day.  I can feel it tingling and overall feel like it makes me feel like my skin is just a little bit brighter.</li>
    <li> Sticky when mixed with mosturizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely the BEST! I love that you can addd it to pretty much any liquid (make up, moisturizer, whatever) and it will do the work for you.  It has helped to reduce the redness in my skin from past breakouts and leaves my skin glowing and healthy.  I LOVE this product!!!</li>
    <li> The bottle last forever.</li>
    <li> I love adding a little vitamin C to my moisturizers and foundation.</li>
    <li> I like it so much. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good product that you mix with your moisturizer in the morning.  Makes your skin tone bright and clear.  Will buy again,</li>
    <li> I was advised by my dermatologist to use a vitamin c serum.  She mentioned that Philosophy had a good one.  I figured that the powder would last longer and decided to give it a whirl.  My skin was brighter, clearer, and fresher looking after the very first time I used it.  It has been about three weeks of once a day use now and my skin continues to look and feel great.  I had twins six months ago and still have some melasma on my face, but it seems to be fading faster since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product so far but having issues mixing it with my moisturizer. Any pointers out there?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months. What I like about this product is that you can mix it with any moisturizer (even the inexpensive) and it still gives you great results. It reduces blotches and dark spots and smooths the texture of your skin. You can also control the amount you want in your mixture which is great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I actually mix this with my primer and it&#x27;s perfect. I have oily skin, and though I really wanted to use a serum or moisturizer for the anti-aging benefits, I couldn&#x27;t ever find one that didn&#x27;t leave me greasy. Mixing this powder with my primer turned out to be the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also read that Vitamin C is one of the best anti-agers, but that it&#x27;s unstable in lotions and creams. So at least with this powder, I feel like I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 months, and my skin has never been better.</li>
    <li> Some years ago I studied and tried to understand about skin care products and what was hype and what was worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not appreciated enough.  IMHO it is the most available-usable-to-skin Vit. C that one can get.  It seemed to me that nothing else I used that was Vit. C had the same effect on my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a dry powder that comes with a little teeny plastic spoon.  Just add it to something, moisturizer with sunscreen, tinted moisturizer, you can try different things. Blend it in your palm and try to make it all mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you couldn&#x27;t mix it really well, and you see some teeny little white clumps of it, just brush them off with your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering after not using it for a long time how long it would be to show effects...  That DAY I had people complimenting me on my skin, without my telling them about this at all.  That&#x27;s fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reviewer who didn&#x27;t like it much and used it at night?  Just wanted to say, again IMHO!, that I think you should try it  during the day, not at night;  it seems that a little bit of sunshine helps the product really work; still wear sunscreen, you don&#x27;t need to sit outside or change your routine, just a bit of sun will help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle may look small, but it takes a long, long time to use it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like products are going by the wayside; I would like it if this product never gets discontinued!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to all of you reviewers for all the great advice and time you have spent sharing so that we don&#x27;t waste as much money as we probably would without you!</li>
    <li> I am suing it and do like it.  Not sure if it is really working.  Tho a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while&lt;br /&gt;told me I looked good...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different about my skin. At first, it seemed to leave a softening layer or film on my skin, which was kinda nice, now I don&#x27;t notice it anymore. I haven&#x27;t noticed reduction in brown spots, which is what I had been hoping for, but I guess I will wait until I&#x27;ve finished the bottle before I decide whether it was a waste or not.  I can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s just another unnecessary product that I&#x27;ve been duped into buying...</li>
    <li> As a 48 year old male, I sometimes look at myself in the mirror and think &#x27;where did those stunning looks of yore go?&#x27; Well, OK, maybe not stunning, but OK on a good day, in the right light. I was pretty late in life starting a proper skin-care regime (cause guys don&#x27;t do that, right?), and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good products that might help.&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I&#x27;ve found myself loving Philosophy&#x27;s products, and I use a number of them. No, they are not &#x27;miracle cures&#x27;, but darn, they do help. Now this stuff, which I&#x27;ve been using for a month, is the real deal. You mix a little of it with your chosen moisturizer, and slather it on your skin. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it really does help give a nice glow to my face and yes, people have remarked on it (only girls, cause guys don&#x27;t do that, right?). I mix it with the same companies &#x27;Time in a Bottle&#x27;, which I also highly recommend. I&#x27;m keeping this, and will keep on using it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little spendy, yes, but it comes with a little tiny spoon to measure it out, and I&#x27;m guessing it will last quite a few months.&lt;br /&gt;I love this company, and I love it&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Great product, seems to have stopped the wrinkles from getting bigger on my forehead.  It also brightens my skin, giving me a more youthful glow.  I mix it with the Philosophy oil free SPF moisturizer in the morning.  It&#x27;s been part of my daily routine for the last year.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of serums and have had issues with my face getting too shiny from them, with the turbo booster c powder I don&#x27;t experience this.</li>
    <li> After 4 months of nightly use I feel I&#x27;ve given this product a fair assessment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is neat- but for the trouble of storing it and using the stupid tiny (albeit adorable) spoon thing and mixing it and trying not to get it all over your bathroom.....I&#x27;m really not seeing the results to make it worth it. For the price, I am determined to finish up the bottle and get my $$$ worth.....but I kind of can&#x27;t wait to be done with it. Every morning I am trying to spoon out the right amount (honestly it&#x27;s next to impossible with the stupid little spoon shovel thing it comes with) and carefully mix it all into my moisturizer without spilling it all over the place. Also I learned early on that if I don&#x27;t wash it off my hands it leaves this weird &#x27;I messed up my self tanner&#x27; kind of orange tinge on my hands. Super cute. So after rubbing it all over my face I then have to wash my hands off really well- which makes them all slimy from the moisturizer and water mixing together......ughhhh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway like I said- it&#x27;s a cute bottle and I wanted to like it, but I will definitely not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I think it is worth the money. In fact, I would even pay twice the price for this! very good!!</li>
    <li> I just bought this vit c powder and I have to say in just 2 weeks a scar I had on my neck and chest from an old bug bite and burn tht i have had for about a year is starting  to show signs of fading. I can&#x27;t believe it, it really works to improve skin. I look  forward to seeing how it improves my skin in regard to wrinkles :)</li>
    <li> got very sensitiv skin but this powder goes on nice with the lotion...like the way it makes me glow!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Great source of vitamin C application to my face. When mix with my daily moisturizer, it thickens and give my skin even better coverage. IT is $10 cheaper to buy it from Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> I like this product, my skin appear a little brighter but it did nothing for the brown spot on my cheek, wanted to purchase again but the price went up.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this...it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> Broke out a lot after first use. Tried it again a month later and had the same issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before &amp; got great results such as radiant skin texture. Lasted about two(2) months. Easy to use too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 5 months. It works great. I usually mix it with my moisturiser and 2 drops of hyaluronic acid. The reason I give 4 stars is it is hard to handle (especially in the busy morning!)</li>
    <li> This turbo booster c powder was great! It could be a little intense, leaving your skin a little red for those with sensitive skin, but I felt like it was actually doing something. I had some blemishes and this helped clear those up right away. My skin just seemed more fresh. I was happy and would recommend this again!</li>
    <li> This is amazing and i am definitely repurchasing! I mix this with my serum and put my moisturizer over it and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have loved every Philosophy product I&#x27;ve ever tried; they are basically the only ones that work without irritating my sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin.  I use When Hope is Not Enough serum, Hope in a Jar moisturizer and Help Me topical retinol treatment every day, and the regimen has done amazing things for my skin.  Based on the rave reviews for this product, I purchased with high hopes and used a couple of times mixed with Hope in a Jar.  Unfortunately, it stung on application and caused some lingering sensitivity/irritation.  Given that my skin is already pretty good, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth pushing past the initial week of discomfort to see what this product could really do.  If you have sensitive skin that you&#x27;re pretty happy with, this product may not be the best investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last couple weeks and I can honestly say I don&#x27;t see any changes. I stuff smells good and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with mixing it in my moisturizer. Some other reviews claims it stains your hand and clumps but I didn&#x27;t have that issue. It did sting a little after every  use. Again, not sure I saw any changes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!  Cut back on eating sugar &amp; use this product with your moisturizer &amp; watch your face glow!  Texture will improve within a few days...excellent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work for me, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t. I have acne-prone skin. My skin was getting clear except for a few acne dark spots. I decided to try this, and it make me break out like crazy. If you do seem to breakout a lot when using new products or have acne prone skin, I suggest instead of using the whole little spoon you try half the little spoon or less and slowly introduce it to your skin to not breakout &amp; instead of every day try it once a week or every other day to avoid breaking out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a faulty batch, but the powder had a strange smell and would leave an orange-ish tint on my hands and face.  I used as directed so I don&#x27;t know what went wrong.  I ended up returning the product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff that goes a long way. I scoop out a small amount and mix with my moisturizer that I apply in the morning. I usually put a little (a pinch worth) into the palm of my hand, then I add my tinted moisturizer and mix with a brush I use to apply moisturizer. I have been doing this for a few months and I notice my skin doesn&#x27;t have a dull appearance and looks brighter.</li>
    <li> I have been using Philosophy products for years, I Love it!!! But this is the 1st time I have ever used Philosophy Turbo Booster C Powder...I have been using it for 3 days and I see a different already...</li>
    <li> i love this product, so far so good!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It makes such a huge difference with my skin. Mix it with a \\&quot;C\\&quot; serum &amp; get much more radiant skin!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a week ago used one day a week ago then went a few days without it, applied last night and I can see my freckles fading ALOT! This really works, if freckles are an issue or have been an issue, like they have for me my whole life, I thought $30 is money well spent to change something you&#x27;re self conscious about. Thanks so much!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Booster C by Philosophy for a few years.  I mix it in my sunscreen every morning.  The results are great.  I don&#x27;t have one brown spot on my face. This product gives your skin a glow.  I always use the leftovers to put on the back of my hands--you would never know my hands belong to a 71 yr old woman.  Thank you Philosophy for this wonderful product!!!!</li>
    <li> I did see it make some difference in my skin, but after about a week of using it I got very sore, red, flaking areas on my face. So I had to stop using it, which I was sad about. Did anyone else get this reaction?</li>
    <li> The best Vitamin C I have come across. I can already see a difference in my skin and how even tone it is and it&#x27;s soft and my skin feels firm and it keeps my breakouts to a minimum! I just love it!</li>
    <li> This C Booster Powder does the job!</li>
    <li> love this product. keeps skin clear without dryness.</li>
    <li> I used it and my skin feels fresh! My mom keeps using it and she looks younger! I will buy it again for her!</li>
    <li> I used to pay hundreds of dollars for special day and night freaks and I never got the results that using this turbo booster c powder in Aveeno ultra calming lotion has given me. I suffered from horrible adult onset acne (never had a problem with zits at all until I turned 28, than my face exploded and I still don&#x27;t know exactly why). I have been using this powder for about 4 months, I use it in the morning and at night and it has really helped with my over-all skin tone and texture, it has reduced the dark spots and some of the lighter scarring on my cheeks and jawline. I&#x27;m going to continue using this product for a long time!</li>
    <li> Great product, u can feel it working.  Seems to be as effective as higher priced serums.  My aesthetician doesn&#x27;t seem to know I stopped using her product for this.  It can be hard to manage usage.  Spoon often breaks, hard to get out of spoon...fling it out but then splatters or spoon breaks.  I continue to use every day.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s lasting me forever, and it works great!</li>
    <li> broke me out straight away :(</li>
    <li> It is really good for whitening. Even though I feel little dry after I use it with my emulsion, I think it works to protect your skin!</li>
    <li> I used this everyday for six weeks ans saw no change in age spots.  I added one scoop per day to my serum before moisturizer.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I use for 3 years already. Highly recommend. I apply it by mixing with a day cream and I feel the effect immediately.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far to clear up discoloration and acne scars! Start off using just a little bit in the morning with lotion and work your way up to a full scoop - it will do your skin wonders!!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of dark freckles and this product has lightened my skin beautifully. I used to use Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker system to correct dark spots and frankly, this powder is significantly easier than applying retinol and the gooey serum. I mix it with my SPF 50 moisturizer and in just over 2 weeks my skin is noticeably lighter and even. The other thing I&#x27;ve noticed with this powder is that my lines seem less deep and my skin feels softer. I only use 1/2 a spoonful due to the fact that using the full dose stings.</li>
    <li> I just got it 3 days ago, and i like them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on for a couple of years.  I try other things but always go back to using booster C powder.  I read somethere that powder is best to use, and it&#x27;s very easy to mix with a little lotion and comes with a small spoon about the size of a pea.</li>
    <li> We all know how good vit. C is for the skin but with most products made with vit C in it, in a short time you will notice the Vit C will start to oxidize in the lotion and start to turn it orange. With this product you can apply this to the lotion that you put in your hand just before you apply it to your body. You get a fresh dose of vit C to your skin each time. Yes you do have to mix it in your palm with your fingers but a small price to pay for the benefits to the skin. I have noticed some firming and toneing effects to the skin on my legs, arms and hands. Improved texture as well.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous it can be used with any citrus-based serum, it dissolves quickly and boosts the vitamin C content of any serum.</li>
    <li> I only started using this 3 days ago so it&#x27;s too soon to really give an opinion. I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks. I can say this, though, a friend is who told me about this and she absolutely loves it, says it makes her skin clear and gets rid of scars, so we&#x27;ll see....</li>
