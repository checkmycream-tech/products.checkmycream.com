      <li>/&gt;Update: Found a deal on some good programs here -  www.buttgoals.com - if anybody is interested.  </li>
      <li>I dislike the mint sensation when you first put it on, but it does smell good.</li>

      <li>&amp; I love the fact that it&#x27;s a hormonal free product.</li>

      <li>you can see how I&#x27;ve filled out the shorts :)</li>

      <li>so far I&#x27;m loving mine!</li>
      <li>and i see a huge difference</li>
      <li>You are genetically predisposed to where you carry the most of your bodyfat &amp; where it will be the first to go.</li>
      <li>Seen a change right away !</li>
      <li>Love this stuff just purchased ready to see the results</li>
      <li>Many people that know me very well have noticed before I had a chance to mention it.</li>
      <li>If anyone is wanting a more natural approach to enhancing your assets this is the way to go &amp; if anyone has any questions, doubts, or concerns email me at allenjada306@gmail.com!</li>
      <li>Tried this product and felt a sensation right away.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping, 5 stars.</li>
      <li>evening you have to be consistent.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>First of all I have not nor do I know anyone who has purchased this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently twice a day along</li>
      <li>, I know I really like the product!</li>
      <li>I am still on my first jar &amp; today is June 19.</li>
      <li>So make sure you spread the cream over your entire thigh area is this is your target concern area!</li>
      <li>First time trying this product</li>
      <li>I am a curvy lady and every time I focus on working out, the first thing to go is my butt.</li>
      <li>I used it twice a day consistently in the beginning.</li>
      <li>my next order I&#x27;m going to focus more on my hips...</li>
      <li>Many women complain about &amp;#34;losing their butt&amp;#34; when starting out a new workout plan.</li>
      <li>I wish they had a money back guarantee but its fine.</li>
      <li>and I can now see a slight indention in my thigh where my upper thigh is getting more plump than the lower thigh where I did not rub the cream!!</li>
      <li>Like it really worked fast for me</li>
      <li>it really lives up to its expectations.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m real and will give yall an update in 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I dont really think Butt cream work for veryskinny people, its not a miracle cream</li>
      <li>Your glutes are a muscle work the muscle and learn how to scuplt your body with exercerise for real results.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I kind of wasted but lesson learned.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong minty smell and tingled a little when I put it on.</li>
      <li>My first bottle has lasted me since about mid april.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: Whenever I worked out intensely, my butt would be the first to go.</li>
      <li>So if you have a butt and want to enhance it, I highly recommend pureleef.</li>
      <li>No negative side effects and it has now been 2 months.</li>
      <li>i never even beleived that a cream would make ur butt bigger, just wanted to give it a try, well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Am gonna keep using this and buy more to see if am gonna add few inches</li>
      <li>picture on the left is 4.13.15 and 5.1.15 on the right .</li>
      <li>So as I researched products, as I am not a fan of surgery, I ran across this new one and decided to try it out.</li>
      <li>Had it almost a month really haven&#x27;t seen any major difference</li>
      <li>Not only have I noticed plumping in my butt, I have also notice my stretch marks fading you must be consistent.</li>
      <li>The first month I used the cream in conjunction with squats the second month</li>
      <li>If you are consistent initially and wein off to once a day with moderate exercise, you (and others haha)</li>
      <li>my butt is plumper &amp; my hips have actually filled in a little.</li>
      <li>I have used 1 jar so far.</li>
      <li>and I became very plump back there</li>
      <li>Paired with squats about 3 times a week (nothing major) and still results!</li>
      <li>Put it on tonight, used like a quarter size and can feel a icy hot sensation.  </li>
      <li>Been using this since the 19th of May and no results yet so can&#x27;t really give a bad or good review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s made my bottom a little more jiggly, but didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; like advertised or I just haven&#x27;t used it long enough for it to plump.</li>
      <li>You would think since its seemed to have launched in early 2015, there&#x27;d be a few TRUTHFUL, HELPFUL reviews, but there aren&#x27;t &amp; I won&#x27;t buy until I see a few</li>
      <li>This is simply because you are not eating enough calories &amp; doing too much cardio, not enough weight training.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tried it, saw minimal results, but that could all just be mental. IF you actually want to plump your booty up a bit, I recommend finding a program that works for you and STICKING TO IT.  This gimmicky stuff just doesn&#x27;t fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Found a deal on some good programs here -  www.buttgoals.com - if anybody is interested.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical of the cream. It has a very strong minty smell and tingled a little when I put it on. I used it about 2-3 times a day depending on how many showers I took. I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s made my bottom a little more jiggly, but didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; like advertised or I just haven&#x27;t used it long enough for it to plump. However, I did not work out at all to see if it actually worked. I&#x27;m debating on ordering another jar</li>
    <li> First time trying this product and I loved my results!! Also the price is right for this jar size!!</li>
    <li> I just posted this because I didn&#x27;t think it was fair to give 1star and your review says you didn&#x27;t purchase it!!! That&#x27;s not cool</li>
    <li> Hello, I have been using Pureleef since April 16, 2015. I apply the cream twice a day religiously lol! I did not exercise between April 16 &amp; May 11. I exercised at least 4 times a week between May 11 &amp; June 6. I am still on my first jar &amp; today is June 19. I definitely need another jar &amp; i will be happy to get two more based on my progress, I know I really like the product! I think my results are realistic, I also think the product works best with exercise! I wish this company the best!</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks i saw a dramatic difference&lt;br /&gt;it plumped up my butt giving it a better shape and my bony hips are no longer bony ^-^</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a single helpful testimonial about this product since I&#x27;ve researched it. Not here. Not Instagram. Not the official website, Google or even YouTube. You would think since its seemed to have launched in early 2015, there&#x27;d be a few TRUTHFUL, HELPFUL reviews, but there aren&#x27;t &amp; I won&#x27;t buy until I see a few - **ALSO** it&#x27;s reported you won&#x27;t see any results until about 2 months (2 jars) - all you April buyers - BE PATIENT - THEN review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.  I thought it would work but I saw no results. I wish they had a money back guarantee but its fine. I&#x27;m taking a loss on money.</li>
    <li> I love this! just a couple weeks and already noticing a difference :) can&#x27;t wait to order again. picture on the left is 4.13.15 and 5.1.15 on the right . you can see how I&#x27;ve filled out the shorts :) gonna start pairing with squats and see what happens!</li>
    <li> This works for me. Am curvy but i want more inches. Am 28 waist and 40 hips. Been using this for a month now and not even twice a day cus i forget sometimes and now am 41 hips. Like it really worked fast for me cus i have some fat down dat hips. I dont really think Butt cream work for veryskinny people, its not a miracle cream i never even beleived that a cream would make ur butt bigger, just wanted to give it a try, well worth the money. Am gonna keep using this and buy more to see if am gonna add few inches more.well stuff like this doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but m happy it worked for me yay</li>
    <li> I will be ordering another jar as I am happy with the results so far. One jar lasted almost two months for me. The first month I used the cream in conjunction with squats the second month I did not do any squats. I like the smell of the product and the tingling sensation lol. I&#x27;ll also be trying the breast cream. I figured why not, the butt and hip cream works matters well...</li>
    <li> PureLeef body plumping cream is working wonders on my butt and my hips. In fact I had no hips to begin with. I work out daily (squats) so that&#x27;s just a plus!!! I&#x27;m very happy with the results I am getting &amp; I love the fact that it&#x27;s a hormonal free product. I recommend this product to anyone wishing to enhance their buttocks &amp; hips.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product well over a month and I don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. I will continue to purchase it. It takes a few months before u see results but it worked and has made my butt and hips slightly bigger, smoother. I do not even work out, I&#x27;m sure if I did the results would be greater. Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff just purchased ready to see the results</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as most would be but if your dedicated to this cream, you will see results and so far I&#x27;m loving mine! I noticed results after 1 month of using twice as day as directed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks now and I am definitely seeing results.. I use it morning and before bed along with squatting and leg weight training. Not only have I noticed plumping in my butt, I have also notice my stretch marks fading you must be consistent. It smells like bengay but it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
    <li> Just used for first time last night and woke up with these weird purple bumps all over my butt. Guess I&#x27;m allergic or is that suppose to happen? It&#x27;s not itchy.  Won&#x27;t continue to use :(</li>
    <li> Good product!  I have had this cream for a few weeks now,  the thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting is that my butt looks smoother.  My butt looks rounder at the bottom however I will update again once I am done with my jar</li>
    <li> it worked for me..I love it..also add squats</li>
    <li> I definitely saw an improvement. I have used 1 jar so far. I used it twice a day consistently in the beginning. I kind of slacked off towards the end so my jar lasted about 2 months. I am ordering my next jar and this time I will pair using this with workouts. Update after jar #2 coming soon.</li>
    <li> This works wonders i&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and i see a huge difference like i see my hips getting wider. can&#x27;t wait to use it a little bit longer and  see results.</li>
    <li> Tried this product and felt a sensation right away. My husband asked me if I was wearing a butt pad. I will keep using.</li>
    <li> Noticing a good change!</li>
    <li> Been using this since the 19th of May and no results yet so can&#x27;t really give a bad or good review. It says you&#x27;ll see results within 2 months so I&#x27;ll keep you guys posted.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for almost 3 weeks now and my results are amazing. I apply cream twice a day morning and evening you have to be consistent.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all! None of my questions were answered! Horrible product, wouldn&#x27;t recommand it!</li>
    <li> I must say it has been working for me..I will be ordering more for sure!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in May! I have seen results. I rubbed this cream on my butt, hips and thigh area and I can now see a slight indention in my thigh where my upper thigh is getting more plump than the lower thigh where I did not rub the cream!! So make sure you spread the cream over your entire thigh area is this is your target concern area! Will be ordering another jar asap!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works!! If you are consistent initially and wein off to once a day with moderate exercise, you (and others haha) see/feel (smooth/softness) results! Will be buying my second bottle soon ! My first bottle has lasted me since about mid april.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: Whenever I worked out intensely, my butt would be the first to go. So I&#x27;m glad I can keep my shape now.</li>
    <li> Love ..love..love this product it really lives up to its expectations. I am  on my third jar. And loving it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. You definitely have to keep using it to see results but I used everyday twice a day and I became very plump back there lol</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any change and I am almost finish with my jar.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome gave my butt a round plump shape takes a while to finally work but I love it 😍</li>
    <li> It was ok... too bad is not permanent. .. you definitely see a difference  when you work out... do squads and lounges</li>
    <li> Had it almost a month really haven&#x27;t seen any major difference</li>
    <li> Seriously? This is a scam. Nothing that you rub on your skin will awaken fat cells. It&#x27;s not how anatomy works. Ladies be okay with your tits and if you must have a booty then go work for it. Rubbing a cream on your butt isn&#x27;t going to create fat cells out of no where. Your glutes are a muscle work the muscle and learn how to scuplt your body with exercerise for real results.</li>
    <li> Works prefect! Seen a change right away !</li>
    <li> My cream just arrived today ! Very fast shipping, 5 stars. Put it on tonight, used like a quarter size and can feel a icy hot sensation.  I&#x27;m real and will give yall an update in 2 weeks. I will post pics as well. I bought this because I seen it on IG and draya was promoting it...lol...my IG welcome2nikkisworld ....Stay tuned......</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any results yet, but it&#x27;s only been 1 month....</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a couple of weeks and I must admit it has done what I expected it to do; maintain my butt. I am a curvy lady and every time I focus on working out, the first thing to go is my butt. So as I researched products, as I am not a fan of surgery, I ran across this new one and decided to try it out. IT WORKS! Now as I work out, I apply the cream nightly before bed. My own preference. So if you have a butt and want to enhance it, I highly recommend pureleef. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a butt but I mainly got this for my hips because I have narrow indented hips. &amp; this cream is amazing. I&#x27;m on my second jar, believe me I was super skeptical about this &amp; I didn&#x27;t see too many good reviews &amp; wasn&#x27;t sure if the good ones I did see were real people, but I took a leap &amp; I ordered &amp; my butt is plumper &amp; my hips have actually filled in a little. I also work out which made the results even better. I love this cream I will continue to order until I hit the maximum results. If anyone is wanting a more natural approach to enhancing your assets this is the way to go &amp; if anyone has any questions, doubts, or concerns email me at allenjada306@gmail.com! Pureleef is awesome!!</li>
    <li> Heard about this from a friend so I tried it. Not only did I want to have a bigger butt but I wanted my hips to spread as well.  It&#x27;s working in both areas.  My only negative is that it took 4 months to work but at least it&#x27;s working so I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS STUFF!! If your worried about trying it... Try it! I swear in 3 weeks I&#x27;ve already noticed a plumper booty. Paired with squats about 3 times a week (nothing major) and still results!</li>
    <li> First of all I have not nor do I know anyone who has purchased this product.  Second I have posted questions which have been deleted so I figured I would comment and see if my comment gets deleted.  I asked how the crème knows it&#x27;s being applied to your butt because some questions were asked if this product can be used on other body parts, in which the answer was &amp;#34;No.&amp;#34;  So how does the crème know it&#x27;s being placed on the butt and only works on the butt?  I know there is a crème for the breasts which I assume only works on the breasts.  Again, how does the crème know where it is being applied?  Logic would say if the crème makes your butt fatter and breasts fatter by stimulating fat cells, then the crème would in fact stimulate fat cells no matter where it is applied.  I bet if they advertised their crème makes men&#x27;s specific body parts bigger they would increase sales 10 fold!  It&#x27;s your money, spend it how you want to, but you may want to stop and smell the roses every once in a while....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff now for about 2 1/2 weeks and I&#x27;m seeing a difference in my butt &amp; my hips are spreading. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently twice a day along w/squats. It works!</li>
    <li> Works Well! Reordering again my booty is plumping &amp; rounding✔️👏</li>
    <li> It starts to feel good for the first hour or so but I haven&#x27;t seen what I expected so $50.00 I kind of wasted but lesson learned. I love you Draya but it wasn&#x27;t what it was cracked up to be.</li>
    <li> I love this product...it worked wonders on my butt..my next order I&#x27;m going to focus more on my hips...I wish I took a b4 &amp; after photo..but I see and feel the results. Just know it works,can&#x27;t wait for my second order which will be in a couple of days...</li>
    <li> It actually works. I have noticed results in about 3 weeks. No negative side effects and it has now been 2 months. Many people that know me very well have noticed before I had a chance to mention it. I have not done squats and I model swimwear. I dislike the mint sensation when you first put it on, but it does smell good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that any company would target vulnerable women who are unsatisfied with their body. An &amp;#34;ingredient&amp;#34; that you rub onto your skin will NOT &amp;#34;awaken&amp;#34; fat cells. I mean, how silly does this sound? Fat cells don&#x27;t sleep. You either have body fat, or you don&#x27;t. You are genetically predisposed to where you carry the most of your bodyfat &amp; where it will be the first to go. Many women complain about &amp;#34;losing their butt&amp;#34; when starting out a new workout plan. This is simply because you are not eating enough calories &amp; doing too much cardio, not enough weight training. Shame on this company.</li>
    <li> I bought the product and have been using it for three weeks. I&#x27;ve used it as directed as well as, have been in the gym doing leg/butt exercises. After 3 weeks, there haven&#x27;t been any results. My skin tingles at the area of application but there isn&#x27;t any plumping as stated. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Starting seeing a difference after only 2 1/2 weeks</li>
    <li> Great product.  My girl has seem results in a matter of weeks and she loves it. The odor is kinda strong</li>
