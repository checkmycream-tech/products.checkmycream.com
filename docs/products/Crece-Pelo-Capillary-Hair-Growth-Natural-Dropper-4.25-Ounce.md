<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> just wonderful, great product I just bought the set of shampoo/conditioner, love it</li>
    <li> Good product fast delivery</li>
    <li> I like the drops.  My hair has grown.  I use most of the line.  I like the drops because I hate to cake my scalp with too much oil unless I am washing it out the next day.  But I still want my scalp to be fed nutrients to aid in faster growth so this is great.  I use it on wash days, whether I decide to wear it curly or straight.</li>
    <li> Too early to say if it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
    <li> The product is to watery. I only use for three days but when using its rolling down my neck and face. I will not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this product..it came fast. It makes my hair feel soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this product. I shaved my head about four months ago and it has already grown to my shoulders. It smells wonderful. I recommend this product for anyone trying to grow out their hair!</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair look awful and dirty.  You HAVE to wash your hair daily or you look like you rolled around in baby oil. Im not sure how you would use this product and take the time to see any results.  You put it on in the daytime, then you better plan on wearing a hat or something if you go out of the house.  Unless you don&#x27;t care that your hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed in a few days or put it in over night and was your hair in the morning.  I don&#x27;t know if that would be enough time with it on your scalp to be effective though...</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me. I&#x27;m nearly done with my bottle and to me it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> My hair grows like crazy after this I add in Kera care oil and my hair has grown alot</li>
    <li> Works very well on AA 4b/4c hair. Makes the hair very soft. It especially helped with the crown area of my head where hair tends to mat if not moisturized well.</li>
    <li> The product that I vault last month I sent it back, because someone already gave me one it was a surprise for me because I was talking about this product so much but it worked out fine for me I haven&#x27;t seen much growth but will continue to use it thank you</li>
    <li> SORRY BUT THIS PRODUCT IS A FREAKING JOKE ITS WATER</li>
    <li> This is  really a good product.. I saw results super fast.  I&#x27;d say weekly to the point where my hair dresser is amazed at my hair growth..she has no idea i have been using a dropper to push the growth of my hair. I am on my third bottle , my hair is full, strong  to the tip this product is also in- expensive  compared to others out there. Good Stuff!</li>
    <li> I purchased this back in May of &#x27;13. I wanted to give it some time before I posted a review.&lt;br /&gt;No visible boost to regular hair growth, my hair is still growing at the same rate. I applied it alone to my scalp. Mixed with all natural oils. Mixed with conditioners. I even tried it on my eye brows when I had a &amp;#34;threading&amp;#34; accident. Nothing exciting at all. It does smell good- kind of like bamboo water. Doesn&#x27;t burn or itch at all either but I sense it&#x27;s just water with a little something added. Nothing I&#x27;d ever bother purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and price! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good if your hair loss is from foods or medications.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it does makes you hair looks healthier and thicker over a period of time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product sept 2, 2013 after reading and reviewing all the reviews. mostly good and some not good. i decided to purchase it. My hair is very thick &amp; semi wavy and over the past few weeks it began to thin around my edges and nape area to due chemical treatments and stress so i decided to use the drops along with the Crece pelo shampoo and leave in conditioner. THIS product is amazing. my hair is growing back and starting to look full and HEALTHY for the first time in my life. when i go to the salon i take my shampoo and conditioner with me. i use the drops on the areas that i needed most attention 3x daily. i would massage the liquid in my hair, the only minor set back is that it&#x27;s extremely watery but other then that. this product works wonders for me. honestly i was a little hesitant to purchase it not knowing if the reviews were true or not but looking at my hair and how much it has thickened out and how healthy it looks. i can truly say that this product works. it&#x27;s the best thing i ever used on my hair and i will continue to support the entire product line..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i give this product 4 stars because i do see alot of improvement in my hair and even though my hair is not at the status i would like it to be i&#x27;m still happy and comfortable with my hair. i can wear my hair in a pony tail now or pinned up and not have to worry about the thining edges. i would recommend this product to anyone who is having problems with thining or bald spots. try this product and use it at your own discrection.</li>
    <li> This is amazing product .</li>
    <li> Awesome product it really work. ..my hair was really broken but it already started growing back thanks to using this product..definitely a winner</li>
    <li> My hair grow 2inches in height. Love this stuff can&#x27;t wait to get more of it sooner thab later yes</li>
    <li> This leaves your hair smelling good for days!  The condition of my hair looks and feels better.  This with the treatment was more than I expected for the first use.</li>
    <li> I just started using so I hope it works on me!!</li>
    <li> My hair loves this treatment!!! It is so much healthy and its growing fast , which is great! great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had a bald spot that would not grow back!~ Since Crece Pelo, it grew back! This product is great! I also used their shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This  product really works now mind you it takes months but it will fill in a bald spot, I&#x27;ve tried everything out there and saw no difference tired of spending money I came across this, what I love is its not greasy, smells great. Your scalp seems to absorb when applied highly highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have a feeling that hair on the top of my head became more dense. It&#x27;s only slightly oily, so there&#x27;s no sticky feeling after usage.</li>
    <li> Gift to my niece. Don&#x27;t know if she likes it or even if it works.</li>
    <li> Just got this product last month, so far I like the product especially its scent. I like it is just a great, no sticky, oily texture, love it.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works it&#x27;s very watery and just runs right off my scalp for my natural hair type</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a Saturday and it came Monday. Impressive. I purchased this because my friend had a bald spot and his beautician recommend this to him. Thanks to the drops his hair grew not only where he had the bald spot but I never seen his hair look this great. It has length, body, looks healthy, and smells good. I have thinning Hair around my crown area. Keeping my fingers crossed I get the same results. Other places sell this for over $20. Im glad i purchased it here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the entire set of products and my hair has grown a couple of inches in a few weeks. I like it better than my more expensive products.</li>
    <li> Have use this product for several weeks , not very good results. Smells nice does not burn scalp , does not grow hair . Will try another product .</li>
    <li> I feel like this is just water and it hasn&#x27;t done nothing for me. Such a waste.</li>
    <li> I believe this is helping, but I&#x27;m also using Biotin capsules!</li>
    <li> I bought both this and the shampoo, I can see how this works amazingly. I have been using it for 3 months now and I can see a lot of new hair growing. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t give any indication on how much you&#x27;re supposed to use. I did use it regularly but it had no effect on my hair...</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing product.. I experienced hair loss a year ago, a friend told me about this product and I use it morning and at night an my hair has grown like wildflowers.  You have to be patient, you will NOT see hair growth over night.  I have been using this for alomst 3 months and I have to say my hair has grom at least 3-4&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. What it gave me was dandruff :( that required months of treatments.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and so far I love it!</li>
    <li> This product did not do anything for my hair. It is really thin like water with a scent. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, It really help for my hair loss, its really easy to aplly and cover the expectations, really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three months and so far, no real change in shedding, thickness or hair growth.  It smells exactly like the shampoo/conditioner/leave in which is like cotton.  No strong mentol smell but also no tingling sensation either.  Felt like I was just adding water to my scalp. Not sure I will re-purchase it.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this product.  I have beautiful thick Afro-hair; and I was surprised at how well it detangled my hair.  I read both the positive and negative reviews.  And a few negatives stated that it matted and snarled their hair; but the majority of the users were satisfied.  Now... I truly wonder if the negative reviews were just haters or something; because it actually does the opposite; even on tightly coiled hair.  I almost cancelled this after submitting my order for it, but they had already shipped it.  And  intuitively I felt this was a good product. On my right temple edge I had trouble getting a small section to thicken. And after years of using various products for treatment... it was no longer noticeable...  but was still weak.  And I believe that everything happens for a reason.  And I was amazed in a week at how healthy it got after using this product.  And decided after that to experience their entire product line. I am still experimenting with their products... and so far I am extremely impressed with the quality of the results.  They have a superior product for supporting and maintaining healthy hair 4 real!.</li>
    <li> Crece Pelo Capillary Hair Growth Natural Dropper works wonders for my scalp and hair. You will see results if you use it every day after 6-weeks. It takes time to show results depending on the issues you have with your hair and scalp. My hair was weak and breaking. My scalp was very dry and tight. After using this product for just 3-weeks, I saw a great improvement in my scalp and my hair now have shine and elasticity to it. My hair is stronger and more healthy looking. It did wonders for my scalp. It&#x27;s like hair food. It feeds the scalp so you can have healthier hair. I also saw new growth in spots on my scalp where my hair was thin like my crown area. I massage it into my crown area everyday. Now my crown area is thicker and healthier. I give this product 10-stars. The entire Crec Pelo hair care line is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have serious hair issues, try the shampoo,rinse,treatment,and leave-in. Massage the Capillary Hair growth Natural Dropper on your scalp every day. You will see results as soon as 2-weeks. You will have thick, healthy, shiny, strong, silky, soft, manageable sexy hair in no time. Crece Pelo is rated #1 most favorite dominican treatment on the market today. Don&#x27;t think about just buy it. You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> I bought this because someone told me it was great nourishment. The are absolutely right. This product made my roots so silky smooth like babys hair. I let my mom use this since her hair started to shed and she saw a major improvement. She has really fine hair within two weeks she had a head full of hair and her hair grew 2 inches.</li>
    <li> This is making my hair grow, it is real.</li>
    <li> Purchased 6-3-14 and received in about a week. I tested it on forearm and waited a day. I have been faithfully applying it to an area of my scalp that was BALD twice a day and now I have peach fuzz and hair strands when I thought this bald spot would never see hair! These results came in 3 months. I will purchase again to continue and strengthen the new growth.</li>
    <li> great product, it grows your hair, without burning it, like rogain</li>
    <li> product arrived on time, smells great , It made my hair shiny and healthy , I might order again !!</li>
    <li> Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had experienced a severe allergic reaction to this serum!! The areas I place the product began to swell. My ears , right side of my face began to swell dramatically after about 10 minutes. I had to  wash the serum out, take medicine and subsequently follow up with my doctor. If anyone is going to purchase this product, I suggest you do research on the ingredients  contained in it.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, goes on watery...must massage it in right away so that it doesn&#x27;t drip.  I haven&#x27;t seen any growth yet, but what I believe is happening, is that this stuff caused your hair to stop breaking so that your hair can be healthy enough to grow.  I am very happy and look forward to see how this works on me after a few months.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t work for me at all , the top of the dropper kept falling off , so eventually I ended up throwing it out .  The product didn&#x27;t work for my hair didn&#x27;t see a difference in my hair at all.  So don&#x27;t waste your time buying this product , try something else !!!!</li>
    <li> My mouth is open, because this product really work. My hair is growing in little bit time. Using together with the phitoterapeutic treatment are fabulous.</li>
    <li> Me encanta este product.&lt;br /&gt;Lo he venido usando por 2 semanas y he visto grandes cambios, mi cabellos ha crecido, ademas huele delicioso.</li>
    <li> It worked well for me! I like the feeling it gives when you spray it on your scalp and it is still working perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> will buy againa really great read who would have known. but it was a good read loved it and would look for similar</li>
    <li> Since I started using this about 1 month ago my thin hair started growing back instantly. Not only does it help my hair grow but I feel the difference in the texture of my hair. It just feels stronger. I put it on the spots that need the most help every night before I wrap my hair and then all over my hair right after I wash my hair. I will keep this in my hair regimen forever!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing but I don&#x27;t see too much of a diference. I do think it is good though. Still unsure if will buy again. I did just buy the whole line of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I thought is was hair serum</li>
    <li> The product is good, but I realized it was more expensive than the beautiy supply by my house. I may as well would of have bought it from there.</li>
    <li> producto resibido ,muchas grasias ,tiene 5 estrella</li>
    <li> It is a great product! My hair is growing ridiculously long, fast, and healthy. My boyfriend also uses it on his hairline and it grew back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t use other hair growth products.</li>
    <li> This product helped my thinning hair on the top of my head. It took about 8 months to see a difference but , I now have a year later a thick head of hair for this product.</li>
    <li> it sucks it doesnt do anything</li>
    <li> Widow&#x27;s peak has been recessing over the years. I started using this product and I am seeing small hair follicle pores opening up after 4 weeks of use. The hair hasn&#x27;t broken through the skin yet...will update post if I have full hair growth.</li>
    <li> Works well on my relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> Love the Crece Pelo products but this one I am not too sure about. It is very runny but you have to massage it in. I give it 3 stars because I did experience more shedding when I use it everyday like recommended.</li>
    <li> Started using it after it arrived, Waiting on the results to see if there is a change of any kind. Lets keep our fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t promote hair growth. In fact it did the opposite so that sucks. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it nor would I buy again. I purchased the product back in 2012 and it&#x27;s now 2014 and I still have a full bottle. I completely forgot about it.</li>
    <li> I used the product in the morning after shampooing and in the evening before going to bed. I saw results in 1 week. I have very fine, limp hair that I thought by cutting very short would generate thicker growth. I wanted my long hair back, FAST! and my friend recommended this product which I am now a huge fan of \\&quot; )</li>
    <li> leaves my scalp smelling nice, but has a tendency to cause build up on your scalp if you don&#x27;t wash your hair daily</li>
    <li> I love it, it smells good and it works for my hair.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this product havent seen any new growth yet but it still smells wonerful would not try it again</li>
    <li> Really works well! my hair is full and thick now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product!!! It smell great! It refreshes your hair. It makes my hair feel very soft and manageable.  Yes, it appears to be growing my hair back.</li>
    <li> Excellent producto! my hair used to be so damaged after using this consistently after every wash on my scalp ,I see a big difference in shedding and growth. Just as the deep  conditioner it&#x27;s a magic product.you have to be consistent or you will not see a difference. takes a long time to see the results about 6 months whatever is worth having is worth the patience!</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing. This is just water in a bottle with some weird scent infused into it. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I can see new hair growing, and my hair strands have thickened. My scalp feels great, no itching whatsoever. In fact, I also put it on the rest of my hair after massaging my scalp, for better results. This  product smells good, that from time to time, I get compliments on how good my hair smells.</li>
    <li> it did not do anything for me ? but smell good !</li>
    <li> I have used these products in the past and they are great!! Anything that helps with Cappilary Growth is always Great! Be Blessed and Prayer Grows the Hair!! Put God 1st in ALL THINGS! :)</li>
    <li> I have had difficulty with my hair since the birth of my daughter, bald spots, shedding and thinning on my crown and around the sides. After spending thousands of dollars on laser treatments, injections and prescriptions from the dermatologist I read the reviews and figured why not try this. Well I can say its been 10 days and new hair is growing in spots that I haven&#x27;t had hair in two years. Its stronger, very soft and for the first time in a long time I feel confident about the possibility of having a healthy head of hair. For the price its worth the try and I&#x27;m so happy its working for me!!</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me.  It was a waste of money and a complete waste of time.  Reviews on this product are way fabricated because it was like putting water on your scalp.</li>
    <li> Does nothing, waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like water with a nice smell-</li>
    <li> have used it for one week, feels great on the hair.</li>
    <li> Grate very nice result</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this product would work. Going thought menopause I lost quite a bit of hair.  Within a month of using this product I saw New growth. After two months noticed my hair had grown.  Very pleased, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Felt like a gimmick type concoction.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working and it smells great!  I apply it on my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and mine for a few days before I wash it which is once a week and I do notice a slight difference in only a month use. I also decided to stop doing the Dominican blowout so that I can see if my hair stops thinning out.</li>
    <li> so far so good, have been using for about a month now, I have noticed a small amount of hair coming in but it&#x27;s only been a month, will see in about 2 more months</li>
</ol>
