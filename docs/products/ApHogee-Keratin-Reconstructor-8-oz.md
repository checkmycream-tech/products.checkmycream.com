      <li>It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
      <li>Very pleased!!!!!</li>
      <li>Loved it!  </li>
      <li>It works great on those parts of my hair.</li>
      <li>Smells great, and my hair just shines after using.</li>
      <li>Great purchase.</li>
      <li>Love this!!</li>
      <li>Easy to use, great results, and well priced on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but you have to make sure you have  a good moisturizer to apply afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the texture of my hair after using the product.</li>
      <li>I had great results very much like having it done by professionals.</li>
      <li>Just love this stuff.</li>
      <li>my hair went from a healthy 3c/4a/4b to a heat damaged</li>
      <li>DID USE IT IN HAIR FOR MORE LIKE</li>
      <li>but i was able to dematt it ,anyhow i applied two handfuls of this n a heating cap</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>I preferred the Paul Mitchell system much better.</li>
      <li>my hair didn&#x27;t look like healthy 2b hair, it looked like stringy and damaged 2b hair.</li>
      <li>Glad I have it a try.  </li>
      <li>Great Product that leaves here soft and stronger!</li>
      <li>It works great as a light protein treatment for my natural  hair.</li>
      <li>This product is probably good for normal hair</li>
      <li>Hair with too much protein will break more following this treatment, but when used properly it is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product ONLY if your hair benefits form protein treatments.</li>
      <li>I find it best used about 2 to 4 weeks before you are getting a relaxer but no more than once every 8 weeks.</li>
      <li>The next time I use it I will ensure that I apply a good moisturizer to my hair afterwards.</li>
      <li>I mixed it with olive oil and the results were really good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and smells great and definitely restores a sense of strength to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did and it worked after the first time I used it!  </li>
      <li>great for my relaxed hair, I use it every few washes not just when I relax my hair.</li>
      <li>This product works great after using heat on your hair to bring those curls back to their natural state.</li>
      <li>It doubles nicely for a deep conditoner.</li>
      <li>While I can feel that my hair is more porous due to the bleach (takes longer to get oily), it is actually in -better- condition post-bleach.</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced, but I did not noticed any significant difference.</li>
      <li>I ran out of my normal conditioner and didn&#x27;t really feel like going out to buy more.</li>
      <li>My scalp and hair look and feel 100 time better, I&#x27;ve stopped losing so much hair and see new hair growth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok not as good as other conditioners such as the macadamia one.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so soft and strong</li>
      <li>Howeever, this is a good maintenance product for me and works wonders on my relaxed, color treated hair whenever it needs a little protein.  </li>
      <li>well i thought i did at first.</li>
      <li>At first I used it twice a month</li>
      <li>This is definitely one DIY product I would recommend to save you some money and have your hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>This product was ok, but I have gone back to my Dermo Organic masque.</li>
      <li>I think I left it in for about 45 minutes (no dryer, just watching my favorite show).</li>
      <li>just make sure you deep condition, for moisture, after you use the reconstructor to balance your hair, because this is a protein treatment and you need to add moisture</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re hair has gone through something as damaging as bleach for example, this is (probably) going to be exactly what you need to revitalize your hair.</li>
      <li>I thought that I needed to deep condition it more often and that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>the 1 st time i used it i instantly noticed most curls came back (i lost all my lovely curls thanks to the wintery season).</li>
      <li>My hair has the right amount of stretch, isn&#x27;t easily tangled, and is overall stronger for using this product.</li>
      <li>Followed the directions exactly and got positive results with that as well.</li>
      <li>the best way i can describe how my hair felt like... wet dead leaves.</li>
      <li>I will certainly purchase again.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I needed it to which is to restore some strength to a part of my hair that has been highly processed.</li>
      <li>I tried using it on the rest of my hair as well, and it just doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure within a few more treatments they&#x27;ll be back!</li>
      <li>Since that&#x27;s so light, I follow it up with a 30 min deep conditioner using my Keracare Moisturing conditioner.</li>
      <li>my hair felt wet and mushy but the water was just sitting on the top of my hair strands</li>
      <li>Adding too much protein to the hair can be damaging.</li>
      <li>im very ashamed to say</li>
      <li>i thought i was using too much protein because just about every product i used had protein in it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell, the main reason I&#x27;m taking off stars.</li>
      <li>but ,i went a few days maybe more like weeks without doing my hair and it started matting almost dred</li>
      <li>i have very long full hair</li>
      <li>My hair is very protein sensitive, so I&#x27;m not able to use this more than once a month.</li>
      <li>I used this product for the first time following a bleach job.</li>
      <li>So products like reconstructors are just too much for my hair, making it feel dry from too much protein.</li>
      <li>This works wonders for our (natural) hair.  </li>
      <li>Silky and soft.</li>
      <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t been processed much at all, and I already do regular coconut oil treatments, and I don&#x27;t use heat products.</li>
      <li>I have natural hair.  </li>
      <li>AND SO FAR HAS MADE MY HAIR FEEL SOFTER AFTER JUST 2 USES.</li>
      <li>Meaning, if your hair is highly processed or bleached, and you currently aren&#x27;t treating it with anything, then you will live this.</li>
      <li>As I stated, I have coarse hair and even this mild protein goes a long way for me,</li>
      <li>The smell on this was a little off as well, not a nice clean fresh smell at all, and it stuck after rinsing it out too!!</li>
      <li>When I rinsed it out, my hair felt strong, thick and soft.</li>
      <li>but my hair is very fine and thin and</li>
      <li>Used this to bring back the natural silky texture to my hair!</li>
      <li>This is my first time ever using and found that in the beginning it left my hair dry.  </li>
      <li>I waited a week for a second treatment and so far haven&#x27;t felt I needed to use it again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Instantly left my hair feeling soft and supple.</li>
      <li>After applying some intense moisture products, my hair was tipping a little too far on the moisture side and needed some protein.</li>
      <li>I had been a brunette and when i went back to my natural blonde my hair was suffering from the process.</li>
      <li>Even with my usual mousse, my hair won&#x27;t style right after using conditioner.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t my first time using this product so I actually started using it a few years ago and always reorder when its time to revive my hair.  </li>

    <li> im very ashamed to say but ,i went a few days maybe more like weeks without doing my hair and it started matting almost dred lIke i thought i would have to cut it but i went to the beauty supply brought a bottle of creme of nature detangling shampoo ,conditioned with herbal essence smoothing shampoo to help comb it out (alot came out)but i have very long full hair it was left very brittle n stiff with the herb. conditioner being in for hours but i was able to dematt it ,anyhow i applied two handfuls of this n a heating cap OMG THIS STUFF IS WONDERRRRFUL I TELL U IF I DIDNT TRY N SEE I WOULDNOT BELIVE THE SILKY,SHINY NO HAIR IN COMB HAIR I WAS LEFT WITH AFTER THIS STUFF CAME OUT .I DID USE IT IN HAIR FOR MORE LIKE AN HOUR BUT SHOOT THIS STUFF WORKS WELLLLL!!!!WILL BE ORDERING THIS MONTHLY OR BI-MONTHLY</li>
    <li> It works great as a light protein treatment for my natural  hair. It doubles nicely for a deep conditoner. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I used this product once before and I don&#x27;t recall being overenthused by the results. I ran out of my normal conditioner and didn&#x27;t really feel like going out to buy more. Ofcoure, I started digging through the hair bin from hell. You know what I mean ladies. Anyway, I found this and decided to give it a try. I mixed it with olive oil and the results were really good. I kept it on for longer than instructed. I&#x27;m sorry, but 5-minutes just wasn&#x27;t going to do it. I think I left it in for about 45 minutes (no dryer, just watching my favorite show). When I rinsed it out, my hair felt strong, thick and soft. A definite winner in my book.</li>
    <li> Instantly left my hair feeling soft and supple. I really liked the texture of my hair after using the product. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so I&#x27;ll expand my review when the bottle&#x27;s contents have been used.</li>
    <li> Loved it!  I wash my hair and there is limited or no shedding. This is a miracle product that will remain in my staple of must have products for ever!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft and strong</li>
    <li> Great Product!  This isn&#x27;t my first time using this product so I actually started using it a few years ago and always reorder when its time to revive my hair.  This product works great after using heat on your hair to bring those curls back to their natural state.</li>
    <li> I must admit after some of the negative reviews I was a little hesitant to give this product a try.  However, I&#x27;m glad that I did.  After applying some intense moisture products, my hair was tipping a little too far on the moisture side and needed some protein. Since I have coarse hair I&#x27;m always cautious when it comes to products that contain protein. Howeever, this is a good maintenance product for me and works wonders on my relaxed, color treated hair whenever it needs a little protein.  I use it just as instructed, leaving it on for 2-3 min and following that with the 5 min aphogee balancing conditioner.  Since that&#x27;s so light, I follow it up with a 30 min deep conditioner using my Keracare Moisturing conditioner. As I stated, I have coarse hair and even this mild protein goes a long way for me, following it up with a moisturing conditioner is a MUST unless I want a head of straw. This product makes my hair feel stronger and softer. Glad I have it a try.  I even tried the 2-step (smelly stuff) which is some serious protein when my hair was feeling limp and stretchy. Followed the directions exactly and got positive results with that as well. While my hair felt a little hard afterwards, my fav Keracare moisture conditioner took care of that. Incorporating this protein treatement into my hair regiment has allowed me to stretch my relaxers another few weeks. It stops breakage and makes my hair stronger.</li>
    <li> This past summer, I kept having a problem with my hair shedding and being dry and brittle.  It didn&#x27;t have the shine or the luster that I was used to having.  I thought that I needed to deep condition it more often and that didn&#x27;t work.  Finally a friend of mine suggested trying the ApHogee protein to see if that helped.  I did and it worked after the first time I used it!  Immediately, I could tell a difference.  I followed up with the ApHogee 2 n 1 conditioner once a week.  I find it best used about 2 to 4 weeks before you are getting a relaxer but no more than once every 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> My hair is very protein sensitive, so I&#x27;m not able to use this more than once a month. Otherwise, it does its job. I don&#x27;t like the smell, the main reason I&#x27;m taking off stars.</li>
    <li> IT IS A ONCE A WEEK TREATMENT AND SO FAR HAS MADE MY HAIR FEEL SOFTER AFTER JUST 2 USES.</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged by perms and color.  I used this along with other ApHogee products (shampoo, Keratin treatment and balancing cream)  My hair no longer has the &amp;#34;broke off&amp;#34; look.  I will be using nothing but ApHogee products from this point on.  I swear by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Be warned**  You can only use this every 6 weeks!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product ONLY if your hair benefits form protein treatments. Meaning, if your hair is highly processed or bleached, and you currently aren&#x27;t treating it with anything, then you will live this. It&#x27;s very creamy and smells great and definitely restores a sense of strength to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However for me, my hair typically doesn&#x27;t react well to products with protein in it. My hair hasn&#x27;t been processed much at all, and I already do regular coconut oil treatments, and I don&#x27;t use heat products. So products like reconstructors are just too much for my hair, making it feel dry from too much protein. So why did I buy this product? Well.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I bleached two, platinum blonde streaks in my hair, and I ordered this to use on the bleached parts of my hair. It works great on those parts of my hair. It does exactly what I needed it to which is to restore some strength to a part of my hair that has been highly processed. So I ONLY use it on those sections. I tried using it on the rest of my hair as well, and it just doesn&#x27;t really do anything. It does feel slightly drier than usual, which is the opposite of what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to conclude, if you end up buying this product, I recommend trying it on a small section of hair and leaving it on for no more than 2 minutes, like the directions say. Adding too much protein to the hair can be damaging. But if you&#x27;re hair has gone through something as damaging as bleach for example, this is (probably) going to be exactly what you need to revitalize your hair.</li>
    <li> This is my go to weekly.. Love this!!</li>
    <li> I had been a brunette and when i went back to my natural blonde my hair was suffering from the process. Used this to bring back the natural silky texture to my hair!</li>
    <li> This works wonders for our (natural) hair.  Easy to use, great results, and well priced on Amazon.  I will certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> i moved to PA from GA last june and i thought i would have to get my hair cut back off because my hair became dry and fragile. after a month or 2, i had finally got my dry and thirsty hair under control. well i thought i did at first. but after a couple months went by, the winter came and my hair became.... idk how to describe the condition of my hair!!!! i thought i was using too much protein because just about every product i used had protein in it so i stopped using protein products. (my hair wasn&#x27;t use to the harsh winter, that is why it became so dry, not because of the proteins but at the time i didn&#x27;t know that was the reason). once i stopped using protein, my hair became worse. it was SO DRY, the LOC method stopped working, then i started using shea butter, which helped a little. so i started spraying it with water almost everyday to keep it from drying out, which also helped a little bit but made it worse at the same time. it helped because the water added moisture to my hair and it made it worse because i was over moisturizing my hair and not adding any proteins. so my hair became mushy and felt wet even when it was dry. i started using biotin supplements, which only helped with hair growth. my hair went from a healthy 3c/4a/4b to a heat damaged (well in this case, a winter damaged) 2b( my hair didn&#x27;t curl up at all anymore, it went from tight curls to big waves). my hair didn&#x27;t look like healthy 2b hair, it looked like stringy and damaged 2b hair. my hair was mushy and felt wet but it also felt and sounded like dead leaves in the winter time. the best way i can describe how my hair felt like... wet dead leaves. my hair felt wet and mushy but the water was just sitting on the top of my hair strands but then i found the ApHogee 2 minute reconstructor and seen that it was for damaged hair and bought it. the 1 st time i used it i instantly noticed most curls came back (i lost all my lovely curls thanks to the wintery season). my hair isnt dull anymore, its back to it pre-winter state. i recommend this to people who hair was damaged by the wintery season. it says that its for heat damaged, hard water damaged, or permed hair but i had winter damaged hair and it worked so well. just make sure you deep condition, for moisture, after you use the reconstructor to balance your hair, because this is a protein treatment and you need to add moisture so your hair wont become dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> great for my relaxed hair, I use it every few washes not just when I relax my hair. leaves my hair softer and feeling healthier.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time following a bleach job. I bleached all my waist-length hair, washed it out, followed up with ApHogee Keratin Reconstructor as the bottle instructs, and finished with a Burt&#x27;s Bees deep conditioning treatment. While I can feel that my hair is more porous due to the bleach (takes longer to get oily), it is actually in -better- condition post-bleach. My hair has the right amount of stretch, isn&#x27;t easily tangled, and is overall stronger for using this product. I waited a week for a second treatment and so far haven&#x27;t felt I needed to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using you should read up on protein vs moisture in hair to help identify your hair&#x27;s needs. Hair with too much protein will break more following this treatment, but when used properly it is an excellent product. Always follow ApHogee Keratin Reconstructor with some sort of deep conditioning treatment to avoid initial dryness.</li>
    <li> This product was ok, but I have gone back to my Dermo Organic masque. The smell on this was a little off as well, not a nice clean fresh smell at all, and it stuck after rinsing it out too!!</li>
    <li> I use this after every shampoo to rub into my scalp and let set while I&#x27;m answering my email.  Then I condition with my usual and rinse.  My scalp and hair look and feel 100 time better, I&#x27;ve stopped losing so much hair and see new hair growth.</li>
    <li> This product actually works! I have natural hair.  You have to read the instructions carefully and don&#x27;t let it say on your hair for no more than 5 minutes. Usually I go for 3 minutes.  At first I used it twice a month but you have to make sure you have  a good moisturizer to apply afterwards.  I will buy again, once I run out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and they spent the wrong item, I ask to return it and they ended up calling me! They told me I could keep the green tea  reconstructor(wrong item) and upgrade me to the 16oz. They did not upgrade me through. The product is working and every time I use it I see less and less breakage. I dont recommend the green tea because it make my hair hard but this does not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every week like it says. Left it on for the recommended amount of time and even longer amounts of time on separate weeks. I can&#x27;t tell anything different with my hair.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ever using and found that in the beginning it left my hair dry.  The next time I use it I will ensure that I apply a good moisturizer to my hair afterwards.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not as good as other conditioners such as the macadamia one.</li>
    <li> It is reasonably priced, but I did not noticed any significant difference. I preferred the Paul Mitchell system much better.</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff. I usually add it to the lower half of my hair, and let it sit as I finish my shower, then rinse it out. Smells great, and my hair just shines after using. Silky and soft.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft even though I need a relaxer something serious. It did not make my hair hard and I didn&#x27;t have to use a moisturising conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> I got my hair dyed a while ago, but little did I know that the stylist bleached my hair without telling me that I&#x27;d lost my curls! I was devastated. I took a chance on this product and oh my gosh. It&#x27;s been about three weeks. I use it once a week, every two weeks and my curls are bouncing back! Theyre not as curly as before, but they&#x27;re much better than the sad waves I had before. I&#x27;m sure within a few more treatments they&#x27;ll be back!</li>
    <li> This product is probably good for normal hair but my hair is very fine and thin and this acts like a conditioner which I can&#x27;t use on my hair because it makes it finer and thinner.  Even with my usual mousse, my hair won&#x27;t style right after using conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great Product that leaves here soft and stronger!</li>
    <li> Great product to save you some money ! I had great results very much like having it done by professionals. It also takes a lot less time as compared to visiting your hair salon. This is definitely one DIY product I would recommend to save you some money and have your hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
