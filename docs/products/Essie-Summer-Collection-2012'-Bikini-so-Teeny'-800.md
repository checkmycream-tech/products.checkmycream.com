      <li>Love this color.  </li>
      <li>I love this nail color.</li>
      <li>love love love this color.</li>
      <li>, it was more of an indigo.</li>
      <li>as many Essie shades are but not prohibitive from using it for at home mani and pedis.  </li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I treated myself :)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not creme, it is shimmer which was a surprise for me.&lt;br /&gt;Applies easily with no brush marks.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>Everything else was fine.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the product and the quality.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an experienced nail polish purchaser and paint my nails constantly -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a great summer color.</li>
      <li>So pretty!!</li>
      <li>brad new, love the price!</li>
      <li>Pairs pretty with a glitter top coat.</li>
      <li>Completely true to color from the picture you see.</li>
      <li>Loved this baby blue polish.  </li>
      <li>The picture truly does show the true color.  </li>
      <li>Mild sparkle</li>
      <li>This is a very pretty color.</li>
      <li>My new favorite color for summer.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and easy.</li>
      <li>This color is so so pretty!</li>
      <li>i love this color, it looks professionally done every time!</li>
      <li>So nice for the summer especially!</li>
      <li>Next time I will check inside of a cosmetic store to make sure I like the color.</li>
      <li>Love this blue.</li>
      <li>which I personally think is better.</li>
      <li>but its still a pretty color</li>
      <li>the color is more grey and takes like three coats</li>
      <li>The color is more of a purple hue other than a light blue, but it is still really pretty.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Only thing is that you need to put on 2 coats to get the color shown, but to me thats a given considering its a light color.</li>
      <li>Sparkles don&#x27;t really transfer to the nail</li>
      <li>Price is much cheaper than a store.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended seller!</li>
      <li>It is very purply &amp; that&#x27;s not what I wanted</li>
      <li>Such a pretty blue with a cute name.</li>
      <li>My daughter wanted this particular color</li>
      <li>the nail polish came very fast but it was not the light blue i expected</li>
      <li>still the most expensive nail polish i&#x27;ve bought, but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
      <li>Color is not the same as the picture it got here fast</li>
      <li>so you can shimmer without looking 10 years old.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very pretty with a little shimmer.</li>
      <li>There ain&#x27;t no other way to out it.</li>
      <li>Came in mail on time, but there was nail polish all on the sides of the bottle, obviously used and thinned out with nail polish remover, and sold for the same price of a new bottle that hadn&#x27;t been tampered with.</li>
      <li>There is a little bit of shimmer to it, but not so much and nothing that is off putting.</li>

<li> Product was just as expected.</li>
<li> Much lighter than china glazes secret periwinkle though....</li>
<li> because is EMPTY it.  </li>

<li> A little tricky to apply</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
<li> Omg this is WAY too expensive.</li>

The color is more of a purple hue other than a light blue, but it is still really pretty. I put two coats on and it looks really nice. I suggest getting this nail polish if you are looking for a good summer color!</li>
    <li> Omg this is WAY too expensive. Not the polish itself but the shipping and handling!!!! $25!!!! What do you say in that?so In total $30!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty color. It looked more lavender than it does in the picture..like a lavender periwinkle.

    <li> I wear this all the time!!!</li>
    <li> Great Color. I bought this for my daughter for a Christmas present and I am sure she will love it.</li>
    <li> Such a pretty blue with a cute name. Looks like a cornflower blue but lighter the Essie&#x27;s lapiz of luxury. Sparkles don&#x27;t really transfer to the nail but I&#x27;m not a shimmery nail polish kinda of girl anyway so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Came in mail on time, but there was nail polish all on the sides of the bottle, obviously used and thinned out with nail polish remover, and sold for the same price of a new bottle that hadn&#x27;t been tampered with.</li>
    <li> the nail polish came very fast but it was not the light blue i expected, it was more of an indigo. but its still a pretty color</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this particular color and I ordered it for her. I have to admit that it looks phenomenal. The periwinkle color is out of this world and looks elegant and appropriate with practically any outfit.</li>
    <li> This nail polish has already gotten me countless compliments. The shipping was fast and easy. I RECOMMEND for the trendy nail polish seekers! The color is very bright and perfect for spring/summer. Does not easily chip and lasts pretty long. I&#x27;m an experienced nail polish purchaser and paint my nails constantly - so - I know what makes a good nail polish good...and this is it!</li>
    <li> Asoft periwinkle color. I always get complements on the polish when I wear it. Its a unique color and great for the summer!</li>
    <li> This color is absolutely beautiful. There ain&#x27;t no other way to out it. Out of all my Essie polishes this one lasts an abnormal amount of time on my nails it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Love it for summer or winter.  Mild sparkle so you can shimmer without looking 10 years old.  This is my 2nd bottle and its because is EMPTY it.  Very few bottles do EMPTY, rather than it just get old and dry out.</li>
    <li> i love it! I get compliments on my nail color all the time.</li>
    <li> My new favorite color for summer.  To accomplish the look in the photo apply (3) coats.  I love this nail color.</li>
    <li> Color is not the same as the picture it got here fast and before the date posted the color is more grey and takes like three coats</li>
    <li> The exact color I wanted, and good quality! I actually found this at a Target but didn&#x27;t want to spend $9 on nail polish!  You get what you pay for on this one-I love it!</li>
    <li> Is not the same color in the picture. It is purple/blue. I was expecting a baby blue. Next time I will check inside of a cosmetic store to make sure I like the color. Everything else was fine. Price is much cheaper than a store.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not creme, it is shimmer which was a surprise for me.&lt;br /&gt;Applies easily with no brush marks.&lt;br /&gt;Good addition to my blue collection.</li>
