<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>this sent is the one I like the best.  </li>
      <li>This option, however, leaves no mark and smells great.</li>
      <li>It smells good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent by any means, which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>Like this stuff - protect and smells good.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, still a good scent for deodorant.</li>
      <li>And I refuse to buy the antiperspirant version of any kind.  </li>
      <li>either that or my husband is a really nice guy and hasn&#x27;t told me anything yet :)</li>
      <li>Many of us don&#x27;t want the Aluminum that goes along with the antiperspirant version.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love that scent.  </li>
      <li>Most stores don&#x27;t have the denali deodorant, its with the antiperspirant in it.</li>
      <li>I put it on before the gym and come out still smelling nice and fresh after.</li>
      <li>It smell so good, and definitely has a more unisex fragrance!  </li>
      <li>Scent isn&#x27;t strong like AXE products which is quite overpowering.</li>
      <li>Old Spice has been used in my family for years, and a standard for me, excellent fragrance, always refreshing !</li>
      <li>I have not been able to successfully find a &#x27;deodorant only&#x27; for women that works well for me.  </li>
      <li>This is such a great deal for deodorant.</li>
      <li>So, after many sniffs of various brands, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s, I have stumbled upon Old Spice Denali Deodorant and I LOVE it!!!  </li>
      <li>Great scented deodorant that does not leave white streaks on clothing,and is defiantly worth the price.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good enough to pass as cologne without being too heady in the office.</li>
      <li>I have enjoy the fresh scent of this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>The scent is pretty strong and it lasts for a while</li>
      <li>Love the scent but price is to high</li>
      <li>This smells fresh and keeps me fresh.</li>
      <li>So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn.</li>
      <li>Two seconds of gym time will make this deodorant sponge into your shirt like hot wax.  </li>
      <li>I have had a few girls comment how nice I smell after putting on a fresh coat of this stuff.</li>
      <li>Fast shipper ...</li>
      <li>Highly reccomended!</li>
      <li>Tried the white solid first, liked the smell, but all white solids end up staining my work shirt armpits.</li>
      <li>Luckily my friend happened to visit her local Kmart</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this scent for women...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend anyone to try this line.</li>
      <li>My husband has been using Old Spice Pure Sport &#x27;deodorant&#x27; for years</li>
      <li>Was looking for a new product to replace a clear solid right guard deodorant.  </li>
      <li>They are pretty similar.</li>
      <li>I hope that Old Spice does not discontinue the scents I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
      <li>Old Spice</li>
      <li>I used to only buy old spice&#x27;s ocean spray scent, but this is my new go to.</li>
      <li>Switched from their regular Old Spice Sports and haven&#x27;t gone back.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice subtle masculine note, I usually just put this on after the gym</li>
      <li>I purchased the entire wild collection, to determine which scents I would like to make a long term commitment to.</li>

    <li> Got this on a deal.  Switched from their regular Old Spice Sports and haven&#x27;t gone back.  This smells fresh and keeps me fresh.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else, wish it was a little cheaper</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal for deodorant. Usually, just a single stick retails for $4.99+ at Target or Duane Reade/Walgreens. Not only do I save money with subscribe and save, but I also can just forget about running out of deodorant.  The Denali scent is on the fresh/clean soapy side of the smell spectrum. It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent by any means, which is a good thing. It is a nice subtle masculine note, I usually just put this on after the gym and it&#x27;s good enough to pass as cologne without being too heady in the office.</li>
    <li> I purchased the entire wild collection, to determine which scents I would like to make a long term commitment to. So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn.

I hope that Old Spice does not discontinue the scents I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
    <li> this sent is the one I like the best.  I have had difficulty finding it in the stores as deodorant only</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Old Spice Pure Sport &#x27;deodorant&#x27; for years and I absolutely love that scent.  However, I thought it was a a bit too manly for me...definitely had that cologne smell to it.  I have not been able to successfully find a &#x27;deodorant only&#x27; for women that works well for me.  And I refuse to buy the antiperspirant version of any kind.  So, after many sniffs of various brands, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s, I have stumbled upon Old Spice Denali Deodorant and I LOVE it!!!  It smell so good, and definitely has a more unisex fragrance!  And it works!  At the end of the day, I don&#x27;t smell...either that or my husband is a really nice guy and hasn&#x27;t told me anything yet :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that frustrates me is that my local Target or even Walmart does not carry the &#x27;deodorant&#x27; only version.  Luckily my friend happened to visit her local Kmart and they happened to be there for under $4 for the 3oz. size!  I highly recommend this scent for women...just wish that Amazon would lower their price cause I paid $6.60 when I bought online through them.  A bit steep for one stick of deodorant.</li>
    <li> I used to only buy old spice&#x27;s ocean spray scent, but this is my new go to. They are pretty similar.</li>
    <li> Great scented deodorant that does not leave white streaks on clothing,and is defiantly worth the price.Highly recommend anyone to try this line.</li>
    <li> Old Spice has been used in my family for years, and a standard for me, excellent fragrance, always refreshing !</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that I was buying the antiperspirant solid not a gel. Nonetheless, still a good scent for deodorant.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments from this scent. The scent is pretty strong and it lasts for a while so no need spraying any cologne. Highly reccomended!</li>
    <li> I put it on before the gym and come out still smelling nice and fresh after. Scent isn&#x27;t strong like AXE products which is quite overpowering. I definitely prefer this over Mitchum and Gillette</li>
    <li> Most deodorants use this white powder that leaves ugly marks, or smell quite disgusting. This option, however, leaves no mark and smells great. This is the only one I&#x27;ll use...</li>
    <li> A previous scent (Matterhorn) caused some irritation but this version doesn&#x27;t give me any issues. It&#x27;s possible they use less of whatever was causing the irritation in this scent.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a new product to replace a clear solid right guard deodorant.  Tried the white solid first, liked the smell, but all white solids end up staining my work shirt armpits.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Old Spice is INSANE to discontinue it! My local grocery store still has a couple sticks but I&#x27;m just postponing the inevitable. Old Spice if you&#x27;re listening, please bring this back! Many of us don&#x27;t want the Aluminum that goes along with the antiperspirant version.</li>
    <li> Most stores don&#x27;t have the denali deodorant, its with the antiperspirant in it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipper ... Product performs as expected</li>
    <li> Love the scent but price is to high just saw at the store for $4.99 reg price</li>
    <li> I have enjoy the fresh scent of this deodorant.  It lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Like this stuff - protect and smells good. I have had a few girls comment how nice I smell after putting on a fresh coat of this stuff. Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> Two seconds of gym time will make this deodorant sponge into your shirt like hot wax.  It smells good. word</li>
