      <li>The packaging is different from true Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>First I apply Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue Tinted Hydrating Gel Cream Natural.  </li>
      <li>They took a picture up close to make it look like the normal size bare minerals, but it&#x27;s a travel size, and way too dark for fairly light skin for a tint of color.</li>
      <li>I am 40 years old</li>
      <li>I found that I could only use this in the summer, though, because it was a little too dark for my fair skin tone</li>
      <li>I have medium/fair uneven complexion and live in a hot and humid environment.  </li>
      <li>Bare Escentuals online can&#x27;t offer.</li>
      <li>I have been using this Tinted Hydrating Mineral Veil from Bare Escentuals for about a year.</li>
      <li>This was much darker than I expected.</li>
      <li>Bare Escentuals is all I use now.</li>
      <li>Its called tinted moisturizer and just phsicians power and almay smart shade power blush the other part of the time.</li>

    <li> They do not tell you what size it is. They took a picture up close to make it look like the normal size bare minerals, but it&#x27;s a travel size, and way too dark for fairly light skin for a tint of color. More like a blushnot finishing powder. Not happy.</li>
    <li> it isnt as light at the regular mineral veil but for me it worked great with my skin..im am fair to medium</li>
    <li> Love it. Great for summer. Gives skin a somewhat tanning effect.</li>
    <li> Very, very happy with this product.  I have medium/fair uneven complexion and live in a hot and humid environment.  First I apply Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue Tinted Hydrating Gel Cream Natural.  Then I use Kabuki Powder and Mineral Makeup Brush Round to apply this product.  Best combination I have found to date.</li>
    <li> Tints and hydrates too</li>
    <li> I have been using this Tinted Hydrating Mineral Veil from Bare Escentuals for about a year. I like the coverage it gives me. This is the first time using this vendor/seller. The product came sealed and the shipping was fast. I&#x27;ll be using this seller again if they continue to carry this product.</li>
    <li> I love this to set make-up without drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals is all I use now.</li>
    <li> I love the lightness of the product and it evens out my complexion.</li>
    <li> I use to get it at Nordstroms. Not any more. This saves me so much time. Love it especially Prime</li>
    <li> I love Bare Escentuals</li>
    <li> They did not say it was a trial size and I looked for it!  They did email me and more or less said it was my fault for assuming it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Always choose to purchase Bare Escentuals from Amazon prime because of the great shipping reliability Bare Escentuals online can&#x27;t offer.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff way better than the non tinted ones !! Works great over other make up brands too !!</li>
    <li> Have ordered this many times and not only is it a great product but it always arrives on time.</li>
    <li> I love Bare minerals products .</li>
    <li> Highly Recommend... I bought 3...</li>
    <li> My skin is medium to light. This was much darker than I expected. I may have to mix w/ a lighter color and just use in the summertime.</li>
    <li> Lighter color than the original tinted mineral veil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the tinted mineral veil for years now, and decided to try the hydrating formula since my skin tends to be a little dry in the winter. This may not make sense - but the hydrating formula is a lot more loose and almost too light. It seems that when I swirl it with my brush it disapears before it reaches my face. If I exhale too much when getting my brush ready, it goes all over the place. The coverage is pretty good - it works as a veil should - I just don&#x27;t prefer the composition of the product. I plan on going back to the regular tinted veil. Overall I love this brand though!</li>
    <li> Pleased, smell is a little funny but ok. Small size will travel well.</li>
    <li> Mineral veil adds a nice finish to face, that lasts all day.  Only 4 stars because the color is a tad orange. Maybe it would work better with a summer tan.</li>
    <li> I am a &amp;#34;bare escentuals&amp;#34; girl and have been for years. It never clogs my pores or makes me look as if I have caked on make-up. It is always worth the price for good make-up....I am 40 years old and now I use &amp;#34;alveeno&amp;#34;  bb creme part of the time as well..Its called tinted moisturizer and just phsicians power and almay smart shade power blush the other part of the time. I am a stay at home Mom and I try to use wisdom and find other ways to cut down costs.</li>
    <li> This was just as described.  Love the way this keeps your make up flawless all day.  Great finishing powder!  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love pretty much any Bare Escentuals products and this was no exception.  I found that I could only use this in the summer, though, because it was a little too dark for my fair skin tone (much more coverage than I was expecting).  I love the texture and feel of this product!</li>
    <li> Love the color love the feel of it</li>
    <li> Original Mineral Veil is one of my favorite beauty products of all time so I thought I&#x27;d try the new tinted version. Could this be a knockoff? The packaging is different from true Bare Minerals. It does stay on all day but a lot yellower than I expected. I have Asian skin w/yellow undertones so maybe it won&#x27;t look so yellow on somebody else. Anyway, I will not be buying this again.</li>
