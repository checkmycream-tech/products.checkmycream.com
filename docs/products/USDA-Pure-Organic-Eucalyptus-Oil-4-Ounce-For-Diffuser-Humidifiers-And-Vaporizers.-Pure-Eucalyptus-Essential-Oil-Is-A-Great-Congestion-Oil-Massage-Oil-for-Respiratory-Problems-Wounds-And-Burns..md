<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was suffering from the best oil collection for my body. i have used so many. But none of the oils was working good. My personal DR. suggested me to buy Eucalyptus Oil. After buying it i am feeling just awesome and i seem that the organic eucalyptus oil is some really great stuff. I use it for a few reasons. It works really well to clear up the congestion. It also works great when added to a household cleaner. It&#x27;s an amazing aromatherapy tool. I can sit down and inhale it while in a bubble bath and reading a book. It really relaxes me and helps to clear my head. I recommend this organic eucalyptus for any of these reasons because it&#x27;s worked well for my family. It is also always the best for less 20% off, Free Shipping on Any Order.</li>
    <li> One of the most interesting options I&amp;#34;ve tried for acne scars and my dandruff problem. I applied the oil directly to my skin, and was able to feel a cooling effect. Over time, I saw a return to normal. Eucalyptus is an interesting scene overall, which is one of my favorites. This one is strong, and it is concentrated to the point where you&#x27;re going to feel a slight tingle when applied correctly. I have recommended this to my friends, and family, and they too have seen the benefit. This is a good oil for anti-inflammatory skin issues, and has a very compelling scent. I love the smell of Eucalyptus leaves anyways, but this really brings out that scent to me, I love it. This is a great oil to use for skin care, which is why I used it, but there are so many other options to consider this for. A great buy.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the BEST Eucalyptus Oil I have used.  I have put eucalyptus oil on my chest at night for a few years, every night.  It keeps my sinuses clear and my allergies at bay.  I swear by it, but I wasn&#x27;t picky about the brand, just using whatever was on sale at my local Lassens.  Then I tried this, and it&#x27;s organic, which makes me SO happy, and it&#x27;s fabulous.  The smell is amazing (again, I love eucalyptus smell), and it works wonderfully for me.  It does not irritate my skin at all and I use the dropper that it came in to get the exact amount I want.  This is a pretty big bottle for oil, so I use it liberally and it will last me a few months for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions about the product, just send me a note.  I received this product in exchange for a review, and I&#x27;m so happy I did.  It keeps my sinuses clear all night!</li>
    <li> Great, large size Organic Eucalyptus oil!  We purchased&lt;br /&gt;this oil in a promotion for testing and review.  I have asthma,&lt;br /&gt;so whenever my chest starts feeling a little tight, I will use&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus oil in a diffuser, before grabbing my rescue inhaler.&lt;br /&gt;Most times, I don&#x27;t need to use a rescue inhaler at all when&lt;br /&gt;using Eucalyptus.  This Eve Hansen brand is pure and organic,</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this organic eucalyptus oil. It is energizing, refreshing and cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in the upper Midwest and endure many long, cold months of harsh winter. With that comes viruses, germs and illnesses that are passed around at school, work and home. Harsh chemical treatments are not things we like to use around our grandchildren, or really, anyone. When someone in our household gets a sinus infection, for example, we get our organic eucalyptus oil out. It works well at night in the essential oil diffuser or can be applied topically. Even just opening the bottle and inhaling it feels wonderful for your sinuses and can help to open nasal passages.</li>
    <li> I have nothing negative to say about this eucalyptus oil. It works wonders and I feel very safe using it since it&#x27;s organic. Also, you see the effects of this oil very quickly and it lasts for a lot longer than you would expect. I would recommend this oil to anyone who needs it. It&#x27;s a great price so get on it!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because my sister and and I are always sick, and I thought this might help us... I was right. My sister has a lot of unexplained respiratory problems (she went to an allergy specialist and an ORL but nothing was found). She is always all blocked in the sinuses. Turns out that this really helped her. She does baths with it (puts her face above a bol of hot water with the oil in it) and it helps clear her nose up. I for myself decides to try it to boost my immune system, as I ALWAYS get every viruses around. It works really well for that too, particularly for the flu and colds. I really like that it&#x27;s organic because I know I am not poisoning myself with chemicals. This is, overall, a very good price to quality ratio. I highly recommend it for anyone. There is so much to do with this little jewel, I think everyone can and will benefit from it.</li>
    <li> Got my eucalyptus oil the other day love this oil mix it with a carrier oil..my daughter also loves it in the shower when she has a cold..great product..</li>
    <li> I love using essential oils for cleaning, first aid, and everyday things around the house. This Eucalyptus oil in particular is amazing for cleaning, making cosmetics, soaps, and as a wonderful air freshener. The dropper included is very convenient for measuring, especially when using a diffuser. This is a high quality oil at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other uses include:&lt;br /&gt;Analgesic&lt;br /&gt;Antibacterial&lt;br /&gt;Anticatarrhal&lt;br /&gt;Anti-Infectious&lt;br /&gt;Anti-Inflammatory&lt;br /&gt;Antiviral&lt;br /&gt;Insecticidal&lt;br /&gt;Expectorant</li>
    <li> Love this eucalyptus oil. Great concentration.</li>
    <li> smells great, so many uses</li>
    <li> Eve Hansen is one of a handful of companies I trust to provide me with quality, pure essential oils at a great value. I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on therapeutic essential oils only to receive less than an ounce for a similar price. I&#x27;ve been doing that for 20 years. I no longer have to spend an arm and a leg on these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eucalyptus oil smells delicious and has so many medicinal uses. I&#x27;ve already used it to make a vapor rub type salve with beeswax and olive oil. I added some lavender and peppermint oil as well and have rubbed this salve on my chest when I&#x27;ve felt congested. I&#x27;ve used it as an inhaler and I plan on making a bug spray with it as well. I&#x27;ve also put a few drops into the tub right onto the floor and then took a shower. Just a few drops and your nasal passages will start to clear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 4 ounce bottle will last me longer than a year unless I combine it with lavender oil and make bar soaps, and even still it will last several months. The dropper makes it easy to dispense without wasting too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is on the higher end price wise of the 4 ounce essential oil products, but it&#x27;s definitely a good quality and worth it if you can afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased product review.</li>
    <li> Love the smell i have been using it as aromatherapy in my sons room and my room and the smell is so soothing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE EUCALYPTUS OIL!!!! i use this oil to make a salve to prevent or help with colds</li>
    <li> All I can say is AMAZING!!!! I love this oil, it smells so good. I have been using this oil for about 6 months now and I still love it. This organic oil has so many health benefits. I use it this on a daily basis for my arthritis pain and as an antibacterial.  I love putting a few drops in my humidifier because it makes my house smell like the rain forest.  It also helps my kids with their asthma, I just apply a small amount on a cotton ball and they sniff it throughout the day. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This eucalyptus oil smell amazing. I started using it as soon as I got it and had a stuffy nose... my sinuses seem clearer already and did I mention I love the smell?! The seller was great to buy from, definitely will get more when I run out</li>
    <li> I have used this in a diffusier and it helped a load with my boy&#x27;s allergies. He is congested and this helped him breathe better . A little goes a long way and I like it a lot. Will be buying more soon</li>
    <li> Gray scent. I use it in my shower steamer, very spa-ish. Fast ship, would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have sinus/allergy issues all year long. So I recently started using essential oils around my house to see if I could solve some of my issues.  I was given a chance to try the Eve Hansen USDA Organic Eucalyptus oil and I was very glad I did.  The scent immediately just makes me feel better.  I have been using this eucalyptus oil in my diffuser all the time.  My mother can tell a difference too.  She is almost always stopped up with head congestion and she feels like she can breathe better when she lets the diffuser run while she is taking a shower.  I like that there are no additives in this oil and that it comes with a dropper.  It makes it much easier to use the right amount and not waste any.  I would highly recommend the Eve Hansen USDA Organic Eucalyptus oil to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my unbiased review.

    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much I was going to spend on this bottle but I&#x27;m glad I did. I bough it to use in a diffuser for a pet who has been sick with kennel cough for a month!! Her cough came back with a vengeance and I just did not know what to do. I used it yesterday for an hour and again today and couldn&#x27;t believe it!!! My dogs cough improved significantly. She was coughing every 15 minutes and now at most 3 or 4 times in an hour!!! I used very little!! 5 drops in a cup+ of water!!!</li>
    <li> Great product with excellent customer service.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love Eucalyptus oil and its many great uses. I recently dropped a few drops of the oil in the corners of my shower. The steam from the shower activated the most amazing fragrance. Taking deep breaths feels like your lungs are being &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34;. Careful to not put drops where you would normally step in the shower for fear of slipping!! Note, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Amazing product it and really works on me, I am truly satisfied from its result and I get even better result after using it regularly. my every problem regarding acne is completely solved and I am truly thankful to this product .&lt;br /&gt;Main benefits of this product are that it gives better result in very short time and no side effect form it, so I can say this one is the best product in its class. I also tells my sister about its great result and she also using it, now at last I can only say once you all should try.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful, very pure scent, packaged beautifully with a glass dropper.&lt;br /&gt;I added a couple of drops of this to my diffuser and my house smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, reviewed for amztrader.</li>
    <li> I love eucalyptus oil and I been trying to find a bigger size than the ones you find in stores which are 1 oz and costs almost 10 dollars. I searched Amazon and I found this large bottle of organic pure eucalyptus oil. I dilute this oil in water to moisturize my hair and as a natural anti bug spray, and it works beautifully to keep my skin looking radiant and to keep away the bugs. I also use this oil as a natural anti bug repellent for my dog and it works to leave my dog&#x27;s fur soft and bug free. Furtheremore, this oil leaves me calm, collected and clear my sinuses. I find this oil makes a excellent addition to body wash. I use this oil in a natural black soap and it leaves my skin soft and smooth. Additionally this oil doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent, which I love, it&#x27;s has the wonderful smell of eucalyptus without it being too strong for your sinuses, and you don&#x27;t need a lot to get benefits from the oil. I only need a few drops to rub on my skin, or place in a water for a nice eucalyptus spray for skin, hair and any other needs that may present itself. I recommend this oil to anyone that loves eucalyptus oil and been looking for pure, organic eucalyptus oil in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> I use Eucalyptus oil in my diffuser to help control my granddaughter&#x27;s asthma and help her sleep better at night.  I also find it helps ease the swelling in my joints from arthritis when I soak in the tub with some drops added.  It sure smells pleasant as well, and it makes for a wonderful way to relax before bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Eucalyptus Oil is 100% pure, undiluted, steam distilled, and USDA Certified Organic. It comes in a 4 Oz. sized dark amber bottle to protect the oil from light degradation, and has both a bottle cap as well as a glass medicine dropper included which I like because the dropper lets me dispense exactly the number of drops I want to use without wasting any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to natural news, &amp;#34;Eucalyptus has a strong influence on breathing and is best known for its effective use against respiratory ailments of any nature including colds, catarrh, coughs, allergies, bronchitis, flu, throat infections, asthma, congestion, sinus problems, etc.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s also has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, and the native Aboriginals traditionally used it to treat fungal infections and skin wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have an aromatherapy diffuser you could put a pan of water on the stove to boil, add a few drops of Eucalyptus oil to the water, then remove the pan to a trivet, place a towel over your head and inhale the vapors to help clear your sinuses, airway, and congestion. You could also put some drops on a washcloth and place it in your shower so it infuses your shower with healing and relaxing vapors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a nice addition to your laundry to make clothes smell fresh, and it repels or kills mites, fleas, and ticks so you could spritz some around your dog&#x27;s bedding or add a few drops to the outside of their collar each week to naturally keep them free of pests. Eucalyptus Oil has many uses around the home. You can get lots of good ideas from Pinterest and Google and enjoy trying them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item at a discounted price for evaluation purposes, and am so glad I did because it&#x27;s so very useful and I love its scent.

    <li> Great quality Oil put a few drops in my hot bath and helps keep me breathing freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; Great natural remedy to combat respiratory problems (cold, cough, runny nose, sore throat, asthma, bronchitis and more); to treat wounds, burns &amp; cuts; and to rejuvenate the spirit, remove exhaustion and mental sluggishness. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Seems larger than 4 oz.  Love this glass jar and dropper.  Good product and seller. Used on my dog&#x27;s minor wound. He stopped licking it and then it healed quickly!</li>
    <li> Such a great deal for eucalyptus oil!  I use this topically to relieve chest congestion, and I plan to also try diffusing it when I&#x27;m feeling stuffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!  Great quality - just be sure to cut/dilute with a carrier oil if you plan to use it topically (i.e. on the skin).</li>
    <li> This Organic Eucalyptus oil is the best I have found yet.  It&#x27;s pure eucalyptus oil and always arrives fast and fresh. I started ordering from them once I could find eucalyptus oil in any local markets. The price is the best I came across yet.  I add a drop of eucalyptus oil to my mouthwash everyday to prevent plaque and gingivitis. It can also be used as a muscle relaxer and help heals wounds. It&#x27;s is as great for treating cuts and burns.</li>
    <li> This item should be a part of everyone&#x27;s medicne cabinet, it&#x27;s an amazing product with tons of benifets it can be used for almost anything as in the aid of a cough or cold by simply inhaling the vapor just a few drops needed in some warm water, it also helps with joint pains and can be used as a anticeptic.&lt;br /&gt;I luv this oil, I am sharing this with all my friends and family it works .</li>
    <li> Eucalyptus oil is the perfect remedy for anything ranging from a headache to muscular pain. Adding 2 drops of Eucalyptus oil in hot water with a towel over the head really speeds up the intake. Also, Eucalyptus essential oil takes away pain by spreading its warming effect on your skin, causing numbness on the affected areas and relieving pain. You can also add 2-3 drops of Eucalyptus oil into a warm bath to calm your aching muscles and nerves. It is also said that antibacterial qualities of this oil helps fight tooth decay which can cause bad breath and other oral problems. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic for all sorts of treatments and preventative measures. On the skin, it works as a natural sun protection, and it also repels mosquitoes. You can also use it in a vaporizer to help with respiratory problems..which is why I bought it. I&#x27;ve had an annoying persistent cough for a while and I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. Used it in boiling water and breathed the vapors twice a day. Really cleared up my breathing and opened up my lungs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also good for treating skin disorders, cuts, and you can even mix it with vodka to make an anti-cavity, antiseptic mouthwash. ;)</li>
    <li> Awesome and big bottle of eucalyptus oil! I have been using this essential oil for quite some time for my allergies and for headaches. This specific oil is just the same as the expensive one I usually buy. I love that this also comes packaged with a glass dropper. The bottle and dropper were packed extremely well. So well that I almost didn&#x27;t know that it was in the bubble wrap! I will definitely purchase my eucalyptus oil from them again once this bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly adding different essential oils and eucalyptus oil was definitely on my list. So when I was offered this Organic Eucalyptus Oil from Eve Hansen for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle.

Super excited about this new treasure. I definitely recommend this Organic Eucalyptus Oil from Eve Hansen for everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
