### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Who knows, maybe I can just soak some muslin cloths in the liquid version and get the best of both worlds.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re perfect for travelling</li>
      <li>I also found that using them to refresh my face after housework is also pleasant.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the liquid product.</li>
      <li>the most gorgeous !</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the wipes and the liquid too!  </li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m always looking for great makeup wipes that will easily remove mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved Bioderma for a while, but these wipes are fantastic!</li>
      <li>They come in handy when traveling.</li>
      <li>They stung my eyes and skin unlike the liquid which I love.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t get ALL of the heavier eye makeup off but do a respectable job of it.</li>
      <li>Has a nice clean smell and isn&#x27;t overdone with fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This is better than ANY other makeup remover and these packets are great for travel!</li>
      <li>Safe and comfortable in removing eye make-up as well as clean over-all</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please note that while the liquid version is fragrance free, these wipes are NOT.</li>
      <li>Smells good, but not as effective as other wipes for removing makeup.</li>
      <li>and I wish I&#x27;d purchased a case of them - they actually clean your face.</li>
      <li>love this product it takes everything off and is super gentle!</li>
      <li>I originally bought these wipes because I read in Lucky that Scarlett Johansson uses them.</li>
      <li>Ok Product but would be better if it were written in English.  </li>
      <li>I like very much this product !</li>
      <li>not the same results as the solution, I love the solution!</li>
      <li>use and love the liquid form of this makeup remover/cleanser, and it works beautifully on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I will be stocking up when i go to France next month :)</li>
      <li>If someone in the family where to look at the package, they would have no idea exactly what it is for.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time purchasing these wipes.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to fragrance, and so are many others with sensitive or rosacea skin, so I find it a huge downside that something that says its suited for sensitive skin has fragrance in</li>
      <li>I figured I&#x27;d try the wipes because I get home pretty late and would have loved the time saver.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and delicate.</li>
      <li>I expected them to be more saturated with liquid.</li>
      <li>I didnt feel like I had to wash my face after usung it like other most name brand wipes that will leave a filmy residue afterwards.  </li>
      <li>This left my skin feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>One towelette can clean my entire made-up face, and leave it feel fresh, never dry.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>can understand the changes in some of the other ingredients, but not why they would decide to add fragrance to an otherwise lovely formula for sensitive skin types.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really a sucker for all that</li>
      <li>Same price and lasts MUCH longer!</li>
      <li>but this is great when that is inconvenient.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin and use the liquid beware, these are not at all like the liquid.  </li>
      <li>They are not as wet as other make up remover wipes, but they work just fine.</li>
      <li>As far as I know, these aren&#x27;t sold in the States, so the only bummer is that I have to order them through Amazon and wait for them to arrive after I&#x27;ve ran out.  </li>
      <li>I would advise that you please look into the ingredients if you have sensitive skin and are trusting this to be the same formula as its liquid counterpart (especially given that the name and packaging is nearly identical to the bottled version).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are gentle, yet they do the job, a single wipe goes a long way.</li>
      <li>While these are soft to the touch and gentle on my face, they work no better than Rite Aide store brand.</li>

<li> They will NOT get my eye makeup off completely and leave smudges of black that literally just won&#x27;t wipe away.</li>

<li> Doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy or dry feeling after use.  </li>

<li> Disappointed, haven&#x27;t really used much because of lack of ingredients or identification on package.</li>
<li> They smell heavily perfumed and they burn my eyes, unlike the liquid version.</li>
<li> I use these when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face at night.</li>
<li> I have used the liquid bottle form of this product for a while and it works wonders at removing makeup (even heavy duty, really thick, waterproof mascara).</li>
<li> This makes it difficult to use properly or even what it is for.  </li>
<li> Just the thing to wipe off makeup at the end of a hard day.</li>
<li> I am very confused since the liquid product works SO well, but either way: buy the liquid form.</li>
<li> Disappointing, Scar Jo.</li>
<li> But that&#x27;s mostly bad planning and preparation on my part.</li>

I&#x27;m not really a sucker for all that (I work in media myself) but I&#x27;m always looking for great makeup wipes that will easily remove mascara.

    <li> I have these on hand at home and when I travel. Just the thing to wipe off makeup at the end of a hard day. I also found that using them to refresh my face after housework is also pleasant. They don&#x27;t get ALL of the heavier eye makeup off but do a respectable job of it.</li>
    <li> As advertised!!  I absolutely love the wipes and the liquid too!  Safe and comfortable in removing eye make-up as well as clean over-all face cleanser.</li>
    <li> love this product it takes everything off and is super gentle! I will be stocking up when i go to France next month :)</li>
    <li> I like very much this product !the most gorgeous !&lt;br /&gt; I can not do without it scans the sediments of makeup on my skin love it!</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing these wipes. I expected them to be more saturated with liquid. They are not as wet as other make up remover wipes, but they work just fine. They&#x27;re perfect for travelling so you don&#x27;t have to bring a bottle.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy or dry feeling after use.  This left my skin feeling clean.

    <li> I have used the liquid bottle form of this product for a while and it works wonders at removing makeup (even heavy duty, really thick, waterproof mascara). I decided to give the wipes a go, but I will not be purchasing them again. They will NOT get my eye makeup off completely and leave smudges of black that literally just won&#x27;t wipe away. I am very confused since the liquid product works SO well, but either way: buy the liquid form. Same price and lasts MUCH longer!</li>
    <li> Ok Product but would be better if it were written in English.  Totally in foreign language in reference/no English.  This makes it difficult to use properly or even what it is for.

    <li> I use these when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face at night. They remove all of my makeup and don&#x27;t leave any residue. Love them!</li>
    <li> I discovered these facial cleansing towelettes during a trip to France last year and I wish I&#x27;d purchased a case of them - they actually clean your face. What a concept! One towelette can clean my entire made-up face, and leave it feel fresh, never dry. Even with a lot of makeup on, these wipes do the job.</li>
    <li> I would advise that you please look into the ingredients if you have sensitive skin and are trusting this to be the same formula as its liquid counterpart (especially given that the name and packaging is nearly identical to the bottled version).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use and love the liquid form of this makeup remover/cleanser, and it works beautifully on my sensitive skin.

They smell heavily perfumed and they burn my eyes, unlike the liquid version. I am very sensitive to fragrance, and so are many others with sensitive or rosacea skin, so I find it a huge downside that something that says its suited for sensitive skin has fragrance in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liquid version ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Propylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Bromide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Towelette ingredients: Water (Aqua), Polysorbate 20, Pentylene Glycol, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Allantoin, Centrimonium Bromide, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can understand the changes in some of the other ingredients, but not why they would decide to add fragrance to an otherwise lovely formula for sensitive skin types. I&#x27;ll be sticking to the Crealine H20 Micelle solution. Who knows, maybe I can just soak some muslin cloths in the liquid version and get the best of both worlds.</li>
