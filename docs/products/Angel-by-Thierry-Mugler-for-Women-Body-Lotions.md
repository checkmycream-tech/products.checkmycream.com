    <li> Great smell. Actually better than the perfume. Cheaper than department stores. Real thing! Not a fake.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product it&#x27;s a must!!!! At one time this perfume was by invitation only .try it!!!</li>

    <li> Another knockoff. Packaging and product is not original Thierry Mugler. Creme has different consistency and actually smells bad.</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful, I was very pleased. But the seller could have declared a lower value of the product not taxed either to get here, as occurred. I am qualifying with five stars for the product, but the taxes that it had been high, it makes a new purchase is thought twice.</li>
    <li> If you are an &amp;#34;Angel &amp;#34; connoisseur than this is the begin and end of the affair that fully compliments the Eau du cologne and any pairing of &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; and/or &amp;#34;Angel Men&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> I am using this cream for years.Is my favorite and i love it.</li>
