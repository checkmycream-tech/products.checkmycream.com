      <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
      <li>This is the first winter that I have not had cracks at the corners of my fingernails that take forever to heal.  </li>
      <li>I thought, since this is a medical product I may not be able to get anymore ever again.  </li>
      <li>Makes your skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>My heels were cracked, I applied this at nite with a pair of socks and after only one night I could tell a huge difference, after a week my feet are soft and smooth again.  </li>
      <li>This stuff just works better than anything else I have tried for my really dry skin.  </li>

      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with rough skin.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty heavy cream.  </li>
      <li>So far we have not gotten into the dry winter season but the lotion is keeping my skin from cracking.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This should be called Sween 24K Gold Cream. I discovered Sween 24 when my sister was in the hospital in NC of &#x27;09. She gave me some of this cream and I took it home with me to NY.  I didn&#x27;t use it until this winter (2010).  Normally, every year when the temperature drops below 40 degrees the inside of my hands crack and bleed where my fingers bend.  I have tried almost every cream on the market like Eucerin, Aquafor and so many others and they just did not help me.  I had this stashed away in my suitcase and tried it. It impressed me from day one.    I can wash my hands several times a day and still not have to reapply it and my hands stay crack free and more importantly, blood free.  My hands feel and look normal, like when I was a child.  They are soft and pretty.    I panicked when I was about to run out. I thought, since this is a medical product I may not be able to get anymore ever again.  When I found it on the internet, I was so happy.  This is something that I will use forever and ever.  It&#x27;s the best product for dry, cracked, bleeding hands.  I have yet to try it on my dry cracked feet, but that is next.  For now, I am just so happy with my beautiful hands.  It almost feels as if the clock was turned back on my hands.</li>
    <li> There was a small tube of this moisturizer in a hygiene bucket from the hospital.  Took it home without trying it and later threw it in my purse.  I&#x27;d never seen this brand in the store and thought it was probably an off brand of so-so quality.  Boy was I wrong!  This moisturizer is head and shoulders better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  (I think I&#x27;ve probably tried just about every well-known moisturizer on the market.)  It strikes the right balance - excellent moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you&#x27;ve got a coat of grease on your skin.</li>
    <li> Used it on my face and neck during and after radiation treatments.  Really helped to get my skin back in good condition.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this  stuff.  The 6% dimethicone really softens and protects your rough skin all day long.  I use it on my elbows, hand and heels.  My heels were cracked, I applied this at nite with a pair of socks and after only one night I could tell a huge difference, after a week my feet are soft and smooth again.  I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with rough skin.  I do not know of an another product that contains 6% dimethicone.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  SOOTHING LOTION THAT TAKES AWAY THE ITCH AND LEAVES SKIN SOFT AND SMOOTH!  IT IS JUST THE LOTION THAT WE NEEDED FOR COMFORTABLE SKIN!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  This is the first winter that I have not had cracks at the corners of my fingernails that take forever to heal.  Also, no breaks in the skin of my knuckles that would crack and bleed from time to time!</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used!  Incredible.  LOVE  IT.  Will definitely order it again! I like the large size over the small size.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this stuff when I was at the hospital.  This stuff just works better than anything else I have tried for my really dry skin.  I cannot find it at the store so Amazon is where I go to get it.  My sample was the 3 oz size and it lasted over 6 months.  I think the 5 oz size will last a year or so.</li>
    <li> This is a must have in dry arid climates or if you use hand sanitizers constantly.  My Mom-in-law has had problems with cracked finger tips and they have healed nicely.  This comes out looking like vaseline with none of the stay greasy effect.  It stays with you for a long time almost like putting a silicone product on.  very effective!</li>
    <li> this is the best ever.  Makes your skin so soft and smooth.  You only need a little bit.  It lasts forever and your skin is wonderful the whole time using it.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about the Sween 24 cream because I have such dry skin. She gave me a sample and it felt really good so I ordered.  My arms and legs feel soft and silky now since I&#x27;ve been using this cream. I&#x27;ll definitely keep ordering this product. I also received the product within 2 to 3 days after ordering it, which was a wonderful surprise for me.  I usually have to wait 1 or 2 weeks before getting what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my grandaughter when she was in a body cast because of surgery to her hips.  She was a baby then and the diaper area would get terribly raw.  The sween cream helped out tremendously.  This was 11 years ago and I hadn&#x27;t been able to find the cream in any pharmacy.  When I saw it on line I was elated.  You can use this cream for many things, hands, feet and bad rasher on baby bottoms.</li>
    <li> Cant beat this cream. Same cream used in hospitals. That is why I bought it. Lasts all night. My whole family uses it.</li>
    <li> This is a great, long lasting moisturizer recommended by my hospital after my stay. I enjoyed the bottle the gave me so I ordered two more online. They sooth the itch and give relief.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product during a hospital stay.  I was so impressed I first ordered it direct from the manufacturer and then decided to see if I could get it through Amazon.  I could and have ordered several tubes.  I have given it to friends - all of whom have told me how much they like it.</li>
    <li> this product is very thick. It is for seriously dry skin. I will probably appreciate it more in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a heavy cream this is for you. I hesitate to call it a cream as it is more like a&lt;br /&gt;petroleum consistancy. I didn&#x27;t realize just how thick this cream is when I ordered it. Like I said, I will&lt;br /&gt;appreciate it more in the heart of winter.</li>
    <li> When I was in the hospital, they used this ointment on me!!  When I came home, I looked it up on Amazon, and I ordered several tubes...I will always have it on hand...I use it every day!!</li>
    <li> This product arrived in record time and it is great! It was there in one day.  When you need something like this it is nice to have it arrive so quickly.  I just love when that happens.  Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> This is pretty heavy cream.  I prefer a lighter cream, but my husband and son with their manly skin find this cream to hold up better.  The hospital that cared for my son uses this cream as well.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Use it everyday. Lasts for a long time!</li>
    <li> works great on the feet</li>
    <li> Winter in Maine can be severe and my skin suffers for it.  So far we have not gotten into the dry winter season but the lotion is keeping my skin from cracking.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin in the winter and nothing seemed to quench my epidermal dessert.  Nothing like getting changed in the winter and making it snow skinflakes all over your bedroom!  Now I actually feel like I could date somebody in the winter time without being afraid that I would leave behind enough skin cells for them to clone me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously this stuff is amazing!  But I have to warn you that I think it is too thick to wear in the summer.  When I wear it in the summer I get a heat rash because the thick moisturizer traps heat in my skin.  I need a more lightweight moisturizer in the summer that lets my skin breath.  But for the winter, I haven&#x27;t found anything better and it&#x27;s more than worth it&#x27;s price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you turn into an alligator every winter like me, you can say goodbye to your winter skinflakes and look forward to smooth moisturized skin even when there are snowflakes outside!!</li>
    <li> Great product that will enhance healing of skin breakdown. If you have dry, cracked, or skin breakdown that won&#x27;t heal this product provides the healing you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Work Really good. My husband uses it on his leg because of his condition they are super super dry. It worth the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer! I have very rough calloused feet and this actually makes them soft and smooth with regular use. It&#x27;s more of an ointment than a cream but nonetheless it&#x27;s awesome. I got samples of it in the hospital so you know it&#x27;s good stuff if they give it out in the hospital</li>
    <li> Recommended by the caregivers at the hospital and they were spot on.  Great product!  Longlasting and heals rashes, body blemishes, etc...</li>
    <li> I recommended to everyone</li>
