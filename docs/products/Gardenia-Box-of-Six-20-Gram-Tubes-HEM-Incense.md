      <li>I could see mixing this scent with something like jasmine blossom or maybe Ylang-Ylang and loving it even more.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased that the scent was not so over powering or sweet that it smoked you out of the room!</li>
      <li>HEM has proven to be my regular incense provider, and Gardenia and Frangipanni are pleasant surprises to add to a great product line.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find them available in bulk on Amazon at a much better price!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the way these smell.  </li>
      <li>certainly a favorite.</li>
      <li>The gardenia was a refreshing scent just like the flower</li>
      <li>I have been buying Hem incense for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>shipper was prompt and the package was wrapped appropriately &amp; arrived undamaged.</li>
      <li>Very flowery but still very nice.</li>
      <li>Very clean scent</li>
      <li>They smell pretty good and the smell lingers</li>
      <li>This will cover strong smell of &amp;#34;herb&amp;#34;, if that is what you need.</li>
      <li>Light smelling, not too strong.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised how good this smells</li>
      <li>but if I light 3 my 4 room flat smells great for an hour or maybe a bit longer.</li>
      <li>enjoy clean light scents.&lt;br /&gt;Hem</li>
      <li>but this one is so light and clean smelling</li>
      <li>This really does not smell like a gardenia plant but rather a strong cheap gardenia perfume.</li>
      <li>Clear refreshing uplifting scent.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the back of my throat, and it lingers nicely.</li>
      <li>Not unlike fresh gardenia soap.  </li>
      <li>My daughter thought the smell to powerful.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it really did smell like flowers (unless you were right on top of the burning stick).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not in my top ten but</li>
      <li>Gardenia Incense  smells like our Gardenia Bush after the sun has warmed it on a hot June afternoon.</li>
      <li>This was my first purchase of this scent and brand of incense.  </li>
      <li>a nice refreshing scent that is not at all overwhelming... not ideal if you are trying to cover other smells but doesnt give me a headache when i light it...</li>
      <li>If you like the scent of gardenia you will really like this.</li>
      <li>Normally light scents put me off, but this is definitely an exception.</li>
      <li>nice smell, but a bit too flimsy &amp; uneven</li>
      <li>nice fresh smell, not overly floral like I expected, after reading the other reviews decided to try it as I am an incense junkie....</li>
      <li>It had a relatively strong scent, so I placed it in the center of my house &amp; let it drift throughout.  </li>
      <li>very nice my mom and dad hate the most incense</li>
      <li>and I find it doesn&#x27;t expand very far</li>
      <li>used to get this exact brand and scent from a street vendor who recently stopped carrying it.  </li>
      <li>The smell clears your senses and even those who are not into incense have commented on the clear smell.</li>
      <li>Clear scent lingers after burning.</li>
      <li>can make it where you need to open a window to get smoke out not the smell which is not to much.</li>
      <li>This is not a heavy perfumy cloying scent.  </li>
      <li>Very smoky and burns very fast, less than a couple minutes.</li>
      <li>my husband actually likes it so that says a lot because normally he hates incense...</li>
      <li>I always have bad luck with jasmine as much as I love it, and thought Gardenia would be the same, but this fragrance is strong enough to linger.  </li>

    <li> I have several scents in this brand and it is excellent--good price as well</li>
    <li> Very smoky and burns very fast, less than a couple minutes. Gardenia scent very faint. A waste of money and will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the way these smell.  Friends come over and comment on how nice it is.  I like to give away the little boxes as gifts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get this exact brand and scent from a street vendor who recently stopped carrying it.  I was very excited to find them available in bulk on Amazon at a much better price!</li>
    <li> Clear refreshing uplifting scent.  Not unlike fresh gardenia soap.  This is not a heavy perfumy cloying scent.  Clear scent lingers after burning. A definite repurchase. The smell clears your senses and even those who are not into incense have commented on the clear smell.</li>
    <li> There is an underlinging smell with the gardina scent I cant figure out. They smell pretty good and the smell lingers but there is a lot of smoke with they are burning to the point 2-3 sticks in the same area can make it where you need to open a window to get smoke out not the smell which is not to much. I will not orders these again but it didnt hurt to try them, and i do like they are wrapped in sets of 20 so you dont have to open all at once.</li>
    <li> Light smelling, not too strong. Very nice!</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of this scent and brand of incense.  The stick burns for a relatively long period of time.  It had a relatively strong scent, so I placed it in the center of my house &amp; let it drift throughout.  The floral scent lingered in the house for several hours afterwards.  I was pleasantly surprised that it really did smell like flowers (unless you were right on top of the burning stick).  I will definitely purchase this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was prompt and the package was wrapped appropriately &amp; arrived undamaged.</li>
    <li> very nice my mom and dad hate the most incense but this one is so light and clean smelling they don&#x27;t mind it.  I find it nice as well and burns evenly and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a good deal of fragrances, and this one is tied for my all-time favorites.  I always have bad luck with jasmine as much as I love it, and thought Gardenia would be the same, but this fragrance is strong enough to linger.  HEM has proven to be my regular incense provider, and Gardenia and Frangipanni are pleasant surprises to add to a great product line.</li>
    <li> My daughter thought the smell to powerful.</li>
    <li> I like this scent a lot</li>
    <li> a nice refreshing scent that is not at all overwhelming... not ideal if you are trying to cover other smells but doesnt give me a headache when i light it...</li>
    <li> NOTHING TO SAY PERFECT FOR ME!</li>
    <li> Smells burnt. After smell is less than desireable</li>
    <li> Very clean scent but it doesn&#x27;t last and I find it doesn&#x27;t expand very far but if I light 3 my 4 room flat smells great for an hour or maybe a bit longer.</li>
    <li> nice fresh smell, not overly floral like I expected, after reading the other reviews decided to try it as I am an incense junkie....my husband actually likes it so that says a lot because normally he hates incense...</li>
    <li> nice smell, but a bit too flimsy &amp; uneven</li>
    <li> I was very pleased that the scent was not so over powering or sweet that it smoked you out of the room! The gardenia was a refreshing scent just like the flower I was very pleased. If you like the scent of gardenia you will really like this.</li>
    <li> Love it. My house smells like my Nana Shug&#x27;s parlor. It&#x27;s a beautiful thing.</li>
    <li> Normally light scents put me off, but this is definitely an exception. It&#x27;s not in my top ten but certainly a favorite. I would recommend this for a home that has a mix of preference... even, dare I say, people who like musk&#x27;s I can see liking this one. I could see mixing this scent with something like jasmine blossom or maybe Ylang-Ylang and loving it even more.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Hem incense for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy clean light scents.&lt;br /&gt;Hem Gardenia Incense  smells like our Gardenia Bush after the sun has warmed it on a hot June afternoon.</li>
    <li> 2 stars because I don&#x27;t like the smell.Expected smell something like gardenia,but, for my opinion,nothing like that.Waist of money.Do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fragrant but doesn&#x27;t smell like gardenia.</li>
    <li> Very flowery but still very nice. Like sticking your face in a bunch of flowers. Smells nice. Doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the back of my throat, and it lingers nicely.</li>
    <li> Nicely packed. Long burn. This really does not smell like a gardenia plant but rather a strong cheap gardenia perfume.This will cover strong smell of &amp;#34;herb&amp;#34;, if that is what you need.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how good this smells and I grow gardenia&#x27;s so it&#x27;s helping feel like I&#x27;m outside in my garden.</li>
