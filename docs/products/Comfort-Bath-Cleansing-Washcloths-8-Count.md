<li> I have trouble using showers that do not have grab bars.  </li>
<li> We use Comfort Bath Wahcloths for our handicapped daughter because a regular shower is too difficult to do every day.  </li>
<li> Making them all useless and obviously WORTHLESS  !!</li>

    <li> easy to slip in a bag-lunchbox-suitcase etc- this is a great item --</li>
    <li> They were not at all like the same product my husband used in the hospital.  The ones received from you were almost dry.</li>
    <li> Super durable, thick wash cloths that make you feel squeaky clean when you can&#x27;t make it to the shower. Taken on a long trip where showers were not an option but airport bathrooms were.

    <li> Top notch product. I used them in the hospital and am hooked for times at home. Bit pricey, but really a quality product. Try it,you&#x27;ll see&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I had rotator cuff surgery and these were perfect for a good &amp;#34;Bath&amp;#34;.  I will keep them on hand.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully moist and nicely scented bath cloths.</li>
    <li> I really like these cleansing cloths, first, because they are not heavily scented. They&#x27;re easy to use and leave the skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I have trouble using showers that do not have grab bars.  When I travel, I can&#x27;t always  get a room  with  handicapped showers.  This product was very handy to use  for those times.  It was gentle on the skin and did not  make my skin itch.</li>
    <li> Had seen this product used in hospitals - and it was perfect when a household member couldn&#x27;t use a tub or shower for a week.  Heat in the microwave and they provide a refreshing cleanse with no rinsing needed.  No oily residue is left on skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Easy to purchase.</li>
    <li> Needed these when my husband came home from hospital and needed sponge baths.  The cloths are thicker than another brand I purchased.</li>
    <li> The clothes are thick and moist, and you can cover a large area of your body with only one.  Just remember: don&#x27;t flush them!  Let them dry out and put them in the wastebasket.</li>
    <li> these are perfect!!!  for the in between times my husband gets to shower, very nice clean smell. Highly recommended for the &amp;#34;shut-ins&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Yep... just what I needed until I could get enough strength to get into the shower.</li>
    <li> We bought these to help clean our newborn while we were waiting for his cord to fall off. They are very easy to use, smell nice, and left our baby boy smelling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> For several years, I purchased \\&quot;Comfort Shields\\&quot; wipes by this same manufacturer, at Drugstore.com. When they suddenly doubled in price, Drugstore stopped carrying them! I frantically looked around for another source, and paid the price here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I thought I&#x27;d try these bath wipes, not expecting as much as the Shields. BUT, they are terrific!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, Shields still have their place, when I need a bit more skin lubrication, but Comfort Bath towels are great for everyday use! Love &#x27;em, Amazon, and I hope that YOU don&#x27;t drop them...</li>
    <li> Great refresher to use in between showers.  Saves your skin and keeps your friends.</li>
    <li> I became aware of these during my 25 days in the hospital.  They are thick (almost like a regular wash cloth) and can be warmed in the microwave and used all over the body.  They are great.  They cannot be flushed .... DO NOT FLUSH!  I will always have these on hand in my home, even when I no longer need them for my medical condition.  They are great to use on little ones for the messes they make on their hands and faces; and for other body parts as well.</li>
    <li> Very Upsetting!! When I opened the package I found all of the cloths were bone dry !! Making them all useless and obviously WORTHLESS  !!</li>
    <li> Very good product for between regular baths.</li>
    <li> We use Comfort Bath Wahcloths for our handicapped daughter because a regular shower is too difficult to do every day.  These do a good job, have a nice light scent, and leave her skin soft and in great condition.  They are so much neater and more convenient than soap and water on a washcloth.  They are well worth the price.</li>
