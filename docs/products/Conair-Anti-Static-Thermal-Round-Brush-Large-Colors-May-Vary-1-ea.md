      <li>and I believe I need more practice with the brush.</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>It Love</li>
      <li>So even tho the drying time is reduced by the design, having to make so many sections negates that in my case.  </li>
      <li>I ended up having to buy another brush that I could see in person to make sure the bristles were longer.</li>
      <li>I love the Conair Brush.</li>
      <li>I love everything about it:</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you just how pleased I am with this brush.  </li>
      <li>It is truly anti-static and a good size and comfortable fit in my hand.</li>
      <li>Size is more &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Its an okay brush</li>
      <li>Mine came in purple and I love it.</li>
      <li>Love it :)</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I got this for my wife and she love&#x27;s it.</li>
      <li>She has fine hair and static electricity is a problem.</li>
      <li>but it was relatively cheap and quality is ok.</li>
      <li>Overall, it was a good buy!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, yet well constructed and easy to manipulate</li>
      <li>This morning the rubber part got tangled with my fine hair</li>
      <li>and I got this because it was free for some reason on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in brush; feels comfortable in the hand.</li>
      <li>This brush is unbelievably cheap.</li>
      <li>One important thing: it is temperature resistant.</li>
      <li>and it is as good as the old one.  </li>
      <li>This one is holding on very well, and it&#x27;s truly perfect for straightening bangs without making them look strange.</li>
      <li>Hair drying and styling is quick AND easy.</li>
      <li>Quickly dries my fine hair, but the handle being rubber catches some hair and can pull out some hair.</li>
      <li>Success on Amazon.com!  </li>
      <li>nothing special to say here</li>
      <li>Really is anti static.  </li>
      <li>I love this brush, and it definitely is anti static and resolved that problem.</li>
      <li>It does the best job possible at giving me big beachy waves.</li>
      <li>Truthfully, I could not have asked or a better brush, especially considering the price.</li>
      <li>I use my brushes for an hour at a time, once a week, and many times, I&#x27;ve had them either burn because of the high power of my blow dryer, or just fall apart.</li>
      <li>It is good for use while blow drying long hair and not it getting tangled.</li>
      <li>the rubber handle, which is very easy to use and it does not slip out of your hand as you dry your hair, the size of the brush itself is great for curling the bangs and drying hair overall.</li>
      <li>Its a good brush, but does not live up to the claim of anti-static brush.</li>
      <li>The actual brush part is OK, but the rubber from the handles is peeling off - and catches my hair at times!  </li>
      <li>Great round brush for bobs.</li>
      <li>Which is great since my 12.00 Vidal Sassoon round brush practically melted with the heat from the blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I got it for me last year and  its nice however it does tend to take off  your hair when you brush your hair.</li>
      <li>perfect size for thin shoulder lenght hair.</li>
      <li>Although it smooth my hair pretty well with the blow dryer, it broke the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a small price to pay for a great deal.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Needs better glue and the two screws do not do anything because the screws are smaller than the holes that were there for added support I believe.</li>
      <li>The anti-static technology helps keep my hair smooth like I have professional salon at home.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>I used this brush once, and that was after much deliberation while holding it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle on my hair.</li>
      <li>It is very helpful when I&#x27;m drying my hair straight, holds the hair in place.</li>
      <li>and it really works and does the job.  </li>
      <li>so when I use it after shampooing and before rinsing and conditioning I didn&#x27;t feel it did much except foam.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It is also antistatic and it is extremely helpful with fine hair!</li>
      <li>I purchased this brush because my other one had seen better days.</li>
      <li>I use this brush to smooth out my hair when I blow it dry</li>
      <li>dries my hair with less static and frizz in record time</li>
      <li>It works better than some more expensive brushes I have used.</li>
      <li>I gave this two stars because although I think it is a great brush for shaping my hair with a blow dryer (design of bristles and material in bristle area), unfortunately the gel material on the handle is very sticky, gathers and rips my hair out.</li>
      <li>In just a few strokes, my hair was static.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t need lots of heat, or having the dryer held on it for more than a few seconds, to wave my hair.</li>
      <li>after a about 6 blow drys the screws seemed to melt right off, cant screw it back.</li>
      <li>I got this hair brush for a new haircut with bangs.</li>
      <li>Since I began trying to find a new haircut and style, I purchased this to use with a new dryer and straightener.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great brush for thermal drying your hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is unbelievably cheap. It sounds like it is tearing your hair when you use it. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> My hair gets caught in the handle.  Its an okay brush but you have to be very careful not to tear your hair as you brush.</li>
    <li> I got this hair brush for a new haircut with bangs. It is an amazing brush! I love everything about it: the rubber handle, which is very easy to use and it does not slip out of your hand as you dry your hair, the size of the brush itself is great for curling the bangs and drying hair overall. It is also antistatic and it is extremely helpful with fine hair! A definite buy!</li>
    <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in brush; feels comfortable in the hand. Size is more &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a large brush at all. Only half inch in diameter, should be called medium or small brush. Not good for people with long hair, because it&#x27;s not big enough</li>
    <li> Mine came in purple and I love it. I just cut my hair to a layered bob and with this brush I do not need any styling products to curl the ends and flatten the top, this does the trick! The bristles are not so painful on my scalp as other round brushes and I feel it actually gets out the tangles unlike some others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> Metal bristles, not usable by humans</li>
    <li> The size is right for long hair.  It is good for use while blow drying long hair and not it getting tangled.</li>
    <li> Truthfully, I could not have asked or a better brush, especially considering the price. I use my brushes for an hour at a time, once a week, and many times, I&#x27;ve had them either burn because of the high power of my blow dryer, or just fall apart. This one is holding on very well, and it&#x27;s truly perfect for straightening bangs without making them look strange. The only thing that I&#x27;m worried about is that some of the hair that comes off stays stuck in between the metal and rubber piece, I don&#x27;t mind, but I hope it won&#x27;t encourage the brush to fall apart.</li>
    <li> I gave this two stars because although I think it is a great brush for shaping my hair with a blow dryer (design of bristles and material in bristle area), unfortunately the gel material on the handle is very sticky, gathers and rips my hair out. I have tried using different techniques to avoid my hair gathering around the handle while blow drying my hair, but then I can&#x27;t use it to shape my hair. I find this frustrating because that was its advertised benefit. I wish that designers would actually test their products and gather feedback to improve their products before putting them on the market, and relying on PAID customer feedback to improve a product.</li>
    <li> I wish the product description would list the length of the bristles! The brush does everything it says it will, and the barrel size is great. But I have very long,thick hair &amp; a lot of it, so the bristles just aren&#x27;t long enough to reach thru it while trying to style it...unless I section my hair into very small amounts at a time. So even tho the drying time is reduced by the design, having to make so many sections negates that in my case.  I ended up having to buy another brush that I could see in person to make sure the bristles were longer.</li>
    <li> I love the Conair Brush. It is not too large for short hair. My hair dries quicker and has volume.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you just how pleased I am with this brush.  It&#x27;s lightweight, yet well constructed and easy to manipulate even if you have small hands like I do!  The bristles are great, hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in them and the VOLUME you end up with after drying is fabulous.  Hair drying and styling is quick AND easy. I&#x27;ve had alot of brushes over the years but nothing comes close to this one.  .... Love It Love It Love It!!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser used this brush while blow drying my hair and I like the style so I looked it up on amazon and bought the brush and it really works and does the job.  Its a little spikey on the head or to the touch but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This could have been just another brush in my daughter&#x27;s growing arsenal of brushes. She has fine hair and static electricity is a problem. This brush does a good job of curtailing the static electricity.</li>
    <li> The actual brush part is OK, but the rubber from the handles is peeling off - and catches my hair at times!  Time for a new brush.</li>
    <li> I decided to jump on this brush because of the price of it and mainly because I needed a new round brush. This is a pretty good size brush and seems like its of good quality too. Which is great since my 12.00 Vidal Sassoon round brush practically melted with the heat from the blow dryer. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The brush works well, however the bristles hurt a bit if you brush too hard.  Other brushes have little plastic gobs on the tips to fix this, but it isn&#x27;t too much of a problem.</li>
    <li> Great brush for blow drying hair! Creates body, increases drying time, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. The bristles are stiff and can be uncomfortable if run along the head using too much pressure. I use a separate brush to remove tangles.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t wrote gold my hair rigid enough.</li>
    <li> I like it.  My hair get dry quickly with the brush.</li>
    <li> Since I began trying to find a new haircut and style, I purchased this to use with a new dryer and straightener.  This brush really does help keep the fly aways away!</li>
    <li> nothing special to say here but it was relatively cheap and quality is ok. would buy again.  perfect size for thin shoulder lenght hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon reviewers for rating this excellent brush. I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked all over for the right brush for my long layered hair and finally found it. I&#x27;m so happy I got this. It does the best job possible at giving me big beachy waves. I air dry my long thick hair until it&#x27;s almost dry. I put a glob of Got2b Spiking Glue on it, then use this to make some waves in it. It looks gorgeous when I&#x27;m done. This doesn&#x27;t need lots of heat, or having the dryer held on it for more than a few seconds, to wave my hair. It&#x27;s well ventilated so the hot air goes through it, and the metal holds the heat on my hair just enough to make it wave the way I want. The Spiking Glue keeps those waves in until I wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m delighted with this brush. I can&#x27;t get this in my local stores so I&#x27;m so happy that I read the reviews for this and got it.</li>
    <li> The bristles are long enough for my thick hair. Handle is a good size for easy use. The anti-static technology helps keep my hair smooth like I have professional salon at home. Well made product.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, and it definitely is anti static and resolved that problem. BUT it snags my hair often. This morning the rubber part got tangled with my fine hair and I pulled it not knowing it had snagged and a few of my hairs were ripped out :(</li>
    <li> I got it for me last year and  its nice however it does tend to take off  your hair when you brush your hair.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she love&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> after a about 6 blow drys the screws seemed to melt right off, cant screw it back.</li>
    <li> It dries pritty well and does what it promises it will do... I just thought it was a bit wider.</li>
    <li> Great brush for thermal drying your hair.Love it :) Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this roundbrush! It is very helpful when I&#x27;m drying my hair straight, holds the hair in place.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
    <li> Brush is well made and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush because my other one had seen better days. It is truly anti-static and a good size and comfortable fit in my hand. My only complaint is the bristles are really hard and thin and scratchy. Otherwise a good choice. It&#x27;s growing on me. LOL</li>
    <li> It is a great hair brush.It helps a lot to strength the hair or make some waves. One important thing: it is temperature resistant.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush, not great, do better at Sally&#x27;s or your local drugstore.</li>
    <li> Out of all of the brushes I have purchased in my lifetime, this is the best one.&lt;br /&gt;My hair dries evenly, and the smoothness of my hair is so nice after a blow out with this brush</li>
    <li> This brush keeps my longish hair from tangles even while drying at the roots. This is a plus for my hair. It works better than some more expensive brushes I have used. My hair stylist who turned me on to thi brush. Love it. It also speeds up the drying process.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this brush. I bought it so I could start blow drying to get my volume instead of curling my hair. It works! The bristles are still all there, the handle and rubber grips have all held up. (I&#x27;ve had it for a long time now)and it&#x27;s gentle on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have never used a round brush before and I got this because it was free for some reason on Amazon. It does a good job. I am no expert and I believe I need more practice with the brush. I can definitely say that I don&#x27;t need to flat-iron my hair after I blow dry with this brush. Overall, it was a good buy!</li>
    <li> this is a nice brush  together with the Revlon RV544PKF  dries my hair with less static and frizz in record time</li>
    <li> I dropped it and the handle completely snapped off. Of course I chucked it thinking I couldn&#x27;t return it and now see the action is still available. :-/</li>
    <li> Great round brush for bobs.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I did not like the quality.</li>
    <li> This anti-static brush did exactly the opposite to my hair.  When I tried to use it to blow out my straight, fine but thick hair, not only did it seem like I stuck my finger in a socket but it added no volume or curl at the ends.  I threw this thing out.</li>
    <li> Its a good brush, but does not live up to the claim of anti-static brush. In just a few strokes, my hair was static.</li>
    <li> This brush is great.  Really is anti static.  I could not be happier with this item.  And definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price. The only drawback is the rubber gripper for your fingers...it will grab my hair while I&#x27;m turning it sometimes.  It&#x27;s a small price to pay for a great deal. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my vacation to Canada. I hated the brush and was mortified when I tried to use it. The bristles felt like needles! This garbage now sits in the dark corner of my closet. Worst brush ever!</li>
    <li> My wife had one of these brushes that had to be almost 20 years old.  There was and accident and the handle was broken off.  She looked high and low, but could not find a replacement in stores or salons.  Success on Amazon.com!  We bought the brush and it is as good as the old one.  I expect this one will last another 20, but I may add another to my next Amazon order; just in case.</li>
    <li> the bristles aren&#x27;t long enough to comb hair well, and it actually generates a ton of static electricity for me... I got this to make rolling waves with a blowdryer but it just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Best prices. Works for her.</li>
    <li> Although it smooth my hair pretty well with the blow dryer, it broke the first time I used it. The metal barrel came off of the plastic handle. Needs better glue and the two screws do not do anything because the screws are smaller than the holes that were there for added support I believe.</li>
    <li> I have damaged hair from coloring and the ends are like straw, so when I use it after shampooing and before rinsing and conditioning I didn&#x27;t feel it did much except foam.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m using it right so I have to stop in at a salon that sells it to get some info.</li>
    <li> Este producto lo compre el 24 de diciembre del 2012 y luego de casi 3 meses me informan que se extravió junto con otras cosas que venían en el paquete</li>
    <li> I use this brush to smooth out my hair when I blow it dry so I don&#x27;t have to flat iron it. This brush also gives my hair a little bump.</li>
    <li> just a typical round brush. cant complain. works well on my hair i have fine hair not to thin or thick.</li>
    <li> Bristles were too soft, I couldn&#x27;t use it to dry my hair at all and could barely brush my hair with it.</li>
    <li> my hair get caught in the gap between the handle and the brush itself. ANNOYING!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s your typical round brush...there is nothing different about it, i get the same result using a boar hair bristle brush</li>
    <li> I used this brush once, and that was after much deliberation while holding it. The bristles are like short, skinny nails that scrape, HARD, against your hair, if you get the nerve to use it for anything other than scrubbing the driveway with it.&lt;br /&gt;Ouch.</li>
    <li> Quickly dries my fine hair, but the handle being rubber catches some hair and can pull out some hair.</li>
