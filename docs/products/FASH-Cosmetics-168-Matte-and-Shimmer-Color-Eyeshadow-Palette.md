      <li>The packaging was very nice and secured, it came exactly on time!</li>
      <li>The colors are pigmented better than I thought, I buy makeup at drugstores and these colors show up better than those.</li>
      <li>Of course there will be colors used more often than others, for example in my palette</li>
      <li>im pleased with the product i received.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this set.</li>
      <li>if you love color</li>
      <li>I, for one, love this product.</li>
      <li>but they have more than doubled the amount of colors.</li>
      <li>this is the best it have more than my other palette</li>
      <li>Other than that great price for so many colors!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or anything, and seems to stay in place just fine.</li>
      <li>so i was looking for a cheap palette</li>
      <li>Overall I am satisfied with FASH&#x27;s 168 pallet, would order from them and amazon again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: great pigmentation, cheap and affordable prices, reasonable time on shipping, cover sheet and ribbon that separates trays..</li>
      <li>and there are exact color dupes in this pallet like a nice bronze reddish color that is like the exact mac dupe for &amp;#34;brownscript&amp;#34; which is like 25 dollars-</li>
      <li>The colors are full of pigmentation.</li>
      <li>, This came well before the estimated delivery date and was nicely insulated in bubble packaging so it came unharmed, the box looks sleek and professional grade.</li>
      <li>I love the colours and its very pigmented.</li>
      <li>I really like thee colors that this gives id like more matte than shimmer</li>
      <li>I would recommend this pallet for beginners, people that need more colors but don&#x27;t want to pay high prices and for people/students that want to experiment.</li>
      <li>Matte &amp; shimmer in so many shades Never a dull face for work ever again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was totally worth the money</li>
      <li>so if i find one that i really like its going to go probably pretty fast</li>
      <li>fast shipping</li>
      <li>my makeup much.</li>
      <li>There appears to be no broken pallets.</li>
      <li>The shadow came packaged very well.</li>
      <li>I really researched eyeshadow pallets before purchasing fash&#x27;s pallet.</li>
      <li>The matte colors are beautiful and the shimmer ones too ( the shimmer shows better with a primer or eyeshadow base)</li>
      <li>but this has a decent amount of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For those that are used to high grade cosmetics (Sephora ect) please keep in mind the price.</li>
      <li>Another thing to consider is the casing it came in, the plastic that holds the shadows is a little more flimsy than I would like.</li>
      <li>I wish there were a few more neutrals</li>
      <li>so I had every color I would ever need and could stop buying new colors when I needed them.</li>
      <li>It arrived within 2 days with amazon prime in great condition as it was packaged properly with bubble wrap and none of the eye shadows were broken during delivery</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so disappointed this was a gift for my best friend.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t do my makeup much at all, and got this simply</li>
      <li>I saw a lot of reviews that said the same thing, these cheap pallets all come from China and different company&#x27;s buy and sell on different websites.</li>
      <li>The colors are small, maybe the size of a penny or a dime, but that&#x27;s perfectly fine for me, as I do</li>
      <li>So far so good, there were comments on packaging and broken colors but that did not happen to me, although I ordered it with other products</li>
      <li>I am a beginner at colors other than neutrals so the size of the colors (will post pics) which are smaller than dime size, and the size of the pallet is the right size for me, but I was surprised on how small it was.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the colours and its very pigmented. great buy</li>
    <li> Ive never been big into make-up but lately ive started wearing it so i was looking for a cheap palette and i found this one. I really like thee colors that this gives id like more matte than shimmer but this has a decent amount of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my one dislike is that each color is only like a dime size so if i find one that i really like its going to go probably pretty fast so that sucks but its worth the price.</li>
    <li> The shadow came packaged very well. There appears to be no broken pallets. The colors are full of pigmentation. The only thing is that the colors are only dime size. This product is wonderful for the price!</li>
    <li> The colors are nice and nothing was broke when I received the product. I bought this as a birthday present and it&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t been used yet so can&#x27;t comment on how the colors will look when applied to skin.</li>
    <li> Birthday Gift to my sister.... She loves this eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> My package came the day it said it would be here but when I opened it a lot of the eye shadows were broken ! I&#x27;m so disappointed this was a gift for my best friend.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this set. Matte &amp; shimmer in so many shades Never a dull face for work ever again.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t dig pricey brand names so FASH has given me what I wanted</li>
    <li> I am giving this 4 stars ONLY because I have not used the shadows yet, This came well before the estimated delivery date and was nicely insulated in bubble packaging so it came unharmed, the box looks sleek and professional grade. The shadows themselves are a bit smaller than the coastal scents palette I have but they have more than doubled the amount of colors. I bought this as a gift for my step daughter who is just now beginning to get into make up styling. I can tell you that these palettes last FOREVER. When used with an eye primer a little goes a longggggg way. Of course there will be colors used more often than others, for example in my palette the browns, greens, pinks and purples are about half used. I purchased that palette approximately 3 years ago! For the price you cant beat that. For those that are used to high grade cosmetics (Sephora ect) please keep in mind the price.</li>
    <li> They is so many great colors! They work best with eye shadow primer. The only downside is that they are only about dime sized. Other than that great price for so many colors!</li>
    <li> this was a good buy im pleased with the product i received.This palette is of good quality eyeshadows  for a great price and i would recommend it to anyone.It arrived within 2 days with amazon prime in great condition as it was packaged properly with bubble wrap and none of the eye shadows were broken during delivery so im a very happy and satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> if you love color this is the best it have more than my other palette so i would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The packaging was very nice and secured, it came exactly on time! The colors are all there nothing was damaged.. The matte colors are beautiful and the shimmer ones too ( the shimmer shows better with a primer or eyeshadow base) It was totally worth the money and there are exact color dupes in this pallet like a nice bronze reddish color that is like the exact mac dupe for &amp;#34;brownscript&amp;#34; which is like 25 dollars-_ This product is amazing I can&#x27;t wait to wear these colors for prom</li>
    <li> my daughter loves the colors combination</li>
    <li> Love All the Colors and the Mix of Matte&#x27;s and Shimmers!!  I wish there were a few more neutrals but I&#x27;ve yet to not have the color I needed!! :D</li>
    <li> I really researched eyeshadow pallets before purchasing fash&#x27;s pallet. I saw a lot of reviews that said the same thing, these cheap pallets all come from China and different company&#x27;s buy and sell on different websites. So I decided to go ahead and buy the cheapest and give it a chance. So far so good, there were comments on packaging and broken colors but that did not happen to me, although I ordered it with other products so it had a bigger box to ship in. The box did come with bubble wrap surrounded by the pallet and air bags to fill in the empty space in the box. The colors are pigmented better than I thought, I buy makeup at drugstores and these colors show up better than those. I am a beginner at colors other than neutrals so the size of the colors (will post pics) which are smaller than dime size, and the size of the pallet is the right size for me, but I was surprised on how small it was. Another thing to consider is the casing it came in, the plastic that holds the shadows is a little more flimsy than I would like. I feel like i have to be really careful when handling it, because of dropping or breaking it. It does come with plastic film to cover the shadows from spreading, which i appreciate. Also the picture looks like there&#x27;s three separate pallets but it&#x27;s only two; again their plastic case is flimsy. I would recommend this pallet for beginners, people that need more colors but don&#x27;t want to pay high prices and for people/students that want to experiment. Overall I am satisfied with FASH&#x27;s 168 pallet, would order from them and amazon again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: great pigmentation, cheap and affordable prices, reasonable time on shipping, cover sheet and ribbon that separates trays..&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: smaller than realized, plastic casing is thinner than would like.</li>
    <li> Now, let me prerequisite this review with the warning that I am in no way a makeup expert. I don&#x27;t do my makeup much at all, and got this simply so I had every color I would ever need and could stop buying new colors when I needed them. I, for one, love this product. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or anything, and seems to stay in place just fine. The colors are small, maybe the size of a penny or a dime, but that&#x27;s perfectly fine for me, as I don&#x27;t so my makeup much.</li>
    <li> love all the colors! just perfect! fast shipping</li>
