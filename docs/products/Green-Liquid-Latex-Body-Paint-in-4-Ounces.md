      <li>and it is very easy to take off.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>It sure beats the heck outta using scotch tape, not to mention the time I save using this product instead of the tape.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;this actually works perfectly!</li>
      <li>I would love to love it if I would receive my order HELP</li>
      <li>Great product, covers very well.</li>

      <li>The product works good when you use it right.</li>
      <li>This applies easily, and stays until you peel it off.</li>

      <li>It goes on smoothly, dries quickly and always</li>

      <li>The prep lotion helps but not as much as you would think.</li>
      <li>If you have body hair, it tends to pull when you are ready to remove it.  </li>
      <li>Even the peach hairs you can&#x27;t see very well....</li>
      <li>; they sent me a new jar very quickly and this one is actually liquid.  </li>
      <li>&amp; it sure beats the price of any other &amp;#34;latex-y&amp;#34; product for cleaning up around the nails.</li>
      <li>its more like an aqua green.</li>
      <li>So the quality was fine, but it was very obviously a teal-ish (more blue than green) color.</li>
      <li>If I make any mistakes I can just peel off the latex leaving me to do less clean up.  </li>
      <li>so I figured &#x27;why not green?&#x27;</li>
      <li>I transferred it into an old polish bottle and apply it with the brush.</li>
      <li>I use it on my nails and it makes it easier to clean up my mess!</li>
      <li>The cost is so much cheaper than the REAL stuff to use for doing nail art not to mention the size of this jar will last me a long long time.  </li>
      <li>Just as expected, fast shipping</li>
      <li>Amazing product for someone that has a hard trouble keeping all the nail polish only on the nails!</li>

<li> Amazing product for someone that has a hard trouble keeping all the nail polish only on the nails!</li>
<li> and its a lot for the price compared to other liquid masks such as maskol, and Mr hobby stuff.</li>
<li> Once dry and nails are polished</li>
<li> I received mine today waste of money tell me how this is liquid, you can pull the entire contents of the jar out in a ball that is almost solid.    </li>
<li> This was difficult to use at first and you need a few days to practice with this type of makeup prior to the actual day of dress up.</li>
<li> I only use acrylic paints and its been hard to find a liquid mask that wont strip it.&lt;br</li>
<li> The packaging says green, and I thought that maybe it would dry green, but I needed it for a photo shoot &amp; it wasn&#x27;t at all what I was looking for.</li>
<li> I use a nail brush to coat skin around the nails (its a dark green color but lightens as it dries).</li>
<li> This color isn&#x27;t a grass green like I was hoping it was.</li>
<li> They said it froze in shipping the first time so beware of ordering when it&#x27;s very cold.</li>
<li> I brush on a thin layer around my nails.</li>
<li> It is very thin, I thought it would be thicker.</li>

    <li> Great product. I personally use this around my nails for easy clean up when doing nail art. I purchased the purple one before so I figured &#x27;why not green?&#x27; &amp; it sure beats the price of any other &amp;#34;latex-y&amp;#34; product for cleaning up around the nails. Fast delivery as well!</li>
    <li> Dressed up as the hulk and used this to paint arms, legs and face. Looked great, but removal was lengthy.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I use this when i want a perfect nail job. Works great! drys fast!</li>
    <li> Dyes your skin green haha</li>
    <li> This color isn&#x27;t a grass green like I was hoping it was. This was difficult to use at first and you need a few days to practice with this type of makeup prior to the actual day of dress up. I found out that areas that rub like the crook of your arm ends up rubbing off. I don&#x27;t know if that is because of user application error (I watched tons of YouTube videos trying to learn how to properly apply) or because of the product. I also tried adding colorants to this to tint the color like the You Tube videos said you could.</li>
    <li> I received mine today waste of money tell me how this is liquid, you can pull the entire contents of the jar out in a ball that is almost solid.    Update; they sent me a new jar very quickly and this one is actually liquid.  They said it froze in shipping the first time so beware of ordering when it&#x27;s very cold.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for nail art. Great!!</li>
    <li> Great product I actually use this liquid latex for when I&#x27;m polishing my nails.  I brush on a thin layer around my nails. If I make any mistakes I can just peel off the latex leaving me to do less clean up.  Love it</li>
    <li> it was represented to be a shade of Hulk green..not at all..disappointed.  &amp; there was no return label.  So Im out $30 on body paint I can&#x27;t use.  Buyer Beware....its more like an aqua green.</li>
    <li> For my purposes this product works wonderfully. I use it to protect the skin around my nails when doing nail art, stamping, and sponging. I transferred it into an old polish bottle and apply it with the brush. It goes on smoothly, dries quickly and always peels off in on piece making mani cleanup a breeze.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a latex barrier for nails except occasional skin staining</li>
    <li> Just as expected, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it on my nails and it makes it easier to clean up my mess!</li>
    <li> I would love to love it if I would receive my order HELP</li>
    <li> Works great!  Will definitely order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The product works good when you use it right. This was my first time using this product. It is very thin, I thought it would be thicker. The best brushes to use are the foam brushes that come in kits. If you really want a pain free experiance.......SHAVE ANYWHERE YOU PLAN ON PUTTING THIS. Even the peach hairs you can&#x27;t see very well....SHAVE THEM. The prep lotion helps but not as much as you would think. Great product, covers very well.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for someone that has a hard trouble keeping all the nail polish only on the nails! This is a very good product and does not leave residue and it is very easy to take off.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time.  I use this on my fingers when polishing my nails and it&#x27;s AWESOME! It sure beats the heck outta using scotch tape, not to mention the time I save using this product instead of the tape.  I use a nail brush to coat skin around the nails (its a dark green color but lightens as it dries). Once dry and nails are polished I peel this right off.  It&#x27;s definitely an excellent product to use.  The cost is so much cheaper than the REAL stuff to use for doing nail art not to mention the size of this jar will last me a long long time.  Well worth the money and great product!!!</li>
    <li> Still has an ammonia when it is liquid and can sting the eyes if you get the vapors too close, but it works great and is fine when it dries.</li>
    <li> Work well I use it around my nails for nail art stamping</li>
    <li> If you have body hair, it tends to pull when you are ready to remove it.  Comes off easy enough if it is not tangled in body hair.</li>
    <li> This is great for gradients, watermarbling, and stamping</li>
    <li> This applies easily, and stays until you peel it off. So the quality was fine, but it was very obviously a teal-ish (more blue than green) color.
