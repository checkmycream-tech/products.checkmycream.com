    <li> These are perfect for cleaning up makeup mishaps. The ends hold their shapes well, and don&#x27;t get lint in your eyes.</li>
    <li> The best way to remove eye makeup, especially mascara, eyeliner and long wearing eye shadow. They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; ...so no little pieces to irritate your eyes. Love them and have used them for years.</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter for applying makeup.  She really likes them.  They hold make up well and make application easy.</li>
    <li> These are so much better than regular Q Tips.  You can use one end for the details, and the other end to complete the job.  Both ends have plenty of cushion on them.  One end is pointed and the other end is round and flat.  These eye tees cover all your needs.  I highly recommend them.  Also, the price is great.</li>
    <li> These Eye Tees are better than the one sold at any of my local stores.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these for years at my local market until they disappeared 3 years ago. They are the best ones I have used. The cotton ends are compact so there are no fibers loose to poke me in the eye or get caught in my mascara. The fine tip works well to remove those little spots of mascara that end up under my bottom eyelashes. Pair this with Loreal oil free eye makeup remover for waterproof mascara and my eyes are bright and happy!</li>
    <li> VERY STIFF. Hard to apply makeup with. IT&#x27;s like really tightly packed cotton so nothing gets loaded correctly.....</li>
    <li> I use these when showing my clients how to correct their eye makeup mistakes. These have a great quality.  They have many uses in the Beauty  Industry.  I used another brand before these &amp; these save me money and allows me to stock up.</li>
    <li> Perfect item to keep on hand for makeup application.  Great for traveling as well as the packaging is nice and compact.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years.  They are great for makeup correcting.  Especially for eye liner and mascara touchup.  They don&#x27;t shred or get tangled with the tips next to them like other cotton swabs do.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for years and years and don&#x27;t think I could get my morning together without them.  No little pieces of cotton to find its way into my eye and strong enough to spread my eye shadow.  I keep a box at my office also and recommend them to all of my girlfriends.  Just a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Great product for eye makeup removal and touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;Also great for cleaning handguns.</li>
    <li> I have used these things every day for a long time now so I finally decided to buy them in bulk here. These are an absolute must have in anybody&#x27;s makeup kits and I literally never leave home without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each eye tee has two tips - one is pointed for precision and the other is round and slightly depressed for blending, I use the precision side to clean up my eyeliner for the perfect line and I use the other side to blend my eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work much better than the pointed Q-tips because they are not only shaped to have a finer point but are also more compressed so it doesn&#x27;t look is it&#x27;s shape easily. The only downside to this is that the precision end can feel kind of rough sometime, but I&#x27;ve been using these every day and it has never caused any issues with my sensitive eye area.</li>
    <li> Love these. They don&#x27;t leave stuff on your eyes if you use them for mascara mistakes. Strong and well made.</li>
    <li> Great for putting on make up</li>
    <li> love these and can&#x27;t find on the market easy</li>
    <li> I swear by this product for perfect eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Have used for many years at suggestion of my eye doctor.  Great product.  Never a concern that eye makeup applicator is not clean.  Use and throw out.</li>
    <li> Useful for so much more than makeup. Love these!</li>
    <li> I started using Eye Tees over a year ago and now I can&#x27;t do without them.  They make applying eye shadow a breeze.</li>
    <li> The product is great and I use it for craft work. These were not packed properly and every single box was cracked in pieces and broken with the applicators exposed to the elements. There is no way that I would be willing to use these for makeup or personal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY WITH THEM &amp; HAVE USED THEM FOR YEARS.</li>
