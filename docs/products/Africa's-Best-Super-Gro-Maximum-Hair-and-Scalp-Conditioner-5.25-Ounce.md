      <li>I feel this is the best product to repair any damage i may have and to allow  my hair to grow way past my shoulders again.</li>
      <li>But i recently came to the idea to continue using Africa&#x27;s Best again while my hair is natural b/c</li>
      <li>it has made my natural curls more bouncy and shiny, I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>i loved my hair and this was the only hair grease i used.</li>
      <li>So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>It was shiney, very soft, long, and had great movement-</li>
      <li>and they came pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>its been about 3 months now and its passed my shoulders right now</li>
      <li>I was super apprehensive about using a grease but found that it really does the trick when growing out your hair.</li>
      <li>I like  this  product  very much.  </li>
      <li>I can only get this via amazon.com, so I ordered three more which also saves money.</li>
      <li>and Blue Magic grease scalp and conditioner.</li>
      <li>at first I used waaay too much and my hair and scalp were so greasy</li>
      <li>Our adopted daughter uses this every day and really loves it.</li>
      <li>and i really did see a lot of growth since i started using this  and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve colored my  hair so much.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s sooooo soft, it&#x27;s growin pretty fast, and my hair&#x27;s not breaking so much.</li>
      <li>I am mostly Caucasian with a mix of a couple of other ethnicities.</li>
      <li>It soothes my dry scalp..and melts so easily while using it.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
      <li>I would suggest anyone with natural hair to purchase this product.</li>
      <li>Within 3 weeks the dandruff was gone and I have not had a problem since even my barber was surprised.  </li>
      <li>I twist and braid my natural hair all the time.</li>

      <li>I am a natural kinky haired individual and</li>
      <li>but when I use a tiny bit on my ends and the front of my scalp (due to dandruff) for a good period of time, I notice that my hair not only grows a little bit faster than usual but my hair feels so soft.</li>
      <li>So far, I have seen that a bit of my edges on the right side has slowly thickened up, meaning not so bald looking.  </li>
      <li>I accidentally used too much (using what was on the lid of the jar) and my hair was a greasy mess.  </li>

<li> I am a female of Hispanic ethnicity, I have VERY thin and fragile hair and because of that my hair was always dried and damaged.</li>
<li> This will make your hair a little greasy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I fully understand that the base is made out of petroleum and apparently it is bad for the scalp and hair.  Not to mention the parabens and what not.  But within the three weeks I have been using it, the worst thing I have experienced was that my scalp felt \\&quot;tender\\&quot; and sometimes my hair would be overly greasy.  I am a natural kinky haired individual and the reason why I purchased this product was that I was desperate to fill in some thin spots but at the moment pressed for cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for cheap (under two bucks at Wally World) and kind of incorporated into the LOC method.  So far, I have seen that a bit of my edges on the right side has slowly thickened up, meaning not so bald looking.  It has not increased growth in an noticeable way overall but I am okay with that.  A small amount goes a long way and I am not joking.  Just lightly coat the fingertips, not gathering a glop of product and apply to the parted section of the scalp and massage your scalp for about five minutes to make sure all of the scalp has been massaged.  With the amount I have used, I can forsee this jar lasting me about two years.  I accidentally used too much (using what was on the lid of the jar) and my hair was a greasy mess.  It took about two days for my hair and scalp to absorb it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of what to use to get rid of the petroleum buildup, I have my trusty Kinky Curly Come Clea shampoo since majority of sulfates-based shampoos irritate and dry out my scalp.  I tried it with a bottle of Nexxus shampooo and I had dandruff like you won&#x27;t believe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in years past helped my hair grow super long that and Blue Magic grease scalp and conditioner. I&#x27;ve returned to both products to attain my past hair growth. I&#x27;ve colored my  hair so much. I feel this is the best product to repair any damage i may have and to allow  my hair to grow way past my shoulders again. Not much grease is needed add a small amount to the tips of my fingers then massage into my scalp non greasy.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this product to improve her hair and scalp&#x27;s look.The smell is good,but it leaves your hair greasy and oily,looks like someone was frying potatoes on your head:)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this item,even after castor oil hair looks better.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and It feels great in my hair.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell and spreads well in my hair.</li>
    <li> im am an African American female. i would recommend this product because over the summer i cut my hair above my shoulders and i found this product in target and thought that i should try this and i needed some grease because i ran out of course. so i tried this and i really did see a lot of growth since i started using this  and its been about 3 months now and its passed my shoulders right now</li>
    <li> loved the way it smelled</li>
    <li> Back when i used to flat iron my hair i used this grease. I loved this stuff-when i used this my hair was at its most healthiest!! It was shiney, very soft, long, and had great movement-i loved my hair and this was the only hair grease i used. It will make your hair greasy so DO NOT use a lot, message the scalp to distribute the oil. But i no longer flat iron my hair b/c i heard it is so damaging (which my hair is.) But i recently came to the idea to continue using Africa&#x27;s Best again while my hair is natural b/c my hair is not growing at all and i want a little extra boast/help with my growing process.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, he loves this product. I have used it before and was very satisfied with it. I would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;to other people to try. Africa Best great job.</li>
    <li> Works great smells great</li>
    <li> I am a female of Hispanic ethnicity, I have VERY thin and fragile hair and because of that my hair was always dried and damaged. since using this conditioner my hair has become thicker, healthier, less frizzy and has grown faster. at first I used waaay too much and my hair and scalp were so greasy but I now learned to use a little bit and distribute well through out my hair. it has made my natural curls more bouncy and shiny, I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my hair! My hair is wavy, and prone to brittleness, dryness, and breakage. All I have to do it put some of this on the ends and it&#x27;s taken care of. I&#x27;m very impressed with this and I&#x27;ll buy more when I need to.</li>
    <li> Smells really really good and does the job. All in all i recommend this to anyone. I ordered 2 and they came pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> About 3 yrs ago I had dandruff pretty bad ,it would be all over my shirt. I happen to see it the shelf in Walmart. It was cheap so I figured I&#x27;d try it. Within 3 weeks the dandruff was gone and I have not had a problem since even my barber was surprised.  Great stuff.i</li>
    <li> I would suggest anyone with natural hair to purchase this product. I twist and braid my natural hair all the time. This product helps keep it moisturized and shiny. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it at once either to be effective. I also like that it has a pleasant smell and it&#x27;s not overbearing when hubby lays down next to me.</li>
    <li> This has petroletum (vaseline) as a base which made me angry at first because it&#x27;s not advertised that way. I remembered that my Mother used a vaseline based grease on my hair as a kid and it grew like weeds. It wasn&#x27;t until my Grandmother started perming my hair that it because damaged. Also I looked online &amp; other women said the same thing. Two scientists online also said that it&#x27;s a myth that vaseline clogs poors. They said that it actually helps hair and scalp. The product smells good. I can only get this via amazon.com, so I ordered three more which also saves money. You can&#x27;t put a lot of this in your hair &amp; you must wash your hair enough for it to work.</li>
    <li> Smells great and condition my hair.....</li>
    <li> I just got diagnosed with hypothyroidism and one of the major symptoms of it for me was hair breakage. Started using this after cutting most my hair off, and feel like it&#x27;s brought my hair back from the grave. it&#x27;s sooooo soft, it&#x27;s growin pretty fast, and my hair&#x27;s not breaking so much. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It made my hair look and feel really healthy. You don&#x27;t need a lot of this&lt;br /&gt;product to do the job. My hair feels so soft after using this. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This will make your hair a little greasy so I goes light on it with my hair....I use this every now and then, and I&#x27;m not going to lie to you but when I first started using this it made my hair grow SO LONG especially in the back, I don&#x27;t know if it was because of the chemicals or probably because it&#x27;s maximum strength but I couldn&#x27;t believe the growth. I would always wash my hair, oil my scalp with this and I would throw it in a ponytail all the time and I never blow dry my hair I always let it air dry and when I started using this I seen a total difference with my hair...this is one of the grease that I will ALWAYS use for my hair especially if I notice my hairs starting to fall out or break off. This smells so good and I love it!!</li>
    <li> It soothes my dry scalp..and melts so easily while using it. My hairs grows very fast, it helps to moisturize my scalp and it&#x27;s very light. Just use it lightly and massage into the scalp. Can be used daily I don&#x27;t get a build up. It&#x27;s my favorite scalp conditioner.</li>
    <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
    <li> When I couldnt find it in Walgreens or anywhere else it was bad news. My hair is dead without it. I&#x27;m an herblist and know the ingredients in it are  It is healthy for hair and scelp</li>
    <li> Our adopted daughter uses this every day and really loves it. Superior product!</li>
    <li> This stuff, has grown my hair and gives my hair that condition that I need daily, and this stuff smells great.</li>
    <li> I was super apprehensive about using a grease but found that it really does the trick when growing out your hair. This smells fabulous and  stays with you. It washes out pretty easy too! I bought this at walmart for under two dollars... I massage it into my scalp and apply it to the ends, braid my hair and leave it like that for 2-3 days until I wash it out. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this making my scalp itch, so that&#x27;s a big plus! This is a fairly new routine, but I definitely see results! My sister n law loved the scent and the results so much she bought a jar as well :) it had made my dry damaged hair healthy again!</li>
    <li> I am mostly Caucasian with a mix of a couple of other ethnicities.My hair texture is odd.I do not use this product all of the time due to the heaviness it makes my hair feel but when I use a tiny bit on my ends and the front of my scalp (due to dandruff) for a good period of time, I notice that my hair not only grows a little bit faster than usual but my hair feels so soft.If you are a racial mix of whatever my advice would be to use a tiny bit or our hair will get too greasy.I honestly love this product and have used it for years.</li>
    <li> this was a good product i washed once a week and kept my hair braided up at night my hair is still growing</li>
    <li> This is the best Greece to use in your hair because it make it stronger an soft and it also help you from getting dandro.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair daily.. I look super fly and it gets the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I smoove it in and sometimes when I&#x27;m feeling sassy, I let it ride like chaz dean</li>
    <li> I like applying this product to my scalp but not my hair. It smeels soooo good. It is too greasy to put on my hair. I don&#x27;t like how it feels when i leave it on my hair.I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like  this  product  very much.  It makes my hair easier  to  manage, I also like  the smell of it.</li>
    <li> Nice product but don&#x27;t smell so well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My scalp stays flake free longer. Smells wonderful. Not to heavy. Just right.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this product.  I&#x27;m not sure if it causes hair growth.  It is a great light oil for my hair.</li>
    <li> If you have damaged hair, then you can not go wrong with this product. I was skeptic abbout this item but I am happy I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair looking freshly done with a beautiful gloss.  Keeps my hair from getting too dry</li>
