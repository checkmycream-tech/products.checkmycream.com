      <li>It came with a free comb and wig cap.</li>
      <li>It stays in place exactly as it should be!!</li>

      <li>I needed a wig for comic con.</li>
      <li>Pretty wig</li>
      <li>However, the wig itself is nice - the length, cut (minus the exact sweep from left to right), and curls are as pictured.</li>
      <li>but you can&#x27;t see a real parting</li>
      <li>My MelodySusie wig arrived fast.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect it to look fabulous or last forever.  </li>
      <li>It looks like real hair.  </li>
      <li>Really glossy.</li>
      <li>I ordered a few more wigs for fun to wear out.  </li>
      <li>Very nice at 1st 3rd week wearing (I wear everyday to work)</li>
      <li>The bangs were long as shown, could easily be trimmed, but it was so manageable.  </li>
      <li>But other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>It is so realistic looking.  </li>
      <li>And I was able to blow dry it and style it on a low setting.</li>
      <li>It is very natural looking.</li>
      <li>This wig is pretty nice and didnt look too fake.</li>
      <li>It is bright orange, really fake shine and</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m actually quite surprised with how real this looks</li>
      <li>It has a soft natural feel as well.</li>
      <li>Way too big and very  fuzzy</li>
      <li>MY HUSBAND WENT WILD</li>
      <li>I was really surprised with how this wig turned out.</li>
      <li>AND THE TEXTURE WAS SOFT</li>
      <li>Its not messy and shiny like a lot of synthetic wigs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>natural looking, thick, and comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>After wearing a few times, short hairs under the bangs are becoming crinkled (possibly by heat/sweat).</li>
      <li>First of all i will say i was so skeptical in purchasing a cheap synthetic wig.</li>
      <li>The funny little comb that came with</li>

    <li> I NEVER have time to leave reviews.  But this wig was so amazing I absolutely had to.  It is so realistic looking.  It looks like real hair.  I purchased for a costume party and it was inexpensive so I didn&#x27;t expect it to look fabulous or last forever.  I purchased a fake ponytail at a beauty supply store w a friend that is super shiny and looks artificial next to this wig (which is why I never wore the ponytail).  The bangs were long as shown, could easily be trimmed, but it was so manageable.  I could brush it or use the wig comb.  It never slipped or moved even though I wasn&#x27;t used to long hair and snagged it on things several times. Lol!  Nobody recognized me!  Even people I see several times a week.  I loved it so much I ordered a few more wigs for fun to wear out.  I wish I could post a picture of how excellent it looked or how realistic it looks compared to the ponytail but the app won&#x27;t let me upload a photo.  Excellent item!</li>
    <li> Really glossy. So I washed it twice to see if it would look more natural. It was ok. And I was able to blow dry it and style it on a low setting. It does shed a lot. I was only using it for a costume but hate the glossy wigs out there. But not to bad for the price.</li>
    <li> The best wig ive ever har and really beautiful ....</li>
    <li> Way too big and very  fuzzy</li>
    <li> i REALLY LOVE THIS UNIT. WHEN I TRIED IT ON IT FIT PERFECTLY TO MY HEAD, NO PINS OR CLIPS TO KEEP IT IN PLACE. THE BANG FELL RIGHT IN PLACE AND THE TEXTURE WAS SOFT AND THE COLOR WAS JUST RIGHT. THE ENDS DO TANGLE A LITTLE BUT THEY BRUSH RIGHT OUT. I RECOMENT THIS WIG TO ANY AND EVERYBODY. NOTE: MY HUSBAND WENT WILD SAID WE DIDNT HAVE TO GO OUT WE COULD STAY IN. (WINK, WINK)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they could possibly mess up this horribly but they sent the complete wrong style and color wig. It is bright orange, really fake shine and not what I wanted at all. I order a different wig from them all the time and it always comes perfect. Don&#x27;t know what happened but was a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what was expected. it&#x27;s pretty much red and very thin. The layers are cute.. the actual wig crown is smaller than life itself.</li>
    <li> It started out great so many complaments, but once I started to have to brush it all the time it started to break down. Very nice at 1st 3rd week wearing (I wear everyday to work) and I looks fake now.</li>
    <li> The wig that arrived is nice, but not quite as the picture advertised. The sweeping bangs are not sweeping from the same side as in the picture and it&#x27;s not really possible to change that - this is important to me, but maybe not everyone. Also, it&#x27;s darker than I expected. The picture looks a bit lighter than my wig. However, the wig itself is nice - the length, cut (minus the exact sweep from left to right), and curls are as pictured.</li>
    <li> My MelodySusie wig arrived fast. It was too long for me so I had my beautician cut my wig and it looks great. It came with a free comb and wig cap. I would order from thus company again.</li>
    <li> This wig looks great the color is beautiful Feels soft and the curls look really nice and pretty.</li>
    <li> I just got my wig tonight and I&#x27;m actually quite surprised with how real this looks, I didn&#x27;t even have to cut the bangs.</li>
    <li> I wore this for a Halloween costume, so quality wasn&#x27;t terribly important. This wig is pretty nice and didnt look too fake. It&#x27;s also a little redder than the picture shows. It is way longer than I anticipated, but it&#x27;s nicely styled and has cute curls and bangs. The funny little comb that came with it worked okay, but the wig lost a lot of hair when I combed it. It has some ratty split ends now, but it&#x27;ll still be okay for costumes.</li>
    <li> Pretty wig but it&#x27;s unrealisitcally long and bottom heavy.  Had to trim it up a little.  Plus, where the bangs part from the side, it is obvious its a wig.  Great wig for a costume but not normal wear.</li>
    <li> I needed a wig for comic con. This wig looked great! It was very real looking. Take care of it though, because like all synthetic wigs it will get easily tangled. It is a bit long, but I got lots of compliments and people even thought I cut and colored my blonde hair.</li>
    <li> First of all i will say i was so skeptical in purchasing a cheap synthetic wig. I was just playing around on amazon looking threw all the wigs on here and stopped when i saw this picture. I really liked the style of it so i said what the heck it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to purchase it. When i got it came in good condition. No nots and tangles what so ever. I put it on and fell in love. It is very natural looking. I love the color of it especially the light reddish dye on the tips. I will be purchasing more from this seller :)</li>
    <li> I was really surprised with how this wig turned out. It&#x27;s fantastic. Its not messy and shiny like a lot of synthetic wigs.&lt;br /&gt;So natural looking, thick, and comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative, the bottom 3-4 inches in the back get a bit tangled. And its worse when I first put it on and take it off. Combing fixes though.&lt;br /&gt;Really glad with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The part/bangs are a little awkward. After wearing a few times, short hairs under the bangs are becoming crinkled (possibly by heat/sweat). I like the length, the texture, and the shape, and that it can be tightened. Very good for the price and very cute.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Fits well, not like cheap knockoffs. It stays in place exactly as it should be!! It has a soft natural feel as well.</li>
    <li> I just got my wig the quality is great however the color is not dark brown I&#x27;m a little sad about that But other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Its OK but you can&#x27;t see a real parting so it looks like a wig when wearing it. It will do till I find a better one.</li>
