<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this mirror. It will be great for traveling which I plan to do lots of. Well constructed.</li>
    <li> This is great, just fold it up and travel with what you are use to having at home.</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose for travel. At first I was not sure of the brightness, but makeup appears to be on my face in the right place.  Compact.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror for traveling. It is light weight but the mirror is large enough to see well and apply make up. I could also use it daily if I needed to. I had a smaller travel mirror but boy is it small and hard to use. The magnification mirror is what I like since I can see without my glasses to apply makeup.</li>
    <li> I can barely tell this is a lighted mirror.  If you&#x27;re needing good light, this is not the mirror for you,</li>
    <li> Wife thinks the separate LED lights are too bright. The last unit had a ring light which provided more even illumination.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS MIRROR FOR TRAVELING AND IT HAS WORKED OUT GREAT.  FOLDS UP TO A SMALL SIZE, BUT LARGE ENOUGH FOR APPLYING MAKEUP AND CHECKING THE BACK OF YOUR HAIR.  THIS WAS A GREAT PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. You have to be at the perfect angle to see yourself in focus on the magnified side so that is quite annoying but it certainly does show the really fine flaws in skin &amp; fine hairs to pluck. It should come with an ac adapter cuz im going through batteries like crazy.</li>
    <li> Looked good - gave it to a friend for Christmas.</li>
    <li> 12 magnification is way to large it become useless.  You have to put your face so close to the mirror to get focus that your hand hits the mirror when applying make up.  The light is great and the regular mirror image is great but I can&#x27;t see my eyes good enough to put make up on.  This would be perfect at a 3,4 or 5 magnification.  It was unfortunately useless for me, I will be returning.</li>
    <li> Led lights r not strong enough to really see ur face a 10x</li>
    <li> Natural light is great, adjustable height is really nice.  I do have to pick the mirror up, but for use as a as a travel mirror I am very pleased to find a lighted mirror with this level of magnification.</li>
    <li> This little travel mirror is a flimsy piece of junk.  It deserves a zero star rating, but that&#x27;s not an option. I have seen this mirror in stores for $24.99 and passed it up as too pricey.  At a hefty $69.99 it&#x27;s a rip off...guess I was fooled by Amazon...never again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and thought it was LED and it is not. Just lighted and not enough to really see. I just realized that they sent the wrong item. The box says 12x plus 1x lighted folding vanity mirror when I ordered Floxite 7504-12l 12x Led Lighted Folding Vanity and Travel Mirror, White, Frosted White (Purchased on 12/23/2010)  by Floxite</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife who loves it and says it is the best thing next to her clairsonic face scrubber</li>
    <li> This was a gift. She seemed to be happy with it.</li>
    <li> I found the 12x magnification to be far too strong, limiting what I could see because of having to be too close to the mirror.  I purchased it based more on the price (less than others) but will now look for a mirror strength that is more suitable.</li>
    <li> the lights around the mirror blinded me as i used it. i wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The 12x is so much u can&#x27;t focus</li>
    <li> Item was purchased with the intent to be portable because I do a lot of traveling and suitcase space is limited.  It met my need, however the light is pointless unless you are in a pitch black room.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for use when traveling and it was perfect.  The LED lights are bright and the magnification mirror was great as well.</li>
    <li> Works great as a travel mirror.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other magnified mirrors, but they all broke after a while from stupid incidences, like a little bump on the carpeting--PLUS, they didn&#x27;t magnify nearly well enough for me to see all my pores, which for some reason bothers me.  This mirror, on the other hand, withstood not only the wolverine-like state of my wayward brow hairs, but a few nudges off the table (onto carpeting).  I think my favourite part about this mirror is that it collapses into about the size of a medium piece of tupperware, which is pretty convenient for people who grow hair at the speed of light and need the mirror around, during the day.  It would also be really useful for travel, if you can package it so the mirror doesn&#x27;t shatter during the baggage handling.  My least favourite part would be the lighting.  I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be blindingly bright like I prefer, but I also didn&#x27;t imagine that the spread of the lighting would be so weird (it&#x27;s composed of several small bulbs instead of one round one).  Generally, if you need to see every detail of your face, the lights aren&#x27;t good enough.  BUT, it&#x27;s a great mirror and you should buy it anyway.  Great magnification.</li>
    <li> Good magnification, but I bought it mainly for the light.  It sucked, barely gave any light, ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I am going to be 65 soon and can&#x27;t use regular mirrors anymore to freshin up my face, so this is like a miracle.  Just the right size, the lighting is amazing and it is magnified so &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; can see where my problem areas are (and no one else can).  Love it.</li>
    <li> In love with the mirror, its a little small but works perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing light too&lt;br /&gt;Great for everyday use or to travel 👍</li>
    <li> Nice magnification, but the lighting is terrible. When I tried to use the mirror, my face made a shadow in the middle of the mirror. It&#x27;s impossible to see. I sent it back!  I would not recommend this mirror!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this mirror so she can use during our travels. It didn&#x27;t occurred to her that since it said travel, it was rather bulky and heavy to be fitted in her suitcase. When we travel, we prefer to travel light as possible and this was not it. This was a good size to be used at home or for road trips but definitely not for traveling light. She hasn&#x27;t used it yet but when she opened up the mirror, she thought the light was decent enough for her to do her makeup application but still, was displeased that it was so bulky for a travel size mirror. This is mostly going back.</li>
    <li> very nice. quality product  lighted both sides, ample soft light ,, no glare.  12x is perfect for fine details.. focuses in and large enough for full facial detail quick detail overview. flip side also lighted perfectly...</li>
    <li> This mirror is a great size for travel, compact, love the magnification and the lights are a big plus.  I&#x27;ve owned 3 and I&#x27;m pretty sure I will be giving this to own.  I&#x27;m always asked about where I got my mirror!  I do think Floxite should provide a cloth bag to carry and protect the mirrors.  The mirror is a winner!</li>
    <li> The light produced by the new led lights is not as even as the older flourescent style which I also have, but the magnification and flexibility are great. I already had the adapter so I didn&#x27;t have to go to the expense of purchasing a new one.This one didn&#x27;t come with the travel bag, but again I already have one. This is a great mirror for travelling and is ok when the power goes out and you have to use battery power.  Shipping and packaging were just fine. It arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> perfect small lighted travel magnifying mirror.  not expensive.  Appears to be worth every penny and I did a lot of searching for a mirror like this</li>
    <li> I travel a lot, and many hotel rooms do not have good lighting or a good space to put on your make up.  Carrying the mirror in my bag fixes that problem, and it&#x27;s a great mirror and light to boot.</li>
    <li> How did I manage without this??????</li>
    <li> This mirror is not a clear mirror .  It is hard to see in.  I really do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice travel mirror, but 12X was just too much for me. I use for everyday a non-portable 10X mirror that has a larger face, and thought this would be OK for travel. There was a big difference between the 10X and 12X, also because of the size of the mirror face.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  We travel a lot and she has been bringing a larger make up lighted mirror and wanted a more portable one.  Others that she had tried were not bright enough.  The LED lights are bright and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> As a mirror it is perfect but too heavy for travel</li>
    <li> too big not for travel as stated</li>
    <li> From all reviews I read on this mirror I decided to give as a gift. The person loves it</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for me.  The lights are yellow and it&#x27;s very hard to see details.  I need a mirror with white lights.</li>
    <li> the light on this mirror is definitely not bright enough and casts shadows on face, making it difficult for tweezing.</li>
    <li> Excellent vanity mirror.  I is what I need for travel and at home.  It is durable - survives my grandson looking at it - easy to use.</li>
    <li> I wish it was a little taller, but love it just the same. I really like how easily you can fold it up to go too.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for travel or even every day use. It folds nicely and is lightweight. The mirror pivots for close up or &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; view on the other side and both are lighted. The battery operated lights were bright enough for me in a dark room. There are also compartments in the base for storing small items. Thanks to the other reviewers that also liked the mirror, it was a great purchase for me.</li>
    <li> good for travel not daily use</li>
    <li> The light is terrible, at least compared to the identical mirror that plugs in..I have both and I really don&#x27;t like this.  I see that they no longer make the 12x, all you can get now are 9x.  This is a DO NOT BUY item, at least in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It works well for when I am plucking facial hairs (not that I have any) and for makeup application. The mirror adjusts to any angle and stays, the magnification side is strong enough to see everything you need to see and more, and the base is stable. The trays aren&#x27;t very useful - even if you pack this for travel they don&#x27;t hold much, maybe tweezers and some cotton buds. The LED lights are bright, but they aren&#x27;t enough - you need bright additional light in the room for makeup application and plucking. I wish it had a cord, but I use rechargeable batteries so it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. It does eat up batteries and the bulbs dim as the batteries get weaker, so if you are using traditional batteries you are going to be using lots of them to keep this thing bright. In fact, if you are going to get this mirror, I recommend that you go ahead and buy rechargeable batteries and a charger if you don&#x27;t already have them, or skip this purchase. All in all this is a good mirror, and although I am going to keep an eye out for a better one for my vanity and keep this one for travel, I am not in a big hurry because this is perfectly serviceable; it&#x27;s just not my holy grail mirror.</li>
    <li> I literally just received this two days ago &amp; fell in love with this mirror!!!  I wanted to order more right away!!!  Much to my despair, the price was almost double what I paid for it : (&lt;br /&gt;I was so distraught ... how could this mirror (plastic) be so much money now?  There are stainless steel mirrors cheaper?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Amazon ... make this affordable again!  It&#x27;s a plastic makeup mirror that&#x27;s perfect for college kids ... no cords, lightweight, folds away for easy storage, etc etc etc.  BUT, HOW CAN THEY BUY ONE AT THE CURRENT PRICE?</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of having this on a trip.  The overall quality, size, weight are all good.  12x seems excessive to me.  Big thing is it could use twice as many lights.</li>
    <li> Too small of a viewing area.  Can only see one eye  at a time.  Not good for makeup application.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these a year or so ago and loved it.  It was so bright and I took it everwhere.  I even bought one as a Christmas gift.  Mine broke where the mirrow attaches to the stem.  So I bought another and am so very disappointed.  I beleive they took out a bunch of the lights.  Any suggestions on a bright travel mirror?</li>
    <li> absolutely perfect.  bright enough without being too bright (although I don&#x27;t use it in a completely dark room).  magnifying side is more magnifying than most.  Control of position is much better than expected.  I&#x27;m getting a 2nd one.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: when it is folded up, a mirror side IS exposed!  So care needed to not break it.</li>
    <li> At first I was really excited about this travel mirror .it seemed to be just what I wanted but the more I used it the more I realized that I really couldn&#x27;t see-  The light is made up of little bulbs . I found myself looking for one for the spot of the mirror i was looking at. If the bulb had been a ring the lighting would be more even and I think this would have been a good travel mirror .Very dissapointed</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mirror for home and for travel. The best feature is the mirror can be adjusted to any angle and the height is also adjustable, a feature not found in most mirrors. The lighting is good and the magnification is perfect for me. Some mirrors have the magnified side so strong I can&#x27;t use it effectively, if at all. What is missing is a carrying case for packing and the electrical adapter should be included at no additional cost. The mirror is pricey enough to include those things.</li>
    <li> Took extra batteries just in case but lasted for two weeks, no problem.  I kept it in the packaging to protect it during travel.  Exactly what I wanted, albeit a little heavier than I expected but probably makes it more durable in the long run.</li>
    <li> Took this to Australia with me. Worked great in hotels with low light.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for travel yet but so far it seems to be what I was wanting in a travel mirror...</li>
    <li> Superb light; we have 2 of them and use them for our traveling; well worth the money.  Sure helps with my contacts also.</li>
    <li> For me, the magnification it too great.  But if you want to see what is in every pore, this is the mirror for you.</li>
    <li> I use this product for traveling &amp; was very happy with it&#x27;s performance. The magnification is a little too much for me, but I knew that when I bought it. I will get used to it.  I ordered the A/C adapter separately from the company, but wish it was offered along with the purchase of the mirror.</li>
    <li> I used this for a two week trip to Ecuador where I stayed in an apartment with terrible lighting in the bathroom.  This mirror was perfect for both the normal and close up needs - the magnifying mirror was perfect for close examination for wayward hairs.  A previous mirror I had magnified so much that it almost made me sick to use it.  The little trays in the base were also very helpful for organizing small make up items.  The mirror was easy to pack and pretty lightweight.  The light that it produces was also perfect.  I would definitely recommend buying this mirror</li>
    <li> I got so tired of trying to apply makeup on trips without my lighted, magnified home makeup mirror. This mirror was a great choice, so compact and well lit. Many of the travel mirrors I looked at were not lighted and we know how iffy the lighting can be in hotel bathrooms. This is a great product. The only drawback is the magnified side is REALLY powerfully magnified. You may see more than you want to.</li>
    <li> Mirror is as described  Missing electric adapter, however you can order from vendor.  Great price and good quality.  Folds up flat and is good for travel.</li>
    <li> I got this to help my wife put her contacts in while at our remote cabin.  She loves it!  The owners manual says to only use their adaptor but we use a standard 12 foot cord with a cigarette lighter plug to run it directly from our 12 volt battery.  This is a very high quality item.</li>
    <li> Great gift item. I ordered many of them. All gift recipients have appreciated. Would strongly recommend to others. I suggest the word quota for ratings be greatly shortened.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, keep it folded in a drawer and it is so easy to use. The lighting is  bright enough for my needs and I love the magnification side. It is enough for applying makeup and for anything close up that you need for face. I would definitely recommend this mirror. I travel quite a lot and think it could be a bit bulky but it is so handy to use that I may just take it in my carryon.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great for travel as it folds up very compactly.  It also is very bright and has good magnification and adjustability.  However, I have had it a few years now, and because of constantly bending the arm, the wiring has become weakened, and now I have to move it around just right to get it to light up.  Which is to say, if you only use it for trips, it will last a long time, but if you use it daily it will wear out after a few years.</li>
    <li> The magnification side showed my image upside down.  I had several other people try it with the same result.  When I called the company about this, I was told it was because of my vision, a ridiculous answer!</li>
    <li> This is a handy magnifying mirror, great for traveling when you NEED the 12X mag to put on  your makeup. It packs easily. The only negative is that the lighted mirror is really not enough light. But presumably you won&#x27;t be in a pitch black room when putting on makeup. You do need the alternative lighting to help really see your face. But for what it is and the fact that some of us NEED that high a mag to do us any good, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> needs more LED lights.</li>
    <li> Got here quick and is going to be perfect for travel or home ! Didn&#x27;t read the box too well when I received in the mail  thought  it was missing the adapter but it didn&#x27;t come with one ! Inside says you can buy one for $10. Bought this one at a good price so may order adapter.</li>
    <li> Not the brightest light but better then any hotel room light! Was pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I give this mirror a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10.  It is amazing and much, much better than my big-time stand-up mirror I purchased at Costco.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this on a trip.</li>
    <li> The construction of this mirror is fine. It swivels, it pivots, folds up nicely.  But the magnification side leaves me wanting. Even though it is lighted, it merely makes a ring of light around the mirror and then my face in the middle is dark. The reason I bought a lighted mirror is so that I could see my whole face. Also because of the concave nature of the design, It makes me go cross eyed.  So the only way I can use this mirror for make up and tweezing is to place one side of my face in front of the edge of the mirror where it is lighted and look with the other eye.  If I hadn&#x27;t thrown away the box already, I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Just what I wanted! !!</li>
    <li> Quality of mirror was not what I was expecting. Returned it.</li>
    <li> Wife used it on a Celebrity cruise ship and liked it so much we bought one on Amazon when we got home. She liked that so much we bought 4 more for Christmas presents for female members of the family and they love them. Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Mirror too small but it is my fault for not reading the measurments.</li>
    <li> This mirror is so great for plucking my eyebrows.  I  wish the mirror was bigger but I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Great clarity, storage area for tweezer, portable, adjustable neck, great lighting and magnification, easy to pack when traveling - what&#x27;s not to love? Good price too. I bought two for Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003NRYG4S Floxite 7504-12l 12x Led Lighted Folding Vanity and Travel Mirror, White, Frosted White]]</li>
    <li> This is perfect for travel. I use it with batteries but it is brighter with wall adapter. My notebook adapter is the same size that this uses so I didn&#x27;t have to but this extra. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Lights are too bright blinds when looking into. Delivered on time. It should have came with a travel case for protection.</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight mirror perfect for people who cant see without their glasses.  It is sturdy and fits well in luggage. It comes with batteries already loaded. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars due to size. I wanted this for travel. It would be great for your vanity. The lighting was good and size of mirror.</li>
    <li> I liked this mirror for the magnification, not so much the light.  With the electrical adapter it has much better lighting.  I used it for travel, alittle heavy and had to fashion a cover to protect the mirror but it works out fine.  My big problem is it broke after about two years of use (travel &amp; almost everyday at home).  The part where you tilt the mirror,  right below the mirror, is flimsy and broke so the mirror is unusable unless you hold the mirror itself, which you can&#x27;t if applying makeup.  I liked the mirror enough, though, to purchase another one and I&#x27;ll try to be more careful when adjusting it for use.</li>
    <li> Returned because the light was too bright and 10x is too much magnification for me.</li>
    <li> I love the compact folding design for travel!  The lights are just too dim. Older eyes need light and magnification to see!</li>
    <li> this is an awesome little make-up mirror.  this is my second one.  the first one broke at the swival within a year.  even, so, i liked it enough to try again.  i&#x27;ll be VERY gentle with this one.  i gave it only 4 stars because of the fragility.  other than that, it is a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Perfect for vacation. Easy to travel with and convenient. I&#x27;m thinking of second one for work.</li>
    <li> I have used the larger mirror product and liked. Enjoying the smaller one for travel!</li>
    <li> my wife looked everywhere for a travel mirror and this one really meets her needs of good vision and easy portability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always owned Floxite magnifying mirrors for putting on my make-up.  The older I&#x27;ve gotten, however, the more magnification I&#x27;ve needed without having to use my readers (just 54).  If you have a separate vanity table, this mirror will work perfectly for you although I wish the surface of the mirror itself - not counting the lights surrounding it - was a little larger.  There&#x27;s certainly no need for readers at this 15x ....fyi....you&#x27;ll see hair you never knew you had but thankfully, mine appears as fuzz since I&#x27;m a natural blonde.  My only negative comment would be they should have made this a convertible mirror, i.e.., one that could be hung on the wall as well.  I even tried drilling a hole into the plastic myself but I don&#x27;t recommend that.....more than likely you&#x27;ll crack the entire mirror.  Finding a mirror with the same magnification that you can hang is extremely difficult unless you want to opt for an expensive metal fold out and I just refused that option.  It will fill all your needs for applying makeup and doing your eyebrows but only if you have a place to sit down and use it from that position.  In any event, stay with Floxite and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Love the light and display area is very good but item is heavy for traveling.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  No distortion and it has storage space for eye drops and small tubes I need to keep track of.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this mirror to anyone that is pretty far sighted and wants to be able to see up close for makeup and plucking eyebrows and such.  Fast delivery, love it.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling. Love it. I did order the plugly for it.</li>
    <li> Love this lighted mirror-it is exactly what I  expected and I am very happy with it-great for travel too! I bought several for my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought it for travel purposes. IMO, it is way too large and bulky for that use so I decided to keep it to use in my bathroom. Just okay for that use but when I finally purchases the Zadro Next Generation LED Lighted Travel Mirror, Taupe Finish, 10X-1X, I realized the difference in lighting is huge. The Zadro has a much stronger light and is ideal for traveling. Don&#x27;t know what to do with this unit now. Updated 5/24/15 Turns out when I replaced the batteries the light it emits is bright enough. Still find it too large &amp; bulky for travel but works fine in my bathroom. Love that it is cordless.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I wanted.  The 1x side is great, but the 12x side makes it hard to see all of your face at once, and it is hard to adjust to see the area you want to work on.  The LED lights do not provide the circle of light as it appears on the box.  It is uneven, and distorts the area you are hoping to work on.  Will I keep it.  Yes.  Would I recommend it?  No.  Definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> The mirror gets 5 stars for the compact design and the way it adjusts and folds down.  But the lights are just not bright enough, though it is advertised as bright lights, and tthey look like they would be, they aren&#x27;t.  I have been using a lighted (incandescent) mirror for many years and it&#x27;s bright but I though the LED lights would be better but they just don&#x27;t cut it.  Otherwise, the mirror is great and I will use it for travel anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece to put in her make up trunk to use at the theater. It is really quite a nifty product. Light weight, compact and quite bright when lit. The mirror circumference is a little small but it&#x27;s the perfect size for a cramped dressing room.</li>
    <li> My research shows the dangers of fluorescent bulbs and one is contributing to cataracts!  This LED makeup light is the safest. It&#x27;s a little heavier than I thought for travel. The only way to get the adapter cord is by filling out the form that comes in the box along with a check for $10. No ordering on their website from what I could see. The adapter cord arrived promptly and is great!  I&#x27;m looking for a larger version just like this for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for traveling.</li>
    <li> The magnification on this mirror is great. I purchased it for travel, and even though some reviewers said it was a bit bulky, I chose it because the reviews for some of the smaller mirrors sounded a bit &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; regarding how much could be seen. I do have to agree that it is a bit bulkier than what I would normally want to pack, but I was really glad I had it with me on my recent trip to the UK. I used it for applying and removing makeup and just for checking for stray hairs, etc. Because it has a movable arm, I didn&#x27;t have to struggle with where to set it up to get the best view.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I expected. Good magnification, and light works well.  I like that there are little compartments in the base, so you can strore your tweezers in it and close it up.</li>
    <li> 14 GOING ON 15 YEAR OLD GRAND DAUGHTER WAS DELIGHTED.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror very much, but think it&#x27;s too pricey for it NOT to include the power cord. This is why I only have it 3 stars! I don&#x27;t want to use battery power all the time for use at home, only when I&#x27;m traveling. It says you can order the cord,  but I&#x27;m not willing to pay more for a cord when I&#x27;ve already spent so much for the mirror!</li>
    <li> I love the adjustable height and the collapsability. Perfect for contact lens or makeup application from a vanity.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!  It&#x27;s a little heavy, but worth it. It&#x27;s the brightest travel mirror I&#x27;ve found. The only downside is the need to pay an additional $15-ish for an AC adapter--and then wait for it to arrive. Wish they&#x27;d just include one in the box and/or make it part of the mirror.</li>
    <li> this LED mirror is not the replacement for the fluorescent bulb of the previous 12x lighted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;there is not enough light!  the product was disappointing. returned it.</li>
    <li> Way too short and too smal, mirror, doesnt flip both ways, makes hard to see whole face, lite was ok, but dont want to spend money on batteries. The seperate sold A/C adapter was ok. It helped. I ended up returning this one. Maybe could be good for traveling, small and fits nicely in the suitcase, if you want to see partial face each time you look.</li>
    <li> I love it fast shipping is great I use around the house and on vacation at the hotel i which they had it pink</li>
    <li> It is okay for what it is. Much smaller than I thought it would be and I agree with others that it needs a case or pouch for it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size with good lighting.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, good mirror lighting very good.</li>
    <li> This item is nice/good lighting, but I wish it came with the electrical chord. The cord is a separate item. The mirror could have been a little lighter in weight especially if your under a weight restriction when traveling.</li>
    <li> I would have done a video review on this beautiful mirror but my dog knocked the video camera 7 months ago and broke it! Anywho I LOVE IT! The product came within 2 days! i was shocked when my mother said hun, there is a package for you in the table they brought it in really early around 10 in the morning and i was aware of it till 2 p.m. so i was really happy the shipping was fast. And once i opened it my mother was all up on it shocked a all it showed in her face.(stuff that is not visible to the naked eye) And my best friend also loved it! I had a sleepover and she immediately had a facemask on her as soon as she saw herself in my mirror and she loved the lighting it really is LED and HIGH DEFF. Next story on the 3rd day, my father walkis into my room and i was doing my makeup on it, i leave to the restroom and find him smiling really big as hes poking his mustache staring into the mirror and then he goes to tell me i need to buy him one or let him borrow mine so he can trim his mustache cause he could see everything! I was very overwhelmed though, my mother keept coming to use it and she would turn the light on it like every 10 minutes I was getting annoyed because of that. But so far ive had it a week and a day and its shinning and well kept. If something ever happens to it im deff. buying it again! :) very satisfied with it. &lt;3</li>
    <li> Not  quite tall enough.</li>
    <li> Lighting is fair, mirror isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and it shows up all those nasty imperfections my vanity wants me to hide.</li>
    <li> I have a lovely stand plug in mirror by this company that I love but it&#x27;s much to large and heavy for travel. I purchased this one hoping the light would be equally  as good but it&#x27;s so dim and orange that it&#x27;s worthless as a lighted mirror for me. I am going to have to return it and see if I can find one with another company.</li>
    <li> Just received this overpriced item and see Amazon is now selling it $4 cheaper. I needed it too quickly to wait until I found one more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;The product is alright, I like the hard to find 12X, but very overpriced since it doesn&#x27;t even include the electric adaptor!&lt;br /&gt;WORSE:  unit&#x27;s light switch doesn&#x27;t stay &#x27;on&#x27; after second use. Will be returning!&lt;br /&gt;Changed 2 stars to 1 star because there isn&#x27;t 0.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Bought a second for a spare.</li>
    <li> I just returned from a trip and found it very workable.  The lighting and enlargement features were great.  I would have liked a protective carry case for it.  I worry it might break in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> Works great for my mom. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this in our stateroom on a cruise.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier to have been able to find it. The magnification is great and the light makes it so easy to use anywhere.  I never leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Love that it is battery operated but disappointed in the mirror image I feel it is a little distorted. It even throws your vision off for a second when you go back to looking in it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a present for my wife and to my disappointment the light did not work and the 12x zoom was to much for her eyes. It is small in my opinion to travel but I won&#x27;t recommend this product. I returned the product and bought the bigger 9x zoom with a decades power cord.</li>
    <li> Met all my needs, happy to have great travel mirror</li>
    <li> On the magnification side you can only see one eye at a time</li>
    <li> I really like this travel mirror.  I have had expensive ones before and I would replace them every year because of the hinges would break.  This one feels like it will last longer.  The light is bright enough.  I have used it with batteries and I bought the extra cord.  With fresh batteries it is nice and bright but as the batteries get weaker so does the light.</li>
    <li> I apparently didn&#x27;t need the 12x but it works well.</li>
    <li> Very poor lighting and the mirror connected to the stand was lose where it wud flip around if u didnt make sure u had it turned all the way.  I have had an floxide light for more than 10 yrs and it finally stop working.  This is y I wanted another one.  Major big mistake</li>
    <li> Loved it so much...I ordered more for gifts!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to take when traveling.  It is a much higher magnification than I use at home, but it worked great! The lights were bright and it folds to make traveling with it easy.  Be prepared though, with the higher magnification you will see things you never knew were there. :)</li>
    <li> Like it. I bought this mainly for travel. Only disappointment was that it didn&#x27;t include AC adapter. Luckily it&#x27;s a standard size and I was able to find one in my junk drawer that works with it.</li>
    <li> I like the design, but it broke the day I got it (the mirror detached from the arm. They handled it perfectly and gave me a refund, but the item itself was not quality.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest travel mirror ever if you need good light and magnification.  Works with batteries, so no bother with cords; and doesn&#x27;t take up much packing room. I love it so much I use it as my everyday mirror at home.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchase a replacement.  I am giving this model a second shot.  Although I really like this mirror, it has a design fault.  The plastic at the point where the mirror attaches to the stand is weak and eventually cracks and breaks off.  Once that happens, the mirror cannot stay up.</li>
    <li> Love it for travel....large magnification a little over the top but still love it</li>
    <li> I recently revamped my vanity area and installed new lighting and a new mirror, which I loved but missed the use of having a small vanity mirror that I could pull close when getting ready.  I&#x27;ve been using a $30 or so conair vanity mirror that I purchased from Target some years ago that worked for what I needed it for, but the cord got in the way all the time.  I gave it to my sister and ordered the Floxite folding vanithy mirror.  I love this thing!!  I use it with the batteries and it gives out more light than my old corded one (granted  the corded one was one of the cheapest I could find at the time that had a light).  It adjusts to any angle and folds up so nicely to put in my vanity drawer.  It fits my needs perfectly!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this to take on vacation in February 2013 - thought light would be useful in dark hotel rooms.&lt;br /&gt;Light not really that bright..&lt;br /&gt;Used it on a one week vacation, then packed it away in it&#x27;s original box and packing.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of March 2013 I took it on another trip and found that the lights won&#x27;t light at all - even with brand new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Now the return window is past and I have a no lighted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Save money just buy a mirror for $10 at CVS</li>
    <li> This a great travel mirror.  I have searched far and wide for a bright travel mirror and this one is by far the brightest.  For a travel mirror, this one wins hands down!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I have been looking for. The mirror is bright, works both on batteries and electricity, compact, which makes it great for traveling.</li>
