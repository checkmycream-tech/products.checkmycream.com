      <li>- I will be getting more.</li>
      <li>I love their soap and the lotion and the lip balm</li>
      <li>the description sounded convincing but it&#x27;s NOT.  </li>
      <li>this lotion is great feeling on the skin &amp; it smells fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Canus Goat&#x27;s milk lotion smells very clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>It has a nice clean soap smell too.  </li>
      <li>Very clean, not \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I discovered Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk products many years ago and it was love at first use!  </li>
      <li>I was encouraged to buy this from my mother in law, because she says it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell or anything.  </li>
      <li>The fragance is strong also.  </li>
      <li>One of the better lotions that is on the market and priced right also!</li>
      <li>I really do love this lotion, it is a big bottle, makes my skin feel great and the smell is light and clean.</li>
      <li>It is light, goes right into your skin, smells good and is easy to use in this large plunger bottle.</li>
      <li>I was so happy when I finally found it on Amazon.com</li>
      <li>the lotion goes on smooth &amp; leaves no residue.  </li>
      <li>She once came along to a gig 200 miles away because this company was a sponsor and was giving out free samples.  </li>
      <li>While the \\&quot;butter\\&quot; is too oily and rich (would be great for really dry skin)</li>
      <li>It is a nice product, not heavy or greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>the lotion is light, soaks in right away--</li>
      <li>For me, though, the main thing is the fragrance--I love it.  </li>
      <li>It is a tremendous body lotion with no scent and is not greasy</li>
      <li>I am much happier with this product (larger container/less packaging - and don&#x27;t forget that handy pump!).</li>
      <li>My whole family like it because it does not evaporate easily and scent does not clash with our perfume.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good moisturizer that could help my dry skin hydrate while not leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>the kind of thing you use on a daily basis.  </li>
      <li>The 2 pk made it worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what to say other than it is a good buy for someone that doesn&#x27;t have allergies</li>
      <li>I was entranced right away with the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>this is NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>up well so I have to use a very large quantity...</li>
      <li>I love the smell and its really make my skin soft.</li>
      <li>The price for this item is very reasonable and the convenience of the pump is a selling point for me.  </li>
      <li>I am a first time user of this product.</li>
      <li>I bought this product since I read that the product are natural and have a light scent.    </li>
      <li>A very good lotion, not too thick, not too thin, the scent is pleasant, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing and easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
      <li>I love this product it works and it goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I think that it definitely has a strong perfume-like smell to it.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased the four-pack of lotion in smaller containers before, but when I tried to re-order - it wasn&#x27;t available any longer.  </li>
      <li>I really like this CAnus Goat Milk lotion.</li>
      <li>Really.</li>
      <li>you might really like it.  </li>
      <li>First saw this product at the Live Expo.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This cream leave your hands very soft</li>
      <li>First time putting it on made me sneeze and have an instant headache.  </li>
      <li>I bought this hoping it was all natural and</li>
      <li>however, we were looking for something completely natural &amp; this product has parabens.  </li>
      <li>It makes them feel soft.</li>
      <li>The product has a strange smell fragrance (mix of soap and cheap perfume) and leaves the skin looking smooth until the clothes go on; after that, the dry skin resurfaces with all its ugliness.</li>
      <li>The Mass General Store used to carry this product.  </li>
      <li>Wish this was available at the same price as I got it in the past.</li>
      <li>The only natural thing is their Goat Milk.  </li>
      <li>so my skin drys out from the chlorine but using this lotion daily keeps my skin baby soft.</li>
      <li>I am not sure why I picked this up other than the fact that it was for the money a good buy ounce-wise as opposed to Gold Bond or other lotions like Eucerin.  </li>
      <li>Now, I will be placing an order for my regular Eucerin Body Lotion, which really works for dry skin.</li>
      <li>I really like over the other cream brands.</li>
      <li>I first used this product when I bought it on vacation in a little shop in Colorado.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and live in Texas.</li>

<li> so that part was disappointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really like this CAnus Goat Milk lotion. It is light, goes right into your skin, smells good and is easy to use in this large plunger bottle. What else is necessary?!</li>
    <li> This cream leave your hands very soft I really like over the other cream brands.</li>
    <li> I love this brand! It is a nice product, not heavy or greasy feeling.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Body Lotion was brought to me as a gift from a friend on vacation in Canada.  It was so wonderful that I had to find more; it is not greasy, slimy, or perfumed - it is really the most perfect body lotion I have ever used.  I was so happy when I finally found it on Amazon.com - I will be getting more.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest lotion. I have very dry skin and live in Texas. Canus Goat&#x27;s milk lotion smells very clean and refreshing. The price was very good also. MS E</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good moisturizer that could help my dry skin hydrate while not leaving a greasy feeling. After reading all the reviews the Canus Goat Milk seemed well suited for my needs. Unfortunately, after a week of use I am not happy with it at all and now I regret not buying the Eucerin body lotion. The product has a strange smell fragrance (mix of soap and cheap perfume) and leaves the skin looking smooth until the clothes go on; after that, the dry skin resurfaces with all its ugliness. It may work for some people, but for those of us who DO HAVE DRY SKIN this is NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT. Now, I will be placing an order for my regular Eucerin Body Lotion, which really works for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I discovered Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk products many years ago and it was love at first use!  I won&#x27;t use anything else on my skin.  I love their soap and the lotion and the lip balm and...okay, I love all of it!  The Orchid fragrance products are also very nice.  The price for this item is very reasonable and the convenience of the pump is a selling point for me.  I have purchased the four-pack of lotion in smaller containers before, but when I tried to re-order - it wasn&#x27;t available any longer.  I am much happier with this product (larger container/less packaging - and don&#x27;t forget that handy pump!).</li>
    <li> A very good lotion, not too thick, not too thin, the scent is pleasant, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing and easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by a friend who gave me their body butter as a gift.  I was entranced right away with the fragrance.  While the \\&quot;butter\\&quot; is too oily and rich (would be great for really dry skin) the lotion is light, soaks in right away--the kind of thing you use on a daily basis.  For me, though, the main thing is the fragrance--I love it.  This is a huge quantity of lotion for a great price.  Their are other products, too: soap, etc.</li>
    <li> Canus products are the bomb! The lotion is great for the skin, and the smell is hypnotic (in a good way). How can it be any better you ask? More for your money, and they&#x27;ve got you covered there too. Chonchi loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this product it works and it goes a long way. The only problem I have is the shipping. I ordered 1 (set of 2) and they were damaged and the lotion leaked out. I e-mailed my problem and they were great and sent me replacement bottles. I get those only to have them busted up too. I felt bad for them and didn&#x27;t complain about the second batch being broken too. I just wish they would package these better so they get to the buyer unharmed. Out of 4 bottles I got 1 useable bottle for $20. Very disappointing. This will make me think twice before buying again.</li>
    <li> My skin is really dry dr dry especially winter. I love the smell and its really make my skin soft. love it</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I also have the soap.  These products are excellent without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it was all natural and the description sounded convincing but it&#x27;s NOT.  It includes mineral oil and parabens. I hope I can send it back!  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is the only body lotion my wife likes. She once came along to a gig 200 miles away because this company was a sponsor and was giving out free samples.  Really.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite a few years; I usually purchase in the 8 oz pump dispenser size and in buying the 32 oz size, I saved a total of $10.87 from what I pay retail.  BUT one of the dispenser pumps was cracked--poor packing; but I didn&#x27;t want to hassle somebody to make it right,like having to return the entire purchase--</li>
    <li> Each time I finish washing my hands I use this lotion to keep them hydrated. It makes them feel soft. This is a great product &amp; a great value.</li>
    <li> Very hard to use -- small pump that does not work well.  Does not &#x27;suds&#x27; up well so I have to use a very large quantity...</li>
    <li> I buy Canus goat milk soap. I noticed this hand lotion and thought I would give it a try. It moisturizes your hands with very little lotion. The 2 pk made it worth the money.  I am a first time user of this product. I usually don&#x27;t bother with hand lotion, but thought I would get it for my wife.</li>
    <li> First saw this product at the Live Expo.  Tried it and loved it.  It was hard to find locally in Atlanta area.  When I saw the price, I had to jump on it.</li>
    <li> I first used this product when I bought it on vacation in a little shop in Colorado.  I loved the way it made my skin feel, plus, it&#x27;s not greasy &amp; it smells WONDERFUL.  Very clean, not \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot;.  I was SOOOO happy I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I really do love this lotion, it is a big bottle, makes my skin feel great and the smell is light and clean.</li>
    <li> this lotion is great feeling on the skin &amp; it smells fresh and clean. Comes in big pump bottle too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The Mass General Store used to carry this product.  It is a tremendous body lotion with no scent and is not greasy</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! I bought this product since I read that the product are natural and have a light scent.    I was wrong.    The ingredients are not natural and different from what they listed in their site! Contain parebens when they stated and ads it in their site that their product all naturals and paraben-free.  The only natural thing is their Goat Milk.  The rest are chemicals.  The fragance is strong also.  I will not buy anymore!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this lotion for anyone who wants there skin to be soft and supple feeling without the greasy or sticky thick feeling some lotions leave behind.  It has a nice clean soap smell too.  One of the better lotions that is on the market and priced right also!</li>
    <li> I discovered this lotion and body wash while at a friends in Oregon. It has the cleanest fragrance.  I&#x27;m a swimmer so my skin drys out from the chlorine but using this lotion daily keeps my skin baby soft.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say other than it is a good buy for someone that doesn&#x27;t have allergies what-so-ever.  I was encouraged to buy this from my mother in law, because she says it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell or anything.  I think that it definitely has a strong perfume-like smell to it.  First time putting it on made me sneeze and have an instant headache.  It does though have a nice consistency about the lotion itself.  It is not greasy, not so thick, and doesn&#x27;t lather up like some lotions that don&#x27;t want to soak in.  The reason that I give it 3 stars is because I have allergies, so if you don&#x27;t...you might really like it.  I think that I am going to have to send it to my mother in law now.  I am not sure why I picked this up other than the fact that it was for the money a good buy ounce-wise as opposed to Gold Bond or other lotions like Eucerin.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> for the price paid &amp; amount of lotion, it&#x27;s a good deal.  the lotion goes on smooth &amp; leaves no residue.  not slimey. however, we were looking for something completely natural &amp; this product has parabens.  so that part was disappointing.</li>
    <li> My whole family like it because it does not evaporate easily and scent does not clash with our perfume. They asked me to purchase more.</li>
    <li> I love this product and so does a friend of mine.  Great stuff!  Wish this was available at the same price as I got it in the past. Believe it went up or is no longer on the saving cycled plan.</li>
