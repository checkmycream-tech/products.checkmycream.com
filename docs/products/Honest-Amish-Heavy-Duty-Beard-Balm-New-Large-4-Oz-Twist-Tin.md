<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product just try it</li>
    <li> cant get enough of this</li>
    <li> I loved the 2oz jars, and as my beard is getting bigger thought I would buy the bigger one. I love the Hones Amish line of products.. very clean smelling and feeling! The next best thing to a horse and buggy!</li>
    <li> I have a very coarse, wild beard. The standard Honest Amish balm worked pretty well. This stuff is outstanding. I love the light rosemary smell. It really puts that majority of the wild hairs in place.</li>
    <li> Great stuff....there seems to be a million beard balms out there but this is the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I have a very large handlebar mustache that is well trained and doesn&#x27;t need wax, just a little bit of conditioning to Keep it out of my mouth. Honest Amish is perfect. Smells nice, all natural and doesn&#x27;t taste terrible like some other mustache treatments. Great product!</li>
    <li> See my review for the 2 oz can. I keep a 4 oz can at home and a 2 oz can in my travel kit. The tin this stuff comes in is as nice as the product itself.</li>
    <li> I will never consider another beard care product other than this Heavy Duty Beard Balm. Buying this was hands down the best thing to happen to my beard.</li>
    <li> This was my first time bearding-out and I let it go full duck dynasty! Maybe not that long, but close. This stuff really brought my office &amp;#34;game&amp;#34; together going from moonshiner to fur-trapper (pun intended) really quick! But seriously, this stuff works great, has a faint neutral but slightly masculine scent, and any excess can be rubbed into your face hands or elbows. Honestly I think it&#x27;s increased circulation in my hands too lol</li>
    <li> I like the normal Honest Amish beard balm better, this doesn&#x27;t seem to spread as easy, and clumps up more. This isn&#x27;t bad, but I would definitely go with the cheaper regular beard balm over the &#x27;heavy duty&#x27; next time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My beard actually feels coarser if I don&#x27;t use it for several days. When I use it, my beard feels as soft as ever. I have a pretty coarse beard with streaks of grey and this makes it tolerable even with daily washing. It takes some experience to figure out the perfect amount for your beard. It does work best when your beard is wet and clean. Although I enjoy the scent of the regular Beard Balm, the &amp;#34;Heavy Duty&amp;#34; version is much more subtle. I would actually prefer a &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34; heavy duty version, but I guess the upside is it doesn&#x27;t clash if you want to use cologne.</li>
    <li> I have used 4 of their products and love them all</li>
    <li> I use this as well as the regular Honest Amish Beard Balm and love it. Great for your beard and for your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the second product I have purchased for my beard.  I am very happy with this balm.  It has a nice clean scent and it makes my beard soft and manageable.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Beard balm works great</li>
    <li> this is my favorite and go to for my beard</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for a friend who&#x27;s been bearding for quite some time now but had never heard of Honest Amish. He&#x27;s now hooked for life.</li>
    <li> I bought this after using the Original Beard Balm, and it works about the same.  I was expecting it to have a little more hold, and have not noticed a difference between the Original and the Heavy Duty in that regard.  I also do not like the smell of the Heavy Duty.  This is still a good product, and I will use the rest of it, but I&#x27;m switching back to the Original.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. The model for my beard is King George V, who was King of England from 1910 to 1936 and is Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s grandfather. Check out his photos on Google. Very handsome beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HA Balm softens my short beard. Keeps it closer to my skin so the wirery hairs don&#x27;t stick as much. So it offers some control. Very pleasant smell. It also gives my beard a soft sheen. I usually have some extra on my hands after I apply it to my beard so I blend it into my scalp. Same effect. Is it better than American Crew Pomade and other of their products? Not really. Honest Amish is more expensive but I like the fact that it all natural and since it&#x27;s going right next to your face I feel I can spluge a bit. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great conditioning. I do recommend this.  Try it.</li>
    <li> A little heavier than the original beard balm. Does a good job but is a little harder to get worked in.</li>
    <li> The only beard balm Ive used for three years. Nobody else comes close.</li>
    <li> Works wonders as usual. I am a repeat buyer and will continue to be.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Smells great. My beard is softer than ever.</li>
    <li> I got one 2oz and two 4oz so far and before I run out of it I will want to order more. It tames my beard. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> The consistency is different from the regular balm. It is made of tiny particles that are extremely difficult to dissolve in your hands. As a result, one can&#x27;t distribute the balm uniformly through the beard and particles will hang on the hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried melting it several times in direct sunlight. The particles dissolve but they reappear as soon as the temperature goes back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;It must be something to do with extra/missing ingredients compared to the normal balm that makes this product aggregate in such a manner.</li>
    <li> Honest Amish - the only balm for my beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff. Shines and conditiones my beard. It has a small shaping effect but nothing like what a strong beard wax will do. This was my second time purchase.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 6 months.  I started my beard about 18 months ago.  I&#x27;ve always had a beard most of my adult life, but usually around a month or so growth.  I decided to go full beard, mainly out of laziness and just to see what I could stand to grow.  As it got longer, it started to frizz a bit.  I got some beard conditioner (Wild Man - also an excellent product) but as it got longer I needed something to help tame the wildness of it.  Then comes this product.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.  I hate wax in my facial hair, but this is just more or less heavier leave in conditioner.  Keeps my wild beard calm, without looking like it was waxed.  Smooth and soft to the touch, though a little greasy on the hands if you touch your beard a lot.  Then again, any leave in conditioner will do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have more than 4-6 months growth, buy this product.  My beard is about 7-8 inches below my chin now.  I go through the 4 oz can in about 2 months, everyday use.  I can probably get 3, maybe 4 months out of a can f I&#x27;m careful, but not with the glorious mane of face hair I have, it deserves the product, so it gets as much as it wants.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Really helps soften the hair and helps control those pesky hairs.</li>
    <li> Works great and makes beard look good.</li>
    <li> Not as nice as the original from the same brand. Feels greasier on the beard.</li>
    <li> I was VERY happy with Honest Amish&#x27;s 2oz Heavy Duty Beard Balm, so I decided to spend the extra cash on a larger container. Inherently, there was nothing wrong with this larger 4oz container; it has the same benefits, as far as I can tell, as the smaller product. However, the fragrance is actually very different from the 2oz container I originally purchased. Perhaps the company switches fragrances between batches, but the new fragrance was not what I was expecting. The new fragrance is nice. I like it but not what I expected or wanted. It smells like a citrus mint. Again, I like the product, but the fragrance is not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this balm. Controls the crazy whiskers and the scent is mild.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Use it while your beard is wet, like right after a shower. Work it in good and you can comb your beard into control. This isn&#x27;t a stiff product so your beard will still have body but its great for taming those unkept hairs that like to do their own thing. It washes out easily but I leave it in as it is a conditioner. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering or bad and it&#x27;s easy to live with. This isn&#x27;t anything like a mustache wax so don&#x27;t think your going to straighten or curl your beard or stache with it.  ****UPDATE**** I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve done to this but it isn&#x27;t smooth. The product was more like a thin wax with wax beads in it. I had to really work it up in my hands in order to get it to liquefy. This certainly isn&#x27;t the same product. I may toss it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!!! however they sent me the regular duty instead of the heavy duty, and the heavy duty is WAY better than regular.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. If you have a bushy, wild beard that needs a bit of taming, this is the stuff to get. It keeps stray hairs in place, gives a nice glossy sheen and keeps the hair soft. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I decided to let my beard grow a little longer, but as it got longer, I noticed it was more hard to manage, because I have a gray beard and Grey hairs are very hard to control. This product smell good and works very well, also people always ask what that smell is that I&#x27;m wearing.  It controls the beard after I shower very well,I I&#x27;M very satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend to others, also I love the softness that it gives my beard</li>
    <li> I loved the 1 oz tin I got so much that I ordered this to be prepared for when it runs out.</li>
    <li> Good so far. New to beard products.</li>
    <li> My beard has never looked this good.  Ive got about 6 inches of length on my beard and the beard balm keeps it moistureized and under control.  No other product has even come close to what this little can of awesome does.  It smells great and totally eliminates that annoying beard itch.  Great product all around and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for your beard and the skin under it! Also the bigger tin is WAY better!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, easy to use and without a greasy feel.  This my second batch of this product and I&#x27;m still happy with it. My only complaint now is that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize and soften my beard as much as other products.  However, it is still great for promoting beard health and fullness.</li>
    <li> My beard is 8&amp;#34; long now as I post thus. Been using the HD balm for 1 1/2 years now, and even with the harsh 25 MPH sustained wind in Northern Arizona blasting away at 8 inches of hair, this stuff still hold it together without stray hairs rending me of a homeless appearance.</li>
    <li> Id love to rate this high but unfortunately i got a single use out of it and it literally got stolen from me the next day.  Barely had it long enough to get an opinion on it. :(</li>
    <li> It does a good job in terms of hold, but the heavy duty beard balm is gritty and I cannot get the grit to go away no matter how much I rub the balm between my palms.  I much prefer the regular Honwst Amish Beard Balm to their heavy duty balm.</li>
    <li> Goes on a little greasy, but you can use the extra in other places!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I never thought much about grooming my beard with more than a brush through in the morning. The heavy duty balm softens, moiStens my skin (under my beard) no mor beard dandruff, and it tames my beard and makes it glisten all day. I do love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  After going so long (read: years) putting up with beardruff and scratching my face incessantly -- even after buying waxes and beard oils etc from other companies -- I finally have found something that *works.*  I&#x27;ve been using the balm now for 2 weeks and not a single flake.  How is that possible?!  And my beard is so soft.  I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because it&#x27;s expensive and I&#x27;m wondering if I can really afford to keep using it over the long haul; folks say to use a pea-size amount, but that really doesn&#x27;t cover my beard -- and my beard is just growing out (only about 1-1/2 to 2&amp;#34; long).  Still, great stuff.  Fantastic customer service.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really helped solve the problems I was having with my beard.  No more split end problems and really softened it.  Really like that there is no heavy fragrance. Will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> My beard is about 8 inches long and this product works great to soften it and helps keep it from looking wild and unkempt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become a daily user of this product and intend to use it as I strive for &amp;#34;yeard&amp;#34; status, I have been consistently very pleased with the product and the company.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised</li>
    <li> This is my second tin of Honest Amish.  I really like it and my wife likes the smell and feel.</li>
    <li> I ran out of this sooner than I expected because my son also has a full beard and was using it on his beard.  I had to go about a week before I got another tin of the stuff.  My beard was so dry and out of control during that time!  I didn&#x27;t realize how much difference the beard balm made until I had to go with out.  Love the stuff.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it well worth the money.  I was a chef for over 20 years so it is my nature to mix things together. In the can I add Fructis Marvelous Oil (deep nourish) and pure Jojoba oil.  Mix the 3 to a paste.  Your beard will love you for it.  This recipe also makes this balm last longer.</li>
    <li> Definitely more hold than the regular balm. Great product! The same smell and easy application as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also extra thanks goes to the Honest Amish shipment department for writing the value on the package as 5$ for my international shipment and saving me the time and extra fees I would rather have due to probable problems at customs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your product is a life-long investment that I&#x27;ll be using daily and purchasing for many years to come (Please write the value lower on the package for my next purchases again..)</li>
    <li> Smells great but very greasy.</li>
    <li> Very good product, really helps straight up my curly beard hair, a bit too oily but that works well throughout the day</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Some beard product fragrances leave you smelling like an old tool box or a peice of tree bark. Honest Amish have managed to formulate a genuine masculine scent that is appeasing to every lady that I have come in contact with.  Very subtle and not too overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;When applied to a damp beard, right out of the shower or getting it wet over a sink, it can be applied evenly. The  balm gives a ton of control to your beard and if your beard is like mine, very coarse and wild, it will tame and soften your beard. The balm is like a paste when you get it out of the container but easily transforms I to an oil as you work it between your hands.&lt;br /&gt;The HD Beard Balm lasts forever!!! The last 4 once tin I purchased nearly lasted a year (smaller beards would probably last a little longer). Just take your finger and gently scrape out a pea sized ball, or 1 1/2,  and that should adequately cover most beards.&lt;br /&gt;The balm will also leave your beard with a glossy, healthy look. Honest Amish for life!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I get lots of compliments on my beard being shiny and smells really good after using this. I have went through 7 or 8 cans of this stuff. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome Christmas gift for my daughter&#x27;s &amp;#34;mountain man&amp;#34; who loves his beard!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. Has a nice smell and really tames my beard. Oils work well but this really delivers.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husbands vey large beard and once he tried this it&#x27;s all he will ever use. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, it smells great and my beard has never been this soft! I would recommend this to anyone that wants his/her beard to be the best beard on the block!</li>
    <li> Very good smell that fades as fast as 5 minutes after applying.&lt;br /&gt;Melts in your hand easy and leaves a slight shine in the sun on your beard. Doesn&#x27;t really soften your beard much but is good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;If your beard is really unruly such as mine this beard balm isn&#x27;t going to help much at all.&lt;br /&gt; This is why I gave a 3 star rating, I was hoping for more hold capability.&lt;br /&gt;I still use it everyday though and I am still searching for something that has more hold on a beard gone wild!</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff! Only thing that manages my neck sweater! Scent is fresh but not headache inducing.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for a nice light hold. I also use their oil in combination with this and it works great on my beard. Give it a shot if your having any doubts you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Beast beard balm I&#x27;ve ever used. Keeps the beard touchably soft and the ladies love it.</li>
    <li> Great balm for beard - keeps it moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great item -fast shipment</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Does as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Im growing a beard , just for fun... But more and more Im getting to be fanatic about my beards look... So after looking at all the amazing reviews I decided to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders, a must have for all people with beard. It does have a specific smell but I grew to love it and miss it when I skip the balm for a day.&lt;br /&gt;I did have to contact seller regarding some missunderstanding with the shipment, they responded in a few hours and resolved the problem imediately.&lt;br /&gt;Loyal customer from know on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Honest Amish beard balm before and I really enjoyed it. When I reached the bottom of my tin I thought I&#x27;d give this a try just to see what makes it &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;. The balm is softer than a wax, but much firmer than the original balm; however, once in the hand it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; just as easily. This balm has a more greasy texture if you touch your beard after application, but it doesn&#x27;t look greasy to the observer (it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve put something in your beard), and works nicely into longer/bushy beards. Experiment to find the amount that works for your beard. If you can grab your beard 2 inches below your chin give this might be the balm for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couple this with the original wax when I need to go somewhere. Great hold, and touching up after a strong breeze only requires a quick shaping with the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a BIG ASS tin. This will get me through a few months.</li>
    <li> Within a week of using this beard balm, my beard dandruff was gone! I usually wear black or other dark-colored work shirts so I&#x27;ve been happy to no longer see any more embarrassing flakes. Keeps my old, gray beard neat without feeling like a wax plastered to my face. A very light, clean scent that my wife enjoys and co-workers fail to notice. The 4 oz. tin generally lasts about 5-6 weeks for me; I only use a little bit more than the recommended amount because I like to keep my beard a little on the long side. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> product works great so far after only using for a couple days. You have to try it to find out for yourself.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.&lt;br /&gt;I had the smaller 2oz jar to try out.&lt;br /&gt;There are many other similarly marketed and priced (and overpriced)&lt;br /&gt;products like this, but this is the best I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a beard you need this.</li>
    <li> The best balm out there .,, wouldn&#x27;t use anything else .</li>
    <li> A lot of product in a great size tin.  Does a good job of holding the beard in place all day.  Don&#x27;t really notice a smell to it after it&#x27;s been on a little while.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I did find however that the granular formula does not always liquify by rubbing in your palms alone. Easily rectified by heating in the palm with a blow dryer for 10 seconds. Otherwise a great natural product with no harsh chemicals</li>
    <li> Made my hair fall out</li>
    <li> Really good product…just not crazy about the scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  The smell is just okay on this, but with the amount received for the price paid, it is the best value available.  I have about a ten inch full beard and have had for years.  I stepped out of my comfort zone about a year ago and started using products on my beard.  It&#x27;s not miracle grow, folks.  But it will keep your hair healthy as it gets longer and allow it to grow longer than before.  I boughtthe small tin first to use as a comparison to other brands that I had tried, and haven&#x27;t switched brands since.</li>
    <li> After having tried many waxes and balms - my guy has finally settled on Honest Amish Heavy Duty Beard Balm, as well as Honest Amish Slick Beard Wax for styling his stache, and managing those stray beard hairs.  These products are safe, and we like being able to support this company and their philosophy and business practices.</li>
    <li> I received my much anticipated order today and hope to see some good results from my use of this product.The regular strength balm has been great and is almost gone,and has really helped in controlling my whisker&#x27;s,and keeping my beard soft.I have to believe that an extra strength version will be much better.thanks will let you know.btw delivery was prompt considering the inclement weather.</li>
    <li> Overall a good beard balm made out of natural ingredients, however I didn&#x27;t like the smell too much but the smell doesn&#x27;t hang around too long eieither</li>
