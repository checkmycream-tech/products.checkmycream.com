      <li>This stuff is really great.</li>
      <li>Smells great</li>
      <li>I think this product is great for both wrinkles and acne.&lt;br</li>
      <li>like I read about in another review and it works great.  </li>
      <li>These pads work great.  </li>
      <li>Very nice smelling product.  </li>

      <li>Amazing!  </li>
      <li>Excellent decision to put a more favorable price on the product.</li>
      <li>and I love that one side of the pad has texture so it is an excellent exfoliant too.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful results! :)</li>
      <li>, I love how my skin has a healthy glow to it now!!!</li>
      <li>The peach scent is pleasant.</li>
      <li>but they do a good job on skin that is still prone to breaking out.</li>
      <li>After doing some internet research and reading the good reviews I decided to try this product</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>Totally refreshing!</li>
      <li>These pads were an amazing find for me.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>The Gentle Complexion Correction pads are the best acne pads on the market.</li>
      <li>So to keep the effects you need to always have one container handy.</li>
      <li>I use this along with Mario Badescu hyaluronic acid eye cream to which I added my own powdered Vit C from philosophy.</li>
      <li>The citrus smell of these pads are really nice.  </li>
      <li>The smell is nice - not an overpowering chemical smell.</li>
      <li>Excellent product at a (now) very manageable price.</li>
      <li>Really nice.</li>
      <li>I loved the Peach Bellini scent, it was nice and light.</li>
      <li>Better peel and more results!</li>
      <li>I am really looking forward to seeing if it works as good as the Max Pads work for me!</li>
      <li>These pads have cleared up my acne better then any product</li>
      <li>and I found that a $5 tube of benzoyl peroxide and a lot of moisturizer is doing a much better job than these complexion pads.  </li>
      <li>love this.</li>
      <li>of my friends asked me how did my face look better then before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So many retailers don&#x27;t seem to get the message.</li>
      <li>Love this - repeat purchase</li>
      <li>I have been using an acne treatment which I love and has helped</li>
      <li>She uses it too more so for anti-aging purposes.  </li>
      <li>interesting (like peach bellinis?)</li>
      <li>I believe it&#x27;ll work better on my shoulders than on my face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m as pleased with the product as I am displeased with the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Peter Thomas Roth products.</li>
      <li>then most that you don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on.</li>
      <li>Best to use after you cleanse your face to allow proper penetration of the product.</li>
      <li>SOOO glad I did.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Love Peter Thomas Roth</li>
      <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>Now I have a beautiful clear complextion</li>
      <li>twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;The result is a gentle exfoliation that leaves my skin glowing!&lt;br /&gt;Gentle AND effective!</li>
      <li>Overall the item is great and for the price its a better product</li>
      <li>I love the peachy smell and these really clean my skin.</li>
      <li>I love that they are not stingy on the liquid the pads are soaked in as they are truely soaked in them</li>
      <li>After I contacted the seller, they were very courteous and quickly sent me a new replacement.  </li>
      <li>and they are already making a huge difference with my complexion, my acne has diminished and my face over all looks brighter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After about a week of 2x a day use (after washing my face) I saw a huge difference.</li>
      <li>It was supposed to exfoliate my skin and heal my acne and leave a light scent on my skin.  </li>
      <li>know the reason for cheap</li>
      <li>This at-home peel treatment is gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>And for a cheap price.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>A quick easy cleanser.</li>
      <li>I have been using to clean and exfoliate my skin.</li>
      <li>I selected this gentle version over the  max correction and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Will be buying again and the price is not bad either.</li>
      <li>Great product, may want to alternate between the gently complexion and the max correction.</li>
      <li>I received the product quickly.</li>
      <li>This is my very first return</li>
      <li>This is the very first time I have got a used item from amazon.</li>
      <li>Also, they do tend to sting a bit when you first start using them and if your face is not completely clean so make sure to use a good cleanser before using.   </li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite PTR product.</li>
      <li>I guess when they say \\&quot;Moms know best\\&quot;, they are right.</li>
      <li>I can feel it working right away and have seen improvement in my dkin.</li>
      <li>These didn&#x27;t really change my skin noticeably, but they are gentle and they are really easy to use vs. lathering up with cleanser from a bottle.</li>
      <li>knows since when, but who knows?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll give this a single star, and probably return to my review if the product is able to redeem itself through the course of my usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, stay away from buying these online!</li>
      <li>use this product for the skin problems related to milia (bumps, rashes, redness); good cleansing and exfoliation are vital to ridding oneself of this condition.  </li>
      <li>Having read other reviews before purchasing these, I chose these over the stronger ones and am very glad I did.  </li>
      <li>(Normally I stick to the cleanser and moisturizer my esthetician recommends, which are fine but don&#x27;t do much for acne.)</li>
      <li>the pads then move up to the max correction version with higher concentration of the chemicals.</li>
      <li>so i guess those leaking Peter Thomas Roth Gentle Complexion Correction Pads being passed around landed into my shipment!</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know whether I will reorder this product when my leaky jar is empty.  </li>
      <li>You will have a lot more of the medicated liquid left over</li>
      <li>This is my favorite personal hygiene product.</li>
      <li>My overall complexion is SO much better.</li>
      <li>I am starting to use more of these PTR products and am liking them.</li>
      <li>and they do exactly what they say.</li>
      <li>It has less alcohol so its great for sensitive  and acne-prone, skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been experiencing more breakouts recently and wanted to shake things up with a gentle acne-fighting cleanser.</li>
      <li>They are a little more gentle than I hoped for, but they work just fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cleared up all my acne, now I have fairly clear skin all the time. I cut it in half so that this gets me by for 120 uses, and also use the extra liquid on my neck/chest/back for body acne.</li>
    <li> The citrus smell of these pads are really nice.  I have added this to my beauty routine and have noticed improvement in my face, neck and chest.  I don&#x27;t have bad acne but get black heads and bumps on my chest.  Have noticed an improvement.  Will be buying again and the price is not bad either.</li>
    <li> I used this once a day for 2 months. After a few weeks, I began to dislike the sweet smell.  My skin felt sticky after wiping my face with the pads and I did not notice any substantial improvement in my skin to warrant purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing more breakouts recently and wanted to shake things up with a gentle acne-fighting cleanser. (Normally I stick to the cleanser and moisturizer my esthetician recommends, which are fine but don&#x27;t do much for acne.) These didn&#x27;t really change my skin noticeably, but they are gentle and they are really easy to use vs. lathering up with cleanser from a bottle.</li>
    <li> Really like these cleansing pads, skin in smoother &amp; I could see that it visibly shrinked the pores on my face.  I only use once a day instead of the recommended twice &amp; I like the results I see.</li>
    <li> I have no complexion problems except for post menopausal skin.  I use this after I cleanse my face and has taken care of some of the redness.</li>
    <li> I got my item today. This is the very first time I have got a used item from amazon. Not only was the item opened before, the liquid had already been drained. I have used this product before so I know how the unopened and unused jar look like. I am obviously not planning on using it for hygiene purposes. I keep on wondering how amazon regulates these things from sellers. This is my very first return and I still have to figure out how to do it. Shame on seller for selling such products.</li>
    <li> These pads were an amazing find for me. They have vastly improved my acne. My regimen used to be was face 3x a day with non soap cleanser then apply benzoly peroxide. Now i just wash my face then use a pad, and only use the b peroxide for spot treatments. Thing is, in the 2 months ive been using these pads ive only had to use the b peroxide twice!!!!       its expensive but worth it, for me atleast!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter who has sensitive dry skin, but lots of acne breakouts.  I am really looking forward to seeing if it works as good as the Max Pads work for me!</li>
    <li> I selected this gentle version over the  max correction and I absolutely love it. It has less alcohol so its great for sensitive  and acne-prone, skin. I am in the in between stage of late acne-pre wrinkles.  I think this product is great for both wrinkles and acne.&lt;br /&gt;To extend the life of the product, I only use half of a pad per application and I only use this product twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;The result is a gentle exfoliation that leaves my skin glowing!&lt;br /&gt;Gentle AND effective!</li>
    <li> i switched to these after using the regular complexion correction pads (not the gentle) because those would occasionally feel too burn-y on my face. these are great - much more soothing than the others, though i&#x27;ll also say that the effect is less dramatic as well. i&#x27;d say if you have sensitive skin, go with these, but if you can handle a little more than a tingle, go with the regular. both are great!</li>
    <li> As a 21 year old, I developed hormonal acne during the beginning of college. I have normal/fair skin. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Pro-Active, over the counter products, to antibiotics from my dermatologists, etc.  I finally got on birth control but still suffered from acne scarring.  This product was amazing!  I&#x27;m on my second jar and my skin has improved x4. I read the Amazon reviews before I bought the product and was skeptical but, these are really amazing! Not only do I not get pimples anymore but, my scarring has been reduced.  My overall complexion is SO much better. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking to help fix past acne problems.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite personal hygiene product. I&#x27;m a big fan of Peter Thomas Roth, but their Gentle Complexion Correction Pads have exceeded my expectations. It cleared up my skin overnight without leaving it dry. Thank you PTR!</li>
    <li> Smells great and I love that one side of the pad has texture so it is an excellent exfoliant too.  A quick easy cleanser.</li>
    <li> I received the product quickly. I have been using to clean and exfoliate my skin. I can feel it working right away and have seen improvement in my dkin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just not a big fan of the alcohol content of these pads--it&#x27;s terribly drying to mature skin and leaves my face feeling tight (not in the good, youthful way), red and somewhat irritated. I guess I&#x27;ll cut up the remaining pads I have and use the pieces to spot-treat any pimples that break the skin surface, as the alcohol is definitely antiseptic. However, these are just not good for my skin type to be used as part of my daily cleaning regimen.</li>
    <li> I opened the box, and it is totally a disaster, the seal in the jar is broken, and the liquid was leaking. the plastic film in the box was all covered by that yellow liquid, and has wired smell. But I called costumer service, get the whole refund in 3 minutes, but it is still disappointed. I am afraid to order it again.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper here than at Ulta. They are a little more gentle than I hoped for, but they work just fine.</li>
    <li> I am an AA 26 yo female and I have been struggling with acne since my teens having been on every antibiotic, cream, gel, face lotion, wash over the counter and Rx.  I have even been on Accutane and although it helped my acne significantly, moderate acne has resurfaced 2 years ago.  This is the only product that keeps my acne to a minimum and I found it by accident in my mother&#x27;s bathroom.  She uses it too more so for anti-aging purposes.  I guess when they say \\&quot;Moms know best\\&quot;, they are right.</li>
    <li> These pads were great! I loved the Peach Bellini scent, it was nice and light. Totally refreshing! I would definitely buy these again.  I noticed an improvement in my skin but the moment they ran out and I stopped using them I could tell a difference.  So to keep the effects you need to always have one container handy.</li>
    <li> Im a big fan of Perter Thomas Roth&#x27;s products. The Gentle Complexion Correction pads are the best acne pads on the market. I have always had acne on my face and now suffer from acne and acne scars from when i was a teenager. These pads have cleared up my acne better then any product and now they are clearing up my scars. Do think about it just order this and try it every night before bed and you will be happy!</li>
    <li> Have been using these for almost 2 years now. They really are remarkable…..gentle but they do a good job on skin that is still prone to breaking out. They do not strip or dry out the face, do not leave a tight feeling and there isno rebound effect of over oil production after using the product.  Very Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend and I have seem results in the short time that I have been using the product.</li>
    <li> The packaging of this product is, as many reviewers have stated, a mess.  While my jar was not yet leaking when it arrived, it began to do so the moment I removed the flimsy liner under the lid.  Now, I have to make sure I don&#x27;t turn the jar sideways or upside down or even tilt it too much because liquid will immediately begin to seep out!  What bothers me so much is that complaints about the packaging have appeared in Amazon reviews for enough time for the company to FIX THE PROBLEM, yet they haven&#x27;t done it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;##Note (added Jan. 17, 2014): Now Comes In A Sealed Bubble Bag available on this site and, for the moment at least, at a better price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product for the skin problems related to milia (bumps, rashes, redness); good cleansing and exfoliation are vital to ridding oneself of this condition.  These GENTLE COMPLEXION CORRECTION PADS have helped to begin the healing process.  Every day, I can see the bumps going down, the redness and rashes fading, the exfoliation smoothing out my skin. I&#x27;m as pleased with the product as I am displeased with the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I would advise those with sensitive skin to make sure they purchase the GENTLE pads and not the regular ones.  I have fairly sensitive skin and these GENTLE complexion pads are not at all irritating to my face.  I honestly don&#x27;t know whether I will reorder this product when my leaky jar is empty.  I&#x27;m very tempted to try to find another exfoliating product with some of the same ingredients.  If anyone has a suggestion, please leave a comment with your advice.</li>
    <li> This at-home peel treatment is gentle and effective. I use it daily, and I&#x27;m able to cut the pads in half to make them last longer. Plenty of solution in the container, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m in my early thirties, and have to exfoliate daily to avoid breakouts. This product keeps my skin clear and doesn&#x27;t irritate. The peach scent is pleasant. I&#x27;ve also used it on my bikini line for razor bumps.</li>
    <li> PTR......amazing products! Wonderful results! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for years, and it has really helped keep my acne at bay.  This is something that I continue to use everyday.</li>
    <li> These wipes are a god send. Use them when you think you&#x27;re about to break out and these will clear you right up. It smells .. interesting (like peach bellinis?) but I can overlook the smell for the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will suggest however to start with these finish the pads then move up to the max correction version with higher concentration of the chemicals. Better peel and more results!</li>
    <li> I would identify myself as a beauty expert. I studied chemistry and worked for companies creating cosmetics products and I have even worked as sales representative for Sephora. When it comes to products I always am very cautious about choosing whats right for my skin, since I suffer from moderate acne. This pads are incredible no doubt about it and they do exactly what they say. It gently corrects and exfoliates your skin while evening you out. I got my glow back. I use this along with Mario Badescu hyaluronic acid eye cream to which I added my own powdered Vit C from philosophy. i use these pads all over 3 times a week and the eye cream on problem areas where I think a wrinkle might appear. My skin has done a 360 transformation in a few short weeks so understand that this product is basically a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pointers&lt;br /&gt;1) After application the skin might appear to have a sheen it will go away.&lt;br /&gt;2) The smell is fantastic&lt;br /&gt;3) The pads are textured on one side which gives that added benefit of not only a chemical exfoliation but a physical one as well&lt;br /&gt;4) Best to use after you cleanse your face to allow proper penetration of the product.</li>
    <li> i really like the convenience of these pads</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the max complexion pads but my skin can be a bit sensitive so decided to try these instead. Seems to work okay so far and there is alot of liquid on the pads so that you can cut them in two and they will last much longer. Slight tingle when I have any blemishes on my skin but very gentle. I think I will try the max complexion pads next time though.</li>
    <li> These were almost completely dried out after getting only halfway through the container.  Definitely not worth the price.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have only used these pads twice and they are already making a huge difference with my complexion, my acne has diminished and my face over all looks brighter.&lt;br /&gt;There is quite a bit of excess moisture in the pad that can leave your face feeling sticky but if you squeeze the excess out and then use the pad there is less stickiness, using a light non-greasy lotion after using these will get rid of the stickiness as well. Overall the item is great and for the price its a better product then most that you don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on. Also as an upside if the pad is still damp when your done using it on your face you can wipe your hand with it and get rid of the dark spots and dryness on your hands too.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I cut them in half, and use one half in the morning and one in the evening.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have found for fighting acne!</li>
    <li> Great product, may want to alternate between the gently complexion and the max correction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received the product today with its seal already opened and the bottle seems like it has been used before. Is this product had been used before? Or do they keep the used bottle and refill the contain and you sell it out on Amazon? Either way, this is unacceptable, to be selling opened skin care product to customers. I&#x27;m very skeptical with this product, I&#x27;m not going to use it. Only if I can upload pictures on this review.</li>
    <li> Regular use of these pads prevent zits - even the persistent ones that came just before &amp;#34;that time of month&amp;#34; every month. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Never had problems with acne. I turned 40 and my skin went nuts!  Huge painful acne, aweful dark spots...I was traumatized. I&#x27;ve been using these pads along with the PTR Anti-aging cleanser for nearly two months. There&#x27;s been a huge decrease in breakouts, and the aweful dark spots are fading. My usual oily skin is no longer excessively oily, and there&#x27;s been no drying or peeling. I&#x27;m actually out today for the first time in months wearing only moisterizer and powder. I highly recommend these pads. However, there is one thing I must warn you about...you must wash your hands after using the pads. If not, your fingers will definitely peel!</li>
    <li> being an &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; die hard user of Seabreeze, which is now hard to find at my local stores, this gives me the same clean feeling, with a nice fresh scent. Love this - repeat purchase</li>
    <li> These pads work great.  Having read other reviews before purchasing these, I chose these over the stronger ones and am very glad I did.  The stronger one would dry out my skin too much.  I also cut the pads in half like I read about in another review and it works great.  Half a pad is enough for my face and neck (and I have oily skin).  Cutting them in half makes them much more affordable.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I think a pesky dark spot on my face is somewhat less dark after 3 weeks of nightly use.</li>
    <li> these have become a staple in my facewashing routine!! my skin hardly ever breaks out anymore and looks the best it has looked in a long time! Don&#x27;t stop making these! they are perfect! i have tried the stronger ones and my skin cannor handle them so i definitely need the gentle!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference after using these. I have used them daily and now cannot tolerate the peach candy smell. I will be returning to Dr. Dennis Gross Alph/Beta Pads.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. After I stopped taking birth control pills I started breaking out so I looking for something to help. I can&#x27;t use anything too strong because it just makes me break out worse. I found these and saw a bunch of mixed reviews but decided to give them a try.  SOOO glad I did. After about a week of 2x a day use (after washing my face) I saw a huge difference. Once my face cleared up I started using once a day in the mornings. Now I only have to use them a couple times a week.   Couple tips...each pad will come out with way too much of the liquid on it so fold it up and ring it out back into the jar (with clean hands of course).  You will have a lot more of the medicated liquid left over and I&#x27;ve been buying plain pads from the store and using them when the included pads run out.  Lasts me a little while longer.   Also, they do tend to sting a bit when you first start using them and if your face is not completely clean so make sure to use a good cleanser before using.   They don&#x27;t smell too bad either so don&#x27;t expect a bad medicine like smell like some of the other products.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a (now) very manageable price. $35.00 would have been too steep for me (and no doubt others). This should keep the stock folks busy and the product rolling out. Excellent decision to put a more favorable price on the product. So many retailers don&#x27;t seem to get the message.</li>
    <li> so i guess those leaking Peter Thomas Roth Gentle Complexion Correction Pads being passed around landed into my shipment! or perhaps all stocks that come with a 47% discount have leaked!! i wonder why amazon still allows these to be sold in their sites.  quite disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m just new to my area, and it was too hassle to have this returned/replaced.  the pads weren&#x27;t totally dried up so i decided to just try it out (though i dont know how much improvement i can get from using a formulation that has already leaked for god knows since when, but who knows?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll give this a single star, and probably return to my review if the product is able to redeem itself through the course of my usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, stay away from buying these online! especially those that come suspiciously cheap, as you need to know that it has not leaked yet.</li>
    <li> The first one I ordered arrived damaged with leaking liquids and pads dried out.  After I contacted the seller, they were very courteous and quickly sent me a new replacement.  I have been using it for a few days and I can see that my acne skin is slowly getting better and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Shipping too late,&lt;br /&gt;The lid is opened, there was a rotten smell&lt;br /&gt;Two of three lid was open&lt;br /&gt;I know the reason for cheap</li>
    <li> I love the peachy smell and these really clean my skin. I have sensitive skin with adult acne and these pads clean, but aren&#x27;t too harsh. Really nice. I am starting to use more of these PTR products and am liking them.</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling product.  Have noticed reduction in acne and scaring.  And for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> After doing some internet research and reading the good reviews I decided to try this product and I am glad I did. I get facial regularly and even the facialist noticed  and commented that my pores were cleaner and all my dead skin was gone and my complexion was brighter. The only thing I did different was start using these pads,especially the exfoliating side so I know it was thanks to this product. My skin feels softer and my overall skintone is much more even and less blotchy and dull. I love that they are not stingy on the liquid the pads are soaked in as they are truely soaked in them so one pad goes a long way. I use one pad on my face and then on my back as well. I highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this was no good.  It was supposed to exfoliate my skin and heal my acne and leave a light scent on my skin.  However it did nothing for my acne and left my skin scratchy and irritated.  It was also a little expensive and I found that a $5 tube of benzoyl peroxide and a lot of moisturizer is doing a much better job than these complexion pads.  I would save your money and skip this product</li>
    <li> These pads have a pleasant scent and seem to not be as harsh of an exfoliating style pad as other brands.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and had tried one of these pads at Ulta.  These were significantly less expensive for the identical product!</li>
    <li> I had issues with this product with this line of products. I was highly allergic and I waited to long to return so I am stuck with it. I simply can not use any of the Roth products.  Too bad you can not order testers.</li>
    <li> Product does dry acne, but unfortunately it also dried out the surrounding skin. My facial skin is too sensitive for this product. I tried to just spot treat, but still got the product on surround skin. I will keep this product handy for those occasional pimples that I get on my shoulders or back. I believe it&#x27;ll work better on my shoulders than on my face. The smell is nice - not an overpowering chemical smell. It&#x27;s not a bad product, it&#x27;s not a product for my sensitive skin type.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great. Went off of a review in Men&#x27;s Health and tried it. Very similar to OXY pads (far as I can tell it works the same) but these are way gentler and smell like peaches. Win/Win.</li>
    <li> I use the product every night and it keeps my skin condition really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Many of my friends asked me how did my face look better then before.&lt;br /&gt;I love this. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This clears up acne like nothing I Have ever tried.  I have tried many!!!!  Love Peter Thomas Roth products.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite PTR product. I use a complexion correction pad daily as part of my skin care regimen and it truly fulfills its claims. I read a lot of positive reviews that initially sparked my interest so I purchased it with optimism. I thought it would either A) be gentle but not effective or B) harsh but work effectively. To my surprise it is both effective and gentle enough for daily use! I highly recommend this product for anyone with problem skin or uneven skin tone or really anyone seeking &amp;#34;complexion correction&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have tried this one and then the Max corrector. This one is definitely for what it advertises. I need something a little stronger so I like the Max corrector, but this one is still a great product</li>
    <li> Nothing better than having a long hard day of work and coming home washing face and using one of these  pads. It really gets all the oil and dirt off your skin without being to harsh and drying it out while making the skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using an acne treatment which I love and has helped but while my skin was adjusting to the medication I had peeling and redness from it these pads helped so much. They helped to control the redness and the exfoliating part of the pads helped with the peeling in my skin. I only use them once a day at night and then follow up with my toner. One pad is enough to clean your entire face, I cant say that it has helped with my acne since I am using the other treatment with it but I will be buying these pads again, I love how my skin has a healthy glow to it now!!!</li>
    <li> When I got this it was partially open and quite a mess.  I have seen little to no results with this compared to the proactiv pads.</li>
    <li> I love Peter Thomas Roth products. Don&#x27;t buy this one. It will sit in your cabinet unused and you will be disappointed at the amount you spent on this product. Nothing I can do now...throw it away? :-(</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Before I found the Peter Thomas Roth pads I had horrible acne. Now I have a beautiful clear complextion</li>
    <li> I sware by this product. It&#x27;s a staple in my  beauty cabinet.  I&#x27;ll buy again and again. I suggest using only 1-2 times a week.</li>
    <li> i like it so far i have less break out i think it work i would recommend this to a friend.</li>
