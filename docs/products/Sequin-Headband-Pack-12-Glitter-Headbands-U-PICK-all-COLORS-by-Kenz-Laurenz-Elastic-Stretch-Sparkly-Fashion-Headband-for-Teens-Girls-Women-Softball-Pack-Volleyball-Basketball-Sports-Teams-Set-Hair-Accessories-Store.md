    <li> I purchased these for my daughter&#x27;s youth volleyball team and they were a total hit!  The girls loved them and they are good quality!  Kenz Laurenz is extremely easy to work with!  Just place your order with Amazon and then you&#x27;ll receive an email directly from Kenz Laurenz in order for you to make your selection.  Shipping was prompt!  I&#x27;ve now placed a second order for more sequin headbands and another order for the glitter headbands.</li>
    <li> very fast, but the color comes off of the sequins very quickly</li>
    <li> I love these headbands!</li>
    <li> Awesome get Soo many compliments</li>
    <li> I always love ordering these products and order them every year! Great price and quality! Just the color wore off faster than I would have liked, although I do wear them for 3 sports.</li>
    <li> I love how their are many different colors and how beautiful they are! They keep all their sequins and their a perfect size! They do kinda end up getting worn after a month or more depending on how well you take care of it but its not their fault its just how the elastic is! I recommend this item!!! (:</li>
    <li> Super Fast Shipment and My daughter loved them! Looked Great!</li>
    <li> Fits well. Others said they email you to get your colors but I actually had to contact them through the contact seller to get my colors. They were easy to work with and I got the colors I wanted.</li>
    <li> Your personal touch is so welcome, Thank you.  My grand daughter will love these.  It was a pleasure to choose our own colors.</li>
    <li> They were great!!! I used them for a talent show finale. They sparkled  from the stage. Very colorful and made sturdy.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s cheer squad.  She loved that they were solid enough to stay in her hair because their previous ones had to be pinned in for their games.  No more bobby pins sticking out.</li>
    <li> Very cheap!!!!! U get wat u pay for!!!!</li>
    <li> The nice look and price! My four daughters love them! They can wear them when they do different sport, or even when they go out!</li>
    <li> Every single headband came apart at the seem.  Which caused us a huge issue right at our performance.  They came in the mail super fast but were definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> Very cute but they break easily!  Bought them for the whole team and several have broken already.  Company quickly replaced the first one but haven&#x27;t reached out about the others.  You get what you pay for I guess....</li>
    <li> Great to wear during a workout or themed party!</li>
    <li> Always perfect &amp; super fast shipping :)  Excellent seller and product!</li>
    <li> Got a few packs for a roaring 20s themed party, stuck a peacock feather in them and voila!  The seller was helpful&lt;br /&gt;as I didnt specify colors when I ordered and they emailed the next day after ordering inquiring what colors did I want.&lt;br /&gt;Told them to send a variety.  They complied and partygoers who didn&#x27;t come with headbands enjoyed these.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I bought a 12 pack to make flapper style headbands for my servers at a Gatsby Theme party.&lt;br /&gt;The headbands stayed in place all night and the girls said they were very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was also super quick, I would definitely buy from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I ordered these before from another seller for the same price and they came with a reinforced piece of material where they were sewn together.  I bought them over a year ago and they are still in perfect condition.  These, however, are a completely different story.  The quality of these were extremely poor.  They were sewn together in the back and not reinforced at all, so some were already fraying the day they came in the mail.  A few have already completely fallen apart and they are only a couple months old and not worn all that often.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, can&#x27;t wait to give them out to the girls on our Fastpitch team on opening day.  They are well made and I think they&#x27;re gonna love them.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when headbands arrived.  Colors were vivid, and comfortable to wear.  Not just for teens or younger people.</li>
    <li> I love the headbands very wonderfully made and the colors are great! Just the right price too! In the stores for the same thing I would have to pay $4.50 and here you get them for $1.00 a piece. Great!!!!!</li>
    <li> These were really fun for my daughter who enjoys her bling and the color choices are great. Seller was great communicating and shipping was super fast. A little narrower than would have liked but very good quality and fantastic price.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality item.</li>
