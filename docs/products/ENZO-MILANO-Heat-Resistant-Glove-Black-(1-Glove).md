      <li>However, I haven&#x27;t gotten used to it yet and quite often find myself wrapping my hand around the iron to keep my hair touching it.  </li>
      <li>-- I love It ---</li>
      <li>I bought this glove thinking I would be able to wrap my hair around the curling iron and then grab and hold the hair on the curling iron.  </li>
      <li>but at times it is better than nothing.</li>
      <li>One glove helps for heat resistence, but I can definately see that using two gloves would resist the heat better.</li>
      <li>Would love to see how it works, but can&#x27;t give a review.  </li>
      <li>I have had Hair Boot camps and have trained our clients how to style their hair and making sure they use the tools properly and this glove has been great asset.   </li>
      <li>A walmart winter glove with a label sewed on and a huge price mark up.  </li>

      <li>Its defiantly cheap, I would not buy it again.</li>
      <li>Enjoy  Martis</li>
      <li>but she seemed happy to receive it back then.</li>
      <li>Thanks! :))</li>
      <li>Immediately your hand feels the heat through the glove and you have to take your hand off quickly.</li>
      <li>Your hand can still get burned or very hot.  </li>
      <li>I had to add two more gloves to make any difference, and this time the gloves were just normal gloves.   </li>
      <li>and I wish him well and success</li>
      <li>The glove is thinner than a completely heat resistant glove, but it is also more flexible which helps during styling.</li>
      <li>I did see someone on youtube doubling up the gloves when they touched their irons more directly like I do</li>
      <li>Always a good idea to use one of these especially when you are new at using hot tools.</li>
      <li>I just bought this glove and on the first look it looks cheap and just like so many other winter gloves that I have in my dresser.</li>
      <li>First of all, the glove in the picture is not the glove I received.</li>
      <li>my hands don&#x27;t feel hot and clammy while using them, as they would with winter gloves.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly where you need it for...to protect your hand from burning it.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>Still gets hot.  </li>
      <li>and my hand does get quite hot.  </li>
      <li>This glove is exactly like the fabric winter gloves that are sold at Walmart or Target.  </li>
      <li>Did not resist the heat from my hot curlers.</li>
      <li>My styling hand still gets way to hot when ironing my hair.</li>
      <li>They have prevented many burns that I would otherwise get due to momentary contact with super hot surfaces.  </li>
      <li>Have been using two of these gloves at the same time, one on each hand, for more than a year, whenever I use hot hair styling tools, such as the Instyler, curling irons and hot curlers.  </li>
      <li>I really just didn&#x27;t need two of them.  </li>
      <li>but it really does work.</li>
      <li>Very misleading.</li>
      <li>The glove works, but it doesn&#x27;t shield your hand from the heat as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It cost way too much to ship</li>
      <li>I really enjoy using this glove I also use it when I am flat ironing my clients hair.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if she liked it or not</li>
      <li>Having only one glove is not so useful.  </li>
      <li>normal glove would do the job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s literally the same glove as those cheap ones you can get elsewhere, except for the red design thing.</li>
      <li>I cannot use the aforementioned hot hair styling tools without this product, because without them I will burn myself.  </li>
      <li>This glove is woven, which means you can still feel the heat through and between the open woven parts, making my palms and fingers uncomfortably hot and sweaty.</li>
      <li>I also tried it for use when curling with my flat iron, I hold the hot end of the iron in addition to the handle when pulling it through, the glove is not intended for that either.  </li>
      <li>Please do not waste your money on this glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(as far as I know they don&#x27;t sell winter attire...</li>
      <li>and I was really surprised.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s back to normal.  </li>
      <li>They are thin enough to enable me to maintain the manual dexterity that is necessary to style my hair while enabling good ventilation of the hands-</li>
      <li>Yes, this glove is not 100% heat resistant...if you hold a hot iron long enough you will feel the heat.</li>
      <li>Lost other for HOT iron currler.</li>
      <li>I can still burn my hand if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
      <li>The item is to protect from the iron heat but in my opinion it should be made a&#x3D;of a stronger material because you can still get burn if not careful when used.</li>
      <li>I switched between this glove and other cloth like gloves and can&#x27;t say this overpriced single glove was worth the money.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This little glove is a MUST HAVE for working with layered hair on hot styling appliances, especially the curling wands without spring clamps!</li>

<li> /&gt;BLOW DRYING AND FLAT IRON OR CURLING IRONING!</li>
<li> This glove is a complete waste of money.  </li>
<li> I should have read the other reviews prior to purchasing this glove.</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t feel the heat for the first couple of seconds but it will become extremely hot and painful.  </li>
<li> This glove was much too thin to use with a regular curling iron.  </li>
<li> Should Hold up well if she doent loose this one.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected.  </li>
<li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, a total waste of my bucks.</li>
<li> Minimal protection, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected.  </li>
<li> You do have to still be careful</li>
<li> Not what I expected.  </li>

<li> I should have read the other reviews for this glove.</li>
<li> It was not worth the money</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t worry, you can&#x27;t burn your fingers, you feel the heat rising slow enough to stop before that.</li>
<li> Be careful!!  </li>
<li> I like the color, black, since it doesn&#x27;t show every speck of dirt.  </li>
<li> I did get the one pictured, but it offers no more protection than a thin piece of cotton fabric would.</li>
<li> it is a waste of money and</li>
<li> For $13.00 it is just a waste of money.  </li>
<li> and therefore I wasted 8 dollars and change.</li>
<li> I am not sure if I was supposed to believe this glove is heat resistant or if they sent me winter glove by mistake...</li>
<li> This heat resistant glove is like any ordinary winter glove you can buy at the dollar store.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This glove was much too thin to use with a regular curling iron.  I should have returned it, it was pretty useless.  I decided to use a regular winter glove instead.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this glove I also use it when I am flat ironing my clients hair.  In one hand I hold the iron and the other I hold the hair with glove.  I have had Hair Boot camps and have trained our clients how to style their hair and making sure they use the tools properly and this glove has been great asset.   We @mars hair studio in costa mesa Calif. Believe that the consumer needs to be trained correctly on how to use tools correctly.  We have three classes coming up and will be using this glove and teaching \\&quot;how to curl hair\\&quot; a la Victoria Secret .  This is great item to use on any hot styling tool you will see how you get the job done quicker.  P.S. Glove can be wash and it&#x27;s back to normal.  Enjoy  Martis</li>
    <li> I should have read the other reviews for this glove. I did get the one pictured, but it offers no more protection than a thin piece of cotton fabric would. My styling hand still gets way to hot when ironing my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This item is garbage. A walmart winter glove with a label sewed on and a huge price mark up.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> The gloves help me do my daughter&#x27;s hair without getting burned. Perfect for beginners to experts using a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This glove is a complete waste of money.  The cuff border is already coming apart. The fingers and writst lengths are short. Do NOT buy.  I would have wanted to know that the clipless curling iron comes with a great glove.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep heat out well.</li>
    <li> Very misleading. Not resistant to heat! You do have to still be careful but at times it is better than nothing. I switched between this glove and other cloth like gloves and can&#x27;t say this overpriced single glove was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Can we get our money back? I would like some hairspray in exchange. Thanks! :))</li>
    <li> The glove is very thin and does not work at all, you can still fell the heat and can eaily get burned. Would not reccoment this at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this glove because I always burn my fingers when I straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I used it, It did keep my hand form getting burned, but my hand still gets warm.  Its defiantly cheap, I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This glove is exactly like the fabric winter gloves that are sold at Walmart or Target.  Your hand can still get burned or very hot.  Be careful!!  Your best bet would be an ove glove.</li>
    <li> I ordered this glove on December 12, along with a Conair ceramic curling iron.  Both were guaranteed for Christmas delivery.  The curling iron came, with no problems from another shipper.  Christmas came and went, no glove.  I filed a claim with the company, they said they would send another.  Now it is January 13, still no glove.  Would love to see how it works, but can&#x27;t give a review.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Have been using two of these gloves at the same time, one on each hand, for more than a year, whenever I use hot hair styling tools, such as the Instyler, curling irons and hot curlers.  They have prevented many burns that I would otherwise get due to momentary contact with super hot surfaces.  I cannot use the aforementioned hot hair styling tools without this product, because without them I will burn myself.  They are thin enough to enable me to maintain the manual dexterity that is necessary to style my hair while enabling good ventilation of the hands-my hands don&#x27;t feel hot and clammy while using them, as they would with winter gloves.  I like the color, black, since it doesn&#x27;t show every speck of dirt.  I think these gloves should be sold as a pair-using one alone would be useless to me, since I use both hands to style my hair.  I don&#x27;t think these gloves are intended for prolonged heat contact and you should not expect to use them for that purpose.  I am thinking of buying another two to keep as extras.</li>
    <li> Yes, this glove is not 100% heat resistant...if you hold a hot iron long enough you will feel the heat. But I see that as an advantage. If I start feeling the heat through it, I know that my hair also got enough heat. The glove is thinner than a completely heat resistant glove, but it is also more flexible which helps during styling. Don&#x27;t worry, you can&#x27;t burn your fingers, you feel the heat rising slow enough to stop before that. I think the glove is great for the purpose it was made for: styling your hair with a curling iron or a straightener.</li>
    <li> Having only one glove is not so useful.  I need to switch gloves each time I want to curl with the opposite side.  This glove is woven, which means you can still feel the heat through and between the open woven parts, making my palms and fingers uncomfortably hot and sweaty.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I bought it with the tourmaline baby curler thinking it will help with the heat of the curler.  For $13.00 it is just a waste of money.  Don&#x27;t be fooled - it is not at all heat-resistant.</li>
    <li> Keeps me from burns using the Jose Eber curling iron. For safety sake i recommend wearing two gloves. Good night.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this. Lost other for HOT iron currler. Should Hold up well if she doent loose this one. Thanks</li>
    <li> I just bought this glove and on the first look it looks cheap and just like so many other winter gloves that I have in my dresser. I tried it on and the heat of the curler (I have a Conair CD117 curler) was still way too big to handle. I had to add two more gloves to make any difference, and this time the gloves were just normal gloves.   Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, a total waste of my bucks.</li>
    <li> Always a good idea to use one of these especially when you are new at using hot tools.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!!! -- Great Price -- I love It --- Thanks Amazon !!!!!☺</li>
    <li> Elephant Deals was contracted by Amazon to send me the glove.  They said that it was undeliverable but I have never had a problem with receiving anything.  I got a refund but still was charged for the shipped and handling.  When I asked them why the product was undeliverable they said that they could not tell me.</li>
    <li> First of all, the glove in the picture is not the glove I received. The glove in the picture is made by Enzo Milano, the glove this company sent is regular glove that is not heat resistant. I am not sure if I was supposed to believe this glove is heat resistant or if they sent me winter glove by mistake... (as far as I know they don&#x27;t sell winter attire...)I am in the process of returning this merchandise and I hope I can return this glove.</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations, wasn&#x27;t heat resistant a regular glove would work just the same.  Not recommended</li>
    <li> Still gets hot.  I ordered this not knowing my curling iron came with a glove, i used this anyway and it doesn&#x27;t protect as well as the one that came with my curling iron.</li>
    <li> Does exactly where you need it for...to protect your hand from burning it.&lt;br /&gt;Good product wasn&#x27;t necessary though since the Jose Eber curling iron that I ordered at Amazon had one in the box as well. So I got 2now</li>
    <li> Please do not waste your money on this glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my wife bought it with the Jose Eber Curling Iron, and it costed us $13.50 !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a normal glove would do the job.</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail and I was really surprised. I was like there is no way this is heat resistant because its so thin but it really does work. Obviously dont put your hand in a fire. But its great for my curling iron!</li>
    <li> The item is to protect from the iron heat but in my opinion it should be made a&#x3D;of a stronger material because you can still get burn if not careful when used. The item is a good investment but use with cautious.</li>
    <li> You could buy this glove for really cheap at Wal-Mart.  It&#x27;s literally the same glove as those cheap ones you can get elsewhere, except for the red design thing.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE BEST THINGS ON THE PLANET IF YOU HAVE HAIR THAT NEEDS A LOT OF&lt;br /&gt;BLOW DRYING AND FLAT IRON OR CURLING IRONING!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  wish I could return it&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected.  wish I could return it&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected.  wish I could return it</li>
    <li> One glove helps for heat resistence, but I can definately see that using two gloves would resist the heat better.</li>
    <li> I bought this glove thinking I would be able to wrap my hair around the curling iron and then grab and hold the hair on the curling iron.  You don&#x27;t feel the heat for the first couple of seconds but it will become extremely hot and painful.  Not what I thought would happen with this glove.</li>
    <li> I ordered to work with the Amika 3 Piece Curling Iron Set and it turns out the set comes with a glove.  The glove is nicely made and there were no problems with it.  I really just didn&#x27;t need two of them.  One thing I learned the hard way.  You can definitely get burned through the glove.  It helps but it won&#x27;t prevent burns.</li>
    <li> It works well when using my curling wand as directed.  However, I haven&#x27;t gotten used to it yet and quite often find myself wrapping my hand around the iron to keep my hair touching it.  The glove is not meant for that and my hand does get quite hot.  I also tried it for use when curling with my flat iron, I hold the hot end of the iron in addition to the handle when pulling it through, the glove is not intended for that either.  I did see someone on youtube doubling up the gloves when they touched their irons more directly like I do so I plan to get another and try that.</li>
    <li> I could still feel the heat through the glove. Minimal protection, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This little glove is a MUST HAVE for working with layered hair on hot styling appliances, especially the curling wands without spring clamps!</li>
    <li> This heat resistant glove is like any ordinary winter glove you can buy at the dollar store. Poor quality and definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The glove works, but it doesn&#x27;t shield your hand from the heat as much as I&#x27;d like. I can still burn my hand if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
    <li> Thought it was as described but overpriced for what you get. My daughter was happy to get it with the curling iron purchased.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed with this product. when I&#x27;m helping to straighten and/or curl my daughters hair I can feel the heat through the glove and it burns my hand.</li>
    <li> Just a winter glove don&#x27;t spend the money</li>
    <li> The glove was for my daughter. It is way to big for even my hand. There is no way either one of us could wear it and still navigate a curling iron. It cost way too much to ship and therefore I wasted 8 dollars and change. I did not want to pay again to return it. This glove is not even usable. I should have read the other reviews prior to purchasing this glove. I read one positive review that said they wore 2 gloves on one hand and it worked great and prevented burns.  It would be very uncomfortable to have to where 2 gloves at once on the same hand, not to mention, it would be difficult to navigate the curling iron wearing two gloves.I have not used and would like my  to return and get money back.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this seller and item lead time was very fast and in perfect condition&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend dealing with him and I wish him well and success</li>
    <li> made a mistake by buying this glove since there was already one in the box I bought from Jose Eber</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  Not sure if she liked it or not but she seemed happy to receive it back then.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this ...it is a waste of money and a simple mitten will work just as well for novices</li>
    <li> This was a terrible item . It has no heat resistance at all.it is a glove from the dollar store</li>
    <li> Unless you just have one hand and you want to use it for a dual chilly weather glove, its not worth it.</li>
    <li> These gloves go with Jose Eber curling iron. They are essential for not burning my fingers while using the curling tool.</li>
    <li> Could still feel the heat on my hands to an uncomfortable level.</li>
    <li> This is a joke. It&#x27;s just a cheap glove. There is nothing heat resistant about it.</li>
    <li> Did not resist the heat from my hot curlers. My fingers would still burn with the glove on. It was not worth the money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only heat proof for a short period of time. Immediately your hand feels the heat through the glove and you have to take your hand off quickly.</li>
