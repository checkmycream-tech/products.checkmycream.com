      <li>I am happy with my purchase and would definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>But even with having to do that it was well worth my money!</li>
      <li>Totally worth buying!</li>
      <li>Great quality and it Arived way sooner than I expected.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t find them much stronger than most polishes.</li>
      <li>these nail polishes are good only if u wear them for acouple days</li>
      <li>It was well packaged and came quickly.</li>
      <li>The thing about Kleancolor is their polishes are THICKER than average polishes, which makes them great for nail stamping -</li>
      <li>Thanks for awesome products and fast delivery without even paying extra for fast delivery plus no shipping</li>
      <li>but well worth it.</li>
      <li>I only liked the scent of the Orange ones -</li>

      <li>(Nail Polish Remover Pads + Cuticle Oil) with only 1 or 2 little pads you can remove all 5 fingers nails and they have different smells they smell so good!!</li>
      <li>The shipping was really fast</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>Kleancolor nail polish remover wipes are acetone free and include cuticle oil, which I suppose is probably just regular mineral oil.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t get the colors that I have spent it there was more glitter colors and not solid colors.</li>
      <li>The price was great but upon arrival, two were broken, and a few more had other problems (chopped up brushes, etc).</li>
      <li>Nail polish didn&#x27;t last but 2 days and starts to peal off colors are pretty and vibrant wish it would last longer on my nails</li>
      <li>and I am completely satitisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>The set of 48 included all normal, solid shades plus metallics, pastels, etc.</li>
      <li>They work well enough for normal (non-glitter) polishes.</li>
      <li>Some look quite similar in the bottles but on swatches, the differences are clear.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and the polishes were packed in little boxes of 6</li>

<li> With a fan on Low near me, I hardly smelled them at all.</li>
<li> I have used quite a few different colors</li>
<li> But other than that I would buy this product again and recommend it to others as well.</li>
<li> the glitter ones are a bit pastey and glitter clumps badly... but other than this.. it was well worth the buy ..</li>
<li> It was just not a pleasant package to open!</li>
<li> My disappointment was very short-lived.  </li>
<li> The description clearly states random selection.  </li>
<li> The reason why I give it 3 stars is because out of the 48, 4 of the bottles we&#x27;re all dried up.</li>
<li> They come in stacks of 30-something round pads that are a third as thin as regular baby wipes (very thin).</li>
<li> The broken bottles also made a little bit of a mess, but I got it cleaned up.</li>
<li> I emailed the seller KOLORIZE ME with details and they requested photo proof (over a measly $4 in ruined merchandise), so I had thrown out the gross, smelly broken bottles.</li>
<li> Everything was package correctly delivered at my door it even game with 3 small gifts for me.</li>
<li> There were no duplicate colors, or broken bottles.</li>
<li> Would recimend getting 100% acetone or something of the like to thin some of them out a bit.</li>
<li> I was a little bit disappointed when I didn&#x27;t receive some of the colors I was anticipating.  </li>
<li> These colors are useless .</li>
<li> get any preconceived ideas on your colors and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t buy these very bad quality</li>
<li> and then they start peeling off the worst thing about these</li>
<li> is that they form air bubbles and makes ure nails look horrible if ure looking for something that are going to make ure nails look</li>

    <li> Great quality and it Arived way sooner than I expected. The reason why I give it 3 stars is because out of the 48, 4 of the bottles we&#x27;re all dried up. But other than that I would buy this product again and recommend it to others as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the 7th of November and it shipped the same day and I just received it today November 10th. So an A+ for shipping. It came very securely packaged. The colors are amazing mostly glitter which is exactly what I wanted and no duplicate colors! It&#x27;s a great buy at a cheap price I would recommend it to anyone with a love for nail polish like myself! I love it!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend and daughter&#x27;s love this set and all the colors .</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL COLORS! I am the nail polish queen and I am completely satitisfied with this product. Love them all. If you get this set there is no need to order the separate polish from kleancolor because they are all in here.</li>
    <li> Update: these nail polishes are good only if u wear them for acouple days and then they start peeling off the worst thing about these is that they form air bubbles and makes ure nails look horrible if ure looking for something that are going to make ure nails look good and flawless theae are not the ones</li>
    <li> I loved the colors. Fast shipping too. Would recimend getting 100% acetone or something of the like to thin some of them out a bit. But even with having to do that it was well worth my money! Also loved the scented nail polish removers that came with it.</li>
    <li> The shipping was really fast but I didn&#x27;t get the colors that I have spent it there was more glitter colors and not solid colors.</li>
    <li> The price was great but upon arrival, two were broken, and a few more had other problems (chopped up brushes, etc). The broken bottles also made a little bit of a mess, but I got it cleaned up. It was just not a pleasant package to open! I emailed the seller KOLORIZE ME with details and they requested photo proof (over a measly $4 in ruined merchandise), so I had thrown out the gross, smelly broken bottles. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the color variety. Some look quite similar in the bottles but on swatches, the differences are clear. The set of 48 included all normal, solid shades plus metallics, pastels, etc. The thing about Kleancolor is their polishes are THICKER than average polishes, which makes them great for nail stamping - BUT if you&#x27;re not stamping, I recommend throwing a bottle of polish thinner into your order. Some shades are thicker than others, it varies a lot. MANY people have problems with the smell of Kleancolor polishes but I don&#x27;t find them much stronger than most polishes. With a fan on Low near me, I hardly smelled them at all. Not a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set did not include any glitters, especially the chunky holo glitters which are MUST-HAVES but I didn&#x27;t expect that from the beginning anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kleancolor nail polish remover wipes are acetone free and include cuticle oil, which I suppose is probably just regular mineral oil. They come in stacks of 30-something round pads that are a third as thin as regular baby wipes (very thin). They work well enough for normal (non-glitter) polishes. I only liked the scent of the Orange ones - I gave the others away. They look and smell very, very cheap and I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again, but I was glad to have them included in this giant set.</li>
    <li> I order this item 8/26/15 and within 5 days I&lt;br /&gt;received what I order. Everything was package correctly delivered at my door it even game with 3 small gifts for me. KLEANCOLOR wizard pads  (Nail Polish Remover Pads + Cuticle Oil) with only 1 or 2 little pads you can remove all 5 fingers nails and they have different smells they smell so good!! I was so excited!! KLEANCOLOR has awesome nail polish colors. Great products!! Totally worth buying! I will definitely be purchasing more products from them. Thanks for awesome products and fast delivery without even paying extra for fast delivery plus no shipping and I don&#x27;t even have prime amazon!!</li>
    <li> Just received my package! I ordered these along with a 12pc neon set and they are absolutely gorgeous!!!! Shipping was fast and the polishes were packed in little boxes of 6 (no polishes were broken!!!I cannot wait to try all of the awesome colors!!!! A+ all around. This is my go-to birthday gift for my lady friends!! They are gonna love these!!!</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with my purchase! Definitely would buy again!!</li>
    <li> They came each in sets of 6 and packaged great.. I have used quite a few different colors and I liked them all mostly... the glitter ones are a bit pastey and glitter clumps badly... but other than this.. it was well worth the buy .. Lots of different varieties in the colors as well</li>
    <li> Polishes are great but i was supposed to get three nail polish removers and i only received one.</li>
    <li> Order arrived almost a week ahead of schedule!  Packaging was great.  No breaks or leaks.  No duplicate polishes.  Colors are absolutely beautiful.  There were only a few that I gave away, but only because I don&#x27;t normally wear the colors.  Gave them to my daughter and she loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I kept trying to figure which colors I would receive by looking at the display picture.  I was a little bit disappointed when I didn&#x27;t receive some of the colors I was anticipating.  However, that was on me.  The description clearly states random selection.  My disappointment was very short-lived.  About half of the polishes were new colors.  I am so happy with this purchase.  I am hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get any preconceived ideas on your colors and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  You can&#x27;t beat the number of polishes for the price.  I have to order more!</li>
    <li> These colors are useless . You paint your nails and in the same day the color start  coming out don&#x27;t buy these very bad quality</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase and would definitely buy again! It was well packaged and came quickly. There were no duplicate colors, or broken bottles.</li>
    <li> Nail polish didn&#x27;t last but 2 days and starts to peal off colors are pretty and vibrant wish it would last longer on my nails</li>
    <li> Received and forwarded to the Caribbean.</li>
    <li> Love this set. I got 3 doubles but well worth it.</li>
