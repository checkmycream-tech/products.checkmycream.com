<li> The product is exactly what I wanted and was here in less time that what I expected.</li>
<li> Supposedly, it will be available in Victoria&#x27;s Secret stores around the holidays, as a &amp;#34;signature fragrance&amp;#34;, but I hope I&#x27;ll continue to find it on here the rest of the year!</li>
<li> Use product daily but this specific product seems watered down compared to the normal.&lt;br /&gt;Would have bought at the stores</li>
<li> I found it on here because I haven&#x27;t found a single perfume I like but this one.</li>
<li> and i must say i do believe this is 100% fragrance and not watered down.. however only time will tell.  </li>
<li> i bought this product a few months back</li>
<li> Appears to smell the same, might be a little watered down.</li>
<li> i have read some of the other reviews</li>
<li> I was running low on this same fragrance that I bought from Victoria&#x27;s Secret and I&#x27;m overseas now and cant find it anywhere here.</li>
<li> I had purchased this product twice from Victoria&#x27;s Secret and recently found out they no longer carry this item.  </li>
<li> The fragrance is not the same and it doesn&#x27;t even say Victoria&#x27;s Secret anywhere on the bottle!</li>
<li> wish Victoria&#x27;s Secret would stop making scents and discontinuing them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a fake product!</li>
<li> So sad to see VS discontinue it.</li>

    <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter.  It&#x27;s her favorite scent.  I never get into the city, to a Victoria&#x27;s Secret store, so when I found this on Amazon, I was pleased.  This cologne might be called &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34;, but it is also a light, soft floral-y fragrance that is NOT cloying or overwhelming nor so &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; that it makes one sneeze or turn away.  It&#x27;s not MY personal favorite, but it&#x27;s a good choice for my professional 40 year old daughter.</li>
    <li> got this for my wife and she loves it. i have read some of the other reviews and i must say i do believe this is 100% fragrance and not watered down.. however only time will tell.  end story wife and i are very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was running low on this same fragrance that I bought from Victoria&#x27;s Secret and I&#x27;m overseas now and cant find it anywhere here. I compared the scents, and yes they are the same, I don&#x27;t see any difference at all. Shipping was fast too!</li>
    <li> Everyone loves this product has such a sweet scent&#x27; everyone comments on it. Bought it for my mom . She loved it so much that I had to order 6 more.</li>
    <li> This is the only fragrance I wear!</li>
    <li> This is my ultimate favorite perfume that Victoria Secret ever made! It&#x27;s more sweet &amp; sultry yet not overpowering. A vixen&#x27; s must have!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas and she , of course, was very happy to receive it. It is her favorite.</li>
    <li> My 16yo&#x27;s girlfriend asked for this for Christmas...and good ole&#x27; amazon was the only place I could find it.  Both of them were ecstatic, and that&#x27;s I all wanted!</li>
    <li> Great scent, stays on (spray in hair).&lt;br /&gt;Just wish Victoria&#x27;s Secret would stop making scents and discontinuing them.&lt;br /&gt;This one is good</li>
    <li> Use product daily but this specific product seems watered down compared to the normal.&lt;br /&gt;Would have bought at the stores but it&#x27;s a discontinued item so that&#x27;s the only reason why I purchased the product.</li>
    <li> I have used Sexy Little Things for years and this item is not it! The fragrance is not the same and it doesn&#x27;t even say Victoria&#x27;s Secret anywhere on the bottle! It even had a price sticker on the bottom that said $20.00, so you know it&#x27;s not the real stuff. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a fake product!</li>
    <li> Good price and smells awesome! I have the mini and I was running low! Not no more lol shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Fast service and I would like to order more. Exactly item that I looking for. Me and my daughter very happy with the product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> So sad to see VS discontinue it. Thank goodness I found it on here because I haven&#x27;t found a single perfume I like but this one. I hope the seller continues with it. It came within a week. No problems!!!</li>
