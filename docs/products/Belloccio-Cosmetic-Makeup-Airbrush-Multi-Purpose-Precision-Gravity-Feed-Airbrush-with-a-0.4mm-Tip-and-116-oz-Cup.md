      <li>but i plan to do a update review :)</li>
      <li>love the ergonomic design</li>
      <li>I bought this for my Dinair compressor and it works better than the dinair gun.</li>
      <li>Better than the Luminess airbrush.  </li>
      <li>Cheaper, better ..need I say more?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased even after months of having it.</li>
      <li>It hooks right in to the compressor, fits perfectly and worked better than the original gun (very even spray).</li>
      <li>works fantastic was pleased with the quality and over all preformance.</li>
      <li>And if you&#x27;re not using the right kind of makeup in it?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely NOT a replacement for one of the popular brands of spray make-up out there right now.  </li>
      <li>Even then, it&#x27;s easy to get makeup in my hair/eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Using this makeup air brush makes it really easy to apply make up.</li>
      <li>but it gets clogged really easily</li>
      <li>The compressor part was fine, though.  </li>
      <li>This airbrush works fine for the moment.  </li>
      <li>Works perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>It WILL attach perfectly, it is like EXACTLY the same.</li>
      <li>QUICK!  </li>
      <li>So easy to use and easy clean up.</li>
      <li>The worry is that will it fit w/</li>
      <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t pray freely it sprays like its just throwing paint on my face.</li>
      <li>This would be a great replacement gun or a second gun for someone who needs two.</li>
      <li>But I read a review (or a few) saying that it worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, so good; it clogged once on me</li>
      <li>I had dropped my original stylus one day, and it stopped working.  </li>
      <li>They e-mailed me and told me to clean it.....</li>
      <li>Just keep it clean.  </li>
      <li>No matter how well I clean them</li>
      <li>I have had 3 or 4 of them break, BUT all I have had to do is contact them and they have either repaired them or better yet sent me brand new ones, VERY QUICKLY.  </li>
      <li>I did notice the difference right away between both guns and my original gun felt cheap:</li>
      <li>But, I love this stylus, so much I&#x27;m looking into the belloccio compressor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an airbrush makeup fanatic, and this airbrush gun is perfect!  </li>
      <li>Overall seemed a good product for a tem.</li>
      <li>This gun works great and works with other systems as well.</li>
      <li>in a week and quickly tried them...</li>
      <li>I have tried other airbrushes for makeup and this is by far the VERY BEST OUT THERE!!  </li>
      <li>Well, of course, I first went to the HSN website to look for a replacement stylus because that&#x27;s where I bought my original unit.  </li>
      <li>When taking it appart to clean with special brushes for unclugging it (since it clugs up fast ) it breaks easly and it bends easly when puting together.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would say Belloccio could do to improve, is  fine tune their marketing materials with better directions.</li>
      <li>this airbrush was fun</li>
      <li>They also said that they never got my return although my postal tracking proves otherwise.  </li>
      <li>This by far is my favorite.</li>
      <li>The included pamphlets don&#x27;t go over anything useful</li>
      <li>But its just not meant to work with the luminess air compressor and doesn&#x27;t spray just right.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I find this one is better the illuminair that I had previously. glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Ordered a few years ago a dinair.  When the sprayer clogged up, went to their site.  They are way too expensive, so I went to my trusty site- Amazon.  Found this replacement sprayer and am very happy with it.  The service and shipping is always the same.  QUICK!  Love, Love amazon.com.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this the description didn&#x27;t state that the more was needed for this to work.  I purchased it for a friend and by the time she received and opened it, I was beyond the return timeframe so now we are stuck with something that isn&#x27;t needed and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Can be complicated to work, and the paint barely comes out, not worth the buy</li>
    <li> Already broke. Used twice.</li>
    <li> Does not deliver an even make up application. Clogs very easy.</li>
    <li> works fantastic was pleased with the quality and over all preformance. planning on ordering another as a back up. its just as good as some if the more $ brands.</li>
    <li> This is misleading as the compressor is sold separately for another $60 and the airbrush is useless without it! Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> Works great ... I broke my first one ... Just keep it clean.  After each use alcohol fir water based and the cleaner made for silicon based if using those !! Other then that it won&#x27;t clog and be gentle ..  Don&#x27;t drop it !!!</li>
    <li> Before buying this, look up how to use an airbrush online. And keep in mind that you need to buy the compressor or it won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this device extremely hard to use. The included pamphlets don&#x27;t go over anything useful and I had to look on youtube for instructions. Even then, it&#x27;s easy to get makeup in my hair/eyebrows. This thing&#x27;s also difficult to bring through airport security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my friend recommended the beauty blender, which gave almost identical results without those problems. I&#x27;d recommend just using the beauty blender (or one of its cheaper clones) rather than this thing.</li>
    <li> these things are garbaage, they break within first couple of uses. every time I buy a new one I wind up having to take it apart and fix it the first day or two.. GARBAGE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pro makeup artist and airbrush daily on clients. This by far is my favorite. Others can clog easily etc., but I&#x27;ve had an amazing experience with this gun.</li>
    <li> I agree with the positive reviews on this product.  I purchased my unit from Belletto Airbrush Make up...and after careful daily cleaning...after 2 months, it finally stop working...I was hoping to get it fixed or get a replacement...but they don&#x27;t sell replacements:( I did contacted the company and was informed that I was out of warranty. I so I started my quest and found other similar brands on Amazon.com.  I got&#x27;em in a week and quickly tried them... I did notice the difference right away between both guns and my original gun felt cheap:( Really sad...but very happy I found a replacement on Amazon.com and for a better price! The worry is that will it fit w/my existing tube...but no worries...it fits perfect!</li>
    <li> Unable to use and not able to return. Worst amazon purchase to date. The instruction manual is too complicated. Such a small item should be easy as 123 to use</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy. Thought I could take it out of the box and use it. I couldn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> as for the luminess one, that sucks it broke down easily... so great product Belloccio!!  I would recommend this to someone who is looking for airbrush</li>
    <li> Even though I rinse the brush between each type of airbrush cosmetic it wants to clog up by the fourth cosmetic.</li>
    <li> This is the same airbrush that came with my Luminess system. It works great for applying airbrush makeup and cleans easily by running some liquid makeup remover through the cup after each use.  (I also use vinegar to remove sediment and residue every month or so.) I&#x27;m glad I found this one before I spent $99.00 on the Luminess replacement airbrush.</li>
    <li> I like that these are cheaper than others but like all the others, it only last so long. No matter how well I clean them they stop working.</li>
    <li> It could be a little better made, to make sure that when you clean it the inside parts are not to weak and cheap made.&lt;br /&gt; I had to order another one because a part broke off and couldn&#x27;t be fixed.  Don&#x27;t pull the trigger back to fast the stem is so weak and it will brake off.</li>
    <li> Very upset, it was missing the top that covers the needle, luckily I hadn&#x27;t thrown away my old broken one and was able to use the cover for it.</li>
    <li> This works well but sometimes sticks and I can&#x27;t get it to turn off.</li>
    <li> When taking it appart to clean with special brushes for unclugging it (since it clugs up fast ) it breaks easly and it bends easly when puting together.</li>
    <li> Spray trigger broke within a month of buying it. The return window is 30 days so I am 9 days past that and am not too pleased. Poor quality!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading another reviewer&#x27;s rating of the item.  Like her, I use the Luminess Airbrush makeup.  I had dropped my original stylus one day, and it stopped working.  The compressor part was fine, though.  Well, of course, I first went to the HSN website to look for a replacement stylus because that&#x27;s where I bought my original unit.  I was shocked when I saw that just the stylus alone was selling there for almost $100!  I could pretty much by a whole new unit for that price.  Ridiculous!  So, I decided to search here on Amazon.  And, that&#x27;s when I came across this Belloccio stylus.  It arrived in a hard plastic container encased in foam, and suffered no damage whatsoever in transit.  The real test, though, was will it work with my Luminess unit?  It does!  I am very pleased that this stylus not only works great, but fits my Luminess Airbrush apparatus and is less than 1/2 the price of what HSN offers.  If I end up breaking this one, I will definitely be coming back to Belloccio to buy another.</li>
    <li> This gun works great and works with other systems as well. I have a dinair compressor and my gun broke and I purchased this one and it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> love the ergonomic design</li>
    <li> The makeup looks so awesome ! Makes my skin look so beautiful ! Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else ! Airbrush rules</li>
    <li> It is very similar to my Luminess airbrush so I can use it with that system.  The needle in the airbrush seems to be shorter than the Luminess airbrush needle and I don&#x27;t really know if this affects operation in any way.  I dissembled the airbrush after several uses to clean it and had a difficult time getting it to operate properly when reassembled, still working on it but I&#x27;m hopeful.  I got this as a backup to the Luminess airbrush.</li>
    <li> this airbrush was fun but it gets clogged really easily and it can be really tricky to use if you arent careful. I would recomend you watch a few youtube videos when your still starting out</li>
    <li> I have tried other airbrushes for makeup and this is by far the VERY BEST OUT THERE!!  HOWEVER I have had 3 or 4 of them break, BUT all I have had to do is contact them and they have either repaired them or better yet sent me brand new ones, VERY QUICKLY.  I have had to learn the steps to take to avoid them breaking, the problem is that the VERY SMALL spring lever in the trigger, thats on the top of the airbrush next to the cylinder you put the makeup in, seems to just fall out while using the device. AND it is not easy without the proper small minute tools to get the spring back on correctly.But overall a EXCELLENT, AWESOME product!!! I have recommended it many times.</li>
    <li> This came on time, actually it came a day earlier than I expected,  which was awesome.  It was almost exactly what I wanted. The reason I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars is because I was under the impression that it came with the air compressor that is needed to use airbrush gun, but it did  not and therefor was unstable. This would be a great replacement gun or a second gun for someone who needs two. Returning this was simple and The refund was issued 3 hours after ups had received the package.  I may end up buying the whole starter kit that&#x27;s for sale.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. My only problem is after taking apart to clean it never stays where it sprays evenly. I have to keep messing with it.</li>
    <li> More parts apparently are required but what they are is totally unclear.  The directions are incomplete and unclear.  More words.</li>
    <li> Item came with no instructions.  Wasted foundation trying to figure how to work this item.  Was blowing air, not foundations.  Was hard to return.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to no one. I bought this thinking it was going to work wonderfully because all the good reviews. No, not even close, i received this in the mail an i could already tell it looked BROKEN, Yes Broken, the handle was loose. But, i decided i go ahead and use it maybe its all in my head. No, it doesn&#x27;t pray freely it sprays like its just throwing paint on my face. It made my face look so gross. I cant believe i bought this thinking i was going to receive something at least even working!</li>
    <li> This is EXACTLY the same gun as the one that came with my dinair machine, just the brand label is different. I bought it because my dinair needle bent and I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement. For reference, this is the equivalent of a dinair RX, not CX, airbrush gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good; it clogged once on me but my dinair makeup is getting a little old and thickening a bit so that&#x27;s probably the cause. I also bought the &amp;#34;DINAIR AIRBRUSH MAKEUP - CITRUS AIRBRUSH CLEANER 8oz&amp;#34; to use with it, the combo is working well so far.</li>
    <li> Better than the Luminess airbrush.  My Luminess broke and I ordered the Belloccio airbrush and it can be used with the Luminess air compressor.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this machine. I guess I would see some magic with my makeup I also purchased. My daughter also tried it and she is very good in applying her makeup (not impressed). I am still trying to get the product and makeup to work right. I am still on the fence about this item. If you expect to look like they do on TV, keep trying. The system is nice and works with the air like it is suppose to. I guess you can&#x27;t make Mutton into Lamb with makeup</li>
    <li> I love it a good makeup gun.</li>
    <li> Within a few months this had broke.  Not good quality</li>
    <li> I CAN NOT GIVE ANY REVIEW YET AS I HAVE NOT USED IT YET. I BOUGHT BEFORE WE WENT ON A CRUZ JUST IN CASE MY OTHER ONE WENT OUT, BUT IT DID NOT AND I AM STILL USING THE ORGGINAL ONE THAT CAME WITH MY LUMINOS AIR BRUSH SYSTEM.</li>
    <li> Works as well as dinair</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchase that didn&#x27;t work from the beginning I took it from the box</li>
    <li> I broke my airbrush that I use for makeup.  Believe me I missed it a lot because NO MAKEUP is like actual airbrush makeup.  This wand was just as advertised and fit my airbrush set perfectly !!</li>
    <li> Works as well as my Luminas Air</li>
    <li> All the bad reviews are obviously from those who have never used an airbrush before.  Especially a double action.  This airbrush is of very good quality for the money and yes, newbies, you need a variable pressure high quality air source to use one...any one.  Then you must thin your paints and even clean your airbrush!</li>
    <li> I love it. But you do have to keep it very clean to ensure it sprays correctly for the next use.</li>
    <li> Love this. Use this for airbrush makeup and love it. Best price on Amazon and works well. No defects, no issues, very well made, and has some weight to it which makes it feel sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Love Love! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful (or stupid) enough to try ordering this product a second time, thinking maybe I just got a fluke.  The sprayer doesn&#x27;t spray, when it does it just &amp;#34;spits&amp;#34;.  TCP tried to tell me it was operator error.  They also said that they never got my return although my postal tracking proves otherwise.  I&#x27;ve been using dinair airbrush equipment for over 5 years and didn&#x27;t think twice about paying $85 for their product after this experience.  I am now working through Amazon to get my refund (6 weeks and counting).</li>
    <li> I purchased this airbrush when I started have issues with my Dinair airbrush.  This one functions just as good as any more expensive airbrush out there including Dinair and the other popular airbrush make up brand with the infomercial.  I have nothing negative to say about it and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the lever on my Dinair airbrush has a comfort rubber cover on it for your finger and this one does not.  I know it&#x27;s just a small thing, but it makes a difference in how comfortable using the lever is for your fingertip.  The price on this airbrush is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I have a Luminess airbrush set up, about a month ago my stiles decided when I put my make up in it to uncontrollably keep spraying! I found that I had to replace the stiles, and choose to do so with belloccio for both price reason and the reviews on durability. It is has been days shy of 1 month, and I am back in the same boat! The stiles is spraying uncontrollably, and I have not dropped or damaged the equipment. Overall seemed a good product for a tem. fix but if you are looking for a durable product you may want to consider a different product.  I am both annoyed and disappointed the the result of it</li>
    <li> I just received this airbrush today and even though the description never mentions the size of this thing i just assumed it would be bigger :( i have never seen a airbrush in person so i also have nothing to actually compare it to. this airbrush is a Christmas gift for my husband so i wont know what its like until after Christmas but i plan to do a update review :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Dinair compressor and it works better than the dinair gun. Everyone on the reviews are complaing how their gun they bought clogged up after the forth time and I just think they are just lazy. You&#x27;re supposed to clean it after each use to ensure the best quality outcome of your gun. I&#x27;m pleased even after months of having it. Oh and it came with all the extra parts. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> When I turn it on and add the makeup..it sprays out without me plulling back on the trigger it&#x27;s supposed to only spray when u use the trigger..so when i tried to use it not knowing it was going to spray untill i pulled the trigger..i had make up all over my sink mirror..it was a mess:( would not recomend this.​</li>
    <li> Product is a waste of money unless I got a defective version. It took me 5 minutes! to finish one cheek. By the time I was done I was so disappointed that I decided to go back to mineral makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Product does not spray unless you press it down and wiggle it at the same time. Imagine doing it for 5 minutes straight! You have to constantly do that otherwise the flow stops.&lt;br /&gt;Does not spray evenly. Tried to contact seller to exchange or return the product, did not get any responses.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is I did not realize that I needed to purchase the compressor separately I would have given it five stars lost one because I had to wait to use the product.</li>
    <li> I love using an airbrush for my makeup.  It looks natural and is so fast to put on.  The airbrush that I previously had broke when I dropped it and even though this on is from a different manufacturer it works very well.</li>
    <li> I would like  a refund the comressor worked well however the wand fell apsrt during cleaning after the first use. Please advvice.  CANDACE MORGAN</li>
    <li> I bought this, thinking that it was the whole thing, with the generator and everything, it&#x27;s not. Be aware WHEN YOU BUY THIS YOU ARE ONLY BUYING AIRBRUSH PART.</li>
    <li> Misleading ad. I thought it was the whole package. Now I&#x27;m having a hard time&lt;br /&gt;purchasing the hose and compressor attachments. It&#x27;s now used as a large paperweight.&lt;br /&gt;A disappointment. I never even tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Eileen Haiduk</li>
    <li> I have went thru several airbrushes for makeup and this by far is the best...doesn&#x27;t clog like my dinair...going to order more...</li>
    <li> When I received this there was makeup already dried and caked in on the inside. Also one of the rods were bent. So It defiantly wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;New&amp;#34;. Will be returning. Hopefully the replacement will make me change my rating and view of this company.</li>
    <li> great gun for the price, easy to clean and change connectors. i bought two guns and am happy with both</li>
    <li> I was the size I needed</li>
    <li> I found out you can get good directions on U Tube on how to use and apply airbrush makeup as well as cleaning the machine &amp; the airbrush. The only thing I would say Belloccio could do to improve, is  fine tune their marketing materials with better directions. They need to assume the buyer knows nothing. It is an investment, so you want to take care of it properly so it lasts. I love the way the makeup looks. I am a senior, I don&#x27;t wear face makeup every day, because we live in the tropics, but special occasions in the evening &amp; vactions to the mainland, I love having a professional looking makeup application.</li>
    <li> This airbrush works fine for the moment.  I&#x27;ve purchased this brand before and it has a tendency to clog after a month or two of use  regardless of my daily cleaning.  It is however compatible with my airbrush makeup system and not too terribly expensive so I continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Ok, so YES I know this is not for the luminess system. But I read a review (or a few) saying that it worked perfectly. It does not work perfectly for the luminess. It WILL attach perfectly, it is like EXACTLY the same. But its just not meant to work with the luminess air compressor and doesn&#x27;t spray just right. But, I love this stylus, so much I&#x27;m looking into the belloccio compressor.</li>
    <li> Same as luminess airbrush way cheaper in price love it</li>
    <li> Works really well! I was actually pretty surprised by how well it works considering it was so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> So far it works well, but It is still new. If things change I will update in a few months.</li>
    <li> This stylus is more sturdy than other brands that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> Received item tried to use and is broken.  VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!!!!!!!!!  Especially for price!  Item taking up space in drawer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months and I use it everyday to put my foundation on. I bought this to replace my original one that broke the third time I used it (it was made by another company). I love the way my makeup looks and I get a lot of compliments on it. I would give it five stars but my only complaint would be that it is not easy to clean. Other than that, it is easy to use once you get used to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased an (overpriced) Luminess airbrush system for my makeup and promptly lost the spring mechanism in the airbrush.  The replacement Luminess would have cost me double the price of this item.  Not wanting to spend that much money, I thought I would give this airbrush a try with my existing Luminess system and it works perfectly!  In fact, I wish I would have bought this entire system because the airbrush quality is much better than my expensive Luminess system.  I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who wants to try airbrush makeup.  The look is flawless and light and the Belloccio makeup is outstanding!</li>
    <li> This is my second airbrush, I had a Dinar before. Cheaper, better ..need I say more? I would highly recommend its purchase by anyone that uses airbrush equipment for makeup...</li>
    <li> Using this makeup air brush makes it really easy to apply make up. The make up looks really natural and smooth even on my 66 year old skin, and covers up those &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; age flaws. Once you use a airbrush you will NEVER go back to the finger or sponge method!!</li>
    <li> No good, no instructions, weird set up, never got it to work never worked. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement  for my Dinair system. As I needed to send my two Dinair air brushes in for repair. Works perfectly fine. I feel that this airbrush gun is exactly the same as the ones that are being repaired/cleaned!  I&#x27;m an airbrush makeup fanatic, and this airbrush gun is perfect!  To the reviewers  that said they were clogging up? Any airbrush will clog up if not properly cleaned. And if you&#x27;re not using the right kind of makeup in it? Forget it!  This product works fine! I&#x27;m sorry that I didn&#x27;t buy here first before I purchased a second system from Dinair!</li>
    <li> didnt come with any instruction, there is no lid to that little container to protect the make up product from being spilled</li>
    <li> The whole Luminess commercials and products are hokee.  Too much trouble and messy.  Wish I could return the entire unit and products.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Love the gun. Perfect for make up application. So easy to use and easy clean up. Love this! I love air brush make up.</li>
    <li> Used it 4 times and the thing quit. They e-mailed me and told me to clean it.....like I am too stupid to try that. It will be going back. Try a different brand. When it did work, I loved it. All 4 times!</li>
    <li> never used it. The compressor broke</li>
    <li> my wife loves it its soo much better than the gun that came with her kit</li>
    <li> Should have known this wouldn&#x27;t work with my dinair makeup but seriously it works with water then the second you put makeup in it the whole thing clogs. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very long at all before it needed to be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely NOT a replacement for one of the popular brands of spray make-up out there right now.  Source elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, Amazon was fantastic with the return and refund!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. 3 different speed. I use it on the highest for bigger areas like declote or neck and on lower speed for my face. The airbrush needs to be cleaned after each use and it takes about 5 minutes total to do my face every morning.</li>
    <li> It be nice if it came with instructions</li>
    <li> This definitely works with the luminess compressor.  After months of having issues with my luminess airbrush - I ordered this airbrush gun (much cheaper than the luminess replacement one).  It hooks right in to the compressor, fits perfectly and worked better than the original gun (very even spray).</li>
    <li> WARNING!!!DONT USE THIS COMPANY...You have to use their machine with this airgun you cannot use this airgun with any other machine that may not have a settings (low, med, high).</li>
    <li> broke after 2 times using it.  It worked fine the few times I used it.  It must be because of all the parts.  If it had not broken it would have been great.</li>
    <li> Works great I bought 3 for all the girls as presents and they love them! Just love the look! best present ever</li>
    <li> Works just like the one I got in a kit and needed to replace.  Fits my machine and works with a variety of airbrush makeups.</li>
