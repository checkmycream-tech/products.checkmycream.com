      <li>Quality seems to be good and it shows no signs of wear.</li>
      <li>Love this brush!</li>
      <li>These work great for my daughters fine hair.</li>
      <li>This is a nice way to distribute shine through your hair.</li>
      <li>I am worried, tho, about cleaning the brush as the bristles seem to sit in some kind of fabric.</li>
      <li>Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, and after 5 years of use, I&#x27;m ready to buy a replacement.</li>
      <li>Excellent brush particularly for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, smooths, and makes my hair look great.</li>
      <li>Has boar hair and plastic bristles with the beads on top so they don&#x27;t scratch your head.</li>
      <li>In love with this brush.</li>
      <li>Most of these brushes don&#x27;t have the plastic ball on the top of the bristles and it hurts to use them.</li>
      <li>It is just OK...</li>
      <li>I love the quality, and that it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
      <li>Came so quickly and I liked it so well, I immediately ordered another one.  </li>
      <li>Fairly decent brush, feels great on the scalp, wish the bristles were longer but not bad</li>
      <li>The boars bristles help dispense the oil over the hair and the plastic bits help to seperate the strands for easy brushing</li>
      <li>My whole family of girls love these brushes!  </li>
      <li>The 100 strokes before bed for my hair has been neglected for years, no longer, this brush is a feel good brush and my hair is looking better as I use it routinely to deeply brush through my head.</li>
      <li>then do their work of naturally conditioning the hair with its own oils.</li>
      <li>I have bought this for my daughters, they have long hair and state that it makes their hair smooth and very easy to manage.</li>
      <li>The brush did exactly what I bought it for, mild stimulation of my scalp.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I love the new design and have ordered more.</li>
      <li>The handle is more ergonomically appropriate and feels better in my hand, although I never noticed any discomfort with the prior handle, but the new handle design does feel more solid and natural.</li>
      <li>It was not as soft as I would have liked for my 3 year old grandson...</li>
      <li>I have recommend it to my friends and they really like it too!</li>
      <li>For the better, actually.  </li>
      <li>It beats natural bristle brushes because they just tend to glide across the top of my hair; the nylon bristles of this brush part the hairs and the natural bristles</li>
      <li>They certainly aren&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
      <li>This brush was made very well, however, the boarhead bristles did not make my hair luxurious the way I thought</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just right for my fine, but SUPER thick hair.</li>
      <li>Works well for long, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Works great on my thin hair!</li>
      <li>My 9 year old loves it as much as the mason pearson- doesn&#x27;t tug or pull-</li>
      <li>and I had no hesitations reordering this exact same brush.</li>
      <li>I purchased my first brush maybe 10 years ago and have used it daily since then.</li>
      <li>I bought the brush to help distribute my hair&#x27;s natural oils, to combat the dryness.</li>
      <li>Our whole family (four of us) use this style of brush, #847, the design of which has changed from the last time I ordered them.  </li>
      <li>Oval Hair Brush Wood Bristles to upgrade my old, worn plastic brush.</li>
      <li>My daughter find it much easier on her long hair than the Conaire we were using before</li>
      <li>They are so gentle on brushing out tangles and brushing hair when wet.</li>
      <li>I have long straight hair that gets very dry in the desert climate I live in.</li>

<li> However, there are a lot of them and they are certainly long enough to reach my scalp.</li>
<li> I highly recommend it, especially for those of us with thick hair.</li>
<li> Oh, I suppose they might work with long hair that isn&#x27;t close to the scalp, but that&#x27;s where all the oils are you want to brush into the rest!&lt;br</li>

<li> Minimal breakage.</li>
<li> The bristles are spaced a little further apart from each other, which somehow makes it feel even nicer on my head and running through my hair.  </li>
<li> After a few uses, the natural bristles absorb some of your hair&#x27;s oil and you get NO static after brushing.</li>
<li> Since using the brush, my hair seems to be less dry at the tips and less oily at the scalp.</li>
<li> may try to cut the nylon down, see if I can stand the sharp unprotected nylon ends.</li>
<li> Coodos Bass.</li>
<li> Bought this along with the Bass Brushes Lg.</li>
<li> The nylon bristles work like any others, getting down to the scalp and untangling hair.</li>
<li> The little rubber tips on the brush heads started to fall off after all of these years</li>
<li> and I felt like I wasted money.</li>
<li> I have been using it for years and purchased a few of them to keep it in the office, purse and home.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find this type of brush.</li>

    <li> In love with this brush. It&#x27;s just right for my fine, but SUPER thick hair. Ah...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!!  It doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out.  It&#x27;s gentle, smooths, and makes my hair look great.</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the Bass Brushes Lg. Oval Hair Brush Wood Bristles to upgrade my old, worn plastic brush. This is a nice way to distribute shine through your hair. Minimal breakage. I am worried, tho, about cleaning the brush as the bristles seem to sit in some kind of fabric.</li>
    <li> Bought for my beard, wish description was a lot clearer, but thank God for a wife.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful brush. I gave it as a gift to a young woman with very long, thick hair the composition of the brush worked wonders combining detangling with shine.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush particularly for fine hair.  Would purchase again and will.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well with soap and water.  Do try it.&lt;br /&gt;ss</li>
    <li> My whole family of girls love these brushes!  They are so gentle on brushing out tangles and brushing hair when wet.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairbrush ever. It beats natural bristle brushes because they just tend to glide across the top of my hair; the nylon bristles of this brush part the hairs and the natural bristles then do their work of naturally conditioning the hair with its own oils. This brush should sell everywhere.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I hoped the nylon bristles would stiffen the brush so it would go through my hair easier without the boar hairs bending and not reaching my scalp. The nylon bristles work like any others, getting down to the scalp and untangling hair. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re so much longer than the boar bristles that the boar ones barely touch my hair. They certainly aren&#x27;t doing anything. Oh, I suppose they might work with long hair that isn&#x27;t close to the scalp, but that&#x27;s where all the oils are you want to brush into the rest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try to cut the nylon down, see if I can stand the sharp unprotected nylon ends. I&#x27;ve searched Amazon, but as far as I can tell, all of the other combination brushes have the same problem with the nylon bristles being way longer. Why? I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> I have buying brushes from this company for quite some time.  I love the quality, and that it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> It is just OK...It was not as soft as I would have liked for my 3 year old grandson...he will grow into it...</li>
    <li> These work great for my daughters fine hair. This comes in a purse size as well. We no longer have every morning complaints!</li>
    <li> This brush was made very well, however, the boarhead bristles did not make my hair luxurious the way I thought and I felt like I wasted money.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for these type of brushes. Im a happy canper now</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, and after 5 years of use, I&#x27;m ready to buy a replacement. Thank goodness they still sell this brush!</li>
    <li> The brush did exactly what I bought it for, mild stimulation of my scalp.  I try to brush my hair and scalp 100 strokes 2 times a day.  This brush does the job without breaking the bank.  The brush arrived on time no problems.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first brush maybe 10 years ago and have used it daily since then. The little rubber tips on the brush heads started to fall off after all of these years and I had no hesitations reordering this exact same brush. I highly recommend it, especially for those of us with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Fairly decent brush, feels great on the scalp, wish the bristles were longer but not bad</li>
    <li> Great brush. My daughter find it much easier on her long hair than the Conaire we were using before</li>
    <li> My sister had given me one of these ages ago and it&#x27;s the best hair brush I&#x27;d found. I had looked in the stores and finally found them on Amazon. It gives my scalp a wonderful massage and works great for my hair.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Feel like heaven on your head. Works well for long, fine hair. After a few uses, the natural bristles absorb some of your hair&#x27;s oil and you get NO static after brushing.</li>
    <li> Came so quickly and I liked it so well, I immediately ordered another one.  Marcia English</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair that gets very dry in the desert climate I live in. I bought the brush to help distribute my hair&#x27;s natural oils, to combat the dryness. The boar bristles are short compared to the plastic bristles.However, there are a lot of them and they are certainly long enough to reach my scalp. The handle is solid wood and the bristles are set into a rubber inset. The brush looks way more expensive than it is. Since using the brush, my hair seems to be less dry at the tips and less oily at the scalp. I am a big fan.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush.. what can I say? I&#x27;m a guy with shorter hair and have been using it for some time now. Quality seems to be good and it shows no signs of wear.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever. I have bought this for my daughters, they have long hair and state that it makes their hair smooth and very easy to manage. I have recommend it to my friends and they really like it too!</li>

The bristles are spaced a little further apart from each other, which somehow makes it feel even nicer on my head and running through my hair.  However, time will tell if the plastic bristles that surround the boar hair will keep their soft-tips intact, a problem we had when my five-year-old daughter got hold of one of the brushes one afternoon and pulled them all off, rendering the brush unusable due to the sharpness of the plastic bristles without the soft \\&quot;cap.\\&quot;  Overall, I love the new design and have ordered more.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I have been using it for years and purchased a few of them to keep it in the office, purse and home. Works great on my thin hair!</li>
