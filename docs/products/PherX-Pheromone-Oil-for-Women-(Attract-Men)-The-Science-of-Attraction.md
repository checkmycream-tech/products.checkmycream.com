<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved this product subtle smells great not too strong lasts all day, but because i found it and used the rest of it, every single person who would pass me would comment on how nice i smelled and don&#x27;t even care that it&#x27;s a pheromone perfume totally worth every penny.i was so happy i found it too! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I like the smell...haven&#x27;t noticed any men following me around like &amp;#34;The Pied-Piper&amp;#34; though</li>
    <li> Works! My boyfriends cheeks turned flush the first time I used and he wouldn&#x27;t stop talking and it made me giggle</li>
    <li> Came quickly, great customer care n service but I did not like this scent.. Smelled like a woman or woman who rarely bathes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of this attraction-perfumes, and ive Found this to be my absolute favorite Brand. IT smells great and i get a lot of compliments from by bf and others when i use it. IT actually works!!!!</li>
    <li> Although I may have not given it enough time, {just received it yesterday} to see how it works {around men}, my family has commented about the pleasant smell. Waiting to see how it works on the opposite sex! Was very happy with the time it took to receive my order. As always, Amazon is #1 with me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it a ? Right now. Because I just received it today but I&#x27;m satisfied with Amazon/ fast delivery. But I&#x27;m gonna test this out &amp; I really will update in a week of use. Thanks look for my update review.</li>
    <li> wanted to try this to see if it works.  i am not sure yet because i have only tried this for a few days.  it smells alright...kind of a musky smell.  i think a floral smell would have been better.</li>
    <li> it is a means which is necessary to create the image of a sexy women that will be confident that he can seduce a man.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I was curious as to whether or not it would work.  I am a 51 year old woman who has gone through menopause, and I don&#x27;t get as much attention as I use to.  I&#x27;m not beautiful, but I don&#x27;t look bad, but...still, something was off, and I wondered if it was a lack of pheromones due to having gone through menopause.  So...I ordered.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for four days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it to work and out shopping, and no...men are not chasing me down.  But...that being said, there are some things about this product that I know I will order it again.  First...the way it makes ME feel.  I do not believe it&#x27;s a placebo effect, because if it was, I&#x27;d have been discouraged that men weren&#x27;t chasing me down and I&#x27;d have stopped wearing it. But, somehow, it does affect ME.  It makes me feel more confident and alive.  Makes me feel happier a few minutes after I put it on.  Makes me feel how I felt when I was younger.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m sexier with it, but I darn well FEEL sexier...lol  And, it&#x27;s a good feeling.  Placebo effect or not, I like the feeling, I will reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so affects on other people.  I work at a special needs school, and suddenly two students with Autism started interacting with me, shocking everyone who was watching, because they NEVER interact with anyone.  And, they interacted with me for 30 minutes until I had to leave.  As a matter of fact, all the students have been really much warmer with me than before, in a way that is noticable to me.  Ok, big deal, right...Well, just thought I&#x27;d mention it because I have been finding that rather strange.  Strange enough to believe it was the Pherx that caused it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out shopping, men don&#x27;t chase me down....but I have looked back to see them turning around to look back at me, several times, even though they didn&#x27;t pay attention to me when I was right by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the one big thing is.......I&#x27;ve been seeing this man for a long time now.  He is not my boyfriend, he is my friend with benefits.  I don&#x27;t know how I got myself into that situation with him, but I did.  I always wanted more, but he didn&#x27;t, and this is just the way it&#x27;s wound up.  But, today....he came over and was suppose to stay 2 hours, and he wound up spending most of the day.  And, he was acting like a man in love, couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off me, didn&#x27;t want to leave, was just so LOVING and started sharing things with me that he&#x27;s never shared before.  His behavior was soooo out of the norm!  But the thing that got me is....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, my son had wrecked his car into a post on my carport a couple of months ago.  I need to figure out how to fix or replace that post.  So...my guy, who has seen that post many times and never said anything....out of the blue starts telling me &amp;#34;well, we could take it off, and do this or that or this to it.  Or, we could do this...or we could do that....&amp;#34;  I never even talked to him about fixing it!  it has never occurred to me to ask him to do anything like that for me because....it&#x27;s just not that kind of relationship.  So, it kind of shocked me that he&#x27;d bring it up himself and start volunteering and using the word WE.  I didn&#x27;t even bring up the post!  I didn&#x27;t say a word about it, he started that conversation...and I was thinking, he just WANTS to do something for me, and that was all he could think of.  And even though he was saying WE, it was like he wanted to say WE, to put us together as a WE...but he really meant he&#x27;d be fixing it for me.  And, when he left....I didn&#x27;t hear his truck driving away, and I looked out my side window, and he was out there measuring that post! And, then he got in his truck and left.  I was tickled.....And, I was thinking......what the hell has got into him?????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it was the pherx.  I know it&#x27;s a silly story, but seriously....I don&#x27;t know what else could have came over him after all this time.  So...I&#x27;m gonna keep wearing it, that&#x27;s all I got to say about that.lollol</li>
    <li> Drives my husband crazy... so it works wonderfully for me. My only negative is that I dislike the lightly scented perfume smell. However, it is extremely light (not heavily scented), so I am easily able to cover it up with a few sprays of my own perfume. I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days, so I will update on its effects again in the future.</li>
    <li> Bought for friend and she said no difference, it was a joke for her anyway, we all had a good laugh.</li>
    <li> Got my ex back by using this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted it to work!!! And still, not even a placebo effect... not my husband or any other man reacted or treated me differently while wearing this oil by the instructions given. Would love my money back. I do not recommend this, do not buy.</li>
    <li> I will order this again very nice smell.</li>
    <li> I like it but.....It could just be my body chemistry but the spray had an unpleasent odor to my nose.  Everyone else liked it.  The oil works for me just fine.  I&#x27;m not, not recommending the spray for anyone else, but, I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast. I opened the bottle and took a whiff... it has a slightly musk like aroma, not exactly my signature scent but not at all unpleasant. Just different. I was making a brief trip to the town grocery store so I thought I would check it out. Put it first on my wrists then dabbed it on my neck and behind my ears from there. A little goes a long way. I was walking into the store and the teenage boy who was behind me (and apparently downwind) rushed ahead of me to pull a cart out for me. (his mother looked slightly perplexed). There were 2 men in the store that were trying unusually hard to start conversation with me and the boy that was bagging my groceries was flirting and turned all shades of red.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that while I do NOT think that I am all that, I do know that I am a reasonably attractive person to begin with... I have never had problems finding a date and have very rarely been rejected. HOWEVER I will say with certainty that this drastically changed the initial response of the men around me. Impressed to say the least :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for the last 3 days and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a placebo effect but I am noticing people chatting me up more than usual. Not necessarily flirty or anything, just more chatty. I don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s nice. My boyfriend does seem to be more nuzzly with me. It&#x27;s sweet. I do like the scent. It&#x27;s is mild and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> love the product. smells fantastic, i&#x27;m not sure if it necessarily attracts my husband any more than usual but I love that I feel more feminine wearing it.  :)</li>
    <li> This product absolutely did not work at all,in fact everyone I went around asked \\&quot;what is that smell\\&quot; and not in a good way. I tried it 3 times and got a migraine each time,my husband said it makes him sick to his stomach!</li>
    <li> My god! It woorrkkkk!!!! Luv it! They wanna eat you.</li>
    <li> PhereX Pheromone oil for women is a soft aroma that I really like it, I&#x27;d purchased it twice already and I&#x27;m pretending to keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all for me. There was no difference in my husband&#x27;s or any other men&#x27;s behavior. I recently had a hysterectomy and hoped this would help my husband feel more sexual toward me. It smells pleasant, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I spent what I consider a fortune for this product and its delivery and I just want to slap myself in the face! I&#x27;d never tried pheromones before, but I wanted to give it a go because I read some fantastic reviews. I consider myself good-looking enough to get men without the aid of a pheromone oil, but since the guy I had just started dating was always a bit too cold when we were in public situations, I thought to spice things up a bit and get him to show more interest in me. I admit that I also extremely enjoy guys attention and if it could earn me a bit extra tips in work all the better. It didn&#x27;t work at all. Actually, the times I didn&#x27;t put it on I received more compliments and phone numbers than the times I used it. I slowly increased the dose, first only putting it on my neck and wrist and then adding some to my chest and behind my ears. Nothing happened. I went as far as having male friends and colleagues sniffing it directly from my skin: they said it was pleasant, but they preferred the perfume I used before; some of them even started suggesting other fragrances I might buy instead. For what concerns the guy I was dating, my exasperation led me to raise the issue face to face and he told me that he acted that way only because he didn&#x27;t want to be that kind of couple who&#x27;s doing love birds in front of people making them uncomfortable, but he added that I was the only girl who could make him happy. Then he asked me to become his girlfriend officially and we&#x27;ve being together since. If I had known that before I would have saved a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you feel like you want to throw away your money I strongly suggest to buy this product, otherwise just put on a sexy dress, fix your makeup and act with more confidence - you&#x27;ll get all the men you want.</li>
    <li> this stuff really does work. I definitely prefer the oil because it seems to stay on a little longer, but even from the very first time I used it I was like a magnet. I say give it a try, if it doesnt work, return it. But I&#x27;ll be keeping mine.</li>
    <li> Love the subtle powder scent not over bearing. When my husband comes home from work he seems to be more calm and more willing to talk with a smile on his face.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well!</li>
    <li> bought it for a birth day gift for a friend and she loves it.  it smells good and it really works. She is getting more notice then usual when she wares it. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking to smell good and be noticed.</li>
    <li> I have the oil and the spray.  The oil doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, but the spray does and it is very soft and smells good.  I wore the oil and a little spray when I was teaching a class full of men.  They seemed very receptive to me.  I will probably buy more.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time I had order this product, in lest than a year. True review from my heart, and I am very positive about rating. Love it, will continue buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I feel this stuff really works!!!</li>
    <li> This product change my life is amazing, you have to try it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you PherX</li>
    <li> Received the product, and even though it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on the opposite sex, whether it be at work or in a casual atmosphere, the scent is pleasant and smells almost baby powdery.  The scent also mixes well with my regular perfume so it&#x27;s fine to wear underneath your regular perfume.</li>
    <li> This product does work good, may have to apply more than a small amount although. I would recommand using the spray as well as the oil.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty nice, make sure not to overdo it if you don&#x27;t want a headache though. It seems to have a pretty good effect on others as well, it effected my boyfriend pretty interestingly the first time I wore it. He said when he first got a wif of it, he felt a rush of energy and his heart started to beat pretty fast. he suddenly felt really giddy(and a tad aroused). This lasted a few minutes. So it doesn&#x27;t seem to really draw men to you persay, but deffinitally makes them notice you a bit more haha. Plus I like the scent and it gives a sort of confidence when worn.</li>
    <li> So far it has been pretty good. I notice that when I wear it I get a lot of positive attention.  The package arrived timely and we&#x27;ll sealed. Very happy!</li>
    <li> For me this product did not work.  It did smell quite nice although I thought a bit too strong for my taste, but I did not notice any difference whatsoever, not with my husband, or co-workers or even girlfriends that supposedly would become even nicer.  I read a lot of the reviews before risking it, but in the end my own charm and personality can do better than this product accomplishing exactly what it claims to do.  I do not think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice during the past week and I definitely noticed a difference in the intensity of my husbands&#x27; attraction towards me.</li>
    <li> I do not know if this attracted more men or not, and it smells a little like urine.  I actually bought Basic Instinct which smells amazing and mixed this in with it.  I could not wear it straight because of the urine smell.  But since I like the other so much, It definitely helped to stretch it out.</li>
    <li> So, I received my bottle yesterday and let me tell you IT REALLY WORKS! I am currently in school and am in an educational setting where it very male dominated. That being said, it&#x27;s not uncommon to have some conversations here and there. However, today we had a large networking reception, and men were seeking me out and coming up to me and hanging around me all evening! I mean I would leave for a minute and guys were waiting for me. One guy kept saying he had to go but continued talking for an additional 45min. Another guy, although always professional, really made it a point to hang out by me all evening. So suffice it to say, this totally works. This was not just placebo effect or natural charm (which I do believe I have) but this stuff really pronounces it and brings it out. Also, the smell is quite pleasant. It is a little musky but lovely. I probably won&#x27;t wear this everyday as I think the results are rather intense. I have  date next week though so you can bet your bottom dollar I&#x27;ll be wearing it then :)</li>
    <li> So I purchased this for my wife. She serves at a restaurant. We hoped it would help with tips, as she works at a brew pub. I opened the bottle and it reminded me of my favorite smell on a woman. It&#x27;s hard to say this oil makes her more attractive or will bring her better tips. But I do very much enjoy her wearing it and I live the smell. I do find myself wanting to take her when she is wearing it.</li>
    <li> i like it fine, It just hasn&#x27;t worked.</li>
    <li> i am an experieced phero user &amp; was very curious about this bc of its makeup...it has all the major pheros&amp; then some. it has a nice silky consistency but comes out a bit too fast. smells better than most...kinda like shsving cream! my fiance usually immediately \\&quot;reacts\\&quot; when i cuddle him with copulins on, &amp; i feel self effects as well...but unfortunately not with this product. and no reaction from any outside men either. the company is very nice&amp; shipped on time, but no luck otherwise.</li>
    <li> I had recently purchased the pheromone spray and then also acquired the oil. If I were to compare the two, I would recommend the spray over the oil. Personally both have a similar scent and the oil is very easy to bring with you in your purse, but I don&#x27;t feel like I get the same reaction from it. I feel like people are nicer to me when I am using the spray. Maybe I would mix this oil in with a little water and make my own spray? It is a good product, but does not appear to work super super well, especially when I compare it to the spray.</li>
    <li> I would love to say it worked, unfortunately it has not. I received 5 days ago and started using immediately. I did as many suggested, I shook it well and rubbed a few drops on pulse points. It smells faintly like men&#x27;s cologne on me. I will change my review should I notice anything different but for now I see nothing to justify the cost. However, it did arrive promptly.</li>
    <li> I work in a male dominated office and I have noticed that when I wear the Pheromone Oil, I tend to get more of a positive response out of my males colleagues.  They tend to gather around my office and are more responsive to almost anything.  I have secretly included the other ladies in our office in on my secret and offered for them to try the Pheromone Oil to see if they notice a difference!  They all came back and reported they couldn&#x27;t believe the great results!  One of the ladies has a hard time with one of the bullies in our office and she reported back that he turned into a &amp;#34;pussy cat&amp;#34;.  You can’t go wrong trying it.</li>
    <li> I was worried because I heard phermones smell musty but this smells good:). It also has a good price :)</li>
    <li> I like this product. It has a powdery smell, its pleasant. I do feel like I have been getting more attention from my husband, he&#x27;s been more touchy feely since I started wearing it! I wish the bottle was bigger!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. I also have the perfume for women. The smell is a little strange but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I do feel like it works but I don;t like that I have to apply multiple times a day. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> I just go it and I love it! I have had good results, but I don&#x27;t know if it is from using this product or its just luck! however I love the smell and I will continue using it!</li>
    <li> Tried this a few times on my partner and he seemed to act cuddly and lovey only the first time. He is not aware of me using the product. Also tried this when I went to the store and no reactions. Same case in a party as well. Maybe I still have to experiment with a little. Also when I use it I get a very slight headache which doesnt last very long though. I use the product on my pulse points. I will update my review if I notice any changes in my experience.</li>
    <li> Good product. Smells really nice and attractive! It is really different from the normal perfume in the stores. The cap of the bottle is hard to be opened! Need to open it with great effort!</li>
    <li> Received  3 weeks ago. Tried it few different occasion. I wear it to work, to date and attend an event. However, dont see any difference after using this. Nice people are still nice. Those tough people didn&#x27;t became nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is too strong and smell like some cheap perfume or cleaning detergent. Honestly ,in the beginning  it is a little embarrassing to wear it as the fragrance is totally not classy but could not be covered by my own regular light perfume. Now I use my body lotion which has stonger but nicer fragrance to cover it. I will keep trying though.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I heard it&#x27;s an attraction all since I got it haven&#x27;t attract anyone yet, but everything works in its own time, I will keep using it till it&#x27;s finished.</li>
    <li> Bought for a guy friend as a joke. Stunk like baby powder and sweaty gym socks. Gave everyone a good laugh.</li>
    <li> The product smells weird at first but give it a couple of minutes, then it blends to your skin and would smell fantastic alone and even under your favorite perfume. I dont think that it wildly attracts a mate or men (like other reviews on it) but i noticed that those men felt good around me. I dont know if it&#x27;s just me, but i feel confident on myself when i wear this. maybe psychological that i tend to smile a lot knowing that im wearing pheromones that attract men. It last about a couple of hours. I put it at 6am and i cant smell it at 12pm. 6hours is quite good knowing that i live in a tropical country. I put more than what is said. If you dab only a few the scent would last you about 3hours just as my first time putting this on. So i realized i had to put more and leave it absorbed by my skin. I used this product 5 consecutive days before i put on a review. Again i say that this does not sexually or physically attract men as per my experience. But it is a good buy as a perfume oil and as a confidence booster.</li>
    <li> I have worn this once or twice. I may see a little be of a difference but most of the time I haven&#x27;t seen noticeable results. Honestly though I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had ample enough opportunity to try it out.  Generally my boyfriend seems to act about the same but my boss seems to be nicer to me... so maybe it is working. Anyway, I plan on testing this out more and I hope to have more results to post soon.  As far as the smell, it was a little strong at first to me but I got used to it.  I could still smell it through my perfume but other people I was around could only smell my perfume. It&#x27;s powdery &amp; musky smelling but light enough to layer with other scents.</li>
    <li> I seem to have a positive response from men when I wear this product, so I&#x27;ll keep it up :)</li>
    <li> So disappointed, nothing more to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have no use at all .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on these product, seriously.</li>
    <li> This does smell good, kind of sweet. I am excited to use it with my husband to see if it has a positive effect on him</li>
    <li> Didnt make any difference. I got it just to try out several with friends and none of us noticed anything.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> Okay, I used this product for about a week. Used it when i was with my boyfriend and also at work. Honestly I didn&#x27;t feel any difference. The smell is not bad at all though, I don&#x27;t know what some people are talking about when they say they hate the smell. It is a very subtle shampoo-flowery kind of smell. You won&#x27;t even feel it that much.</li>
    <li> Product is excent. It works!!!</li>
    <li> This works well but there are some limitations. For one thing, it doesn&#x27;t work on everyone, but that&#x27;s just common sense. Not everyone&#x27;s natural pheromones are matched perfectly to begin with, so I didn&#x27;t expect that. And it doesn&#x27;t work on people that just pass within 5 feet of you and are headed in e opposite direction. It seems to only work on people that you&#x27;re in extended close contact with and already know, like coworkers. I&#x27;ve noticed that people I know and are on either okay or less than okay terms with are more polite and friendly to me with it; they want to hang around longer and talk. it definitely makes interactions with unfriendly people easier and more harmonious, and I&#x27;m not imagining that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for sexual attraction, I&#x27;m not so sure if it works. Maybe it helps if someone is already into you to begin with, but it isn&#x27;t going to work magic if there&#x27;s no initial attraction between 2 people. I still give it high ratings just for making my platonic and professional interactions a lot more pleasant.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, just a dab on the pulse points (behind ears, neck, and wrist) and magic happens. Ordinary errands like going to the bank seem to be more interesting. People are nice, smile a bunch, and engage in conversation( both male and female, but I notice more male encounters). The product has a great subtle scent which doesn&#x27;t interfere with body lotions or soaps. I&#x27;m enjoying it!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it. Ive been getting alot of attention from him since I started using it. You should definitely try it.</li>
    <li> Use it thrice, and all I can say is IT WORKED!..</li>
    <li> I agree that the subtle smell is plesant, but you can&#x27;t really smell it unless someone is sniffing it very close to your skin. I would&#x27;ve given this a star or two more if I could use it as a perfume, but it&#x27;s not even good for that purpose. And it also DID NOT work to attract or entice men the way some of the other reviews have outlined. So not being a good perfume and not working to entice men, in the end what you are left with is a very expensive oil. I tried it on my BF who couldn&#x27;t even smell it untill he put his nose on my skin and it didn&#x27;t make him any different than normal. Then I tried it on random men, as I was running errands, and no one did or say anything out of the ordinary to me.  For me, it was a wate of money.</li>
    <li> Smells really good....It gives me the confidence and makes me feel real good.  I am already attractive and good looking but I think this product even attracts more men and women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little skeptical of how well pheromone perfumes work, and still really am not sure. I haven&#x27;t noticed any particularly different response from men when wearing this. However, I LOVE the smell! Even if it wasn&#x27;t a pheromone oil, I would buy this perfume just for the scent. It&#x27;s like baby powder, only not sickeningly sweet and slightly different. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but very unique. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. But that&#x27;s ok--I just carry the bottle in my purse and reapply as necessary. I&#x27;d recommend giving this product a try, even if just for the scent! It&#x27;s very sensual.</li>
    <li> First of all, it has a nice pleasing smell.  I wore it in the company of three young men (younger than me). These young men were very nice, talkative, and very attentive to me.  This was not a social situation or an event where I was looking to meet someone.  I just applied the oil on before I left the house to run a few errands.  I would definitely  recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the scent is wonderful and I love how I feel after I put it on.</li>
    <li> This product has a light musky scent on my skin.  I&#x27;m sure it smells different on different folks, but it&#x27;s very light and I layer my own perfume over it.  It have noticed additional attention towards me when I do wear it.  Men seem to soften their demeanor when they are around me.  Those I work with seem to be more playful these days when I have it on.  I don&#x27;t think that it draws men like a moth to a flame, but those men who are around you seem to take more notice.  I would recommend this product.  I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work the same for everyone, so don&#x27;t just go by what I say.</li>
    <li> I got a rash from it. Mild but annoying. I&#x27;m sure it works (their other products do) but just not in my case. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry that this review is so late,I&#x27;ve had a few deaths in the family and my mind just wasn&#x27;t thinking about a review,better late than never and this will be an wholehearted honest review of my experience with this pheremone oil to attract men.This was sent to me to use and make an honest review so here goes.....I have tried quite a few man attracting pheromones in the past and some have been a fail,some have been awesome.....I have tried this pheremone in the spray version as well,it smelled very nice but didn&#x27;t last long at all,so it didn&#x27;t work,this pheremone oil lasted a long time for me,I was glad that I didn&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it,it smells very nice in my opinion..very sweet,warm,inviting,sometimes I wore my regular favorite perfume (Javon Musk) with it which made it even better,this did work around men cause I got more than plenty of attention while wearing it so yes this works,this would also put me in a better mood which I thought was a fluke but I didn&#x27;t wear it for a few days and when my kids had me stressed out to the max I put some on and I immediately felt better and was put in a very uplifting mood.It also made my kids calmer when I wore it.So wether you buy this to attract men or just for yourself,either way your a winner. This is actually a favorite of mine that I keep with me at all times.I hope this helps anyone who is trying to decide if buying this is a waste or not but its not a waste.</li>
    <li> When I wear this I have noticed that women are calmer and men are more likely to be sweeter to me. I love wearing it and the smell isn&#x27;t offensive to me at all.</li>
    <li> It might be my chemistry not meshing w/ product-but so far...sadly-zippo!!!!  I will try a few more times, then I&#x27;m trying other formulations</li>
    <li> I have only had this for 3 days but it has gotten me and my husband closer.  He wants to spend more time since I started using this.  It also has me feeling better about myself (maybe because of the attention I have been getting from my husband) but so far great product.</li>
    <li> I first bought the spray bottle of this and immediately ordered the oil right after! This stuff is amazing and smell is actually very pleasant. I recommend this to any female looking to get the attention she deserves!</li>
    <li> Pretty sure I used this as directed but didn&#x27;t seem to change anything. No worries that&#x27;s why there is the old fashion way :)</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my GF without her knowing. When I gave it to her she added it to my favorite fragrance that she wears. I&#x27;ve always had a strong sense of smell and this product enhanced my sensations when I am with her. Works really good!</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell and I did not attract absolutely anybody.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell but I have not seen any difference. I will try it again this week without my perfume to see if it will work.</li>
    <li> I like the scent; it&#x27;s fresh and clean. I didn&#x27;t notice any more attention from men.  I will change my rating if I do.  The good thing about these products is that they don&#x27;t seem to bother people with allegies.</li>
    <li> This oil version is stronger than the spray - and also lasts longer. The smell is the same, a subtle, pleasant, sweet and powdery smell that my bf and I both like. I will keep wearing it.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any effects while using this product. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be like an axe commercial (roles reversed) but something would have been nice.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell it gave me headaches and I did not find it effective at all .</li>
    <li> i love it... i mixed it with the perfume i am using... works for me...more confidence.. i will recommend it to my fds..</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!!! I got it cause I was curious and it was a great price, tried it, my husband could not keep his hands off me!!! It&#x27;s awesome and smells great to:)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really buy this to attract men, I bought it to see how it worked with the man I already have.  Though I haven&#x27;t had it for very long, the results I&#x27;ve seen thus far have made a believer of me!  ;)</li>
    <li> I bought; tried it and got to agree the scent goes away quickly. I get more reaction from guys when I use The Body Shop products like shower and lotion combo.</li>
    <li> So far I have noticed that my male coworkers appeared to notice me more and my small son was more affectionate and wanted to cuddle more which is out of the ordinary for him.</li>
    <li> oh well, after reading many reviews about this product, i decided to buy it , i&#x27;ve used half of the bottle without any good results, what a waste of my money</li>
    <li> The boyfriend is the unsuspecting victim! Ha!&lt;br /&gt;I spent the weekend at his house when i was first given this to test out. All I can say is HOLY CRAP!!! LOL!!!! I had to pry him off off me to leave Sunday evening to go home! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, it’s not very strong, but I don’t use a lot each time thou.  I do notice the difference, when I wear it, more guys are asking my name, and they introduce themselves to me.  I do not use it every day, and now even I don’t use it, I feel more attractive and confident.</li>
    <li> I think I am hyper sensitive to it, because the underlying scent is what I smell, not the perfume part. It to me has a very weird animal/urine/glandy scent. Sorry folks, just not for me. I asked others and they smell the perfume part, which isn&#x27;t bad. Nice and florally but I just get nauseous. Like I said, hyper sensitive I guess. Also, I did not notice a difference in my husbands response to me :(. Oh well. Love their other products though.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet how good it is working, for now I can say that it got me some more looks from men ;) I like the smell of it and that is it natural oil - no chemicals added as in case of perfumes. I prefer essential oils to perfumes.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Works great too!  I&#x27;m somehow more charming and get lots of attention when I have it on....unbelievable!  I love the scent, it&#x27;s very elegant.</li>
    <li> I like the word Sexyy and I like to feel Secy towards the opposite sex. I have noticed a few more giggles (at my jokes). The part that I dont lime is tbe closeness from men. I like my personal space.. But that doesn&#x27;t speak bad of the product just my silly issue. The smell on this is nice and not too overwhelming and I can still where it on my spots but still wear other perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again, there is a specific person who I want to see if it works with..knowing our attraction to one another already, I am extremely curious to how it works with him. The kind that I used before with him worked..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, its not bad.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice, but unfortunately, it does not work as advertised. Did not get any more looks than usual from men.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on it&#x27;s very sensual scent, it&#x27;s addictive! (Is it a self confidence (Placebo?) I don&#x27;t care, seriously,  I feel so sexy when I&#x27;m wearing it, my confidence increases and my body language pulses with relaxed Alpha Vibes. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s Self Fulfilling Prophecy, I believe it works and I smell sexy. It&#x27;s a win/win for me.  I have used it for years and have seriously reaped delusional success.   I&#x27;m getting my Valentine&#x27;s Day Gift Early!    ,</li>
    <li> I have to say that this product has a nice scent, but I think that you would have to get a man to get very, very close to you to enjly the scent, since it is not a strong scent.  However, if you are preparing for a special evening with a man who is going to be very, very close to you, I&#x27;m sure that he would enjoy this soft and feminine scent when he buries his nose in your neck!</li>
    <li> Like the smell. Warm and slight musk.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. It has a pleasant smell and working well. Try it! You will see! :-)</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> Just received product. I dont know if it works yet but it smells very seductive.I cant wait to test it. will update when I do</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the smell of this at all as I thought it smelled quite well. It certainly gives a lot of confidence when around men. I have noticed some differences in men around me, more friendly and such. Great product overall and the customer service of this company is amazing, very impressed with them.</li>
    <li> This smells good but I do not know if this stuff actually works or not. we will definitely see and I a hoping it does.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Comes out of the bottle more easily than another brand I have previously used. Not sure if it is placebo effect, but I like it</li>
    <li> When i first applied it, i could hardly smell anything so i shook the bottle and reapplied and this time i can smell it. i love it! it gives me a boost in mood and made me feel more confident. The scent last for like two hours so, you&#x27;ll have put it in your purse to reapply if you are going out. when i wore it to work the next day i noticed that my co-workers were a little more chattier. i will definitely buy again just for the way it made me feel.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.</li>
    <li> Yes, Yes, Yes!!!!!!!!! Yes, it works! You&#x27;ve got to try this. I purchased it years ago and had GREAT responses. Now that I&#x27;m older I wanted a bit more action and .... OMG! It works just as well as it did years ago!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing, it&#x27;s the first time I have used it, and not the last. A few dabs on the wrist and behind the ears goes a long way. The scent is nice, and the male attention I get when I&#x27;m wearing it, demonstrated exactly what it was advertised to do. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> To say I was skeptical about this product would be an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a gift for a bachelorette party though and I didn&#x27;t want to go with the typical penis shaped, poorly made knick-knacks that usually find their way to these sort of classy events. This was just the right mix of sexy and strange to be the coolest gift she received that night. The smell is pretty muted, sort of musky but soft. Hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to a couple days after the party and apparently her fiance keeps nuzzling her neck saying how amazing she smells when she dabbed it on (without telling him). A couple male coworkers warmed up to her a bit as well, and I think I&#x27;ve created a monster. Chick wears that stuff every day now. Something about her is a little more sexy, even to me. I think it&#x27;s the placebo effect creating a confidence that made her feel like she was exuding sex appeal. Confidence is always sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it was interesting to see a gag gift have such an impact on someone. For once something turned this skeptic into a believer.</li>
    <li> After only a few days I believe this is working for me. Prior to using this product, I thought my man was losing interest. Now that I am using this, I believe I have his attention.</li>
    <li> I have this item and the spray version. I think the spray work better but must be applied whereas the oil last longer.... Anywho I thought this product was poppycock snake oil or some type of gimmick but after two very out of the ordinary passion filled bouts with my BF I&#x27;m convinced!!! He&#x27;s normally lukewarm when it comes to passion or very basic but latey he&#x27;s been on fire can&#x27;t keep his hands off of me. It also does give you this strange since of confidence some how.... Will definitely order again but in spray for it works better for me.... Also the smell goes away after a while nothing too unbearable.</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;m a dancer I tend to make more money when I wear this. !</li>
    <li> Love  it!!! Definitely worth buying to see if it works. Great company.,,,best customer service ever.</li>
    <li> shipped fast but im still not sure if it works</li>
    <li> The oil worked well. I received complements from men on my sent. I am an exotic dancer and I felt that men agreed to spend money more quickly on me when I wore this. If you&#x27;re not careful you might apply more than you wanted to though because the oil does not spray out or roll on, when you take the lid off, the bottle is just open. I usually prefer sweet smelling perfumes so this one took me a little getting used to. The sent of this reminded me of something a much older woman would wear. I asked some male friends to tell me their honest opinion of what they thought of the sent, and they said they liked it. I applied the oil to the backs of both my ears, side of neck, inside of wrists and back of knees. When applying this amount 4 days a week the bottle lasted me about 3 weeks. I found the easiest way to apply this product is if you push the open bottle up against the part of the body you wish to apply it to and then flip the bottle over so the oil will make contact with your skin. Once the oil has touched your skin flip the bottle back upright. Make sure you don&#x27;t break contact with your skin until the bottle is back upright or it will spill out more than you want.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance but unfortunately it won&#x27;t last long and I didn&#x27;t get any comment at all.😕</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the scent of this pheromone spray, I&#x27;ve had others that I liked much better and cost much less.</li>
    <li> I purchased the purfume spray version of this product (female pheromones) and have reviewed that product as well. Here is my review for that particular product. Please feel free to read it before reading my review for the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I was a bit skeptical about a pheromone perfume, but my curiosity peaked and took a hold of me. I wanted to test it on my boyfriend, whom is affectionate enough on his own. I just sometimes crave his attention and like to get spoiled with cuddles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read previous reviews about the smell being very strong and almost pungent, so I did not spray the perfume on myself with the spray nozzle. Instead, I twisted the cap off and used the spray &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; like a dipstick and dabbed on some of the perfume on the side of my neck beneath my ears, my wrists, and my clavicle/bosom area. The smell reminded me of an older woman&#x27;s perfume; strong and floral. It IS strong at first, but after about 10 minutes the smell becomes subtle. I have grown to like it, actually. I&#x27;m more partial to fruity smells. The last time I used it, I actually sprayed it upon my chest/neck area, and dabbed my wrists. Like I said, I have grown to like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, does it really work? I honestly believe so. Since wearing it on an almost daily basis, my boyfriend (whom I live with) has been more physical. In example, he caresses my arm out of nowhere, walks up behind me and nuzzles my neck while I wash the dishes, and cuddles more while on the sofa while we enjoy our favorite shows/play video games. I also noticed other men (co-workers) being more chatty with me. I&#x27;m more of a social recluse at work, and try to retain a sense of professionalism, but I didn&#x27;t mind the small conversations during break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product to try it out, and so far I am very pleased with it. Like I previously stated, the smell was something that kind of threw me off a little at first, but I have grown to like it very much. If you use the &amp;#34;dipstick&amp;#34; method, the small bottle will last a very good while. I give it a 4/5 rating, based solely on the fact that the smell can be overwhelming at first, however, don&#x27;t let that deter you from purchasing this pheromone perfume. You&#x27;ll grow to love it&#x27;s scent, and It did technically &amp;#34;attract&amp;#34; men to me. Just don&#x27;t expect them to pounce and claim you.&lt;br /&gt; I wanted to try the oil product as well, since I really enjoyed the perfume spray version.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil version does not have much of a fragrance compared to the perfume. It is very subtle, and fades away with time. It&#x27;s very easy to apply: open cap, put finger on little nozzle, flip over with finger still on nozzle, flip back right side up and dab oil on pulse points (neck, lower neck/clavicle, and wrists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure, but I believe this version is a bit more potent with the pheromones. Upon wearing it the first night, my bf was very intimate with me. I really, really enjoyed the affection. I also feel it gives me a bit of a confidence boost. I love both products very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something subtle, I highly recommend the oil. If you want a very fragrant version, then I recommend the perfume. :)34;dipstick&amp;#34; method, the small bottle will last a very good while.

    <li> Scent like old lady&#x27;s perfume&lt;br /&gt;I use another perfume over it&lt;br /&gt;Seems to get some attention but only when I&#x27;m social situation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wear it out normally doesn&#x27;t seem to have a great effect</li>
    <li> All brands are NOT the same! My friend had a product by pure romance that I tried. It was shocking how men who didn&#x27;t seem to notice me before, started following me in pursuit. I gave this brand a try, the only thing following me is my obsessed male cat, it&#x27;s weird! Tried it 1/2 doz x&#x27;s, my cat gets creepy each time I put it on. Long story short, I threw it away. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I would have rated it NO STARS, a BIG -0- but wouldn&#x27;t let me.  Don&#x27;t Buy It!:(</li>
    <li> I used the oil on my wrists, neck and behind the ears, as prescribed. I followed up with my own perfume. The night I used the oil I decided to go dancing with a girlfirend of mine. I could not keep the guys off of me! Crazy! I mean they could not stay away. They were more attentive and sociable. Let me just say that I am an attractive woman, but the male response using the oil yielded more results than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my review on the spray - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H5YVRY3NHD6A</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very and my husband it&#x27;s better with me</li>
    <li> I was a total skeptic in purchasing this product, but so far when I&#x27;ve left the house with a few drops on my wrists and behind my ears, I&#x27;ve found myself a bit overwhelmed with people seeking me out both romantically and professionally. (And not just creepers) I really think this stuff works - it seems to really attract people for that initial point of contact.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in people reacting to me. I do like the smell. I was hoping for less conflicts at work as I work with strong personalities</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working or not...I used quite a bit of it too a few different times to test. It does smell off like many people say.  I let it steep a few minutes and then put my own perfume on and it doesn&#x27;t smell then.  From what I understand about pheromone&#x27;s (I could be wrong), the receiving person has to be &amp;#34;in the mood&amp;#34; for it to send them over the top to react. But I did notice a few males give me extra attention. Just not the one I was gearing towards.</li>
    <li> this did absolutely nothing for my relationship</li>
    <li> does as it says..was skeptical and did not belief so i bought it and now im convince it works. do have to admit howevermthat i had given a bad review because i thought it didn&#x27;t work since i bought it out of curiousity and have no trouble with  man. but when i wear this product some how guys are nicer and want to sniff me and want to conversate with me a lot.</li>
    <li> This is not true at all!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated so it lasts longer, I like the smell also!</li>
    <li> seems to be something to this.  Smells weird but I apply perfume after I put on and it seems to be fine.  Gives you more confidence somehow and seems to make people around you calm and friendlier.  I am still using it so I will update more later as I see how I like this product and how it works.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered real fast. From reading other customer reviews, I was expecting more from this product. I do like the smell though, my boyfriend likes it as well, couldn&#x27;t get enough of it. I have noticed a slight change in male and female behavior towards me, but nothing too intense. And I also noticed that my attitude and overall well being is better when I wear the oil. It does fade really fast, so I find myself re-applying it a lot. Anyways, fun little experiment. Don&#x27;t know if its worth $30 though.</li>
    <li> I smell this oil and feel good at first feeling.&lt;br /&gt;However, I wear it everyday and realize this smell like pee.&lt;br /&gt;I not sure for attracting men with this product.</li>
    <li> I see a real difference!  There is a definite difference in the attention.</li>
    <li> The oil, in compared to the spray, smells much more like baby oil. Sticks around a little longer, but seems to work about the same. Both the perfume and oil seem to have more of a relaxing effect than anything, which is equally good to me since relaxed men are typically more confidant.</li>
    <li> Heard good things about the product. Thought I&#x27;d give it a go as a birthday present to myself. Love the scent and so do all the men I come in contact with. I&#x27;ve noticed more people go out of their way to strike up conversation with me and I&#x27;ve caught a few more eyes than usual. Great product.</li>
    <li> It smells good but it could come in other scents. It seems to really work, the guys keep coming back and when to interact with me. :) It is a handy small bottle, easy to use, and stowe away in your purse.</li>
    <li> In his novel &amp;#34;The perfume&amp;#34;, Patrick Suskind underlines the importance of human smell when it comes aobut socially relating to others. Pheromones are very important. The product could be seen like a &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34;, but it´s not.; it made me feel more confident, I receive a better reaction from people in general, I feel likeable and it makes me feel good.  It could be like a natural remedy for shyness and social phobia.&lt;br /&gt;  We all have the right to feel good, to be well treated. And if it only takes you 2 drops of this oil, why not do it?  It´s never late.</li>
    <li> The oil has a subtle smell, that reminds you of a powdery bouquet of flowers.  I have also purchased the spray, but the spray has a much stronger smell.  Does it work?  It seems to make men more open to conversation.  I did notice a positive difference in mens&#x27; behaviors when I wear the oil.  I use it on my neck and wrists only, and have used it for about 2 weeks now.  Interestingly, I also have noticed that women tend to be more aggressive towards me.  I wonder...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it works in men who are emotionally unavailable.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s kinda tippy how this stuff works.. it&#x27;s like a love spell! I have been going threw a tough time with my boyfriend we were not seeing eye to eye on much.. I could feel we were lacking chemistry. I got this, it a river on time... I think it smells like incense and it&#x27;s pretty strong so I mixed some in a sweet smelling lotion... first thing my boyfriends said when he hugged me was mmmmm you smell soo good! And he just held on like he missed me!... I am shocked... so wonderful! I&#x27;m definitely going to buy again! I feel like I just got a secret wepon...</li>
    <li> My partner couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off me. We scheduled a lunch and only had 45 minutes to see each other. Rather than having lunch we had to sneak off to the car to rest our passions. So it did work. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t like the smell of the perfume that is added, but I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and use fragrance free products. People who enjoy perfume will probably like the smell. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> So I am 4 months pregnant and because I am no longer ovulating I am assuming based on scientific priniciples I am not putting off the same pheromones like previously around those times I used to track my ovulating schedule and would notice guys would be more nicer and attentive. So as an experiment I decided to try this A. to see if this works &amp; B. to get my boy friend out of his own &amp;#34;Male pregnancy symptoms&amp;#34; because quite frankly he is rather taking on most of laziness. Sooooo when I got this product I noticed 2 things..Its a small amount and the smell is god aweful. However that day I finally got laid after a week..twice..As for other men its been a mix review still havent tested it out. So I guess it works but I wont be buying it again unless I see anything significant happen</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this product, I read several of the reviews - some of which seemed far too good to be true.  But overall, the realistically-positive reviews outweighed the negatives and I decided to try PherX for the heck of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my experience in the past week of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in a heavily male-dominated career field. But due to the nature of my job, my coworkers are incredibly good at treating me like &amp;#34;one of the guys.&amp;#34;  And for the most part, I&#x27;m okay with being a &amp;#34;bro&amp;#34; in the office and on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my package, though, I couldn&#x27;t resist the temptation of wearing it out to an office party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience: Good overall.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a little boost in a party setting.  I blended two drops into lotion and put it on my neck and chest, and added one small drop to my leave-in conditioner because I once read something about pheromone production around the female scalp.  (Haha!  It could&#x27;ve been rubbish, but it seemed interesting enough to try.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The results were noticeable, but not MAGICAL or ASTOUNDING as some of the reviews claim.  It didn&#x27;t make my coworkers hang all over me, nor did I turn all eyes in the room - but there were changes in everyone&#x27;s behavior.  Several of them commented on how nice I looked - which is HIGHLY unusual for them.  Instead of the usual &amp;#34;bro banter&amp;#34; they seemed more inclined to tolerate me and my girlfriends (who were also wearing some ;D)  chatter about whatever WE wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice while dancing that one guy who got particularly close kept nuzzling my neck - which aside from being annoying was also slightly endearing and a testament to the product and its placement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the product /without/ alcohol involvement in a non-party setting.  In the office, everything was back to professionalism and polite distance.  I did note that the guys laughed more authentically at mybad jokes, and they seemed to speak more softly.  Instead of being treated like another guy, I was treated like a lady... (which I don&#x27;t think is as much fun, personally!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall - I&#x27;d wear this to a party setting in a heartbeat.  But it&#x27;s not for office use, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the PherX four stars for the strange, balmy-powder scent that I think is an attempt to cover up the tangy, acrid scent of what I assume are the actual pheromones.  It&#x27;s like trying to cover a black-eye with red lipstick.&lt;br /&gt; Thank goodness it blends easily with a couple of my perfumes, because I would not wear it alone.  I would prefer the funky pheromone smell alone to blend with perfume instead of having to worry about the bad floral-powder combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got the extra cash to toss around, I recommend giving it a whirl.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this or anything like this. After reading the reviews I decided I would give it a try. So far I have no complaints. My husband is a bit of a grouch and after trying this while around him he has been so calm. I have to believe this product is the reason for his change in behavior.</li>
    <li> I do like the fragrance but that&#x27;s all I can tell at this point.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product thinking that it would do something for a guy I like. I put it on and he did not seem to act any differently, but he did notice the smell. He said, &amp;#34;Babe, that&#x27;s intense.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I think that above all, using this product has boosted my confidence and therefore my attitude has changed. I have not seen men dropping at my feet yet! I am not sure if tis works yet. I am an attractive older female and I am trying this product. Si far it&#x27;s been exciting to be aware of the changes.</li>
    <li> After being married for 30 years, I thoought it was time to add a new spark.I didn&#x27;t tell my husband I was wearing the PherX. I sprayed some on his pillows too. At first I thought, oh great, I wasted my money. But within 3 days...... lets just say I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This works - no doubt - to the point I think it can be overpowering for some men that I ran into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought pheromones for my self-esteem, and I did attract men, dates, etc.etc. and if you need the extra kick, or just want to experiment, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember though, that you attract the reflection of yourself - always. You can&#x27;t get a good relationship unless you have a fantastic relationship with yourself first.</li>
    <li> I like the subtle fragrance, it&#x27;s not really noticeable. What was noticeable was the increased attention I received from men.</li>
    <li> So far I feel this stuff really works!!! I don&#x27;t know how far you have to be for them to smell it but it seems like they can smell me coming! I think I love it!! I even had my gay guy friend come talk to me 4 times just to be close... Lol he is never that touchy when he talks. I give it 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> Ladies keep your money, this item does NOT work. I used as directed, my friends tried it as well and none of us noticed ANYTHING claimed by the seller. We all just had a big laugh about it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if  you&#x27;re looking for it to be an &#x27;attraction potion.&#x27; It smells sweet and the claim that it&#x27;ll attract the opposite sex is false.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price the product doesn&#x27;t last long and the vile in very small</li>
    <li> Great product!!!! I absolutely love the sweet light smell a little goes a long way. I have noticed a good response from men I actually had one guy stare at me as he walked into the end isle at a store spilling his coffee everywhere... Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with my boyfriend, even tho I only tried like once or twice. So I stopped using it and I let it sit on my dresser for months, until my mom found it and I told her what it was. I gave some to her just for fun and she said my dad has been extremely affectionate and sweet ever since. Before he would rarely smother her with hugs and kisses, now he can&#x27;t keeps his hands off of her! She told me she&#x27;s starting to get annoyed now HAHA! I guess I gotta start trying it out again :-)</li>
    <li> The oil version stays longer. The only down side to it is the smell. After the first couple if uses it started to annoy me. Other than that, it worth trying.</li>
    <li> Just received, it is easy to apply, not greasy, absorbs into the skin. Has a nice smell, waiting to see what results will be.</li>
    <li> Ok, I just received my bottle of Pherx Pheromone Oil 2 days ago. The first day I wore it, my boyfriend told me he loved me for the first time!  Seriously!  Coincidence? I don&#x27;t know, but I have been waiting for him to say it for a while now (I didn&#x27;t want to be the first one to say it of course!), and then BAM...he has said it and he means it :-)  Very happy with this product, has a nice smell too. I did wear it with my favorite perfume. I would definitely recommend this product. 100% satisied.</li>
    <li> First off it does have a kinda funky smell to it thats why I gave it four stars, but it definetly had the fellas in an uproar. This will definetly become a part of my daily grooming habit. Many remarked how good I smelled...one of them damn near broke out in convolutions...and some couldn&#x27;t hide their erections. My friend couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off, he damn near humped me in the street.. I&#x27;m  naturally sexy anyway but this has given me one on everybody!</li>
    <li> smells great, can use other scents with it. small bottle, easy to use, no mess like an oil can cause</li>
    <li> I read quite a few of the reviews before deciding to purchase. My curiosity got the best of me. I thought the oil smells strange but my sister loves the scent. I have worn the oil at work for the past three days as an experiment. Day one was interesting. A man told me that All of the guys at work have a crush on me. Coincidence? Maybe. Had to try another day to be sure. Day two was uneventful so I had to try one more time to confirm. On day three I received more male attention than I can ever remember. Seems to attract men in droves. Love it! Only 4 stars because it smells weird</li>
    <li> It works! smells good, but more importantly is that you WILL get attention. Wear at your own risk and be ready to be chatty and responsive. I also layer another perfume that I like on top of this and the combination of scent works great. Best of both worlds since I get the smell I want and the attention that elevates my night.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know what to except but after seeing it in action I AM A BELIEVER. Women who knew me before I started using it suddenly started showing a lot more interested. I&#x27;m happy with the results Im getting.</li>
    <li> This product has a great smell, but I have not noticed any difference in the number of men I attract.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this. It has a musky smell. But I didn&#x27;t notice any men being attracted to it or me, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love the slight scent of this stuff and men seem to love it too! I think it makes people more friendly with you in my experience. I&#x27;ve never had trouble with that though. If nothing less it smells great, mixed with perfume good, and is fun.</li>
    <li> Ok, I read about Pheromones and had to try it out.  I have tested it twice, once at work, and once in a social setting.  In both instances, I found that men were just more open in general with me.  At work was the most surprising- guys who usually have two words between them were suddenly giving me full sentences!  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a magic potion and men are going to fall in love with you- but whether it&#x27;s a little help from the pheromones or the knowledge that I am wearing pheromones giving me a confidence boost, it definitely made these situations easier for me to handle, and I plan to continue use as I venture into online dating!~</li>
    <li> Ladies this is a must for women. My God I couldn&#x27;t believe it !!!  ones you wear this product doors open wide for you. Even women flatter you. I am not spring chicken at all and hate to tell my age. All I can say ladies go ahead and buy this product. Of course make yourself a bit desirable, groom your hair, soft make up and a nice perfume, don&#x27;t neglect your hands and feet, and VOILA you have it made with men and especially that someone you like, he&#x27;ll be at your feet in minutes. I guarantee it.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice I like it I havent noticed any changes only that my boyfriend is more loving and cute but not sure if because of pheromones or other thing soooo im not sure</li>
    <li> I received the product on time, everything was ok. I tried this product on top of the &amp;#34;aware&amp;#34; product, but I felt nothing. I tried by itself, expecting some reaction from my hubby (who is usually very loving, very touching and all) but instead he was &amp;#34;distant&amp;#34;!!! Oh no!!! It was a turn off!! Without the product... Oh yes... But with the product.. Not him, no body got attracted by me!!! Sniff, sorry, I don&#x27;t know if there is a blocking interaction with the other one, but... Nothing! Maybe it was just me... Who knows?? This one I think I won&#x27;t try again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do the trick...&lt;br /&gt;I also turned out to be allergic to it. I used it for a week and broke out in cyctic acne in the areas where I was applying the product. Now, a month later, Im still trying to get rid of the acne.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this product smells so strong it will completely overwhelm the smell of your perfume, if you are wearing one.</li>
    <li> Its been  3-4 days since this product arrived &amp; so far all I have noticed is that it smells like little old lady cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Unless I see some kind of response&lt;br /&gt;I wont be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;I could have used that 50 bucks for other things besides&lt;br /&gt;My grandmothers cologne.</li>
    <li> You will definitely notice a subtle difference in responses around you.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference the first night I used it.  I have used other pheromones in the past that were more expensive but this works just as well if not better! My husband, who has been a bit of a grump, lately was immediately more soft spoken and sweeter to me than he had been in months! I highly recommend this ;)</li>
    <li> the products is a greaT ,FEELS confortable with those,i recomendent pherx pheromones attract men..my costumer feels so happy,just wonderful thing,positive,sure is that good deals</li>
    <li> I like this oil formula better than the spray perfume because it&#x27;s definitely stronger but the scent is not as overpowering as the spray. I think it also lasts longer. As for how well it attracts men, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s soso. Definitely makes people friendlier around you though and the bf is more cuddly :)</li>
    <li> Great product, love it! Smells good and makes me happy when I use it.  As for attracting men, sure it works because I gave a sunny disposition because of using it and a smile on my face.  I do notice that people tend to look at me and smile, verses glance and look away. It comes out a little fast (as others have reviewed).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product multiple times now. I can definitely tell the difference around my boyfriend, he is so much more affectionate around me when I wear this. I cover up the smell with a nice perfume. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> My ex boyfriend used the guy version of this on me when we originally started dating, so when we broke up and i got back into the dating field, I thought I&#x27;d give the girl version a try. I added some of this to two of my favorite lotions and put a few drops of it on my dryer sheets so that it would be on my clothes wherever I went and would thus mingle with my natural smell, as well as whatever perfume or lotion I had on that particular day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I went out with a close straight guy friend. I&#x27;m going through a really stressful time, right now and his comment to me was, &amp;#34;Something about you seems different. You&#x27;re more . . . I don&#x27;t know . . . YOU, somehow. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve come back alive, again. I know what you&#x27;re going through and there is no logical reason in Hades that you should be acting this calm and cool and . . . sexy!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, everywhere we went, from eating at a local restaurant to shopping at local stores, men just seemed to flock to me and were being incredibly flirty and attentive. My friend asked me, &amp;#34;Did you get some new juju? Did you do something different with your hair? Is it a new perfume? What is up with this?&amp;#34; I just shrugged my shoulders, gave him a big old smile and said, &amp;#34;Sometimes women can be just magic. Don&#x27;t try to understand us, honey. Just know that we&#x27;ve got tricks up our sleeves that would completely baffle you if you knew about them.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey. . . if it works, it works. And there&#x27;s no need to give away the secret if you don&#x27;t want to. A little boost to the natural mojo a woman has? With this product, we are unstoppable! I was hooked with the guy version. Turn about is fair play. lol ;-)</li>
    <li> I just got this product so I cannot offer opinion as to results or experiences.  It did arrive as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the pheromones from this brand. They work. It&#x27;s not a crazy strong magnet but it will certainly give you an edge. You become more approachable if nothing else. Use it infrequently for lasting results.</li>
    <li> Feel like waste of money</li>
    <li> Seems to work with people I know.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m surrounded by people I don&#x27;t know and I had no trouble attracting guys to begin with so it&#x27;s hard to tell if I&#x27;m getting attention because of this or my personality (I like to think it&#x27;s the latter)!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been wearing this for about a week, though</li>
    <li> This product is great!! The oil essence last longer than the cologne spray. However, both seem to get the job done I just prefer the oil best!! Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Very good product,  nice clean scent and really helps lif your mood and gives you a boost in self confidence as well as attracting the attention of men around you. I recomend this product and have purchased about five times now.</li>
    <li> I can only speak for myself, you will have to give this product a try.  I always notice an instant improvement in MY mood and my partner does react positively.  I cannot say if his reaction is to my mood or to the pheromones.  For me it does not matter which, because I obtain my desired outcome.  I also notice that I receive more attention from other men too.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first to purchase this but let me tell you it works! Whenever I wear this, my boyfriend is all over me. A little bit goes a long way and I I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing this in the future!</li>
    <li> I was quite dissapointed. Not sure if the product was fresh. It smelled nice for all of 5 minutes after I put it on and then it was totally gone.</li>
    <li> I used to wear pheromone oils years ago when I was &amp;#34;on the dating scene&amp;#34; and I saw a significant difference then in the number of men who danced with/approached me when I was wearing the pheromones, versus nights when I wasn&#x27;t wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now married and hadn&#x27;t used pheromone oils in years.  But recently my hubby has been very busy with his business and our time alone has been less than thrilling.  So, I wanted to try pheromone oil to see if it would spark his interest, so I ordered this product.  IT WORKED.  From morning to night, my husband&#x27;s hands were all over me and he would opt to work beside me (we both work from home) rather than in his office in the basement.  He was sneaking kisses and I even caught him staring at me more than once.  This is my new little marriage secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula is the strongest I used.  It has a slight, but pleasant fragrance and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The scent for me is a distasteful fragrance. I&#x27;m not so sure how the aroma would attract someone if the smell does not agree with my natural fragrance :( besides, I have a husband and it had no effect on him at all :( sorry</li>
    <li> I have only tried it a few times, I have dabbed it at my wrists and neckline and ran through my hair after drying. I really haven&#x27;t noticed a big change but there are some subtleties I have noticed with the opposite sex. They talk much closer than without, and lots of their hands touching my arms or side during conversations. There is no smell that I noticed from the oil, I will continue to use to see if things change any.</li>
    <li> I do like this stuff.  The scent is not floral but something subtle, spicy herbal, and emphasize subtle.  But does it work?  Well it does for me.  To be absolutely candid, it may have something to do with the way I feel when I wear it.  The aroma lifts from my warm skin and makes me think erotic thoughts.  I&#x27;m sure that must influence my tone of voice and body language on some unconcious level -- which he would likely respond to.  And then again, perhaps it is the pheromones.  A good thing for couples of a certain age who haven&#x27;t had this much action in ages.</li>
    <li> Tried the oil for the first time yesterday.  After reading other reviews I only used 3 drops on pulse points - more and the smell is a little over powering.  After 2 hours added another couple of drops.  This was just right and I noticed it has a calming affect on me.  Went out and almost immediately men approached me.  Liked that their approach was sweet and attentive- not aggressive.</li>
    <li> Definitely works like it says it does, I do wish they would have said it came already scented.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it hoping to mix it with my own perfume.....&lt;br /&gt;(The product gives me a over 40 smell but it is light so i just spray my perfume over it)</li>
    <li> I like the soft smell of this oil.  I have noticed a change in how people respond to me.  My boss is even nicer to me.  I am not sure about my boyfriend.  He has not shown any change so far.  I say so far since I just started using it 2 days ago.</li>
    <li> Awesome product :-D PherX oil is the best I have used. The smell is good and it works chicas I&#x27;m 47 and I really think it works for women to even be nicer to me. I am very satisfied with this oil !es lo maximo!</li>
    <li> Girls, I love this product. I think that it is cumulative. I use it everyday. My beau constantly tells me that I smell so good. He says that  he can not define the scent but that it is provocative. I use just a tiny bit of the oil on my scalp, then behind my ears and then, again just a very very tiny bit on my face in the soft tissue area of my cheeks. All I can say is he tells me that he can not get enough of me, and when we are together he continually kisses and hugs me. The romance and our intimacy is off the charts!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it did anything.</li>
    <li> i bought this and im not sure if it works but i love the smell....id buy it again just cus i like the smell haha</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work as promised. I put it on and I get headaches.</li>
    <li> I received the product when promised. I seem to receive a lot of attention when I wear it. Smell is pleasant. So far I am pleased with the product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it works like it says, but it smells nice and accentuates whatever perfume you&#x27;re wearing anyway. I purchased it to see how my husband would react to it and the first day he did say I smelled nice.... He compliments me on my smell quite often anyway so I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just a gimmick.</li>
    <li> Has a nice smell.  Seems that people feel a little more at ease in my presence.</li>
    <li> It has a nice light scent - It quickly blends in and gives you an almost undetectable fragrance all around that men don&#x27;t consciously notice. I work in an office with a lot of people, and I can definitely tell a difference when I wear this. Men seem to linger around longer, and they really do hold doors open at every opportunity every time I wear this. I will add a more serious warning - don&#x27;t put this on right before getting in the car with a male driver; I&#x27;ve noticed any time I do that they&#x27;re a little more distracted and nearly run into curbs or other cars.</li>
    <li> Great product..... Works really well</li>
    <li> I was expecting something with a scent I would like after reading other reviews. Much to my delight, I like it. It makes me feel good and then just seems to blend into my body chemistry as the day goes on. I even wear it to bed some nights because it makes me feel good about me. My only suggestion would be more creative artwork and packaging that reflects a fragrance purchase. It&#x27;s in a bottle that makes it look like it&#x27;s a secret. No men swooning after a week, but I do really like it.</li>
    <li> There is nothing in this except bulls***</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work apparently.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle in the mail. I have used the spray bottle and it seems to work. I wore it to class one day, in hopes of attracting the guy I like. He kept staring at me and smiliing. I think he was a little confused. I also used this when my cute pest man made his three month visit and he was very chatty. I would like to point out that I am a very shy person when it comes to guys. Monday I will try with the oil and maybe I might get asked out. I will let you know.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! It smells a little &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; to me, but men always tell me I smell good when I wear it, so I guess it&#x27;s just a male/female difference of opinion.</li>
    <li> It does not have any scent at all.  I have not noticed any changes or any reaction in my husband.  I will give it. More day to test it.</li>
    <li> I love this...I put some on and went to class and every guy in my class moved to my side of the room. I had the girl next to me put some on and everyone was chatting with us while we chuckled about our little experiment. This product is great. Great customer service with this company and package arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought it for reason and it work perfect. Thank you for this powerful product!!!! Thanks thanks thanks</li>
