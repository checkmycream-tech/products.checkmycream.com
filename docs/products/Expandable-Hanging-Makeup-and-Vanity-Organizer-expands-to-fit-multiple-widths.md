      <li>These are fantastic!!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>So glad I did, though!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice item but the quality isn&#x27;t there.</li>
      <li>it is nice to keep things I need at hand.  </li>
      <li>It fits nicely and holds everything I need.</li>
      <li>This is great for making full use of your drawer space.  </li>
      <li>Very nice finish and useful.</li>
      <li>It makes my drawer look nice and clean, very easily to use.</li>
      <li>So I splurged on this more sturdy looking organizer.</li>
      <li>Had this item for over 1 year now and still just as satisfied with performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this, it works as advertised.</li>
      <li>I really do like this product it fits in the drawer great</li>
      <li>Love the product.  </li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s better than what it looked like before</li>
      <li>Fits on top of my deep desk drawer perfectly.</li>
      <li>This is a FANTASTIC product!</li>
      <li>I purchased two of these and love them.  </li>
      <li>I gave this four stars because I think it should lock into place better when adjusted because it moves and does not stay in place.</li>
      <li>It is kinda pricey, in my opinion, but I couldn&#x27;t find a better HANGING drawer organizer, so I went ahead and bought it for $25.</li>
      <li>Just wish it was better.</li>
      <li>buy more.</li>
      <li>I bought one of these and one of the InterDesign Clarity Expandable Organizer to see which one would work the best for my needs, and it works out perfect to have both due to the different sizes of compartments between the two!!  </li>
      <li>Easy Peasy, works just like I wanted.</li>
      <li>My stickies don&#x27;t fit in the square compartments.</li>
      <li>I wish that the rails on this accommodated a thicker width for my bedside cabinets to run securely atop of them.</li>
      <li>It would be great if the dividers were adjustable, but then it might take away from its solid quality.</li>
      <li>This thing is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I could fit it in my vanity drawer, as well as in my IKEA alex drawer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pricey, but worth it!</li>
      <li>Being able to put one on the bottom of a drawer &amp; have another hang from the top (&amp; slide front to back as needed) allows for tons of accessible storage.</li>
      <li>Nicely constructed and very expandable from letter size width to legal size plus.&lt;br</li>
      <li>PERFECT for my very deep bathroom drawer to help organize makeup and smaller items.  </li>
      <li>The sides move in and out and they fall out too easily and makes the whole thing collapse.</li>
      <li>At first I thought that twenty-five bucks was a lot to pay for this drawer organizer, but let me tell you, it is not!</li>
      <li>it fit very well built.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>The reason why I emphasized &amp;#34;hanging&amp;#34; was because you can find more affordable expandable acrylic organizers at Walmart for $10 or Target for $17, but the ends don&#x27;t hook down to hang the way this does, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would hang without retracting and falling.</li>
      <li>It would probably be best for deeper drawers, but works just fine on my fairly shallow drawer (3.5&amp;#34; tall inside) since I am only storing brushes underneath.</li>
      <li>It leaves the rest of the drawer underneath available for use while organizing your small office supplies on top.</li>
      <li>is quite a large drawer.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Well made, looks &amp; works very well.</li>
      <li>Crazy to think that with all the people and companies purchasing office supplies and organizers that this is the best we can do.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to using it</li>
      <li>This organizer is very well thought-out and engineered.  </li>
      <li>Sturdy and very practical.</li>
      <li>This one &#x27;hooks&#x27; over the edge of the drawer, rather than just sitting on top of it, so is a little more secure (as in the expandable slide doesn&#x27;t slip over time, requiring infrequent readjustment, as the other does), but this means that it will only accommodate drawer sidewalls of up to a certain width.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Perfect for my office drawer and many other uses.&lt;br /&gt;Adjusts to fit my shallow desk drawer and allows me to still see objects below.&lt;br /&gt;Expands to fit legal size hanger and still feels rock solid.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Well made, clever, increases drawer space.</li>
      <li>High quality and sturdy.</li>
      <li>I did also purchase two other US Acrylic products and they were fine.</li>
      <li>I obviously don&#x27;t have any first hand experience with how well that would work.</li>
      <li>The other one has a pebble ice-like embossed bottom, and I think the total clearness of this one looks a little better (personal preference), but that one will most likely look better over time, with micro scratches from daily use being less evident.  </li>
      <li>The pros - it expands and it is clear</li>
      <li>Actually I&#x27;m considering Ordering another as a 2nd would fit as well in the same drawer .It</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd review I have left for this product, what happened to the first is...........................who knows where it</li>
      <li>, it is exactly what I expected it to be and serves my purpose well.  </li>
      <li>Some of the compartments are too small to be very useful.</li>
      <li>I was really looking for something to provide a &amp;#34;drawer&amp;#34; that would slide back and forth over a deep file drawer, thus providing storage layering.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy, and if your filing cabinet is wide enough to allow you to expand the organizer to its maximum length, you can slide the main compartment to one end or the other, or put it in the middle.  </li>
      <li>Wish there was another in a more narrow width for those small bathroom vanity drawers I have.</li>
      <li>When I got a new desk recently, I got another to organize office supplies in the center drawer.  </li>
      <li>This way you can put things down in the drawer and add another layer making use of wasted space without piling things on top of each other.  </li>

<li> thick acrylic, high quality.</li>
<li> Otherwise the quality is as expected.</li>
<li> So not what I expected or need.</li>
<li> Anyway, the product arrived before I expected it</li>
<li> I got several of these a few years ago, and used them to organize jewelry in the drawers of my bedside table.  </li>
<li> The fixed compartments are too small for 3x3 sticky notes and the expandable compartment is too small for a sticky note pad (even when fully extended).</li>
<li> There was a slight crack on one of the two I purchased, so I won&#x27;t be putting anything heavy in it.</li>
<li> This organizer is of little use to me.</li>
<li> , I wish it was a little the compartments were a little deeper</li>
<li> I put my opened brush roll underneath it, and some everyday makeup in the organizer.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s my biggest complaint.</li>
<li> It is very shallow, so it fits into drawers where some organizers will not.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately when this arrived and I took it out of the box one corner was completely broken off.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product, very good looks and fanctions</li>
    <li> Love it! Great quality, wonderful for my make-up.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these and love them.  They work great in my bathroom drawers and don&#x27;t get in the way of the drawer closing at all!</li>
    <li> My stickies don&#x27;t fit in the square compartments. That&#x27;s my biggest complaint. It cannot expand the short way in the drawer so my stickies have no place to sit. I had to put it the long way and remove it every time I want to get at something underneath. Overall it&#x27;s fine. Just wish it was better.</li>
    <li> This thing seems to be made of bulletproof acrylic. It is very, very solid. I will buy a second one for another drawer. If you can afford it, buy it!</li>
    <li> I gave this four stars because I think it should lock into place better when adjusted because it moves and does not stay in place. Other than that it is very fictional for my needs.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product it fits in the drawer great, I wish it was a little the compartments were a little deeper</li>
    <li> Unfortunately when this arrived and I took it out of the box one corner was completely broken off.  I was really looking forward to using it but I sent it back.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. it fits perfectly in my filing cabinet drawer and I have converted it into a desk drawer to hold my pencils, pens, and paper clips. The plastic is solid and stays in place as needed.</li>
    <li> I wish that the rails on this accommodated a thicker width for my bedside cabinets to run securely atop of them. Otherwise the quality is as expected. There was a slight crack on one of the two I purchased, so I won&#x27;t be putting anything heavy in it.</li>
    <li> Easy Peasy, works just like I wanted.</li>
    <li> I had wanted something deeper. I was really looking for something to provide a &amp;#34;drawer&amp;#34; that would slide back and forth over a deep file drawer, thus providing storage layering.  I would have given this a 5 if all I wanted was a pencil drawer.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Purchased it for my desk at work and it&#x27;s perfect.  Looks great in my drawer and exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I use this to organize one of my makeup drawers. I put my opened brush roll underneath it, and some everyday makeup in the organizer. It would be great if the dividers were adjustable, but then it might take away from its solid quality. It would probably be best for deeper drawers, but works just fine on my fairly shallow drawer (3.5&amp;#34; tall inside) since I am only storing brushes underneath.

    <li> Sturdy and very practical. Unfortunately I had to return it because it didn&#x27;t fit my desk drawer to allow it to close.</li>
    <li> Crazy to think that with all the people and companies purchasing office supplies and organizers that this is the best we can do. All I can say is that this guy is the \\&quot;best\\&quot; compared to all the rest. It leaves the rest of the drawer underneath available for use while organizing your small office supplies on top. Also looks like it would work great in the bathroom for girls products and makeup, but being a guy I obviously don&#x27;t have any first hand experience with how well that would work.</li>
    <li> This is super awesome. It makes my drawer look nice and clean, very easily to use.</li>
    <li> At first I thought that twenty-five bucks was a lot to pay for this drawer organizer, but let me tell you, it is not! This thing is fantastic. Exceptional quality, sturdy, crystal-clear material. Fits on top of my deep desk drawer perfectly. Get it, you will be impressed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice item but the quality isn&#x27;t there. The sides move in and out and they fall out too easily and makes the whole thing collapse.</li>
    <li> I use this in one of my file drawers of my desk.  it is nice to keep things I need at hand.  It catches occasionally but it is just distracting not a problem</li>
    <li> This is good quality Acrylic. Arrived Quick,Fast, and in a Hurry and BEST of all it FIT my Desk Drawer !!! Actually I&#x27;m considering Ordering another as a 2nd would fit as well in the same drawer .It is quite a large drawer.</li>
    <li> This organizer is of little use to me. The fixed compartments are too small for 3x3 sticky notes and the expandable compartment is too small for a sticky note pad (even when fully extended). The slender compartments in the front are too short for pens or pencils. So not what I expected or need. For my needs, the organizer is useless. The pros - it expands and it is clear so I can see my sticky notes, pens, and pencils underneath, which is where they were before I bought this organizer.</li>
    <li> This is a FANTASTIC product! Well made, clever, increases drawer space. it&#x27;s pricey, but worth it!</li>
    <li> This organizer is very well thought-out and engineered.  It&#x27;s very sturdy, and if your filing cabinet is wide enough to allow you to expand the organizer to its maximum length, you can slide the main compartment to one end or the other, or put it in the middle.  Lots of possibilities!  I can&#x27;t find a single thing to complain about other than while it&#x27;s the brainchild of an American Company (US Acrylics in Libertyville, IL), it&#x27;s made in Taiwan.</li>
    <li> I got several of these a few years ago, and used them to organize jewelry in the drawers of my bedside table.  Being able to put one on the bottom of a drawer &amp; have another hang from the top (&amp; slide front to back as needed) allows for tons of accessible storage. When I got a new desk recently, I got another to organize office supplies in the center drawer.  It is very shallow, so it fits into drawers where some organizers will not.  Love it!</li>
    <li> thick acrylic, high quality. I could fit it in my vanity drawer, as well as in my IKEA alex drawer. May buy more!!</li>
    <li> Love this, it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very nice finish and useful. it fit very well built. High quality and sturdy. Expandable. Happy with this product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is great for making full use of your drawer space.  This way you can put things down in the drawer and add another layer making use of wasted space without piling things on top of each other.  It hangs on the drawer sides and is not too deep and you can slide it back and forth to get to the items underneath.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helpful, but not all-encompassing problem solving for my make-up drawer. Some of the compartments are too small to be very useful. Still, it&#x27;s better than what it looked like before</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd review I have left for this product, what happened to the first is...........................who knows where it is?&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway, the product arrived before I expected it, it is exactly what I expected it to be and serves my purpose well.  I love it!</li>
    <li> PERFECT for my very deep bathroom drawer to help organize makeup and smaller items.  I just wish they came in a couple of different depths so I could put things like my brush in them.  I bought one of these and one of the InterDesign Clarity Expandable Organizer to see which one would work the best for my needs, and it works out perfect to have both due to the different sizes of compartments between the two!!  The other one has a pebble ice-like embossed bottom, and I think the total clearness of this one looks a little better (personal preference), but that one will most likely look better over time, with micro scratches from daily use being less evident.  This one &#x27;hooks&#x27; over the edge of the drawer, rather than just sitting on top of it, so is a little more secure (as in the expandable slide doesn&#x27;t slip over time, requiring infrequent readjustment, as the other does), but this means that it will only accommodate drawer sidewalls of up to a certain width.  I&#x27;ve included pictures to help show how tall the lip of the tray is so you can see if it will work with your drawer, since that was a concern of mine I couldn&#x27;t seem to remedy prior to risking the purchase.  So glad I did, though!</li>
    <li> Hanging drawer organizer arrived cracked and chipped.  Returned the product.  I did also purchase two other US Acrylic products and they were fine.</li>
    <li> Update: Had this item for over 1 year now and still just as satisfied with performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for my office drawer and many other uses.&lt;br /&gt;Adjusts to fit my shallow desk drawer and allows me to still see objects below.&lt;br /&gt;Expands to fit legal size hanger and still feels rock solid.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Nicely constructed and very expandable from letter size width to legal size plus.&lt;br /&gt;Thick acrylic but arrived cracked.  No response from seller since I notified Amazon a week ago.  Only 2 stars until I get resolution.</li>
    <li> It is just what I needed for my desk drawer. It fits nicely and holds everything I need.</li>
    <li> Well made, looks &amp; works very well.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic!! Add an extra level of storage and they are beautiful and strong.</li>
    <li> This is nifty, I like that I can see through it and it fits my drawer just right. 4 stars because it slips around a bit.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality! Wish there was another in a more narrow width for those small bathroom vanity drawers I have.</li>
