<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Liked it, the smell was kinda strong.But it worked reay well.My hair and skin liked it</li>
    <li> This a great product if you have dry damage hair or it can be used for dry skin, the later is what I mainly used it for. This oil is perfect for calming frizzy split ends. I just squeeze a couple drops into my palms and rub into the ends of my hair before using the flat iron. It completely flattens out the ends and makes my hair look shiny smooth but not oily or heavy. The result is smooth, bouncy,shiny healthy looking hair. After I rub the oil into my hair, I just massage the residue on my hands into my cuticles and nails. It keeps the cuticles from cracking and looking raggedy between manicures.I received this product in exchange for an honest review, which may differ from yours. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I used personally..</li>
    <li> I looked at the description and figured I&#x27;ve got lots of those things so why not try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it a few days so I can&#x27;t testify to too many of them but I will share what I have been able to test so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frizzy hair - honestly this alone is worth having this product in our house.  My daughter has curly hair and just a little bit of this really tamed the frizzes!  It&#x27;s also been a very, very cold winter for us which means lots of static and dryness, so my straight hair has been out of whack with static and frizz and this treatment really helped!  And it only take a couple of drops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on my hands and fingernails, both of which are very dry.  Again, it only takes a couple of drops and it really makes a big difference in the dryness and nasty cracks and paper cuts on my hands.  I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Hair Oil Treatment at a reduced price for review purposes. All opinions expressed are my own and are unbiased.</li>
    <li> When it comes to products that claim to be all natural, I like to do my research and see if the ingredients really are natural and what are they supposed to do. This is kind of long, but I researched each ingredient so that others and I would know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil- (sunflower seed oil) It is a source of linoleic acid which is an unsaturated omega-6 fatty acid. It&#x27;s full of vitamins A, B1, B5, B6, and vitamin E. It conditions the skin and hair and protects hair from UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camelia Oleifera Seed Oil- This should be spelled &amp;#34;Camellia&amp;#34;. A minor mistake on the box. This is also known as Tea Oil. It is highly absorbant and used for dry skin and dry hair. This oil is rich in linoleic acid (omega-6) and oleic acid (omega-9). It&#x27;s also high in natural plant collagen and is one of the most skin-friendly oils. It actually absorbs to the lower layers of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil- This is high in Erucic acid which is another omega-9. It absorbs into the outer layers of the skin preventing dehydration. The oil closely mimics human sebum reducing oil production and has been compared to jojoba oil. It also makes a great alternative to silicone to smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil- Also known as Argan Oil or Moroccan Oil. It is rich in linoleic (omega-6) and oleic (an omega-9) acids. It protects from free radicals and is a great moisturizer for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tocopherol- This is structurally similar to vitamin E and has the same biological activity. I got this information from a medical dictionary. This can be derived naturally or be synthetic so I don&#x27;t know which tocopherol is in this product. Natural or synthetic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chitosan Succinamide- There is not much information about this on the web except that it is a film forming agent. I finally found an article about a form that is trademarked as a natural silicone replacement called Velsan Soft. This is supposed to act as an emollient and spreading agent. Velsan Soft is derived from the edible mushroon Agaricus Bisporus. This is known an inexhaustible resource. There is also Chitosan derived from marine sources. Velsan Soft provides the vegetable alternative to the marine method. I don&#x27;t know whether Velsan Soft&#x27;s Chitosan Succinamide was used in this product or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Reticulata Peel Oil- This is also known as Tangerine Peel oil. It conditions the skin, but it is mainly used for its citrusy fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Bergamia Peel Oil- AKA Bergamot Peel oil. This helps with skin conditions such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis. It is also used for its frangrance. The (BF) beside the ingredient means it is bergapten free. This is a chemical in the fruit that can cause high sensitivity to sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this oil in a few different ways. I have used it on my face, and my face is usually oily and very acne prone. This does not leave you feeling greasy at all. It has helped in controlling this oil in my face some and hasn&#x27;t caused my face to breakout. It has a light citrus smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I&#x27;ve used it on my hands that can get dry, and it has really helped. It doesn&#x27;t take much at all so a little goes a long way. My hands are a lot softer than before. I&#x27;ve tried it in my hair as kind of like a hot oil. I took probably about a teaspoon and added some coconut oil to it that I had melted. I applied it to the midlength of my hair to the ends. Then I wrapped my hair in a plastic bag, and then I took a towel I had ran under hot water and wrapped that around. The plastic bag is so the towel doesn&#x27;t soak up the oil. After letting it set for about an hour while I watched some tv, I washed it out. I could tell a difference in the smoothness and shine of my hair. I usually do the coconut oil by itslef, but adding this oil to it made it so much better. With the price and amount you get though, I could only see myself using this as a resorative oil for my hair. If you use itfor something like your face, it takes much less oil.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free for my honest review. This is my opinion after receiving and testing the product myself.</li>
    <li> My mom has super dry itchy skin. She spends tons on lotion but I thought that this would work better. And it did! This miracle bottle has some great features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Has no scent so you aren&#x27;t smelly all day long&lt;br /&gt;- Absorbs into the skin quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use pump bottle, 1 pump is the perfect amount for the hands&lt;br /&gt;- No parabens of alchohol, just quality oils&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way, this bottle will last a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is mostly organic and has so many uses. I like to put a few drops in my bath and my skin is soft and moisturized afterward even with our super hard water. I&#x27;m so glad I received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This is definitely stuff I am going to keep around</li>
    <li> Great hair, skin, and nail oil! The ingredients list for this oil is very impressive! I use bergamot, tangerine, geranium essential oils separately for hair, skin, and nails, so that piqued my interest in this blend of oils. I never use creams or body lotions when high quality oils like this do a much better job of keeping skin healthy and hydrated.</li>
    <li> This Natural Psoriasis - Eczema Treatment by Naturally Mediterranean has changed my life for the better. I have had eczema for as long as I can remember and it&#x27;s nearly driven me insane over the years. I have found little relief through any previous products.  This amazing infusion of 8 oils not only helps during extreme flare-ups but also helps me to prevent them when I use it daily as a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light scent from the various oils that quickly fades away as your skin absorbs it.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone with itchy skin issues among others!  I gave some to my best friend to try for her heat rash and it cleared it right up!! This will remain in my purse and medicine cabinet for years to come I am certain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my first bottle at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have not tried this product yet.  I did ask a question about suitability for me.&lt;br /&gt;I wish to thank the 4 people who took the time to answer my questions.&lt;br /&gt;All of your replies to me are very, very helpful.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem any different than any other product  for the price but is ok and will  probably not buy it again</li>
    <li> The scent is quite pleasant, but I can only use it on my skin, it&#x27;s way too heavy for my already limp hair. I don&#x27;t regret buying it but I had more expectations.</li>
    <li> It is lovely for the skin and hair. I&#x27;ve been struggling with cracked heels all my life. This past year they&#x27;ve gotten worse.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only thing that helps. A little goes a long way! So happy its natural :)&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my face, on my hair. It&#x27;s truly amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it! you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is toooo oily</li>
    <li> This oil has such a relaxing smell, I&#x27;ve been using it on my body and love it. It&#x27;s not greasy but leaves your skid so moist and smooth.</li>
    <li> I like this magic oil. I use alot of argan and I wanted to give this a shot since its a combination of 8 different beneficial oils. It&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients which it very important to me. I love to use this on my skin and my hair. It&#x27;s great on the hair to keep it shiny and healthy and tame the frizzies. Just steer away from putting alot on the roots. It makes skin soft and smooth. I would have liked a scent maybe added to this, but it&#x27;s still very nice. I am happy to recieve this magic oil to review.</li>
    <li> Good for dry cracked skin</li>
    <li> This product is just like it says! It&#x27;s a magical oil. It makes my hair so much smoother and I flat iron my hair almost everyday so this product just helps so much. I find that it actually helps a lot with frizzy hair and split ends. I don&#x27;t have extremely frizzy hair but usually the ends a little frizzy sometimes but after using this product it&#x27;s not frizzy anymore! I love how it isn&#x27;t extremely oily and heavy on my hair but it keeps it shiny.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair and after 2 weeks, I feel my hair is really soft and not fizzy anymore. The oil itself doesn&#x27;t smell really good, but I take it is because all the ingredient used are natural, no chemical or scent added. I also apply a little on my hand/finger, hand is not as dry, nails look healthy n shinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
    <li> I have tried everything this product is amazing. I highlight my hair so it is slightly damaged I use this and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband as his scalp and hair is very dry.  This has helped him quite a bit.  Purchased the shampoo, conditioner and the creme to go with this lotion.  It has been helping him with the dryness, will post later as he uses it more and more.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try out a new product to try and tame my frizzy hair. This oil works wonderfully, I used it after I straightened my hair and it smoothed the fly aways and kept it looking soft and smooth. I have also used this product on my hands and feet. With it being winter, my hands and feet are extremely dry and beginning to crack. I have been applying this oil for about 4 days and it has made them very soft and I have not had to deal with them cracking. Overall, this product works like a charm, and I cannot wait to try using it for other things. I would say the only negative remark I have about this oil is the smell.. it&#x27;s not awful ..it&#x27;s just kind of a musky woody smell that I was not fond of but it really does not linger so horray for that!</li>
    <li> This is a magic oil, it smells good and make the hair very smooth. I put this oil on my hair at night and the hair didn&#x27;t  tangle  at all the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;If I have  to  criticize, the price is a bit expensive for such a small amount. But overall, this is a very good product</li>
