      <li>Best of all, it smells great too.</li>
      <li>I am in my fifties and have a beautiful complextion.</li>

      <li>Happy I got it on a good sale</li>
      <li>I need all the help I can get, this gel goes on smooth and feels wonderful.</li>
      <li>Eye cream rub on the eyelids, absorption particularly good.</li>
      <li>This cream is good for the texture and how it glides on and soaks in nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a better treatment for my buck!</li>
      <li>I have used this before and reordered because I do think it is effective.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Premier products for amout 8 months and love them, my skin has never looked so good.</li>
      <li>Used together with the full eye care set, you get great results.</li>
      <li>I love the tube and application process, the cream is light weight and feels so good</li>
      <li>I love the creamy texture and it penetrates very easily.</li>
      <li>I first bought this item in the mall and was so happy to see it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Also very comfortable.</li>
      <li>I do like it, except I expect to wake up every morning and find the lines disappeared more like they were after I applied it.</li>
      <li>and I love the results.</li>
      <li>I really love this product for my eyes.</li>
      <li>This gel is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>and my eyes look OK again.</li>
      <li>this is okay</li>
      <li>You need something like this :)</li>
      <li>The price is fantastic for what you get!</li>
      <li>Hope more and more.</li>
      <li>I might have had better to say if they had just made an effort to help me in any way.</li>
      <li>but I like others better</li>
      <li>Love the way it makes the area around my eyes look and feel.  </li>
      <li>I have only used the product 3 times, but it goes on beautifully, feels great, and disappears quickly.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, it is not highly fragranced.</li>
      <li>I once in awhile try other products, but stopped because this is the best for me.</li>
      <li>I have to say it is a bit too light for me.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product while in Las Vegas and have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product  because of the great reviews and, after 4 weeks using it the skin around my eyes was extremely dry and dehydrated.  </li>
      <li>It was great to find the exact same product on amazon at a reduced price without any change in quality.</li>
      <li>but it really works a lot better</li>
      <li>It feels so refreshing putting it on and really decreases the wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was quick.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much at all to improve the fine lines and darkness under my eyes.</li>
      <li>It is so worth the cost.</li>
      <li>At the Mall in Albuquerque I purchased about 2,000 dollars worth of this product.</li>
      <li>This anti-age cream has been useful in eliminating those pesky crows feet.  </li>
      <li>It is  worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Non-greasy easily absorbed cream gel.  </li>
      <li>and she promised to make it right with me.</li>
      <li>This is the only stuff I have been able to find that will decrease the appearance of my laugh lines around my mouth and eyes.  </li>
      <li>Not the real thing!</li>
      <li>The gel feels nice on the skin, and it does moisturize the eye area, but I don&#x27;t feel it sinks in as well as the eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to a woman in her later thirties to start using instead of waiting until you get get more defined lines.</li>
      <li>I use the Dead Sea lotions and have loved them.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend the product--takes away the fine lines and reduces age appearance by ten years--well worth the money.</li>
      <li>This cream really does reduce the under eye puffiness...</li>
      <li>It really makes wonders to your eyes.  </li>
      <li>I am copy pasting this to the other products so that I can try to help others to make a more informed purchase.</li>
      <li>It feels a little cool when you first put it on, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a fragrance.</li>
      <li>and I can confidently say that my crows feet around my eyes are less apparent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used an eye cream until now, and within the first week the reason I sought such a product as this has been remedied.</li>
      <li>This product is fine, but I prefer the Premier Dead Sea Eye Cream.  </li>
      <li>So far I have been using this product for 2 weeks</li>
      <li>I am 24 years old, male.</li>
      <li>this product came in a broken box with no warranty seal, there is no way of knowing if it is really brand new and an original product, and not filled out.</li>

<li> I use it over a Premier Dead Sea Eye Serum because I need all the help I can get...</li>
<li> I use it with the Premier Dead Sea Biox Intensive Age Serum, and Premier Dead Sea eye serum with cream.  </li>
<li> In the mean time I opened some of the other products to use them.</li>
<li> I didnt do any research which I usually do, about these products, or I probably wouldnt have ever even tried them.</li>
<li> At least they didnt with me.  </li>
<li> Bought a lot of support, Tun hurry slowly.</li>
<li> They do not stand behind what they are selling in the least.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed sagging under my eyes, puffiness, and at times just an unhealthy look.</li>
<li> Not impressed for the price.</li>
<li> /&gt;anyone can check the safety of a cosmetic product trough its ingredients here : [...]</li>
<li> Instead of seeing an improvement my eyes never looked so bad!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of the few eye treatment creams I&#x27;ve found that really works.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of it either and the tube lasts a long time.  It is so worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy easily absorbed cream gel.  Love the way it makes the area around my eyes look and feel.  I&#x27;ve only been using for a short time but it does seem to help diminish bags under the eyes.</li>
    <li> This gel is fantastic!  The price is fantastic for what you get!</li>
    <li> Very great the cream gel. But there is a problem, the product does not have 0.5 oz. The amount  of product is less, is around 0.25 oz.</li>
    <li> This cream really does reduce the under eye puffiness...great stuff&lt;br /&gt;Will order again and again 😀</li>
    <li> At the Mall in Albuquerque I purchased about 2,000 dollars worth of this product. When I got home over 200 miles away I found that I had not made it home with all of the things I was supposed to have. I called the representative to let her know and she promised to make it right with me. She didnt.  In the mean time I opened some of the other products to use them. One was opened and used, one had the seal broke and had leaked in the box.   I contacted the company and told them what had happened and have had no reply what so ever. This was in September or October, and there still isnt any word from any of them. If you decide to purchase any of these products don&#x27;t depend on any one helping  you with what ever is the matter. They do not stand behind what they are selling in the least. At least they didnt with me.  I might have had better to say if they had just made an effort to help me in any way. I would not recommend these products. There is very little about them on the net too. I didnt do any research which I usually do, about these products, or I probably wouldnt have ever even tried them. I am copy pasting this to the other products so that I can try to help others to make a more informed purchase.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected.</li>
    <li> So-so. Happy I got it on a good sale or I would have been upset! Kinda like vaseline. I have been using a month and I see no difference and my lines are minimal..I&#x27;m still looking for a better treatment for my buck! Don&#x27;t pay over 15 bucks!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to a woman in her later thirties to start using instead of waiting until you get get more defined lines. I do like it, except I expect to wake up every morning and find the lines disappeared more like they were after I applied it. I am in my fifties and have a beautiful complextion. I do use the creams of this product on my face and it looks creamy and silky!</li>
    <li> I bought this product  because of the great reviews and, after 4 weeks using it the skin around my eyes was extremely dry and dehydrated.  Instead of seeing an improvement my eyes never looked so bad! So I started re-using the Rilastil products I used before this one and my eyes look OK again. Save your money.  This product does NOTHING for your eyes.</li>
    <li> The product met all my expectations and beyond. Shipping was quick.  I have no complaints at all.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I first bought this item in the mall and was so happy to see it on Amazon.  This is the only stuff I have been able to find that will decrease the appearance of my laugh lines around my mouth and eyes.  It has also worked on my forehead to reduce the expression lines I have.  One tube has lasted me little over 2 months.  You do not have to put a lot on.  I use it with the Premier Dead Sea Biox Intensive Age Serum, and Premier Dead Sea eye serum with cream.  The combination works and have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was totally amazed when I tried this product at a demo at Calgary airport.  I did order online and received the products and have not been nearly as impressed.  I am still wondering why the results were not the same.</li>
    <li> The name says it.  It is an intensive age treatment eye cream gel.  It really makes wonders to your eyes.  It is  worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I really love this product for my eyes. I once in awhile try other products, but stopped because this is the best for me. I also buy this in multiples because I cannot run out!!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of wrinkles on my skin under my eyes. This cream is good for the texture and how it glides on and soaks in nicely. I noticed maybe after 3 weeks a slight change in my wrinkles but I think Oil of Olay is best.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product while in Las Vegas and have used it for years.  It was great to find the exact same product on amazon at a reduced price without any change in quality. Highly recommend the product--takes away the fine lines and reduces age appearance by ten years--well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love the creamy texture and it penetrates very easily. Will definately buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is fine, but I prefer the Premier Dead Sea Eye Cream.  The gel feels nice on the skin, and it does moisturize the eye area, but I don&#x27;t feel it sinks in as well as the eye cream.  It feels a little cool when you first put it on, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a fragrance. Maybe if I used it over a longer period of time I would notice results, but for now my preference is the eye cream.</li>
    <li> Not the real thing! Didn&#x27;t have the same effect as the one I purchased at the Premier outlet.</li>
    <li> this is okay but I like others better</li>
    <li> This anti-age cream has been useful in eliminating those pesky crows feet.  I use the Dead Sea lotions and have loved them.  I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> I have used this before and reordered because I do think it is effective. I use several of Premier Dead Sea products.</li>
    <li> the 3rd ingredient of this product is sodium acrylates copolymer, not the mud and minerals of dead sea as I would expect since this product is advertised as a Dead sea benefits source. I should have done a research on the ingredients of this eye cream before buying it. It is not about money, because I paid the Amazon price, it is about health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyone can check the safety of a cosmetic product trough its ingredients here : [...]</li>
    <li> Not impressed for the price. Didn&#x27;t do much at all to improve the fine lines and darkness under my eyes. I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Premier products for amout 8 months and love them, my skin has never looked so good.</li>
    <li> I am 24 years old, male. I&#x27;ve noticed sagging under my eyes, puffiness, and at times just an unhealthy look. I&#x27;ve never used an eye cream until now, and within the first week the reason I sought such a product as this has been remedied. Although my review is a bit shallow bc of how briefly I&#x27;ve used it, I see no reason why I will continue to use this product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I need all the help I can get, this gel goes on smooth and feels wonderful. Best of all, it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Bought a lot of support, Tun hurry slowly. Eye cream rub on the eyelids, absorption particularly good. Also very comfortable. Price volatility is a little big. Hope more and more.</li>
    <li> So far I have been using this product for 2 weeks and I can confidently say that my crows feet around my eyes are less apparent. It&#x27;s not a miracle product but it really works a lot better then the Arbonne RE-9 Eye Cream that I used to use. I love the tube and application process, the cream is light weight and feels so good once applied. I use it over a Premier Dead Sea Eye Serum because I need all the help I can get...once you turn 40 look out! You need something like this :)</li>
    <li> I have only used the product 3 times, but it goes on beautifully, feels great, and disappears quickly.  I am optimistic about the longer term effects.</li>
    <li> this product came in a broken box with no warranty seal, there is no way of knowing if it is really brand new and an original product, and not filled out.</li>
    <li> I have used these products for over a year now and I love the results. I look younger, even my kids could tell the difference! Used together with the full eye care set, you get great results.</li>
    <li> I have to say it is a bit too light for me.  I have to apply several times in a day.  It is still a very good product to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> Perfect as described.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  It feels so refreshing putting it on and really decreases the wrinkles.  Best of all, it is not highly fragranced.</li>
