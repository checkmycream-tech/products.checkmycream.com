### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These peel-off polishes are perfect for her.  </li>
      <li>My daughter loved it!</li>
      <li>Great color selection for kids.</li>
      <li>the colors are bright even with just one coat.  </li>
      <li>My niece loved it..</li>
      <li>Very cute.</li>
      <li>Very cute product..</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll probably buy more when we run out!</li>
      <li>We allow our children to paint our nails and their own, and that often means we get it all over our fingers and toes.</li>
      <li>She can do her own nails and then just peel them off.  </li>
      <li>I am hoping this issue can be resolved as the items are hazardous and can not be returned in the mail.</li>
      <li>Polish stays on fairly well, but removes/peels easily when desired.</li>
      <li>These are really perfect for my 3 year old.</li>
      <li>colors are so nice for young girls - bright!</li>
      <li>We have gotten nail polishes before that peel off and if this had better packaging then the cons might not even have been an issue.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure she doesn&#x27;t mind about it cracking and what not...</li>
      <li>polish was better than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>I bought this for party favors at a party, it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s non-toxic and does not require use of nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>the 3 others are ok</li>
      <li>The other colors were perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So easy.  </li>
      <li>but the polish peels off very quickly after applied.</li>
      <li>Also, they clump really easily</li>
      <li>They peel off just fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>We still use those three today (3 months later) and they work great.</li>
      <li>I enjoy what they enjoy.  </li>
      <li>My triplets will enjoy painting their hands and feet.  </li>
      <li>However my 2 year old twin daughters loved the nail polish and it did peel off as advertised.</li>
      <li>and I was able to scrape it right off.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to rinse it right out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall,  i love the polish and my girls love having their nails painted and will most definitely buy again when they run out.</li>
      <li>peeling does come off clean and easy.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
      <li>colors are bright and you only need to apply 1 coat to see the colors</li>
      <li>It comes off quickly and cleanly.</li>
      <li>we were so excited to get this because the nail polish peels off, so my daughter can try painting our nails and we don&#x27;t have to worry if she gets it all over our fingers, it just comes right off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good fine motor activity, and she is building the skills necessary for me to trust her with real nail polish someday soon.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about going after her with the nail polish remover because the polish just comes off on its own after a short time.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the time and money to return.</li>
      <li>it does dry quickly which is nice.</li>
      <li>She paints her nails herself and then peels them right off to repaint them.</li>
      <li>For now, when this nail polish spills on our laminate floor, it peels right off.  </li>
      <li>broke off from the cap the first time we used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>there are many others out there that actually work.</li>
      <li>My girls are almost 2.5yrs old and thought they&#x27;d enjoy having their nails painted.  </li>
      <li>The only cons are that it does not come out of fabric easily</li>
      <li>she has certain &#x27;nail polishing clothes&#x27; that has nail polish all over it.</li>
      <li>but I found if I put a drop of water in the container and shake really well</li>
      <li>Definitely not for older girls who may expect their manicure to last a while, but perfect for little ones to play.</li>
      <li>The colors are rich and require only one coat.&lt;br /&gt;Dries faster</li>
      <li>All things considered, though, it is a MUCH better option than real polish for a little kid and</li>
      <li>When not peeled off by the wearer, the polish is pretty good about staying on for a few days, depending on the child&#x27;s activity level, time spent in water, etc.</li>
      <li>About half of the polish colors were chunky and the other half were perfect.</li>
      <li>than I expected given peel polish is thicker than regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;Peels off easily but doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
      <li>Since they are so young</li>
      <li>I bought these to use at a 7 year old birthday party.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps old??</li>
      <li>It goes on nicely, is thick enough that you don&#x27;t have to do a ton of coats and peels off so easily!</li>
      <li>The ones that are not dried out are brilliant but this was very very disappointing for the kids with unusable polishes.  </li>
      <li>We didn&#x27;t even get a chance to try these polishes, they were totally dried out the very first time we opened them.  </li>
      <li>Of course that included the pink and purple colors that my daughter really wanted.</li>

<li> (so have your kid wear a drape and don&#x27;t let them paint nails on the couch), and it&#x27;s sometimes more difficult to remove if it is left on too long.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The only issue I had is the red polish was already dried out when I got it which is why I only rated it as 4 stars.  </li>
<li> 3 of the bottles were dry out ..</li>
<li> ie the content of the paint is dry you can not use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your attention</li>
<li> Definitely a bust of a present, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> Total mess waiting to happen.  </li>
<li> My daughter is obsessed with painting her nails, and she wants to do it herself -</li>
<li> Not worth it</li>
<li> She has kept them in her little &amp;#34;beauty shop&amp;#34; and used them regularly over the past few months.  </li>
<li> I assume this was because the company did not screw the lids on tight enough?&lt;br /&gt;-one of the nail polishes brush</li>
<li> This product is not recommendable; half of the bottles were dried out and unusable.</li>
<li> She spilled a little on her clothes</li>
<li> She splattered a little on the tile floor</li>
<li> These were dried up and could handly paint them on my little ones fingers.  </li>
<li> 3 out of the 6 colors were dried up and unusable.</li>
<li> Three out of the 6 bottles were dried out.  </li>
<li> A few of the colors were dried up when the package arrived, but Amazon replaced them.</li>
<li> However the green polish came all dried up.  </li>
<li> /&gt;-two of the nail polishes were dried out and crusty and we couldn&#x27;t use them to paint with.</li>
<li> but 2 of them were dried out and they also come off in the bathtub..</li>
<li> My 2 year old was very sad that they came off in the tub.</li>
<li> it at least reduces the amount of clumps.</li>
<li> The kids were so disappointed that when they went to open them 5 of the 12 polishes were all dried out.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure about the other bad reviews.</li>
<li> i just seem to be polishing nails every day because it doesn&#x27;t last :(</li>
<li> Sadly... it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but it says to put 3 coats which is crazy and after one coat  in the bath it just peel off ..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My triplets will enjoy painting their hands and feet.  I enjoy what they enjoy.  This is a gift for them.</li>
    <li> some of the bottles were congealed.</li>
    <li> My daughter is obsessed with painting her nails, and she wants to do it herself - but she&#x27;s only 5!  Total mess waiting to happen.  These peel-off polishes are perfect for her.  She can do her own nails and then just peel them off.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about going after her with the nail polish remover because the polish just comes off on its own after a short time.  She spilled a little on her clothes and I was able to rinse it right out.  She splattered a little on the tile floor and I was able to scrape it right off.  So easy.

    <li> These were dried up and could handly paint them on my little ones fingers.  All clumpy.  Perhaps old??</li>
    <li> I bought this for party favors at a party, it&#x27;s ok i guess.. you have to use three coats for it to look like something. and its not the smoothest of polish.</li>
    <li> Very cute. My niece loved it.. I&#x27;m not sure about the other bad reviews. But she is only four so I&#x27;m sure she doesn&#x27;t mind about it cracking and what not...</li>

    <li> We didn&#x27;t even get a chance to try these polishes, they were totally dried out the very first time we opened them.  Amazon won&#x27;t accept returns for &#x27;toxic&#x27; substances so we can&#x27;t even return this junk product.  Definitely a bust of a present, don&#x27;t waste your money there are many others out there that actually work.</li>

I had to toss them as soon as we opened them and tried it. I assume this was because the company did not screw the lids on tight enough?&lt;br /&gt;-one of the nail polishes brush broke off from the cap the first time we used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So out of 6 polishes, only 3 were usable. We still use those three today (3 months later) and they work great.</li>
    <li> 3 out of the 6 colors were dried up and unusable. Of course that included the pink and purple colors that my daughter really wanted. I do not recommend this product. Amazon did give me a 50% refund.</li>
    <li> My girls are almost 2.5yrs old and thought they&#x27;d enjoy having their nails painted.  Since they are so young I didn&#x27;t want a polish that needed a remover.  I remember using a peel polish when I was a kid so tried to find the same for my girls.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t actually purchase these for them their Aunt did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish was better than I anticipated. The colors are rich and require only one coat.&lt;br /&gt;Dries faster than I expected given peel polish is thicker than regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;Peels off easily but doesn&#x27;t rub off. It does wash off in the tub though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had is the red polish was already dried out when I got it which is why I only rated it as 4 stars.  The other colors were perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  i love the polish and my girls love having their nails painted and will most definitely buy again when they run out.</li>
    <li> Very cute product.. but 2 of them were dried out and they also come off in the bathtub.. overall.. I dont think I would order them again. My 2 year old was very sad that they came off in the tub.</li>
    <li> Three out of the 6 bottles were dried out.  I would not recommend this product.  However my 2 year old twin daughters loved the nail polish and it did peel off as advertised.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it! no need to use acetone to remove it, simple as peeling it off when done playing.</li>
    <li> These are really perfect for my 3 year old. She LOVES them. She paints her nails herself and then peels them right off to repaint them. The only downside is I can&#x27;t seem to get it off clothing. So now I she has certain &#x27;nail polishing clothes&#x27; that has nail polish all over it. Also, they clump really easily but I found if I put a drop of water in the container and shake really well it at least reduces the amount of clumps. But in the end, my daughter loves them. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my four-year-old, who loves doing nails and styling hair.  She has kept them in her little &amp;#34;beauty shop&amp;#34; and used them regularly over the past few months.  We have all had our toenails painted in a rainbow (including Dad!) multiple times.  She sits and paints her left hand, then peels it off and paints it again.  It&#x27;s a good fine motor activity, and she is building the skills necessary for me to trust her with real nail polish someday soon.  For now, when this nail polish spills on our laminate floor, it peels right off.  The only cons are that it does not come out of fabric easily (so have your kid wear a drape and don&#x27;t let them paint nails on the couch), and it&#x27;s sometimes more difficult to remove if it is left on too long.  All things considered, though, it is a MUCH better option than real polish for a little kid and the colors are bright even with just one coat.  We&#x27;ll probably buy more when we run out!</li>
    <li> This is our second time to buy this polish. It&#x27;s fantastic. It goes on nicely, is thick enough that you don&#x27;t have to do a ton of coats and peels off so easily! We allow our children to paint our nails and their own, and that often means we get it all over our fingers and toes. It comes off quickly and cleanly. I love that it&#x27;s non-toxic and does not require use of nail polish remover. When not peeled off by the wearer, the polish is pretty good about staying on for a few days, depending on the child&#x27;s activity level, time spent in water, etc. A few of the colors were dried up when the package arrived, but Amazon replaced them. I will definitely continue buying this kit when we use up the bottles.</li>
    <li> the two sets of nail painting girl came damaged, ie the content of the paint is dry you can not use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your attention</li>
    <li> This product is not recommendable; half of the bottles were dried out and unusable. Not recommended as a gift!</li>
    <li> They peel off just fine. However the green polish came all dried up.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the time and money to return.</li>
    <li> colors are so nice for young girls - bright! but the polish peels off very quickly after applied. it does dry quickly which is nice. i just seem to be polishing nails every day because it doesn&#x27;t last :(</li>
