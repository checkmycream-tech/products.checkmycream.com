<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I caught a drift of someone wearing this a while back and had to find me a bottle. This was always my favorite perfume when I was younger and feel that it is still perfect for me. Lasts through the day and doesn&#x27;t take much. This size should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I&#x27;ve worn where I actually received compliments from random people. This is definitely one of my favorites. It&#x27;s a very feminine scent and smells lovely.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
    <li> Smells great! I use this when I&#x27;m in the mood to switch it up and go with a more musky scent!</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a friend and decided to order.  It doesn&#x27;t last forever, but it is a sexy, well priced scent.</li>
    <li> Great price and value i wasnt expecting such a big bottle, and the smell is amazing people have complemented me on it. Its just the right amount of strength. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Received on time and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!  Great price......I&#x27;m so happy I was able to buy it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> More than I expected, Came on time! I love Lucky You!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a big fan of this perfume. The only reason I got it is bc my husband really likes it on me.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Everything was wonderful. Received when promised.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves this much more than two other bottles of designer perfume that cost five times as much.</li>
    <li> was a gift for my grandkid</li>
    <li> It was perfect. Just what I needed for the woman I love!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SCENT AS WELL AS MY DAUGHTER DOES.  I BOUGHT IT FOR HER. IT&#x27;S NOT TOO HEAVY ND SMELLS GREAT.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time!&lt;br /&gt;I rarely leave the house without this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love this perfume!!</li>
    <li> The scent seems to wear off in 4 hours.... It was under 20.00 though so whose really complaining 😜</li>
    <li> This perfume was great it was just perfect for me it lasted long enough for me to be out and do what I needed to do and I got lots of compliments on it thank you very much</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and great value.  Packaging was superb.  Large bottle was worth the search!</li>
    <li> Was a requested Christmas Present.  It was a great price and larger size than I could find anywhere else.  The recipient was thrilled.</li>
    <li> As with any cologne or similar you buy online, I recommend you smell it first.  Well, sometimes I roll the dice and go against my own advice.  I saw it was popular with the younger crown, so bought it, without first smelling, a few years ago for my then 18 year old daughter.  She loves it, so I just got another bottle...and her dad loves its reasonable price. A win-win!</li>
    <li> I have a bottle of this, it smells okay, when you first spray it, it smells like hairspray. you have to wait like 30seconds for it to claim down and settle on ur skin then it smells good..it&#x27;s very floral, smells like summer or spring time flower. it&#x27;s not sweet, but if you like floral you&#x27;ll like this</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUME!! So happy I found it on amazon!! This a big bottom of lucky you for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this producted for a good price and nothing beats amazon! They always have everything ready to go and in stock.</li>
    <li> Perfect smell! It&#x27;s also a really nice size bottle. It&#x27;s long lasting. Worth the money</li>
    <li> For the price this is the best smelling perfume.</li>
    <li> for a none expensive perfume this is some smell good stuff I suggest it.</li>
    <li> I know there are a lot of people out there who love sweet scents, and I&#x27;m sure sweet scents smell wonderful on them. I only owned a few perfumes at the time I received this, so I didn&#x27;t know I couldn&#x27;t tolerate &amp;#34;sweets&amp;#34; and had no idea that a spray of perfume could go so wrong. Unfortunately, when I sprayed this on, I got none of the notes supposedly in the fragrance profile. I got nothing identifiable or pleasant at all. My skin instantly showed its contempt for sweet and all I got was a sickening, syrupy, gag-inducing odor that I had to sprint to the sink to scrub off. I made myself try many more times, thinking that surely such a lovely pink liquid had to have a place on my perfume tray. I didn&#x27;t want to waste the big bottle I had, after all...but each time I tried it resulted in a disastrous run to the sink. A friendship between me and this perfume is just never going to happen.</li>
    <li> I used this perfume for years. I love it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Awesome price!</li>
    <li> Originally bought this for myself... but the perfume did not work with my chemistry... and it did not smell good on me. However this perfume has such a good reputation &amp; I&#x27;ve smelt the same thing on other people &amp; it smells great. So I will be giving this gift to someone. It smells great- just not on me!</li>
    <li> A very nice fragrance. Not too sweet or overwhelming and good for any age. Glad I bought this one and the price is very good!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! I love this smell and this price is amazing the bigest bottle I have ever owned and for the price of a small spray.</li>
    <li> The Lucky brand perfume I was well packaged and a great purchased, Shipped at a timely matter great price, and my daughter loves it:)</li>
    <li> My friend introduced me to Lucky You last year summer and suggested that I try it. Well it took me from then till now to try it, since I&#x27;ve been busy trying some other that turned out not so nice! I bought this over the Christmas and I feel LUCKY! I LOVE perfumes and now I LOVE LUCKY!!! The scent is really nice not over powering, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.....and it lasts all day and more. People around me at work says they like it, a few never heard of it before and wants to try it. The price was great and I got it right on time so again LUCKY ME! And OH....The bottle was bigger than I expected....even more LUCKY LOLLOL</li>
    <li> Love love this perfume. What a great price. Will buy again almost out. Thank you so much:)</li>
    <li> Great product, great price. Wonderful sale experience!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son&#x27;s girl friend and she loved it.  It was kind  of a no brainer, though.  It&#x27;s her favorite perfume.  lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lucky You for many years now. It&#x27;s one of my favorites because of the price, and the amount you get for your money vs. Juicy Couture. I would suggest this to anyone who is wanting a quality perfume for cheap.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing!  It is not too strong and I would say it has a soft yet pretty scent. It is really great and very inexpensive.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Favorite and the bottle was bigger then expected! Gonna smell good for days</li>
    <li> Smells so good and clean.</li>
    <li> I will order this one again.  It is a light floral scent.  I do not like the heavy fragrances nor anything that smells like roses.  This is perfect and the price is so reasonable.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great value!!!!! At the store this perfume it 35 dollars for half the size bottle. I have used this perfume for years I tried looking for something new but could not find anything I like this much. I would recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what the wife wanted, and wife seems to love it.. So if she loves it, I love it... enough said</li>
    <li> i honestly thought tis was a great deal since one of my girlfriends wears it and its smelled fantastic the bottle looks authentic  but wen i sprayed nope not even a touch of similarity it honestly smells cheap its fake so beware just dont waste ur money on this or any other fragrances they all might be fake unless u get lucky and get the real thing</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and it was so well received!  The smell is great for the \\&quot;twenty something\\&quot; crowd and it is a lot of scent at a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best perfume on the market!! I have used this perfume for years and I will continue to use it! I highly recommend you do as well!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years. I have trouble with most perfumes, the smell can give me headaches, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s not as overwhelming, but still smells good -- fresh and classic.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume right now. I don&#x27;t like strong musky or floral perfume. This is something I can stand to use everyday.</li>
    <li> Fully satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> just as advertised...love the smell of this perfume,  It is so hard to find but I love it so much</li>
    <li> The best fragrance ever. My GF love it and wears it everyday. Such a smooth aroma. I love it too</li>
    <li> I love this brand the only problem is I have been wearing it for over&lt;br /&gt;a year it is now time for me to find something new but I really really love kind.</li>
    <li> got this for my girl for Christmas, she wears it daily and I love the way she smells with it on. gets plenty of compliments too.</li>
    <li> Lucky you has a very unique name and scent. When wear it anyone that knows its scent will recognize it on you. Very good smelling!!!</li>
    <li> I received this parfume last week, but I&#x27;m not that excited. The fragrance is common, it doesn&#x27;t last and it doesn&#x27;t make an impression.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s very light and airy - not too overpowering. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when wearing it. Be careful because this bottle is glass and will shatter if you drop it. I unfortunately learned this the hard way...haha. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the scent but I wish it lasted a little longer. However, it&#x27;s better than average for everyday wear plus the price is great. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great price for a lucky man!</li>
    <li> Lovely, classy smell!</li>
    <li> The scent wears off within an hour and I have to spray a ton of it just to get it to last. Love the smell though.</li>
    <li> Ordered the perfume because I couldn&#x27;t get the thought of the Lucky Brand Lucky you Fragrance mist off my mind.It just smelled so good! The perfume on the other hand...is so strong and so overwhelming...my first thought when I smelled it out of the package was &amp;#34; this is SO GRANDMA!&amp;#34;I am not sure that I want anyone to smell this one on me during the day.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! It&#x27;s so much cheaper than what I used to buy it for at the mall. I bought 3 from Amazon because the price was so great and it&#x27;s the only perfume I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> great product/pricing</li>
    <li> My wife is fascinated with the perfume, the size is perfect and the price is very comfortable, might not get something as good at an affordable price</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this scent since high school....I won&#x27;t say how many years that is, but whenever I wear it I get a ton of compliments.  Crisp, clean and yummy smell!</li>
    <li> Smell is amazing. But I assume you&#x27;d know that before buying. Good price and decent size. Really love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells so good yess baby rite on time!!!!</li>
    <li> The price was amazing, but I have yet to receive a complement on how good I smell.</li>
    <li> smelled ok at first then it was like water might be a knockoff</li>
    <li> The bottle is cute and typically I love all things Lucky Brand  but this scent was just way off. It has the uncanny odor of a department store, almost like the plastic wrapper that your dry cleaning comes back in. I would not recommend this to anyone. It is not feminine, not unisex. Just awful.</li>
    <li> Product exceeded my expectations and I would recommend this item to all my family and friends! Great quality and awesome customer service.</li>
    <li> correct item came on time</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it has an awesome sent. When I found it on amazon for such a low price I couldn&#x27;t resist. Will deffinitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> It was wonderful,I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box and it was a huge bottle. I love this fragrance and love Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 cus I love the scent, its a clean and fresh smell</li>
    <li> Just as is in the description</li>
    <li> Huge bottle for a little price! Exactly what I expected. Shipped fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend mentioned how she could not find this anymore. So the holidays rolled up and I bought her this bottle and she loves it. The smell is good and not overwhelming like a lot of other perfumes.</li>
    <li> U love this perfume. I ran out long time ago and been waiting to get more!  Every girl should have this in their collection.</li>
    <li> I have worn many different fragrances in the past...from your department store brands to Chanel... but none has gathered the number of compliments, especially from the guys as this bottle of magic.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is, but this stuff is amazing and apparently works well with my body chemistry.  It&#x27;s a great spring and summer fragrance but you need to put it on twice during the day to make it last.  I&#x27;ve decided to make this my signature fragrance and forget about the $60 a bottle stuff.</li>
    <li> I was given Lucky as a gift 4 yrs ago... i&#x27;ve worn nothing since !</li>
    <li> Light pleasant scent that last all day.</li>
    <li> The ups let someone else sign for the first order I did so I had to spend extra money for another one</li>
    <li> Such a teenager scent. I used to wear this when I was 16. My boyfriends loved it but they also wore Liz Claiborne scents... ugh... It was inexpensive and the nicest I could afford at the time. Better to save your money for something better.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, short lived.</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years and receive so many compliments on it. People are shocked when I tell them what it is and that it&#x27;s not an expensive brand.</li>
    <li> This is my fav perfume ever!! I absolutely love the smell!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. This size for this price is amazing! It&#x27;s light, and I get lots and lots of compliments! Amazing buy :))</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and came quickly, wrapped nicely and was everything that&lt;br /&gt;it was suppose to be. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Awesome deal! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle.  It smells heavenly and the bottle is huge.</li>
    <li> When I first smelled this stuff it was at the flea market. What made me buy it was its size, and the lid. Sounds stupid but anyways I smelled it. And omg I loved it. It was a small bottle. The woman said that&#x27;s all she had. So I went home got on amazon knowing they had it. And I ordered it. It Came on time, packaged well. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> my girls and l love this. I will be ordering again for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Love this smell had to get the lotion as well</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a perfume that would be light enough to wear all day and not give me a head ache.  While this isn&#x27;t as citrusy as I had expected it still makes my day.  Initially the scent is strong but quickly wears off to a tolerable strength that stays that way all day.  I can&#x27;t describe what the smell is but it makes me smile.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance!! it&#x27;s just right..that&#x27;s all I can say!!</li>
    <li> This smells amazing. It&#x27;s light and not real potent, unless you use too much lol.</li>
    <li> My signature scent! So happy to be able to buy this online, such a great price! Smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong i love this perfume i have been using it since FOREVER it is light and sexy / flirty and stays on all day long I WILL BE GETTING MORE ! Thanks Amazon!!</li>

    <li> Excellent product!  Very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume but when I got it open and sprayed it I knew right away this was not lucky so mad</li>
    <li> A very heavy floral smell, not something that i could wear everyday but it&#x27;s okay. I kind of regret buying it, i wish that i would have chosen something else.</li>
    <li> I just love my perfume love it love it love it :) ill keep buying more :) it arrived on time</li>
    <li> THIS PURCHASE WAS A GIGT TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER (17) SHE WAS VERY IMPRESSED</li>
    <li> Daughter wanted for Christmas. She loves it fast ship. Thanks</li>
    <li> Fast delivery,item just as described, reputable seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great gift. Good price</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it, and that&#x27;s good enough for me :)</li>
    <li> Amazing price, fast delivery, same beautiful scent!</li>
    <li> gave as gift, positive feedback</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume! Doesnt stay on as long as i&#x27;d please but the scent is very sexy and elegant. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> The person who received it was very pleased with it. This is the second time I bought this item for this person.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and it&#x27;s often hard to find anymore. Sometimes when I get it though ebay or Amazon, it just hasn&#x27;t smelled right. This one has been great!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed to learn that I wasn&#x27;t able to return this product due to product damaged...I have a full bottle of perfume and I can&#x27;t get it out because the sprayer to busted and can&#x27;t be repaired.</li>
    <li> I smelled the body spray version of this at CVS but when I got it in the mail, I can&#x27;t say I was a fan. It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s not the first perfume I reach for. I just use it to maybe spray a shirt or something I don&#x27;t really pay much attention to, but yeah.. Not recommended for anyone in their college years.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Very happy with the product I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Holly C</li>
    <li> I wore this all through high school, so when I put it on now it brings back happy memories.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is floral, yet musky at the same time. The fragrance lasts for hours and I always get compliments on how great it smells.&lt;br /&gt;Smells slightly like pink sugar, mixed with an earthy undertone. And unlike other more expensive perfumes, this one doesn&#x27;t give me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The reason I pick a five is because my wife loves this. I would tell men buy this for your wife she will love it and you will love the way it smells on her.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite scent of mine, very fresh, not  too floraly or fruity or sweet- just a refreshing combination without smelling soapy or sporty either- I get compliments nearly every time I wear it. I consider it a spring/summer fragrance. The price was very affordable and I&#x27;ve been buying this for years.</li>
    <li> I love it smells great</li>
    <li> Good everyday scent. Basic but does the job!</li>
    <li> This is my wifes favorite perfume.  Got it cheaper here than a small bottle at a local department store.  Arrived earlier than estimated.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great!  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. ...reasonable priced...quick delivery</li>
    <li> I always love the smell of lucky you and I always recommend it to my friends..</li>
    <li> Great product 👍 👍 👍 👍</li>
    <li> I have loved this perfume since I was a little girl. I will wear this forever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this perfume at a great price. Should&#x27;ve looked long ago. Shipped fast, box looked old/used but it didn&#x27;t affect the perfume. Received a full 3.4 oz bottle at a great price. A win win!</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume and I have previously spent more time than I care to think about running from store to store at Christmas trying to find it in stock. I have NEVER found it before at this price! With free shipping through Amazon Prime and at this price, I now have the perfect combination! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Brings me back to highschool but my husband loves this scent so I buy it and wear it for him.</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  Not floral or citrusy.</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance!  It is a light scent and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> thank you the bottle was alot bigger than I thought. Merry Christmas</li>
    <li> Super price and perfect for my wife&#x27;s bday!</li>
    <li> I love Lucky brand. Shipped quickly and just as I remembered.</li>
    <li> love the smell it is light and fresh</li>
    <li> I have also loved the smell of Lucky!</li>
    <li> Very clean, professional, daytime perfume. I have been using this perfume for a couple of years and this was a great price for this amount.</li>
    <li> This product is getting hard to find and as my daughter dearly loves the stuff, I come here to lay in her years supply each Christmas. She&#x27;s been a fan for almost 10 years now, which is ancient for many fragrances. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t totally disappear.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and bigger than I expected. Packed great</li>
    <li> i LOVE THAT THE PRODUCT CAME SO FAST! I LOVE THE SMELL!  I WOULD ORDER THIS PRODUCT OVER AND OVER</li>
    <li> Way better deal then retail store big bottle use to buy for my wife could get small bottle for same price at store won&#x27;t do that again and it smells good</li>
    <li> Lucky You is a very light perfume with a pleasing fragrance! It is not overpowering. No one has ever told me that they find this perfume to be offensive or loud.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. I&#x27;ve wore this for years. I love it. I always get compliments on it. I love the price online!</li>
    <li> THIS USE TO BE A FAVORITE OF MINE! I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years and men loved it on me!! HOWEVER! THEY HAVE WATERED IT DOWN!!!!! THIS PERFUME USE TO LAST ALL NIGHT AND ALL MORNING THE NEXT DAY. Now, it works like a body mist and fades super super super super fast. I&#x27;ll stick to my Britany Spears Fantasy since it lasts longer..... I use to love Lucky....but now I&#x27;ll never re-buy this. No wonder the price went down so much....</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  The bottle does not jam and it is thick glass so hard to break.  The scent is very powedery.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I  bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and received it in plenty of time.  She has worn Lucky since she was in high school and at age 29 she still loves it. I still love this scent on her too!! I had a very happy girl Christmas morning!</li>
    <li> I should have known this deal was too good to be true. I still have a small amount left in another bottle that I bought at a legitimate store. They are not alike at all. This one smells awful, and does not last at all (which is actually a good thing in this case considering how bad it smells). Compared to the real stuff, this is DEFINITELY a cheap imposter. Shame on Amazon for selling it as real. Glad this was cheap in the first place, because I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
    <li> Great perfume at a great price.</li>
    <li> Ive been a fan since I was 16 am now 25 my mom use to buy the set from Macys for me now I can just get it online this is your everyday daily wear perfume</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it. It smells wonderful and arrived very fast.</li>
    <li> It is a Christmas gift, so can&#x27;t really leave much of a review. But this is my daughter&#x27;s favorite, so I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> perfect fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast  Very great value for my money</li>
    <li> this bottle was alot bigger than I expected, I kept it for myself and I wear it just about everyday.</li>
    <li> She loves it, It first came in a gift set and she ran out out of it I surprised her when I got her a big 3.4 bottle replacement she has many perfumes but this is one of her favorites. Beautiful subtle fresh fragrance not overpowering but lasts all day. she recommends it</li>
    <li> Rating the seller not the smell, I bought this as a gift for my daughter, it arrived quickly and not broken, personally this perfume smells a little too sweet for me, but my 17yr old loves it.</li>
    <li> Great product and great pricing.  I received the product sooner than I thought I was going too!</li>
    <li> Great purfume! Came in on time, it was what I wanted and it was in good shape</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells on my wife.  The price is amazing compared to going into a store.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> bought this for my sister as a birthday gift. it&#x27;s one of her favorites!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! But stays on just for 3-4 hrs!!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume and i cant believe i found it for this price.  I had to do a stock up.  lol</li>
    <li> Waaaay cheaper then walmart and I was able to get the bigger bottle. I have found my spot to get this and my mens version of this as well.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! Great smooth smell and terrific price. I have been looking for this perfume for years but could never find it in the local stores. Brings back memories for me. Just great!</li>
    <li> My perfume can on time and it was packed so it would not break and it smells really great. Thank you!</li>
    <li> SMELLED OLD AND HAD A STRONG ALCOHOL SCENT - I don&#x27;t remember this smelling at all like this and they would not let me return it!  VERY UPSET!!! WILL NOT BUY THIS BRAND OF PERFUME AGAIN!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for years. Its hard to find,so I always order on Amazon. Its very light and airy and not too perfumey..great summer and spring scent.</li>
    <li> I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  For the $$ this is a great buy.  Smells amazing and have received many compliances.  A Must Have!</li>
    <li> I smelled this youthful fragrance on a co-worker and liked the playfulness and lightness of the scent. It may be a little &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; smelling and not as complex as some of the perfumes I generally wear. Reasonable price, but maybe not my style.</li>
    <li> Lucky You is my FAVORITE perfume.  For $11.99 this product is well work the money!! I&#x27;ll be buying this again very soon!</li>
    <li> She loves her smell good stuff and when she ran out of all the ones she had I turned to amazon. Great price and fast shipping. The inside of packing was well done to protect the item. Cheaper than local department stores and mall. Will definitely use amazon again to replace in the future.</li>
    <li> Love it, got it rite on time.</li>
    <li> The smell is awful an it is not returnable at all that is horrible!</li>
    <li> This smells great! And I get more compliments wearing this perfume, than any other.</li>
    <li> My daughter requested this perfume so I looked on Amazon.com for it. Like almost every thing you had it. She was pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this off and on since high school. At the time, it was trendy and affordable. Now it sits among my D&amp;G and Issey Miyake bottles and, to be honest, I get the most compliments on it! While it is appropriate for a teen or young woman, I think it&#x27;s ageless. It&#x27;s light, fresh, and clean. Perfect for spring and summer, the office, casual, out on the town - anything, really. The price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> love the perfume. great company to order from.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product and I like it. It smells good and the it arrived fast. Anyway, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast! Great deal...love it! Happy to find a reliable, reasonably priced place to buy my perfume. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product brought back memories. I used to wear this perfume as a teen, and because of the light scent, I still recommend it for teenagers. It smells of florals and light fresh scent. Not a scent I&#x27;m used to now, as I&#x27;m more into fruity, citrus scents, but it smells great nonetheless. I get complements whenever I wear it. Great product, shipped in the original box and came brand new. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> smell great, will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Nice scent. It just doesn&#x27;t last. I bought this for every casual wear.</li>
    <li> smell great. for 2 hour</li>
    <li> Amazing price for the size! My favorite perfume EVER!</li>
    <li> I got it for christmas gift for my daughter and she loves lucky.it is hard to find a large bottle of lucky anywhere they all have small bottles and thats it. So I was lucky in finding a large bottle for her.  so I&#x27;m very please</li>
    <li> I love Liz Claiborne generally but did not like this product at all.  I returned it the same day it arrived.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. It smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. Daughter wears it year round. Scent holds without having to reapply. Not an abbrassive scent, but delicately flows in the air.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of my top 3 favorite perfumes, if not the top favorite! I couldn&#x27;t believe it was so cheap and worried I had understood wrong. Instead, I got a huge bottle of Lucky You and couldn&#x27;t have been more happy!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> When it comes to perfume, many bottles are extremely small for the price you pay. Lucky You&#x27;s bottle is HUGE, and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced. I had gone for almost 2 years without buying any perfume, relying on body sprays that never lasted long enough for me. The last time I bought a bottle of Lucky You it lasted ONE year, with VERY frequent use. It&#x27;s a fun, sexy, sweet scent that I can only describe as having hints of citrus, musk, and jasmine (sorry I&#x27;m not good at describing scents lol). My only gripe is that I reallyyyy wish it lasted longer. I can only smell it faintly at the end of the day. I like to be able to smell my perfume without having to sniff my wrist or elbow so that&#x27;s one star off. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m in love with the scent so it&#x27;s  not a huge deal. I probably need to layer the scents (lotion plus perfume) and it will last longer. A little bit goes a long way, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very affordable perfume and smells sooooo good!!</li>
    <li> Loved it big bottle great price wonderful smell</li>
    <li> i really enjoy this product! it smells really floral and pretty. just wish it lasted longer like perfume does but, this is a toilette spray, so there you go.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy it came on time. i would buy this again. No problems at all with this product.</li>
    <li> Really good perfume. It&#x27;s not musky, but it is strong and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Came packaged in bubble wrap.  Even in dead of winter it didn&#x27;t leak or freeze.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! Everything I expected and more! I could not believe how big the bottle was for the price, at my local target it&#x27;s 19.99 for a small bottle! Woo hoo! Jackpot!</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery and better than I expected! They even sent some free samples and a little shower cap: ) very happy!!</li>
    <li> People associate me with this scent. Love it</li>
    <li> This is the best price price love Lucky you</li>
    <li> I love it but it does not last a long time (wears off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using lucky you for a long time and  lasts the Entire day but not this one!!</li>
    <li> Smells so good on me.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PURFUME and GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> The perfect sent for a mature teen young lady my daughter loves it, is great for day wear</li>
    <li> Smells great. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this because it is pleasant smelling without being too sweet or overpowering.  Strong perfumes, either on myself or other people cause my head too stuff up so it&#x27;s hard to find just the right one. A light spritz stays with you all day and doesn&#x27;t fade away.</li>
    <li> Great product, good seller.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife. I enjoy the scent, and the price is far cheaper here than everywhere else that I&#x27;ve seen. The bottle is glass, and large. I&#x27;ve only seen smaller, plastic bottles for twice the price at any store I&#x27;ve been to.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this scent and it costs less to purchase from amazon than the Lucky store. Overall very happy.</li>
