      <li>So i went with the cheap stuff</li>
      <li>but when I do, I want to make sure its done right</li>
      <li>The e.l.f. Mineral Eyeshadow is natural looking and easy to use, I use it for all types of eyeshadows and it works great so its not limited to mineral eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still very new to using/applying makeup, so most tutorials I&#x27;ve come across</li>

      <li>Pretty color for lighter skin tones.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used another eyeshadow primer, so I can&#x27;t compare this to similar products - but I love it.</li>
      <li>but I must say my eye shadows did last longer without creasing and the colors were more vibrant looking.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, sheer color.</li>
      <li>Good for very pale skin.</li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>but I would only use it for travel, since it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
      <li>It works without any irritation and very affordable.</li>
      <li>, I really don&#x27;t have much of an issue eith th eyeshadow coming off.</li>
      <li>For the price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
      <li>This works really well for me.  </li>
      <li>It makes a world of difference in terms of how much evenness and pigment there is in my eyeshadow.  </li>
      <li>iI guess you cant complain much because you don&#x27;t need a lot to get the results you want.</li>
      <li>and i don&#x27;t like it nearly as much.</li>
      <li>To much come off the wand</li>
      <li>This primer keeps your eyeshadow on for a whole day without creasing.</li>
      <li>I will look at other brands for a better product.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m not too upset - they&#x27;re reasonably priced and I love the product so much that I&#x27;ll definitely use the second tube.</li>
      <li>It works decently well.</li>
      <li>so without primer I have to reapply everything about once every two hours if I want it to keep looking decent.</li>
      <li>Can do without this particular product</li>
      <li>My lids are normal, not overly greasy or anything, so, in all honesty, the Esseantial Primer from ELF also keeps my eyeshadows from creasing even after a busy, hot day.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is worth the buy if your starting out like me!</li>
      <li>I so often have to buy more expensive skincare and makeup products because they&#x27;re made with cheap fillers that break me out.</li>
      <li>others have reported, and I have a very sensitive nose.  </li>
      <li>Turns out they are exactly the same thing.  </li>
      <li>Normally I have trouble with eyeliner and eye shadow not wanting to go on smoothly and evenly, with this primer</li>
      <li>The consistency of the cream was just right , and it lasted long !</li>
      <li>have really hooded eyelids because I&#x27;m 1/4 Asian and</li>
      <li>It makes my eye makeup look professional, and keeps the powder in place.  </li>
      <li>My skin is particularly reactive and I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts or redness after a week of daily use.</li>
      <li>This one and the new tube form of this one is the only eye shadow primer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have been using it over all with all my eyeshadows so far no creasing and lon lasting results.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
      <li>since this is $3 on the ELF website and the other one is just $1, I think I&#x27;ll go for the cheaper one in future, just because they do the exact same thing for me.</li>
      <li>I typically don&#x27;t wear eyeshadow because I&#x27;m embarrassed by how much it smudges, so I decided to give primer a shot.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing primer. Easy to apply, sheer color. Good for very pale skin. Keeps eye shadow in place but comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
    <li> I always used primer potion. but it&#x27;s kind of expensive. So I decided to try this out. It works great. but I would only use it for travel, since it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
    <li> This one is not for me.  Something in it irritated my eyes.  I used on several occasions and had the same irritation.</li>
    <li> Looks great, works great. Nothing more to say</li>
    <li> This primer keeps your eyeshadow on for a whole day without creasing. My lids are normal, not overly greasy or anything, so, in all honesty, the Esseantial Primer from ELF also keeps my eyeshadows from creasing even after a busy, hot day. The difference that I did notice between the two (besides the price) is that the mineral primer seems to stick to the eyeshadow more. I like it, but, to be honest, since this is $3 on the ELF website and the other one is just $1, I think I&#x27;ll go for the cheaper one in future, just because they do the exact same thing for me. It may be different if you have oily lids.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make colors of eyeshadow pop as much as I&#x27;d hoped, but not too bad for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shadow primer and even helps keep eyeliner in place. My skin is particularly reactive and I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts or redness after a week of daily use. I so often have to buy more expensive skincare and makeup products because they&#x27;re made with cheap fillers that break me out. If I randomly break out in a few days I&#x27;ll update this review, but it&#x27;s usually pretty instant.</li>
    <li> this works just as well as the expensve primers.i&#x27;ve used urban decay,mac, and too-faced and i swear this works better than all of those..especially the too faced one. that one was the worst eye shadow primer ever</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a little too oily and it does not last all day.  It will do the trick for about 1/2 a day.</li>
    <li> This one and the new tube form of this one is the only eye shadow primer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, I cant complain about it at all!&lt;br /&gt;This is worth the buy if your starting out like me!</li>
    <li> The e.l.f. Mineral Eyeshadow is natural looking and easy to use, I use it for all types of eyeshadows and it works great so its not limited to mineral eyeshadow. Great price, ships quickly - highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This works really well for me.  It makes my eye makeup look professional, and keeps the powder in place.  It makes a world of difference in terms of how much evenness and pigment there is in my eyeshadow.  I don&#x27;t notice any bad smells others have reported, and I have a very sensitive nose.  My only caveat is that a little goes a long way, so I just daub a little on each lid and smooth with a finger</li>
    <li> Great quality product and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> just what i needed. its smooth and feels nice.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the applicator but this did make my eye makeup last better. I just use my finger.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price. It goes on easier than some of the pricier brands. Pretty color for lighter skin tones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used another eyeshadow primer, so I can&#x27;t compare this to similar products - but I love it. I wear quite a lot of eye makeup and I have slightly hooded eyes, so without primer I have to reapply everything about once every two hours if I want it to keep looking decent. Who has time for that? I tried this primer out and had perfect eyes for 10 hours. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing in the tube. Absolutely nothing. Basically paid for a tube in a box.</li>
    <li> I received this product right on time. The product itself work and it keeps my eye shadow radiant and long-wearing. My only downside is that its such a small tube and has very little product but iI guess you cant complain much because you don&#x27;t need a lot to get the results you want. I would still recommend this product (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still very new to using/applying makeup, so most tutorials I&#x27;ve come across say to use an eye primer.  (Target $1, color: SHEER)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference! Normally I have trouble with eyeliner and eye shadow not wanting to go on smoothly and evenly, with this primer it goes on a lot nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it only 4 stars because I have not tried any other brands yet!  I would recommend this product to others :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t dislike the product. It works decently well. It is not the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; out there in my opinion, but it does it&#x27;s job for a good price. It doesn&#x27;t come with a lot, but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot per application. Over-all I like this product, I might still shop around a bit. Maybe I will find I like this better than others I try in the future, who knows?.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing it on a recommended list in a magazine. I&#x27;ve really been pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> I really love this product, its the perfect shade for me and now my eye makeup stays flawless from when I apply it to when I remove it. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Met my expectations. This works well with elf eye shadow. Wore the combo to work for the first today and got a ton of compliments.</li>
    <li> The man thing I like about this primer is the price. I got it at target for $1. I don&#x27;t like the brush cause it&#x27;s rough. The primer works well. I prefer Loreal decrease eye primer since it feels velvety smooth. It&#x27;s a good primer if you want something thats cheap.</li>
    <li> This stuff works just great. I am no &amp;#34;perfectionist&amp;#34; in makeup nor do I know all about foundations. Im the kind of mascara, eyeliner, and if i&#x27;M feeling a little crazy, some eyeshadow. my friend who is highly involved in her makeup complained to me that I need some primer so my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t smear. I envy her makeup every day because it looks so good always. So i went with the cheap stuff and it does its job. i wear it 12 hours and no smears! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The primer does not make your eye shadow last all day, but it does seem to last a little longer.  I will look at other brands for a better product.</li>
    <li> AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;really works&lt;br /&gt;cheap&lt;br /&gt;good amount in bottle&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;none&lt;br /&gt;I have really hooded eyelids because I&#x27;m 1/4 Asian and my eye shadow always creased and looked ugly. used this and problem solved. also have the nyx white base and i don&#x27;t like it nearly as much.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use it with my daily routine and its GREAT because i no longer have a crease on my eyelids. Definitely buy!</li>
    <li> I love this- is matte and it stays put. It&#x27;s also better for you than the majority of these types of cosmetics. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I was hesitant because the brand isn&#x27;t my usual go to for makeup products but I must say my eye shadows did last longer without creasing and the colors were more vibrant looking. I don&#x27;t were makeup everyday but when I do, I want to make sure its done right</li>
    <li> Loved the product. Not expensive give u what u have asked for. The best product by far. Thank u very much.</li>
    <li> Great applicator, smell, pric and color blends easily and makes your make up last longer. I have been using it over all with all my eyeshadows so far no creasing and lon lasting results.</li>
    <li> I had no idea what eyeshadow primer was until a friend recommended it.  I typically don&#x27;t wear eyeshadow because I&#x27;m embarrassed by how much it smudges, so I decided to give primer a shot.  This e.l.f. product works wonderfully!  I have used it a few times in the morning and my eyes still look perfect by evening.  I can&#x27;t wait to try out smokey eyes and other tricks that I&#x27;ve always avoided.  The one thing that frustrated me was that when I was searching for a primer to order, there was another product called &amp;#34;e.l.f. Mineral Eyeshadow Primer elf.&amp;#34;  I couldn&#x27;t tell what the difference between the two was, if any (I thought one might be for different skin tones), so I went ahead and ordered both just in case.  Turns out they are exactly the same thing.  But I&#x27;m not too upset - they&#x27;re reasonably priced and I love the product so much that I&#x27;ll definitely use the second tube.</li>
    <li> The consistency of the cream was just right , and it lasted long ! Used it for concealer when I ran out of my regular product, as well as for my eyelids/brow defining .</li>
    <li> Great product! Works like a charm. My eye make-up actually stays in place all day now!</li>
    <li> I was hoping I could take the wand and apply it like eyeshadow.  Not the case.  To much come off the wand and you have to end up using your fingers to smear it around on your lid.  Mess and extra time.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I don&#x27;t think you need 30$ brand named primer when this stuff works just fine. My eye shadow stays on all day long and this is cheaper than most. :)</li>
    <li> For the price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work so well with me since I use mineral powder eyeshadow, I really don&#x27;t have much of an issue eith th eyeshadow coming off. Gave it to an Asian friend and she loves it. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Did not notice a difference. Can do without this particular product</li>
    <li> As described. Works well even on crepe skin.</li>
    <li> Love it, works great! The best part is, you&#x27;re not paying far out the A** for some hoity-toity product. Works just as well too! I use it everyday and won&#x27;t apply eye shadow without it.</li>
    <li> It is really useful. I have never buy it before, but the price was very attractive for me. It can make the place where the eye shadow is really dry. I think I will buy it again</li>
    <li> It works without any irritation and very affordable. I wonder how long will it last though.</li>
    <li> i have never used primer before.. not much of a girly girl well i got this got tired of my eye shadow wearing off when i do wear it.. this stuff WORKS!! my make up stayed all day and night!!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. I like how it is cream colored so it adds more potancy to my eye shadow.</li>
</ol>
