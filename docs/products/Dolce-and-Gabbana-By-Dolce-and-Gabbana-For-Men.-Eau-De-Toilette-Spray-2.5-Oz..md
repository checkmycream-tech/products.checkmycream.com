      <li>The package arrived sooner than expected and was in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>this is the best smelling spray for men , my wife loves it, as well as other women ,that i come in contact with.</li>
      <li>Description of the scent is exactly what is says- a real nice soft, earthy smell.</li>
      <li>and you will enjoy it too.</li>
      <li>I use D&amp;G since it came available to the markert in Europe.  </li>
      <li>It is real.. delivered in its own original box.    </li>
      <li>I did you will be so much happier!!!</li>
      <li>but its been well worth it!</li>
      <li>The seller should specify that this is not the original.</li>
      <li>This is a clean citrus scent.</li>
      <li>The price was right, better than duty free and most of all, it is not an imitation.</li>
      <li>i like light blue way better</li>
      <li>this is worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have always enjoyed after shave and colognes, have pretty good experience with the fragances in general due to business traveling from airport to airports duty free shops.  </li>
      <li>This product is consistently good, its quality has not changed throughout years as it has happened to many other similar products</li>
      <li>It is mature but young and trendy but not cliche.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I buy any fragances throughout internet, in this case Amazon.com    </li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>First off there are two styles of labels</li>
      <li>I would say this is the first time I buy a perfume online that I have never smelled or tried</li>
      <li>I have since gone to Sephora and spent $24 more for this</li>
      <li>Anyone who has ever used the  real version of this cologne before knows that  the smell lasts all day.</li>
      <li>To their credit they have emailed me a free shipping sticker so I can send this back in and get refunded.</li>
      <li>the fact that I was giving it as a gift to someone really did not sit well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve own a few  D&amp;G Pour Homme and this smells nothing like it.</li>
      <li>its for more specific people who like be skeptic and cold in night meetings :)) its super smooth  </li>
      <li>I know most of us chose this product because of its value but its not worth it.</li>
      <li>For me, D &amp; G really shines when its hot outside</li>
      <li>is the one I received) and there is the new style which is always pictured.</li>
      <li>I know we all like to save money but just take the extra 40 or so dollars and get the real thing from the store</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very warm and cold.</li>
      <li>For me, it is a mix of exotic perfumes that with only a little touch, the scent will spread around and last almost two days.    </li>
      <li>but the scent was barely noticeable</li>
      <li>It is not extraordinary but very modern.</li>

    <li> recently purchased this cologne, when it came the package was open and it smells like green shrub. I&#x27;ve own a few  D&amp;G Pour Homme and this smells nothing like it.</li>
    <li> This is the reformulated version made in The U.K. Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the original. I bought it for my son for Christmas. I hope he likes it, because I sure don&#x27;t. The seller should specify that this is not the original.</li>
    <li> I will never order from this site ever again, I thought something was wrong with the packaging with it looking cheaply wrap. It also didn&#x27;t smell the like the samples I tried in the department store. It was not until I save a story on GMA about fakes colognes that I made the connection, they describe to the bar code on the box how to tell if you have purchase fake cologne. I was so pissed and the fact that I was giving it as a gift to someone really did not sit well.  I hope this helps someone and it helps them not order from the vendor, EVER!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I buy any fragances throughout internet, in this case Amazon.com    I use D&amp;G since it came available to the markert in Europe.  For me, it is a mix of exotic perfumes that with only a little touch, the scent will spread around and last almost two days.    I have always enjoyed after shave and colognes, have pretty good experience with the fragances in general due to business traveling from airport to airports duty free shops.  I recommend to try D&amp;G and you will enjoy it too. The price was right, better than duty free and most of all, it is not an imitation. It is real.. delivered in its own original box.    Great Amazon.com, please keep bringing other famous and great products!    Thanks!  Sincerely,    Sy Boari</li>
    <li> This product is consistently good, its quality has not changed throughout years as it has happened to many other similar products</li>
    <li> This is the best aromatic fragrance for men ever. It has been around for 15 years now but it is still great. The mix of the citrus, lavender, and tobacco can be noticed individually but come together in a balanced blend that lasts all day without being over powering. It is mature but young and trendy but not cliche. I wish it was less expensive but compared to everything else out there...you get what you pay for....this is worth the price. Girls stop me almost everyday and ask what I am wearing and I tell them Dolce Gabbana and they respond....\\&quot;oh my God of course!!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is a good scent but not my favorite. reminds me of a manly baby powder . i like light blue way better</li>
    <li> its for more specific people who like be skeptic and cold in night meetings :)) its super smooth  i like its from 1999 years ago..</li>
    <li> Description of the scent is exactly what is says- a real nice soft, earthy smell. I have received a lot of compliments when wearing this cologne.</li>
    <li> I love when I smell this on a man.  He loves it too.  Cant get enough of him!!! Perfect gift.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for  a number of years. I spray it on in the morning and it lasts all day, I receive a lot of compliments on how nice I smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great price because it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost if I had purchased it at a retail store. The package arrived sooner than expected and was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> You want to attract, definitely a must have. Meshes well with anyone&#x27;s body chemistry.</li>
    <li> the item ts good, I recommend the quality of the product I bought and I liked their quality is excellent  lens, its aroma is good.</li>
    <li> Always been a favourite for many years</li>
    <li> I would say this is the first time I buy a perfume online that I have never smelled or tried and I got to say I nailed it. I bought this perfume because I trust Dolce &amp; Gabbana and tried two different fragrance form the company before. it&#x27;s very warm and cold.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item through Amazon from Beauty Encounter! It seemed like a great deal! Boy was I wrong! First off there are two styles of labels there is the one with the sticker(which is the one I received) and there is the new style which is always pictured. I have since gone to Sephora and spent $24 more for this but its been well worth it! The one from the department store lasts all day where as the one I purchased from Beauty Encounter lasts maybe two hours! My Grand Dad always told me if something seems to be to good it is! Well this price is to good and trust me you get what you pay for! I sent an email to Beauty Encounter and never did here back which tells me they know its crap!! Trust me I didnt believe all the reviews on Amazon that \\&quot;Colognes Fake\\&quot; or \\&quot;Dosen&#x27;t Last as Long\\&quot;. You can not return cologne on Amazon but you can in the mall spend the extra few bucks else where and Don&#x27;t make the same $40 mistake I did you will be so much happier!!!</li>
    <li> I know most of us chose this product because of its value but its not worth it. I saw a lot of bad reviews saying its a watered down version and they were not lying. Anyone who has ever used the  real version of this cologne before knows that  the smell lasts all day. I sprayed this on me and within an hour I could not tell I had any on. I kept smelling my shirt but the scent was barely noticeable I have never had an issue with fragrance net before but this situation here has made me re think shopping with them again. To their credit they have emailed me a free shipping sticker so I can send this back in and get refunded. I know we all like to save money but just take the extra 40 or so dollars and get the real thing from the store</li>
    <li> For me, D &amp; G really shines when its hot outside and I sweat a little. The scent that is released reminds me of tea leaves. I love this colonge, it will always stay in my core line up.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. This is a clean citrus scent. It is not extraordinary but very modern.</li>
    <li> this is the best smelling spray for men , my wife loves it, as well as other women ,that i come in contact with.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product at a great price.</li>
