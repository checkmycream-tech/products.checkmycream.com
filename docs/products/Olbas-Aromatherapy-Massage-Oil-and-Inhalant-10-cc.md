<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived on time.  There are many ways to use this product; it is excellent!</li>
    <li> Best product out there for congestion. Also works well on bruises and sore muscles!</li>
    <li> Just wish it came in larger bottles.</li>
    <li> Love,  did  you no you  can&lt;br /&gt; repel  flys with this  wow works great,  I  had my humidifier  outside  cleaning  it refilled  it and to my surprise  the flys left , and i was using it just in humidifier  only,  wish i had figured  this out yrs ago,</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I went from a horrible night sleep to an amazing night of sleep just by adding a few drops to our humidifier.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD UNTIL THE EDGES OPEN AND LEAK THE GRAY MATERIAL INSIDE.&lt;br /&gt; PLEASE INFORM THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  No problems with packaging.</li>
    <li> This is the best for clearing up congestion.</li>
    <li> Great product for many uses.  We were always disappointed it stopped making the sport massage oil but this is a good substitute.  Great service.  It arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> I have found that Olba&#x27;s massage oil and aromatic inhalant works great for sore and knotted muscles. It gives a strong chill when used as massage oil, but that is from the peppermint that gives pain relief. So, I don&#x27;t recommend using it on too large of an area at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aromatic inhalant, I found it is best to use a large bowl of steaming water at a table, wait for the water to settle and then add 2-3 drops to the surface of the water. Then have your person with the cold lean over the bowl with a towel over their head and breathe deeply. The effects are intense! After only a few minutes the vapors wear off and a few more drops can be added to the still hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smokes Bengay out of the water!</li>
    <li> Olbas is a great homeopathic prpdicy . Off you have a bad cold or you ate having Sinus problems. Put a few drops on a hanky or pillowcase to let the vapors allow you to breathe again !!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff for aches and pains and stuffy noses.  A little goes a long way.  We always keep a bottle on hand, along with the cream and inhaler.</li>
    <li> Great product for muscle soreness and congestion!</li>
    <li> I love olbas oil. We use it for everything.</li>
    <li> I have broken two bottles (so I wish it came in plastic or something) but this stuff is very good. I&#x27;ve been having sinus pressure and mucus stuck in my head. After a week of this and my ear hurting so much from pressure and congestion, I rubbed some on my neck under my ear and it IMMEDIATELY took the pain away. I could hear the mucus shifting. It was the weirdest thing. I could then press my ear (like to dry out water after shower) without any pain. After a few minutes I could also once again breathe through my nose! It was awesome</li>
    <li> Nice aroma. I use it for muscle aches and migraines. For headaches, you can either use it as an aromatherapy tool and smell the vapors, or you can apply to your temples and massage. I do both.</li>
    <li> Always a favorite. Have been using for years.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it in many of my massage sessions:)</li>
    <li> Love it, and it clears my sinus.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and will likely order it again in the future. That being said. The top of the bottle was broken at some point in the shipping process (I believe), and some of the oil had leaked out. I had my old bottle so I just transfered it over. Is there anyway we can possibly package the oil more securely, to prevent this happening again??</li>
    <li> Strong aroma, great for when having a cold! It openes up your airways!</li>
    <li> I am addicted to Olbas Oil!  I first discovered it when I had sinusitis over a year ago.  Even though I used a Neti Pot religiously, I could not get relief...UNTIL I USED OLBAS!  My students at school have even commented on how refreshing it smells when I apply it tp get through the school day.  I use the inhalers, salve and mostly this oil to survive my bouts of sinusitis and muscle aches.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! From allergies to nasal &amp; chest congestion! Even sore muscles! Highly recommended. Breath deeply, feel better!</li>
    <li> I came across this product while trying to find relief for my son, age 2, who had 4-5 nights straight of coughing every 10 mins, waking him up, due to bronchitis.  I ordered the product and it worked wonders.  The first night I used it, he coughed once.  During his naps, he was quiet and was able to sleep 3-4 hours.  He has not woken up coughing since using it.  This truly is a miracle product and I am recommending this for ANYONE of ANY AGE for colds, sinus issues, and of course bronchitis.  Thank you to the makers!</li>
    <li> Have used it for years, great results.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> This is a great product that works well for sore muscles.  One bottle seems to last forever.  I also use it to help relieve stuffy nasal passages during allergy or cold season.  Very happy with the quality of the Olbas Oil.</li>
    <li> I have a bottle in my medicine cabinet, car and purse.  And oh, both floors of the house!  Aches, pains... and colds !!  headaches too!</li>
    <li> I use it in the humidifier or a few drops on a tissue stuffed into a pillow to help my little boys&#x27; noses at night. Good stuff! I even put it in tea, although that&#x27;s not recommended on the label (not food grade).</li>
    <li> Olbas opens my sinuses and its aroma gives me a lift.</li>
    <li> I had originally purchased some Olbas Oil on the recommendation of a friend at a local Sprouts. However, it isn&#x27;t a product that they generally carry. This oil is amazing for many things. When the kids get a bad cough or even when you have sore muscles and muscle strains. Highly recommended and you only need a drop or two so the bottle lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product when my sister gave me a bottle to use on my neck every night so I could sleep better.  It&#x27;s a wonderful oil and I have since purchased more for myself.  My husband uses it as well and we love what a great night&#x27;s sleep we get because of it :)</li>
    <li> excellent product. i bought this for a friend who hasn&#x27;t heard of it till now. my friend is now a huge fan as she suffers from allergies. definately recommended.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great for my Aromatherapy.  I find it to be very therapeutic, especially when mixed with Lemon Grass.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it has helped muscle pain, migraines, and allergies that the doctors found difficult to treat. I frequently add it to my cannabis salves or apply it in concert with them for a better effectiveness. Perfect replacement for Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (many allergic to dmso)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> The first time I used this was 10 years ago in the UK.  The bottle finally ran out and the new bottle clearly has some formula changes.  Didn&#x27;t quite smell the same and was slightly less effective.  Still will work, given time, but takes more applications to get the same results.  Probably changed the recipe, to use cheaper ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have used Olbas Oil for many years. It is wonderful  for sinusitis and headaches as well as having many other uses for athletes and anyone who has sprained a limb.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Olbas Oil . Try it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> i love it, it helps me sleep with minimal  congestion</li>
    <li> Best of the Best! I love this product. I use it every time we have a cold or runny nose. Goes great into humidifier, clears congestion, and helps breath easily. Also awesome results after massaging into sore areas on skin like shoulder, neck, legs, knees, wrists, etc. I use it almost for every thing and every where. I sprinkle several drops on a napkin (or right straight on the pillowcase!) and put it aside on my pillow for the whole night, it helps breathe clearly if I have a runny nose. You can sprinkle it right on your pillowcase for the night, after laundry it doesn&#x27;t leave and smells or residue. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to stay meds-free! Helps better than any other medication or antibiotic!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for at least 10 years and everyone I recommend it to falls in love with it as well. Instantly soothes sinus congestion and truly makes you feel better. This price is unbeatable from local sources and I wanted the largest bottle I could find. You can&#x27;t go wrong with either this product or this seller.</li>
    <li> Best medicine cabinet in a bottle. I take it everywhere I travel. Works for bug bites, cough syrup, analgesic, massage oil, burns, scrapes, etc. We go through about one large bottle a year. Every house should have a bottle of this in their medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Stuffed nose and sore throat from allergies.  I tried the cloth on the pillow trick and the cloth over the nose while reading/watching TV trick.  It simply did not open and sooth like I would hope.  At best my nose would be clear 15 minutes.  The Olbas burned my throat.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I don&#x27;t get sinusitis anymore.  Apply when you barely start not feeling well and either your colds go away or sick time will be shortened.  Works great when inhaled deeply.  Also works wonderfully as massage oil.  It&#x27;s a staple in my house, along with the cough syrup and throat lozenges.</li>
    <li> I use this on my massage clients for breathing issues, as well as in my home for baths  as well as rubbing it on my neck and back for sinus issues as well as relaxation.  This is a great product and all natural as well!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product after reading that Paul McCartney uses it to keep his sinuses and throat clear. It smells great and clears your head. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Cold season? Kids with congestion, having a hard time breathing? Bring on the Olbas Oil! We put a dot on each side of a kids pillow and also on their pajamas. It starts working immediately and they can sleep peacefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All natural - essential oils of peppermint, eucalyptus, cajeput, wintergreen, juniper and clove. All the way from Switzerland!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> More effective &amp; more comfortable than any similar products ever used. It gives immediate relief &amp; doesn&#x27;t need to be rubbed in - merely rubbed on. The aromatic response works well too, although some may find it strong.</li>
    <li> I chose this product as it was highly recommended to me by someone who buys it in England when she goes home to visit. She was quite surprised when she found I had gotten it on the Internet. I like the soothing effect when you rub it on. I rub my forehead with it and any other spots that need a little attention. I also like the aroma as it helps to clear my sinuses.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...I use this in my diffuser at night to improve my asthma and allergy issues, making it difficult to breathe.  I needed my rescue (albuterol) inhaler much more before using this product nightly.  When I am away from home in hotel, I use a tissue with this oil on it slipped into the pillowcase.</li>
    <li> Very effective; i like it.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used. I have been using it for two years mostly as a vapor for breathing when I&#x27;m stuffy. Also used it with my son done he was 1. Way better than Vicks rub. Helps instantly and in now pregnant and can&#x27;t take Meds and this is a life saver.  Also I have had the same bottle for 2 years and it&#x27;s not even half gone.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for use as a professional massage therapist, at home for headaches, sinus issues, and muscle aches. IT IS THE BOMB.  User since 2003.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olbas Oil since 1997 when I took a 2-week escorted tour of the UK and Ireland.  By the 2nd day, almost the entire tour bus was sick with a bad cold.  I asked the bus driver, an awesome Scottish gentleman, if he would stop somewhere so I could get something for my cold.  He pulled over to a store and told me to go inside and ask for Olbas Oil.  The next day, I was feeling much better and it was completely gone by the 3rd day.  Everyone who bought and used the Olbas Oil was better in 2-3 days.  Everyone who didn&#x27;t get it suffered for 10 days.  I&#x27;ve kept Olbas Oil in the house ever since then.  Incredible, all-natural product!!</li>
    <li> I love to use this to clear sinuses and congestion. Just put a drop or two on a piece of tissue paper and put that tissue in your pillow case at night. It helps sooth breathing passages. I have been using this for years. The smell is pleasant and it works! A small bottle will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olba&#x27;s products for many years and have loved them. I do find they aren&#x27;t as potent as they once were. I&#x27;ve used them long enough to know the difference and so have my friends. I will continue using them, but wish they would go back to the original formula.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Helped my sinuses and was shipped to me promptly. I would order this again.</li>
    <li> Our go to favorite for aches and pains. It works for our family for all kinds of topical pain and the aromatic scent helps with congestion. We noticed in also helps with relaxing us so we sleep well.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This is the bomb! My message therapist has me hooked on it. I rub it into sore muscles and use it at night for clear breathing.</li>
    <li> This is very good product. Very good quality of Oil. I always use it when I have colds and sinus.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of camphory, eucalyptus-like scents, this product is great. As a warming rub and soothing inhalant for colds and such, just fantastic. I&#x27;ll be keeping a bottle around forever.</li>
    <li> Great for relieving chest and nasal congestion.</li>
    <li> Great product....helps with sinus congestion...highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it topically to relieve muscle tension, and inhale the aroma to clear sinus congestion.  It has gotten me through the allergy and cold seasons better than any medication.</li>
    <li> Clears up my nose instantly.  Use a q-tip and put a little just inside each nostril.</li>
    <li> This product REALLY relieves pain.  My husband both use it anytime there is a discomfort and it just disappears! We even gave a bottle to his brother to try and he was impressed too!</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I used Olbas oil all the time. As a massage therapist I&#x27;d drop several drops into massage oil to help muscles relax.  But then drifted away from it. I am happy to have found it again. I now use it to apply to my knees when I feel achiness. It does have a strong aroma, (which I love) but only use it when I am not going out.</li>
    <li> A must have in each house.</li>
    <li> I have used Olbas oil for several years now.  I used to get it at my Chiropractor&#x27;s office in a smaller container, but saw it on Amazon for a much better price, so I decided to order it instead.  For some reason the scent does not seem to be anywhere near as strong in the larger bottle.  The usage instructions were identical.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?  I was kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you need to open your nasal passages. This works!&lt;br /&gt;And if you dab a small amount on your temples, it helps with a head ache.</li>
    <li> This stuff just makes you feel good.  a few drops in a vaporizer, or rub some on achy areas, well it just makes you feel fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  easy transaction</li>
    <li> Great oil!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very familiar with this product. I have used it for 10 years or so.  I used to be a Young Living Essential Oils distributor.  They have something similar, called Panaway.  But it smells terrible. Your product smells much better and it works faster also.  This is my second time getting this bottle because I gave away my other one to a friend who was having pain in her hip.  She was going to go to the doctor for a cortisone shot and I told her to cancel her appointment and put the Olbas oil on instead. Great product - many uses.</li>
    <li> This is the best product. I highly recommend this for helping clear my lungs &amp; stop coughing when I&#x27;m sick w/ a cold/bronchial problems!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product for many reasons.  It&#x27;s like a nicer Vick&#x27;s.  A non-greasy light oil.  Did not use as a massage oil.  Used on front of PJ&#x27;s/t-shirt for kids/people/pets with breathing issues. Put few drops in air mister.  Smells lovely and fresh.  On recommendation of sed with little dog recovering from pneumonia on a cotton t-shirt type thing, and I think it helped her sleep more comfortably.</li>
    <li> Very useful for relieving nasal congestion!  Glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> Love the Olbas oil and also the inhaler.  Thanks for having available at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Have been purchasing Olbas for what seems like decades.  Love this product.  This was currently the best price available.  Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product!</li>
    <li> If you workout, or work in your yard or have backache, muscle tension etc. this stuff will change your life!!! My husband and i use it everynight at bedtime due to working out like banchies and I sit all day and have lower back tension--- this is a household staple now!! After you apply breath it in from your hands and it opens sinuses, helping you sleep like a baby!</li>
    <li> The entire family use Olbas.  We used to have to get it on our trips to Germany, but now we order&lt;br /&gt;it from home</li>
    <li> We use Olbas for congestion, runny noses, sore throats, bug bites, sore muscles &amp; coughing.  We always have Olbas in our house!</li>
    <li> I use this for two reasons: first of all, as something to inhale to help clear congested nasal passages. It really clears them out... if you put it in a bowl of hot water and tent a towel over your head, it&#x27;s VERY powerful... don&#x27;t sniff too closely, or it&#x27;s actually too much (that&#x27;s why the 4 stars...). But it definitely works. I also rub it into my feet... it helps with sore, tired tootsies.</li>
    <li> LOVE this oil!! Works GREAT!</li>
    <li> I like it, but it does burn a little when I use it in my nose. It is not as bad as another inhaler mixture I bought, but I think that it isn&#x27;t completely essential oil. I get that burn in my nose only if I inhale something with alcohol in it. Before I bought this or the other inhaler, I bought some cheap peppermint oil from the pharmacy, not realizing that it was a &amp;#34;flavoring agent&#x27; since those words were covered by the price sticker. I found out after using it in an inhaler, that there was alcohol in it and never used it again. The burning was so bad that my eyes teared up and my sinuses swelled shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this stuff, it works okay, but whatever alcohol may be in it must be removed. It is better to use 100% PURE essential oil for aromatherapy than any alcohol-based liquid. These oils are being inhaled through a very delicate area.</li>
