      <li>Nice scent but pricey.  </li>

      <li>When my hubby got me a Caudalie set that contained the hand cream, I was like, whatever, just another hand cream which smells nice and does nothing.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this!!</li>
      <li>Pretty good price too!</li>

      <li>It has a nice, light kind of citrusy fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to a host of chemicals and substances, so I was very pleased to discover that not only is this cream EFFECTIVE, I also am not allergic to it!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice hand cream with a pleasant scent, and absorbs pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell, love the way my hands feel.</li>
      <li>I had a chance to try in the same store and they feel wonderful.</li>
      <li>but my hands are doing much better since I&#x27;ve been using this at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more Caudalie products, (although its quite the splurge).</li>
      <li>I love this hand cream.</li>
      <li>well done Caudalie! :)</li>
      <li>Caudalie has always been one of my favorite skincare brands.</li>
      <li>Lasts longer than most hand creams</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing, it&#x27;s not greasy and it is lightly moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t smell like citrus that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>Got a good report on this hand cream, not thick and greasy, feels light on the skin with a light pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I am all about soft hands and beautiful nails.</li>
      <li>Besides a very nice, light smell, it was absorbed quickly by the skin</li>
      <li>And if you love a crisp clean lemon smell you will really love it!</li>
      <li>although my previous hand moisturizer was aloe vera lotion by triple lanolin and was great!</li>
      <li>I love this hand cream so much for so many reasons.</li>
      <li>It is pricey but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and smoothly.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hands nice, soft, and lightly scented 4 stars</li>
      <li>keeps your hands nice and soft!</li>
      <li>Not greasy, smells amazing, leaves ur hands feeling so soft.</li>
      <li>Also, I really do think it is helping keep my nails in better shape.</li>
      <li>Makes your hands silky smooth and absorbs right in with no greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>It smells citrusy, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hands very soft and smooth while keeping hang nails and cuticle issues at bay!</li>
      <li>More moisturizing than many I&#x27;ve tried, but for the price and inconvenience of having to order it and pay shipping on top of that, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll re-order.  </li>
      <li>More positive reviews to come in the future for sure.</li>
      <li>Turned out, this was an amazing product that totally saved my skin throughout the winter!</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I have found something that works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Not only was it paraban free, but it had a fresh clean scent, and was not greasy, it just melted into my skin!</li>
      <li>Would puchase again if the price was right.</li>
      <li>But she was right.</li>
      <li>Wish it were more emolient upon application - absorbs into skin too fast, however my hands do appear silky and soft in the morning.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to do much cuticle care because of this product!  </li>
      <li>Leaves a funny feel after rubbing it in.</li>
      <li>Love this hand cream with I could buy locally</li>
      <li>I used this religiously over the winter and my hands felt amazing and soft.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m keeping it next to the bed, it&#x27;s not a big deal, but if you were planning to carry this with you, you may want to check the condition of the tube fairly often.</li>
      <li>Some strongly-fragranced hand lotions irritate my hands, but this lotion does not, so I&#x27;m thinking the scent is, indeed, pretty light, even though my sense of smell is currently impaired.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I heard about this on a blog of someone that paints their nails more than me, which can be quite rough on your hands.</li>
      <li>size lasted me for 6 months, and I used it very often.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t notice much of a smell</li>
      <li>It stays strong for a long time.  </li>
      <li>and I did not feel the residue like you feel with most other creams.</li>
      <li>Too bad, a wonderful product totally ruined.</li>
      <li>It makes my hands so soft</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be permanently ditching Philosophy Products, my old go-to, for a brand with integrity...</li>
      <li>which in NYC, is sometimes in early October.  </li>
      <li>It smells very fresh and clean with a faint citrus sent.  </li>
      <li>When used regularly, it helps keep my hands soft.</li>
      <li>It was only 9 degrees out one day last week -- practically unheard of for Georgia -- and it didn&#x27;t get above freezing that whole day;</li>
      <li>I could certainly find another lotion for half the price.</li>
      <li>They were doing pretty poorly and I was having to cut them often, but lately (i.e., since I&#x27;ve been using this cream), I&#x27;ve been able to grow them out a little.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I might purchase again because it leaves your hands moisturized but a little sticky for like 10 seconds (literally, nothing to much though)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! This is a nice product for my hands and nails... I will definetly will buy another one again...</li>
    <li> My favorite hand cream of all time!</li>
    <li> i ordered this because I follow someone on youtube who recommended this. I am all about soft hands and beautiful nails. this stuff isn&#x27;t greasy or leave any residue. it makes my hands super soft and right away I can touch anything with out feeling all nasty. I love this stuff</li>
    <li> This cream is nice, feels like silk when it goes on and the scent is great too. However, it just didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped. Felt like I had to keep reapplying it about every 20 minutes just to keep my hands moisturized.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to a host of chemicals and substances, so I was very pleased to discover that not only is this cream EFFECTIVE, I also am not allergic to it!!  GReat for nails and skin.</li>
    <li> I had never tried any Caudalie products before. But I was eager to find ANY beauty products without parabans in them, and it was a difficult search indeed. I was about to give up and decided to ask the salesclerk at a local bath supply store, and she recommended Caudalie. I was skeptical of the price thinking \\&quot;of course she&#x27;d pick the priciest lotion!\\&quot; But she was right. Not only was it paraban free, but it had a fresh clean scent, and was not greasy, it just melted into my skin! I&#x27;m a nurse so I need hand lotion, but despise that greasy feel. This one lives up to its claim. Can&#x27;t wait to try more Caudalie products, (although its quite the splurge). Next will be their facial moisturizer and cleanser. I had a chance to try in the same store and they feel wonderful. More positive reviews to come in the future for sure. I&#x27;ll be permanently ditching Philosophy Products, my old go-to, for a brand with integrity...Caudalie.</li>
    <li> Seriously amazing hand cream, you will never find anything better. My nails look amazing, my cuticles are flawless and my hands are baby smooth. You will not regret buying this. I have been using it a few times a day for 3 weeks and have used about half the bottle. So for me it will last 6-8 weeks per bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream. It has a nice, light kind of citrusy fragrance. It is not greasy at all and moisturizes my hands for a long time. I have one for my office and one for home. Love, love, love this!!</li>
    <li> Best hand cream I have ever had. Not greasy, smells amazing, leaves ur hands feeling so soft. Just wish the bottle was bigger. A Lil goes a long way, yes but if u use it morning and night like I do, it will only last u a month......</li>
    <li> MissJenFabulous from youtube recommended this product in one of her videos. I love it!!! It smells very fresh and clean with a faint citrus sent.  It is a very subtle smell overall. It makes my hands so soft and I don&#x27;t have to do much cuticle care because of this product!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It keeps my hands very soft and smooth while keeping hang nails and cuticle issues at bay!</li>
    <li> My hands get totally killed once the cold front comes in, which in NYC, is sometimes in early October.  They get so dry that it literally hurts, it feels like my skin is being pulled off. When my hubby got me a Caudalie set that contained the hand cream, I was like, whatever, just another hand cream which smells nice and does nothing. Turned out, this was an amazing product that totally saved my skin throughout the winter! Besides a very nice, light smell, it was absorbed quickly by the skin and I did not feel the residue like you feel with most other creams. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it as one 2.5 oz tube lasted me the entire winter, I was squeezing the last few drops a few weeks after the winter was over. I recommended this product to my friend who lives in the South of France and never heard of the brand, but now, she is also hooked.</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream! Absorbs quickly and smoothly. Nails and cuticles have never looked better!</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing, it&#x27;s not greasy and it is lightly moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Pricey but worth it.  Lasts longer than most hand creams</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! I found a recommendation on a beauty blog and had to order this. It is pricey but it&#x27;s worth it! Put out on before bed...keeps your hands nice and soft! And if you love a crisp clean lemon smell you will really love it!</li>
    <li> Got a good report on this hand cream, not thick and greasy, feels light on the skin with a light pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Very good. Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I keep a tube of this next to my bed and use it before I go to sleep each night. It&#x27;s that time of year when my hands generally look awful, but I think this hand cream has helped keep them in better shape. It was only 9 degrees out one day last week -- practically unheard of for Georgia -- and it didn&#x27;t get above freezing that whole day; normally that would mean cracked and bleeding hands for me but my hands are doing much better since I&#x27;ve been using this at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell (though to be honest, I&#x27;ve had a cold lately so I can&#x27;t smell a lot of things). Some strongly-fragranced hand lotions irritate my hands, but this lotion does not, so I&#x27;m thinking the scent is, indeed, pretty light, even though my sense of smell is currently impaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This absorbs into the skin well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Also, I really do think it is helping keep my nails in better shape. They were doing pretty poorly and I was having to cut them often, but lately (i.e., since I&#x27;ve been using this cream), I&#x27;ve been able to grow them out a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the tube is metallic. I&#x27;ve had lotion tubes like this crack in my purse before. Since I&#x27;m keeping it next to the bed, it&#x27;s not a big deal, but if you were planning to carry this with you, you may want to check the condition of the tube fairly often.</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream with I could buy locally</li>
    <li> This is a very good hand cream! It smells citrusy, and it absorbs quickly. When used regularly, it helps keep my hands soft.</li>
    <li> My hand cream had a strange smell wasn&#x27;t  what I thought. It&#x27;s a but pricy for the size. it didn&#x27;t smell like citrus that&#x27;s for sure. Will I buy it again prob not. Doesn&#x27;t last long on your hands so disappointed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice hand cream with a pleasant scent, and absorbs pretty well.  More moisturizing than many I&#x27;ve tried, but for the price and inconvenience of having to order it and pay shipping on top of that, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll re-order.  Also the tube is that squishy metal stuff which I personally don&#x27;t like to carry in my work bag, which I was hoping to do.  So it sits by the kitchen sink instead.</li>
    <li> Nice scent but pricey.  Wish it were more emolient upon application - absorbs into skin too fast, however my hands do appear silky and soft in the morning.  Would puchase again if the price was right.</li>
    <li> Love it, great for your hands and feet!  Makes your hands silky smooth and absorbs right in with no greasy feeling.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I heard about this on a blog of someone that paints their nails more than me, which can be quite rough on your hands. Since I&#x27;ve started using this my hands have gradually become softer, smoother, and healthier. Plus it smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream so much for so many reasons. It smells amazing, isn&#x27;t greasy, dries quickley and moisturizes well. It is also completely worth it to buy this hand cream on Amazon -- it is sold at Sephora but only in very small tubes and for an exorbinant price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This size lasted me for 6 months, and I used it very often. You don&#x27;t need a lot to get the moisture you need. Would and will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Caudalie has always been one of my favorite skincare brands. To combat the cold winters here in Utah I decided to pick this up and see how well it performed. I am amazed!!! It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling but moisturizes my hands and cuticles better than anything ever has! Definitely will repurchase over and over! Job well done Caudalie! :)</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered the hand and nail cream and that says it all.</li>
    <li> have been using Caudalie hand cream for years now and love the orange scent, It is great and would recommend to all</li>
    <li> this is the only hand cream I am planning to buy from now on. Love the smell, love the way my hands feel. Pretty good price too!</li>
    <li> After using Caudalie hand and nail cream for years, I cannot even put it on.  Caudalie added a strong, cloying, terrible scent to it.  It stays strong for a long time.  When I called customer service, the person I talked with didn&#x27;t seem to care.  Too bad, a wonderful product totally ruined.</li>
    <li> This is really good for your hands. I will order again when I need it. This is the softest cream I have ever  had. Everyone should use his cream on their hands.</li>
    <li> I used this religiously over the winter and my hands felt amazing and soft. I am glad I have found something that works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as wonderful as a certain Youtube person professed. Very nice sent, somewhat citrus. Leaves a funny feel after rubbing it in. I&#x27;ve averted this by applying at night. I could certainly find another lotion for half the price.</li>
    <li> hmm i thought it would be a bit different but i&#x27;m happy with it. the best part is that sephora has it for 15 dollars and i got it here for $11 so thats a plus!! although my previous hand moisturizer was aloe vera lotion by triple lanolin and was great! it  was even a fraction of the price. I might purchase again because it leaves your hands moisturized but a little sticky for like 10 seconds (literally, nothing to much though) but like it ! It leaves my hands nice, soft, and lightly scented 4 stars it is because its just too pricy for its performance.</li>
