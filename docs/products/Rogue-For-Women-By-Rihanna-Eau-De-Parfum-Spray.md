      <li>RIHANNA NAVY :)</li>
      <li>and she fell in love with the scent</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance...</li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>and she fell in LOVE with it.</li>
      <li>Love the Rhianna perfume, bought it for my daughter</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>The sample smells better.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>This is an amazing fragrance, sweet but not overly..plummy.</li>
      <li>But other then that everything was perfect!!</li>
      <li>so beautiful and last all day !</li>
      <li>but I still love Rihanna&#x27;s first scent more...</li>
      <li>Fell in love at first smell had 3 bottles ever since &amp; a must have for your purse.get lots of compliments!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge Rihanna fan</li>
      <li>huge bottle for the cost.</li>
      <li>The scent is light with a muskyness.</li>
      <li>I really got a steal deal smells good and the price was right.</li>
      <li>and you get a ton for the money, it is a unique scent</li>
      <li>here is more mature/sophisticated but young and sexy.</li>
      <li>This is actually something fairly pleasant and feminine.</li>
      <li>I positive  any woman will love it.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick also.</li>
      <li>its nice... definitely an acquired scent.</li>
      <li>I thought it was much stronger when I had sprayed it on several times in a department stored (and loved it because the scent stayed with me all day).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in a gorgeous bottle, but other than that, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>The scent does not start off as a sweet girlie scent but eventually dies down to a nice sweet plum scent.</li>
      <li>this right  </li>
      <li>It came fast, true to size &amp; all.</li>
      <li>Nice but scent doesn&#x27;t stay long.</li>
      <li>The bottle is really pretty</li>
      <li>but at first I sprayed like I did the sampler and couldn&#x27;t even smell it after I got to work.  </li>
      <li>Loved it, it doesnt stay on you all day unless you spray your self a few times.</li>
      <li>My only problem with this is that the spray doesn&#x27;t spray so good, instead a stream of perfume comes out, but that is minor.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m thinking this is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>Received it fast.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my wife, after checking it out at a fragrance shop in the mall, and this smells NOTHING like the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t really describe the smell..</li>
      <li>so I got it fairly fast.</li>
      <li>I am wondering if this was not the real thing.  </li>
      <li>fast shipped, vey nice but not loud perfume, and  does not still long.</li>
      <li>The first time I actually used this perfume, I&#x27;d just got out of the shower.</li>
      <li>For me the scent is a little to strong</li>
      <li>Thought it would be loud and wild like her</li>
      <li>smells like some old lady vanilla musk stuff.</li>
      <li>My husband is sensitive to ladies perfume, but doesn&#x27;t have a problem with this one.</li>
      <li>Not your average celeb fragrance (sweet and fruity).</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft, sexy,  and subtle.</li>
      <li>I then thought I would spray many times very heavily but the same thing.  </li>
      <li>Very delicate fragance and sexy</li>
      <li>My only negative comment is that it seems to wear off quickly.</li>

    <li> The wifee loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!!! Scent lasts all day and you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
    <li> Got it sooner than expected... It has a really nice smell to it but I still love Rihanna&#x27;s first scent more... can&#x27;t really describe the smell.. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re in the woods surrounded by flowers, trees, grass, and a little rain... Lol</li>
    <li> I love it. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. And this was a bargain.</li>

    <li> Beautiful scent. This is my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue.</li>
    <li> Smelled like an old lady :(</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my daughter for Christmas and she liked it. Also my last name is spelled incorrectly. It is Tobias instead of Tibias. Thank you for the correction of my name.</li>
    <li> I love this on my wife&#x27;s neck.</li>
    <li> Smell greats i love it.i recommed this best ever the bottle is almost done.i love treating myself to pefume always</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and fast shipping, very nice!</li>
    <li> I thought it was much stronger when I had sprayed it on several times in a department stored (and loved it because the scent stayed with me all day). Purchased through Amazon - The bottle I received doesn&#x27;t spray out nicely. It is a small stream! And I noticed the smell seems to be gone alot sooner after applying. Hmmmm?</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance...</li>
    <li> Received it fast. I am very happy with the perfume!</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle. It shipped from Florida so I got it fairly fast. The scent is light with a muskyness. Not your average celeb fragrance (sweet and fruity). this right  here is more mature/sophisticated but young and sexy. I love it</li>
    <li> Very delicate fragance and sexy I recomend the people who looking a petfect give for San Valentine.I positive  any woman will love it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I&#x27;m a huge Rihanna fan so I had to purchase this perfume. For me the scent is a little to strong but when it fades it smells great. I&#x27;m really satisfied with this purchase. I bought the 4.2 oz and it&#x27;s a great deal. My only problem with this is that the spray doesn&#x27;t spray so good, instead a stream of perfume comes out, but that is minor.</li>
    <li> Oooola la!!!  Very nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> Nice but scent doesn&#x27;t stay long. I rubbed the MAGAZINE SAMPLE on my wrist and it stayed all day long.</li>
    <li> huge bottle for the cost. smells wonderful, i would buy this again. i would describe it as spicy and feminine. I receive a lot of compliments. also it has staying power, 2 squirts last all day</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. The sample smells better.</li>
    <li> i didnt order mines from amazon but this perfume smells soooooo good! i agree with the other person who said this isnt for everyday use (of course you can use it whenever you want)but i think this is the perfect perfume for a night out.</li>
    <li> Wow this perfume is a bomb and it&#x27;s less expensive than buying it at sephora or others sellers, so I truly recommend</li>
    <li> its nice... definitely an acquired scent. not good for every day but the packaging is AMAZING. The scent does not start off as a sweet girlie scent but eventually dies down to a nice sweet plum scent.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for my daughter upon her request.  Seems justfine to me.</li>
    <li> SMELL REALLY GOOD AND BOTTLE IS REAL BIG TOO THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This is an amazing fragrance, sweet but not overly..plummy. My husband is sensitive to ladies perfume, but doesn&#x27;t have a problem with this one. My only negative comment is that it seems to wear off quickly.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT RIHANNA NAVY :)</li>
    <li> so beautiful and last all day !</li>
    <li> this smells SO GOOD! and you get a ton for the money, it is a unique scent but it&#x27;s mellow, it&#x27;s laid back it&#x27;s not slapping you in the face or lingering in the room choking everyone for 20 minutes after you leave. I get a ton of compliments on it, &#x27;what is that fragrance&#x27; everyone says! The bottle is really pretty but the scent is so good, I wear it every day and love it!</li>
    <li> WAY bigger than I expected! Definitely exceeded expectations!</li>
    <li> The only reason I ordered this parfum was because I received a small sampler for Christmas and the smell stayed with me all day.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with this bottle but at first I sprayed like I did the sampler and couldn&#x27;t even smell it after I got to work.  I then thought I would spray many times very heavily but the same thing.  I couldn&#x27;t even smell it on me after a few minutes.  I am wondering if this was not the real thing.  As much as I paid for it I would have thought the smell would at least stay on me for an hour.  Don&#x27;t know if I have any recourse through Amazon or not but I&#x27;m thinking this is not the real thing.</li>
    <li> Fell in love at first smell had 3 bottles ever since &amp; a must have for your purse.get lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Just as described! Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the Rhianna perfume, bought it for my daughter and she fell in love with the scent and so did I.</li>
    <li> I really got a steal deal smells good and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Definitely not a scent for the fruity lovers. The first time I actually used this perfume, I&#x27;d just got out of the shower. I spritzed a few pumps onto my skin and was ready to go. I kept smelling body odor. I literally took ANOTHER shower about an hour after. I just couldn&#x27;t figure out what the body odor smell was. It was the perfume. I had never been so disappointed. It&#x27;s in a gorgeous bottle, but other than that, I didn&#x27;t like it. And I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it. Delivery was quick also. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on a description of the scent. Didn&#x27;t like it personally but my mom did, so one less gift I have to buy for Christmas.  Good price, quick delivery. Would use seller again.</li>
    <li> fast shipped, vey nice but not loud perfume, and  does not still long.</li>
