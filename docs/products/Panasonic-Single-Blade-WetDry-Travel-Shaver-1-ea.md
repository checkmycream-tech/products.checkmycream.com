<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Small, convenient, electric shaver that&#x27;s also waterproof. What more could you ask for? It&#x27;s a single screen shaver so it may not give you the closest shave, but in terms of convenience it&#x27;s hard to beat. And in conjunction with its low price, the value is hard to beat. Keep one in your car, your gym bag, or your desk at work. A quick shave will always be at hand.</li>
    <li> Horrible, it won&#x27;t cut a single hair because the holes are too small to allow any hair to get in</li>
    <li> Doesnt really shave that well.</li>
    <li> Does the job, small &amp; compact. Makes two that I have bought for my husband &amp; he doesn&#x27;t want to be without one.</li>
    <li> is very good for the price, and i do the job.&lt;br /&gt;is water proof, but don&#x27;t wast your time cutting long hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my recently departed 31 year old Panasonic Wet-Dry - and my expectations were low.  I was pleasantly surprised when it performs at least as well as my previous on, is easier to hold, and so far is easy on batteries also.  I am very  surprised and pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is a really great razor! Have had it now for about 6 months, and still running on the original batteries (Duracell). Shaves great, easy to keep clean since it&#x27;s wet/dry. Panasonic is such an excellent brand, and this product is very well designed, well made, excellent value. Love it! Bought a second as a gift for my son.</li>
    <li> Used many electric razors in my life, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s compact, but easy to hold, change batteries out is a simple process, the length that the batteries last in this razor is exceptional.  The absolute best part of it all is the easy of cleanup.  It uses hand soap and water and is clean in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I bought 2 of them, one for home and one for travel...</li>
    <li> I returned it - mostly due to it not providing a close shave at all.</li>
    <li> Delivery fast. Product works great.</li>
    <li> My second one.  Good price, good quality, quick ship</li>
    <li> Good quality. Powerful and lite weight. Would be better if it was with a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Got it. Tested it. Liked it. Removed the batteries for storage. Pulled it out 2 months later for a trip. Dead. Tried several sets of new batteries. Dead. Dead. Dead. Hate it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Shaver for motorcycle travel and camping...it&#x27;s small, light weight and works well. I normally use an electric shaver every day anyhow and then run a hand held razor over my face after to get closer, so this Shaver just replaces my larger one when I travel or go camping. Works very well for me and it&#x27;s all it is advertised.</li>
    <li> First time i used, take like half an hour and it only hurt my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t Work, DON&#x27;T  BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i use it most days on my way to work, does as good a job as my more expensive shaver.</li>
    <li> It shaves perfectly and is so inexpensive, you just cant go wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;Decided I&#x27;m buying a 2nd one in case they disappear.</li>
    <li> This piece of garbage doesn&#x27;t even work. Complete and absolute waste of money. DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have been meaning to leave this review for a while now but haven&#x27;t found the time.</li>
    <li> This is my daily shaver.  Note I have very little facial hair so take it for what it&#x27;s worth; it works for me.</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST, AND BOY IS IT GREAT.  I BOUGHT TWO MORE AS GIFTS AFTER TRYING IT.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR.</li>
    <li> This shaver works great and it&#x27;s extremely portable. In fact, it&#x27;s almost small enough to fit right into your pocket.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do, but is quite noisy.</li>
    <li> This does nothing.  I have the Panasonic Curves as well and it actually shaves my legs.  This cuts NOTHING.  Not stubble; not longer hairs; not course or fine hair; nothing.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is very powerful although small. It&#x27;s powerful enough to get the job done quicker. I had been using the mini Braun shaver for the past 20 years but until I changed to this Panasonic ES3831K. I found out I should really have had turned to it a long time ago. Usually, I had to change batteries for my old Braun every month and it slows down very dramatically after the first couple weeks. But this Panasonic shaver just keep going with the same speed for a month and still have no sign to slow down. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as my $150 rotary razor. Much smaller and easier to pack.</li>
    <li> terrible ... do not waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using a $250 Braun shaver which has been a disappointment in every sense of the word. When I saw this extremely economical Panasonic, I thought it can&#x27;t compete, but with all the favorable feedback from other folks, I decided to give it a try. I can not believe such an inexpensive shaver can give such an excellent shave in such a small amount of time, BUT IT DOES. No carrying case, but so what. I recommend highly, but beware, the shave is so close, you might feel a little shaver burn when done. I recommend shaving lightly to minimize the burn and you will be fine.</li>
    <li> Better shave than with the comparable Braun portable, but the wire mesh does not last more than a year - this is my 4th one.</li>
    <li> My husband had a Panasonic travel shaver that he used daily for years...  it finally died, so I ordered this one on Amazon as a replacement for him.  It worked fine initially, but after less than 3 months, it&#x27;s totally dead.  It started cutting out and he would have to bang it to make it go, then it stopped completely.  Changed batteries a few times, but that is obviously not the trouble.  Amazon has referred me to Panasonic, they say it has a 1 year warranty, so we&#x27;ll see what happens.  Disappointed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 5/2011:  Panasonic had no trouble replacing the item.  I sent it back via parcel post, and they sent us a new product.  So far so good.  I&#x27;ll raise my stars to 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 11/2011:  Well, it died again.  Panasonic replaced it, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 3/2012:  The replacement died again, same problem as the last two.  This time it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Unusable unless you want to look like Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. It tears your face apart. No better than those mickey mouse electric shavers sold at 5 and 10 stores.</li>
    <li> Very handy if traveling or all dressed and don&#x27;t want to use shaving cream. It give a clean shave and fairly close.</li>
    <li> Note this review is for the single blade shaver model ES 3831 (without trimmer).  For some reason Amazon has munged the descriptions for this and the other model with trimmer.  Clicking on either brings you to the same reviews.    Provides a fairly close shave, especially if you use it with soap and water.  The waterproofing for the battery compartment is quite good (twist to open), I never found a drop of moisture on the batteries when removing them.  I use NiMH batteries which last over 1 week of normal shaving (about 2-3 minutes per day).  The main downside to this shaver is the lack of a beard trimmer which I&#x27;ve gotten used to with most of the other travel razors I&#x27;ve used.  You can rinse off the head under flowing tap water to clean it, which you should do immediately after each use.  All in all a fairly decent razor for the price.  Best of all the batteries will never die on you away from an electrical outlet.  All you have to do is buy some alkaline AA&#x27;s if you run out of rechargeables.  For this price you can buy a complete razor for less than the price of a single replacement foil.</li>
    <li> the shave quality is ok, i have asian hair, sparse beard with straight thick individual hairs.  the panasonic didn&#x27;t give me a close shave, and cuts me bad if i apply more pressure to get a closer shave.  on the plus side, it gave a closer shave than my old non-travel braun shaver.  also the wet/dry feature and sturdy build make it great for travel.</li>
    <li> just ordered 2 nore...my husband loves the smooth shave he gets</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it almost everyday and I&#x27;m very satisfied.  As a matter of fact, I got so used to it after the last trip that I haven&#x27;t recharged my large Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life as well.  Had it more than 3 months and still running strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer.  When I bought it, I thought it did.  Not the product&#x27;s fault though.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver because it&#x27;s light, no cord, no recharger, just two standard AA batteries. I have a light beard, so one set of batteries lasts almost a year of daily use. I was using an older model with a sideburns trimmer, which this unit does NOT have. This shaver costs less than the replacement blade and foil for the older one; if I decide that I can&#x27;t live without the trimmer, I&#x27;ll just swap the blade and foil.</li>
    <li> I got this item for my husband to keep in his car for the mornings that he either woke up late or forgot to shave, it works great for him and he has sensitive skin. I am so happy I made this purchase :)</li>
    <li> I love these small Panasonic shavers.  Got my first one 17 years ago and used it every weekend and on trips.  Worked beautifully and only gave up the ghost this year.  I&#x27;m hoping the same longevity for this one.  So far it&#x27;s been super!  Cuts very nicely and even better than my more expensive Norelco.  Love the compact design.  I&#x27;m taking it to Europe this summer instead of razor and cream.  The only knock against it is that they didn&#x27;t design a better snap on cover (bigger?) that would accommodate a small mirror ...like the last shaver I had of theirs.  Minor issue.  And the price is terrific!</li>
    <li> Absolutely outperforms the low price.  This thing is easy on batteries and shaves clean and fast.</li>
    <li> Not good for afro americans</li>
    <li> I drive to work and shave, this shaver gives a great close shave and lasts forever on rechargables. I&#x27;ve had rechargables in it for a couple of months now and still going strong and I use it every day, oh and its water proof</li>
    <li> The shaver is a good value for the price.  It shaves close and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  Hopefully it will last a while.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s aggressive and I get razor burn every time I use it, which is when I don&#x27;t have time to shave at home... quick, many shaves for a single set of batteries.  It&#x27;s handy, but to aggressive for my sensitive skin.  Good value though, I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son,gave him the box,he opened it,read the directions,put in brand new, fresh batteries and went into the bathroom.....15 minutes later he re-emerged...looking exactly the same! He says he kept the blade against his week old beard and shaved continuously for the entire 15 mins....it almost looks as if two screens are stuck into the foil head,I believe there is only supposed to be one. Have tried using this on several subsequent occasions and nothing happens...save your money!</li>
    <li> This  little shaver is right here is  awesome! they shave closer then the five-star wahl and pro foil by Andis.what makes the savers great is the fact that you can go  a month if not more without changing/changing  the batteries! You do not have to babysit the charger and hope that you charged to shaver at night !they&#x27;re very durable and they feel heavier than they look. I use them on bald heads, cleaning up the face and going over the loose hairs  on top of the head. At the cost of repairing replacing the big-name shavers you can just buy one of these! I&#x27;ve stocked up on them so far ,I plan on buying a lot of them in case the prices change!  lol&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get this shaver now</li>
    <li> I was a little shocked by the loud noice when I first turned it on. Nonetheless, it works as it is designed.</li>
    <li> The old saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; applies here. I&#x27;ve had this razor for a couple of months. Bought it because I didn&#x27;t want to pack shaving creme and a razor on a long trip to Europe. Put in long-lasting batteries and it was enough to get by. Was it as sharp as a razor? No. Not really even close. But it was good enough on vacation which is all I wanted. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you were going to wear a buttoned-up shirt and necktie, for example, but certainly enough that you would look fresh-shaven.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many shavers. I like mini shavers that use batteries because they simply last longer than rechargeable ones, and when you&#x27;re on the road you really don&#x27;t want to bring a huge charger with you. Having that said, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with the Braun M90 and decided to give this a try. Sadly, it is just not the same. The build quality of the Panasonic is very low-- very plastic and does not inspire confidence. The Braun is so much better built, with built-in cover (so you don&#x27;t lose it) and detacheable brushes. On the Panasonic, the cover and the brush are easily separated!    Overall, you really get what you pay for. At $13, it does what it does. You can move up to a ES3833S but it&#x27;s the same plastic toy. It is not a Braun M90. After I&#x27;m through with this one, I&#x27;m going back to the Braum M90.</li>
    <li> My last travel shaver finally stopped charging, so I bought this as a replacement.  I only use these as a backup in case I forget to shave before I leave the house for work.  The foil area is a bit small, the whole unit vibrates when running, the head doesn&#x27;t rotate like it does on other larger units (I use a Braun self-cleaning unit), and there is no built in compartment to hold the brush.  It also doesn&#x27;t come with a bag or case to hold the parts.  Other than that it seems fine...and it was cheap, so I can only expect so much.  We&#x27;ll see how long the battery life is, and I will update this review in the event that things change.</li>
    <li> Horrible does not cut or clean shave anything. Stay away. Not worth buying it. Going to return it</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES3831 is a great little travel shaver made even better by the addition of a trimmer blade . I used its predecessor for a decade all over the world and( because of the battery power) never had to worry about power or performance . A great item for the suitcase!</li>
    <li> Now I know why I hate electric shavers. I forgot that they burn the skin. This one doesnt shave nearly as close as a generic razor. I dont have to strong of facial hair. My neck burns. I dont know if that supposed to happen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, its well built. Pretty small. Powerful sounding. Doesnt get skin smooth, there still stubble. Im gonna give it to good will</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this razor. good and comfortable shave in the dry and wet. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Panasonic razors. Have found more expensive ones (13000 rpm) to not last as long. Single blade ones like this don&#x27;t shave as close but not bad, especially when used wet with lather. Battery seems to last forever, and love the fact I don&#x27;t have to plug it in for 8 hours. Great price, just large enough to be comfortable to use. Probably should have gotten one with trimmer though.</li>
    <li> Note- The Black model here does not come with a matching case, like the silver one. This was supposed to be a gift for someone and i was poorly misled by the amazon description.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! It works great and i have a tough beard. I used to put off blade shaving for days, but now its actually fun and I shave every day. Easy to use, cleaning is a snap and how can you beat the price for this little baby! Mine did not come with any type of case like I hear some people mentioning but the blade guard is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/10/12:&lt;br /&gt;Okay after 2 yrs the foil now broke and I just found out a replacement foil cost more then the shaver itself.  I guess it can be considered a disposable shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Never the less, I still think its great for the money.</li>
    <li> does not provide a good shave wet or dry and I&#x27;ve tried about every technique or trick out there to get a better shave with this. However it does work good at knocking down the five o&#x27;clock shadow in a pinch but you will still have noticeable stubble.</li>
    <li> This shaver rates ZERO on performance. It simply does not cut! Attractive design but don&#x27;t waste your money. I trashed it after a few shaving attempts and I have a very light beard. Very disappointed with this Panasonic product. Stick with music!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second battery powered shaver from Panasonic.  All I can say is this thing is a great primary or travel razor.  I bought my first for travel.  I am sure I will always have one around until they stop making them.&lt;br /&gt;And at $8 delivered, you cannot go wrong!</li>
    <li> This is my second compact razor. Granted, my first one was pretty terrible, but I really like this one. It&#x27;s pretty darn sexy to look at. Being that I only shave 1-2 a week, I don&#x27;t have much need for those $40+ razors that look like they double as a mini lawnmower. This product gives a nice shave, makes it quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Anticipated that it was to be a replacement for an older Braun travel shaver, but came up short...the cleaning brush has to be stored separately from the shaver because it doesn&#x27;t contain a slot and there is no extended trimmer to trim an odd single hair when necessary.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these for my son a few months ago &amp; he loves it.  I&#x27;ve had to use it in a pinch a couple of times (I mainly use a standard razor &amp; shaving cream) &amp; found it gave a great smooth shave without the razor burn I usually get from electric razors.  I just ordered one for myself today.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES3831K is a great TRAVEL electric shaver. Small, lightweight, battery operated, travel companion.  For those who use an electric shaver, the shave received is more than adequate. This wet/dry electric shaver cleans up in no time and gets 90 minutes on two AA batteries. Good product, good price, good service.</li>
    <li> Even though this is advertised as a travel shaver, I use it as my main shaver for daily shaves.  I was never crazy about rechargable shavers because you can&#x27;t replace the battery when it starts to diminish.  With this shaver, I use rechargable AA batteries.    The motor on this shaver isn&#x27;t very well balanced and has quite a bit of vibration.  I use it in the shower with regular shaving cream and it gets the job done.  Does it compare to the top of the line Panasonics with high-speed, ultra-sonic motors?  No, but I didn&#x27;t expect that.  Unless you&#x27;re looking for slick and sexy, in the end, the result is the same: it removes whiskers!  In my opinion, you can&#x27;t beat it for the money.</li>
    <li> Nothing beats a real razor for a close shave, but the Panasonic ES3831K Single Blade Travel Shaver really comes in handy when I don&#x27;t have time to use a razor, or I feel like a break from steel on my face.  This razor does a good job, and for the cost you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my son several months ago and was very pleased and surprised that is works as well as it does. I would recommend this shaver to anyone. It is really as good as advertised. It&#x27;s easy to clean as well, and works better than those more expensive shavers!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t manage to get this to shave at all. It just pricks my skin and makes me uncomfortable without cropping the hair.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of electric razors. I bought this as a travel razor and one I could leave in the car....and doesn&#x27;t need a charger, works with replaceable batteries   Bottom line is that it works better and quicker than my 100.00+ rotary and was impressed after the first shave</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver now for about 3 weeks. It is as good as any shaver I have had over the past 30 years. Can&#x27;t beat the price.  I have always used foil shavers and it is no different from any others. I use this shaver daily and not as a travel only shaver. My other rechargable Panasonic just crapped out. The batteries would no longer hold a charge. It would cost more than twice the price I paid for the shaver to get the batteries replaced. Just buy a couple of these cheap travel shavers and a seperate battery recharger and some AA rechargable batteries.   One last note. This is the most ergonomically comfortable shaver I have owned.  Good luck and enjoy your shave.  [[ASIN:B001CS8BJ6 Panasonic ES3831K Single Blade Travel Shaver, Black]]</li>
    <li> Its my first Panasonic electric shaver, so far works great. and price is very good as well. One thing about this item is that it didn&#x27;t come with batteries, so I had to go out to get batteries. Which is understandable given the low price.</li>
    <li> does not shave you clean several hair is left on the face</li>
    <li> As my first eletric shaver i´m very happy. Light, works on the shower, with foam. Close sharp cut, nice results.</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money. It shaves some hair  but is completely unable to cleanly shave some, so I end up with patches of hair In some areas.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how little I like this shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using Panasonics at home for years, and they&#x27;re hands-down my favorite. (I have to admit that I haven&#x27;t tried the recently released Braun wet/dry shaver.)  This one so far has not proven to be a terrific performer.  It&#x27;s not remarkably fast, and even with my usual OCD approach to my face, there was stubble pretty quickly.  I haven&#x27;t taken it as my primary shaver on a daily basis, which I suppose would be the ultimate test.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, even a little bit. It can&#x27;t even shave the wispy hair on my arms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for at least a year now.  The quality of the shave is satisfactory.  I love that it&#x27;s battery powered (no need to keep track of the charger) and the batteries last forever.  It&#x27;s well made.  I have a beard, so use it primarily on my neck and cheeks.  It&#x27;s just perfect. I bought one for each of my sons.</li>
    <li> I paied for two but they brought one.&lt;br /&gt;In term of quality, it is good and very useful.</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive razor to keep in the car, this once is the greatest - yes, it really does an excellent job.  And, it arrived quicker than I ever expected.</li>
    <li> For ten bucks what do you expect.  Not as good as a manual shave, but in a pinch it is better than nothing!  I keep it in the console of my car in case I need to shave before work and I am running late.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a travel shaver and it&#x27;s so good, so fast, and shaves so close, I now use it in place of my Norelco corded shaver. What else do you need to know?  In addition, the batteries last forever. I have had mine for five months now and haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet.</li>
    <li> Small enough to fit into shaving kit.  Easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy to use and a darned good shave!! As good if not better than shavers that cost 3 times as much or more!</li>
    <li> Excellent little battery operated shaver!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the price of this fool you, it is awesome! Nice close shave, easy to clean, plenty of power with NiMh batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just hope they keep making this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> A couple clarifications, because these reviews refer to several different model years. As of January 2012, this razor does *not* have a pop-up trimmer. It does not have a full case, but comes with a plastic guard that snaps over the foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those notes aside, this is a really nifty little razor. I&#x27;d expected it to be a little smaller, as it&#x27;s half the size of my normal Braun, but that&#x27;s fine. The shape fits nicely in my hand and is easy to hold. The power switch has a spring detente so it doesn&#x27;t turn itself on in your bag. The battery compartment door has a neat screw-lock mechanism (finger operated) that properly seals the door; I believe them when they say it&#x27;s waterproof. The razor is a little noisy in use, but that&#x27;s to be expected. It does a fine job actually shaving. I have a lot of sideways-growing hair follicles, and foil razors do the best job. This works at least as well as my old Braun, and maybe better, as it&#x27;s nice and new. Shaving takes about the same amount of time as with my full-size, and leaves a nice smooth finish, with no irritation. I miss the pop-up trimmer a little, but it&#x27;s not a concern while travelling. I&#x27;d like a full-body case, but that would add size, and the plastic guard for the foil seems sturdy and snaps on firmly. All in all, a very nice travel razor.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver to replace my Panasonic ES4815 which finally died after 6 years of use, and being dropped numerous times in the shower.  I was so happy with it that I ordered this model to replace it (same 2-AA battery power).  My Amazon.com purchase was shipped and sold by AntOnline.  It has now been more than 30 days since AntOnline sent me shipping information and the tracking number.  I had problems with the service they used to ship my purchase (UPS Mail Inovations).  This UPS service delivers your package to a Post Office, who then is supposed to deliver it to your home.  That would not work for me since I have a PO Box, and no mail box at my physical address.  The tracking number I was given never showed any tracking information.  I was told by AntOnline that I could not submit a claim for 21 days, which I was finally able to do on 8/25.  I was told that UPS Mail Inovations then had 7 days to deliver my package, or claim it was lost.  AntOnline stated that if it was not delivered, that my payment would be refunded.  It has now been several days past when my refund should have been issued, so I contacted AntOnline again today (9/4), and received this as a reply .. We have notified Amazon of your pending refund and they will issue you a refund per their policies.  I have been unable to locate the Amazon refund policies related to items that were never received.  I will give this process an additional 7 days and hope that a credit appears on my credit card.  All that being said .. I will never order anything that is shipped and sold by AntOnline (I notice that Amazon now shows this item is shipped and sold by J&amp;R Music).  If my refund has not been received from Amazon in the next 7 days, I will not be making any additional purchases from them either.</li>
    <li> Its my first shaver of this type. I got it mainly to keep in my car for emergencies. So far it works well. Just dont be too rough with it or you will get a rash on your face.</li>
    <li> I have a $100 panasonic that is not as good as this one.  I now have 2 of these for different location.  This makes a great travel Item.  The batteries last forever.</li>
    <li> a great little razor ,just what i have been looking for ,it&#x27;s quiet .gives a close shave .battery life great .In fact i&#x27;m using the razor as my primary one .My other 4 electric razors are in a drawer . so far I&#x27;m happy .</li>
    <li> This shaver does okay, but I found that I just was not thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another portable raiser that does not work in water, but it has has to rotary heads, And I found that one actually does a more thorough job where patches of beard would not remain or could easily be successfully going back over on the second try. This was not the case for this shaver.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase from Amazon.     This Panasonic Shaver is equal in quality to electric shavers costing considerably more money. It only has one cutting head so it is rather slow going to get a close shave. It can be used both wet or dry. It seems to have some trouble shaving neck hair, but I believe most electric razors have this problem no matter the price. This razor operates using two AA batteries. It has no recharging capability. I use a separate plug-in wall charger to recharge the batteries for it.    I also bought an Emerson rechargable battery operated wet-dry electric razor for about the same price (actually a few dollars cheaper) at one of the big chain drug stores. I wanted to compare the two shavers. Although the recharge capability of the Emerson is nice, there is no comparison with the Panasonic Shaver. It simply does not shave as well and leaves a lot of stubble. The Panasonic Shaver is a far superior performer    For my money, the simple choice is the Panasonic ES3831 Single Blade Travel Shaver.</li>
    <li> My facial hair is really thick. It won&#x27;t fit through the tiny holes in the screen, no matter how hard I try. This will only work if you have thin hair</li>
    <li> Bought it for travel so I have not used it everyday. Seems to run well altho it isn&#x27;t the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Some stray hairs are hard to cut.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not bad for the money as you could easily spend the entire cost of this shaver just on replacement block and foil for others.</li>
    <li> I bought one, and it stopped working. I was using it and it turned off, it won&#x27;t turn on again.</li>
    <li> This is great to have especially for quick fix or for traveling. Light weight and battery operated. No need to wait to charge before using. Pop in 2AA batteries and you&#x27;re ready to go!  This works for my use. I only have a light hair mustache..so I don&#x27;t know about in a person with thick mustache and beard.</li>
    <li> Third AA battery-powered shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and so far the best. Shaves as close as any electric razor. Quality build. Doesn&#x27;t eat batteries. Drawbacks: a bit bulky, and there&#x27;s no clip for storing the cleaning brush on the shaver. I carry it in a small ziploc bag so I don&#x27;t lose the brush.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for surely applies here. It is too bad I cannot give zero for a rating. This thing is an utter waste of money. It is junk. It does not cut facial hair even those that are trim to minute level. I could not even get it to shave at all.</li>
    <li> It is small, light and shaves close. For traveling I didn&#x27;t have to charge it since it uses batteries. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I was laid up in bed for a few days and it could not shave my face. I will probably sacrifice size for a shaver with a trimmer next trip. Use it every day and it works great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I was on an extended trip and needed a portable shaver.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting very much. However, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised after the first time I used it. It gives a very close and smooth shave. When turned on, it operates very quietly.&lt;br /&gt;It says wet/dry, but I&#x27;ve only used it dry so far and it&#x27;s worked great.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this to anyone needing a backup (or even primary) shaver.</li>
    <li> To begin, I never write reviews, even for products that I&#x27;m happy with. Lazy. That said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. I just bought this and used it once dry as a quick test drive. I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before (woman here, slave to the disposable razor). I have stupidly sensitive skin and even with the most careful touch, razors just tear my legs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is amazing. I love that it&#x27;s travel sized, uses AA batteries, and that it actually works. Does take a few passes to get a super smooth shave (equal to a razor), but it&#x27;s still (for me) faster than normal shaving in the shower. No more razor burn from hell! Saving time, money on expensive razors, and water from extra long showers! I&#x27;m going to order a few to keep as backups for when this thing kicks the bucket. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any other shaving apparatus again.</li>
    <li> I love that it uses plain old AA batteries, and that I can take it in the shower with me. I buy one every few years.</li>
    <li> What a great little razor! Great shave and easy to use. Description said batteries last for 90 mins and I wanted to see what that would equate to in shaving days as I planned to use it as my regular shaver, day in and day out. I put 2 Kirkland (Costco) double AA batteries in and......like my title says, here we are at 68 days and counting....and still going strong....and I shave with this baby everyday! Thats gotta be way more than 90 mins I would think.....at any rate I&#x27;m real happy with the battery life as well as the shaver itself....and all for less than $15 delivered to my door!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update for Dec 20, 2011 -&lt;br /&gt;Wow! She&#x27;s still going strong and I&#x27;m getting great shaves everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update for Jan 23, 2012 -&lt;br /&gt;Whew! Here we are at better&#x27;n 4 months (about 125 days) and although the batteries are getting weak, they are still going. I would have already changed them out a week or so ago if I wasn&#x27;t doing this test to take it right up to the point where the razor stops dead while I&#x27;m shaving. That said, I am still getting a great shave everyday but I know that it&#x27;s just a matter of days before the end finally comes. But Wow am I ever happy with the performance of this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update for Jan 31, 2012 -&lt;br /&gt;End of test today.....quit during my shave but what a run. The new batteries really made a difference in razor speed. Probably should have changed them a couple of weeks ago for shaving excelence but wanted to go to the end of the test when they died. But all said and done.....this is a great little razor!!!</li>
    <li> Travel beast!  If you keep your stubile short, it will have no issues mowing the lawn.  But once hairs are out more than that much and they grow to the skin, it won&#x27;t have a way of cutting them.  But build quality is great and POWERful.  There is even an O-Ring in the battery compartment that twists in a secure manner.  Very nice unit in a pinch or for travel or even a daily quick use before heading out.</li>
    <li> My second one in three years.  The first I dropped, it still works but the foil has dents.  You can not buy a better electric shaver for this price.</li>
    <li> My facial hair is clearly too thick for this foil. It cuts nothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this because i hate it when I get to work and realized I missed a spot shaving. I keep this in my desk drawer (it used double  A&#x27;s) for those emergencies. Works perfect. Would also be a good travel razor.</li>
    <li> For travel, you can&#x27;t beat it. I was skeptical when I ordered this, and only did based on the reviews. After using it once, I knew this was a gem. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and I&#x27;ve purchased 5 of them for friends/family. Yes, they&#x27;re perfect gifts! You can&#x27;t go wrong if you want a shaver that does the trick without the bells and whistles of more fancy and costly models. Bada Bing! It&#x27;s a WINNER!</li>
    <li> it shaves well. But the shape and material feels too slippery, not stable in the hand, even more so under the shower. So I wrap rubber bands around it to hold firm. I hope the next version will have some sort of rubber finish around the edges to make it more ergonomic.</li>
    <li> Why one would like a device that is only able to trim very short beard?&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money. Not even worthy to return it. Dumping mine on trash bin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for years, and this has to be the best price yet.  This is Panasonic&#x27;s entry level Wet/Dry shaver with a single cutting head, but I prefer it to the double head of some of the more expensive Panasonic shavers.  It works great with shaving foam, and rivals a disposable double blade shaver.  The Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver line has to be one of the best inventions, making shaving fast, easy, and safe!  I do like the \\&quot;AA\\&quot; models, such as the ES3831, over the rechargeable ones.  The batteries last a long time, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about hunting down an expensive replacement rechargeable battery when they go bad.  Definitely recommended for those with light to medium facial hair.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I love this shaver for travel, but after the head of my uber-expensive Braun Series 7 tore in less than one year, requiring a $40 plus replacement, just for the head, I think I may just purchase four of these fantastic little travel shavers. This shaver gives JUST AS GOOD, OR BETTER, OF A SHAVE as any expensive non-travel shaver I&#x27;ve owned. The ONLY downside of this shaver is that if you have a wildly long ingrown that pops out, it may not cut it (I use my nose hair trimmer in that case). Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer. I can&#x27;t believe this shaver is less than half the price of most replacement cutters or foils. Bizarrely, the replacement foil and cutter for this shaver is more than a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaves very well for a travel razor and cleans up easy under the tap. I remove the head cover and run hot water over the heads after shaving. Not bad. At only $12 each, it is cheaper than purchasing g replacement blades for a more expensive razor.</li>
    <li> Light and easy to use. Battery operated.</li>
    <li> Very good shave, especially considering the price. Will become my travel razor for next couple of years.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would be a cheap, and convenient solution to my shaving woes. I was severely disappointed. The saying: \\&quot;You get what you pay for,\\&quot; certainly applies here. It hardly cuts anything, not even my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am most disappointed in Amazon with this purchase. Being a fairly novice customer of the online retail giant I was unaware that product reviews can be lumped together with similar devices. As it turns out nearly all the positive reviews for the ES3831K on the ES3831K&#x27;s page are actually for other Panasonic shavers. That was something I did not notice until after I bought it. The reviews that are actually for the ES3831K pretty much mirror what I am saying. Crap shaver, doesn&#x27;t cut, seems damn near defective, get something more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I cant give this 0/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, however, Amazon does good business and gave me a refund. I believe the main reason why is because of the misleading review results. I hope they can find some way to clarify that in the near future. Beware, always check to see what the specific review is for, despite what product page it is on.</li>
    <li> I thought this shaver would be great for trips.  The price was right and the size good.  However, the shave was not so great.  Afters spending twice the usual time shaving,  the result was half as good.  I sent it back.  I&#x27;ll take my Norelco on the trip.</li>
    <li> Panasonic has a pretty extensive line of cordless electric shavers, and choosing one can be a little challenging.  I went with the black ES3831K Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Travel Shaver because of its small size and low price, and so far have not been disappointed with its performance.  Powered by two AA batteries, the motor seems quite powerful, and hums along quietly without being annoying.  It is shaped to fit nicely in the hand, and feels quite solid and hefty, not cheap or flimsy.  It is designed to be used wet or dry, but I intend to keep exposure to water to a minimum.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, and this shaver gives a nice close painfree shave, without any nicks or skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch is larger than it needs to be, and sometimes sticks, but that&#x27;s about all there is to complain about.  Pushing a button releases the cover, and exposes the blades, which are easy to clean.  A tiny cleaning brush comes with the shaver, but you may want to use something more substantial, like an old toothbrush.  If you use rechargeable batteries, battery life isn&#x27;t an issue.  The shaver works fine, even with lower powered 1.2 volt, 1600 mAh NiMH batteries.  Although the description says it comes with a case, mine did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade and metal screen (foil) over the blades are made of stainless steel.  For electric shavers, the screen is typically what breaks first, and replacement costs are often substantial.  It is probably a good idea to keep the clear plastic cover that fits over the screen on, whenever the shaver is not in use.  Since it does not use a rechargeable battery, depending on costs, it may be more economical to get a new shaver, versus buying a replacement blade or foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro-Curve works well and is so inexpensive, that I may get another to carry around with me, or leave in the car for a quick touch up.  It would also make a great gift.</li>
    <li> Nothing extravagant but works fine wet or dry. Great size for traveling and I like the AA batteries! No need to worry about recharging!</li>
    <li> This is Panasonic&#x27;s most affordable shaver ever. Saves space, a lot of it, and has a very sharp blade that does not dull easily.</li>
    <li> The first times it really gave a close shave, my legs were smooth. But after the 4th or 5th use...it will not remove hair. in the garbage it went.</li>
    <li> I would just give it one star, but the delivery was prompt, the product was nice and portable so I&#x27;ll give it two. I just wish it had actually been functional! I tried it on my legs (wet and dry) and zero hairs were removed. I tried my armpits, same thing. Then, thinking that maybe my hair is too long and that&#x27;s the problem, I tried it on my forearm. Nothing. I was really hoping this would turn out to be a solution to the razor bumps, cuts, and ingrown hairs that accompany regular razors, but no such luck. Returning it asap.</li>
    <li> This is the second of these I&#x27;ve had.  A great little shaver for a very reasonable price. I use it every day/</li>
    <li> first 2 times i used it with 3-4 days beard and it was ok but i had to keep rolling over and over again, which means it took a lot of time and still missed some stubs.. i had to use my trusted razor again to have a smooth look.. i tried when being wet n dry no better results.. tried a couple more times and finally got back to my Mach3 razor.. i switched to this to save time but it only took more time still not perfect.. may be if used during travel or for people who do daily it might come handy..</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shave close, my beard trimmer works better</li>
    <li> You need to adjust the angle while shaving, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work. I would rather buy those with disk shape razors.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver, it&#x27;s light and compact. It handles easily and cleans easily as well. For a quicker, closer shave, use a pre-shave lotion. I recommend this to anyone who travels or just wants a smaller electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I like this razor because it is versatile, and runs on standard AA batteries (for travelling to places without electrical outlets).  The closeness of its dry shave seems average.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver about six months ago.  I have a thick beard, and I am required to shave daily for the Army.  This shaver is able to handle my morning stubble with ease, and makes a convenient travel shaver for going overseas or to the field.  I believe this shaver was primarily designed for daily upkeep of ones facial hair, as it does a poor job of removing any of my beard that is over a day old.  However, if used as designed, it is an awesome daily shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> Had this shaver for more than 5 years, until the top shielding portion broke. So went on to buy a different one (from aliexpress) just to test out a different type of shaver that is rechargable. Battery on the rechargable runs out very fast. Cutting blade not sharp enough and doesn&#x27;t cut well. Finally can&#x27;t stand it anymore (after just 6 months and bought this shaver again. It&#x27;s waterproof so you can wash it under the tap. Still the best value shaver for me and easy to bring on trips. Quite a lasting fella.</li>
    <li> Great little razor-not for heavy beards but excellent for quick use occasions when it&#x27;s inconvenient to hand shave. For light-moderate beard growth like mine (I am in my 60&#x27;s), it is the perfect alternative!</li>
    <li> One of the BEST and CHEAP electric shavers I have ever had. I was reluctant to buy it after reading some of the reviews, but please disregard what others say and BUY this item. You will not be disappointed !!</li>
    <li> Do not buy.  It burns bad. Total disappointment</li>
    <li> Very nice travel shaver, and it really gives me a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> I do not think as they do not have the product and on top do not have the money</li>
    <li> I normally use one of the braun shavers with the cleaning stand and cartridges.  Bought this for a vacation to reduce my load a little and so I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing or breaking a $100+ shaver in transit.  Granted I&#x27;ve only used this shaver for four days so far but the shave has been just as good as my $100 braun and you can clean this one under the tap.  I&#x27;m actually tempted to pack the braun away to avoid paying $5/month for the cleaning cartridges and just use this little guy.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to use and I still have to shave with a razor after.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well.  It gives a decent shave.  The batteries last up to two weeks, depending on how long an individual takes to shave.  It is light&#x3D;weight, and comfortable to hold.  It comes with a cleaning brush that is very small.  It does not come with a carrying case.</li>
    <li> I get a real good shave,</li>
    <li> Great shave for a ridiculously low price (I paid less than $15). No bells/whistles like hair trimmers or adjustable blades - just a great basic shave. So cheap that I have one at home, one in my car, and one at work.Uses regular AA batteries, so pick up some AmazonBasics rechargeable batteries and you are all set.</li>
    <li> What a great little razor.  I purchased one before, and was so impressed with its performance, that I bought this second one as back up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, I thought it would shave better. I had difficulties shaving some parts.. like when i run over it it wouldn&#x27;t cut a few times. But overall pretty okay</li>
    <li> I have an excellent Panasonic rechargeable at 4 times the price and this shaver rivals the overall quality. Remarkable value.</li>
    <li> Picked up two.  One to replace the one that needed a new blade and foil and then a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic wet/dry rechargeable units (which are more expensive)...don&#x27;t bother pick up this one (or a couple).  They work just as well.  Some have said the neck area is suspect...well I simply get a safety blade and give a simple pass over...done.  By the way, I had the same problem with the more expensive units too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, pick one up give it a try...you&#x27;ll be surprised.  But remember to wet your face and keep it wet (lubricated) or use in shower...it will lessen &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34; irritation.</li>
    <li> Save your money ,this shaver is flat out poor!!! My my my how can a company sell this is beyond me.</li>
    <li> easy for carry, that&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> Great price and superior shaving.  Protect the metal film from damage.  I keep one in my truck. You really don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune for a great shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for getting into some tight spaces between my mustache and soul patch since my regular size, triple-head razor was to big. This razor worked like a charm. In fact, I have also used it to shave in general, especially when I travel. It is exceptionally strong for a battery-operated razor and gives a really good shave.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Close shave. Have to run through the hairs a couple extra times though. But good for the price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Shaver. I have one of the toughest beard! However, for many years, I have been using razors wirh mutiple blades which have been damaging my face! I tried other much more expensive and bigger, however, my beard damages and breaks the foil in a few months! I discovered this nice small cordless shaving machine. It takes longer time than the razor but I got smooth, clean shave without damaging my skin/face. My beard is so tough that the foil eventually breaks/cracks but after one year (I shave every day). So, I buy a new one every year.</li>
    <li> Best Travel Razor i have ever owned. Great feel very hefty and Wet /Dry ! Better that the $ 50/60 units</li>
    <li> I often use electric shavers but, before buying this model, never found a battery operated razor that worked well.  This shaver is small, light weight, but provides an excellent shave while traveling.  I would recommend as a necessity for every mans travel kit.</li>
    <li> Works wet or dry. Gives a decent shave. Can tote it around in your glovebox. Just 2 aa batteries. Easily the best inexpensive shaver around. Buy 2, no seriously they can&#x27;t be beaten for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this product to maintain my high and tight haircut. very close shave to your skin. if I only have known it was 14 bucks I would have only visited  the barber once a month instead of every two weeks. great product. better then my $40- norelco shaver</li>
    <li> This is the best portable shaver I have ever had. It does not miss any bristle and does not scratch the skin. This is battery operated which is more convenient than rechargeable.</li>
    <li> Cheap, and you get what you pay for...only good for a quick touch up, on my exceedingly, most humble opinion</li>
    <li> Great little shaver. I use it every day and travel with it.</li>
    <li> Although this shaver is marketed as a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; shaver, I use this on a daily basis and it&#x27;s been great. Haven&#x27;t had any troubles with it nor have I needed to replace the blade in the past year.</li>
    <li> Portable with clean shave. Better on dry shaving. Blade gets stuck with wet shaving ones it dries up but can be release when you open and close the blade. Long battery life when using once a day.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a quick shave because I travel a lot.  So far so good!!!  It works well, not an insanely close shave but it definitely does the job when you only have a few minutes to shave while driving...</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am a long-time convert to Panasonic wet/dry shavers.&lt;br /&gt; No other electric shaver ever gave as close a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Recent surgery requires no open blades.  Upgrading my current Panasonic wet/dry, led me to include this little gem in my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It is dynamite!  Sorry, it has no trimmer, but it is a demon for chasing down and mowing those elusive sprouts on my neck and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This inexpensive little shaver provides absolutely the closest and comfortable shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 77 I am ordering a spare, just in case Panasonic goes under before I do!</li>
    <li> Razor does a bad job removing hair.</li>
    <li> It seems that having an edger on a portable razor is a dying concept...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that, the Panasonic ES3831K Single Blade Travel Shaver is reliable, works well, runs on a easily available set of AA batteries. Keep at those pesky hairs which may grow long quickly often, and you&#x27;ll be happy with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning... do keep the cap (not attached to the razor). The foil is a bit delicate, so it pays to protect it when your done. At this price, it doesn&#x27;t pay to buy replacement foils. Just buy a new razor !</li>
    <li> great little razor for a trip or quick shave. I have two of them.  I may need to get a new cutter for one of them.</li>
    <li> II have bought several travel shavers looking for the perfect solution. I have two homes and three of these shavers (bought one by mistake when I couldn&#x27;t find one) and a couple of rotaries. Over time by trial and error I have learned they all have their strong and weak points. This one is the best of all, but if the hair on the back of my neck gets a little long, I have a small two headed Norelco that cleans it up easier.</li>
    <li> Ok, so electric shavers still can&#x27;t match a razor with soap, which I still prefer.&lt;br /&gt;My 20year old Norelco finally quit and I hoped it was just needing a new battery replacement, which I did twice before but something else is fried on the little mother board. I didn&#x27;t want to jump into spending a lot on a new shaver, so for a temporary solution I thought I&#x27;d try this little Panasonic es3831. I think the size is nice, not to big or small and it does not make a buzzing noise louder than any other electric shaver. It&#x27;s not really that bad, in fact I can talk over it in a normal tone. It does clean up easy and is powerful enough for a shaver that uses two AA batteries. I have chosen to use rechargeable Nimh batteries but it is warned on the package to use Alkaline only, so be careful. It states that rechargeable may leak but crazy as it sounds I have experienced this with Alkaline too.&lt;br /&gt;  Ok so how well does it do? When changing shaving styles your face need to adjust for 2to4 weeks to get used to a new method. I will have to update in about a month as I just started using it and am only giving a first impression. I did not press real hard, but it did seem to do a better than fair job. It did leave a few patchy areas but maybe after using it a while it will do better. all and all I can say that it may not be the best, it is well worth its price. It is so affordable you can throw it out and get a new one every year. It is not as good as my old Norelco (I doubt the new Norelco&#x27;s are) but it is a good little travel shaver and will be ok for every day use as well.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I prefer soap and razor, but if I miss a day or two my whiskers are to long and I have a heavy beard, so dragging a razor starts to pull and hurts. So If I go to long in between razor shaves I use an electric. This one seems to be fine, maybe next year I&#x27;ll opted for something better, but will see how close it&#x27;s shaving after I use it a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;So I give it a BIG 3 and one half stars for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1st update (1/5/2012)&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver for only the second time, I decided to clean it as per instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I gently rubbed a little hand soap on the foil part of the cap and the foil partly popped out.&lt;br /&gt;I thought no big deal and just gave it a gently push back in with my finger. Well, now there is a&lt;br /&gt;slight crease/dent in the foil. I don&#x27;t know if it will effect shaving performance as it is small and near the outer edge. This foil part costs about $10 to replace, that&#x27;s almost as much as the shaver itself. I hope that it will have little effect on my shaver as this is only the second day I&#x27;ve had it. So beware that, even being as careful as you can when cleaning, it still can be damaged. I am missing my Norelco for it&#x27;s durability, it was very rugged.&lt;br /&gt; I am taking back one half star rating for this. I can only imagine what will happen the first time it slips out of my hand and falls to the floor. perhaps I should put this away in my travel bag and only use it for it handiness and light use it was intended for and get another Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;I will still update again later on, after a few weeks to see how it&#x27;s working so all who are interested in this shaver can compare. I know I really appreciate all of you who give reviews, it helps to decide on an item sometimes, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd update(2/3/2012)&lt;br /&gt; Well I have been shaving with this shaver for a month now and my skin/whiskers are as use to it as their gonna get. As a dry shaver it does a fair job, pretty close shave but I find I have to shave twice as long with it to get the same results as the old triple head I had. I would say that soap/razor took about 4-5min. to lather and shave, old Norelco about 5-6 min. This Panasonic takes about 10-12minutes to get the same quality shave. I have to go over trouble areas many times, but in the end, it does okay as a dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;  Now as a wet shaver it&#x27;s HORRIBLE. I always thought it was the craziest idea touse an electric shaver with lather and that it was just a sales gimmick. I know it&#x27;s been many years since this idea has come out, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. Well it has to be my worst shaving experience ever. I lightly wet/lathered my face and this thing just grabbed and pulled my hair out. It missed over 2/3 of my whiskers and just ripped at the rest. When I was done my neck was all red and even bleeding the little red dots like you would get from pressing hard from a razor, just a horrible shave. I won&#x27;t try it again and my opinion about using electrics to shave wet stands. I rate this shaver a 1star as a wet shaver and a 3-1/2star as a dry. I rate it a 5star for water proof washing, I rinse it out after every use. I must rate a 5star for battery life, because I still have not had to recharge my Nimh batteries. They still feel full power, so if your gonna use Alkaline, you wont go thru to many. I recommend rechargeable, but at your own risk because the manufacturer states only Alkaline.&lt;br /&gt; I still think this is a throw away unit after the blades and foil get dull/warn and it gets only 2stars for that. So my overall is 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt; After the month long workout, I think I&#x27;ll throw this into my travel bag, as I think it&#x27;s well suited for occasional use and will probably last more than a year that way. I think I&#x27;ll be getting a new triple head shaver for every day use.&lt;br /&gt; So in conclusion, if your looking for a full time shaver...keep looking. If you need a travel or light use unit, it&#x27;s okay but for a little more money there are better choices. Good Luck.&lt;br /&gt; (1 year update) It&#x27;s done,the blades will barely cut the lightest stubble. The cost of replacement blade unit is not worth the price, better to buy a new shaver, I have, a cheap norelco triple head. The Norelco is working light years better than this shaver ever did.&lt;br /&gt; I will keep this shaver rating at 3stars, it was cheaper than a years supply of safety razors and cut okay for a while.</li>
    <li> This is BY FAR the best value in electric razors!  It gives a very close shave. The cost of this shaver is less than the replacement blade and screen.  I have had the blades and screens last two years or longer.&lt;br /&gt;And the battery life is much longer than advertised!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor period!</li>
    <li> Dry: This shaver gives a poor shave even after multiple passes and your face will be hot and irritated.  Wet (foam): well, this shaver don&#x27;t give you a shave, just does not work.  Do not waste your money,  IT IS THE WORST RAZOR I HAVE EVER USED</li>
    <li> Yes! Perfect and handy to use. I would like to recommend the item to consumers.</li>
    <li> Excellent, For those you want to shave their head! In or out of the shower, Wet is better than dry.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have facial chin hair that was like a brillo pad to remove, taking a long time...  This razor is a pleasure to use, and I can sit, watch t.v., shave away with this battery powered, hypoallergenic razor; shave dry, and, within 10-11 minutes, chin, jaw line nice and smooth.  Goodbye, razor blades, and I&#x27;m doing the planet a favor.</li>
    <li> Bought this to carry in my car to do quick touch-ups while driving to work. Batteries last a long time.</li>
    <li> The shaver works very well.  Be aware that this one has no trimmer.  It warns not to use rechargeable batteries because they might corrode if left in forever [what battery won&#x27;t?] I use pair of nickel metal hydride AA , and they last a LONG time.</li>
    <li> I bought this and Panasonic ES3830 to replace my broken screen Braun 370 which is no longer made.    Both this shaver and Panasonic ES3830 seem to use the same screen and cutting block. Which is convenient.    This shaver is a bit bigger than the Braun 370 and has no trimmer like the Braun. It cuts well enough, nothing impressive, but not to sure as i&#x60;m not really using it yet on a regular basses.     Good news is this shaver hasn&#x27;t stopped working like the Panasonic ES3830.    The price for both was cheap compared to the replacement Braun models. Think I could have bought 4 Panasonics for the price of one Braun. I don&#x27;t know if the new Brauns cut better but 4 Panasonics probably would have lasted longer.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well, and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the suitcase.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my home shaver, nor is it quite as comfortable, but it is great for trips.</li>
    <li> better than razor if you prefer electric ones over blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;feels nice, easy to handle, but then again it&#x27;s not a rocket, you just turn it on and rub it around your face.&lt;br /&gt;not the closest shave but, you will look presentable enough</li>
    <li> the Panasonic shaver works well when I go to vegas no need to look for ac outlets,and can be used anytime.</li>
    <li> Great size for travel, shaves surprisingly close given the price, and washes easily.  Best to remove batteries while traveling to prevent accidentally switching on in luggage but the sliding switch is hard to push accidentally. The AA batteries are easy to get if they run out while traveling.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and gives a nice shave.  Perfect for lip area if you want a quick touch up.</li>
    <li> The only complaints is it makes a  louder noise than my Philips.</li>
    <li> Great travel razor, but don&#x27;t miss a day of shaving.  This razor will not do well with long whiskers.</li>
    <li> Panasonic ES3831K Single Blade Travel Shaver, Black. This a great little shaver!  i can&#x27;t think of much to say about it that&#x27;s bad except it is missing an edge (or mustache) trimmer.  other than that i put some good stronge batteries in and it has been serving me just fine from day one.  i recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;RB</li>
    <li> I use this shave in the shower and it works great. I have another Panasonic that uses the same foil and blade and I can&#x27;t tell the difference in their shave.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a good deal!! Wow - less than $10 for an electric shaver. Go me!! Well, I tried it today and nothing - nada, zip. Only made my hairs mad - ruffled them up, but no fight! Not one single hair was removed. I used fresh batteries, installed correctly, turned on and nothing. Just a wannabe massage from an electric razor. Bum deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for you!</li>
    <li> Very useful, shaves very close, is very comfortable, batteries last quite a while, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Dead on arrival.  Not best quality.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shaver for a man on a river trip--or any expedition away from 110v. power sources. It runs very fast and is practically impervious to water (if not actual dunking). The fact that it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a two blade shaver is minor.</li>
    <li> Brought this shaver to replace my damaged Braun shaver (same type portable one). I have been using Braun portable shaver for a few years now and already got use to it. By comparison, the Panasonic shaver is heavier and sturdier, especially the top shaving surface has a firm support. I love it and used it almost every day since May (4 months). I use rechargeable batteries and worked very well for me - lasting one to two weeks for a recharge (AA Panasonic rechargeable batteries bought 10 years ago). I highly recommend it and I bought another one for my son after my one week try while price was $7.99!</li>
    <li> Great little electric razor for those of you who shaves daily or every other day.  Wet shave is literally cleaner than a MACH 4 or whatever expensive razor I had.  I don&#x27;t have a full beard or anything to testify for the average American shaving habits.  But this is a perfect razor for your Asian friends if you want to give them a gift.    I guess the one bad thing about this is that there is no compartment to store the cleaning brush... just be prepare to lose that.</li>
    <li> I found the razor to be adequate since I have to flick the on off button two or three times for it to go to full power. I&#x27;m not sure if  this is the particular razor&#x27;s fault or a product flaw since I ordered two razors and only received one. I entered two razors with the buy with one click key and did not notice the order was then divided by the computer program to two separate companies. One charged more  for shipping than the other a lot more for the item. I do blame myself for not paying attention. I have been buying from Amazon for years but this is by far the worst experience I have ever had. I will continue to buy from Amazon but not anymore Panasonic products or from these two companies.</li>
    <li> My brother likes this shaver and says it works well.  The only thing is he wish it came with a case.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband, he loves it. He says it gives him a nice close shave. It is quiet ...not too loud.&lt;br /&gt; Also for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Does a surprisingly good of shaving in a minimum amount of time.  One caution--although the screen/cutting blade are replaceable, the Amazon price for these components are actually greater than it would cost to replace the shaver outright.</li>
    <li> nice item, nice seller</li>
    <li> Good product. As described. Doesn&#x27;t cut longer hair</li>
    <li> I went two days without shaving and found this cordless shaver will not touch a two day old stubble. Switched back to my old double edge Gillette.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT CARE, THE PRODUCT ARRIVED IN TIME SET. I RECOMMEND 100%</li>
    <li> This is a awesome little shaver. It shipped fast and has exceeded my expectations by far! Simple design, good battery life, small size, and waterproof what else could you ask for? The actual shaving with this is great, it might take a few passes to get all the way down but man once it does it leaves my face smoother than disposable razors! Overall I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I think I relied too much on the photo suggesting this razor was smaller than a standard model, which is what I&#x27;d expect for a \\&quot;travel shaver\\&quot;.  It must have been photographed in a giant&#x27;s hand!  It is almost as bulky as a standard sized model.  I&#x27;m have no reason to think it does not perform well, but in this case \\&quot;travel\\&quot; does not translate to \\&quot;compact\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be clear: neither this nor any other electric shaver will come close to what you can do with a modern multiblade razor. However, in a pinch or for travel when it is difficult to take shaving cream, this little guy doesn&#x27;t do a bad job. I find that I need to use it twice a day to even approximate a razor shave but all in all, it is convenient and will clean you up sufficiently to keep you from looking like a homeless person on your next business trip.</li>
    <li> If you have an elderly loved one, male or female, that might be in need of some whisker maintenance, this is a great product. Easy to hold and use even with arthritis. Might require some additional help to get all the hair. Easy to pack away in a purse if your grandparent is like mine and likes to carry all their worldly possessions with them at all times. I like that it is battery operated instead of having a charger as the charger would just be one more thing to lose. Good price.</li>
    <li> THIS SHAVER IS GREAT AS CLOSE AS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE SHAVERS SMALL COMPACT WELL BUILT GREAT CHEAP SHAVE I USE THIS SHAVER AS A EVERYDAY SHAVER</li>
    <li> Great little shaver, this works better than the $50 wahl super close shaver which many barbers use. Although that uses a lithium battery which is supposed to be better, I find double AA&#x27;s work much easier for this mainly cause people have been known to get 80-120 shaves per 2 double AA batteries according to a few reviews, and with the Wahl it can die after only a shave or two at most after many uses. I&#x27;m a barber by profession, and this works much better than expected, for the price it&#x27;s unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, not exactly what I expected though</li>
    <li> Average Shaver.  Average Close Shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is ok...I have a small one that is actually better.  Surprised because I have a larger 110V Panasonic that is a great shaver.</li>
    <li> Why would anyone spend $100 or more for a shaver?</li>
    <li> Works well, especially for the size and price.  Shaves well though not extremely close.  May still need a blade if you want a really close shave.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these for over two years. I use it every morning. It lasts about three weeks on two batteries. Sure, its slow in the third week, but it does a good job. I find it as good as my expensive Braun with all the gizmos. A great every day razor, not just a travel razor.</li>
    <li> This is a no-nonssense wet/dry shaver.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and yet works just as well as other more expensive models.  It&#x27;s a bit bigger than i expected since I was hoping to get a really compact one.  After some use, I don&#x27;t think much about its size because its very ergonomic.  It&#x27;s now my primary shaver at home too.  Since it doesn&#x27;t have a pop-up trimmer, I still need my other shaver from time to time.  Cleaning it is a breeze though the included brush could be a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> The only electric shaver I have ever used that drew blood. I shaved off my goatee tonight and when I was done, I had about 6 tiny bloody spots. I am not sure if that is good or bad. One thing is, it gets the job done of shaving off all the beard.</li>
    <li> I have been using this to shave in the car when I am running late.  It does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;it is not as close as a razor, but I&#x27;ve never had an electric shaver do as well as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the shaver for over a month and first set of batteries is running strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning head has been easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accidently dropped it about three feet once and had no damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;Had this for almost a year now and changed the batteries only once - in the winter when it was really cold.  As the weather has gotten warmer, the batteries have gotten better.  Since I leave this in the car, I realized the car needed to warm up so the batteries warmed up before I started shaving.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for travel and touchups on days I didn&#x27;t won&#x27;t to use a safety razor. So far it has performed well and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. The price was right too. I would recomend it to anyone who wants a good inexpensive battery powered shaver for travel and light use around the house.</li>
    <li> It doesnt even cut the hair? Its not even a paper weight. Its worthless. not even worthy to go in my trash can!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and does the trick.  Rather on the loud side, but no real complaints.</li>
    <li> This sucked horribly and left welps  on my neck. I even used electric razer lotion</li>
    <li> This I like!  Great travel shaver that can be easily cleaned in the shower.  Also great for touch-up.  It will not shave as close as a safety or straight edge but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s supposed to used for.  I will reside peramanently in my travel backpack.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a shaver to keep in my car&#x27;s glove box.  Most of time I shave by razor in morning, so if I want a closer shave in the evening I just bring this out while driving.  Strange thing, I find I get a closer shave on this than my expensive Braun 340s-4, which I purchased to keep with me when travelling.  Now I keep the Panasonic with me when travelling, and  it takes up less space and I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging.  The only thing missing from this shaver is a trimmer for longer hairs; however when traveling I always keep a throw-away razor with me, so I use that to shave long hairs, or if I my beard is long, then I like to first shave with a blade, and typically finish with the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Excellent portable shaver....shaves close as a razor., without the issues with razors, cuts etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl with legs.  I wanted a electric razor to remove hair from same, razor blades always cause tags for some reason.  Anyway, I tried everywhere, this razor does not work to remove hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these for my dad 3 years ago, and he loved it so much it became his everyday shaver.  The old one is still working, but he asked me to order him another new one--in fact 2 new ones just in case they quit making them.  My brother also uses one of these, and he&#x27;s just as big a fan as my dad.</li>
    <li> I use an expensive ($350) Panasonic as my primary shaver, and use this $14 shaver to shave under my nose where the large head of the primary shaver has some problems. Then I run this over the rest of my face and it always manages to find some whiskers the primary shaver missed. (I know this because I can hear it when it cuts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would also be a good choice to keep in your car&#x27;s glove compartment for a quick touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative: it lacks an extendable trimmer for sideburns and moustaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five start are my assessment of value for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad, his eyesight is rather poor so plugging in a shaver was a problem. This shaver is wonderful, batteries life is excellent, clean close shave, fits in his pocket, has a raised slide button to turn on/off. Reorder blades are available but this shaver is so cheap just buy a new one. Would recommend it to anyone that travels, shaves at traffic lights, has a problem like my Dad or just needs a inexpensive shaver that really does a great job for a small price.</li>
    <li> Not very good, doesn&#x27;t seem to cut much, unless im using it wrong</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I needed a trimmer badly though so I got myself a Braun.</li>
    <li> I love this little razor.  Normally, at home I use a Fuzion razor blade, but when traveling, and I want a &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34;, or I&#x27;m in a hurry, I use this shaver.  I&#x27;m buying another one because this one shaves better than my electric shaver which is unreliable and doesn&#x27;t shave as well as this one.  One thing, though, I use this shaver mostly as a travel shaver and it does an excellent job.  It does irritate my face a bit, but I find that all electric shavers irritate my face, and so does the Fusion a little bit, so this is not a problem, and not a reason to downgrade the shaver because I have sensitive skin.  Buy it, use it for a backup, or travel, or for that quick touch-up.  Don&#x27;t try to shave off a big, thick, long beard with it.  It is not made for that.</li>
    <li> The best shaver that I have ever used. I been using a safety razor for 40 years with great irritation. This shaver gives me 95% as good of&lt;br /&gt;shave and no irritation. It took a week to get used to this shaver then nothing but satisfaction. So I bought 2 more, one to leave in the car&lt;br /&gt;and one to leave at my daughter&#x27;s house because we visit often. I am thinking of buying more should one go bad. I believe you would say&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with these shavers.</li>
    <li> Good product, good materials, low price.&lt;br /&gt;But cannot cut long or soft hair(~4-5mm or longer). So, you have to shave more frequently and if your hair grew long you need to shave with something else first.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding razor. I picked it up during the Father&#x27;s day sale for $9. That&#x27;s right, $9 including shipping! Very good purchase and product. I needed a travel razor for my 2 week trip to Brazil recently. This fit the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> This small inexpensive shaver is a super shaver!  It&#x27;s wide head and easy cleaning is a great advantage.  Not only for travel but excellent for home use.</li>
    <li> never had  a closer shave with higher priced razors as I get with this razor, and the Panasonic brand is one of the best!</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes the best electric shaver and this one goes beyond rechargeable! 2 AA batteries last 2 weeks and it will not shred your face like a razor. It shaves as close as a blade, the screen and head last 6 months or more and it does legs and pits, too!</li>
    <li> False advertising. This product is not a shaver . It removes NO hair . Ran it over the area several times and no results. I was very disappointed with this product and returned it.</li>
    <li> I keep it in my car, and use it almost every day.  It does a great job on my chin and upper lip where a blade doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  It is also great to have on hand for later in the day, getting rid of that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  When it runs a little slow in the morning, warming the cold batteries in my hands first will give me a LOT more shaves before new batteries are actually necessary.  This is a great little shaver; just keep the screen guard on (a new screen sometimes costs as much as the shaver!).</li>
    <li> The first few times it worked OK but was not a close shave. After that, the shaver did not seem to do anything. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> It does not work. I bought it and do what instructions say. It is not functional. Don not buy it from here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this little shaver for more than a year now, and it has never let me down. The single blade does an adequate job of removing most whiskers. It&#x27;s not the quickest or the best shave you&#x27;ll ever get, but for what it is it&#x27;s great. I keep one in my car and shave on the way to my destination. This multitasking saves me time if I&#x27;m running late. I use it on a typical day, and shave with a razor one in a while to get what it missed. It&#x27;s a good system for me, as it gives me a balance of performance and flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability of the shaver to use AA batteries means as long as you have or can purchase a few batteries, you are good to go. Personally, I prefer rechargeable AA batteries, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to keep some charging to instantly swap them out when I feel this shaver is running a little slow. This is way better than the drawback of shavers containing built-in batteries. You can&#x27;t remove them when they start declining in performance, and you have to wait for the recharge cycle to do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price, either. It&#x27;s cheaper than buying replacement blades/screens for most shavers, including this one. Yes, you heard me right--you are better off buying a new one of these than the replacement parts for it. Start stocking up on these now. If the company making these goes out of business and this unit stops being produced, the replacement parts may go on sale. At that point, if you purchased a bunch of these units over the years, you could pick up a whole bunch of spare screens/blades on sale and never buy another shaver. That&#x27;s my theory.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this would never allow me to get a reasonably close shave without skin burn issues.  It was a great bargain and I wish it would have worked for me.</li>
    <li> I bought a second one of these,  It was cheaper to buy a new one than replace the blades on the old one.  Shaver works well and gives a reasonable battery life.</li>
    <li> nice shave  - better than other compact electrics I&#x27;ve used.  Nice to use in shower.  Not particularly loud.</li>
    <li> I had been looking at a water proof electric shaver for travel but they were all so expensive.  I found this one for under $20 and could not believe it..  it works great.  Clean up is easy.  Only down side is that it is not rechargable but the AA batteries have allready last me almost 3 weeks.  Great product.....price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I actually have no idea how these work as shavers. But they were selling for $13 apiece with free shipping, and they use the same foil and cutter as the shaver I normally use every day. If I buy the replacement foil / cutter at the cheapest place I can find them, they cost $20. So instead I bought a few of these, and sure enough the foil and cutter are an exact match for my regular shaver, so I&#x27;ll just cannibalize these when I need replacements. Just shows how ridiculous the prices are for replacement parts. Same as printer ink and toner cartridges, I suppose -- they sell you the printer for cheap, then screw you on the supplies you need to keep it running.</li>
    <li> I purchased this electronic shaver because of the price. And I thought because it was Panasonic that it would be a quality product. WRONG!!! To be truthful it is GOD AWFUL. I should have spent the $40 for the Wahl brand.</li>
    <li> It is convenient for travel. It is only good for light shaving.</li>
    <li> For the price it is fine and does the job for a portable shaver.  I keep it in the car for a quick brush-up on a long day.</li>
    <li> This product is very good.</li>
    <li> It is a good shaver. It cleans my beard very clearly.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with a razor for nearly 40 years. I&#x27;ve seen razors go from single blade to twin blade to triple blade, and even more. Every year the blades get more ridiculous in price. Considering the price of my triple blade razors, I decided to try an electric shaver. I was really surprised to find a highly rated shaver that cost less than a pack of my triple blades. But with the Panasonic name on it, I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only shave my face, I shave my entire head, except for my goatee and eyebrows. So this little shaver gets a good workout. And I&#x27;m used to baby smooth shaves. I shave against the grain, so I leave no stubble at all. The directions with this shaver tell former blade users to use the shaver a while, and let your skin get used to the cut. And they&#x27;re right. Not only does the skin take a little time to adjust from a blade shave to a razor shave, you have to learn about which angle cuts best, and how much pressure to use while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results after one month; I get a shave very comparable to my triple blade razor, in about the same amount of time. The battery has lasted for the entire month, with nearly every day use. Cleaning takes a couple of minutes with the enclosed brush. I have not tried using the shaver &#x27;wet&#x27;, although it is said to be a &#x27;wet/dry&#x27; shaver. I prefer to keep mine dry. I have fairly oily skin, and I don&#x27;t wash my face before shaving. I feel the natural skin oils are a good lubricant. So after buying a $15 shaver, I&#x27;m saving on shaving cream and blades, and only replacing the two AA batteries about once a month. From a cost standpoint, it&#x27;s very economical. The quality of shave is excellent. The shaver itself seems well made and dependable. And if I have one complaint, it&#x27;s that I wish it had a trimmer blade, for evening up the edges of my goatee. But I can do that with my razor in about a minute, about once a month. So I have to say, this shaver is everything it should be, and maybe a little better. Definitely a good buy, and a smart purchase.. Definitely a good buy, and a smart purchase.</li>
    <li> The best little shaver ever invented. The batteries last a long time and are easy to replace. Fits in a suit case and can even used in a shower.  Can&#x27;t go wrong. Just buy it!</li>
    <li> Lost my previous one on a trip a few months ago, finally decided to get a new one. Works great for a quick shave on the road or even daily. Easy to use and simple to clean.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever. Ever since i bought this, my boyfriend hasn&#x27;t bought a razor. A of course cit free, no cuts no bleeding!</li>
    <li> It surprized me about how well it works for every day use. I would buy again not to mention the price is great.</li>
    <li> would like to order the es 3833, too, but can&#x27;t seem to find one...this is a very good shaver and nice for gifts....</li>
    <li> nice shaver for the price</li>
    <li> WOW! bought this little guy in a Walmart while on vacation when my plug-in razor died. It runs on AA batteries and works VERY WELL! I get a close shave and is small and easy to fit in any carry-on bag for flying. Or even your pocket. Cleans easy but you will need to get a tiny brush to clean out the whiskers. I use an old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Consider this and throwing away your plug-in razor!!</li>
    <li> For the price I&#x27;d figured it will live in my locker at work. But I love the wet shave options and it shave almost as well as my expensive shaver. Good deal!</li>
    <li> This is a good razor. I like the wet/dry capability of it. It shaves pretty good as long as I don&#x27;t have more than 2 days growth, but a lot of razors can&#x27;t handle that much.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel and it&#x27;s almost comparable to my full size Braun that cost over $200!  It&#x27;s nice and compact, a high quality product, gives a great shave and the batteries last a very long time.  If I didn&#x27;t have my Braun, this could be my everyday razor.  An amazing product especially for the price!</li>
    <li> It is and OK shaver. I am a little disappointed it did not have a pop-up clipper. It kind of looks like it does on the picture.</li>
    <li> I paid 13 dollars for this device.  It is well worth it in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been and am looking for a standard electric razor that is not rechargeable.  I want one that plugs in, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a Ni-CD, or Lithium battery that will go in a land fill.  Furthermore, they make the batteries not easily replaceable in those recheargeable razors.  So after the 2 years, most people end up throwing those recheargeables away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for this I settled for the next best thing.  A razor that runs on 2 regular sized AA batteries.  I am using pre-charge ni-mh battereis, that have a life span of 1000 charge cycles, and I could not be happier at this point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, the razor actually works!  So now not only do I have a camping/travel electric razor, but also one that is more green for the environment, and surprisingly works very well.  Not as good as one of those expensive razors, but good enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feels like a well made device, and for the 13 dollars I paid for it, or even the regular 19 dollars, I am glad I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase! Pull the trigger on this one, it is well worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark :)</li>
    <li> This is my second one and I really like it.  Gives a close shave on the face and removes hair on the ears when you need to that.  Very sturdy, don&#x27;t need to press very hard, and inexpensive.  Better as a matter of fact that some of the expensive electric shavers I have bought and used.</li>
    <li> First time using an electric razor today, I&#x27;m sold on it. Not quite silky smooth as a razor, but I&#x27;ll shave more often than every 2 or 3 days. I don&#x27;t care if I have stubble, but with this I won&#x27;t anymore. Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I used it after a shower.</li>
    <li> I have own one of these shavers for years now. But when I saw it on Amazon I decided to get one for my up-and-coming trip overseas. The shaver is very durable and high quality and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I prefer this one over my hundred dollar shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a more than ample job.  Have sensitive skin, so like a light shave maybe twice a day if I am going out at night. No soap, hot water, razor scrapes to deal with. Run with this a couple of minutes; hit the aftershave, and I am done.  Really much more of a razor than I had expected, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Best travel companion.  Powerful but little battery consumption.</li>
    <li> no matter how long or short my facial hair is, the shaver only takes off a little of it.</li>
    <li> Is small and easier to use and cheap, which is a plus, but it doesn&#x27;t give you a close have at all, to be honest.  If you&#x27;re after a close shave, I wouldn&#x27;t get this.</li>
    <li> Exceeded all expecations. Shaves close, totally portable, long battery life. Cut the cord!</li>
    <li> I bought a Panasonic ES38331K ($13.98), Braun M90 ($18.79) and Philips Norelco PQ208/40 ($14.97) to replace a broken travel shaver. I shaved half my face with each shaver, making three pairwise comparisons over three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic had two advantages. It was the most energetic, sounding a lot more powerful. It also was the only wet/dry shaver of the three. But the shave on the Braun was smoother. The Braun also has a built-in trimmer that works well, and the cover is integrated into the design. The Norelco was too weak, not giving a good shave. It was so weak that I changed the batteries on it, thinking that maybe the batteries were depleted, but there was no improvement with fresh batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give the Braun M90 five stars, the Panasonic four stars and the Norelco one star. Either the Braun or the Panasonic will work well as a travel shaver. Don&#x27;t waste money on the Norelco.</li>
    <li> This failed to cut any of the hair on my face. Perhaps I have abnormally thick facial hairs. Regardless, this product did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I am an electric man and this razor is the best I have ever owned. The batteries last about 3 months with everyday use.</li>
    <li> Very good item to have when traveling</li>
    <li> Veru good shaving , good for travelling and for shaving on the way to work. thenk you very much for fast shipping</li>
    <li> ...or just submerge blade in a small bowl of suds and turn the razor on. I use re-chargeable batteries and my autistic brother has found this to be the only shaver he is able to use properly. It has been our finest and now our final razor after testing dozens of them.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement and backup for my current shaver, and it is still in the packaging until my current shaver stops working.  I highly recommend this shaver and the price paid was less than the foils cost.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I have had it for more than a year.  I use it 3 or so times a week and it is still going strong.  I like that I can use AA Batteries.  I have found many rechargeable shavers to eventually no longer recharge.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two spare blades and one grill for this razor and have not had to replace the originals yet.</li>
    <li> Small,  powerful razor for when you need a quick shave while on the go. Using alkaline batteries will give you many shaves.</li>
    <li> Its adequate if you stubble is very short. Any hair over 1/8 inch will not go into the screen and not be cut, no matter how many times you drag it over your face. There must be better travel razors on the market</li>
    <li> If you aren&#x27;t picky about your razor, this is the one to get.  It will give about 10 good shaves on two AA batteries.  It cleans up easy and fast since it is waterproof. You must clean it good after use or the foil part that shields your face from the blade will rust up. Yet another good quality item provided through what we think is the best bargain around - Amazon Prime. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Excellent Good product</li>
    <li> get well operation is not usually flush AFITA</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut hair. Even with shaving cream. Junk</li>
    <li> Very good shave.  As good as $200 Panasonic shaver which loses it&#x27;s LED display after a short while.</li>
    <li> I bought the previous model (3833) many years ago as a travel shaver. I liked it so much that when my Panasonic rechargable died, I just switched to it. I have an average beard and shave every day once. The unit works well for me and surprisingly, the batteries last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The off wsitch is finally getting flakey and running the batteries down, so I may try this new version. I&#x27;ll let you know if it is as good.</li>
    <li> Blonde-haired, blue-eyed caucasian dude here. Doesn&#x27;t cut my facial hair whatsoever; using it is an exercise in futility. Full stop.</li>
    <li> Love this. I use it on my legs and chin when necessary. I also cut mens hair and use it on their faces for a cleaner shave when they didn&#x27;t have time to shave at home.</li>
    <li> this item is really a joke doesn´t shave at all! I am very disappointed with this shaver, do not buy this cheap item, you&#x27;ll regret</li>
    <li> No electric shaves as close as a blade, but this one comes close enough to allow me to forget the blade most days. Very fast compared to other electrics I have owned also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it daily for about 3 months,  and it works well.  Sometimes I miss a hair here and there, and once the hair is about 1/8 inch long or so, the razor won&#x27;t cut it.  I use a disposable razor to knock back those hairs, and the Panasonic does the rest.  I used to use a high priced Norelco, and it was good also, but the shave was no better than with this Panasonic.</li>
    <li> It is not shaving, but i could not return because of missed package. I do not recommend it. Try another type</li>
    <li> I have owned this Panasonic travel shaver for years.  Dropped it on ceramic tile and broke.  That day I ordered another.  Great shave when in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to lather up.  Don&#x27;t have a real heavy beard so can&#x27;t say how well it would work for those who have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon but for myself who has been shaving for 50 years it does a great job.  Batteries seem to last pretty long time but easy enough to throw a few new ones in when it seems to slow down a little.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it nearly every day for about 2 years. It&#x27;s quick and gives as clean a shave as you want. The washable feature makes it easy to maintain. Battery life is also great, weeks!</li>
    <li> followed all directions carefully, it seemed easy to use. Maybe theres something wrong with mine but it didn&#x27;t shave my hair off, it just cut the skin and made me bleed. everyone else seems to love it and give it great reviews but im not so sure about this product. sending it back tomorrow lol.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver and i just wanted to try one without breaking the bank. This thing cost me $10 free 2 day shipping so why not right. First it was easy to use , really shave close and you can use it wet/dry. It uses 2 double AA battery (not included ) .&lt;br /&gt;Its a nice shaver for people who doesn&#x27;t shave much but love to have a clean face everyday</li>
    <li> Great little shaver which I use while travelling. It takes a little long to shave, its a bit loud, and it doesn&#x27;t do so well around the neck. But for the tiny size and price I&#x27;m very happy with it. Best thing to do is to use it every morning that way you&#x27;re not trying to get it to cut hair that is too long and bushy.</li>
    <li> on off slide sensitive. will occasionally turn itself on.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. I tried to use it to shave my face and it literally did nothing. The only time I got any result from it was when I went over the same spot for a good 10 seconds</li>
    <li> Greatest travel shaver I have ever used.  And narrow enough head that it goes every where I want it to.</li>
    <li> this cuts NOTHING, not worth $13, no one will use it</li>
    <li> This little razor runs on batteries. It didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. It gives a great shave. Plus it is wet &#x27;n dry, so putting it in water or using water with it is not a problem.</li>
    <li> Powerful and good price.&lt;br /&gt;Quality is good and the blade is also good.&lt;br /&gt;I like extremely. Prices net of the shaver can be better.</li>
    <li> Barely used and less than a year, it stopped working.  Now, I can&#x27;t return it and can&#x27;t contact the seller!!!!</li>
    <li> An awesome shaver.  I purchased an Eltron travel shaver last summer for about the same price &amp; the Panasonic is much sturdier.  Besides that, the foils are replaceable and are heavier than on the Eltron.  There is no comparison!</li>
    <li> Works great, very portable. Very good price.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver for in or out of the shower.  I have a fairly thick beard and it does an admirable job keeping my face baby&#x27;s butt smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 23 year old grandson who doesn&#x27;t have very tough stubble. He tried it as soon as it arrived. After several minutes he came out of the bathroom with a face full of stubble. He showed me the areas he shaved, one side of his face which looked just like the other side, and under his chin which was still dark with growth. He said he tried over and over but it hardly took anything off. This was supposed to be for him to keep in the car. I also bought him another foil shaver for home. I am returning both and buying him the rotary style which does cut good.</li>
    <li> OK shaver, should have included a trimmer feature like most shavers.</li>
    <li> i give this as a gift and it still work until now. no complain at all. great items try it</li>
    <li> really like it so far</li>
    <li> Very happy with this little number. Price was right; performance was very decent for a travel shaver. It&#x27;s by no means a nanotech or rotary blade shaver but face it, if you&#x27;re looking at this product you need to balance your need for comfort with the weight you&#x27;ll carry and the aggravation of trying to recharge something on the go &amp; possibly dealing with plug adapters.&lt;br /&gt;I know when it comes to my next trip overseas I&#x27;ll take this little shaver with me again.</li>
    <li> Great razor...my step son uses this so he doesn&#x27;t cut his face all the time.</li>
    <li> Looks like a razor. Sounds like one, however, it will not shave. Great price. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I use this for trim work, not for a full shave but in a pinch I have no doubts it would work well for that. It&#x27;s small, well built and most importantly it works well. It uses batteries (2 AAs) at a much slower rate than my old Wahl travel shaver. I also have a Panasonic nose/ear trimmer and am convinced they make the best personal grooming products available. Each does its job well.</li>
    <li> Before ordering this I had either used a trimmer which didn&#x27;t get very close or a razer which sometimes takes longer than I care to invest at the time.  With this thing I trim first to get the hairs short then use this to get it close; and it gets very close.  After some use you get used to where the &#x27;edge&#x27; is and can keep your beard quite clean looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp and don&#x27;t pull your hair like others I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m honestly fairly impressed by the quality here vs the price.  Will definitely buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> out performs lesser/better known razors!!!</li>
    <li> This battery styled razor is great for on the go. It does eat the batteries quickly so have a few on hand.</li>
    <li> If this had a small beard trimmer I&#x27;d want to give it 6 stars.&lt;br /&gt;As it is, I don&#x27;t just use this when I&#x27;m traveling, I use it at home also.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basic. It only has an on/off switch, a button to release the foil cover for cleaning, and the battery compartment on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to say other than, it does what it was designed to do and it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy another one without hesitation if mine stopped working.</li>
    <li> It shaves fast and well despite the huge vibration . Glad I bought it to replace my old portable shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly can last me 2 year at least .</li>
    <li> Does the job.very reasonable for the price. It was a bargain.i needed a shaver that doesnt clean shave but still does a good job of shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend when we went on an extended vacation road trip. He said it worked well for a travel dry razor</li>
    <li> I saw this at CVS and after glancing at the high marks it got on Amazon I decided to purchase it. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could say this is useful...at all. This thing might be good for cleaning up a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for a morning shave. I&#x27;m not very experienced with electric shavers, but it seems to just be ripping the hairs out and couldn&#x27;t cut them at all. This is especially pathetic because I do NOT grow a thick or aggressive beard. I have thin hair folicles and a patchy beard and this thing is just useless for me. I was able to get a decent shave...eventually, but it took at least ten minutes and it was not a close shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that this shaver requires double A batteries which I would consider a huge negative. It might be useful for a travel bag if it had an internal battery, but personally I am trying to eliminate all devices from my life that require disposable batteries which are expensive and harmful to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is really just a complete miss, please don&#x27;t be fooled by the high overall rating this thing gets, it is a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> As far as shaving goes, this is a good choice for a travel shaver, , the blade is sharp and can do its job at blinding speed, making the shaver itself very reliable at what it does.</li>
    <li> I purchased this little battery shaver and was blown away buy its performance.  I used it every day in the shower with foam shaving cream (just a dab will do ya).  Absolutely amazing.  Powerful. Good &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; shave and close with no stubble.  It is fast just one or two passes and it&#x27;s shaved that area.  I have another high dollar shaver and I have to run that thing like six times in the same area to get all stubble. Not with this little baby.  Highly recommend.  And it is fully water proof.  Batteries last about three weeks.  Easy to replace.</li>
    <li> To sharp for my skin left my legs with burning sensation</li>
    <li> This is a great little travel shaver, works very well. I carry this in my work bag to get a quick shave when on the road.    Unfortunatly, it appears Amazon has taken over the sale of this nifty item, and so the price I paid, $7.99 with free shipping, is no longer applicable. Seems the giant saw a bargain and scooped.     Bottom line: at 7.99 w/free ship it was a great deal. at 16.99 plus shipping, not so much.     I wish I had bought 6...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all disspaointed</li>
    <li> Electric razors give me a better shave on my neck under the chin but I really dislike rechargeable batteries because they wear out and then are difficult/expensive to replace.  I like the simplicity of razors that uses AA batteries.  I&#x27;ve used Remingtons and Brauns for years but the last two (one of each brand) had the same design weakness to the battery cover which is part of the electrical circuit.  The Panasonic use a much sturdier battery cover and it also shaves very nicely.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, very well built and works well.</li>
    <li> My Shick single blade corded razor stopped working due to the cord wearing out over the years. I&#x27;ve had a couple of other brand name cordless/rechargeable  razors (about 10 years) that were good but wore out much sooner. After shopping around for a single blade shaver, which was not easy, I found three travel models, one being the Panasonic. The issue I had with the razor was the batteries. How could this shaver have the power and precision of a corded or rechargeable? When I looked at the reviews for it they seemed to be mostly positive. Besides, @ $13.98 I could give it to my grandson who will be shaving in a few years. I turned it on and it sounded just like the aforementioned razors. I also noticed that the quality of the razor itself, the blade guard, the battery compartment, and the foil was as good or better than I had experienced with other shavers. I have a beard, so a lot of shaver kind of gets in the way when I shave my neck and cheek areas. This shaver is ergonomic and fits in your hand well. I tried the wet shave and it worked fine but found it unnecessary because it was very comfortable and gave a good shave dry. I&#x27;ve had it about a month so have shaved about 20-25 times. The batteries are still pretty charged up, so it would seem that the unit/motor is pretty efficient. In summation, I did something I usually don&#x27;t do and that was to purchase a second razor in case I drop it because it seems that single blade razors are not being manufactured as much as they used to be.</li>
    <li> An excellent product requiring no maintenance. I ordered it a a replacement for my existing shaver which is also a Panasonic make.</li>
    <li> Best Travel Shaver ever bought, took it on my trip to Peru. Used 1 set of batteries for 3 weeks and shaved every other day. Great size and quality!</li>
    <li> For many years, I’ve been using one of those well-known electric razors with the three floating heads.  I’ve always been satisfied with the clean shave it gives me, but I’ve also been annoyed by the amount of time it takes to get it.  Seems like it’s necessary to go over the same area again and again to finally get everything shaved off clean.  For me, shaving has always been a necessary nuisance and I had hoped that changing over to an electric razor would lessen the daily drudgery.  It didn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, on a whim, I bought one of these little Panasonic battery-operated razors.  I knew that the cutting technology was different from what I was using and I wanted to see how well it performed.  After all, fourteen bucks wasn’t going to break me if it didn’t work.  I placed my order and three days later, my new toy arrived.  Time to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!  Color me impressed!  Very, very favorably impressed.  Just one pass over any area of skin with two days of beard growth resulted in a dead-smooth shave.  No scrubbing necessary.  No need to go over the same area again and again.  I got a totally clean shave in about one-third the time it took with my old electric razor.  I’m totally delighted with the performance of this Panasonic razor.  I can’t find anything to criticize about it.  It has a pleasing appearance, it’s well balanced, it’s easy to maneuver around the little nooks and crannies of your face and it just plain feels good in your hand.  This little razor almost makes shaving fun.  Almost, I said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one caveat though: While this thing works great for removing one or two days of beard growth, it doesn’t work very well at removing longer growth.  That’s because in order to be cut off, hairs must first be able to enter the tiny holes in the shaving head’s thin metal foil so that they are exposed to the cutter blades on the other side of the foil.  Short hairs do this easily.  But longer ones get pushed over on their side and the foil simply slides over them.  They don’t enter the holes, so they don’t get severed by the cutters.  With enough scrubbing and scouring, you can eventually get these longer hairs cut off too, but by then your face may be pretty raw and you’ll probably decide that all the extra work and effort just isn’t worth it.  For me, that’s when I break out my old blade razor.  The simplest solution, of course, is to not go more than two or three days without shaving.  Keeps the wife happy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I would most definitely recommend this product to a family member, or friend, or anyone else who wants to lessen the drudgery of their daily shave.  Well done, Panasonic!</li>
    <li> My husband is always in a hurry and he loves this shaver  to use on the go.  It&#x27;s perfect for on the go.</li>
    <li> So far I have nothing bad to stay about this product. It does exactly what it advertises!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Filler Words, haha)</li>
    <li> Please guys don&#x27;t buy this item because it doesn&#x27;t work I put batteries in it and do all the step I need to do it still dnt work i just lost my money..</li>
    <li> for the price was extremely impressed by this little razor would recommend to any one for the car / work at home</li>
    <li> This is a battery operated travel electric trimmer. Good quality and cutting performance, it&#x27;s up to Panasonic standards. I have a larger Panasonic shaver and the results are similar. The larger provides a closer shave but I think the same results can be achieved with this one with more than one pass or through wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have a sideburns trimmer. Other than that, excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Used one own by a relative and had to have my own.</li>
    <li> I like that this is small, and it works.  It&#x27;s not the best shave, and you have to either be willing to go over your face again, or accept that this is a cheap, small, battery powered travel shaver with limitations.  Nothing heinous, but don&#x27;t expect to have sexy ladies run up to you in the street to rub your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powered by 2xAA batteries, and I&#x27;d trust those batteries for a week, and they&#x27;ll last about a week and a half.  That&#x27;s with running over my face for a few minutes each morning, not simply a single run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with a small brush to clean it, and you&#x27;ll want to clean it every few days.  There&#x27;s a plastic protective cover to the foil, and it snaps on, but I put the entire system in a ziploc bag before I toss it in any luggage.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my old Panasonic similar razor but the head mesh was bad and cutting my face.  This one does not cut anywhere as good as the 25 year old one did.</li>
    <li> it was totally unsatisfactory.  To test it I used it on my arm and it did not take of even one hair.</li>
    <li> Great price. This is my card companiorn</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver for the less than the price of a set of blades and foil on other shaver brands. I have had mine for two years and have not had to change the blade or foil. Batteries last a long time too.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, nice shape, but didn&#x27;t work at all.  It was replaced 2 times but that didn&#x27;t help.  The replacement sent didn&#x27;t work at all.  Wouldn&#x27;t even power up.</li>
    <li> I used to be a Norelco rotary shaver man.  The built-in batteries on the first Norelco I bought lasted over 15 years.  The batteries in the 2nd Norelco I bought lasted 3 years.  I wear a beard and only shave once a month when I trim it up.  I decided to try this dispossible battery Panasonic shaver for 13 bux instead of another Norelco for 4 times the price.  It works fine and I really don&#x27;t think I have to work any harder with it than the rotary type.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT shaver - works as good as any chargable for 4 times the dollars. Only thing it does not have the &amp;#34;Side burn&amp;#34; trimmer which I use on my neck for long missed hairs. So I keep a cheepo razor in the car with me for those. This is my on way to work Shaver and it&#x27;s GREAT! AA Batteries last 3 or so months if not longer using the razor just about every day or every other. I will order a 2nd as a back up or in my 2nd vehicle. It&#x27;s Panasonic - they still make GREAT quality products. $13.00 January 2014 - this is a very good price for this item.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected. Batteries last a very long time. When at home I do prefer my home shaver as it performs much better. Considering the price and size it is perfect for me when travelling but I would not recommend it for every day unless you have a gentle beard.</li>
    <li> The first screen and blade work fine.  When it comes time to change the screen and blade you will be in for a big disappointment.  The screen id designed with four clips that hold the screen in place.  When installing the replacement screen, you need a special tool engage the screen with the clip.  The tool is more expensive than the shaver itself</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much of this shaver, but based on all the good reviews on amazon, I thought it would at least work decently well for a few weeks. I used this once, and I felt like it was the longest shave of my life. First I tried a dry shave. I had quite a bit of hair already grown out and at first I saw a little hair off the top getting shaved off but after about 10 minutes of shaving, I still had HUGE patches of hair all over my face. I was getting tired of holding the crazy vibrating shaver and my face started to feel like it was going to rip off, so I switched over to a wet shave. Even tried putting on some shaving cream and doing it that way. Nothing I tried would even get half the hair. Finally after part of my face started bleeding I decided to just give up on it entirely and grabbed my regular size panasonic shaver to finish the job. 2 minutes later I was done, but no thanks to this piece of junk. Even though my regular shaver is a foil shaver, and generally I like how close of a shave foil shavers give, I decided to go ahead and give the norelco travel rotary shaver a shot, and that little guy does the job even better than my full size panasonic! Might not be quite as close of a shave, but took half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I noticed on the packaging that panasonic offered a \\&quot;30-day money back guarantee\\&quot;. I was like, ok great, it&#x27;s a piece of junk, but at least they stand by their piece of junk. Called up customer service, and told them the situation and the woman on the phone told me to send it to amazon where I bought it from. I tried to explain to her that the guarantee was from panasonic and that Amazon did not provide the guarantee, hence the fact that I&#x27;m calling Panasonic. So we go back and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;forth for awhile and I give up and say, ok, maybe transfer me to tech support. So she doesn&#x27;t end up transferring me anywhere, I get put in a huge wait queue again and end up getting the parts department. Tell her I needed tech support, wait another15 minutes or so and finally I get tech support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I start explaining to this air head on the phone what the problem is and that I want to use the promised guarantee. Again, she tells me the same thing... \\&quot;send it to amazon, you didn&#x27;t buy it directly from us... blah blah blah\\&quot;. So I calmly try to explain to her that the guarantee was NOT from amazon, I feel bad returning something I opened and tried out to amazon when it is absolutely not their fault Panasonic&#x27;s product sucks and that PANASONIC offered a guarantee. I know Amazon would take the return, but a return is different than a guarantee. So she starts arguing with me for like 10 minutes and throwing out all kinds of pointless analogies which were completely wrong and unprofessional. I&#x27;ve never been treated like a complete moron on the phone like this woman treated me. In the end, I asked for her supervisor, she said she would transfer me, so she put me on hold for another 10 minutes until I finally just gave up and hung up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this experience I&#x27;m going to make a conscious effort to avoid Panasonic products for now on.</li>
    <li> The seller, Pana-Pacific is pretty good, fast shipping &amp; no issue.    The shaver is ok, cheap, runs fine, but not as good as my Braun pocketgo.</li>
    <li> These days I spend so much time at work and school that I have started to practically live out of my backpack.  This little shaver is a great size and does the job quite well.  I&#x27;m surprised by how long standard AA batteries last in this unit.  This was an excellent deal and very good quality.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to easily remove the blade cover and then rinse the blades (while running) under water.  I just wish this thing had a trimmer!</li>
    <li> Works great, almost a good as the full size Panasonic. Use it several times a year and always am pleased with the close shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use while traveling. it is compact and easily fits in your hand bag leaving room for other items. I like the battery operation, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about recharging. Battery use time is plenty for travel purposes. Performance is quite adequate. I recommend this to anyone looking for a simple. reliable shaver for travel.</li>
    <li> not good at all for thick beards. Maybe if you just have to do a light trim, but really not a great light trim.</li>
    <li> Own two, very powerful, never a problem shaving so far.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Well designed and robust construction. Looks like it will last a while. Easy to clean. Does not need a charger and so far good battery life (alkaline).  Only downside - no trimmer  -  not a big deal for me.</li>
    <li> Put in two battery&#x27;s an your good to go....Been getting a great shave ever morning for a month on two battery&#x27;s. For the price this is a real deal.</li>
    <li> Not too bad for a single foil razor. The problem is if you let your facial hair grow too long, because you then have to spend a ton of time going over the same area again and again and again. The shorter the facial hair, the better the shave. I did use shaving cream one time and it seemed to work pretty good, but there were still a few long hairs that were missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is perfect for travel given the size and that is is battery powered. I will use this for travel to Europe later in the year (no need to worry about power conversion) but I will take a single razor to get the hairs that this misses and I&#x27;ll take a small can of shaving cream to lessen the irritation of going over the same area again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and do like that you can wet shave with it AND that is the saving grace of this travel razor; otherwise, I would have shipped it back and found something else.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these, when they get dull I trash them as the replacement blade and foil costs more than this razor.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver! The only negative is that when the batteries get weak it doesn&#x27;t shave as well. I use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> This shaver is simple and reliable. I can shave quickly with it, and it&#x27;s easy to clean. Yes, one gets a closer shave with a blade, but this unit allows a presentable appearance in a fraction of the time that it takes to shave with a razor.</li>
    <li> very compact design, strong power. Although it is defined as travel shaver, I use it daily and don&#x27;t find any problem.</li>
    <li> This is really the best travel shaver ever.&lt;br /&gt;It is light, cuts reasonably close - quite close, really, and it trims when needed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had 3 of them and if I lose this one, I will get another.&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding shave, small light package, uses AA batteries, priced right.&lt;br /&gt;If you need or want a travel shaver- go for it!</li>
    <li> The thing works perfect, affordable, small, compact, battery really last long....months. The only problem is if you didn&#x27;t shave in the last three days the shaver wont be able to lift the hairs that are bent down so it will be a messy uneven shave what you will get. bummer...remember does not have a trimmer so that wont help either. Besides even if you use it every day some hairs will be missed and get to long for this shaver. Other than that is great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely AMAZING how they made and sell it for the price. Works just as well as the rechargeable Panasonic I had for 20 years and eventually wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and the replacement head and cutter cost MORE than this whole razor.&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts about 40 shaves, and you CAN use, and recharge a NiMH AA battery if you like.</li>
    <li> This is one of the very best shavers out on the market! Better than Norelco for sure even though it is single blade!&lt;br /&gt;the price is just great and my husband uses it not only on the road ! he prefers it in front of the Norelco 7310. Great quality product, Smooth shave!</li>
    <li> A perfect shaver for travelling. Its small, light and inexpensive and uses regular AA batteries. Plus you can use it in the shower. What is there not to like ?</li>
    <li> Does what it says, charge lasts a while if using just to touch up, replacing foil and cutters? Couldn&#x27;t work out if possible so maybe not good for long term.</li>
    <li> Used over a month on vaction and works great takes a little longer to finish, but works great.</li>
    <li> Blasts through the task quite well.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver, have been using for abut six months and still going strong. I use rechargeable batteries and they work well and last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought two more of them for future use.</li>
    <li> I buy one of these every year.  It cuts fairly close, and for my beard and mustache, it fits better than any of the larger, more expensive models.  You have to replace the heads on those every year, too, but they cost $50 or more, and they can&#x27;t get between my nose and the mustache!</li>
    <li> My older double bladed Panasonic seemed a little lighter and shaved better .... I wish they still made the old model.  But this one does the job.</li>
    <li> I used to like this razor.  Even though fragile, it gives a good shave for an electric.  And it used to have a nice wide beard shaver -- which has since DISAPPEARED!!!    BRING BACK THE BEARD TRIMMER!!</li>
    <li> this shaver does a very good job of shaving. But if you have long hairs, you need to use the the cutter (which slides down) to remove them. This shaver would be better if it had a double blade.but for the price of the shaver I can&#x27;t comoplain. The recharge gives you about twenty minutes of shaving time,although it takes about 8 hours to recharge (can be done overnight) which is more than enough for about twenty shaves. I would recommend buying this shaver from Amazon to my friends. It&#x27;s a excellent price.</li>
    <li> Very close shave reliable good price.</li>
    <li> Just awful and a waste of my money.  If you have heavy, thick beard growth then you will find this razor worthless.  The screen mesh is way too fine: too small.  I guess it might work for people with fine facial hair but for me it just stinks. I go over my face several times and it just won&#x27;t get it all up.  What were they thinking of when they manufactured this?  Might be okay for peach fuzz types but for coarser thicker stubble it&#x27;s simply no good. It sucks bad.  Get a Braun travel razor instead.</li>
    <li> It gives a nice touch-up shave and is small so it packs in travel bag or briefcase.  Great, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> didnt like, worst razor</li>
    <li> Awesome little shaver. It won&#x27;t replace a more expensive razor, or a blade, but it is great to have in a pinch. I keep it in the car for those days when I need a little cleanup or I missed a spot. Works as well as razors twice the price, in my experience.</li>
    <li> The best cheap portable shaver I&#x27;ve found after buying two others that I threw out.     Beats my best home shaver, IF, has a good battery in it.     As the battery ages it gets weak and won&#x27;t fully cut. But the batteries do last decently.</li>
    <li> Nicely powerful for a AA-powered shaver.  I like it since I always have rechargeable Ni-MH AA batteries around the house and can use fresh ones often.  Will run on a pair of AAs with lots of power for at least several shaves, enough for a several-day trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the ultimate battery life is, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that I&#x27;ve taken a couple of nicks below my nose with this shaver, however (thus 4 stars).  Not sure if/how that&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s happened  more than once.  In any event, I find it to provide a close shave.</li>
    <li> cheap and good to use</li>
    <li> Nice electric shaver.  Use mine with rechargeable batteries on my cheeks when I don&#x27;t have time to wet shave.  I have to use it very lightly on my neck just to get the hair trimmed down a little.  Not to get a close shave because it will tear up my skin.  I can only use a straight razor on my neck every few days or else I get bad burn.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a cruise and loved it -- now my everyday shaver.  Small and compact with a great shaver head.  Easy cleanup -- just rinse under the faucet.  My wife borrowed it for her legs -- both she and our daughter requested one for Christmas.  Great gift idea.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and solid and very convenient..... it just doesn&#x27;t cut your hair.  I have a broken whal peanut that I have to hold the blade in place by hand for it to work..... and It still shaves way cleaner than this.  Best to pay some more and get a better quality shaver.</li>
    <li> Awesome little shaver. Takes a few days/weeks to get your face used to using it to get a closer shave. It&#x27;s by far the smoothest shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend. No trimmer though</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all, waste of money and now I only have some cuts in my face... Cheap but it&#x27;s crap</li>
    <li> Replacement for an older one that just wore out.  Very happy even the second time around</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now. First of all, I&#x27;m a girl, so I use it for places a girl would use it. I use it for quick trims if I&#x27;m getting dressed and I realize I have a little stubble that I didn&#x27;t get to in the shower. And sometimes, I just don&#x27;t like irritating my skin with the blade razor, you know? Haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries YET! a VERY handy tool for $15.</li>
    <li> ihave been using this type of shaver for 2yrs I wore out I was glad to find it on amazon so I ordered two of them they give a really great shave and&lt;br /&gt;run on two double a batteries of about six weeks wvwn with daily use.</li>
    <li> This shaver is handy, has a powerful motor, works in the wet, and cleans easy. I find though that I&#x27;ve gotta work certain spots over and over, and sometimes it still won&#x27;t cut...so it&#x27;s only ok.</li>
    <li> This product was perfect! Gives me a good clean shave and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It doesnt cut unless you have a full beard. Stubble will be untouched.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver a couple of years ago to use as a daily razor.  It was really inexpensive and worked so well I decided to buy a second one for a spare.  It&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price-never have yet to find an electric razor worth a ----,even with all preshave stuff I put on-but it works 3 star worth..</li>
    <li> powerfull machine but dont take all the hair on the nack and mostash</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t meet my expectation</li>
    <li> My husband is confined to bed for a while and wanted to shave, but NOT with a shaver. He has always hated them.  Balancing and juggling a razor and water in bed was getting old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got him this, took it out of the package and handed it to him with his several-days worth of whiskers. &amp;#34;Here, try this.&amp;#34; Having nothing to do at the time, he decided to give it a whirl. &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;, he said. &amp;#34;This is not tugging at all.&amp;#34; Several minutes later, he was clean-shaven and all was good in the kingdom. Now I hear him shaving each day and telling everyone how much he has been missing when there exists a shaver like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver is a breeze. Just follow the directions to put a little soap and water on the head, turn it on and let it rip. Take it apart, dry it off and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a steal for the price! Try this before you try one of the expensive guys. You may find it is all you need.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. Just threw this out. I had skin injuries when used for the first time. Went for other brand and it works fine for me.</li>
    <li> Works very well and I love it. Very good for the price!! So good I&#x27;m glad I ordered 2 of them</li>
    <li> Nice handy razor...I like it</li>
    <li> Works great on thick course hair &amp; for a (closer) shave you must use water w/ a lather for this shaver!!&lt;br /&gt;  Best for a long lasting foil !!!!</li>
    <li> Received it quickly. At first my face barely had any hair and it failed to cut anything. I waited a couple days and it did very spot fully. Definitely not worth it and I gave it to a friend and he also had no luck.</li>
    <li> Wanted a compact unit without rechargeable batteries that lasted a long time - this is it. The screen shaves comfortabley as long as you do not wait too long between shaves as it has a hard time with very long whiskers. Nicely built and engineered.  As for being a travel shaver - that it is - but I just bought another for regular use. Said goodnye to my rotary.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 14 year old son to start shaving his mustache.  My husband and I joked that it was a &amp;#34;junior razor&amp;#34; because it was so inexpensive and compact.  However it is sturdy and keeps the charge, I&#x27;m sure he will be able to use it for many years.</li>
    <li> Got it for my husband. Since he is in the Army he needs to be shaven and clean cut all the time. Comes in handy. He loves it. No complaints from him.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat these shavers</li>
    <li> Shaves close and quickly, runs for weeks on a single charge of the rechargeable batteries I put in. It&#x27;s compact.  Just what I needed for international travel without the bother of searching out fresh batteries. It take a little time to get use to the vibration.</li>
    <li> takes a few passes to get a decent shave, but I use it daily and got rid of the other shavers!  at $13/piece this wet/dry is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Definitly would pick another one just to have a spare in the car etc..</li>
    <li> I have a fine selection of English,and German safety,razors which I have&lt;br /&gt;been using for the past several years.&lt;br /&gt;Due to medical problems,the Dr. advised me to store them away,and&lt;br /&gt;get an electric razor.Perish the thought.&lt;br /&gt;Bought the Panasonic,battery powered travel razor,and I must say,&lt;br /&gt;it gives a shave 80% as good as the safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Definetely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this travel shaver about a year ago, and it has been perfect for my needs.    In a nutshell  If you&#x27;re looking for a compact, self-contained electric shaver for your typical business trip or vacation, this one deserves a permanent place in your travel bag.  If you&#x27;re Grizzly Adams looking for an everyday shaver, disappointment will undoubtedly ensue.    What I Like  -Compact and light: It&#x27;s for travel, so the smaller and lighter the better...but not Motorola RAZR small.  This shaver was a nice size that fits nicely in my hand.  -Runs on batteries: I don&#x27;t want to have to lug a charger around or worry about charging beforehand.  Batteries are readily available in most places, and I didn&#x27;t want any cords or plug issues when I spontaneously spend a weekend in Brussels.  -Shaves reasonably well: I&#x27;m willing to sacrifice some \\&quot;shavability\\&quot; to get the compact size I wanted, but I don&#x27;t want to spend 15 minutes running this thing across my face 10 times to get it clean cut. This shaver has been more than adequate.  Shaving daily, I get the cut I want in a single pass in most instances.    Things that Didn&#x27;t Bother Me Because This is for Travel  -Noise/Vibration: It is a bit noisy and probably vibrates more than a $100 shaver, but I use this in hotel bathrooms and tents, not libraries.    Final Comments  I&#x27;ve taken this on about 10 or 12 trips covering about 35 or 40 days, and I&#x27;m still on the first set of batteries.  I&#x27;ve been really happy with it, and for under twenty bucks, I consider it one of my best purchases.  If it had a pop-up trimmer, I&#x27;d be be hosting Panasonic ES3831K Single Blade Travel Shaver parties.  As it is though, I won&#x27;t travel without it.</li>
    <li> I had two Braun M90s for about 10 years and used them alternately every day.  Finally, one of the screens broke and when I decided to replace it, I ordered a Braun 60B and this Panasonic ES3831K because I did not know how much longer the M90 was going to last.  I am now using all three and they all perform beautifully.  If you ask me to rate the three, I would rate them very close but this one would be number one and M90 would be #2 and M60B would be 3rd, but this is only my rating and they are equally good which is why it is so hard to rate them.  But I did.  I would recommend any of the three to anyone.  I use these as my primary shaving instrument.</li>
    <li> I use this in my go bag, I put rechargeable batteries in it, and have a solar charger so I can use it anywhere!  Its a pretty powerful little razor and shaves very close.</li>
    <li> So far seems very reliable and hearty for a small mobile shaver   and glad it has rereplacement parts...</li>
    <li> I miss old &amp;#34;cord&amp;#34; (Braun) electric shavers. They were powerful long lasting machines.&lt;br /&gt;Today you must pay more than USD 100 for some of the new &amp;#34;cordeless&amp;#34; and basically are battery operated.&lt;br /&gt;So....buy a battery operated for USD 15 and save your money.&lt;br /&gt;And you know what ? The batteries of this machine last longer that the big &amp;#34;sister&amp;#34; cordless Braun that I have&lt;br /&gt;yo plug to the wall.</li>
    <li> This is surprisingly good for a travel razor. In fact, it is just as good as some of the more expensive electric razors I have used.</li>
    <li> Greatest bargain I can get for a portable shaver.  The only thing it lacks is a trimmer.  Otherwise, this is a great shaver.  It shaves fairly well compare to many shavers in the $40-$80 range.  It&#x27;s great for everyday use and two AA batteries will last you more than a month.  Much more convenient that the rechargeable ones.  Great, great bargain for the price.</li>
    <li> For the price this thing is Awesome!</li>
    <li> This shaver can not shave well and it is very noisy. I do not recommend this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Instead I bought Panasonic ES8103S 3-Blade Wet/Dry Shaver. This is more expensive than this shaver. But it works very well and has convenient features. I think buying better one is good long term investment.</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR SHAVED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I DIDNT HAVE THE TIME OR ENERGY TO SEND IT BACK. IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
    <li> WORST THING I&#x27;VE EVER BOUGHT. 15 BUCKS TO CUT MY FACE, NO REFUNDS, THANKS A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;m sorry about the caps, I know they are obnoxious. They stole 15 dollars from me though, this did not remove the hair but it shaved my skin off. I used foil shavers before, this was NOT user error.</li>
    <li> My 25 year old corded Braun shaver broke recently.  After finding very few corded shavers for sale, I decided to give this \\&quot;Travel\\&quot; shaver a try.   For the price ($14) of a replacement blade for other shavers I got this entire shaver.  It works and works well for everyday shaving - I didn&#x27;t buy it for travel. It shaves almost as close my old Braun and with no irritation ... and I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I used this razor for over 3 weeks so far and the batteries are still running strong. It does a great job and the price is reasonable. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews here beforehand &amp; figured the price was so low I couldn&#x27;t lose (or waste any more time agonizing over a $14 purchase). It seems to me that individual differences in skin and stubble thickness contribute to the wildly varying opinions.   For me, it&#x27;s a winner, though it&#x27;s true that it does take quite a few passes to get silky smooth, if that&#x27;s your preference. Works in the shower, works dry and is very portable with a VERY long lasting battery life on two fresh AAs. Also, it feels good in the hand. That&#x27;s important to me and I appreciate its solid build quality and contours. It&#x27;s tight as a drum construction-wise, which is very nice and usually not to be expected for the minimal cost. The cover for the foil is sturdy and clips on very well too. I&#x27;ve had many that barely stay on and get lost quickly. Not so here. A nice touch that most companies seem to view as an afterthought.  In short, I love it and will be buying another as a spare.</li>
    <li> I purchased the ES3831 to add to my other Panasonic wet/dry ES7801 (which is discontinued) for my daily use as a road warrior. Man was I disappointed.  The ES7801 has double blades and provides a great shave that leaves my face, neck and head clean and smooth. On the other hand the ES3831 has only one blade and is unable to do the same. Granted I have not tried shaving in the shower using but I will and then add the results to this review.&lt;br /&gt;The ES7801 used 2 3v batteries instead of 2 AAA&#x27;s and was more powerful. It is beyond my understanding why the mfg would replace a double bladed razor with only one blade?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need the &#x27;K&#x27; model as I keep my hair long and carry a small scissors when I travel. And as another reviewer noted it came with no case. As the saying goes \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot; A cheap price for a cheap razor.</li>
    <li> A great shaver. I use it at and away from home. After a years use I replace. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. I had a silmilar but made by Phillip. They are all good,. small, easy and convenient...</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic ES3831K Travel Shaver.  Originally got one for travel purposes.  Use it daily now.</li>
    <li> Great little razor, hubby likes it!</li>
    <li> This is a great little shaver.  Light, small, and easily washable with water and soap. Very impressed with its convenience.  The price is very cheap too.  I&#x27;ve had it for more than 3 months now, and haven&#x27;t changed the two regular AA batteries I put in at the beginning. I do a quick shave 4-5 times a week.  Very impressed the batteries would last this long.  On other rechargeable ones, I would have had to recharge after a week or two, even brand new ones.  Then after a few months, you have to charge every other day.  But with this shaver, you don&#x27;t charge.  You just put in two AA batteries, and that&#x27;s it.  Then they lasted for well over 3 months for me!  However, the shaver, as nice and good as it is, doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as some other shavers I had - e.g. Norelco or Braun shavers.  I even had a bigger, rechargeable Panansonic once before, and it shaved a little closer, but this one, while doing a descent job, doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as others did.  It has to do with the blade not lifting the hair.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.  It shaves close enough for me.  It wouldn&#x27;t been perfect if it came with a trimmer too, but at this price and convenience, it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Good touch-up/back-up shaver to take with on vacation or short business trip but I would not trade it with my regular Remington foil shaver.  The shave of the Panasonic ES3831K is okay but definitely not as clean as my Remington shaver.  Not bad for AA battery charger though.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and comfortable to use. This is my best shaver. I love it.</li>
    <li> For the price you can not go wrong. It goes above and beyond and works great. Very close shave. Make sure you do not let your hair grow out too much before use or else it might take extra time to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have two of these great shavers, the first delivered on March 9, 2015 and the second on March 23, 2015.  I am an older American male with a tough beard and I shave daily.  I have tried numerous electric shavers over the years, including battery driven.  This shaver is the only one I have ever found to give me a satisfactory shave.  I also purchased one for my son and am, today, ordering one for my son-in-lay and one of my grandsons.  My greatest surprise is that after shaving, either at the YMCA or at home daily since installing the first batteries, I have continued to shave on those original batteries.  I actually thought that my wife had secretly installed batteries as a joke.  However, she denies the same and she does not have access to my shaver at the Y.  I have other Panasonic shavers including a full size wet/dry that is either electric or battery driven.  I will stop now so as to not appear to exaggerate too much.  Still, this ES3831K is an outstanding shaver.</li>
    <li> Handy and small. Hubby loves it.  Easy to keep clean .  Still going strong and haven&#x27;t replaced any parts!  Excellent price</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for at least 2 years now, and I am hands down completely satisfied with this. As first I thought that this is cheap so I am ready to use and throw this away, but it have great quality, it is easy to use and fast to use, it takes only a few seconds and I use this every day. Now the only thing I needed to throw away is my battery.</li>
    <li> Works decently enough if you have short stubbles no longer than a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow. Anything bigger and you&#x27;ll be going at it for a while. For the price, its decent enough to keep in a car, at work, or use on vacation to keep up with a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Great travel razor that I keep in my truck in case I get called out and need to shave while I am in route. I love the fact that it uses simple batteries that are available anywhere. My only complaint is that it does not have a trimmer for shaping sideburns. Like all wet dry trimmers I recommend never letting it get wet. Moister is the true enemy of the razor not your beard. Your beard will never dull a razor, but moisture will. Just pop it open and clean it with a dry old toothbrush and perhaps a little compressed air. It will stay sharp a very very long time.</li>
    <li> We like this Shaver. Smooth foil doesn&#x27;t pull or nick your skin. cuts hairs you can here when it cuts a hair. The hairs go into this shaver better too than another we have tried. Some shavers hurt skin this one does not. had it several months. The price on this was so cheap we had to try it and are glad we did. It does not have a cover like the Braun but it does have a snap on plastic foil cover. We have owned a Braun Pocket shaver and really liked it. We bought another Braun. But so far we are just using this Panasonic. Much cheaper and Good value. In April 2013 I paid $12.51 with super saver free shipping needing to order $25. minimum. It was cheaper a few minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;Don wanted to order Braun Mobile Shave too just in case he did not like this one. He will use it when the other quits cutting.</li>
    <li> I bought thinking it was a big deal because of the past reviews, but it was a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to shave with this and it didn&#x27;t work. It just hurt my skin. I now have a nice piece of junk in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I was really exited on getting this for its low price nd everything but it does NOT work! all it did was burn my face afterwards i DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS ITEM IT DOES NOT WORK :( AND MY FACE STILL HURTS IM GOING TO SEE IF I CAN REFUND IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Panasonic battery powered shaver for over a year, and I love it.  I&#x27;ve owned a couple of other models, but the Panasonic Travel Shaver is by far the best of the bunch.  It is very well made with quality materials.  The battery compartment is easy to access and takes two standard AA alkaline batteries which power the unit a long time.  Removing the flex screen and cleaning the shaving head is quick and simple.  And the shaver gives a reasonably smooth, close shave.  I keep the shaver in my travel bag along with other essentials so I am always ready for my next road trip.  This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Not fannsy as other shavers but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Unless you shave everyday with this it will not work.</li>
    <li> amazing! I owned a similar product 20 yrs ago and this one rocks. It runs on 2 aa - which i have 20 some rechargeable - but id hate to use regular batteries in it.&lt;br /&gt;close, fast shave, and i have pretty sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Works great ! Couldn&#x27;t wait to hop in the shower and try it.&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed. !!!&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Richard Dee&lt;br /&gt;AutoLeasingGroup@cs.com</li>
    <li> Really handy for traveling and/or quick shaves. Hubby has three now and says he is spoiled with the convenience of the item. Replacement outer foil and inner blade are available through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste $$ on the expensive shavers, this does the job just as well &amp; the compact size is perfect</li>
    <li> This razor is pretty cheap on price but it is worth every single dollar. It&#x27;s a great powerful razor and trust my words &amp;#34;ITS WORTH IT&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This replaces my previous Panasonic that finally broke after several years of service - it lasted much longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;This new version does not have the sideburn trimmer. But I don&#x27;t mind. The trimmer would often get in the way if turning on the razor \\&quot;too far\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Hairs that are allowed to get too long are an issue. This is because this does not have the longer slit head that expensive razors include.&lt;br /&gt;So I have to use my big Panasonic, or fingernail scissors for those. Small price to pay for a razor that is lighter and easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;On my previous model I used rechargeable batteries from Costco - but a charge would not last long.&lt;br /&gt;This time I got the Sanyo charger with 4 batteries (named eneloop) from Amazon and they hold the charge far better.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic probably doesn&#x27;t want you to read this review - how can they make money on such an inexpensive shaver?</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES3831K is a very good portable shaver that does the job well.  I use it more as a wet shaver since I prefer it that way and have been impressed with the results.Keeps things neat when you are on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is small enough to pack, and lightweight, so it is easy to travel with which is nice with restrictions on carry-on sizes. With the features, performance and price, I highly recommend it to those looking for a travel shaver.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this choice.</li>
    <li> I am in the United States Military. It goes without saying that because of that, I am required to be clean shaven everyday. Every once in a while, I&#x27;ll run out of the house without getting a good clean shave which makes for a very bad day. Disclaimer: I actually hate electric shavers because they irritate my skin. I shave most days with an old-fashioned safety razor, shave brush, and bar shave soap, which is the absolute best shave of my life so far; however, there are downsides to the safety razor method: time. Enter the electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit, I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to do a really good test with this shaver on thicker beards, only early morning stubble. In that regard it performs incredibly well. On a dry shave it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face too much and even less so on a wet shave. It&#x27;s a fantastic, \\&quot;ooops I forgot to shave!,\\&quot; razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a very small brush to clean the head as well as a plastic protector that covers the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Very portable! Stays in my glove compartment.&lt;br /&gt;Battery powered.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean / Maintain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Irritation on face due to the back and forth vibrating razor head. (although Panasonic does suggest you shave with the product for 30 days to allow your skin to adjust.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck shaving!</li>
    <li> I like this for the price it works great I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and got no complaints, I would recommend this for anyone in the military or anyone who needs something for daily use.</li>
    <li> Works well, seems to be very powerful for a travel shave.  A deal.</li>
    <li> I found it irritated the under-arm area and was sore. Wish it came with a trimmer. I do like that it&#x27;s washable.</li>
    <li> I like that razor. I use it once a day. I have batteries of 100 AA alkalines for $20.00 from Lowes, their generic brand and I think their great. Razor after probably after third week is still on same 2 batteries but getting ready for change. I don&#x27;t believe it to be closest shave but easier on skin and I need a blade to get missed hairs on neck as always. Iv&#x27;e never tried it wet shave so can&#x27;t say, like who has time for that?</li>
    <li> Great for travel. Use battery so don&#x27;t have to bring the charger along. More powerful than my Philipe.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK for what it&#x27;s advertized as a quick touch up shave. Shave is kind of close good for an end of the day meeting clean up shave.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and product feels good to hold and use but the close shave just isn&#x27;t there. It would be good for those days when before you leave well the you know what hits the fan and you must shave in the car on the way to work.</li>
    <li> Vibrates a lot and cut less than a similar battery operated three heads rotating that cost me only 8 dollars in a General Dollar store. Any way it looks solid and maybe will have a long life.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver almost every morning for almost a year and it has not given me any problems, after 10 months it seems the foil is giving up on me so it&#x27;s time to replace the the whole thing rather than just the foil itself.  Bang for the buck is there.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work, doesn&#x27;t give a clean cut! Totally regret buying it leaves behind hair look like you didn&#x27;t even attempt to shave</li>
    <li> This is terrible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously every rating that is high&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a writer that&#x27;s higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would do better removing hair with a pair of tweezers than this BS.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the intention of using only for travel. I like it so much that I now decided to use it for every day service (edging out a three-head rotary Philips-Norelco AT811 which I still like and use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I like about it? Briefly, it&#x27;s fast for my beard (5 minutes and I&#x27;m good-to-go). It leaves me with a smooth face on-par with a manual blade shave (is it really only a single-head?). It has a nice feel for my hands (I feel like I want to pick it up all the time). The charge with 2450 mAh rechargeable batteries lasts forever (OK, not literally forever, but as of today I was still on the initial charge and I can&#x27;t remember when I bought it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a brilliant move on the part of Panasonic engineers to use a high-efficiency single blade design. There is a minimum power draw from the single head, leaving plenty of juice for cutting the hair and a long service cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job, Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Literally burns the area you shave, doesn&#x27;t cut properly, takes forever DONT BUY THIS. It&#x27;s not worth the money. I rather buy countless disposable shavers than this one. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought this Pro-Curve Single Blade Wet/Dry&lt;br /&gt;for my own use because my eyesight in the&lt;br /&gt;shower is very poor.  I fell in love with this little&lt;br /&gt;razor immediately.  My old one was very&lt;br /&gt;clunky, heavier, and just too big.  This one is&lt;br /&gt;small, light-weight, quiet, gentle, and super&lt;br /&gt;efficient.  I can even get the hairs on my&lt;br /&gt;chin with it!  It is also very gentle to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it dry to shave and wet it to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other night we were going out and my&lt;br /&gt;husband needed to shave first.  He has two&lt;br /&gt;electric razors already that he doesn&#x27;t use,&lt;br /&gt;so I suggested that he try mine anyway as&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so much quicker than lathering and razor&lt;br /&gt;shaving when we are in a hurry to leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He begrudgingly tried the my little Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;and said, \\&quot;Why don&#x27;t my razors shave like this?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, he did say that!  So, I ordered 5 more&lt;br /&gt;so we&#x27;d each have our own and for the RV as&lt;br /&gt;well.  These are the best \\&quot;electric\\&quot; razors that&lt;br /&gt;either of us have ever used.  The batteries are&lt;br /&gt;still the originals and it&#x27;s going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> perfect for my purposes.  will never understand this but buying a new unit is less expensive than replacing the blades.</li>
    <li> Incredible! I use this in the shower and sink, with or without shaving cream! Excellent for full shaves or touch-up after blade shaving.  A powerful and inexpensive tool useful in every shaving kit!</li>
    <li> Powerful and easy to carry. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Best portable electric shaver I have owned.</li>
    <li> I love this new Panasonic Single blade Travel size shaver, Its safe to use and shaves me just the way i like. Clean shaven man.</li>
    <li> This is shaver was bought for my father-in-law, he is very satisfied it, it is easy to use and easy to clean. And also efficient on shaving.  This is a nice shaver.</li>
    <li> Works well and very compact.  Great for travel!</li>
    <li> inexpensive shaver that works great. batteries last a long time for many shaving day, weeks, month.</li>
    <li> My advice?  Buy ten of them.  Keep some for backup, give some as gifts, put one in the car, and stash another in the office.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  They&#x27;re outstanding little shavers.  They shave close, they shave fast, they use regular batteries (alkaline or NiMH), they&#x27;re well built, and they&#x27;re great fun to use.  For me, it has changed a chore into a recreation.    But keep the old Norelco...just for its trimmer.</li>
    <li> Background you can skip&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy, in his late 30&#x27;s, heavy (I mean HEAVY) beard growth. By the time it hits noon, dry or wetshave, the shade starts to slowly show.&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, I suffer from THE most sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything, from upgrading my foam to ultraglide superconductor foam for inflamed skin (by Gilette) to going from 2 blades to 3 blades to 4 blades-with-lubra-wd40-strips. You get the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I learned that the very best thing to do for me was to actually do a wet shave under the steamy shower: brush my teeth while I soak under the shower and then after 2.5 minutes of brushing teeth my skin would well prepped to take sensitive skin foam and I could shave infront of my precious fog-free shower mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, gradually, as the week passed the skin around my neck would get increasingly irritated from the combination of wet shaving and stiff shirt collars and ties which I must wear for work. So I ended up NOT shaving on saturdays and sundays just to start the gradual irritation cycle all over on  Monday morning. Much to wifey&#x27;s dismay as she complained about my homeless look and expressed a deep desire not to be kissed by cactus-face Rick.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, call this facial viagra, or my salvation: I found the Panasonic ES8109 (also on Amazon). A wet(!!!!) and dry shaver that would supposedly not get my skin irritated and I could use it immersed in water.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and LOVED it. Read my Amazon review of it elsewhere. It takes about 2 to 3 weeks to get used to but once you have got it down, being a shower shaver like myself, you will find it competes with the best of the Mach III or IV or Final Episode... the thing works.&lt;br /&gt;And instead of using foam with it I found that spraying on Lectric Shave with a little 1$ spray bottle COMPLETELY removed any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my shave would hold as long as the manual shave did and in the end this turned out much cheaper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the actual item listed here: ES3831K&lt;br /&gt;When I travelled for work I now wanted to have my ES8109 with me and did so a few times but it really is not a travelling shaver. It was too heavy/bulky and I needed to unplug power cables etc. and sometimes the button would get accidentally pressed and my shaver would be empty. Anyhoo, not a good travelling companion.&lt;br /&gt;I knew I wanted a wet/dry electric and I already knew the more expensive 8109 workes magic. So I bounght this one, on a whim, during a sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it with Lectric Shave in the shower it does a great job of getting me de-stubbled. It is really good and certainly not a 10$ shaver: the shave is smooth and the blades are sharp and seem to stay sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 3 Panasonic Traveling wet / dry battery shavers use the same head and replacement parts. The white one, though, has a trimmer (don&#x27;t need that on a trip!) and the bigger black one is rechargable. But they have the same shaving hardware. I wanted one where I could rreplace / bring batteries separate and did not need a trimmer. I also did not want to carry any extra cables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;I guess I talk too much (its getting late here). The shaver is great travel value. Buy this as a companion to the best electric wet shaver I could recommend , the ES8109 (for an electric best dry shave go for the Braun) but again: you have to be a shower-shaver with extra sensitive skin and heavy beard growth to appreciate my recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck in finding your own personal shaving ritual.

    <li> Razor works well - fast and efficient .  The only think missing is a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great little travel shaver that provides a close shave.  I really was surprised at how nice, clean and easy the shave was.  Not a daily driver though, I don&#x27;t think will hold up under daily use.  However, excellent for travel, keeping in your vehicle, or in your desk drawer at work for those after work daliences.  I would expect to pay 3 times as much.  Note that AA batteries provide more power than rechargeable batteries and thus better performance.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THIS SHAVER. IT IS A WET/DRY SHAVER AND IT WORKS BEST AND IS MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE USING IT AS A WET SHAVER. I FOUND THE SHAVER TO BE POWERFUL AND GIVES A CLOSE SHAVE FOR A COMPACT TRAVEL RAZOR THAT WORKS ON 2AA BATTERIES. THERE IS NO DOWNSIDE TO THIS SHAVER. I HAVE OWNED OTHER TRAVE SHAVERS(BRAUN ETC.) AND THIS ONE IS THE BEST.</li>
    <li> So for the first time you use it, try it dry and don&#x27;t let your hair grow more than 1/4 of an inch, otherwise you&#x27;ll need a regular razor to \\&quot;chop down the forest\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor isn&#x27;t designed to trim longer hair, but to maintain shorter, stubby hairs in a very easy and quick shave!! Girls.. you can use this, too!! Plus the fact that you can use it both IN &amp; OUT of the shower/water... makes this even better!! Just give it a try, the price is worth it. Also, give it a few days of using it regularly and you&#x27;ll see an improvement as you use it!! ULTRASOFT AND SILKY SKIN the more you use it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent portable small shaver ! Uses 2 AA batteries that seem to last forever. Perfect for travel without the cords and chargers !</li>
    <li> I replaced a 15 year-old version of this same shaver with this one, and as good as the last one was, this is better.  This is also so good I use it rather than my more expensive (10 times the price I paid for this one) Panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> A very nice battery powered shaver. 2 AA batteries and off you go. Not a vibration free design, good vibrations felt in your hand while using this, but it shaves close and that is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Best travel shaver I have used after using three of the others. It works best as a wet shave but as good or better than other travel shavers when dry.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver was absolutely terrible it was like shaving with a lawn mower the irritation on my neck was so bad i throw it out don&#x27;t wast your money.</li>
    <li> Works great, lives in my shaving kit. A bargain. Won&#x27;t replace my high end wet/dry but superior for travel or handy if I forget to charge my daily razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a travel razor. Works as advertised. Not as good as my daily norelco, but does the job. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Im a black guy so if my facial hair gets too long I develope hair bumps. For all that dont know, since our hair grows curley, it pokes our face and produces bumps. I use this in between my straight razor shaves. Get it and keep it in ur glove box, shave on the go.</li>
    <li> I use it when I travel. Much handier than my Norelco. Batteries last long. Quality is good. Only thing missing is a pouch.</li>
    <li> The Shavers (we ordered 2) arrived in time.  The unit is well-made, ergonomic, and appears sturdy.  It is NOT rechargeable and runs off of 2 AA batteries.  I do not have any idea about how many runs can be had with one set of Kirkland (Costco brand) batteries.  It may be possible to use rechargeable batteries should anyone choose to go that route.  This is the first time I am using an electric shaver and the initial experience is mixed!  I realize that I have to be patient and I am really not blaming it on the razor.  I should add here that shaving wet seems to be the way to go.  I have tried dry as well and it really irritated my skin.  Cleaning the shaver becomes easy with water and that&#x27;s a plus.  Please do read the other reviews by folks with more experience with electric razors before choosing an unit.</li>
    <li> For a budget foil shaver its okay.  I was hoping it cut more but it doesn&#x27;t.  At least for me it doesn&#x27;t.  If it would have had another row of shavers maybe 5 stars.  BUt I still have to go back and use my blade to get the stuck hairs under my chin and neck.  Try it- it might work for you.</li>
    <li> Small but sturdy in your hand, excellent price, great shave, needs only two AA batteries, fits easily into travel case.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble, simple to operate and highly effective shaving, my husband and his friend call the Panasonic ES3831K the best razor of this type they have used - and they&#x27;ve tried quite a few. Used the razor on the same batteries for four months whereas they usually last four weeks in other razors. Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> good product, works real good. I like it</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a good shaver.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between shaving wet and dry with this Panasonic, which I think says more negative things about its wet performance than positives about dry shaving.  It definitely will not cut long, softer hairs that crop up-- stubble only.  It tends to get hot when you use it without water, which is to be expected, but it never gets painful or concerning.  I have a few moles on my face that would frequently get cut when I used a conventional disposable razor, and this electric has solved that problem.  The shave is not as close, but it&#x27;s faster and easier, which counts for a lot when I get up 10 minutes before class and need a quick clean-up.  For the price, I would say go for it.  You won&#x27;t be blown away, but it will do the deed.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few weeks now and am quite happy with it. The batteries last forever and it really seems to clear off even a few days growth of facial hair pretty efficiently. I love that it works wet and dry. It will give you some razor burn for a few weeks until your skin gets used to it. But overall I highly recommend this razor. I just use this regularly and have saved myself a ton of money on disposable blades. Shoot this things costs less than most replacement packages.</li>
    <li> Does everything it is suppose to do. Easy to use, light weight, and you can take it everywhere.Very nice for the money.</li>
    <li> good product, but not for large hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Great bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> As a travel journalist I&#x27;m &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; a lot,&amp;#34; and sometimes find I need a little &amp;#34;shave up&amp;#34; of stubble or whatever, and this is perfect to do that and give me he clean, extra smooth feeling needed. After you insert the 2 batteries, the power seems like that of the Hoover Dam!!! Well of course I exaggerate there, but it is awesome. Amazon should sell these so fast they are all gone within seconds. And such a low, VERY low price. How do they do it??? In one word this is EXTRAORDINARY.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazingly strong and smooth on my face! I&#x27;ve used a blade for years, but decided to give this a shot as it was battery operated and could be used in the car or office for a quick touch-up during the day. It is so simple that I now use it exclusively and even bought another one to keep in my glove box because at this price, why not??</li>
    <li> Does it shave as close as a blade? Well, no. But I have yet to find any electric razor that does. What this little gem DOES do is give me a quick 2-minute tune-up on those &#x27;tweener days when you want to forego the blade shave ritual. At this task, it excels. Probably 90% of a blade shave at the push of the On button. The 2 AA batteries last and last and last. Going on 6 weeks now, and no evidence of slow-down. The size is perfect, the cutting action smooth, and the shape fits nicely in the hand. For 11 bucks, an incredible bargain.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the times you on the road</li>
    <li> Very good. The only cons are the cover and the brush are not attached to the razor..will go missing for sure.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really get the job done. Takes a while to get a nice trim but there&#x27;s always hair left.</li>
    <li> Great shave at a great price.  Cleaning is a cinch.  Uses 2 AA batteries which last for several weeks of daily use.</li>
    <li> Panasonic ES3831K. First, when I bought it I thought would be to cheep to using it. When I get it, I fall in love and bought second one right away ( in case of something happen ). After one year it happen - fall on hard floor.  I am still happy with second one. Not wait, buy two of them. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I see I need to add something. For last 8 years I&#x27;ve been using different brand electric shaver, some of them for more than $100. This one is best for wet-shave. If you know better one let me know.</li>
    <li> If I put new batteries in and then leave it for a few days, the batteries will be completely dead when I try to use it next. If not for that, it would be fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned battery powered razors for many years, a Sanyo and a Braun, and loved them both.  I like this one better than the others I&#x27;ve had because it&#x27;s more &#x27;ergonomic&#x27; (easy to hold) and has a much larger cutting screen area.</li>
    <li> Good size and comfortable to handle. It is perfect for travel and use in the plane or waiting room. It is hard to fine one like it.</li>
    <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t beat this shaver.  Works as well as my $60 shaver.  Runs on AA&#x27;s which are readily available anywhere.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son. Looks great. But if the facial hair is long, it won&#x27;t work. Otherwise it is fine.</li>
    <li> You,yes YOU.&lt;br /&gt;If you get a chance to go camping or go off the beatin track or even for everyday use at home, this will work as good if not better than your 150.00 dollar electric shaver...for less than the cost of those fancy 5 blade refill packs. I use to have a smaller one years ago and found this one. I ♥ how you clean it with just liquid hand soap and it&#x27;s ready to shave just like new. No gimmick&#x27;s or magic mirrors. This does it wet or dry and if you know how to shave and move your skin it will make it as smooth if not smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom. It takes alkaline batteries and lasts a while. What else can I say...I ♥ it !!!</li>
    <li> For it&#x27;s purpose as a travel shaver it is excellent. The shave is much better than you might expect and comfortable too. It&#x27;s fairly small and light and will shave for many days on the batteries. It does not have a trimmer if that is important to you.</li>
    <li> Excellent little shaver, fits right into your hand, packs away anywhere in your toiletry kit.  I own three, one in each bathroom and one for my travel kit.  Pack a set of extra batteries when you travel.  One set will last one to two weeks, depending on length of each shave.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it under the shower, the water proofing is iffy.  Nevertheless, get one or two, your beard will thank you!</li>
    <li> I have owned several electric shavers over the decades, a couple costing much more than the Panasonic 3831. Without doubt, this is the best of them all.  It is well built.  It cuts very close for an electric.  It is easy to clean.  You can use it in the shower, or dry.  It works best with fresh batteries, and I use rechargeables.  It may become your main tool for shaving, even if you have been using the Mach III Turbo.  That is how good it is.  My 3831 is over three years old, used daily, and it is still running just fine.  I think you will be happy with both the cost of the shaver and how well it work.  *Update. It&#x27;s been six years now since I bought this Panasonic ES3831K, and I&#x27;m astonished at how well this electric razor has held up to time and heavy use. I&#x27;ve owned several electric razors over the past 40+ years, and this one is by far the most reliable and best. I&#x27;m sure part of this has to do with maintenance, which every mechanical device needs. The only thing I&#x27;ve done is make sure the blades are clean, wiping them out with a toothbrush every couple months. I also add a half drop of oil every six months. That&#x27;s not much, It won&#x27;t cost you much money to determine yourself if I am correct.</li>
    <li> It gives a pretty good shave and it&#x27;s getting better as my whiskers adjust to it. I&#x27;ve had it almost a week. I have a beard so I&#x27;ve been using it only on my neck... that&#x27;s where I have the hardest time getting a good shave and I usually get irritation.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like my last electric shaver. I&#x27;ve never used it in the shower, so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I prefer to shave dry, before I shower. I like the fact that it takes AA batteries instead of being rechargeable. It&#x27;s small enough to be a good travel razor.  The cover doesn&#x27;t stay on very well in my travel bag so it&#x27;s not as convenient as another brand with the attached swivel cover but that is not as important as the performance in my opinion. Don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but it seems pretty solid. I recommend this razor. I&#x27;m glad I got it. It was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Within five minutes after putting the batteries in (doesn&#x27;t come with any so have two AA alkalines on hand), I was impressed. This little wonder did a good a good job of cleaning off my two day old growth. I&#x27;ve used a razor all my life and though this shaver doesn&#x27;t quite give the razor quality, it sure is close. I can shave while watching TV. Once my face gets used to it like the insert says (to give it 30 days), I&#x27;ll update this post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it&#x27;s cheaper to buy the shaver individually than buying the razor and foil replacements.</li>
    <li> This shaver feels powerful. It cuts very close to skin compared to those 3 head shavers. Downside of this shaver is trying to get the angled areas under your neck. The AA batteries are a nice touch, since I hate throwing out shavers when the ion batteries die. For the price, this thing is perfect.</li>
    <li> I give this five stars because it works better than expected. Had used a Remington Traveler, (ocassionally), for several years and really liked it, but like this Panasonic much better and use it every day. Love the fact that it uses 2 AA batteries and they will last 2 weeks or more. I was surprised at the quality of this shaver at such a low price !!</li>
    <li> looks good its a good shaver i tried it when i got here and i liked it i travel alot and it bin working out fine.. i like it so far thanks and the shipping was fast too.thanks</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd purchase of this model. Prior to that I was a Braun loyalist. On a trip I forgot my Braun and bought this Panasonic Model.  It provides an excellent shave and is very reasonably priced.  This is one of the best values on the market,</li>
    <li> i purchased this razor because i had owned the same one before it was delivered very quickly and have had no problems with it</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and other reviewers rated it well so I thought I would go for it. I&#x27;m glad I did! Compact, small size makes traveling a breeze. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This shaver is good for the money.  I don&#x27;t shave often in the winter and it didn&#x27;t do well with my longer hairs (I know thats gross lol) but after I tried shaving dry, I tried shaving wet in the shower and it works pretty good.  I hope that with my leg hairs shorter that this will be good for keeping them shaved.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a close shave and doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair. It also agitates my face... You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> compact and handy, with the replaceable batteries, you don&#x27;t have to worry about when travel, shaving could be better, but it is acceptable to me, for $14.00, it is is a good deal</li>
    <li> If you want a cheap electric shaver, this is a good choice. It does as good a job as I expect an electric to do, and you don&#x27;t need to plug it in.</li>
    <li> When I travel, especially overseas, I always take this shaver.  It&#x27;s small and I don&#x27;t need to worry recharging or bringing a plug adapter.  Shaves just as close as my regular home electric shaver.  One down side, however, it doesn&#x27;t have a pop-up trimmer.  I had a older version of this shaver which had the extra function and I finally wore out the blades and foil.  My solution was simple: I put the new foil and blade on my old shaver...it was cheaper than purchasing a foil and blade kit.  One other reminder...take out the batteries before you travel.  It could turn on in your luggage :)</li>
    <li> Does a great job and lasts!  Batteries last long too.  I have used these for years.  I keep a couple of new ones on hand</li>
    <li> Stronger and shaves faster than the Braun Pocket Shaver.  Also cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish it has is the capability to be plugged in to an AC outlet.  But it is the same issue with other travel shavers, too.</li>
    <li> awesome little machine!!</li>
    <li> Loved it. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> No it&#x27;s bad. I thought it shaves but it doesn&#x27;t properly lol waste stupid ppl why giving 5 ***** haha...</li>
    <li> My facial trimmer broke so I bought this as a last minute resort, and it barely shaved any hairs off my face. I tried it with water, without water, with shaving cream, nothing. It didn&#x27;t do its job at all. Waste of 10 dollars. I was very disappointed. I hope I received a bad unit.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take off any hair a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Bought three. After I bought the fist one I bought two more just incase I could not find in the future. I use for lip and chin shave so not to cut my face with razor and it works great with shaving cream or in the shower.</li>
    <li> give to my husband, he travel a lot&lt;br /&gt;he really like it, just use a good batteries and reary to go</li>
    <li> compact, comfortable to shave, inexpensive.  What else can you ask for?  Love it.</li>
    <li> Always happy with every Panasonic purchase made, this is no different. works great for quick &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; time quick shave. my husband likes it for camping and it is small enough to pack up with out being bulky. does the job he says ! it will be good for vacations this summer. light and compact size. would buy again.</li>
    <li> The fact that it works is ok however it does not shave like I want not sharp</li>
    <li> The shaver, if you buy a couple and get free shipping from Amazon, is cheaper than buying the replacement foil alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well on short stubble, not for use if you&#x27;re going to go several days without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy at about $17.  Alkaline AA Batteries last me a good long time.</li>
    <li> WHAT A SURPRISE THIS WAS,HAVE HAD IT FOR ONE MONTH THIS THING IS STILL SHAVING ON ORIGINAL BATTERIES BUT THAT&#x27;S NOT THE BEST PART THIS SHAVES AS CLOSE SMOOTH AS ANY RAZOR I OWN [and I have 6 others] THE PRICE HAD ME FOOLED I DIDN&#x27;T&lt;br /&gt;THINK IT COULD BE THIS GOOD!  HAT&#x27;S OFF TO PANASONIC!</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor. The price for a travel razor is great.</li>
    <li> very good shaving results for a lot less money</li>
    <li> The perfect travel shaver. I can get a smooth shave using replaceable batteries.</li>
    <li> Really nice razor for the price, gives a good close shave without irritation, long battery life, and small enough to toss in travel bag.</li>
    <li> This travel really does a good job for sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t use it just as travel shaver, I use it as my regular shaver. It works just that well. For the price you just can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I owned. Both already last more than a year and a half. asdas asd asd</li>
    <li> I tried this razor when I saw the price for replacement cutters and foils for my $280.00 Braun.  It shaves closer than the Braun, so I bought four(4) of them.  I won&#x27;t need cutters and foils for a long time.  Also I was afraid the razors would disappear from the marketplace.  Not to worry, though, because Amazon will always carry the best for less.[[ASIN:B001CS8BJ6 Panasonic ES3831K Single Blade Travel Shaver, Black]]</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my father and he really likes the shaver.  He had one prior to this and it had last him for years.  So I purchased another one and hope this one will last for years also.</li>
    <li> works well for me. doesnt work well for my brother though. if you dont have a lot of facial hair then it should be fine.</li>
    <li> It is not very good product but it doesn&#x27;t cut the face hair. It is comfort because it is small that you put in the pocket.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for three months.  I use it every day as a trimmer around my mustache and upper face (I wear glasses so I do that so I can see when I get serious with my Panasonic rechargeable shaver).  I have also used it on several occasions to do the entire job.  It does an excellent job, as good, I think, as my \\&quot;high dollar\\&quot; Panasonic rechargeable, which is more than surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the same batteries in the shaver (DuraCell) since I got it.  I could not believe that after 90 days they hadn&#x27;t gone flat.  I checked them with a very reliable battery tester and found them to be nearly fully charged!  Unbelievable!!!  The batteries in the shaver that I used for my trimming process before this one might last two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY impressed with this little cheapie.  Serious bang for very little buck.</li>
    <li> For the money i think it&#x27;s worth it. If you have little facial hair it will work good</li>
    <li> Shaves cleanly and far better than the [[ASIN:B002TQ4AO0 Braun M90]] which is similarly listed on Amazon and oft compared to this product.    Unlike the Braun when removing the foil the inside is flat making it easier to brush out the cuttings.    Comparable shave to the Panasonic ES-RS10 (sold only in Asian countries) made in Japan (and also the [[ASIN:B005IUR9CE ES-RS10-S]] which is identical except that it is in Japanese) although the ES-RS10 is not a wet/dry shaver and the ES-RS10 comes with a superior cleaning brush which is larger. The tiny cleaning brush that comes with the ES3831K may get lost. Not sure if replacements are available. The Braun has a clear advantage on this issue compared to this model because the cleaning brush fits into the bottom of the shaver.    The higher model [[ASIN:B001CS2JEO ES-3833]] (not sure if it is sold in North America) has a trimmer and a hard travel case. It is otherwise very similar and also a similar size to this shaver and shaves identically.</li>
    <li> So you can&#x27;t beat the price and it shaves as good or better than any other shaver I have purchased.  After years of electric razors, I find that the single blade shavers (which are the cheapest) shave the best on your chin/jaw line.  This razor is no exception.  Most days I shave with a razor, but don&#x27;t go \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;, and then use this to finish the job.  That way you get the very close shave without the skin irritation of razor shaving \\&quot;against the grain.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only flaw is you have to use two AA batteries.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I ever use and I use a lot. The wet and dry feature is a huge plus in my book</li>
    <li> This is a good, inexpensive shaver.  I enjoy using it every day.  I bought it for travel, but now use it daily.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of $15 electric shaver, but it does a really decent job if you are on the go and have no other options available.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves it said it doesnt leave hair stubs. gotta get AA batteries for it though. other than that its great</li>
    <li> I like it but wish it had the pop up trimmer like my old one which is no longer available. (In the US) This is probably the greatest travel razor ever made although I use it everyday,</li>
    <li> This Razor was purchased as a Christmas gift for our 12 year old son who was excited to have his first stubble in need of a shave.  I was delighted and saddened to watch my husband (for the last time, as this is our youngest son) teach him to shave using a standard razor and shaving cream.  It is right of passage in our house and I have to admit to crying this time around.  However, for a 12 year old to keep up with a shaving the old-fashion way was a little much to ask so in order to keep him well groomed, we decided to purchase a small electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor was an ideal choice.  It was small, easy to handle, light on batteries, and easy to clean.  To top it off, it was hypoallergenic with no Nickel content.  This was important for us since our son is highly allergic to Cobalt which is very high in Nickel.  I&#x27;m not sure if you had a really heavy beard if this is the razor for you but if you have a light beard or &#x27;starter&#x27; stubble, this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> Could be better, but does the job as a travel razor on the go.  I take it on week long trips for business travel and use it every day to shave.  Battery only last about 5days with average growth of facial hair.  If your looking for small portable shaver to utilize on the road get this one.  I would not recommend this for daily home use, does not have the power and you would waste a lot of batteries.  Quick rinse under water after every shave allows for good shave everyday.  3 stars only because it does not have built in trimmer.</li>
    <li> This travel razor is okay, but not the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Worth the price if you&#x27;re not expecting too aweful much out of it.</li>
    <li> good to use, but dont press it too hard or it might bruise your skin.</li>
    <li> This thing is one of the best value items I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It&#x27;s made well enough to do a good job and made solid enough that it lasts if you don&#x27;t beat it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned 4 or 5 of them now, and I use it to shave everyday.  Every once in a while I&#x27;ll drop it onto the tile floor, it&#x27;ll break, and I&#x27;ll order another one because it&#x27;s cheap enough that I don&#x27;t care about the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Worked great for about 6 months, then the mesh top got a hole in it which basically killed the ability to shave correctly. Probably something I did myself, not a fault of the manufacture. Better suited for close shaves in the mustache and right under your lower lip areas. Need multiple passs for semi-close shave on rest of face, at which point you might as well use a regular razor for 5-min.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver!!! Small and compact. Great clean shave. Very happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> this shipping was great, but im not here to talk about that. the shaver itself sucks, a lot. it wont cut any hair whatsoever. it wont even cut small scruff. all it does is glide around your face...</li>
    <li> This little shaver far exceeded my expectations.  It shaves faster and closer than it&#x27;s big brother Panasonic I use daily.  I almost believe that the manufacturer is dumping this model because it is too good at the price.  I use it wet with a little liquid soap.  That will work really well when I use for travel.</li>
    <li> excellent. been using for about five years now. have had zero problems, easy to clean, water-cleanable, and very smooth shaving capabilities!</li>
    <li> Since this is my first electric, I am giving it five stars.  It works great! I so wish I had purchased I one sooner,and I now want a higher-model.</li>
    <li> Works great as a light shave in a hurry but obviously don&#x27;t expect it to tame your willy beard. It&#x27;s moderately water resistant although don&#x27;t test it. I just mean i&#x27;ve gotten it wet a couple times and it&#x27;s fine. Fits nice and tight and easy to change out filter would get again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the price and size fool you, this is a pretty darn good shaver for $12. It works as well as my &amp;#34;low-end&amp;#34; Braun shaver, and that&#x27;s saying a lot. The only thing it&#x27;s lacking is a long hair trimmer but I&#x27;m OK with that.</li>
    <li> this is sick great for everyone thick or thin beared</li>
    <li> very good, excellente</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this shaver 5 stars based on it being an inexpensive travel shaver, not a high-end-shaver.  I also have no other shaver to compare it to.  I purchased this as an introduction to dry shaving after scraping my face with a razor blade for decades.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money only to find out I didn&#x27;t like dry shaving.  After several uses I am very pleased with its performance.  I have course facial hair and although this did not give me a shave as close as I can get with a razor blade, it does provide a shave that is perfectly suitable if I&#x27;m not preparing for a special event.  It takes longer than shaving with a razor blade but the trade off is I have no pulling pain with this shaver and no razor burn.  It is a perfect size for traveling.  This shaver has a nice feel - not too heavy and not too light.  However, I would have gladly paid an extra nickel to get a brush that was adequate.  The one supplied is utterly pathetic, measuring 1 and 1/4 inches long, including the bristles on each end.  The part you hold is only 5/8 inch long.  Very short-sighted decision by the manufacturer to not supply an adequate brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used, and owned, a ton of electric shavers of all types and prices, and this is easily one of my favorites. I prefer it to several substantially more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other cheap electric shavers, both rechargeable and not, this blows away the competition. There is no shaver, at least none that I&#x27;ve found, that compares to this one for less than $100. The only razors I prefer to this are my Braun Series 7 (which costs in excess of $200) and a similarly expensive high end Philips Norelco. Replacement razor heads for both of those cost more than twice as much as this travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I&#x27;ve used this, it gives a good shave, and does so quickly. The two AA batteries keep it running for days, months even - far longer than I originally expected, at least. I&#x27;ve used it both dry and wet, and it&#x27;s worked great in both scenarios.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I&#x27;ve ever had with this is that the foil does eventually give out - something true of any foil shaver. However, unlike the more expensive options, this shaver is actually cheaper than the replacement parts - it&#x27;s cheaper to replace the whole thing than just the foil (which is precisely what I did - I&#x27;m about to buy this shaver for the third time since ~2010). I don&#x27;t really see how I can hold the incredibly low price against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, and will, be buying this again. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap, versatile travel shaver... or even if price doesn&#x27;t matter much to you, this is what you want.</li>
    <li> This shaver does what it is supposed to, and is a pleasure to use. While it is a little tricky to put the batteries, it is surely worthwhile to keep at it.</li>
    <li> 09/2013 UPDATE.&lt;br /&gt;After I bought this shaver I had take it three times on traveling, the first two of a few days only, I will mention first that the item was not abused at all, it was stored in a protective toiletry bag, with its plastic cap on. and this is what happened:  my third trip was going to be of 9 days as opposed as 4 &amp; 5 days of the previous outtings, I had use it a couple of times before, maybe two or three times per trip (say 5-6 times total), took it with me again, used it a 6th time, then a 7th, I felt it particularly irritating, I thought that my skin was sensitive so I kept on shaving (no mirror), I agree with the reviews that this needs a few passes before it works and so I did, except taht the irritation became pain, so it was pretty odd to me, I looked for the mirror and looked at myself and one of the metal wires of the head was loose, so basically I had a loose thin sharp piece of metal scratching me over and over again, I had marks of the scratches in my face, and the redness of the skin being torn by this metal.  I am not happy with that, I dont even have thick facial hair, so couldnt have broke because of that, is is plain and simple hazardous cheap material, so the $16.00 wonder turned into an over $2.00 a shave, but most annoying, to have my facial skin left with red marks of scratches due to the crappy quality of the materials.  I hated it, I tossed it away, even the mechanism still worked, but I will not risk to another injury. (try to switch to a regular razor blade after having the skin scratched all over), shaving for the rest of my trip became literally, a pain (where I could).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to some traveling that I do, I really needed a portable shaver, usually the electric shaver I use at home was too bulky and heavy when you have some space restrictions in your luggage, and I cannot use the regular shavers due to the breakouts in my skin, so I needed an electric shaver easy to carry, use and wash, this one is easier to carry and avoids me to carry another charger, it is really convenient at a very affordable price, it also works either dry or wet, perfect.  The only con that I found is that at first it seems not to work very well, needed several passes before cutting, however once your facial hair starts getting adapted it starts to work better, it is a travel portable device, so dont expect to have a baby face shave, but for the convenience and the value I would definitely recommend it if willing to give it a bit of time for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way in addition to the item, the delivery service was really good.  Amazon shipped it really timely which I appreciated.</li>
    <li> Very handy little shaver. It&#x27;s light and portable (no cord) and seems to have good battery life. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it can miss occasional beard hairs and it needs to be cleaned often to be most effective. But for the price, it is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> This thing is great, works in water, works when dry ( recommend the latter for shaving).  with proper care and maintenance it will last forever, and yes parts are available to replace as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;comes in plastic, but with instructions and everything you need for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Feels solid and has some weight to it. It doesn&#x27;t shave close enough for me but it&#x27;s good in a pinch. Small but feels good in the hand.</li>
    <li> Bought it after reading many favorable reviews. My experience with this was that it does a good job if you maintain a almost clean shaven look and shave stubble. If you have hair longer than 2mm, they will not go into the foil and repeated use doesnt help.</li>
    <li> I was skeptic at first, but got very amazed by the closeness! It also has got an excellent grip. Recommendable 100% to anyone! It&#x27;s got literally an \\&quot;edge\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The top plastic piece that holds the foil cracked off - very cheap and fragile.  Tried to order a new part (&amp;#34;Foil Frame&amp;#34;).  Not available.  Had to reach for the duct tape.  Nice.</li>
    <li> good for quick, travel, and everyday if you&#x27;re not crazy hairy. Takes x2 AA&#x27;s, lasts quite a bit, don&#x27;t remember last time i changed the batteries.</li>
    <li> Traveling here we come!  Use anywhere...camping or hotel!</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews I ordered this shaver in before a trip to Indonesia.  Based on size I figured it would be great as a compact travel shaver.  However, upon my first shaving experience I&#x27;m left with a patchy, disgruntled looking beard.  Buyers must take consideration of their own facial hair types before purchasing this shaver.  Myself, I have thick facial hair.  Anything over 3 days growth for me is too much for this razor.  I&#x27;m left with tiny patches of hair on my upper lip and sides of my face that the shaver just can not cut.  The hair growing under my chin and around my neck is untouched by this razor leaving me with an awkward looking neck beard that won&#x27;t go away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and consider a different travel shaver.  The only reason I gave this shaver any stars at all is the fact you can wash it under running water with soap and it&#x27;s compact size.  As far a shaver goes I might as well be using a butter-knife.</li>
    <li> MY 93 YEAR OLD FATHER NEEDED THIS. HE CAN HARDLY SEE TO DEAL WITH PLUG INS AND UNDERSTAND CHARGING SO I THOUGHT THIS WOULD DO THE JOB. HE LOVES IT. WORKS GREAT FOR HIS NEEDS.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, trims pretty close for an electric, though tends to stall a bit in heavy beard - still manages to get the job done. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend as an only razor, but great to touch-up before dinner on the road or when you don&#x27;t have time or inclination to go the full water, foam and blade routine.</li>
    <li> This a great shaver to pack for traveling.  It runs on regular batteries, it&#x27;s light and easy to pack.  I have been using it for a number of trips and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> The best money I think i&#x27;ve spent.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is small &amp; really efficient &amp; the shave is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this to shave my head only. Fast close cut. Powerful motor and relatively quiet. Works great in the shower also. Extremely easy to clean.</li>
    <li> i like this so much that I tried to buy a second one. I use it for the hair that still grows on my head and have no intention of trying it on my face. But it gets close, works quickly, and the batteries last a couple months. Well worth the low price.</li>
    <li> I use it between shaves with razor.&lt;br /&gt;I use it wet never dry.&lt;br /&gt;It easy to clean and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel and quick touch ups..</li>
    <li> Long battery life, does a very nice job.  Almost as good as a twin blade.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that it is wet/dry and uses  2 AA batteries.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The manual advises not to use rechargable batteries, they say they may leak, I&#x27;ve never seen a NiMH battery leak, but seen a lot on no rechargeable batteries leak.&lt;br /&gt;-Not good for curved areas like the neck.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very good for flat areas since it is a big and fast single blade.</li>
    <li> I had an old Braun single blade which was perfect for my uses- mainly shaving my neck area, and back of neck. After the last time I dropped it, it stopped taking a charge- wouldn&#x27;t even illuminate the little charge button. I bought a Remington dual blade with a pivoting head. It actually worked fine, but I found the pivoting head/dual blade seemed to just make it take longer. Sold it to a friend. Back to the drawing board. There aren&#x27;t too many single blade non pivoting shavers out there. I really didn&#x27;t have alot of faith in getting a battery operated shaver, but the reviews here were pretty good, and the price was right, so I took a chance. Glad I did. Amazing amount of power coming out of this thing. Actually is maybe a centimeter wider than my old shaver too, which is great. It shaves just as good as any other shaver- there is no compromise here. Pretty comfortable to hold/use/maneuver around the neck. I use rechargeable batteries, so I am always gonna have fresh power. The other good thing is not worrying about the potential of battery death with your typical rechargeable shaver- though I am not sure anyone really worries about that..haha. For this price you can afford to buy a backup for when the blades eventually wear down. As inoften as I use it (once a week) this might just last me the rest of my life. Gulp.</li>
    <li> Ever since Braun changed their cutting foil design, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good single blade shaver.  This has become my everyday shaver now.  It is actually cheaper than buying replacement foil/cutter, so I bought 6 of them!</li>
    <li> No complaints. it is what it is.  A fairly compact, travel battery powered razor&lt;br /&gt;This little guy serves his purpose admirably</li>
    <li> Good buy for the price.  I bought this for my travel abroad.  I wanted something that would be decent in shaving and with good battery life.  Both criteria were met.  I have very thick beard so shaving is very cumbersome each morning.  This shaver did the job of taking care of my thickest hairs.  The battery stayed strong for the three weeks I was there and I&#x27;ve still been able to use the same battery for numerous overnight trips and weekends out of town months afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Although I won&#x27;t complain for the price, it would be awesome if this shaver had a wider foil to get a better shave with one try and also a mini trimmer.  But aside from that, good buy for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this model before and I ordered another because this is an excellent shaver.  It gives a close shave and the batteries seem to last longer in this shaver than in others that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage son who is just starting to shave.  He doesn&#x27;t need to shave daily yet, so this is perfect for him.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> Great for travel - just make sure you always have the protective cover on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the prior editions of Panasonic travel shavers ... I owned one and it was very anemic, wouldn&#x27;t shave well at all ... but this current model blows me away, it runs faster and stronger off its batteries than my Braun runs off its (both use AA&#x27;s). For that matter it runs stronger and better than my standard, home edition Braun. Let me put it up front: I&#x27;m a big Braun fan, they have served me well for years, but this inexpensive Panasonic travel sharpener is good enough, for me, for home use. It also has a great shape, great industrial design, did they hire Braun&#x27;s designer or give someone with a new way of looking at things free reign to innovate?  &#x27;cause this is amazingly good looking and strong performing, shocking at $15 (batteries not included!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses and minuses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Produces high RPM from fresh AA&#x27;s. (I will add an update when I have used this for a couple of weeks, how long it takes to decline and what it&#x27;s like towards the end.) Since this is a pretty good shaver, I may try Lithium AA&#x27;s which are actually cheaper than the more traditional alkalines, if you look at total power available vs. cost (although the initial cost is quite higher). Note that Lithiums have a very steep power drop off - which is good - they deliver their full power and hence rpm right up until the end, then drop off quickly. So you won&#x27;t be faced with the quandary of trying to keep going on alkalines that still have enough power for a shave but not enough power for good performance. [[ASIN:B0044P3J2I Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA 12 Battery Super Pack]] Lithiums last a lot longer - up to 9x as long in the Ultimate edition - and weigh much less than alkalines which is also good if you are going on an extended trip or hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Shaves closer than either of my Brauns.&lt;br /&gt;- I haven&#x27;t had shaver burn from an electric in years - since my skin is conditioned to them. But with this one shaving closer, I have some shaver burn spots now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Shaves close enough that I could, in a pinch, get away without my normal \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; shave with a blade in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s still not as close as a good blade with careful work, but it will certainly pass for dinner or a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No edge trimmer. I don&#x27;t use this much, preferring to use a blade, but you need to know this.&lt;br /&gt;- Due to the lack of edge trimmer and almost all electric shavers&#x27; inability to cut down the occasional stray (longer) hair, you will need to carry a disposable blade for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Has a tiny button in the on-off slider which keeps the slider locked until you depress it. This is good for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ It is water proof so it&#x27;s harder to mess up. I don&#x27;t do wet (shower) shaving so I don&#x27;t know how well that works - I don&#x27;t like leaving the head damp. I will keep it in mind for my periodic deep cleaning though - it&#x27;s nice to know I can wash this is a bowl of soapy water and don&#x27;t have to use those old-fashioned shaver cleaner liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Nicely designed, nice fitting clip-on clear plastic shaver head cover.&lt;br /&gt;- The cover doesn&#x27;t have vent slots for drying out, an issue if you wet-shave with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- + Bigger and heavier than other travel shavers - but still MUCH lighter than a home shaver. Gram shavers need an Eltron and you can even save a couple of ounces and some space with a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- + The tiny utility brush doesn&#x27;t fit into a slot on the shaver, and my prediction is you will lose it quickly. But hey there&#x27;s always your toothbrush, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update here as necessary. It&#x27;s good enough for daily shaving so I won&#x27;t have to wait for a trip get a significant number of shaves on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: caucasian beard, lightly bearded but what I have is stubbly. Usually light to medium electric shave followed by a touch-up in the shower with a BIC single edge disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a travel shaver, but a website reviewed the top3 - Braun, Eltron and this one ([[ASIN:B002TQ4AO0 Braun Mobile Shaver - M90 1 Count]], [[ASIN:B001IDZMGK Eltron #el-3040 Compact Travel Shaver]]} - and commenters liked the Panasonic so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 17 days on my first set of AA batteries (Rayovac alkalines). August 30-Sept 15).&lt;br /&gt;Update: 17 days on my second set of AA batteries (Rayovac&#x27;s again). Sept 16-October 2. Surprisingly consistent. No more razor burn! Either the blade burnished in, or my skin toughened up.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Oct 3 to Oct 13 on third set of AA batteries (Rayovac&#x27;s again). Fewer days of life - did these batteries come out of another device, they were rattling loose in the drawer. Chalk this one up as an anomaly given the consistent performance of the first 2 sets.&lt;br /&gt;Update: October 14 until January 19 (!!! yes true) on one set of Energizer Advanced Lithium AA&#x27;s. So apparently lithium batteries do last a lot longer. That was about 97 days. So the $2 a piece cost of the battery (vs. .50 cents for alkalines) is more than recovered. The \\&quot;death spiral\\&quot; of lithiums is even more drawn out than alkalines however - it was running slow (but enough to shave) for about 10 days before they gave up the ghost.3 - Braun, Eltron and this one ([[ASIN:B002TQ4AO0 Braun Mobile Shaver - M90 1 Count]], [[ASIN:B001IDZMGK Eltron #el-3040 Compact Travel Shaver]]} - and commenters liked the Panasonic so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.

The \\&quot;death spiral\\&quot; of lithiums is even more drawn out than alkalines however - it was running slow (but enough to shave) for about 10 days before they gave up the ghost.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well so far - would be nice to have side trimmer as well but can&#x27;t complain at this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to use this thing a couple times. I&#x27;ve tried it with soap, shaving cream, and dry, and this thing cuts way to close. It literally cuts my skin to get the close shave, not what I had in mind with a day shaver.</li>
    <li> Love&#x27;em shaves my head all the way  bald in minutes.</li>
    <li> Has a VERY hard time cutting stubble down well.</li>
    <li> Quality, compared to the competition is fantastic, the only one to buy. Will be getting another for my truck.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to use on camping trips after a friend recommended it.  It&#x27;s great: gives a great shave, easy to use and to clean, powered by standard-size batteries.  I use it at home a lot now in place of a blade shaver.</li>
    <li> best performance for your money. powerful, easy to use, less power consuption&#x3D; perfect performance.recommend for everyone who wants to have clean shaves at optimum expense.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic electric shaver is without a doubt one of the best shavers that can be bought for a reasonable price.  I have not used an electric shaver in years so I forgot about how nice a quick shave without all of the hot water, shaving gel, etc. could be with the electric shaver.  I just put on some Lectric Shave to stiffen up the beard, let it dry in about 15 seconds - and then begin the great shaving.  This shaver has been very good in helping me get over a case of folliculitis in the chin area.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Nice size and shape and nicely priced.  Still wish Panasonic would bring back the similar model that had the trimmer attached (it also had a nice case that was included).  This one is fine for using at home, but the other one is much more versatile.  What gives, Panasonic?  Maybe I&#x27;ll try the small Braun shaver with the trimmer next time.</li>
    <li> This is the one! Great price and great shaver, much better than the Braun. really.</li>
    <li> It does a very good job, for being so small</li>
    <li> This product is worth buying.  Its very cheap and am happy with the result after using it. 10 Stars. Recommended...</li>
    <li> My dad has an ACV some years ago and he lost the ability to move his dominant hand, so he has trouble shaving his face, and with this shaver he is happy of the final results and it turns to be very easy to him, I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
    <li> One of the best affordable razors</li>
    <li> just as I expected and I like it totally on time I recommend this seller five star A+ if you want it get it</li>
    <li> It was a little bigger than I expected, but it works really well. I&#x27;m not sure if this works for people with thick facial hair.</li>
    <li> I have the older Panasonic rechargeable single-head shaver.  It&#x27;s the easiest to use, gives the best shave, and is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I paid less than $30 for it not too long ago and would buy another one or two now for future use, but they are no longer made and I&#x27;m not willing to pay $100 or more from an after-market seller.  I basically bought two of these shavers because the blades and screen can be removed and used for replacements on my rechargeable model.  I was going on vacation, so I figured I would pack one of these battery powered shavers just for convenience.  These are great, and give as good a shave as my original rechargeable.  The single narrow head really lets you get precise results around your mustache and tight spots.  The head is NARROW.  The shave is CLOSE.  I can&#x27;t find another shaver that is currently available which comes close to the results I get from these single, narrow head, shavers.  After two weeks of constant use, the two AA batteries were just like new.</li>
    <li> Works and tried it as soon as It was delivered&lt;br /&gt;No complaints so far</li>
    <li> this shaver is amazing...close shave....only $10......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my dad, age 91...he has a very tough beard and early alzheimers and even HE can use it easily...convenient with batteries and no charging involved.....he loves it......and so do I!</li>
    <li> It works alright if you shave every day. If you prefer to shave every few days, and you have any substantial beard growth, forget about it. It won&#x27;t catch the longer hairs. Further, I agree with some of the other reviewers who noted that this works well on the cheeks / sideburn area, but not so great on / around the chin, because it&#x27;s too round (or chiseled, in my case ;) ).</li>
    <li> It has a VERY hard time cutting through my stubble, which I don&#x27;t think is particularly thick, and if there is more than a couple days of stubble it does absolutely nothing to it. After I used it wet I found it pretty difficult to clean. A toothbrush worked pretty well but it still started to smell after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up just trashing it and buying normal razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy a lot of well rated items on Amazon, and this was the first time I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> We have purchased 4 of these. I keep one in my car (for when I forgot to shave), one for our son (who had one that broke, after using it everyday on the way to work- after two years of everday use), and another one for our other son to use when needed. For the price, I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> this is very small Blade Travel Shaver i ever buy and it s work good, i love it and am always will have it in when am traveling</li>
    <li> Got it, put batteries in, pressed button, did not work, replaced batteries, switch battery polarity, nothing, returned it , got replacement, tried once again did not work, returning it, going to try another brand.,</li>
    <li> Shaves very well for a travel size and uses 2 AA batteries that can be found anywhere.  Best for the price.</li>
    <li> tHIS WAS A GREAT BUY FOR $20.00. i DON&#x27;T NORMALLY USE AN ELECTRIC RAZOR BUT WAnted sometning inexpensive to take when I travel. This fits the bill perfectly!!</li>
    <li> I know this item is a men&#x27;s shaver, but I camp often and needed a battery operated, foil razor that had a large enough head to it.  Most ladies are very tiny or do not work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving this, it is now my main razor at home as well as camping.  It works better than a straight razor.  And I get to save on water during my shower; double bonus :)</li>
    <li> Great little shaver, I wish it had a trimmer though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very unfortunately the version with the trimmer is currently not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this little shaver is a great travel companion. Takes up very little space, you don&#x27;t have to worry about carrying a charger.</li>
    <li> My dad needed a new battery operated razor, so I searched and researched and opted for this one. As my Braun was in need of a new cutter and foil at about $35, I decided to get one for myself. This little razor is as good if not better than the Braun. As in previous posts, will not cut longer hair and has no trimmer, but the shave is very close. The first couple of days there was a little irritation, but no more a couple of weeks later. Kept the Braun to use its trimmer. Dad also is pleased. He bought two of them. I use this as my everyday shaver. Can not beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the performance and clean shave. I gave it a try since it was portable and great price.&lt;br /&gt;This may not be an ideal for shaving heavy beards but for guys with average and light shaving, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Surprised by very clean and close cut. Instruction says, you need to give few days to get used to it..this was very true.&lt;br /&gt;After few days, however, this one became my favorite daily shaver.</li>
    <li> This product has a note saying \\&quot;try it for 30 days as it takes a month for your skin to get used to new shaver\\&quot;. I am sure they have added the note after several returns since they know you cannot return after 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will just peel off your skin and thats the best it can do. Whereever it will not harm you, it will not remove hairs either :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay because it helps shave but I still use a razor to get the hairs this travel shaver misses.</li>
    <li> Very good buy at 13.98 with SS free shipping! I have a heavy beard, and have used this 5 times a week for months and it does a good job, even though it is designed to  be a travel razor, and must be at the top for that.  I use cheap rechargeable  batteries  for it, and even if the blades gets dull enough that i need to  replace it, the razor is cheaper than buying cheap blades for other razors. Thank God such good buys can still be had.</li>
    <li> This thing works like a charm, I use it every other day and it&#x27;s been nearly a month without a need for a battery swap. The shave is extremely close, moreso than the regular saftey razors I normally use. Easy to operate and clean as well, everything comes off easily and rinses out nicely.</li>
    <li> It does not have a clipper on the side, and sorely needs it. With only one blade across the top it does not cut all facial hairs, especially on the neck, so they get longer and longer each day and the shaver will Never cut them. Had to resort to an old style razor blade :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see in the instruction book they have a very similar model that does have a clipper on the side, that is most definitely the one to get. (I could not find that model though on Amazon looking now...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does as advertised work wet or dry, and for battery operated cuts quite well, just not very thoroughly !</li>
    <li> it  good&lt;br /&gt;i  use it  well and  friends recommended to be&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied with the purchase  i ll  buy again</li>
    <li> COMPLETY DISSAPOIMENT, THATS ON OF THE WORST THING I EVER BOUGHT, IF YOU WANT TO DO A FAVOR FOR YOU THROW IT TO THE TRASHCAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT DO DE WORK , DONT SHAVE, DONT BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> It has problems getting all the hair underneath my chin and neck. Other wise it works relatively well. And i like the compact size.</li>
    <li> I dont recommend this product. I chose this product because I wanted a  shaver to shave myself and it was compact. While it is true that it is compact, it doesn&#x27;t work to shave. I spent ten minutes shaving and at the end I was as I didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> Of the three times I used it when my face was dry, I couldn&#x27;t get rid of most of the really short bear when pressing it against my skin gently. As soon as I started pressing it against my skin really hard, I cut my skin right away and also dent the metal looking wire cover. Maybe I just shouldn&#x27;t complain about it based on the price range this shaver falls into.</li>
    <li> I have a rather heavy beard, and hate shaving.  Every two years or so I shift from either electric or blade to the other.  The overall best shave really comes from the outrageously expensive Gillete Fusion blades, but as with any blade, occasionally I cut myself.  The Panasonic wet and dry shavers have long been my preferred electric, but, like ALL electric shavers they are just not quite close enough.  I have tried everything out there over the past 45 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try a travel shaver for a month long trip to Europe, and based on reviews bought one of these.  I was stunned!  The is probably the most comfortable shave of any kind I&#x27;ve ever had, and while still not as close a shave as those expensive blades, it is far closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  And after a month of daily use, the power from the battery seems to be just as strong as when the battery was new.  Does it get any better than this -  Well ............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two criticisms. First and foremost, Panasonic didn&#x27;t include a trimmer.  Why not?  Perhaps they have a more expensive model that has one, but I have to keep a straight blade around for simple sideburn trimming.  Other criticism, it is flimsy, very cheap looking. Then again, it is cheap.  In fact it is puzzling but it costs more to replace just the foil and blade than it does to buy a whole new shaver.  Almost twice as much.  So, now that I&#x27;m back from my trip, with a happy face, I&#x27;ve ordered a second one, and perhaps will order a third just to keep for when it is time to replace the blades or foil.  These shortcomings are not sufficient to lower my rating from 5 stars!</li>
    <li> The four things that I really need out of a shaver / razor are convenience of use, closeness of the shave, comfort of the shave, and cost over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really think that this shaver can hold a candle to a simple, cheap, 2-blade razor. It&#x27;s not a whole lot faster than getting out the shaving cream and making a couple passes with the old razor, it cannot possibly get NEARLY as close as a razor, and it&#x27;s not that much more comfortable, wet or dry. I will say that it can&#x27;t really cause bumps or nicks, which is good if you&#x27;re doing anything important, and it will probably last a while, so the cost over time is fairly good. There are definitely better travel shavers out there, but there are also much more expensive ways to shave on the go. I apologize for my ambiguity, but all I can say is that I&#x27;m not completely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these in Feb 2012 and it has proven to be reliable and rugged in addition to giving a pretty good shave. It fits nicely into my travel kit and seems to go easy on the batteries. Overall, it was a good purchase and I will buy another one if/when this one quits, which doesn&#x27;t appear to be coming anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years now ...&lt;br /&gt;Works great!&lt;br /&gt;Just be very careful to not damage the screen covering the blades ....&lt;br /&gt;It is very delicate ...</li>
    <li> I have one in the bathroom, overnight bag and office. It works just fine and does a great job. I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome..works everytime....easy to have and happy to have this item all the time. The best with no regrets.</li>
    <li> At all. Any hair. All it seems to do is vibrate! I was hoping to find the perfect travel shaver, but alas, this is not it!</li>
    <li> The shaving is uneven and my face hurts, worst shaver ever. DO NOT BUY IT.&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t afford a good one then you should buy a regular shaving blade.</li>
    <li> ~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Do not use rechargeable batteries. Doing so may result in the leakage of the battery and the malfunction.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;This is the exact wording of a segment from the manual of the Panasonic ES 3831 K (not quite correct English and not-quite-great-recommendation of disposable batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the box also specifically mentions alkaline no less than 3 times (!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A voice inside my head:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Hold on a second, is this the year 2013 or 1973?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Why are people still using disposables?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m at a loss when Panasonic suggest leakage with rechargeables when alkaline batteries are known for their leakage (and I have experienced it with alkalines but never with my rechargeables so far, though I&#x27;m not suggesting it&#x27;s impossible either). Assuming rechargeables leak, at the very least both battery technologies should be equally recommendable, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All companies like to talk &#x27;green&#x27; but in reality (such as with Panasonic&#x27;s insistence of disposable batteries here) they are doing precious little. What I don&#x27;t understand is that Panasonic make rechargeable batteries as well as disposables, so I&#x27;m assuming there is some technical reason other than pure profit at play here. If so, I&#x27;m dying to know what that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sanyo was bought by Panasonic a few years back and now Panasonic own their excellent Eneloop battery technology, which makes it all the more bizarre to see alkaline be suggested so strongly in favour of rechargeables in the ES3831K shaver manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PANASONIC SPARES (and waste stories)&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s take into account the cost of this device. Then let&#x27;s observe the little slip of paper that comes with this shaver with the heading \\&quot;Replacement Parts and Accessories Wet/Dry Battery Shaver ES3831\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on to list replacement part prices in US dollars. The outer foil and inner blade are basically 5 cents short of ten dollars each. Panasonic recommend replacing the outer foilonce a year and the blade every 2 years, according to the manual. I&#x27;ll let you decide whether you think it&#x27;s worth getting replacements or buying another unit. Yet another device designed to be disposed of and bought again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the hideously wasteful world we live in and mormally I try to avoid products priced like this (consumables more than the device).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to be a genius to figure out the consequences this colossal waste and re-consumption has on the environment, especially when multiplied by hundreds of thousands of people around the world who would buy such a device. Panasonic do a similar thing with their higher-priced shavers with integrated rechargeable batteries: in their manuals they explicitly suggest the user does not replace the battery themselves, but instead insists we disassemble and dispose of it properly (I can see that happening...).  If wanting replacement by chance, we should let Panasonic handle it and never attempt to replace the battery ourselves. Cost...who knows. Probably a nice little earner for Panasonic, if anyone is &#x27;stupid&#x27; enough to want to have their gadgets last a long time these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk about encouraging waste and re-consumption. The economics of everything is reversed: once it used to be cost-effective to keep the main device going well into the future; now it&#x27;s all about rebuying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AA BATTERIES&lt;br /&gt;The great thing with this shaver is it takes standard AA batteries which can be quickly swapped instead of waiting for an internal non-removable battery to charge. This is what attracted me the most. The honest-to-goodness standard AA batteries. Make mine rechargeable please (and not alkaline), and make batteries easily replaceable/swappable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned earlier, alkaline is mentioned no less than 3 times on the back of the packaging. I shake my head. And to think that people will be doing exactly what Panasonic suggests and warns against in the manual. It makes me die a little on the inside; it really does. Just multiply that by thousands (millions?) of users of this product and many thousands of batteries sitting in landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 2013 isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;Yet we are still wasting our resources away like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCE&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, I am not that impressed with the shaver; it won&#x27;t shave as close as a blade but it can (in parts) do just that; it will just take far longer than you think and always leave spots. It won&#x27;t be anywhere near as fast as a blade, but it can (in parts) be effective. Under the chin and neck, it&#x27;s pretty bad, whether wet or dry and it takes some extensive time to be shaved well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me far longer to get a complete shave than a razor, and even then it wasn&#x27;t quite clean. Initially I thought it was surprisingly good given the lowsih price and limitations of travel and whatever (occasional use) but it&#x27;s really not very practical to me. On the plus side, it seems to be constructed well and designed pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning up seems pretty easy too and the manual is mostly illustrated well, so that&#x27;s good. The parts are labelled clearly. The manual offers instructions in both English and Spanish and is brief and to-the-point and is otherwise clearly understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;Not the fastest shaver you&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Not the closest shaver you&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, you may be downright disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not unexpected for what you pay, though, but if you are used to shaving with a blade, I&#x27;d say avoid this product unless you are curious to see what a very low cost shaver can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding alkaline batteries again...&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic, please provide a technical reason why you insist on alkalines so strongly and warn against rechargeables, particularly in light of the fact that alkalines themselves can leak too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to hear back.to-the-point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is dumb-as-bricks with its alkaline insistence.&lt;br /&gt;With all that said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic, you already own the best AA/AAA Ni-MH low-self-discharge battery technology the world has to offer (Sanyo Eneloop) and it&#x27;s truly heartbreaking to hear that ugly alkaline word mentioned in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sincerely dying to know why you&#x27;d suggest leakage with rechargeables when alkalines are known for exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope we can move beyond the world of disposable batteries forever with your help. And that starts in the user guides and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic, please provide a technical reason why you insist on alkalines so strongly and warn against rechargeables, particularly in light of the fact that alkalines themselves can leak too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting to hear from you.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely.</li>
    <li> Did not shave entire face with closeness and comfort needed. Side of face so-so but neck and chin not even close to being close enough</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice small shaver. This is my very first electric shaver. I was going out of town and saw this for like 12 bucks at fry&#x27;s. So I thought I give it a shot. There was a norelco I think but I liked this one. So far the included batteries have lasted a number of shaves for me. I like the dual dry/wet on it. Unfortunately I find it works better dry for me. Every now and then it gets cleaned under the water, but mos of the time I can just open it and shake it over the trash and it&#x27;s done. I don&#x27;t have a very thick hair but this shaver seems to not do too well under my chin and neck. I have to still use a regular cheap blade to clean the rest off. It does take a bit of time to get a nice clean shave. It does work well on my cheeks and the rest of my face. In short, I have to agree with many of the posters, if you have very thick hair, this may not work too well. It would be nice if it also had the trimmer, but it is what it is. Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice shaver, it fit well in my travel bag and has lasted almost the whole month on the same batteries I think. If they improve it so it does a better job I will surely get it if I ever buy another, as long as they keep it portable.</li>
    <li> ... I just can&#x27;t get a decent shave out of it. I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything amazing, but after months of use, giving my face a chance to adjust, I&#x27;ve just never been able to manage any better than stubble. Wet or dry, lotioned or not, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. Maybe I have particularly tough beard hair. Fortunately, it turns out that stubble suits me, according to my girlfriend, so I&#x27;m rating this higher than I would otherwise since it works fine for cultivating the look she likes.</li>
    <li> shaves cleaner than gilette fusion n mach3 shavers. leaves face feeling smooth. only thing is it wont shave clean if hair is longer than 3mm</li>
    <li> The main reason I don&#x27;t complete these reviews is because most do not require more than a few words, so, I just copy and paste this each time. Stars is enough.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fairly strong, but only use it only for trimming while traveling..  Probably wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough for really close shave on tough beard.</li>
    <li> Had a Remington Rotary which worked fine, but was lost.  Bought a newer model Remington about six months ago. Remember the album cover for Frank Zappa&#x27;s \\&quot;Weasels Ripped my Flesh\\&quot;?.  That&#x27;s what the newer Remington was like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to buy the Panasonic Travel Shaver based on Amazon reviews.  Only used it twice, but this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve had in years!  First time I&#x27;ve been truly clean shaven in months.  Looks very well constructed, too.  Should work very well as a full time primary shaver, at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using it for.  When the blade and screen gives out, I&#x27;ll buy another shaver as replacement parts are as expensive as the unit itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More pleasantly surprised with this than any purchase in years.</li>
    <li> Does well at day or two old stubble, but not longer, especially sides and neck. A trimmer would be nice, but the price isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy....cannot beat the product for the price.</li>
    <li> This shaver performs awesomely. It is also great you can use it wet or dry. I was only using it dry at first, great performance. Using it wet is like being a kid with your favorite toy. It is alot a of fun shaving almost every morning. And it performs just as good when you use it wet. I will always have an extra one on hand if the first every breaks down. First one still going strong after three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Great shaver for Black men. Hardly any razor bumps if any from using it. Please try using it wet. Fun and no razor bumps to deal with.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver to own and it works just as well as the bigger size shavers. Very light weight, uses batteries so you won&#x27;t have to throw it out once the internal lithium battery goes out like the other ones. Makes a great present.</li>
    <li> It is Handy to have and easy to use and as said perfect for traveling ,work or just to maintain a clean shave</li>
    <li> I received this shaver from Amazon and have been trying to use it for the past couple days. I tried both dry shaving with it and wet shaving. Neither works for me. This thing barely cuts any hair. It&#x27;s quite ineffective. I ended up throwing it away in the trash can. Worst $14.00 ever spent. Frustrating.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy little shaver.  Gives a pretty close shave and is quite comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> excellent price and does a great job of giving me a close shave when I cant use a blade and shaving cream...which is all the time.</li>
    <li> my favorite type of electric razor...</li>
    <li> I bought one and used it twice, never again. It works, seems well made and powerful (as battery op shavers go) but my skin felt like it had been scratched all over with a wire brush. I have an Eltron el-3040, a Braun M60B and a Philips Norelco PQ208/40 - all are easy on the skin. This Panasonic is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that I might have got used to it in time, but I was unwilling to put up with the discomfort in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for this one serious fault, I really do like the machine.</li>
    <li> great that I can use a thin layer of shave cream.  cleans easily with water.  works well dry when I don&#x27;t have a sink available.  will buy another if this ever wears out.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for travel</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;TURRIBLE!&amp;#34; - Charles Barkley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though this just wouldn&#x27;t shave my beard AT ALL. Thought it&#x27;d be useful to have in the car for those times when you notice that you missed a spot while shaving but it just doesn&#x27;t work. I do have a pretty thick beard so if you&#x27;re looking for something to shave that peachfuzz this should be just fine. For anyone that has a thick beard, nope.</li>
    <li> The shaver works that i expected but i have better results in dry conditions than wet. Easy to use and clean. Very recommendable.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to replace my 0ver 30 year old Panasonic wet/dry shaver.  It works well, seems of good quality and shaves  reasonably well.  Perfect for my intended use.  And what a great value it was.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. Battery operated. Does a very good job, nice compact size, with good power. Would recommend to use.</li>
    <li> This thing didn&#x27;t work at all. What a waste of money. Maybe i&#x27;m using it incorrectly, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to trim any hair at all.</li>
    <li> The quality of the shaver is excellent.  I miss having a trimmer, but I like the&lt;br /&gt;size and sleekness of the unit so much I overlook the trimming aspect.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.  Excellent price too.</li>
    <li> excellent product for the money. inexpensive batteries. good for light work like shaving a light beard or for shaving&lt;br /&gt;around ears or other sensitive areas.............</li>
    <li> Good value, especially for what I paid on amazon.  Shaver is small.  It is slightly heavier than my everyday Panasonic shaver, however, so I end up just packing my normal shaver for most of my trips.  It also lacks a trimmer, so I can&#x27;t trim my sideburns when I need to.  Still, I paid around $12 for it, and at that price, it&#x27;s worth it to purchase as my backup shaver.</li>
    <li> It does not.  Now, for the $15.00 you can get it for - no complaints.  I took a shot on it for $13.00 including shipping figuring it did not have one and the reviews that said it did were wrong.  The version with the trimmer is the Panasonic ES3833 and costs 2-3 times more.  A very nice unit for the price.  I will put it in my truck.  If you do not need a trimmer buy it.</li>
    <li> Convenient and light, making it easy to travel with.  It is also inexpensive, so has real value.. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a 18 year old male and I do not grow super bushy facial hair in one day and using this razor every morning keeps my face smooth but sometimes I wish it shaved a little closer.</li>
    <li> I used this twice. A godsend. Then, I accidentally  dropped it from a height of aproximately four feet onto carpet, while the device was stationary and it never repowered. So sad. I have tried a couple other shavers since then and have decided this one was pretty well perfect for me, for the price. I may repurchase.</li>
    <li> The battery on my trusty Remington DA-307 is getting old and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as it used to. So I was thinking of replacing it with a new one when I stumbled across this Panasonic ES3831K travel razor powered by 2 AA batteries. The price of this razor is cheaper than Remington SP-61 replacement foil and cutters so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smaller than my DA-307 and runs nicely off of two rechargeable AA batteries. It does a decent job of shaving but it&#x27;s not at close nor as thorough as my DA-307. With the ES3831K I have to go over a spot numerous times and in the end it&#x27;s still not as close nor as smooth as my DA-307.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is still great for travel or for a &amp;#34;first&amp;#34; razor (like for my high school aged son) or for those who don&#x27;t have a heavy beard or don&#x27;t need to shave every day. For me, I bought a SP-61 refill and continue to use my DA-307 for every day, and this ES3831K for travel.</li>
    <li> Works Ok ,but requires mechanical engineer to open and put batteries in.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am not a morning person. I am in &#x27;late&#x27; mode every morning. Meaning every seconds that I can save counts, so manual shaving with shaving cream and stuff does not work for me. Unfortunately more often than not, I often forgot to shave and I really hate the touch of those stinging little beard around my mouth. But at the same time, its hard to justified to spend another ~$100 bucks for the shavers just because my bad habbit. So I searched for cheaper on-the-go shaver and found this one. And I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really surprised how small it is and how sturdy it feels in my hand. The motor is really strong and I like it more than even the charging Braun shaver at home. It gives close shaves and doesn&#x27;t irritate. And the best of all, it can be washed and runs on regular 2x2A batteries. I can pop another set of batteries in at work if I forgot to shave and the battery is dead, which to my surprise haven&#x27;t happen yet since I got it, and I shave with it almost every day with it since I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend to everyone looking for a shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my travel kit and liked it so much that I bought a second one to use daily rather than my more expensive multi-headed model. Buy more than one since the razor is cheaper than the replacement foil.</li>
    <li> Liked it so much, I bought two (2) of them!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver strictly for travel. The expensive Eltron travel-shaver that I had was an utter disappointment and even though it was costly...and highly recommended as the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34;...it was really cheaply made and far from anything special.  This Panasonic was so inexpensive, in fact, that I almost didn&#x27;t buy it thinking along the lines of, &amp;#34;how good can it be at that cost?&amp;#34;  But, I decided that I ought to give it a try. I was very happily surprised that it was every bit as nicely made...or better...than the Eltron and it gives a really close, comfortable shave. I&#x27;ve been trying it out since I got it and I have to say it&#x27;s giving as nice a shave as the Norelco that I generally use at home.</li>
    <li> Perfect starter and travel electric shaver. I switched to electric because of my sensitive skin. If you use this everyday its great. If you skip a few days you will need to shave first.</li>
    <li> This is a convenient shaver, and does a great job!  We have had these on hand for some time now!</li>
    <li> This entire shaver costs less than it did to change the blade on my last Panasonic Wet and Dry.  Shave is about the same, which means it&#x27;s better with foam or at least soap.  We&#x27;ll see if it lasts as long as my last Panasonic did (7-8 years).  The quality seems comparable even if it&#x27;s shaped completely differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design makes it easy to slip out of the hand, so you&#x27;re forced to hold onto it firmly, but doing so will numb first one hand, and when you switch to give it a break, the other hand because of the buzzing motor.  Too bad there&#x27;s nowhere to put the tiny cleaning brush.  I can see losing it fairly quickly.  Molding a spot for it into the cover or something would have been nice.</li>
    <li> Convenient for my lady patient to touch up those pesky facial hairs.</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic for a 3-week trip to the Middle East, not knowing if there would be conveniently placed electrical outlets in the private home where I would be staying.  I also brought my every-day corded Braun shaver (rated for international electrical use).  As it turns out, even tho I had the proper plug adapters, there were absolutely no electrical outlets in the bathroom outside my bedroom.  For the first shave, I struggled with the Braun in my bedroom which had inconveniently placed outlets and mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the rescue . . . the battery operated Panasonic shaver which I purchased for about $10.  While my beard is not light, more like moderate to slightly heavy, it did an excellent job once I got used to it.  Although it&#x27;s not quite as effective as a really good large electric razor, for what it is, it&#x27;s excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  I used it dry only, so it may have done even better on a wet beard.  Also, the same batteries stayed in the Panasonic the entire time and were still going strong when I left for home.</li>
    <li> Worked better than my Norelco rotary plug in charger shaver. It would still trim after I finished with the Norelco with lather or without. Batteries still going two weeks after my purchase and I use it everyday. I now have one for travel and one for home.</li>
    <li> I dropped my expensive Braun three years ago and the shaver screen was going to cost me $45.00.  I bought one of these Panasonics for $25.00 instead and couldn&#x27;t get over how awesome it was.  I replace the batteries about every 60-90 days.  Well, I dropped the Panasonic while on vacation and broke the screen on this.  While looking for a new screen, I came across the twin to my broken one only this time it was only $7.00.  I bought two of these and know I&#x27;m in good shape for years to come.  I bought three of these Panasonics for less money than the screen was going to cost me for my expensive Braun and got better shavers.</li>
    <li> very good travel shaver, if you drop it it breaks</li>
    <li> One thing I like about this shaver is that it is battery powered.  Nothing worse than having a decent rechargeable electric shaver and then losing the cord when you move!  This shaver cuts quite well, the plastic cover attaches nice and tight, doesn&#x27;t fall off like others I&#x27;ve owned.  Cleaning it is easy - since it is waterproof you can rinse it off in your sink.  All in all this is an excellent shaver at a great price.</li>
    <li> Good shaver A + + + + + AAA A + &#x3D; &#x3D; &#x3D; &#x3D; &#x3D; &#x3D; &#x3D; &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x3D; &#x3D;</li>
    <li> This thing chopped up my face. You would have to go over a spot many times to actually cut all the hair, and by the time you got all the hair it would cut your face. Awful razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazingly cheap, and at the same time well made. It shaves most of my facial hair really well and does not irritate the skin if I move it slowly and don&#x27;t run over the same spot too many times. The problem is that it will not shave some of the hair on my neck no matter what I do. Those will get longer and longer, and eventually start looking really bad, especially up close. I&#x27;ve made the mistake of taking this shaver with me on a two-week trip, and was really disappointed with its performance. I will either have to bring my main Panasonic shave with me when I travel, or buy another small one with a trimmer.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I shave.  This should be in every man&#x27;s cabinet.  This crushes any shaver at Walmarts with their 3 months before holes appear in the foils  shavers.  Been using this for quite a while and it&#x27;s still as good as new.</li>
    <li> Very good product, handles the daily shaving nicely and quickly:)</li>
    <li> Great for travel but, for at home I&#x27;ll stick to something a bit bigger/better. Does work, but takes more time and is more likely to irritate .</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work. Doesn&#x27;t shave close or consistently.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver...easy on the face and light weight.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, but doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this product. Much happier to have it since the Sharper Image product that I always enjoyed for years until last year when it went wrong itself. I love the feeling of holding the shaver. Seems to be sturdy.</li>
    <li> With batteries, the ES3831 weighs 6/10 of an ounce MORE than my SA40. No beard trimmer and too heavy for a travel shaver BUT it&#x27;s so VERY comfortable and works so well, I&#x27;ve been using it for my everyday shaver. Been using for a week and AA batteries give no indication of giving up. I love this shaver!</li>
    <li> Good for months of use. Works well for people who do not want too close a shave as there is one blade. Prevents skin irritation. 3 rd one I have bought in 3 years. Daily use for a year. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Great shaver I use it for trips does a good job</li>
    <li> I used to use regular razors until I tried this panasonic ES3831 electric razor, and the result were from night to day. Since I started shaving with regular razors , I had to wait at least a week or more to avoid redness and irritation at the end always had to let the hair to grow too large. Since I bought this electric shaver , I can shave every two day with out any problem, of course, you have to adapt to any electric shaver , it took me like 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I notice a few hair could not be cut, that&#x27;s because with the regular razor I never noticed those hairs growing really weird, the electric one shaves so close, that you start noticing all those hairs, so I&#x27;ve been pulling them out with tweezer so hopefully they will start growing in the right direction. The type of shave this thing does is like shaving down and then up with a regular razor, of course, without the irritation and cuts and itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been powering it with a pair of Sanyo eneloop AA rechargeable batteries and the have lasted for more than a month. Cleaning is easy, after shaving I always use a dust off and then liquid soap. The best thing is, you won&#x27;t need any shaving cream,water to constantly clean the razor and you don&#x27;t need to have your face wet, I just put a bit of after shave and that&#x27;s it. For the price and practicality, is excellent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent price.  Shaves better than similar shaver from Braun that is twice the price.  Shaving head is twice the size of Braun.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This shaver exceeds my expectations.  I will use it for a trip to Europe and not worry about adapters.</li>
    <li> Fantastic inexpensize razor!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing little machine at a very low price.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. My husband had one and we thought he lost it, so bought another after. Of course we found the first! The razor is handy and effective so having two is just fine. The instructions say to use exclusively for a month and love it. It doesn&#x27;t take that long to love it!</li>
    <li> Reliable! Just works. I had one for years before it finally broke as I dropped it. Battery lasts for along time.</li>
    <li> This shaver works perfectly for me.  2 AA batteries easily changed.  Totally portable.  I use it every day but it&#x27;s not as close as a double blade cartridge.  If I have a date I&#x27;ll break out my Gillette Sensor.</li>
    <li> This travel shaver is ok for the price. It gets the job done. You might want to look for better.</li>
    <li> Good Product. As expected. No compains. If you compare prices and is the best, there is no hold back to it.</li>
    <li> My husband had this rendition for a while and it finally died so we purchased several others through target, CVS, etc and returned all of them.  Then I decided to try Amazon again - and perfect - now my man is happy again - he uses it daily and its perfect and compact.  he is a manly guy and fitness trainer and he loves it.  Go for it!</li>
    <li> this razor was mutch better  then  many travei razors i had in the past.it works it seems exceptionly well with redhargeable nimh batteries. i plan on  buying  several  more for gifts. a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The performance, simplicity, long battery life and above all the price make this product more than a travel razor, but an everyday one. No base, no cord to plug in, absolutely a must for traveller.</li>
    <li> I use it as a backup or travel razor.  The razor works very well and battery life is good as well.  Quality razor for the price.</li>
    <li> powerful shaver, did well on my cheeks, but it would not cut my neck hair for all the trying in the world.  Returning and purchased a rotary style instead.</li>
    <li> It shaves ok.  I like the Braun shaver better.</li>
    <li> Cuts pretty well, though it takes a little longer than ones with two or three heads.  Battery lasts a while.  For the price, worth it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased every type of electric shaver out there. Braun/Norelco dry shavers and Panasonic wet/dry shavers ranging from $50 to $300. I have found the most comfortable shaves for sensitive skin to come from a combination of disposable straight shavers on the neck and wet/dry electric shavers on the face, with liquid Dove soap for sensitive skin for men as a shaving gel. Now as for the Panasonic Travel Shaver: this little guy performs as well as the pricy $300 electric shavers. You don&#x27;t get an LCD readout, and you have to buy batteries, but these shavers are less than $15 each! So I think it definitely comes out ahead. It is beyond capable as a travel shaver and I use it as an everyday shaver as well.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the person who uses it is very pleased.  It was well worth the price of the gift.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!</li>
    <li> Strong - Easy - Durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this to shave my head and face and I get a nice clean shave every time</li>
    <li> Workes great it will give you a close shave</li>
    <li> It does not work: Itried everything including changing batteries etc.This is the SECOND try; The ffirst shaver did not work ;you send me a replacement which again does not work. What&#x27;s your advice?&lt;br /&gt;Disgustedly,&lt;br /&gt;a (former?) good customer.</li>
    <li> Awesome little shaver. I use it everyday. Works awesome. Purchased directly from Panasonic for less than 6 dollars shipped during a sale. Nice. Should have bought several to have backups.</li>
    <li> Item performs as expected.  If you travel this could be your razor.  We dry looks interesting.  Shaver is tight and  should be able to stand facet flow water stream.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Works perfectly as intended.</li>
    <li> I am on-call and drive cars part-time. Thing is- I don&#x27;t always shave in the morning. If I get a call I&#x27;m prepared to shave in the car.&lt;br /&gt;Great little shaver to have on-hand. I love mine. ~BobD</li>
    <li> A great portable razor traveling, uses two AA batteries. Shaves close and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning up the neck beard. It&#x27;s a very close shave, so I don&#x27;t use it on my face, as I like to keep a little stubble. I use Philips Norelco QT4014/42 beardtrimmer to maintain the stubble look and use this Panasonic for my neck when I travel.</li>
    <li> my bf said this is good on his face. I beg to agree because he really looks clean now.</li>
    <li> When I needed to replace my well used $200 Braun, I saw this and and thought it was worth a shot before investing in something a lot more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the product for the price.  It easily gets most of my facial hair on a day to day basis with minimal irritation.&lt;br /&gt;It does miss a few certain hairs on my throat and sideburns every time, I think because they are particularly thick hairs. So on the weekend I end up doing the whole shaving cream and manual razor thing, and I use this to get me through the week.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries means no charging cable to keep track of. Still on my first set so I cannot speak to battery life yet.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as replacement of my 4 years old shaver. Also Panasonic, also battery powered, also wet/dry but older model. I was 100% satisfied with my old shaver, but unfortunately it was discontinued. I&#x27;m talking about ES3830 (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EGW3JA?tag&#x3D;afullcup04-20).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new shaver came on time and the packaging was intact. I installed AA rechargeables and started dry shaving. Worked fine. Next day tried it under the shower. Worked even better! No \\&quot;leftovers\\&quot; or burns. Cleaning is just washing under the running water. I think I will never use this tiny cleaning brush they included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I want to focus on the design \\&quot;enhancements\\&quot; which made the shaver less convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this model has rounded bottom which looks great. The old model had a flat bottom and could stand on the table. Between the look and functionality I&#x27;d rather choose the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade transparent plastic cover for no apparent reason was made asymmetrical. So you can use  it in a \\&quot;correct\\&quot; orientation only. The old shaver cover worked both way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are 2 cons. which are minor and do not impact my marks - an excellent value!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I needed a smaller, battery powered shaver for travel. I expected a lot of compromises, but what I found was actually a quite good shaver! (the only major feature it lacks is a beard trimmer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my normal shaver, this unit is tiny, about half the size. It&#x27;s also battery powered, so that you can swap out rechargeable AAs. Honestly, I&#x27;ve found that experience to be digging out the brand-specific charging cable. I&#x27;ve also had to give up on a number of shavers through the years because their batteries lost capacity, and the replacement shaver battery cost almost as much as the shaver. Like other reviewers have noted, you can go for a LONG time on a single pair of AAs with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite only having one row of blades, that don&#x27;t have  flexible joint, I still am able to achieve a quality shave. Makes me feel like that might have been a feature invented by marketing to sell more shavers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is also waterproof, which is handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially given the inexpensive price, this shaver is definitely worthy of 5 stars if you need a small, convenient travel shaver.</li>
    <li> it has a very nice feel to it and looks really neat an nice for travel use or if you just want something small and portable</li>
    <li> I have to be clean shaved everyday for work. I keep this shaver in my car in case I don&#x27;t have time or forget to shave at home. It works good and shaves well. It&#x27;s definitely not as smooth as a Norelco, but I would absolutely recommend this as a backup, or secondary shaving device. One thing to note, it works the best when shaving only one day&#x27;s growth. It seems that anything longer than that, doesn&#x27;t get shaved very well and is spotty.</li>
    <li> Battery powered razor that is very good for travel, especially to countries where different voltages and plug configurations are used. Close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this does anything more than make noise...  Lots of noise...</li>
    <li> Amazing little razor. I bought it because it was inexpensive and I wanted a razor to use while I&#x27;m dealing with injuries and didn&#x27;t want to struggle to shave at the sink.  I may use this most of the time because it&#x27;s that good. It runs on regular batteries, so no worrying about the batteries not being charged when I need it. I can just drop new ones in, though I haven&#x27;t yet since I&#x27;ve bought it. They seem to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall surprising little shaver. As all single micro screen shavers, sometimes it takes a few passes to get it all, but it&#x27;s a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t take long. Perfect for traveling or daily use.</li>
    <li> Product broke already. Foil razor peeled off</li>
    <li> Not a good razor. Tried it a couple times, it gave a terrible shave, I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Cuts extremely close, very easy to clean.  Holds a charge very well.  Great all around shaver!</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. Great to stick in car and use for times when you need a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;Jim Salih</li>
    <li> This little thing is fantastic. Great for traveling since it uses 2 double AA batteries and is super small and light weight. I actually sometimes even use it at home since it does such a great job.  Do not look any further buy this little gadget you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m putting this at 5 stars right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should start off by saying I have never used an electric shaver before. I usually used an old fashioned razor a few times a week. I recently got a new job and need to stay clean shaven every day. I started looking into electric shavers not knowing if I would even like it. I chose to get a cheap one so I wouldn&#x27;t be in the hole too much if I stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews, this seemed like the best bet. I&#x27;ve had this about a week and I like it a lot. I&#x27;ve shaved just about every day and it works great. Its a nice close shave, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting nics. The battery seems to be running the exact same as it was a week ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover easily comes off for quick cleaning with soap and water. This unit also includes a small brush to clean the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is related (although I think it is), a few days after getting this a bunch of small pimples started appearing in clusters on my lower cheek by my chin. I think I got an ingrown hair. Again, not sure if its even related to this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very happy, especially with the price. 5/5</li>
    <li> Works well. Would like to see a flip cover instead of the detachable plastic cover.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave every day and then this misses lots of whiskers. It is a sturdy unit and if you like a foil shaver this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I like the battery situation with this razor:&lt;br /&gt;* takes 2 AA batteries&lt;br /&gt;* powerful even with re-chargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;* with 2-3 uses per week, can go for months without needing batteries swapped.&lt;br /&gt;* easy to use battery compartment (twist open the bottom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver travels well: doesn&#x27;t need much space and holds a charge.  Most razors I own with a plug-in A/C cord and battery expect to only run part of a week without re-charging, while this unit seems to expect to run on AA batteries for some time.  Also, the slide-on power means no buttons to accidentally press while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the best compliment I&#x27;ve paid this razor is buying a second one just in case anything goes wrong (which it hasn&#x27;t in the ~18 months I&#x27;ve owned it).</li>
    <li> Very efficient use of batteries, but that doesn&#x27;t make up for the lousy shave. Used for more than a month and it still does not shave close. I&#x27;ve gotten better results from a $20 Braun travel shaver. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchased. First one Lasted 15 years. Great Product</li>
    <li> I bought this to carry on short overnight  trips.  Perfect for what I needed. If your face is already accustomed to foil shavers,  this is a nice extra one to have.  Shouldn&#x27;t use it as a primary  razor. Does a great job on stubble but not  on longer hairs.  Good quality and nice feel.</li>
    <li> This shaver is way better than I expected. It works better than a lot of the older &amp;#34;home use&amp;#34; electric shavers I have owned, which costed much more money! I used it on a recent 4 week vacation, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It does a great job both wet and dry, and has really good battery life considering they are AA batteries! I shaved every 3 days or so, and the batteries lasted the whole trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy a more expensive shaver when I got back, but said forget it. I just use this thing! I&#x27;m sure there are nicer shavers, but I generally still shave with razors and just use electric every now and then. The price of this thing is a steal, and is perfect for trips.</li>
    <li> Great machine, well built with power you wouldn&#x27;t think is capable from a 2aa machine. I now have my goto shaver when going away on trips. 👌</li>
    <li> Good little shaver!  Battery cover seems to be secure, no water leakage into compartment.  This is my second shaver, same model.  Cheaper to buy a new shaver than it is to buy consumables (screen, blade).  AA battery operation is a big plus, I use NiZn (not nicad or NiMH) 1.6v batteries, and runs for 2 weeks at least before batteries need to be charged.  Alkaline last about a week before noticeable performance drop appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was a similar model with beard/stache/burns trimmer.  Lost a star because consumables cost so much.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay for a quick shave on the go, but it misses many hairs. If you want a really close shave, better off with a more expensive and well-known brand, or simply use cream and a razor.</li>
    <li> Along with this, I&#x27;ve also owned a few low end rotary electrics, and a mid-tier foil style razor. As you go up in price, you tend to be able to shave more quickly, though the final result is similar. The rotaries I&#x27;ve tried seem to do a slightly better job at the underchin area (the toughest place for electrics), but not by much.  The drawback with the ES3831 is that while powerful, there&#x27;s a lot of vibration. Although all the manuals for electrics will say not to push against your skin, it does help to press a bit get a closer shave. It&#x27;s tougher to get a feel for how much pressure to apply (to avoid irritating the skin excessively or pressing past the hair) when the razor&#x27;s shaking so much. A $45 rotary model by Philips is much more sedate in comparison, allowing more precise use.   It seems to be power efficient, as the batteries last a very long time - longer than a single charge on the rotary rechargeable I have. The fact that it uses AA batteries makes it great for travel - there&#x27;s no adapter to bring. I use rechargables, and those provide plenty of juice for most trips.  It&#x27;s a no-frills shaver, but nevertheless built solidly with a nice dense weight to it. Great - for the cost. The experience of a razor thirty to forty  dollars more is a big improvement over this in some ways, but ends up tripling the price of the ES3831.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES3831 Wet/Dry battery operated shaver never bites/snags your skin and is very easy for daily use; it&#x27;s my new favorite and I&#x27;ve since donated away all of my old shavers (after sterilizing them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE that this shaver works best for daily use; foil systems do not have a comb/guide so they take forever to cut longer hair meaning don&#x27;t skip days.  It&#x27;s much easier on your skin&#x27;s appearance if you take the minute or two daily to pass over the area you need to keep trim (your significant other may like that too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to daily electric shaving, you should use a shaving rash product more than once a day for the first month; it takes a full month for skin to adjust to any new shaving system; to avoid skin irritation pick up product for shaving rash and it&#x27;ll prevent shaving rash (tend skin is good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery operated shavers are the best for travel as they are more compact and it&#x27;s easy to get new batteries* if needs be (or to bring more Eneloop reusable longer lasting than disposable batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This shaver is more environmentally friendly than rechargeable-shavers as rechargeable shavers do not have mass recycling options as standard batteries do.  This shaver is particularly environmentally friendly if you use Eneloop rechargeable batteries and Eneloops last MUCH longer between charges than built-in-battery shavers (Eneloops lasts at least twice as long as disposables and they&#x27;ll pay for themselves within a few uses).</li>
    <li> I never ended up using it because It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. practically a waste of good money.</li>
    <li> Nice compact size.  Good battery life.  Decent close shave.  Cheap.  Easy to clean. &#x27;nuff said</li>
    <li> Hubby had a Norelco for which replacement heads cost more than the original shaver. I ordered him this after reading reviews, and he is more than happy with the close shave, plus - takes up less room in his luggage.</li>
    <li> Good razor at a great price</li>
    <li> This thing won&#x27;t cut hair. And leaves the worst razer burn.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver, but no A/C is a little drawback (minus one rating star). I use it as an every day shaver. I bought a basic re-charger with rechargeable batteries for $9. Just remember this is for day to day stubble, not for full grown beards. It&#x27;s every bit as good as the double blade Panasonic wet/dry that I replaced. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> good razor and its compact size is perfect.But brush too small and easily misplaced. A space should have been created to hold it.</li>
    <li> It keep falling apart when I try to use it.</li>
    <li> it is quite excelent. i loved it. it is what i expected. thanks very much. i will keep buying here</li>
    <li> great shaver 4 a quick clean-up and would recommend it to any one....great on rough beards,, gotta love it. this is my second one......</li>
    <li> I AM A BLACK MAN AND HAVE PROBLEMS WITH RAZOR BUMPS. I TRIED THIS SHAVE AND LOVE IT. SMALL AND COMPACT BUT POWERFUL, THIS LITTLE SHAVER HAS BECOME MY EVERYDAY SHAVER. I USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES WHICH LAST  A LONG TIME BEFORE NEEDING TO BE RECHARGED. HAVE SINCE ORDER A SECOND ON FOR BACKUP. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHAVER.</li>
    <li> It might be small or whatever, but this little machine knows how to do its job perfectly!! I like it &amp; its the best!! :)</li>
    <li> Tiny shaver with a very strong motor. I don&#x27;t use it much, but it sounds like it will last forever. The only complaint is that the protective plastic cover pops off too easily. Be careful when you throw it in your shaving bag.</li>
    <li> Tough to beat for a travel shaver. Panasonic quality, clean shave, can be used in the shower. Runs on batteries and that&#x27;s good for a travel shaver as who wants to pack chargers and cords.</li>
    <li> good,statisfy my need</li>
    <li> This was my first electric shaver.  Given my sparse facial hair and the good reviews this item seemed to get, I decided to try it.  As you can tell by my rating, it was not a good experience.  I found that it really didn&#x27;t seem to take any hair off, despite it &amp;#34;sounding&amp;#34; like it was.  It also gave my face some very uncomfortable, itchy, rash-type feeling.  I must have some unique type of hair though, since many other reviewers seem to like the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At less than $15, you can take a chance on this product, especially if you&#x27;re expectations are low.  But for me, it definitely was a poor purchase.</li>
    <li> This device is powerful for its price. It may not be as smooth as the higher end shaver, but it does the job better and faster than some more expensive shaver I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> Great product in and out of shower!  Wonderful to travel with and fits great in your hand!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good travel shaver.  Not going to replace a larger Norelco for every day use.</li>
    <li> Adequately does the job but you don&#x27;t get a close shave like you do with the full size panasonic shaver. It is very compact which is nice. It does not have a case of any type which is too bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the army and have spent hundreds on electric shavers that claim to get all those trouble areas...chin, neck. Even with those expensive ones, I still have to touch up my neck with a bic.&lt;br /&gt;  This baby is so powerful and doesn&#x27;t hurt my face at all. If I spend a lot of time on my neck, it looks decent enough that no one mentions a bad shave, but I am usually in a hurry and still use a bic...just not as much.&lt;br /&gt;  For the price, size, and the fact that it is battery powered, this is a great buy. I have only had it for a week, but am so far very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great shaver at a fantastic price.  I wanted to get a new head for my Braun shaver but I would have had to spend 3 times the price of this item just for the replacement head.  For less than $14.00 I could have a new shaver!  Really?  What have I got to lose?  I ordered this thinking it would be a cheap temporary replacement.  Boy, was I surprised to see how well it shaved and how well it was made.  This is now my full time shaver.  I am done buying replacement shaver heads for my Braun.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome little razor. It is amazing for the price, especially with the wet/dry capability. I do wish it had a trimmer though.</li>
    <li> this product excellent for barber do the outline for hair cut but you shoud use recharge battery I buy about over 40 for me and my friend</li>
    <li> Normally, I am a blade shaver. I got this travel model so that I didn&#x27;t need to bring razor blades nor find water for shaving during vacation.  I just got back from vacation and am very pleased with this little guy. Nothing fancy. It wasn&#x27;t nearly as close as a blade. It left my skin slightly irritated. But it worked. I could step out onto the balcony so as to not disturb others sleeping in the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to clean. Open the top and blow it out. In the week I was traveling, I never bothered with a brush or rinsing it under water. I did clean it thoroughly when I got home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used it for a week. The battery lasted fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was close enough. Immediately after shaving, it felt quite close. However, the closeness didn&#x27;t last as long as a blade. It maneuvered easily about my face, including under the chin. It did require multiple passes to do a decent job. But, I didn&#x27;t press down; I just floated over my face.</li>
    <li> getting this thing out of the package was unbearable. i had a scissors but still had the worst time trying to cut through the plastic. as for the razor itself, its nice but i think its kinda noisy &amp; the instructions aren&#x27;t clear for the on/off operation.since it is just a travel shaver, it will do just fine i guess.</li>
    <li> Again, it was price that first attracted me, as well as the resemblance to an older, corded Braun unit I used to have.  Indeed, the feel in the hand is similar to that Braun (the cord never seemed to bother me.)  But the Braun died, and comparable models today seem to be about 4-10 times more epensive than this model.  So ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the shave is only OK, and it seems to take longer than any other shaver I have (see my list of current models below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it was heavier than most of my other &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; shavers.  True it is noticeably smaller than these others, but &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; might also imply that lighter is better.  The models I&#x27;m comparing with are all  built-in rechargeable (but most are lighter)  In increasing order or weight, I have:&lt;br /&gt;  Shaver Pro -- 5oz&lt;br /&gt;  Panaxonic ES-SA40 -- 5.25oz&lt;br /&gt;  Panasonic  ES3831 -- 6oz&lt;br /&gt;  Norelco 7325XL -- 6.5 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES3831calls for 2 AA Alkaline batteries, but I found it worked just as well with high-quality rechargable AA&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I needed a basic shaver since I had been using my dad&#x27;s old eltron and braun shavers and this was highly reviewed and dirt cheap so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. I was not disappointed. The only thing it&#x27;s missing is a pop out trimmer, but at less than $10 you can&#x27;t fault it for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the same AmazonBasics rechargeable battery (the white eneloop clones) for weeks and it hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great in the shower too. It&#x27;s not really my thing but I wanted to try it out.</li>
    <li> For $13  I shouldn&#x27;t have expected more than a decent shave at best. If this is the only thing laying around it&#x27;ll do, but if you want a better shave I suggest you spend a little more on a more capable shaver.</li>
    <li> Received product new in box and it doesn&#x27;t even work. Cannot get it to turn on. Product is a waste of time/money</li>
    <li> muy bueno el producto la entrega  muy bien por parte del vendedor , espero que sigan asi son personas muy reponzables en cada uno de los pasos</li>
    <li> it came broken, I first thought the problem lied in the batteries, I bought a new pair of batteries, but still not working, I threw it away, I did not even bother to get it changed</li>
    <li> good item , fast delivery</li>
    <li> Best little Travel Shaver made.  I have just ordered my 3rd one today.  Quick good shaves for a great price.  I have started using it daily this past month.  The first one I ordered several years ago was loosing its blade sharpness, it is less expensive to ordered a new one then to order the replacement kit.</li>
    <li> works really well and shaves close! only down fall is its not good with sensitive skin (USE WET!!) never dry!</li>
    <li> this works well.  for the money and for travel i would buy another one if this breaks.  good razor for the $.</li>
    <li> Very convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I thought there was a clipper attached but there isn&#x27;t.  Less useful than I thought. five more words required?  word</li>
    <li> Love it for quick shave jobs on the go...I keep a beard but jot a moustacheso it&#x27;s nice for cleaning up my upper lip</li>
    <li> This is the best pocket shaver I have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite powerful and offers a very close shave especially for the tricky area below the lower lip and above the chin.&lt;br /&gt;I wish, however, that the shaver were either white with black lettering or black with white lettering.&lt;br /&gt;I like this shaver so much that I have ordered a second one: one for use at home and one I keep in my car.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;G/P Dave</li>
    <li> such a close shave! This is  a wonderful little device that will do exactly what it is intended to do. I keep it in my car to retouch throughout the day in between meetings, it leaves no trace of stubs at all. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works for short a stubble. I was trying to use this to avoid using a razor, but my facial hair is a bit thicker and longer for this to work efficiently. However, my I gave it to my dad and and he loves it for shaving his short stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;For a bit over 10 bucks this will do the job, traveling or not.&lt;br /&gt;Best for those who shave every 1-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was strong enough to handle thicker hair.</li>
