    <li> I love this soft scented perfume it is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> This is perhaps the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever had. It is light and clean but still feminine and sweet. Great great product!!</li>
    <li> Smells great...fresh and clean.  Not \\&quot;old-ladyish\\&quot;.  The one drawback is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this fragrance I have waited many years to buy this. Can&#x27;t wait to get it try it on ok... not bad I think I like it..Well later on I realize I can&#x27;t smell it. I spray more on and I still can&#x27;t smell it.&lt;br /&gt;The next day I spray 20 squirts on me and my clothes and then ask different people if they smell perfume.. no is the answer..&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the said thing i have layered the fragrances with the body creme...&lt;br /&gt;I am not blaming the seller it has to be the co. who makes it..</li>
    <li> To me Best smell ever And its the cutest little bottle</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful,  just wish the scent were stronger.</li>
    <li> While Philosphy&#x27;s Amazing Grace fragrance smells wonderful.  It only lasts on me an hour if I&#x27;m lucky.  Maybe if you layer all the products together it may last longer.  It does smell very nice though.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent of all time! I love love love this fragrance! It is not over powering and it lasts all day! The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work right, I have never ever gotten a product from philosophy that the sprayer or pump worked right, I wish the company would correct that because I love this fragrance but will switch to something else since the sprayers NEVER work.</li>
    <li> Does not smell the same as the one in department stores. Wears off very fast too. Cheap price but you kind of get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products &amp; especially,\\&quot;Amazing Grace\\&quot;. However, for the third time, the sprayer/mister doesn&#x27;t work. Pretty worthless without it. No More for me.</li>
    <li> IT IS NOT THE FRAGRANCE THAT i AM LOOKING FOR AND DOES NOT SEEM TO LAST VERY LONG. i AM LOOKING FOR A VERY FRESH AND CLEAN FRAGRANCE i GUESS LIKE YOUR JUST OUT OF THE SHOWER.</li>
    <li> I use the fragrance together with the body wash and lotion from Amazing Graze. Great fresh scent. My new favorite..</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance.  It is my favorite.  I spray a little on my favorite blanket sometimes when I take a nap on the couch.  It makes me happy!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite! Clean, beautiful, and always appropriate for any occasion, including the office. I always get compliment when I wear this</li>
    <li> Absolutely Amazing!! Exactly what I wanted/ordered..I love this perfume! Arrived ahead of schedule, very pleased!</li>
    <li> My mom loves it...very soft but certainly gets noticed! For the woman in your life, get a small bottle and see what she&#x27;s been missing!</li>
    <li> Fabulous light clean scent great for everyday use. I work in the medical field I don&#x27;t want an over powering perfume that could offend or irritate my patients. I layer it on top of vanilla lotion and the combo is perfect.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Amazing Grace!!! I wear it every day, and get compliments all day long about how good I smell. The scent is very clean, and fresh, and very feminine.  I also use the shower gel, body lotion, and whipped body cream. I love love love it!!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and the price was great! I use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> Spray smelled rancid and had a strong chemical smell. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, but it&#x27;s not long-lasting. Seem to use more than I&#x27;m used to with others.</li>
    <li> I thought this was supposed to smell so great and it sort of does but I only smell it right as I put it in then it&#x27;s just gone.</li>
    <li> Scent is on point and smells beauitful.</li>
    <li> No staying power at all....disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought Amazing Grace in the trial size bottle for when I&#x27;m on the go.  Lovely scent for spring or summer!</li>
    <li> fabulos light perfume for everyday, love the travel size!</li>
    <li> Grace is subtle and soft.  Does&#x27;t stay with you all day, but then what does?  I just reapply when needed.  This is a nice small bottle that is easy to place in my purse.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s light, refreshing, the only issue I have is it doesn&#x27;t last long.  I love everything Philosophy makes so I order over and over again.  4 stars only because it doesn&#x27;t hold the fragrance longer than an hour.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast service</li>
    <li> this small bottle will last months its clean and fresh and great for any time of the year.</li>
    <li> It is the same as my first bottle and I love it.  To some it may be too light or doesn&#x27;t last long, but it works for me!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This fragrance cracks me up.  It smells EXACTLY like Coppertone suntan lotion.  The old kind...that Coppertone with the photo of the little girl with the suntan line and her dog.  Not to say suntan lotion is a bad smell--I love it--but it is not what I would call &amp;#34;grace&amp;#34;.  Having said that, wearing Grace in the dead of winter may be a pick-me-up.  I give it 3 stars just because it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it was called &amp;#34;Coppertone&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> eVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW...WHAT ARE YOU WEARING THAT SMELLS SO GOOD,FRESH AND CLEAN!!!!  w o n d e r f u l PRODUCT!!!!  WORTH THE MONEY YOU WILL SPEND!</li>
    <li> Love this soft scent.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, however.  This bottle size is nice for purse.  Refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> I just love the scent of this perfume spray!!  This bottle is small enough to carry in your purse or car.  Philosophy has so many wonderful products and scents</li>
    <li> I love the amazing grace products both shower gel and lotion so I decided on adding another layer&lt;br /&gt;and chose this.  I like the nice clean smell without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing .  Not over powering at all.  I get alot of compliments on my scent.  It doesnt enter a room before me which is a huge plus.</li>
