      <li>so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>Awesome product!</li>
      <li>They stay perfectly.</li>
      <li>Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
      <li>These clips are cute and best of all, they hold</li>
      <li>They work good, just wish I could pick the color.</li>
      <li>They hold fairly well in my hair.  </li>
      <li>good product &#x3D; using it for crafting</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find these on Amazon because these are the best clips for holding my curly hair, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in stores for months.</li>
      <li>These are my favorite hair clips!</li>
      <li>These DO NOT have that kind of end.  </li>
      <li>Good for fine, silky hair in which clips tend to slip out.</li>
      <li>They work great, and the price is right.</li>
      <li>Most seem to be designed for children&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for these everywhere and haven&#x27;t been able to find!&lt;br</li>
      <li>These work better</li>
      <li>These clips hold my hair back, and in place with the perfect amount of tension.  </li>
      <li>It was great to find these on Amazon and buy a whole pack.</li>
      <li>that most others I have found.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Love the assorted colors, and yes, they do pinch my hair every once in awhile, but easily, 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I love the size as they are great for clipping my bangs back or wearing two on each side and hold a lot more hair than those 1.5 inch, grabby kind.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was looking for clips that work with fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is about these, because they look like they&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
      <li>They are smooth.  </li>
      <li>Smooth purchase, no problems.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to have to continue my search for good hair clips to replace the old style of these that worked so well.</li>
      <li>These are excellent clips which hold the hair very tightly in place and do not slip out of fine hair.</li>
      <li>Best barrettes ever, but hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These clips will cut or pull a full strands of hair every time you take them out.  </li>
      <li>If you have fine and straight hair, this is what you are looking for!</li>
      <li>I was hoping to love these because the other snap clips I own always find a way to pull out some hair.</li>
      <li>I cant find them in the stores here anymore.they&#x27;re just the right length,2 1/2 inches,and  they don&#x27;t pull or break the hair.</li>
      <li>They will not hold a huge amount of hair, like some of the older style barettes (two horizontal bar type).  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clip and open very easy.</li>
      <li>My hair has gotten caught on the inner corner many times while taking it out.</li>
      <li>I ripped out hair the first couple times because I didn&#x27;t realize it was happening.</li>
      <li>I found them once in a CVS in Rochester and was kicking myself for not buying several packages as I seem to lose these magical and elusive barrettes.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for-</li>
      <li>So cute and just what I needed to pin my bangs back.</li>
      <li>My hair is long and very fine.</li>
      <li>These are different .... and definitely appropriate for adult&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I have bought prob $100 worth of other clips in hopes of finding an alternative, but nothing makes me as happy as these little gems.</li>
      <li>In either case it doesn&#x27;t work better than any other brands I have.</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>They function as normal though hence two stars.</li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t hold fine hair as well as other clips.  </li>
      <li>I have been frantically looking for more for about 6 months as I am down to my last 2, which I watch like a hawk!</li>
      <li>You can prevent this by either holding it more open during removal or by bending it so it doesn&#x27;t shut so tightly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s selg I find clips that will hold adult hair.  </li>
      <li>The package was clearly old and some of the paint or coating was chipped off the clips.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are tight and just the right size!</li>
      <li>I have dark hair and those are less notable than the shiny coated ones that I received instead.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the old style clips in future.</li>
      <li>are really reviewing those other snap clips that have two overlapping bits on the ends that grab strands.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different lengths and styles, but by far these are the only ones that work for my hair type.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair that I like to pull back.</li>

<li> The first photo is what I was going off of - with the dark metallic browns and black.</li>
<li> having short little strands of hair hanging down would be very frustrating.&lt;br</li>
<li> I really appreciate the ease of finding hard to find, needed items on Amazon.</li>
<li> These are larger than I expected and slip from my hair.</li>
<li> These are long, which I like -</li>
<li> I have thick voluminous hair and they don&#x27;t keep much hair up.</li>
<li> I was careful not to loose it.</li>
<li> The side that bends when it&#x27;s open is too tight which allows hair to become pulled when you&#x27;re trying to remove it.</li>
<li> Just what I expected.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found that if you take them out carefully they will not snag hair too badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This stays in my hair even after a rough surf session, but careful when you take these things out.</li>
<li> These stay in place, but they tear my hair a bit when I try to carefully pull them out.</li>
<li> I found that some of the other triangular shaped clips were too loose, and slipped out of my hair.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately due to the ouchie removal I cannot recommend.</li>
<li> As other reviewers have stated, it will pull hairs out.</li>
<li> Not worth it in my opinion.</li>
<li> You do have to be careful releasing them, or they will catch a few strands.</li>
<li> I have long, thick hair.</li>
<li> Looking for a little shorter clips.</li>
<li> Goody must&#x27;ve changed the clips because these have a rougher surface, and end up getting caught in and pulling out my hair, not easily sliding in and out like the ones I had bough previously.</li>
<li> long, thin clips.</li>
<li> my difficult, short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
<li> Not sure why.  </li>
<li> I have really thick hair</li>
<li> I have very thick wave almost curly hair.</li>
<li> Still deciding whether to return and play another game of roulette.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve said these are crazy hard to find in Seattle.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing but not worth the expense of returning.</li>
<li> and I gave two stars for that - however, I&#x27;ve not used them once without losing three or four hairs the hard and painful way.</li>
<li> Horrible little clips!  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these everywhere and haven&#x27;t been able to find!&lt;br /&gt;They are tight and just the right size!</li>
    <li> This stays in my hair even after a rough surf session, but careful when you take these things out. My hair has gotten caught on the inner corner many times while taking it out. I ripped out hair the first couple times because I didn&#x27;t realize it was happening.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t hold fine hair as well as other clips.  Plus, I find my hair gets caught on the ends.  I&#x27;ll stick to the old style clips in future.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clip and open very easy.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, it will pull hairs out. The side that bends when it&#x27;s open is too tight which allows hair to become pulled when you&#x27;re trying to remove it. You can prevent this by either holding it more open during removal or by bending it so it doesn&#x27;t shut so tightly. In either case it doesn&#x27;t work better than any other brands I have.</li>
    <li> I search for these barrettes every time I&#x27;m at the store. I have fine, thin hair that I like to pull back. I&#x27;ve tried several different lengths and styles, but by far these are the only ones that work for my hair type. I use the almost every day and I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive what was pictured. The first photo is what I was going off of - with the dark metallic browns and black. I have dark hair and those are less notable than the shiny coated ones that I received instead.  Still deciding whether to return and play another game of roulette. They function as normal though hence two stars.</li>
    <li> These clips stay in place and don&#x27;t break my hair. None of my local stores have had them in stock for a while, so it was convenient to order them online. Smooth purchase, no problems.</li>
    <li> These clips are cute and best of all, they hold my difficult, short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good find for me!!</li>
    <li> I received mine today.Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.I cant find them in the stores here anymore.they&#x27;re just the right length,2 1/2 inches,and  they don&#x27;t pull or break the hair.I&#x27;m going to order another set of them.</li>
    <li> Not what I&#x27;d hoped for. These are long, which I like - and I gave two stars for that - however, I&#x27;ve not used them once without losing three or four hairs the hard and painful way. I don&#x27;t know what it is about these, because they look like they&#x27;ll work just fine. Unfortunately due to the ouchie removal I cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> The package was clearly old and some of the paint or coating was chipped off the clips. Very disappointing but not worth the expense of returning. Flushed cash!</li>
    <li> I purchased these in a store.  Horrible little clips!  They tore out my hair every time.  When I tried to open them up a bit, they either snapped or fell out of my hair.  I threw them away, and wrote to Goody about two months ago.  They never responded.</li>
    <li> These are larger than I expected and slip from my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and very fine. These are the only clips that stay in my hair. I found one somewhere and have used it for several years. I was careful not to loose it. It was great to find these on Amazon and buy a whole pack. I really appreciate the ease of finding hard to find, needed items on Amazon. You may have to do some searching, but you&#x27;ll almost always find them.</li>
    <li> These are excellent clips which hold the hair very tightly in place and do not slip out of fine hair. I&#x27;ve found that if you take them out carefully they will not snag hair too badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the price here on Amazon, they&#x27;re WAY over priced. Walmart sells them for two dollars. They&#x27;re called Breanna Snap Clips, but have the same item number on the packaging (12304).</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair. I needed something that would hold it in place, yet don&#x27;t &#x27;stick out&#x27;. They work great, and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find these on Amazon because these are the best clips for holding my curly hair, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in stores for months. Goody must&#x27;ve changed the clips because these have a rougher surface, and end up getting caught in and pulling out my hair, not easily sliding in and out like the ones I had bough previously. I&#x27;m going to have to continue my search for good hair clips to replace the old style of these that worked so well.</li>
    <li> Best barrettes ever, but hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;I think the reviewers who said these grabbed and pulled/broke their hair are really reviewing those other snap clips that have two overlapping bits on the ends that grab strands.  Ouch!  These DO NOT have that kind of end.  In fact the end is entirely one piece.  I&#x27;ve never had these barrettes grab, pull or break my hair.  They are smooth.  I love the size as they are great for clipping my bangs back or wearing two on each side and hold a lot more hair than those 1.5 inch, grabby kind.&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve said these are crazy hard to find in Seattle.  Not sure why.  I see that Walmart carries them online, but I&#x27;ve never seen them at the Walmart in Lynnwood, or I would have bought them out.  I found them once in a CVS in Rochester and was kicking myself for not buying several packages as I seem to lose these magical and elusive barrettes.  Yay Amazon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s selg I find clips that will hold adult hair.  Most seem to be designed for children&#x27;s.  These are different .... and definitely appropriate for adult&#x27;s.  I&#x27;d purchase these again and again!</li>
    <li> These stay in place, but they tear my hair a bit when I try to carefully pull them out. Take them out with caution. Good for fine, silky hair in which clips tend to slip out.</li>
    <li> These clips will cut or pull a full strands of hair every time you take them out.  That adds up especially if you&#x27;re wearing them towards the front.  I am trying to grow my bangs out so having short little strands of hair hanging down would be very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of anyone I would recommend these clips to.</li>
    <li> I have very thick wave almost curly hair. I have been using these clips for years! They stay perfectly. I have been frantically looking for more for about 6 months as I am down to my last 2, which I watch like a hawk! I have bought prob $100 worth of other clips in hopes of finding an alternative, but nothing makes me as happy as these little gems. I ordered 3 packs in hopes of lasting a while.</li>
    <li> They just weren&#x27;t big enough, so I sent them back.</li>
    <li> good product &#x3D; using it for crafting</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay in and hair gets caught in them.</li>
    <li> I was looking for clips that work with fine hair.  These work better that most others I have found.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! If you have fine and straight hair, this is what you are looking for! Stays in no matter what! Love it</li>
    <li> They hold fairly well in my hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again though. Looking for a little shorter clips.</li>
    <li> These clips hold my hair back, and in place with the perfect amount of tension.  I found that some of the other triangular shaped clips were too loose, and slipped out of my hair.  I use 2 of these at a time, one for each side of my head.  They will not hold a huge amount of hair, like some of the older style barettes (two horizontal bar type).  You do have to be careful releasing them, or they will catch a few strands.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite hair clips!</li>
    <li> So cute and just what I needed to pin my bangs back. I have really thick hair so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for- long, thin clips. Love the assorted colors, and yes, they do pinch my hair every once in awhile, but easily, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 sets from two different sellers hoping the get a specific 1 of the 3 color varieties (looks like the pictures only show 2 colors now). I did get two different color varieties, but not the one I preferred. They work good, just wish I could pick the color.</li>
    <li> When you take them off, they pull some hairs off. I have thick voluminous hair and they don&#x27;t keep much hair up.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
    <li> I was hoping to love these because the other snap clips I own always find a way to pull out some hair. This one does too. Not worth it in my opinion.</li>
