      <li>I love this stuff, I bought it as a moisturizer for my hair</li>
      <li>I love this brand of emu oil and use it with just about anything I put on my skin.</li>
      <li>It helps the absorption of products which otherwise would just set on top of your skin.</li>
      <li>The lip balm actually has a pleasant taste, feels good on the lips and has staying power.</li>
      <li>I really had my doubts about this product being as good as some of the reviews I&#x27;d read.  </li>
      <li>This is good however it is not quite taking care of the exceptional dry skin I have this year.  </li>
      <li>I thoroughly enjoy the feeling this oil has on my skin.</li>
      <li>I use it on my skin and enjoy the feel of it.</li>
      <li>The smell is very light and can be easily over come with a drop or two of some other pleasantly scented oil.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this product because my cousin raved about it.</li>
      <li>definitely worth it !</li>
      <li>easy to apply; positive results!  </li>
      <li>I love this product and the seller has fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Within 4 months, her hairline is full of hair.</li>
      <li>A super product use it all the time</li>
      <li>now the balm that you get with these 2 bottles ( and that will last me a long time ) is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>and thank you so much for the lip balm!!</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and very well moisturized.</li>
      <li>Love this product it has helped plague psoriasis more than any other product prescription or over the counter</li>
      <li>you would think oily but in a few minutes it soaks in a talk about soft and smooth just great stuff.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very quickly on my face without leaving a oily residue and my calloused feet are so soft.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still great for hair, but I&#x27;m afraid to keep using it.</li>
      <li>Loved the chapped stick,  but this emu oil doesn&#x27;t compare to other one I have order three times!!!</li>
      <li>So when using with my essential oils, I know the essential oils are being carried deeper into the tissue for better and faster results!</li>
      <li>it really is.  </li>
      <li>Works well and the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>was very good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had it 2 days, but so far I am very pleased with it and will definitely reorder.  </li>
      <li>literally overnight your feet will be baby soft again.  very economical as only a dime-size drop will cover a saucer-size surface.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
      <li>very healing to sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly for anyone with sensitive, older skin.</li>
      <li>NATURALS NEW ZEALAND..</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin that gets irritated and itchy at the drop of a hat</li>
      <li>Now my lips feel as soft as the rest of my skin!  </li>
      <li>I love this oil, it is a catalyst to carry other ingredients deep to your skin.</li>
      <li>It has made my wrinkles less deep, and my skin more supple.</li>
      <li>Clear skin</li>
      <li>I like to use something natural like this, for my skin.  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time I ordered in June and am still using my first bottle (Aug 24).</li>
      <li>After rubbing the oil on it for 2 weeks, I pain is completely gone.</li>
      <li>It has lightened old stretch marks and darkness on neck within weeks .</li>
      <li>this is my second purchase of emu oil from Naturals of New Zealand.</li>
      <li>I usually buy the 8 oz size but wanted the free lip balm which make such a difference in my lips!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried two different brands of Emu oil from Amazon and so far this one is the winner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the improvements the next few weeks/months will bring!</li>
      <li>I wish I had know about this product when she was one year old because we went to about 3 different doctors and 2 different dermatologist, not getting the results we hoped for.</li>

    <li> i read somewhere that emu oil is a high-end salon pedicure secret...it really is.  literally overnight your feet will be baby soft again.  very economical as only a dime-size drop will cover a saucer-size surface. a freebie lip balm was included in my purchase and i have applied it nightly beyond the lip line to prevent every lady&#x27;s nightmare...lip creases!  easy to apply; positive results!  this is my second purchase of emu oil from Naturals of New Zealand. love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing skin care product</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Use it twice a day on my face and neck and spread left over on my hands. I usually buy the 8 oz size but wanted the free lip balm which make such a difference in my lips! My lips are so dry and cracked all the time and this is better than what the doctor ordered! I have recommended the emu oil and lip balm to several of my friends. No more fancy face creams for me!!!</li>
    <li> I really had my doubts about this product being as good as some of the reviews I&#x27;d read.  Well, I bought this for my granddaughter because she has eczema, mainly on her knees, and after using for about 2 weeks, the result was unbelievable.  Her knees are no longer discolored and scaly.  I love this product and will continue to order it for her.  I wish I had know about this product when she was one year old because we went to about 3 different doctors and 2 different dermatologist, not getting the results we hoped for. I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I have found for my eczema.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product because my cousin raved about it. She uses it on her hairline. She had bald edges for years. She read how emu oil could grow the hair back. Within 4 months, her hairline is full of hair. I have only been using the oil for a little over 2 weeks and of course I don&#x27;t see a change in my hairline but I have also been using it on other problem areas. I have a bad right knee. It&#x27;s painful to bend down, walk up and down stairs.....after a week of rubbing emu oil on my knee twice a day, I pain has decreased by 50 percent. I also have thumb tendonitis. After rubbing the oil on it for 2 weeks, I pain is completely gone. I apply the oil to my face and feet twice a day. It absorbs very quickly on my face without leaving a oily residue and my calloused feet are so soft.  I&#x27;m excited to see the improvements the next few weeks/months will bring!</li>
    <li> Love it! Great for your hair and skin!</li>
    <li> A super product use it all the time</li>
    <li> Loved the chapped stick,  but this emu oil doesn&#x27;t compare to other one I have order three times!!! Stick with my other oil!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this oil.  It is very nice for my skin.</li>
    <li> Works well and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> very healing to sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Only stuff I use on my face</li>
    <li> No difference to note. Basically felt it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy the feeling this oil has on my skin. I recommend it highly for anyone with sensitive, older skin. It has made my wrinkles less deep, and my skin more supple.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd order of the emu oil, and it is always excellent.  This time the Emu Oil Intensive Lip Therapy was included. I love it!  Now my lips feel as soft as the rest of my skin!  I&#x27;ve only had it 2 days, but so far I am very pleased with it and will definitely reorder.  Love these products!  01/19/2016  I continue to rave about this product!  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face and neck.  This emu oil and Retin A are perfect together.  My skin is smooth and very well moisturized. Great for knees, elbows and feet, too!</li>
    <li> excellent product.  great for skin and face</li>
    <li> Could not use on my face, made me itchy, but it works wonderful on my and my kids&#x27; hair. Love it! update: I think I&#x27;m allergic to this oil; its been 10 months and I decided to give it another try on my face and same thing happened itchy around my lips then blisters. It can&#x27;t be a coincidence so I threw it away. Yeah I don&#x27;t love it at all now, changed rating from 5 to 2 because this is painful to deal with itchy blisters. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still great for hair, but I&#x27;m afraid to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love it !! It has lightened old stretch marks and darkness on neck within weeks . It lasts a long time I ordered in June and am still using my first bottle (Aug 24).</li>
    <li> great stuff,,great price</li>
    <li> I used to buy emu oil in speaking&lt;br /&gt; Were also used mixed with other cosmetic products was very good.&lt;br /&gt; There are also getting better at manni bareuni Reggie skin.</li>
    <li> I just love this oil great on my skin you would think oily but in a few minutes it soaks in a talk about soft and smooth just great stuff.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really liked this oil. It is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I JUST LOVE THIS OIL! DID YOU HEAR ME? LOVE IT! and thank you so much for the lip balm!! this winter has been very very cold and this oil for my newly natural hair I&#x27;m just loving it! and you just need a small bit for your hair. and it arrived on time I didn&#x27;t have to wait a life time to get it! now the balm that you get with these 2 bottles ( and that will last me a long time ) is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I&#x27;m not a big fan of drinking a lot of water..but I have started to now. that means my lips were kinda dry :( but I swear since I have been using this balm.. my lips are smooth, hydrated and I must say very sexy lips:) all I need now in the mornings now is this balm and some lip liner. NATURALS NEW ZEALAND.. I WILL ONLY GET MY EMU OIL FROM YOU! good job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two different brands of Emu oil from Amazon and so far this one is the winner. I have very sensitive skin that gets irritated and itchy at the drop of a hat and this has proved just as effective as prescription creams in relieving the itch. The other one I tried didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;When all is said and done this still has some negatives. It is grease so therefore it is greasy. It also smells a lot like chicken fat. The smell is very light and can be easily over come with a drop or two of some other pleasantly scented oil. The relief it brings outweighs the negatives.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, it is a catalyst to carry other ingredients deep to your skin. It helps the absorption of products which otherwise would just set on top of your skin. A good buy!</li>
    <li> Amazing. It is unsurpassed in its healing and anti aging properties. I use a few drops on my face and rub in an upward motion once a night. Clear skin no marks just glowing complexion and confidence</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great set. I love this brand of emu oil and use it with just about anything I put on my skin. The lip balm actually has a pleasant taste, feels good on the lips and has staying power.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the seller has fast shipping. I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Awesome - love this product and fast shipping - thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I bought it as a moisturizer for my hair but I ended up using it on my eczema which covers my T-Zone area  ugh. well its cleared up most of the scare tissue from the eczema and as a bonus I now have little hairs growing where my eye brows use to be. I mean hey I am getting older and my brows start to disappear and now since 30 days have past with me using this as a moisturizer with my eczema cream once a day, I am looking good.  second order:Did this company change something, because the bottles I got in 2014 were liquid then you shake them up to mix the fat and liquid. This bottle nothing to shake the products is so thick it barely comes out of the bottle with a squeeze. this  product  feels  thick like something else is mixed in as a (filler). Not liking that at all.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me about this oil and I use it at night all over my face, neck and chest.  People have noticed a change in my skin...  I also use it on my cuticles and hair for over night conditioning.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the skin!</li>
    <li> Great for hair and skin. Never tried it for pain but I hear that it&#x27;s good for that too...</li>
