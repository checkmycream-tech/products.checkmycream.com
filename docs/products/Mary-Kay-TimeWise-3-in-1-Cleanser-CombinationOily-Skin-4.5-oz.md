<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it but won&#x27;t buy again.. too expensive</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a scary risk. I was nervous about buying 2 mary kay products online so cheap. but I was pleasantly surprised. my products came in one package so shipping was cheaper. and it came with a free mirror! this seller is amazing! I am so impressed and amazed at how quick the service was. I received my products the following week!! I will continue to buy from this seller. I go out of my way to look and see if this particular seller has other products I am interested in so I can buy from a trusted source.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of keeping acne down, but I washed with it twice a day and my skin got really dry and starting peeling.  If it wasnt for that I would have rated it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This cleanser does an excellent job with my skin type.  I recommend Mary Kay for everyday use.  Mary Kay has the secret to beautiful skin!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay skin care is a high quality, high performance product.  It does a great job cleaning and refreshing the skin all the while helping make the skin more youthful.  I have tried other products but always come back to Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Love this product!</li>
    <li> First time using the new cleanser. I like it. I love Mary Kay products, and have been using them for 30 years.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described. Very quick transaction.</li>
    <li> This a great facial cleanser. You don&#x27;t have to use much, and it makes your face feel really good - not dry at all.  It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay products for over 25 years and I like how they protect my skin. Time Wise Cleanser gently cleans away the dirt and leaves my skin soft. Adding the Mary Kay Moisturizer feels silky plus I don&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;after the washing&amp;#34; tightness.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent facial cleanser.  I have combination skin like most people.  This cleanser is effective but doesn&#x27;t overly dry out spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 19 years old tend to break out once in a while and I&#x27;ve tried neutrogena (not bad), clinique, olay, aveeeno and all kinds of moisturizers honestly this is the best one i&#x27;ve ever used I was septikal about this product because I tought people just wanted to sell sell sell but WOW WAS I WRONG THIS IS THE BEST CLEANSER my face feels happy it cleans but it also leaves my skin velvety, soft like a baby&#x27;s skin soo smooth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It might not work for everyone but it did for me! :) THANK YOU MARY KAY! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. it is so great. Lasts for a long time, so the price is super for how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for many years and I have to say this is the best by far!  No harsh chemicals, very gentle and just smooth. I look alot younger!!...I have alot of complements on my skin and it evens my tone.  This takes off all make up even stubborn eye makeup.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Great product, good price(yes it less on Amazon) and yes it is the same product. I have purchased  it through  the  Company so I can say it&#x27;s the same product.</li>
    <li> Love how this feels on my face. You only need a little at a time.</li>
    <li> Love this product it is the only one that works, I have tried dozens and have still had blemish problems.. This product is the only one that works and keeps my skin clear..</li>
    <li> Mary Kay--good product line.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser leaves face clean and removes all my makeup!</li>
    <li> Bought the Cleanser but the seller had run out of the product. Received refund immediately. I use this product and it works wonderfully. I have used several facial cleansing products, ex Clinic, Neutragena, Dermatologica... I found this one which does the best.</li>
    <li> I decided to get Mary Kay&#x27;s Timewise cleanser after I had a consultation done by a rep. The first few times I used the product my skin felt amazing. After a few I noticed that my skin felt very dry despite the fact that I used moisturizer everyday. I stopped using the product a little too late. My skin developed eczema that has spread over my face. A month and a half later, my skin is still very dry and flaky and I still have eczema. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and would never recommend this to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition. I&#x27;ve only used the product for about 2 weeks. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin yet.</li>
    <li> It works great. You need to use for a few weeks before you can see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and swear by it.  It really helps my face to be moisturized and I have no wrinkles yet.</li>
    <li> no problems with this product. It was not expired and exactly what I expected. I love this product.</li>
    <li> very easy to use,and after i use it,i feel that i look younger than before.&lt;br /&gt;and it can be used for a few months.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and it saved me :$$15</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin clean and clear, no dryness</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this product, but this is the only product that&#x27;s been able to smooth out my crazy oily/combination skin and clear up the acne and it&#x27;s not even an acne product. I&#x27;m also not a fan of MK products, but this product works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Was happy to find it at a great price!  Mary Kay products are great for your skin!</li>
    <li> Same cleanser you can buy from a rep</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. It will be old and not useful. Go to Mary Kay actual website for product worth your money.</li>
    <li> I would not use anything else on my face. The cleaner and moisturizer.... They are great!!!</li>
    <li> This is the cleanser I used forever!  It works Great:)</li>
    <li> Great Price! I have been using it for 35 years and this is the best price ever. Love it, love id.</li>
    <li> Really like this face wash and it, makes my face feel really clean after using it.  Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleanser, leaves your face clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser in combination with the moisturizer and day and night creams for over a year. My skin is combination type and I have been prone to acne since I was a teenager. I decided to start using them a few months before I got married last summer and I was looking for a perfect skin-care regimen. I have never really found products that \\&quot;work for me\\&quot; before and was feeling a little jealous of my friends who&#x27;d seemed to find their perfect products. My Mary Kay consultant found and contacted me through a bridal drawing I had won (how random!) and within a month or so of using these products I was already getting several compliments on my complexion (I still can&#x27;t believe it, that has never ever happened in my life before!). I use the cleanser on a daily basis and it does not dry my skin out. I control for mild acne (it always happens around that time of the month!) with another product that is not Mary Kay - I have not tried the MK Acne Gel - but my skin really never looked this good in the days before I started using it. I&#x27;m sure it would look at its best all the time if I would only remember to use the day and night cream with as much vigilance as I use the cleanser! It&#x27;s hard to use it consistently when I work graveyard shifts! I am, however, very, very pleased with the Mary Kay products I have tried!</li>
    <li> The product was on time but the box was sort of mangled.</li>
    <li> i have use mary kay products since 30 years ago. time wise put them better tah ever. thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I love this line of mary kay products, it is easy on my skin and leaves it fresh and clean without drying it out!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great for sensitive and acne prone skin. Ive used thousands of dollars on other store bought cleansers and nothing can compare to how smooth,  soft and clear my face has become.  I began to notice an difference after a few days. This is great when paired with the combination/oily face Lotion.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and swear by it. It really helps my face to be moisturized and I have no wrinkles ye</li>
    <li> i accidnetally chanced upon Mary Kay products and have been hooked to the brand since 2009. i can&#x27;t do without this product - always re-order half way through</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have very oily skin and it does everything in one washing.</li>
    <li> The cleanser was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have mild to severe rosacea. It didn&#x27;t clear it up, but it is very gentle. It doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes. I recommend this to those with good skin.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be a bit grittier. It&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> I will get a representative because buying products like this on line  You don&#x27;t know if they used it before for a class or anything.  This one didn&#x27;t have enough cleanser in it.  It&#x27;s not as full like the ones that I had actually brought from a face to face rep. Mary Kay rep.  Will not do this again.</li>
    <li> I use to have really oily skin on the T-zone area.  Over the years since I have been using this, I feel like I know longer have oily skin.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I have oily/acne skin as an adult. I have tried other numerous cleansers of all different brands, and I have found Marykay products work best for my skin. This really removes my makeup, is non-drying, and my skin feels refreshed.</li>
    <li> Everything went smoothly and I got what I paid for. I&#x27;m not sure why these reviews have to be so long.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see my favorite Mary Kay products offered on Amazon ! This cleanser makes my skin look &amp; feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible.  I guess it works fine. Nothing impressive but I have to hold my breath as I am washing my face.  It smells like white glue mixed with car grease.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have a very oily face with mart kay its controls it very good i love mary kay by  I also used the cream day/night and all the make up , by the way this seller is great and fast shipping i will order agein soon!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay. My favorite cleanser by far. Love the pricing too. Much cheapper here than ordering from a rep</li>
    <li> While I typically LOVE Mary Kay products, this particular cleanser/moisturizer from Timewise has a strange &#x27;chemical&#x27; smell to it ... I&#x27;m surprised no one else has commented on this.  Also, doesn&#x27;t work well for more acne-prone skin types.  My skin is combo with occasional breakouts.  I recently made the switch from Velocity to Timewise and my skin has had more breakouts since I switched than ever before.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay and have used this product in the past... and I loved it! This product smells like wet dog when I wash my face with it. Disappointing to me...</li>
    <li> It arrived as promised, was new in the package as promised.I have used this product for years and paid more for it. This was great.</li>
    <li> To whom this may concern. I found all my items on there but the cost of Shipping &amp; Handling was horrible..How can one be charged $4.95 each item and on one item I paid as much as if I had bought it from the company. My Bella cologne was horrible.Smell is short term and It seems watered down.  Sincerely  Joyce Anderson</li>
    <li> Mary Kay has good products and I found this cleanser does the job.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of switching from this to African Black Soap and suffered horrible breakouts which lead to scarring. :( I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will stick with Mary Kay. It controls the oil in my skin and the breakouts better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This item came quickly and new. My skin feels clean after each use and I have had any problems with acne since Ive started using this product. Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to become very dehydrated during the winter, which was when I bought this product. For the first few days it was fine. I noticed that my skin became a little dry but I stuck with it. Eventually my skin started to peel on and around my nose and around my mouth and no matter how much or how many times I applied the moisturizer, it wouldn&#x27;t go away. I used this for about a month and even after I stopped using I still have problems with my face drying out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone that gets dehydrated skin. Never ever.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser it makes your skin feel clean but not stripped.</li>
    <li> Soooo excited that I don&#x27;t have to hassle with bugging my local Mary Kay ladies!!!</li>
    <li> I use MK timewise cleanser for combination to oily skin in the shower every day. I like the gel type texture with the beads that burst when rubbed onto my face. I also like how my face feels after I rinse it off. Sometimes I apply it to my neck and chest if they are feeling oily. It works wonders!</li>
    <li> Love the cleanser! I have sued this for years and love it. Anyone who has oily skin should try this.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay products don&#x27;t irratate my skin and leaves it fresh and soft. I have super sensitive skin so I have to be extra careful about which products to use, even &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; products leaves my skin feeling terrible.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser.  It removes makeup well even eye makeup.  I don&#x27;t like to run out of it and try to reorder often.  Mary Kay has been around for decades and in general they make good products.  I am not endorsing MK nor do I sell their products.  I would recommend this cleanser for makeup removal.  I usually follow up with another line of products but I find this works best if you like to take off your makeup or oil and dirt before you use another product.</li>
    <li> Great for my acne prone and sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Great product been using it for years.</li>
    <li> AMAZING. use this. youre face will clear up within a week. I love this product</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used this cleanser formula in awhile, but I think I love it better than my normal one. It makes your skin feel very clean. Delivery on this product was very fast!</li>
    <li> I think this cleanser is the best among mary kay stuff. I use this stuff every morning and night. I never use cleansing cream. Just using this cleanser you never worry about cleansing the make up. It is very soft gel and you will cleansing your make up by using a few amount of them</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for many years and  will  use it for many years to come. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it daily and it keeps my face looking fresh and with a glow. Easy cleansing. Not harsh.</li>
    <li> Always use this product!</li>
    <li> Great facial wash - I don&#x27;t buy anything else to clean my face</li>
    <li> Great over all product</li>
    <li> Love this face wash!!</li>
    <li> It is almost embarassing to say that I ordered the Mary Kay TimeWise 3-in-1 Cleanser by accident thinking it was the moisturizer. I am glad it was an accident because I&#x27;ve completely forgotten about how this cleanser makes your skin feel! My pores are tighter, skin is smoother, and in essence, I feel as though I&#x27;ve got baby skin again! The feeling right after use is amazing...so clean like it&#x27;s pulled all of the dirt and oil from my face and softened it at the same time! I love Mary Kay! This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> NOTE: Not recommended for the eye area.   This cleanser removes heavy makeup and does a great job removing dirt in pores. Perfect for those looking for an all-in-one cleanser.    It is creamy with small pink beads in it. You rub it on face and wipe it off with a warm cloth. That is it! Your face is clean!</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff for OILY SKIN</li>
    <li> I had bad ance for about a year and I tried a few things but they never worked! Finally I tried this and I love it! It&#x27;s also removing my dark spots now, and I only been using it for less than 2 months. I for sure recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Im obsessed! I never breakout. And it makes my skin feel clean and smooth. It is the only product I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin yet deep cleans your pores.</li>
    <li> Love this product use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old and I always get compliments on my skin.  I&#x27;m not brand loyal and have used just about every kind of scrub on the market. It&#x27;s been over a year since I started using the Mary Kay and I love it!  I use it gently around my eye area with my fingers and then I put some on a cotton pad and scrub my face, neck and hairline area with a little more vigor.....both morning and night.  An easy way to see how well this product works is to use it on one arm and another scrub on the other arm for a week or so.  You won&#x27;t believe the difference in the texture of your skin and on how smoothly your lotions apply.  It&#x27;s more expensive than other products but lasts twice as long.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Price: 5 stars * Fair * Way much cheaper on amazon vs buying on mary kay online no offense&lt;br /&gt;Oil control:  4 stars&lt;br /&gt;tight dry feeling?: None&lt;br /&gt;Break outs: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product since I have very sensitive skin with a bit of oily skin, I finally found product to help my problem. I&#x27;m not old enough to use anti-aging products.. I Just use sunblock...</li>
    <li> I love this product. It helps keep you looking youthful. Highly recommend this</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and i&#x27;ve tried many skin care products for sensitive skin. This product seems to work great on my skin and it feels so soft after washing my face. It&#x27;s not greasy or too drying like cheap cleansers I had tried before realizing how picky and sensitive my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took one star off is because it was surprising that it did not have protective seal or cap when I first opened it.&lt;br /&gt;Usually cosmetics have protective seals or caps to prevent possible contamination. But it didn&#x27;t have one. so I was wondering it the seller sent me an opened item for testing or it is natural from the manufacture. Well.... I don&#x27;t know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I love the Mary Kay Timewise 3-in-1.  My skin feels clean after using it.  I love the way this product lathers, unlike the normal to dry where you are not sure if your face is clean.</li>
    <li> I (better yet my skin)I really like this product.. My normally oily skin seems to me better controlled. I sometimes get  small dry spots at the corners of my mouth/ cheeks during colder months so I&#x27;ll back off using a little. overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> Best cleanser for sensitive skin. Even though this cleanser is in the timewise line, I&#x27;m 23yrs old and I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser since I was 19 yrs old. This is the only cleanser that have worked for my combo/oily sensitive skin. This cleanser leaves my face clean w/o drying it out and It leaves my face feeling tight (like a  peel which I like). It has no smell and it has these little beads for light exfoliating(not harsh). I have been using this cleanser for 5 yrs now, in between I have used other cleanser because of change of climate, hormones etc, but I have always came back to using this cleanser. Love it!</li>
    <li> I live by this product especially since all your facial products is combined (cleanser, freshener and moisturizer).  It saves time in my morning rush for work.</li>
    <li> I have always had an oily complexion. Mary Kay has balanced that. I feel cleansed after I use it. Also the lotions for after cleansing are great. I use Mary Kay microderm abrasion wash. That really exfoliates the dead skin.</li>
    <li> Love it will order again</li>
    <li> Delivery took a little longer than I would have liked but excellent price and product.</li>
    <li> Love it and it came quick</li>
    <li> You can use a pea sized drop and it will be enough to wash your whole face and more.  I love this face wash</li>
    <li> Great all in 1 option. Sometimes I still use freshner. Mary Kay is a name I trust. Glad I don&#x27;t have to find a rep for area to find products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never let down when it comes to Mary Kay products! Thanks for the great prices! My skin is already looking better.</li>
    <li> everything by mary kay is really good quality and that includes this cleanser light and non abrasive.</li>
    <li> I love MK Timewise products and don&#x27;t really know what I did before using them. I really don&#x27;t think there is another product out there that I would use.</li>
    <li> Reel good. I recommend to my friend and family. I am pleased with the resultats because my skin seems really heathy now.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff around.  worth the extra money. Lasts a very long time.  I recommend this particular product</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that removes makeup quickly and skin looks clean. All you need is two dime size applications and water and all you can see your makeup wash away!</li>
    <li> Great product! I love it! :O) I have used this for years and loooove it! :O) I don;t use any other Mary Kay products so I am an unbiased customer.</li>
    <li> Outside the price being pretty steep on these types of cleansers, they do a good job for me.  It is much better than soap on the skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give this any stars but .... I work out &amp; sweat a lot and this cleanser doesn&#x27;t do anything to help me not break out! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I look like I have teenage acne</li>
    <li> Works just like if I bought it from a Mary Kay salesperson. Now I can skip meeting with someone and just have it delivered to my door. Not a bad price either.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cleanser on the market.  I have been using it for years, and whenever I try something new I regret it and go back to this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I feel refreshed after using this product.</li>
    <li> This face wash is the best. It is usually a splurge considering it is more expensive than my normal drugstore face wash, but it is well worth the price. Several months ago my face started breaking out, even though I was using a facescrub that is frequently advertised on TV to prevent breakouts. I decided to fork out the money for the Mary Kay TimeWise face wash, and the bottle has lasted me 4 months. Only now do I need a replacement. Money is tight right now with a child in daycare, but this is one item that is worth the cost! Especially when it lasts so long! I love it!</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay products! I have been using this line for years and still works the best for my combo skin type.. acne prone.</li>
    <li> Controls break outs and my skin is soft.</li>
    <li> I gave Mary Kay Timewise 3-in-1 Cleanser -Combination to Oily Skin a 5 star rating because this product has just enough cleansing power not to strip natural oils.</li>
    <li> Have used this cleanser for years and find that it goes a long ways and does what Mary Kay claims it will--cleans the face and does a mild exfoliation each time you cleanse.</li>
    <li> My skin is like butter after using this.  I temporarily went back to my Proactiv routine and then to a new face wash by MK that had a toner in it.  Still, this is my fave.</li>
    <li> price was awesome delivery was great</li>
    <li> Hi; I am A  black Woman and I love the 3-in1 Clear  I have ben clear for over 5 year and is good for black Women&lt;br /&gt;My name is Mrs. Terry K. McNeel</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a face wash without salicylic acid in it. I have been using this face wash for several years and it removes make up very well without leaving my skin feeling dry. My usual mary kay contact stopped selling and I was delighted to find that I could purchase it with amazon prime!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great item!</li>
    <li> I bought this product before from a Mary Kay rep. Granted,it was a while ago but I don&#x27;t remember it smelling like this. Product has an odd mildew-like smell to it. Other than that it works fine and it shipped quicker than expected</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have always been pleased with it. My skin is oily in spots and dry in others, and this cleanser works well - I did have an acne problem before I started this product, and I haven&#x27;t been bothered with breakouts in years.</li>
    <li> Great product! Item arrived in 2 days after order&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the face.</li>
    <li> It feels nice when applying to face, leaving it residual free &amp; feeling soft &amp; clean</li>
    <li> Very happy with this cleanser, does a good job and I like that it is a 3-in-1 process. The tube is handy for traveling also. I have  always been a fan of Mary Kay products!!!</li>
    <li> The product was packaged and still in original box, but when used, it was not the correct cleanser in the bottle. I was cheated!</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay&#x27;s 3-in-1 cleanser for (comb/oily skin).  It doesn&#x27;t dry your face out too much, and helps to gently exfoliate your face.  If you&#x27;re skin is starting to show signs of fine lines and wrinkles, this is a great product to use.</li>
    <li> I have used these products for nearly 40 years.  That is all I need to say.</li>
    <li> Makes my face greasier</li>
    <li> As promised! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I have sensitive skin and have been prone to adult acne, but have noticed fewer flare-ups.  A little goes a long way, especially if you use a facial sponge.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin but this products makes my face too dry. The one dry to normal is much better for all types of skin, I tried it before and leave my face in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for years. I love it. I have dandruff on my forehead and my face gets pretty greasy. This face wash, as well as the moisturizer I also use, keep my face looking clean and the dandruff at bay. Use it on a regular, daily basis for the best results though. If I skip a day or two then my problems come back.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!  Love this product I have been using it for years.  Its the only thing that does not make my face have an allergic reaction</li>
    <li> This help to get all of my make-up off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product it leaves my skin feeling soft and looking health. Also the product arrived it great condition and on time.</li>
    <li> I was sent a different product. I ordered Mary kay cosmetics 3 in 1 time wise  I ran out so since I order from Amazon and mostly their products are great but this is not the product I ordered its a gel and real MK is white creamy like paste. I don&#x27;t like this gel. Please sent my real MK cosmetics thanks</li>
    <li> REALLY LIKE HOWIT FEELS ON THE SKIN DURING THE SCRUB OF MY FACE</li>
    <li> It is ILLEGAL to sell MARY KAY on AMAZON! Violates the consultant agreement and MK is cracking down on this. Sued women doing the same thing on ebay and was awarded damages. Id get this off of here asap.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay&#x27;s Timewise 3-in-1 Cleasnser is awesome!  My skin is combination of dry and oily.  This also smells great and does not have a heavy smell.</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly and arrived quickly. Brand new in box. Product works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Will definetly reorder.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is a great face cleanser. It is gentle on my face unlike other cleansers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this MK product for years and I love it! It&#x27;s the only face wash that removes my make up without the oily feel afterward. I will never buy anything else! :)</li>
    <li> Mary Kay never fails. I have been using Mary Kay cleansing products over the past several years. I hardly breakout using her products. I spent a lot of money on other products that hardly worked for me. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love the feel after cleansing!</li>
