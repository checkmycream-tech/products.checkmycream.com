      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
      <li>The instructions say bright and ddark colors need special washing.</li>

      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone :)</li>
      <li>I love mine, and bought one as a Xmas gift for a co-worker.</li>
      <li>May not be the most glamourous looking thing</li>
      <li>the more often you wash it.</li>
      <li>I love using it when I take a bath, to wash my face, just to keep my hair out of my face, and to put my makeup on.</li>
      <li>It’s so much better than a ponytail holder, which leaves creases in my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really cute</li>
      <li>this holds it back perfectly in the shower.</li>
      <li>and I like using better than a headband when applying makeup or washing my face.  </li>
      <li>Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I received my first one as a gift and love this!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to store -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for holding hair back while washing your face, Doing a face Mask or putting on makeup in the morning.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
      <li>I gave them 3 stars because the idea is still great and the Tassi still works during its limited life span.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, stays right at the hairline and doesn&#x27;t mess my hairstyle or bangs up.  </li>
      <li>I have above the shoulder cut and my hair is very fine</li>
      <li>The elastic wears out pretty quick, it seems like much quicker</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve wanted a Tassi for quite sometime, and actually received one for Christmas :)</li>
      <li>Despite those issues, I really appreciate how useful it is and will continue to buy them a couple times a year if that’s what it takes.</li>
      <li>perfect for short hair that hangs in your face when you wash your face, but is too short to pull back in a pony tail.</li>
      <li>Although this is easier with two hands (as many things are), it is totally doable with one hand.  </li>
      <li>and I went back to get some more</li>
      <li>The quality of Tassi has really declined since they first came out.  </li>
      <li>I never knew how much time and energy</li>
      <li>Even when I have my hair all made up ready for the day</li>
      <li>My granddaughter and I both use these head wraps and they work very well for us.</li>
      <li>My mom and I bought some of these handy hair holders a few years ago.</li>
      <li>Also lasts a long time and easily washed.</li>
      <li>But I still love it because it&#x27;s a lot easier to put on and less cumbersome than wrapping your head in a towel</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It works so much better than a plain hairband for keeping hair out of the way.</li>
      <li>My only concern is that I think it might not work for very heavy, ethnic or long hair because my hair seems to be a nice fit.</li>
      <li>My hair is relatively short and I didn&#x27;t really think it would benefit me that much.</li>
      <li>, this does not destroy my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>so find this useful by putting it on under a shower cap to prevent hair that would otherwise pop out, from getting wet.</li>
      <li>I just bought two new ones (to replace my old original ones that had held up for 3+ years and some newer ones that lasted less than a year) and these new Tassis will be my last ones.  </li>
      <li>It keeps all the hair out of my way - I&#x27;ve used it when my hair was long and also when it was super short.  </li>
      <li>But I was thinking of ordering one for each of my nieces who both have very long hair, so I decided to try one first to see how if it might help them when they take their baths, etc.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s my fault for washing them on hot which killed the elastic.</li>

<li> My other concern is laundering.</li>
<li> wish I could give this 5 stars, but unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
<li> I will wash my new one cold and see if that helps it last longer.</li>
<li> It goes on just like a headband, but then I tuck my hair into the little pouch that forms between the two elastic bands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I do like it.</li>
<li> My mom washes hers once every few weeks and hers lasts her about 4-5 months.</li>
<li> Keeping even the small strays out-of-the-way.</li>
<li> I have very thick hair</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money because elastic goes bad after 2 washes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great for washing my face in the evenings when I don&#x27;t want to get my hair went. Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying to find something to keep the hair out of my face when I&#x27;m washing my face at night.  I have short hair and plastic head bands don&#x27;t work and fabric headbands just shrink off the back of my head when washing.  By the time I&#x27;m through - my hair is soaked.  I saw this on TV and figured, why not?  It&#x27;s great, stays right at the hairline and doesn&#x27;t mess my hairstyle or bangs up.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It is just the trick for taking off and putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> This thing actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  It&#x27;s really cute and I like using better than a headband when applying makeup or washing my face.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I do like it.</li>
    <li> If you have long hair that falls in your face even when pulled back (when washing your face) - you need this. Doesn&#x27;t flatten your hair. May not be the most glamourous looking thing but it&#x27;s just to be used at home, so no worries. I love mine, and bought one as a Xmas gift for a co-worker.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter and I both use these head wraps and they work very well for us.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on my head and my hair gets wet.  It needs to be tighter.  I would not recommend it to others to buy.</li>
    <li> I needed a way to keep my hair out of my face to wash and remove make-up. I have above the shoulder cut and my hair is very fine and it is too short to pull into a ponytail. I was happy to find the Tassi on Amazon. My only concern is that I think it might not work for very heavy, ethnic or long hair because my hair seems to be a nice fit. My other concern is laundering. The instructions say bright and ddark colors need special washing.</li>
    <li> Love the Tassi!  A friend gave this to me last year when my shoulder was messed up and I couldn&#x27;t use both hands to get my hair out of the way when taking a bath or washing my face.  Although this is easier with two hands (as many things are), it is totally doable with one hand.  I use it in the tub to keep my hair up and dry, to wash my face, putting on makeup, and putting facial masks on.  It keeps all the hair out of my way - I&#x27;ve used it when my hair was long and also when it was super short.  It works so much better than a plain hairband for keeping hair out of the way.</li>
    <li> I received my first one as a gift and love this! I have very thick hair so find this useful by putting it on under a shower cap to prevent hair that would otherwise pop out, from getting wet. I&#x27;m on my 2nd and picked up a 3rd as a spare because it was on sale.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, almost down to my butt, and this works at holding it all in when I wash my face. Even when I have my hair all made up ready for the day, this does not destroy my &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a Tassi for quite sometime, and actually received one for Christmas :) It&#x27;s wonderful! I have shorter hair (over my shoulders) and it works wonders. I love using it when I take a bath, to wash my face, just to keep my hair out of my face, and to put my makeup on. It&#x27;s very, very comfortable - not too snug, but not too lose either. I would recommend this product to anyone :) I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing another one sometime in the future!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money because elastic goes bad after 2 washes</li>
    <li> I toyed for a long time on whether or not to order this product. My hair is relatively short and I didn&#x27;t really think it would benefit me that much. But I was thinking of ordering one for each of my nieces who both have very long hair, so I decided to try one first to see how if it might help them when they take their baths, etc. I love it! I wear it every morning before I dry my hair to apply my makeup and then again when I get home at night to take my makeup off. It&#x27;s so easy to use! I never knew how much time and energy I spent keeping my hair off of my fact to apply moisturizers and makeup. This is an awesome product and I will be ordering one for each of my nieces!</li>
    <li> I have ordered 3 of these. I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long. I saw these on a blog site and had to try. I use then twice a day for my long hair. It&#x27;s great for holding hair back while washing your face, Doing a face Mask or putting on makeup in the morning. Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> I am a Tassi customer for life! They work awesome to keep your hair out of the way while washing your face. I bought two of them a couple of years ago and just had to replace them. I think it&#x27;s my fault for washing them on hot which killed the elastic. I will wash my new one cold and see if that helps it last longer.</li>
    <li> The quality of Tassi has really declined since they first came out.  I just bought two new ones (to replace my old original ones that had held up for 3+ years and some newer ones that lasted less than a year) and these new Tassis will be my last ones.  The elastic is the cheapest elastic on earth, and sizing is totally inconsistent between Tassis of the same size.  My washing advice is to wash and line dry - the dryer will completely ruin the cheap elastic and you will have the pleasure of throwing out your useless Tassi.  I gave them 3 stars because the idea is still great and the Tassi still works during its limited life span.</li>
    <li> I love these things! I&#x27;m going to order more as they are great for facials and make up application.. Keeping even the small strays out-of-the-way. Great for gifting too!</li>
    <li> Truth be told, this basically serving the same function as wrapping a towel around your head or tying your hair back. But I still love it because it&#x27;s a lot easier to put on and less cumbersome than wrapping your head in a towel and it won&#x27;t leave a dent in your hair like a hair tie. Also the way you pull it across you head (like a head band) means it&#x27;s easier to trap/collect all you hair in one go. It&#x27;s also easy to store - I just hang it on a hook by the shower in between washes.</li>
    <li> My mom and I bought some of these handy hair holders a few years ago. I wash my hair every other day, so on the days I don’t wash my hair this holds it back perfectly in the shower. Then when I do my makeup it I use it to hold my hair out of my face. It’s so much better than a ponytail holder, which leaves creases in my hair. It goes on just like a headband, but then I tuck my hair into the little pouch that forms between the two elastic bands.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give this 5 stars, but unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t last long enough. The elastic wears out pretty quick, it seems like much quicker the more often you wash it. My mom washes hers once every few weeks and hers lasts her about 4-5 months. I wash mine about once every 2 months and mine lasts about 9 months. I wash mine in a delicates bag so it doesn&#x27;t get stretched around other items and then I air dry it. It also seems priced a little high for what it is, which is basically two elastic headbands with terry cloth stretched between them. Despite those issues, I really appreciate how useful it is and will continue to buy them a couple times a year if that’s what it takes.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!! perfect for short hair that hangs in your face when you wash your face, but is too short to pull back in a pony tail. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I found these in a store and I went back to get some more and they were out. I was so happy to find them here. They work great and are comfortable. Arrived quickly. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product for when you are washing your face &amp; need your hair away from your face. Also lasts a long time and easily washed.</li>
