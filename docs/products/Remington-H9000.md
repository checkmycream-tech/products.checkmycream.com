      <li>I can&#x27;t swear they&#x27;ll work as well for all hair types and styles as they do for mine, but these are so perfect for me I&#x27;m tempted to buy another set in case they ever stop making them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As a long time user (over 30 years) of hot rollers I have to say I was quite disappointed in this set. Do they heat as advertised? Yes. But..lol the clip does not hold the cuter very tightly so the curlers flop around on my head. The old fashioned pins hold the curler tight, no movement at all.  I also felt the curlers made my hair more frizzle. I used them for a week giving them a fair try, but now they have been put away and now I&#x27;m back to using my old set again.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly; lots of large rollers; exactly what I needed for my shoulder-length fine hair! Good price as well!</li>
    <li> Great product. I have two sets of these for my hair. Use them weekly</li>
    <li> I thought this would work for my hair because of the clips but they would not stay in my hair.  However, I gave the set to my long-haired daughter-in-law and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t work on shorter hair but works fine on long.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers about a year ago.  They work fine to make curls, but the clips don&#x27;t hold well and they leave funny creases in my hair.  I would have to go over the creases with my curling iron, which makes for twice the work!  The rollers ended up in storage.    I would like to be able to use them so, today I am shopping for replacement wire clips from another manufacturer to use with this set.  It&#x27;s either that or buy a whole new set of rollers.</li>
    <li> I am a Professional Hairstylist and Makeup Artist who does several weddings a week. I live in the #1 wedding destination spot in the continental US. I swear by these rollers!!! They get very nice and hot, and the velvet on the rollers makes it easy to start the wrap around the hair. The create a beautiful, lasting curl (used in conjunction with a good flexible hairspray, lightly sprayed on the dry strip of hair and then combed through). I live in a VERY humid climate, so these things are miracle workers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips included with this set are great for the back of the head, but around the face I use the Conair Salon Pro Clips (these things are amazing!), to be certain there are no marks of indentation. (The clips with the set are a great concept, but do make a mark if the hair isn&#x27;t over-directed before placing the roller. Remington should really think about redesigning them to resemble the salon pro clips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have brought other sets, only because they looked more \\&quot;professional\\&quot; and take up less space. I figured if they cost $100 (and up) they MUST be better. NOT so much! These other sets performance paled in comparison. I have had SO many people say this set has held a curl better than any other they have tried. I currently have 2 sets. One is a few years old and starting to lose the super-heat, but I use these things MUCH more than the average person, sometimes needing it to be hot for hours on end. For the results, and $30 some-odd bucks, I&#x27;ll keep buying them until Remington no longer makes them. I just ordered another brands $80 set to try them out, but I have a pretty good feeling I&#x27;ll be returning them for another set of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not someone working for this company, I swear! I have gone through SO many roller sets in my life, and I use them A LOT. I am so impressed with these. Remington needs to make a stand-up version so I can fit them on my station!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET THESE- but def get the Conair clips too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: I have experienced that the first few sessions with these rollers are not as hot. These need to be \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;. After a few uses, they will get more hot. This is common with many heat elements, they need to slowly reach the maximum heat to ensure a long life. )</li>
    <li> The rollers are cheap, made out of plastic and are NOT ceramic as claimed. The clips are a cheap plastic that melt when heated. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money. This is not what was advertised. Cheap. And your curls are brushed right off after 30 mins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and this is awesome because I can set my hair with this while I do my make up and then when I&#x27;m done I take it out. Only complaint is that one broke within the first week and my hair gets caught in the slit and pulls but other then that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My hair stays curly all day!</li>
    <li> I have used three types so far- conair hot rollers xtreme, conair ion and remington pearl.    The xtreme curlers from Conair XTREME get hotter but that means that they are not as easy to manage with your hands as the Remington or the Conair ION.    The Remington Pearl have heated clips all at once whereas the Xtreme roller clips can only be heated three at a time. **This isnt necessarily bad because many roller sets like Conair Ion have no heated clips at all, but nevertheless it works great.**-I&#x27;ve tried it.    The REMY gave a very nice set/curl the only drawback being there are only eight medium rollers and the rest large. **There are no small rollers as with both of the conair sets.</li>
    <li> I just used these for the first time. I was considering buying a $100 set from Sephora but I thought I&#x27;d give these a try first. I let them heat up for about 15 minutes. I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a few days, which I hear is supposed to help your hair hold the curl. I put them in and sat around for about 10-15 minutes (box says to wait 5). Nothing. Barely  even a wave. I&#x27;m no hair stylist or expert, and maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but I&#x27;m taking them back.</li>
    <li> I received these as a gift for Christmas, I like how there are 20 rollers and I like the clips that hold the rollers in place they are much better then the pins the other rollers use.  These rollers are small so you cannot roll much of your hair on them at once, so it is good their are a lot of rollers.  These rollers heat very fast and are easy to use and the clips keep the roller in your hair in place.  Since these rollers heat fast they seem to also cool fast too, making styling my hair very fast, which that is a plus.  The case for these rollers is quite large so you need to have room where ever your going to place them to heat, they do not have a shut off switch so to turn them on you need to plug them in and to turn them off you unplug them.</li>
    <li> I like how fast it curls BUT my hair is fine and the clips will not hold my hair well, especially when I put the roller sideways. I have shoulder length hair and shorter layers on the crown so the Large curls the top hair too much. They need to make them with Jumbo rollers, at least 3 of them.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;awsome\\&quot;. ITEM WORKS WONDERS..WAS A GIFT FOR MY BFF SHE LOVES THEM .IF YOU LIKE HOT ROLLERS THIS ITEM IS THE WAY TO GO</li>
    <li> The entire case is a little large but that did not bother me.  The clips that come with the set don&#x27;t work as well as I would like.  They stay when placed on curlers that are on the top of my head, the ones on the side just slip right off.  I had a few larger plastic goody brand hair clips that I just decided to use for the side pieces and my hair still curls nicely.</li>
    <li> heats up very quickly</li>
    <li> Heat up to a good temperature, I&#x27;m still teaching myself how to use them but so far I like it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these hot rollers.  Clips would not hold roller in hair, even the largest  roller made my hair too curly, in a short few minutes.  I was out of town with family member, for heart surgery, I tried  these rollers when I returned home, It was past 30 days when I  got to try them, too late for return. Saw these in one of my magazines and thought they would make soft loose waves in my hair. A waste of my money and time. Out in the trash they go!</li>
    <li> I have used these rollers for a week and am moving them to my storage closet and buying a different set.  They heat up quickly but get VERY hot.  Felt like my scalp was burning in some spots - wondered what it was doing to my fine hair!  The clips are poorly designed.  They leave ridges at the base of the curl.  And finally, the unit itself is awkwardly large and it takes extra time to put each roller back on the rod exactly as it should be.  This hairsetter will create nice curls but for me the negatives were too many.</li>
    <li> I love this...i was using a curling iron but this takes minutes to set my whole head and the curls are so soft and smooth.  I will buy another when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> The clips on the top row melted!  Sending back!</li>
    <li> These rollers are really easy to use and make a nice curl. My hair has grown since I bought them and now they&#x27;re a little too small, but I still use them from time to time.</li>
    <li> Bought these from Ulta.  The clips don&#x27;t hold the curls to your scalp and they melted.</li>
    <li> The rollers are smooth. I wanted them to be &#x27;spiked&#x27; so that they grip the hair better. The clamps caused ridges in my hair when removed.</li>
    <li> I had anxiety at first, to spend so much money on a product through the mail. But I was very relieved when I got them. They heat up fast and really put some bounce in my flat hair. The rollers come in two different sizes, 8 small and 12 large. The heated clips are perfect for adding lift at the root of the hair, it made my hair have lots of volume. With the ceramic it literally took the static right out of my hair.    I have used them several times now and I am happy with the results of my hair - every single time. Best investment I ever made.</li>
    <li> I have had this set of rollers for about 3 months now and I LOOOVE them! I have very long (my longest layer is to my waste, all natural)and very thick hair. I never thought these would work in my hair. I purchased them from Target for about $34 and I have not regrettted it. It takes about 10-15 mins for me to put the curlers in. I do use a heat protectant. I usually set the curlers and then do my makeup.. and by the time I&#x27;m finshed putting my makeup on it&#x27;s time to take out the curlers. Everytime that I use the curlers I get so many compliments. What a great product!</li>
    <li> I have medium thick hair and my hair holds a curl pretty well with a curling iron but these do not get hot enough and the curl does not last.  I sent the rollers back!  I think they will work on thin hair maybe!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THE CONAIR CHAMPION SALON PRO ROLLER CLIPS TO GO WITH THESE VELVETY SMOOTH ROLLERS?.....THESE ROLLERS STAY IN PLACE, AND DO NOT SLIDE OUT! NO MATTER WHAT!&lt;br /&gt;AND I TRIED! I HAVE LONG HAIR TO MY WAIST!</li>
    <li> Bought these when i moved from europe to the US. Read a few good reviews and got them however they are horrible. I used it maybe 3 times and they&#x27;re MELTING!!! The clips also have no grip so they pop off even if you use only a little hair in them. I am returning them and will hopefully find a decent pair like my last with clips that actually grip your hair! DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had to review this product. I was a little afraid to buy it, considering the reviews but I took a chance and am so happy. These rollers were on the rack for about five minutes and in my hair for about the same time. When I took them out I had perfect ringlet curls! The rollers were not too hot to touch. I paid 30 dollars for them on amazon.com and I am thrilled with the product. I recommend these! If it helps I have layered hair that comes just below my shoulder blades and I am african american. I just blow dry my hair, leave it a bit damp, put chi heat protector spray on and roll my hair up. These are perfect! Plus the clips hold well and they dont feel heavy in my hair. The fact that the clips are pink is a plus.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers, they heat up fast and the clips help them stay in while I am still getting ready.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly thick, course, and long hair---the triple threat to any form of set curl. So, I am quite happy with this set, since it will literally hold my curls for days. There is one problem however: the instructions. Both the box and instructions say that the rollers are ready in 45 seconds. This is absolutely not true. They need about 3 full minutes to heat up properly to hold a curl. Secondly, the box says that it will curl in 5 min. Again, not true. You might have a curl, but it will fall immediately after. Keep them in for 15-20 full minutes for thick hair, 10 for thinner, and you&#x27;re set. Otherwise, I absolutely love this roller set. They are the proper size for volume+curl. If you&#x27;re looking for just volume, these are too small. They create more of a loose spiral, and when brushed out, a beachy wave. So, basically, the set is fantastic as long as you don&#x27;t get wrapped up in the \\&quot;fast\\&quot; time clause on the box. It&#x27;s the normal roller process with great, lasting results.</li>
    <li> The clips pop off easily and the curlers are cheap.  If the rollers are not placed just so in the crate, they will melt.  What horrible engineering, I mean they are \\&quot;hot\\&quot; rollers they should withstand heat without melting.  Don&#x27;t purchase-save your money.  I am on Amazon now to shop for a replacement.  Trust me-don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using hot rollers for over 40 years(not my husband Rod) and these are a great concept HOWEVER they don&#x27;t really curl your hair as they should.  Mine are going straight back. I used it on me and my two daughters and we all felt that they were worthless. I rolled each of our hair differently and still the same results, only waves. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Thank You! I am enjoying my new rollers, easy and quick to use! perfect if you are short on time and need to look good.</li>
    <li> used once.........have them but will make contribution</li>
    <li> I love the fact that there are 20 med sized and small rollers in this set. It&#x27;s convenient having so many rollers to use at one heating. The hair rolls easily over the soft covering and they are hot. The clips that hold the rollers on are also hot and make the heating process faster. The only problem and this is a real problem is that the clips don&#x27;t hold the rollers in place. I have to use different claw type holders instead.</li>
    <li> I needed something other than a high-temperature curling iron. I specifically wanted a set with clips, rather than pins or the Velcro rollers, which are terrible for your hair. The set came quick and the price was quite low compared to other stores, like a beauty supply. The only thing I really need to mention is, the instructions say to keep the pink clips on while the set is heating. I thought that odd, but I did so. The first time, everything went smooth. The second time, I smelled burning plastic and found two of the pink clips were melting against the rollers. Make sure to keep every clip precisely aligned on each side of the roller, they will melt if too close to the metal heating bars . If that makes absolutely no sense, I apologize, as I couldn&#x27;t think of a better way to explain it. Other than not being an idiot, I love this set, and find no issues. Heats quick, but the rollers do get quite hot to touch, creates lovely waves.</li>
    <li> I have used hot rollers every day of my life since about age 16......and I am in my 50&#x27;s.  I have long hair and it is part of my daily routine.  Needless to say, I have tried many brands and have to say this one is by far the best.  I had a special open drawer built into my bathroom vanity dressing counter so it is plugged in all the time and all I have to do is pull out the drawer (no sides) and flip the on switch each morning.  This is the first time I have reordered the same set.  It has been right on 5 years and they stopped heating.  I don&#x27;t want any other brand, size or design.  The rollers heat up fast; the clips are great; and the soft rollers make  the curls last.  the slanted design is easy to use and get the rollers out without burning fingers, like so many others. Hope they never stop making these.</li>
    <li> wonderful set of rollers, my hair comes out bouncy and shiny and looks fabulous, I get many complements on my hair after using these rollers, highly recommend them, a bit of a challenge rolling back as clips will have the hair fall forward but with some patience I always manage to get the roller to stay where I want it,,,,,,,, it&#x27;s worth the extra work..........</li>
    <li> These work very good.  I have very dry hair, especially after one year of chemo.  It grew back in but it&#x27;s so fine and dry.  When I used the Remington Ceramic Heated Rollers, my hair came to life again.  Does not damage your hair and as a matter of fact it put a lot of shine to it.  The whole thing  takes up space but if you have unruly hair or damaged looking and dry hair, get this and see what a difference it does.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it.  The curls last too.</li>
    <li> The problem I have with these rollers is no matter what I do the top rollers don&#x27;t stay put...they fall back and end up on my forehead.  The clips don&#x27;t work for the top curlers and the side ones that are near my scalp burn since they don&#x27;t hold still either.  The curl is lasting and other than the size of the set (takes up too much space) the set is okay.</li>
    <li> The curlers are bulky so they would be hard to travel with, but they warm up quickly and do make a nice curl and the pink cover on the curlers does provide heat to the top layer of hair which helps control the frizzies.  I saw an add of TV for curlers that were somewhat like this but a lot more expensive.  These curlers were a great alternative at a much more reasonable price.  I wish they made a travel size set.</li>
    <li> I bought these from walmart and only when I got home looked at the reviews. Crap, I thought, these are not going to work. Well, to my surprise....they worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: long, normal/fine and naturally straight with a very slight wave. I let these heat for 10 minutes and left them on for about 30 and now I have loose, sexy curls, which is what I wanted. More of a subtle Victoria&#x27;s secret moldel-looking loose wave/curl than a tight ringlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: There are very slight creases in some areas but it&#x27;s not noticeable. My hair did get caught a couple times in the slit when unwinding but it was not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: The process is much easier for me then my normal routine (dry, curl with curling iron, pin each section, wait, release) so this wins!</li>
    <li> I got this product thinking it would be a cheaper sub for the expensive topstyler system. It does the job if you&#x27;re wanting great curls, but the crease it leaves is very annoying! Once its there, its there...I usually end up having to put my hair in a ponytail if the crease can&#x27;t be hidden....</li>
    <li> Heats fast, but doesn&#x27;t curl well &amp; curls don&#x27;t last.  It also takes longer to use rollers than regular flat iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these rollers a few times now. They aren&#x27;t great. The rollers say they heat up in about 1 1/2 minutes and set your hair as soon as 5. I don&#x27;t really agree with that.   I have managed to melt a few of the rollers together on accident. The metal trof they sit on has to be right in the middle of the rollers without the plastic clips touching it and the rollers cannot touch each other or oopsy you will melt them together. They still work as well as they did before.   I like the plastic clips to secure the rollers in your hair. Unfortunatly they are quite hot when you first take them out, but they do cool quickly. It is also nice that there are enough rollers to cover all of my below the shoulder hair. These rollers just don&#x27;t put a good curl in my hair.   I&#x27;m keeping them because it just isn&#x27;t worth returning them. I&#x27;m going to continue to try and work with them to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> the curls thing or what ever go too got and I couldn&#x27;t hold them had to turn it off but other then that it was awsome my hair was pretty and curly</li>
    <li> I got these as a christmas gift and i love them. They are easy to use and they are the only thing i have ever used that gives me curls that last. Totally recommend them.</li>
    <li> I am a die-hard hot roller user. I was a little bummed out when I realized that the Remington Ceramic Pearl rollers were a velvet texture, as I am also a great investor in thermal-set. I knew there was no using thermal set with these rollers, because it would ruin the velvet shell of the roller.  I have very thick, moderately long, naturally wavy hair. *PAIN IN THE BUTT* The rollers initial heat time is around 90 seconds, and there is a curl-set time of 5 minutes. I got my entire head to look like shirley temple in less than 30 minutes, with no need to retouch. The curls lasted in both bounce and shape all day and... even after waking up in the morning!  These rollers are great! I will never go back to the standard plastic-and-pin models. Also, you&#x27;ll never see me buy thermal set ever again!    Literally the only downside is that the curlers sit on a heat bar, so there is a slit in every roller. My hair tends to get caught in it. Yeah. It sucks. But it takes half a second to get it uncaught, and I&#x27;m back to business!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t curl your hair if the curlers don&#x27;t stay in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my old set was worn out, I received these as a Christmas gift.  I am kicking myself for throwing out my old ones.  No matter how carefully I roll and clip - no matter how little hair I use, the rollers fall out.  I stand perfectly still; they fall out.  Imagine that as you&#x27;re trying to get ready for work, or a wedding, or some other event.  MADDENING!  I&#x27;ll concede that they heat up &amp; curl my hair quickly, but they&#x27;re not worth it AT ALL.  I&#x27;ll go back to using a curling iron or buy another set.  These suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whomever thought the plastic clips were an improvement over the giant bobby-pin-type metal clips....you were wrong.  Please start manufacturing the old style again!</li>
    <li> I bought this curler set from a local store.  I used it one time and that was it.... took it right back to the store!  The rollers did a fine job of curling my hair, even though they seemed way smaller than they should be... but the clips melted together!!!!  The first one puzzled me... figured it was just defective and made wrong... no biggie... but then the second.. and so on.  I made sure they were not touching any metal or the outside of the unit and still, they melted.  I had somewhere to be so made the best of it, didn&#x27;t use the ones I had noticed had melted... but ended up with melted plastic in my hair anyways!  No thanks... for the price... go to Sally&#x27;s and get a professional quality one for a buck more!</li>
    <li> Great styling tool! Easy to maneuver, even for the typically beauty/hair-tool challenged like myself and my curls last all day! :)</li>
    <li> These were for my neighbor.  While I have not used them myself, she tells me that they are awkward to use, difficult to put on, and not nearly as good as the product she used previously, which has been discontinued.  But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything else at a reasonable price, so she is stuck with them.</li>
    <li> Bought this set from Walmart thinking it would work better with my hair with the clips, as opposed to the giant wire bobby pin clips used with my other set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do heat up fast which was nice.  But, they are VERY hot to the touch, even on the very outside rim of the curler, so actually handling them while rolling your hair around them will give you burns. I did a test last night with them and was only able to manage doing about 8 rollers before my fingers just couldn&#x27;t handle it any more. I can still feel the burn in my fingers today.  If I were to keep these, I&#x27;d have to find some gloves to wear while using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other con to these is the clips - I thought from the design and the marketing for these clips, they were a great idea. However in reality, not so much. Every single curl had a very noticeable crease at the base from the clip after I took the roller out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the burnt fingers and the clip creases, I&#x27;m returning asap.</li>
    <li> Perfectly packaged when shipped, that&#x27;s the good news.  However the rollers are too heavy and get too hot to handle- even the edges.  The Clips will leave a line across your hair unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Sister loved it and has not complained yet.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my hair rollers today, but I quickly became a bit apprehensive when I noticed the product box looked as if it had been previously opened. The plastic box that the rollers came in was also tapped shut in the front with masking tape which left a sticky residue when removed. Upon opening the package, the rollers themselves were disheveled. However, I thought it was because they popped out of place due to the shipping process. Unfortunately, I checked through the rollers and was very disappointed to find some stray hairs still attached to one of the rollers. So much for this item being labeled as \\&quot;NEW\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love this Flipping thing. in the morning when i wake up i plug it in . go shower n brush my teeth. then pop them in before i start my makeup. before i leave the house i take them out , volumized curls are the result</li>
    <li> I love these curlers. They heat fast and are simple to use. They are very comfortable and they stay put.</li>
    <li> Hot rollers have made huge advances in the last 15 - 20 years.  I am so impressed by how quickly they heat up, how easy they are to handle when they are hot and how soft my hair is all day.  I&#x27;d definitely buy these as a gift for someone who likes to curl their hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These get too hot and I have had the plastic pieces melt while warming. It should have a temperature control and timer that turns off once the product has reached that amount. I have burned my scalp while using them. I do not recommend buying them until they make adjustments to the product. As someone that has curled my hair with rollers for over 20 years now, I can say that these are the worst ones I have ever used. They should be recalled.</li>
    <li> This is the first set of hot rollers I have ever used, and I thought they worked great! They did heat up fast, although they werent SUPER hot or anything, but it being my first set I dont have a comparison. I didn&#x27;t time myself on how long they took to set, I just left them in until they felt cool, but it wasnt long at all. I think it took about 30 minutes to do my entire head, and I&#x27;m sure I will get faster with practice. My hair type may be why I had better success than the other reviewer... mine is thick and has a natural curl, so it will usually hold a style even without product. These rollers took my dry frizzed out hair to smooth and wavy. My husband says I look amazing. :)</li>
    <li> This set does not work on my hair, which is thick and shoulder length.  The curlers do not hold heat long enough to get a curl.  The clips do not hold my hair to the curler and by the time I&#x27;m done setting my hair the first curlers I have put in are already falling out.  The grip from the clips is not strong enough, even when I put very little hair in the curlers.  Also, the clips leave a line in my hair which doesn&#x27;t happen when curlers have the standard wire clip.  I can understand where this might work if you have very fine hair, but if your hair is longer and thick avoide this product.  I&#x27;m going back to the &#x27;standard&#x27;  ones.</li>
    <li> It took some getting use to that its not like other hot curling sets I have owned in the past. So use to the iron clips. This is much easier on the hair, just one thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is the way it sits in the unit. So easy to burn the plastic clips. Hope they are replaceable. But so far, it not a bad product.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what all the complaints are about. I have SUPER long, thick, layered hair - to the middle of my back. I have a hard time with it just holding a curl with a curling iron.  I let these heat up for at least 10 minute. Takes me about 15 minutes to get them all in. Let them set another 10-15 mins. And then I have amazing curls and body. I get nothing but compliments!! Very satisfied with the curls and the look it gives my hair. The curls don&#x27;t last all day. But that is not the fault of the rollers - I don&#x27;t expect miracles, bc like I said, my hair is very long and thick. But for the challege I have given these rollers - they do a FABULOUS JOB! I know with the right hair product and pre-treatment, my curls could last all day. I took away a star bc with my hair length, I do wish they were all large rollers, but this is as close as it gets.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy these.  They are dangerous.  I just used mine the other day for the first time and they blew out the GFI outlet in the bathroom.  That means I now need to have an electrician come and replace the outlet to restore electricity in the bathroom, which is an expensive proposition.  They definitely heated right up and I used them immediately, but I guess they got soooo hot that they blew the outlet.  It&#x27;s so bad that the buttons on the GFI outlet don&#x27;t even function at all.  Completely disabled.  Not good.    I called Remington to report the problem, but after waiting on hold for 10 mins. I continued to get passed around from dept. to dept.  Seems they wanted to ignore the problem and frustrate me.  It worked.  I hung up.    Anyhow, based upon the extremely poor customer service and complete lack of concern over their Fire Hazard set of rollers, it&#x27;s apparent that this is not a company you want to buy from.  In the product description, the rollers sounded great.  In actuality, they&#x27;re dangerous and horrible!</li>
    <li> I hesitated to purchase these because of the very mixed reviews. I got them today, and I LOVE them. The set itself is larger than I expected, certainly larger than any heated rollers I have used before. The rollers are lightweight, but that means they don&#x27;t fall out of my hair. The surface grips the hair very nicely, and the clips hold securely. I love that the clips are heated along with the rollers. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking for heated rollers.</li>
    <li> Gua i like this product is easy used is very good thanks.</li>
    <li> I had the older model and it worked amazing! This one the new clips don&#x27;t stay on. They pop right off. Super annoying.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about these....I was a bit worried about the clips but I am really happy with my purchase.  The unit heats up really well which is nice.  The curlers come in a medium size and a smaller size.  At first I did not think I would use the smaller size but the curl is actually quite nice.  The clips are neat as well as they really hold in the head of the curler.  I do have one compliant...as others have mentioned....and that is the clips do leave a little line or mark in the hair.  For me this is not such an issue except for the front sections right around my face...there I do not want to have any clip marks so maybe I will get some traditional U-shaped clips for the curlers placed around my face.  The shipping was really fast.  Overall I am happy with the unit...I wish I did not get the marks in my hair from the clips but I think I can make it work.</li>
    <li> These rollers get very hot which is a plus for long holding curl--which they certainly do hold a curl. However, they get so hot i have burned my neck twice now. Regular rollers that get this hot can be secured tightly, not these! I want to return these for numerous reasons, they don&#x27;t hold tight with the clamp system falling out of hair or \\&quot;dropping\\&quot; pieces of your hair. Also, the clamp must be placed just so (usually from the underside) or you will have a visible kink curled into that section from the clamp. Problem is to get them to stay at all you need to ream them tight to your head and place clamp directly on top. Without a tight roll, you don&#x27;t get the curl at the root to provide volume. My hair got tangled and it was just a mess. I have had many curler sets and I a seasoned roller. Really disappointed with these. Plus, the unit they come in is so large and awkward you can&#x27;t even think about traveling with it and where in the world do I store these?</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work very well , sent them back.</li>
    <li> Met expectations,  Is not as compact as I would like, but it is well designed&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly.  The rollers sometimes too hot to handle with comfort</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Target and was impressed initially, it heated up VERY fast and set very quickly. However, the curls didn&#x27;t stay at all. The next time I used it, the curlers didn&#x27;t heat up at all. The product is too bulky and big for a regular sized bathroom, and the product doesn&#x27;t perform. too bad, it was such a great concept.</li>
    <li> I wasted my money on these &amp; regret purchasing them.  The only good quality I can think of is that they get very hot, very quickly.  However, if not placed in your hair in the most perfect way, they POP out of your hair!  Grrr!!! Very inconvenient! And often they get \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; in my hair when I am removing them &amp; my wavy hair ends up frizzy.  If you travel with these, you must check every one of them to make sure they haven&#x27;t shifted (and they will!) because when you plug them in to use them again, the clips will have melted on the base.  VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!  There is NO EASE OF USE with these!</li>
    <li> I really like these heated rollers.  After reading that the clips had melted for some people, I paid particular attention to how long I plugged them in for.  Also, I removed the clips after plugging them in.  These rollers do heat up very fast and do a great job.  If the risk of the clips melting were not an issue, I would rate these rollers 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have never used the rollers. I saw this at the gym and used the Remington hair rollers. That was amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I have thin to moderate hair that is shoulder length. I had looked forward to buying a set of rollers with the clip, because I had heard it would create a better lasting curl, however I can barely get the curl to set to begin with using these clips. The pink claw doesn&#x27;t provide NEARLY enough grip to hold the curl. Before I am finished half the rollers are sliding down my head. I never had this problem using pins and I deeply regret purchasing this set instead of one with pins. They also leave a crease, since you can&#x27;t get the roller and clip to stay near the top of your head. Waste of money, two stars only because the heat is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody know where I can buy pins that might fit these?</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My old heated curlers had to be kept on by a metal piece that kept slipping off.  I love the clips that go right over the curlers.  So quick and easy to use. Creates beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> Love them just that one of the clips on small roller was broken when I got shipment. Love the fact they heat up so quick and make life easier.</li>
    <li> This would be a great hot-roller set if the clips were not so flawed.  The rollers are a spongy material that is gentle on the hair.  The set is designed so the ceramic clips heat up and the curl is warmed from both the roller and the clip.  The case is nice with a lid that keeps the rollers clean and helps it heats very quickly.  The set does not have an on-off switch so you must unplug them to turn it off. The number of rollers is just right to do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the reason why you should NOT buy this set:  the clips have a small lip on the edges and when they are placed on the roller they leave a flat place on every curl.  When the roller is removed there is a flat spot right at the scalp that skews the curl in the opposite direction.  Incredulously, it appears this product was designed and marketed without ever testing it.  I like the rollers so much that I contacted the company to see if they had re-designed the clips. On the Remington site there is shown a replacement set of clips.  Their answer was that &#x27;sadly, the clips are the same ones that came with the original set.&#x27; I bought a different set of clips from a beauty supply store and I am using them.  It eliminates the flat spot but since the clips are not designed for the set, the lid won&#x27;t close with them attached the curlers.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast, works great and stores easily and gives me the desired look I wanted! Have recommended it to all my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> Pros: They heat up very quickly. Curl lasts a long time if you leave them in until they cool. They don&#x27;t burn your fingers. Flocking on the rollers to help keep your hair stuck to them.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The biggest is the crimping that occurs with the plastic clips. My hair looks terrible, especially up toward the hairline. And I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different ways to clip it but it always crimps my hair. Also, if the curlers shift and you don&#x27;t notice it and heat up the set, the plastic melts and then makes it difficult to get the roller back on the rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend these at all. Looking for a new set immediately!</li>
    <li> We are RV full timers and I simply did not have the storage room this product required.  Cannot speak to its functionality, but I will say I am desperate to find a hot/steam large roller sized unit that really works.  I have tried about 4 different brands now and they all fall out of my hair.</li>
    <li> These hot rollers are TERRIBLE. Besides being awkward to use, they don&#x27;t work well! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  However, returning them was a breeze with Amazon!</li>
    <li> I agree with many other reviewers on this product: These rollers create pretty curls, but they don&#x27;t get very hot so the curls don&#x27;t set well and don&#x27;t last. Also, they don&#x27;t heat up nearly as quickly as they say they do. When I only let them heat for five minutes, as advertised, I didn&#x27;t even get enough curl to last an hour. When I let them heat up for 20 minutes or so before using, the curls lasted 6 or 8 hours, though they were very loose curls--not quite what I expected or wanted. If these rollers got hotter and/or heated more quickly, I think the curls they create would last longer, and I&#x27;d be much happier with this product. As they are, I&#x27;m not very satisfied, as it takes about 45 minutes to allow for sufficient heat-up, rolling and styling--which is way too long, since I purchased these thinking that process would be much quicker. I&#x27;m hoping the manufacturer will find a way to make these get hotter faster, because I really like the style of the rollers/clips and the ease of rolling with these rollers.</li>
    <li> Heats up relatively quickly, and sets nicely in my hair. There isn&#x27;t a great place to grab the rollers, they are hot all over so it takes some quickness and finesse to get them in. Unfortunately the edge of the clips leaves a slight crease in my hair once I pull the rollers out. Overall they work pretty well though on days when I can just throw a little product in, and get the rollers in within a few minutes and leave them in while I finish getting ready. The days when I have time to use a curling iron I find I get a nicer look, but it certainly takes longer.</li>
    <li> I have straight, fine, thin blonde hair.  I roll my hair and it stays for five days if I can&#x27;t get to it earlier.  I have more body than the curling iron can give me.  They are so easy to use and much faster than the curling iron and my arms don&#x27;t hurt from holding the iron.  I love my rollers and am buying a set for my sisters birthday.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t do a lot of research when I selected this product.  After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical, but decided to give them a try and have been pleasantly surprised with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order came very quickly, so i was happy I didn&#x27;t bother paying for faster shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I find the curlers efficient and easy to use.  Yes, they do get hot, but that&#x27;s what they are supposed to do (not really sure why others have complained that they can&#x27;t hold them).  My unit heats up quickly, which is another plus (again, others have complained it takes forever to heat, but mine is ready in under two minutes).  I have fairly thick, wavy hair to begin with, but find that the Remington curlers work very fast (I put them in, then either brush my teeth or moisturize my face, then take them out and curls are bouncy and ready to go - also, curls last for several days or until I next wash my hair).  I&#x27;m sure it depends on what type of hair you have to start with - if you&#x27;ve got bone straight hair, you might need to leave them in longer, but my hair takes a curl fast, so only a few minutes are required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the velvet-like inner section of the curlers, rather than a comb like interior, so that my hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled up in the combs.  The clips work well enough - as I get to the longer sections of hair, they might slip just a little, but they never fall out.  I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t have any creasing issue that others have complained about - my curls look healthy and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this product a few times, so I&#x27;m sure I need more practice, but my only issue is that when the curlers are near my ears they are too hot and I can see how someone could hurt themselves if they are not careful - I&#x27;ve taken to putting a hairband around my ear for protection and problem is solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good product, I&#x27;m pleased and would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> These rollers are so easy to use. The unit heats up quickly....90 seconds, and I literally only left them in my hair for 5 minutes. My hair length is between my ear and shoulder and I had so much fullness in the hairstyle...just what I was looking for.  The first time I used it, I let it heat up too long and the rollers were WAY too hot to handle...told hubby I needed asbestos gloves to put the rollers in my hair but the second time I didn&#x27;t let it heat up so long and it was much better. The lid was closed when I heated it so maybe I should leave it open...not sure because the instructions are vague on that. Overall, for the price, this is a good unit.  It will be awkward to take along on trips, but i&#x27;ll figure something out.</li>
    <li> Please note I purchased these hot rollers from another brick-n-mortar store.  I think they work fine.  They heat up exceptionally fast.  I did learn recently that if I plugged them in too soon and left them sit, they get really hot.  So hot, in fact, that two of the rollers melted then fused together when they cooled down.  I was able to pull them apart and still use them.  I do wish the unit had a heat control function; unfortunately, it&#x27;s either on or off, that&#x27;s it.  Luckily, even though they go get quite hot, you can still handle them if you do so fairly quickly.  I have shoulder length hair, which is pin straight and very baby fine, and I can roll &amp; unroll my hair in &amp;lt;10 minutes.  As soon as I&#x27;m done rolling my hair, I start removing the rollers starting with the first one.  I get a nice loose curl, something similar to what a body-wave perm would produce.  All-in-all, I&#x27;d recommend these.</li>
    <li> The hot roller set I had been using for the past few years finally stopped working, so I bought this set to replace them.  What junk.  The rollers are very lightweight, which means they don&#x27;t hold the heat very well,  which means they don&#x27;t produce much of a curl.  The clips are so slippery that they don&#x27;t hold on for even a second without popping right off. I actually had to salvage the clips from my old set in order to hold the rollers in place for use.  The box that warms them up is bulky, it takes up alot of space on the counter. Some things are just so cheaply made they shouldn&#x27;t make it to the consumer...and this would be an example of that.</li>
    <li> Great curlers. Easy to use, and they heat up quickly. They don&#x27;t hurt my fine hair!</li>
    <li> Once I rolled my hair onto the roller it would fall backwards in the opposite direction. There was NO WAY to correct this so I returned them. I highly recommend you move onto something else that is actually better designed to curl hair.</li>
    <li> The wife Now Trying To Use It ,It Does Not Even Heat up,No Good Product, Piece Of Garbage !</li>
    <li> The description sounds really great---but don&#x27;t be fooled! I have fine hair and curls normally don&#x27;t hold up well, so given this fact, I was not expecting too much. Well was I let down big time! At least it should have held up for 3 hours (normal curling iron hold time for me) but instead, just after 2 hours, it was flat and lost all its bounce! If you have hard to curl hair, this does absolutely nothing.  It did heat up fast and I was pleased with the actual felt rollers itself, but will say the black little felt pieces falls off here and there (when new) and I would imagine it would be hard for ppl with light colored hair as you&#x27;ll end up seeing little black felt furry pieces in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have had these rollers for a few months.  And absolutely adore them.  They make getting ready in the morning so easy.  My hair stopped holding a curl after the first week, however I talked to my stylist and she said I didn&#x27;t let my hair set long enough after I took the curlers out. Ta-Da problem solved! :-) And the longer you leave the curlers in the tighter your curl.  I think this is a great product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the product.  Sometimes the clips get too hot to touch but it&#x27;s because they were left plugged in too long.  Shipping time was excellent.</li>
    <li> I purchased the rollers because of the slim design - easier to pack.  The case was quite a bit larger than shown and much higher than indicated by the picture.  I will return them.</li>
    <li> I tried out and returned several different brands of hot rollers before keeping these! They are great! Yes- they are lightweight, so they don&#x27;t fall right out of your hair. The velvet really does help the end of your hair to cling to the roller without pulling out, and to give the end result a nice, uniform curl... no kinky ends! I have not had any problems with the clips sliding off, they stay in place and really do cut down on the time it takes to set. They heat up fast, they cool down quickly, but not so quickly that they don&#x27;t do their job. There are more than enough to do your whole head of hair at once, and the two sizes of curler compliment each other. My only complaint is how big the unit is... It takes up a lot of space on the counter, but I can live with that.</li>
    <li> I am definitely new to the world of styling hair. And I have been super satisfied with these rollers. I have no rhyme or reason to my rolling: I just roll my hair up in the rollers haphazardly, and it still looks fabulous. I am in the process of learning how to roll my hair better, but even for a newbe like me, these rollers are easy to use and have a nice learning curve: you can be a beginner and still look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got a keratin treatment to straighten my naturally curly, thick, long hair. I will update my review once I try the rollers with my newly treated hair.</li>
    <li> These rollers get hot QUICK!!! The best I have used.  Definitely a must have. I have no regrets buying them.</li>
    <li> I had read all the reviews on these and other rollers on Amazon because I was looking for a new set of rollers. I have been around long enough to have used ALL the different kinds over the years, the origianl clairol hot rollers, rollers with steam, caruso rollers, travel sets, including conair flocked large (my favorites)I needed a new set with enough rollers to do my entire head. When I saw these rollers at Walmart, marked down below $30.oo I bought them, knowing they were a good deal. But I went into it knowing some of the drawbacks ahead of time...  PROS: Heats fast, flocked covering, enough for the whole head, soft waves,very shiny hair(due to rollers?) heated clips  CONS: Horrible clips,(won&#x27;t keep rollers in tightly), weird side slit on roller, but so far haven&#x27;t experienced tangles, I face the slit to the mirror when I roll and that keeps the hair end around the other side,huge case that doesn&#x27;t fit on counter and forget about traveling with them, would take half the suitcase, small rollers too small for my needs, but that&#x27;s me,clips DO leave a line on your hair but it comes out.  I don&#x27;t hate them, and I watch very carefully that I don&#x27;t let them get too hot. All electric rollers can burn your neck, your ear or cheek, stuff kleenex between you and your skin!  If your hair is full of static in the winter, spray your brush with static guard and it won&#x27;t be anymore.  I think these rollers do the job for me. I have shoulder length hair,and it&#x27;s fine, one length, tapered front to back. I use the rollers so my hair curls under a little and I hate the pulling and tugging of styling with a dryer and brush because my hair gets frizzy. My hair is smooth and shiny after using these rollers but I also find they don&#x27;t produce a tight curl. I am going to buy different clips to see if they stay in better.If I were to choose another set to buy, it would be the conair set with the large rollers and the jumbos but I was afraid the jumbos were not going to be tight enough.They do come in a smaller case, but there are fewer rollers.  Hope this helps. I think this is a roller set that some people will like and some will not like at all.    UPDATE 2/19/12 I had my first \\&quot;melting\\&quot; incident, two of the clips somehow melted against the heating bar inside. One of the clips then cooled and fused togehter and I had to remove the spring, cut it apart with scissors, then put it back together. I did buy the other clips from Conair, and frankly I think they are only marginally better. Next time I use the curlers I am going to try the old metal clips saved from my older hot curler models. As for the curlers, I hope it&#x27;s my imagination, but they don&#x27;t seem to be getting as hot and I&#x27;ve used them under 10 times. I&#x27;m starting to feel disappointed in this purchase...    UPDATE 3/24/12 Don&#x27;t buy these rollers. I am going to be either donating them or giving them away. They don&#x27;t get hot enough, they leave ridges on your hair, the large rollers aren&#x27;t really large enough and the overall size of the unit is hard to manage on a small bathroom vanity. The rollers don&#x27;t seem to have any heat retaining core, the clips do deliver heat to the hair, but as mentioned, leave ridges. I did buy the spider claw like clips to substitute, those leave ridges as well and don&#x27;t deliver any additional heat to the curl. Will have to buy yet another set of hot rollers. Frustrated that I can&#x27;t return them (purchased in walmart)    UPDATE 7/15/12  Donated them to goodwill and purchased a Conair set with 4 jumbo and 8 extra large, same size as the Conair travel set that I also have. They have a flocked covering, and the slit opening. If you remember to face the slit to the mirror when rolling, you will not tangle the hair in the slit. Do not love the plastic clips, leave ridges (that come out, btw) so I use an old set of metal ones that do fine on all but the 4 jumbo rollers. This is a great set of rollers! They heat quickly as promised and create soft curls. I use them practically every day and hope they last a long time so I don&#x27;t have to go thru this again!</li>
    <li> Left a weird kink line in my hair from where there is a space in the roller portion for heating part. WASTE of money!</li>
    <li> These are the best curlers!! I ordered these exact same curlers about 2/12 years ago. When mine wore out, I was so happy to find the exact same ones here again. I love that the clips stay with the curlers. I hate the ones that you have to have a seperate bag or bowl just folr clips. This is so easy and they make my hair look faboulous!!! :)</li>
    <li> Not bad, but it does get very hot and hard to handle without getting your fingers burned as you curl your hair.  I also find the clips flimpsy.  Looks like the clips can break easily and they do not hold the roller in place as good as the wire pins.</li>
    <li> Was not brand new found hair inside it, and when switched on they all melted and fell apart. Will cost me MORE money now to send the piece of crap back.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers at a local Wal Mart.  The pink clips don&#x27;t have claws on them, therefore, they have nothing to grip with and will not stay in the hair.  The rollers get hot, but do not stay hot long enough.  I went to a Sally&#x27;s hair store and bought two packs of clips to use with it that had little teeth that I thought would maybe grip the hair.  they are just barely large &amp; long enough to grip my hair, and I have to be careful while rolling other parts not to bump into the tops of the claws on the already rolled hair or they will come loose and fall out.  And when I unroll my hair there is very little curl in the back.  Really I just don&#x27;t like them, I have had them for about 3 weeks I guess.  I will have to keep them,  But I guess I will luse them sometime.  And also the clips I had to buy make little grooves in my hair.  In a word it is a \\&quot;mess\\&quot;.  I hope you can take what I have told you and improve the clips and make the rollers stay hot longer.  That would be a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesa Stem</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;m a very visual individual, so I really love the display case.&lt;br /&gt;2. The rollers heat up very quickly and get quite hot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a three star rating for 2 reasons.  Here is are the drawbacks for me:&lt;br /&gt;1. I would have liked more variety in roller size as the kit seems to have only medium and large rollers.  I like to use the small ones around the frame of my face.&lt;br /&gt;2. My hair is a medium thickness so sometimes I have to re-roll a couple of times to get the clip to stay in correctly, as I like my rollers to sit on my head as snug as possible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope these comments are helpful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my daughters&#x27; because I accidently burnt the plastic portion of the rollers .. which is why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star .. if you are not careful with checking before plugging in you will start to melt the clips if they are not centered on bars just right.</li>
    <li> These curlers are fabulous !! They heat quickly and curl  your hair , no fuss no muss!  The longer you leave them in the stronger the curl.  They came in the mail within 2 weeks  and were ready to go. Definitly would recommend.</li>
    <li> Completely crap...plastic on rollers melted with the heat n they stuck to mettle rod..n now they r damaged...do nt recomend it...wastage of money...:((</li>
    <li> The clips on these curlers leave an ugly line across the hair.  I tried different ways of using them with the same effect.  I will be taking them back to the retail store I purchased them from.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my friend in Indonesia, but unfortunately she couldn&#x27;t use it yet, cause there&#x27;s a different voltage level. The voltage in Indonesia is 240 Volt. Thank you.</li>
    <li> A curling iron does not adequately curl my hair.  So I bought this hairsetter.  It is awesome!  Hair doesn&#x27;t tangle--and mine is very tangle-prone.  The curls are just beautiful.  I don&#x27;t like the clips as some other people did not.  I bought Conair clips and they work much better.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> is perfect product to get curly hair look.&lt;br /&gt;helps to save time...&lt;br /&gt;effect like after hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;i am satisfy with it a 100%.</li>
    <li> These curlers heat up fast and make my hair curl beautifully. Unlike other curlers I&#x27;ve tried in the past, they rarely get tangled.  Amazing buy.</li>
    <li> These rollers are awesome!!! I would say I am fairly hair style challenged. I can straighten my hair just fine but when it comes to anything more involved I struggle and don&#x27;t get good results. My hair needs high heat to hold a decent curl. These rollers are the ticket! The first time I went to use them and every other time I have had amazing results. I start at the bottom and work my way to the top. By the time I get to the top I can already start removing the bottom ones! My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out of the clip until I take it out. It curls so well I usually have to put it in a clip for 10 minutes to relax the curl just a little. Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! Where were these 10 years ago! :) :) Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and these are the worst curlers ever.  They do not stay in my hair for anything and the clips are the absolute worst things.  There are no teeth to grip the hair, so they end up just hanging and then burn my face when I can&#x27;t clip them back up.  The case is so big and bulky and this definitely was not a good purchase.  Hence the reason I&#x27;m on Amazon looking for new curlers.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair that doesnt want to take a curl. these do the trick and they last all day!</li>
    <li> I love this set! I am all thumbs when it comes to styling my hair but I can make it look great with this product.  Easy to use.  Wish it had an on off switch but that is ok safer to unplug it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> my hair is about 24 inches long and rollers don&#x27;t stay on very well.  clips fall off even if i just get a small amount of hair</li>
    <li> The curlers themselves are all right.  They lose heat fast, but can produce a decent curl about 80% of the time.  This would give the product 3 stars.  I&#x27;m docking it a star, however, because my item was very much used.  Everything had that layer of film on it (including the box) that you usually see at yard sales.  Had to wash and scrub everything just to use it.  Should&#x27;ve returned it on that alone, but I didn&#x27;t.  But I don&#x27;t see myself buying anything from Remington anytime soon.  Reselling something that was obviously in someone else&#x27;s care for quite a while (and under the guise of a new product) is unprofessional.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used heated rollers. This set is really nice and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These were the worst curlers I have ever used.  I was looking forward to all of the wonderful things that these were supposed to do and they did nothing. The rollers were warm at best and they did not stay in my hair at all.  They clips did burn my neck as they slipped out of my hair.  Nothing I could do would make them stay in my hair.  I returned them immediately.  Apparently you have to give at least one star.</li>
    <li> Best how rollers I have ever used.  They do better than any curling iron I have ever owned.  I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I bought the rollers to speed up the curling process for myself in the mornings and it ended up taking just as long with worse results. Might just take me some time to practice but super straight hair is hard to wrap perfectly around these.</li>
    <li> I read and purchased these rollers based on previous reviews.  They were right on. These came and I used them in my relaxed fine shoulder length hair and had great curls and body.  I&#x27;m especially pleased with the rollers and clamps not being hot when using then.  The clips are much better than the pins I&#x27;ve used in other sets. These don&#x27;t get hot. Ready now.  No more curlers worn at night. I just wrap my hair pull it down and roller set it with these rollers. Perfect. Oh yeah. The container is big. But when I travel I&#x27;ll get a carryon for these.  Hair is important.  So these go with me on the plane!</li>
    <li> They work very well, heat fast, and VERY hot.  My biggest fault with these are the size of the machine itself. You don&#x27;t get any more curlers than in the other type, but this is very large. It takes up a big amount of space on the counter. It would equal approximately two of the traditional type hot curler machines.  I had seen something before I bought that said, &amp;#34;to large to travel with&amp;#34;, I thought, how big could it be...??? But they weren&#x27;t kidding. This is uncomfortably big on the counter and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t contemplate trying to pack this into an over night bag, or a suit case.  Although they work VERY well, and really put a wonderful strong curl in my hair. (the curl gets stronger the longer you leave the curlers in) I probably would NOT buy this product again, if I knew what I know now. Just because of the overall size of the machine... The curlers are not in the machine vertically, but horizontally.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for fairly low priced curlers, look no further!!!! I have VERY thick, long (almost to my butt but I have a lot of layers), naturally wavy hair and it usually takes me 2 hours to curl my hair. However, I bought this product and that all changed. It its me maybe 10-15 minutes to complete my look. It would obviously be a lot faster for women with thinner hair but for those of us with thick hair, 10-15 minutes is NOTHING compared to how long we know it can take. I&#x27;m serious, if you buy this product you will NOT be sorry!</li>
    <li> This item is WAY large and took up most of the one half of my vanity.  It is high and wide and deep.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine hair and no body what so ever!!! This set is perfect for my hair type as I have struggled for years, trying every product available without results. I mostly get body and no curls which is what I was looking for. I do use L&#x27;Oreal Paris Everystyle Volume Boosting Mousse before blow drying. I have oily hair and wash everyday, so far I see no damage from the rollers after using for a week. Great product for my hair type. will absolutely purchase again when these wear out.</li>
    <li> Really like these Curlers. I&#x27;m not one of those ppl who is great with styling hair. I am terrible but can still get a good curl from these rollers. I put them in before doing makeup and when I take them out I have a nice curl that lasts longer if I leave heating up a little longer.  Quicker than the irons for me.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Rollers would not stay in. Clips are not tight enough.I would not recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing is too big It takes up too much room.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they are the same ones Jenna Jameson recommended on her site and I love her hair, they are good curlers not to hot to the touch. I&#x27;m not sure if its the curlers or the more likely my lack of experience in getting the curls to not have a stiff kink at the end, but with a little practice I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll smooth out</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I did purchase different clips as these can leave dents as another reviewer recommended. My hair doesn&#x27;t curl well but the first time I used these I kept them in for a while and I ended up with a LOT of curls and they lasted! I don&#x27;t keep them in as long now and get great body. The clips are Conair Champion salon pro roller clips. Recommend them too!</li>
    <li> I returned these right away. I&#x27;d like to thank Amazon for such an easy return process. The rollers were way too small and the clips look like they will make an indent in my hair but that&#x27;s just an observation as I never even plugged it in. Would work fine for shorter hair. I have med. length hair and these would have made my hair super curly and I would prefer bigger curls.</li>
    <li> I really like this rollers they heat up fast and leave beautiful curls. The only bad thing is they dont last all day unless you apply a ton of  product.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers.  I put my hair up in the morning, put on my makeup, take my hair down, quick comb through and am ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the clips that come with the rollers leave creases - especially on the hairline.  I have swapped out the clips that came with the rollers with comb clips and that fixed the problem.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this- love having lots of large rollers</li>
    <li> Ok. Does not work well on thin hair</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible!  Worse hot roller set I have ever purchased.  Rollers play slip and slide in hair especially if turned vertical.  Burn fingers with the clips, burn scalp when rollers are in.  Remington does respond to customer service request.</li>
    <li> The clips don&#x27;t stay on and the curlers fall out of my hair.  The rollers are wicked hot too and burn your fingers as you try to put them in your hair.</li>
    <li> great for curling hair...gets hot quickly....but it looks a little cheaper from what I have purchased at target....but honestly, it heats up better and has a better curl than the ones from target. Only concern is that I have dropped two of the jumbo rollers on the floor....or rather they fell down as I was taking the curlers out,..I have laminate in my bathroom but the the ends broke off  after they fell....they still work even without the end piece...but this happened on the first fall...I am now very careful and lean over the sink to take my curler out.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and was skeptical. They did not disappoint! Easy to use, stay hot in the tray, easy clips</li>
    <li> My wife has been growing her hair out for the past few years, now nearly mid-back she was looking for new ways to style it and have different &#x27;looks&#x27;. We did some reasearching before settling on this set of rollers, she has not been disappointed in the least, and having practiced and experiementing with these, she is able to get a completely different style in just a short amount of time. She certainly loves what they can do to add body and fullness that she otherwise lacks without them.</li>
    <li> I bought these in a beauty shop and thought with the way they clip on it was a great solution to the other tyle of clips which you sometimes have to use two to keep rollers in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG mistake.  These rollers got SO hot I burned my fingers and my scalp...this cannot be good for your hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN the way thesw clips work, they leave a crease in your hair...they would have done much better to make these clips in a comb like fashion, do you did not get those creases...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T buy these or any other maker that makes a similar type...not only are they expensive, you will not like them.  I used them once and then returned them to the store where I bought them....nice concept but they need better clips, that don&#x27;t leave creases in your hair and there needs to be a maximum temperature that is not flaming hot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice concept, bad design</li>
    <li> Having trouble with the clips holding the rollers in.  I love the rollers, but I&#x27;m going to try some smaller clips to see if I can get them to hold.</li>
    <li> There were plenty of good reviews on this item but mine won&#x27;t be one of them.  I have a lot of hair that is stick straight.  The rollers wouldn&#x27;t stay in and the curl, what there was of it, didn&#x27;t last more than ten minutes.</li>
    <li> I love this product to death it works well on hair and I was able to use it on my mothers hair which is sorta dry and grey.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing to say about this product is that if you don&#x27;t keep the rollers on the heating Rack&#x27;s and one of them falls next to another in front of it--&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ll start to melt together! Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the product is great just make sure all the Hot Rollers are correctly positioned on the Heating Rack.</li>
    <li> These make beach waves in minutes. Plug them in while take your shower. Put curlers in after your hair is dry. While you put on your makeup-beach waves are forming. So easy! Really  nice product that saves time in the morning for looking your best.</li>
    <li> Curlers hang not completely rolled up to roots and they&#x27;re super hot.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers - quick and easy</li>
    <li> the rollers are not large enough for my long hair. it makes it difficult to curl it all. outside of that, the product is okay.</li>
    <li> The clipped rollers did not stay in your hair.  The unit took up too much space on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Great product, timely delivery.  This is my 2nd set of these rollers - first set I had about 6 years - still works but elements were getting worn.  This 2nd set works equally as well.</li>
    <li> Curls are not tight...it doesn&#x27;t last. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love them a little bulky but perfect variety of sizes and a great number I believe at least 24 couple of heads done at once! How cool is that!</li>
    <li> Rollers get hotter than any I&#x27;ve ever had. I wish there was an off switch. You have to unplug it.</li>
    <li> I bought these per request of my wife. The following is her assessment of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;- size of rollers were adequate&lt;br /&gt;- texture of the rollers were what expected and wanted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- took longer to heat than the manufacturer&#x27;s claim&lt;br /&gt;- the open design of the roller allowed for too much heat to escape, thereby not heating the hair sufficiently.&lt;br /&gt;- clips wouldn&#x27;t hold the rollers in place, U-clips would have been better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used hot rollers for years. My hair is straight and has the tendency to lose curl really quickly, unless I use hairspray on each individual strand as I am rolling it AND leave it in the rollers for 30 minutes. This allows my hair to have beautiful curls lasting even to the next day. Knowing this about my hair, I expected to leave the hot rollers in place at least 30min rather than the recommended time. Unfortunately, these hot rollers were completely cooled within 5min. I took a few out at the recommended time and removed some at the 30min mark as I normally do. Neither left me with any curl. These may work great for some, but for my long straight hair they did nothing.</li>
    <li> Nice set easy to use. Great as gift too.  It&#x27;s big though so make sure you have room for it</li>
    <li> These rollers are the second set we have purchased. Hard to find in the big box stores . Amazon is a great place to buy and Prime is a great program.</li>
    <li> Clips leave huge dents in my fine hair. I&#x27;ve tried changing how much hair I roll onto each clip, the curl pattern, etc and always seem to end up with some big dents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful with how you place the rollers onto the heating mechanism. If the clips are not properly aligned, the plastic will burn and stink up your bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because the unit heats up fast and resulting curls (other than dent) look good and last.</li>
    <li> Leaves marks in your hair from the clips. Not fun.</li>
    <li> Not a good hair rollers</li>
    <li> Works fine but big and bulky</li>
    <li> These make getting ready really fast, and don&#x27;t damage my hair. I am not looking for crazy curls, just tamed hair that looks like it has had something done with it, while getting to put in as little effort as possible, and these worked perfectly for that. They don&#x27;t hold a curl in my daughter&#x27;s waist length hair at all though (not even on the ends)</li>
    <li> I have not used heated rollers in years.  I bought these because they were inexpensive and I thought the ceramic rollers would be easy on my dry hair.  I try to take great care of my hair and had been using my chi curling iron but my hair has grown a lot and the curling iron was taking up too much of my life.  I just got these last night and used them this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First they heated up really fast, which was awesome.  Then when putting in my hair they were not too hot so I could handle them easily and not so hot as to damage my hair.  The curls I made turned out big and loose which is what I wanted to acheive and it held all day.  I admit I don&#x27;t have any problem keeping curls in my hair so I was glad that this product did what I expected.  I do not have any clamp marks as some others have mentioned, but I roll my hair from end to root like you are supposed to so I guess that&#x27;s why I did not have that issue.  Also I did not leave the rollers in more than 5 minutes.  I went and brushed my teeth and came back and took them out and then figure combed the curls out to relax them some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a damn good product for $30.  I have spent way more on my hair care and received much less in the past so this was a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the results and their is a 4 year manufactures warranty so I will keep the box and receipt and if it fails I will contact Remington&#x27;s customer service.</li>
    <li> What a waste. I have thick hair and it wouldn&#x27;t curl it at all- but it did actually melt the plastic of the curler, the holder and my fingers. This is a very dangerous design. I can&#x27;t believe they still sell this product. I actually sent it back.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste money. Even after 20 minutes the rollers were only \\&quot;warm\\&quot;. Left in for another 15-18 minutes, barely curled, got stuck to the rollers like velcro and my hair was frizzy with awful static all day no matter what I did. Worse ones I ever used, they are being returned tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I really love these rollers!  I have fine hair and I was worried that these rollers would not stay in my hair but they do!  The two sizes are perfect for me.</li>
    <li> guys heres a tip to keep the creases at the base of the head away! when curling, put a tissue in between the clip and the roller. this will help with the creasing!</li>
    <li> Love the hot rollers. I have long hair and the curls come out just right. Just the amount of rollers.</li>
    <li> I was excited after reading reviews for these curlers. I was disappointed these did not work very well at all. I let them heat up plenty long and tried different things but still couldn&#x27;t get a good curl- just a weird wave. My hair is medium length and thick but fine. It usually curls OK. I&#x27;ve used other hot rollers before that worked but were more moist. Regretting this purchase. Will probably try to return not sure if they&#x27;ll let me.</li>
    <li> I like how these rollers work, but they didn&#x27;t work that great on my hair. I need jumbo size rollers. The rollers are fuzzy-ish, but I couldn&#x27;t tell you what material that is. The clips DO hold well. It gets hot pretty quick. Overall, my disappointment is only with the roller size, and I kind of expected that to happen.</li>
    <li> Unless you literally want to wear oven gloves while doing your hair, don&#x27;t get these.  The reviewers saying these get too hot to handle are not kidding.  As in as hot as a casserole coming out of the oven around the rim of these things.  Unless you are used to this, can&#x27;t see how people use these.</li>
    <li> I bought these hot rollers a few months ago, after absolutely falling in love with the Remington Curling Wand (which I highly recommend to any and everyone who will listen). The first few times I used these rollers, I just put them in as normal, continued to get dressed, and then took them out. The curls I had were average, and they didn&#x27;t last longer than an hour. I even thought of just returning the roller set because it was nothing special at all. So what I thought to do after a while was to flat iron a section of my hair first to add a bit of extra heat (Nothing too serious. Just moved the hair through the flat iron), and then apply the hot roller to hold the curl from the flat iron a little longer. I got AMAZING results. The curls were gorgeous, tight, and lasted all day and even into the next day. This is the only method that I will use with this roller set. So if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of extra heat, I&#x27;d recommend this product. Plus I love the look of the pink rollers in my hair. Very glam!</li>
    <li> I originally bought these for my 14y old daughter, who&#x27;s always doing something to her hair. Because I usually get her to do my hair  as well (between my pro stylist appointments), the day she was rushing she used these curlers on my hair. In half the time it normally takes her and without the burning hair smell in the curlers, I had beautiful, romantic, bouncy curls! They were very sexy and lasted the entire day. I was even able to salvage them the next day by pin curling them at night with clips for the next day. I LOVE HOW EASY THESE CURLERS ARE!!!</li>
    <li> I returned it as it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was.</li>
    <li> This product did not suit to me.&lt;br /&gt;But I congratulate the commercial policy of Amazon which allowed me to send back(to dismiss) the package, free of charge, and which has just paid off to me my entire purchase.</li>
    <li> packaged was delivered exactly when they said it would be which was awesome because i needed to wrap it up for xmas. it was packaged neatly so it wouldnt move around in the box which is usually my concern when i purchase electronics. I cant say first hand how it works because i havent used it but my sister whom i gave it to loves it</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. This is my second set... the first set finally gave out after years of daily hard work. I do actually have a spare set at my mother&#x27;s house in addition to the set at my home. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have long hair (down to the small of my back) that&#x27;s straight. These rollers heat up within seconds and curl my hair within minutes- maybe 5. The curls are strong and hold all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> When I plugged them in, they proceeded to smoke. I thought it was normal burn off so I kept I eye on them and they still proceeded to smoke. I immediately unplugged them as they were about to burst into flames. Would definitely NOT buy this item again!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these curlers. I use them everyday. I rated them a 4 star because like the other reviewers say the curl those not last very long although on me it&#x27;s ok i put on gel or mousse and it works just fine for two days plus they are very gentle on the hair!</li>
    <li> First, I don&#x27;t know how these other women are keeping the clips from rolling down onto their faces, but I wish someone would tell me.  I thought the heated clips were genius, and they probably are, unless you can&#x27;t keep the curler up.  Then they fall down and burn the crap out of your face/ear/neck; well, skin in general.  I have used the plastic butterfly clips on the rollers that are in danger of burning my skin, and the heated clips on the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the clips do have to be placed carefully or you run the risk of melting them.  I have lost 4 clips this way in as many uses.  The thing is, that you have to take the clip off to use the roller, so either lay them aside [where they get cool quickly] or put them back on the bar [where they can melt].  I do realize that you must lay only one aside, as you can use the clip for the next roller on the roller in your hand, but that is not as feasible when you switch between the larger and smaller rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be more comfortable with a few more rollers to do my whole head [also not available] and would also like it if it were more portable.  Yes, I *did* have to have another suitcase to hold them comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do get hot and they do give great-looking curls!  Even if my perm is so crappy as not to hold them for even 6 hours :(.  At first I was skeptical about the flocking, but it seems to be just the thing to keep the ends in place.</li>
    <li> It was bigger than I thought it would be, but it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Initially we thought these kicked butt.  They reached working temperature faster than any other roller set used before.  This is not surprising.  The set is rated at 800 watts, over twice the the rating of other rollers.  Therein lies the problem.  They get hot, so hot that they&#x27;re hard to handle, and they occasionally burn the scalp.  But the fact they reached operating temperature so quickly kept them in use.  Then one morning my wife plugged them in and went into an adjacent room to get dressed.  The rollers had bee plugged in for approximately ten minutes with the lid raised when she returned to use them.  There was a strong odor coming from the roller set.  Upon closer examination she noticed that one roller clip was melting in half.  The roller itself was beginning to melt as well.  Frightened, she quickly unplugged the unit, and allowed it to cool.  The unit was quickly disposed of.</li>
    <li> the first time I tried to use them the ends melted off! and they stank with a gassy odour.</li>
    <li> I have very course and wavy shoulder length hair and I got this to try to smooth out the super frizz I get first thing in the AM. I&#x27;m not very good with styling my hair and I thought this would make it effortless but it&#x27;s very difficult to not make it look like something out of the 70&#x27;s. Currently use this as a towel warmer.</li>
    <li> After seeing a set for a hundred dollars that I did not want to spend...I looked around and found these. I bought them and I am very pleased. I have short hair so I just need a little \\&quot;lift\\&quot; to my thin hair and these do the trick. The clips sure do have a sturdy spring. A few times they jumped right out of my hand while trying to put them on. But I think it&#x27;s just that I am not use to them since they are still so new to me. But I am pleased with them!!!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why this set got negative reviews.  I&#x27;m COMPLETELY new to hot rollers.  I have relatively fine, straight, and long hair that doesn&#x27;t take a curl well.  I grew up using curling irons, but I decided to give hot rollers a try, because I&#x27;m on a bit of a retro kick.  Let me tell you, my hair has never looked so good!  The first time I used the set was a bit of a disaster, but I blame that on my inexperience with using rollers.  After a couple more tries, I have it down.  I let the set heat up longer than the 90 seconds, and I leave the rollers in my hair until they feel cool.  My hair is very long, about halfway down my back.  I use the smaller size rollers in the set for bouncier curls, and the larger rollers for waves.  When I saw the size of the rollers I thought that my hair would be way too long for them, but it&#x27;s so not true.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the curlers melting or anything like that, and I keep the set on for quite some time while I set my hair.  It&#x27;s true that sometimes a hair can get tangled in the slit in the roller, but I&#x27;ve only had that happen when I&#x27;m curling the back of my head.  So, I blame it on my inability to see what I&#x27;m doing and make sure I&#x27;m rolling my hair smoothly.  Overall, I would buy this again and I definitely think that it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this at Target.  I have had a few of the clips melt.  The product did leave my hair very smooth after curling, but my curls went limp shortly.  I used hair product and I have curly/wavy hair that normally holds a curl well.  I think I am better off with a wax-core curlers because it holds the head so much longer.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and need to control the curls and these work perfectly!  The clips hold the rollers in place without pinching or hurting my scalp and I have the confidence that comes with knowing I am not damaging my hair with a curling iron.  I am in my fifties and have used all types of hair curling products throughout my life but these are the best I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Loved it use it everyday wonderful the clips stay in place it heats up just fine everything is perfect</li>
    <li> I was considering paying over $100 for another brand after using my friend&#x27;s set.  I&#x27;m so pleased that I checked on Amazon first and decided on this set.  It contains 8 extra rollers (enough for my whole head), it heats up quicker, and the clips are better.  I also purchased *Conair Hot Roller Super Clips* for using on top of my head so there aren&#x27;t any creases in my hair as another reviewer suggested.  I lived in FL where we have very high humidity and now my curls last for 3 days.  After drying my hair I spray *Aussie Mega* (flexible hold spray) on each small section before I roll it.  I leave the rollers in until completely cooled.  I just run my fingers through my hair to style.  I thought my hair might feel crunchy due to spraying each little section but it feels so soft and I don&#x27;t use extra after styling it nor the following days.  My husband comments on how bouncy my hair is now.</li>
    <li> have to careful to store the rolls otherwise will damage the plastic parts.</li>
    <li> Nice item. Delivered on time. Heat fast, easy to use. Easy to put back to reheat. I don&#x27;t think I like the clamp type, they kink my hair. I should have choose the pin kind.</li>
    <li> Work great, nice case though it is a bit bulky for storing it&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has really thick long hair so we had to keep the stands small.  Bought two</li>
    <li> Omg you get those kardashians waves ❤️</li>
    <li> work great for my hard to curl hair</li>
    <li> These do a nice job of curling my very long hair.  I have received so many complements.  They don&#x27;t burn your hands or your hair.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife had a similar model that she has used for years and it finally died.  She liked that model and wanted another one.  We ordered this one because of the price and free shipping.  It was listed as &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34;, but had obviously been opened and used.  There were hairs in the rollers!  I cleaned it up and my wife is using it, but I still feel a bit &amp;#34;put off&amp;#34; about it not being new.  Side note: My wife comments that you must use caution when putting the rollers and the clips back onto the base or you will melt things.  Be an adult, pay attention, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> These are great.  They heat up quickly and are very easy to use.  I use to hate hot rollers and could never get my hair to set right, but Youtube is my friend.  If you&#x27;ve ever had problems with hot rollers, read or watch tutorials.  They have been ver helpful to me. This morning, I plugged em in, brushed my hair out and rolled my hair. That took a total of about 10 minutes. I slapped some makeup on my face and got dressed---that was another 10 minutes roughly. I took rollers out, sprayed my hair with hair spray and sort of finger combed it.  Bouncy shiny hair in about 20 minutes.  Happy Girl.</li>
    <li> The rollers seem to heat up well, but the clips are impossible.  They are difficult to apply in the first place, and tend to pop off without warning.  Worse, though, is that they leave a very visible crimp in your hair.  Some reviewers note this and say they don&#x27;t use the clips that come with the set for curls around the face -- but I don&#x27;t want a crimp at the top of the curl even o the back of my head.  Other reviewers note you can buy different clips (for about $10!) that won&#x27;t leave a crimp.  Huh?  A hot roller set basically consists of two things:  rollers and clips.  So, if I have to buy something else to replace half of the component parts of the set, then I would call that product a failure.  I returned the set.</li>
    <li> Clips def struggle to stay in long thick hair but overall great curlers!</li>
    <li> Unless you have short hair, do not buy this product. The clips are not designed well enough to be able to hold the curler in your hair securely, it will keep falling out and so takes much more time and patience to roll up and re-roll your hair.  They are nice rollers, but the clips makes it not pleasant and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL.</li>
    <li> My Girlfriend loves it, after watching youtube, she knows how to style it know, she uses every time we go out</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very straight and thought this would help. The curlers are so cheaply made that they don&#x27;t hold that much hair at once. There aren&#x27;t enough curlers for all my hair with the little amount of hair they hold. They come in two different sizes I believe and the biggest size would be for very tight curls. Imagine the small ones! They don&#x27;t heat up enough and the clippers pop out all the time. The box they come in is awful as well, it looks fancy but once you have it in your bathroom there&#x27;s just not a good place for it. You can&#x27;t put anything on top because it has an angle. You can&#x27;t put anything underneath because the curlers slip out. I regret buying this product so much, I wish I had kept the receipt.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I purchased this roller \\&quot;stadium.\\&quot;  If you can get the rollers to stay, the resulting curl is nice, but you have to thin your hair out so much, and even then, the clips aren&#x27;t strong enough to keep them put.  This was so disappointing because these cost more than other sets.  Ideally, you should be able to throw curlers in.  You can&#x27;t do that with this set.  Mine also suddenly stopped working after a handful of uses.  I don&#x27;t recommend these at all!</li>
    <li> I am inexperienced  with hot rollers so I have to say these really exceeded my expectations.  They heat up fast and I love the pink clips!!</li>
    <li> I have used hot rollers for about twenty five years, with all of my previous sets having been the kind with the U-shaped pins used to secure the roller to the head.  When my last set died (a Conair set), I saw these in the store.  I was nearly scared away by the reviews, but was intrigued by the clips with this set.  The first thing I love about these rollers is how quickly they heat up.  They are ready to use within about two minutes (the box says 90 secs, but I think they benefit from warming up just a tad longer).  The clips are SO much easier to use than the pins.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m jabbing my head and they hold very well.  I was concerned that the plastic might be brittle and break easily, but they seem to be fairly substantial. I have seen other reviewers&#x27; complaints about it not heating up sufficiently to curl longer hair; my hair is thick and shoulder-length and curls beautifully with it. Maybe the result wouldn&#x27;t be as nice if my hair were longer.  My only complaint about this curler set is that the footprint is quite large, so it takes a lot of space in the cabinet underneath my sink.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers 2 years go.I  have used  them once or twice a week every since.They are the best thing I have ever seen. They  Heat up fast and my hair looks beautiful, after leaving them on for only 10 minutes. I should add that this is amazing  because My hair is down past my waist (over 3 feet long).</li>
    <li> Even though we followed the directions some of the rollers melted easily. When these are used they did not hold a good curl in my hair.</li>
    <li> Horrible I used it once the half of them melted and I trying to turn it on a second time and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on the worse thing I have ever brought online what a piece of S***</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used &amp;#34;hot rollers&amp;#34; for a long time but I wanted something a little quicker to curl my shoulder length hair in the mornings.  My hair is really straight and I remembered from before that hot roller curls were usually pretty loose and my hair would be almost flat by the end of the day.  I used these rollers for the first time right before I left for work one day.  I put them in (super easy to use) and left them in while I put my make up on.  The actual curlers weren&#x27;t hot to handle and I  really put them in quickly.  When I took them out I had CURLS and I mean I had to end up putting my hair up because I looked like Shirley Temple!  Now after some practice I put them in and take them right back out after I have finished.  I have perfect curls that last even after sleeping on them.  I don&#x27;t have to do anything to my hair the following day!  Love these rollers and would recommend them to everyone!  I loved the price also!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my friend has the same set and I loved using hers, so I bought myself the same set. When the package came in the mail, the Remington box that the hot rollers were in was badly damaged and when I opened it up, I could tell that this had been a recently used set. I opened the case that the rollers are in and all of the clips were thrown about which wasn&#x27;t a big deal until I was moving the rollers and in several of them were stray hairs! I&#x27;m completely disgusted, only because I bought this under the impression that I had bought a new set that would be delivered quickly instead of getting used hair rollers from a different vendor. The fact that there were black hairs wrapped all around the clips that I could see without picking them up is what grossed me out. Extremely disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase! I read countless reviews for different sets, and decided to take a chance on this one. I have extremely long straight hair that doesn&#x27;t like to curl. This set has just the right amount of curlers for my hair and, when left in over night, gives me beautiful curls! :-) I&#x27;ve only used it three times, but so far so good!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty, seems a nice quality, but clips are too flimsy to really hold hair in them and they leave a noticeable crease in your hair. Had to return.</li>
    <li> no real curl formation at all ... I expected loose bouncy curl and got nothing..barely a bend in my hair</li>
    <li> I have not had these long enough to give a long term rating.  The curl is good and stays in longer than other rollers.  I was not keen on the clips, they do not hold the roller in place against the scalp and allow the roller to flop around.  I prefer keeping the roller taught to the scalp to add lift and body at the root and these fail in that respect, but still worth it to keep using them.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my wife as a gift and she loves them .The description allowed me to match what she said she wanted with the rollers I bought and she was so surprised that I actually was listening</li>
    <li> This product is is a cheap bad smelling plastic which as soon as you switch it on it starts melting the plastic sides of the rollers within a couple of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;As they advertised &amp;#34;CERAMIC&amp;#34; I thought that it made from metal (which is heating the rollers ) and the rest is ceramic material.&lt;br /&gt;But it is just plastic and metal which of course it is melting everything !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I can not believe that Remington does such low quality product !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very, very disappointed and I do not recommend this product  !!!!!</li>
    <li> Recently ordered the ceramic hair rollers.  Thought the price could not be beat.  I plugged in the unit and when I went to use the rollers hair was left on the rollers.  Didn&#x27;t even want to try them.  The return process was smooth and a quick refund was provided.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. It takes up a lot of room but they get hot fast and curl great.</li>
    <li> I read the bad reviews and decided to get it anyway. I got it at a really good price. They heat up super hot and the clips hold the rollers in place. I have really fine shoulder length hair so they work great for me, but they also work for my niece who has thicker mid back length hair. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The clips heat-up and burn my scalp.  Also not good on short hair.  Hard to wrap my hair around the rods.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, after clips &amp; curlers removed (when cooled), excellent all-day hold.  I took the reviewer&#x27;s tip who said let it heat up once or twice first before actually using.</li>
    <li> This product is very tricky. I have extremely long hair (about 24&amp;#34;) and these make it so curly it&#x27;s almost up to my shoulders.  I need to experiement more with it to see if I can use it or just turn it into a gift for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is a really nice product.  The rollers are made very well, they don&#x27;t burn or rip out hair.  The heated clips confused me at first but they are the key to these roller&#x27;s success. Each roller really does hold A LOT of hair!</li>
    <li> I received these hair rollers just a couple of days after ordering them but when I opened the amazon box that it came in, I noticed that the box with the rollers had been resealed.  I opened that box and the rollers had been used and every roller had been melted and there was someone else&#x27;s hair on most of the rollers.  Very disappointed as this was my first amazon order.</li>
    <li> I bought this hot roller set 2 years ago. I really like it. The ceramic heated clip really helps to smooth the hair and transfer heat. My friend bought the same set and didn&#x27;t like it as much as I did, so she gave it to me. I transferred all the large size rollers to one set and I use them all over my head. It doesn&#x27;t take a long time for my hair to curl either. It probably takes longer to roll my hair than to curl it with these rollers. I use hair wrapper papers with these rollers and everything comes out nice and straight. Another suggestion is to use some type of serum on the ends of your hair for protection against drying or breakage.</li>
    <li> Not enough for tight curls, just loose curls. Better keep your curling iron out if you want more than lazy twists, but if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, than it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my 28 yr old daughter had on her Christmas list and she just loved it. She has quite long hair and thought it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Have worn my hair short for years as it is very fine and no longer takes a perm well.  I decided to try and grow it out but tired of trying to keep it nice with a curling iron.  These curlers were the answer.  The best I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers. They are easy to use and heat up quickly, and no burnt fingers.  They can be a little too hot if the edges rest against ears or your neck. I have shoulder length hair that is hard get to hold a curl. The curls from these are loose and bouncy and hold all day. They do take up a bit of counterspace, but it is worth it. I have paid more for rollers in the past, but non worked this well.</li>
    <li> These curlers are easy to use and work well.</li>
    <li> These work great. They heat fast and there is plenty of rollers to get the job done. It takes up a lot of space on the counter but that&#x27;s the price of beauty, right.</li>
    <li> Love the set I get with the rollers. Not too crazy about the indentations I get from the clips.</li>
    <li> They are a big set but work great and I love the clips--so much easier to set my hair now -very pleased-</li>
    <li> I like that i can use it the night before and keep them in while sleeping and wake up with my curls looking fabulous</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. I read the reviews and like many I have an older Remington set that I really liked. These rollers are similar enough although those clips are just impossible. They don&#x27;t hold hair very well at all. I did as others and ordered the Conair Hot Roller Super Clips the same day. I don&#x27;t like those either. What saved my butt though was using the clips that were with my old Remington set. So if you have an older set, you can toss it out, but hang onto those clips! This set has a large footprint on my counter. Not good for travel. One other minor disappointment was that the set has only two sizes. I find that I miss those four small rollers that my old set had. Are there no women involved with Remington? Anyone who uses rollers would never sit in a meeting and declare these being good enough as is. A little disappointed. PROS: It seems to heat up soon enough. I like to get my hair rolled in less than five minutes from the time I plug it in. I also enjoy that these will set in just a few minutes.</li>
    <li> The clips are not strong enough to hold more than a small amount of hair and do not stay in place. I had to use the clips from my old rollers to hold the curlers in place. I also don&#x27;t like that the curlers do not have an on/off switch, as the plug is difficult to reach.</li>
    <li> I have difficult to curl thick hair and I don&#x27;t have a great deal of luck with curling irons.  After following the advice of other reviewers for this product I was very satisified.  I have continued to use these regularly to get loose volume rich curls in my hair.  I make sure my hair is clean and fully dry and that I let the rollers heat fully before I apply them.  Then I take sections of hair and spritz them lightly with hairspray and then roll them up.  I leave these in for at least 15-20 mins but sometimes just until they are totally cool.  The longer you leave them in the better the curls.  I could leave them \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; but instead and brush through these curls to get a lot of volume and gentle rolling curls.  I have gotten a lot of compliments about the hairstyles!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my Mom for her birthday and she loves them! She had the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; Hot Rollers from when I was a little girl, those things were so ready to be tossed! She says this set is great on her hair!</li>
    <li> I have been around for 63 years, and I have tried many hot hair curlers.  These are the absolute best!  They don&#x27;t hurt to put in your hair, and the clips works great!  They  heat up in about 3 minutes.  The two sizes are perfect for my shoulder-length hair.</li>
    <li> IMy hair is REALLY thick &amp; curly, after blow drying my hair these heat clips really helped in adding volume &amp; making my layers look awesome. It is hard to find products like these that can keep up with my hair texture. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> So I received the curlers only to open the package and see nothing but NASTY disgusting hair on every single roller. Not to mention a roller case with water stains all over it!!</li>
    <li> Worst purchase for my hair ever! The box is huge. Rolls are getting very-very hot, so I burned my fingers. You can see a mark on your hair after clips. And the result is very bad. I have owned some hot rollers before, but those are the worst one.</li>
    <li> The curlers don&#x27;t hold much hair.  If you have thick hair, these won&#x27;t work well for you.  I used all curlers to curl my hair.  The clips don&#x27;t grasp tight, so you end up with a limp, loose curl.</li>
    <li> First I must say that these rollers get VERY hot so be careful not to burn your fingers. It seems as though there is no thermostat on the heating component and the rollers just keep getting hotter &amp; hotter. I do like that there are a lot of rollers in this set, although I wish they were larger. One of the selling points of this set is that the clips also heat up therefore your hair gets heat from both the roller &amp; the clip. This is true, however, the clips are basically useless as they do not grip well and slide right off the minute you  move your head. I have average thickness, layered hair which is shoulder-length so the problem isn&#x27;t my hair, but the clips themselves. I have to use big salon clips to keep the rollers in and forget about using the clips that came with the set.  I don&#x27;t recommend this set to anyone if they plan on using the clips that come with it.</li>
    <li> Bought them for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves them!  They heat up very quickly and don&#x27;t leave a mark from the clip</li>
    <li> I thought these would not leave a mark in my hair where the clip goes but it was worse then my previous set of curlers. They also don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl fast. It is a very bulky item to store as well. Looks good but not any better then my old set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and I love these to set hair. I think it&#x27;s a great price, they work well and theres enough rollers especially larger sizes for long hair. I would purchase these again and I would recommend them to anyone, besides the pink clips are so girly!</li>
    <li> Got it in time for new years eve. They warm up quickly and loved the curl on my hair.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I just got my product in the mail about a hour ago. I decided to open it up just to check it out. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I just wanted to take a look at it. The product looked used and I thought I was buying a new product. I am not even sure if it&#x27;s new because the plastic part to the roller seemed to be a little brown on one roller as if it has been used a few times and the heat brown it. Also one of the pink clips look melted at the ends of it. I will try it but I just wasn&#x27;t happy with how it looked.</li>
    <li> They smoked the first time I turned them on, and are now useless. Not suitable for Australia</li>
    <li> Great purchase love it</li>
    <li> Beats a curling iron hands down.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of this particular brand of curlers. The minute mine stopped working, I immediately ordered a new set.</li>
    <li> After searching for \\&quot;jumbo curlers for long hair\\&quot; I decided to purchase this remington set. Big mistake. I&#x27;ve literally used it once and they were absolutely horrible. My hair is medium-long but I have a lot of it and these curlers are pretty much worthless. Not on only that, the clips are plastic and if they&#x27;re not placed correctly on the curlers while heating up, they will melt. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these rollers for 3 years now. They still work great!&lt;br /&gt;My hear is long (middle of my back) and pretty thick - and I don&#x27;t even need to use all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for novices: alternate small and big rollers, and also alternate direction in which you roll them. This will give you more natural look. Spray your hair with heat protective spray and with curling spray or with regular hair spray first - let it dry half way - then start putting in rollers. This will ensure that your hair holds curl, even if it is thick and straight like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;number of rollers - great if you have lots of hair&lt;br /&gt;ease of use - reviewers who said the rollers fell off have no idea how to use this product&lt;br /&gt;durability - this product will last you for years&lt;br /&gt;result - you will get great looking curls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;bulky - hard to pack if you are travelling. the lid broke off during transportation on one of my trips, but the rollers are still working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy!</li>
    <li> I actually own 4 sets of these -- and one resides at the home of each of my children who live at a distance.  When I fly to their house to visit, I have all I need to keep looking like a contemporary grandmother!  Really like the size choices and the heat is just right.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, works extremly well for the price! Just remember to take the clips off before plugging it in!</li>
    <li> i can see why people had a hard time with these. i personally didnt. they heat fast thats true but i let them heat up for 5-10 mins. i have long super thick hair thats curly in its own right. there just not the pretty curls that this gives me. if you are having trouble with these dont send them back. wash your hair the night before (if you have oily hair invest in a good dry shampoo) and use a thermal spray on each section of hair. make sure you are really brushing out the tangles before hand. ive been using curlers for years and those are what made it user for me (and most people in general) if it doesnt work after that send them back</li>
    <li> These heated hair rollers are wonderful. They heat up quickly &amp; are gentle on my hair. I can adjust the degree of curl just by the time that I leave them on my hair. This is the 2nd set I&#x27;ve bought; one for my home &amp; one for our vacation cabin. I&#x27;ve had the 1st set for well over a year and they are still as good as new.</li>
    <li> great rolers, get hot fast and my VERY straight hair stays curly all day. the container is HUGE though, so not ideal to travel with,</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! great for my hair and lil ones!!! well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Really like. Easy-to-use.  They slip some while using or I&#x27;d give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> These things came highly recommended but i&#x27;m not all that impressed. They are a good set, dont get me wrong. They just don&#x27;t live up to all the hype. They get very hot so they are very hard to handle if your not used to it. I automatically grab the rollers from the side out of habit and that&#x27;s the hottest part of these rollers. Wrapping these will take some getting used to unless u buy a cotton/heat glove. The set is big and bulky so not very travel friendly. But they seem stable and see very cute. I love that they come with heated clips. Great idea! Overall I like it, but not in love with it.....yet!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these because I have very thick hair. It works very well on my hair and really gets it to straighten out a bit without all the hard work of a hair dryer. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love them! Use them everyday!</li>
    <li> High grade product but I was a little disappointed in the outcome of the curls. Need more rollers than expected to achieve anything but soft waves. If you are looking for soft waves, these rollers are the deal. If you expect a head full of curls, get ready for a let down.</li>
    <li> I have waist length very straight hair, so as you know, it is a nightmare to curl. These curlers do the job. There are enough of them to do my whole head. And I start at the back/bottom. I section off my hair so it doesn&#x27;t tangle. And curl bottom to top and back to front. Then when my whole head is in the rollers I WAIT at least 30 minutes until all of the rollers are cold. Then I gently unroll in the same sequence. I again wait at least 10 min. I use my fingers to combine the curls. This product is a miracle for me. Big, beautiful curls that last and last. Another secret shush, is my product. Gotta love Paul Mitchell&amp;#34; Hot Off The Press&amp;#34;, which makes the whole &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; possible. Seriously if you follow these instructions and use the product, YOU will have the curls of your dreams too.</li>
    <li> I have a graduated bob, with the front hair below chin length, and the hair at the back about 4\\&quot; at the shortest. The two sizes in this set are just right for the smooth, underswept style I favor. The clips have a firm grip so they don&#x27;t come slithering out of my fine hair like other &#x27;clip&#x27; types do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About that clip, it does leave an indention in the hair where the top lip rests. I have read that if you put tissue paper (or perm rod paper) to buffer it, you can avoid the indention. Have not tried it out myself yet. But if this is given as a gift, the recipient may not know to come here and read it, and they have indents in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The napped roll keeps a good grip on the hair. I would advise touching only the nap, not the raised edges of the roller, to protect your fingers from the heat. Keep in mind that the clips are on the rollers while they heat, so they are quite warm, but not excessive. I had to hold my hair ends kind of bunched against the nap, then start rolling. My bleached ends don&#x27;t obey very well, but once they are on, they roll up quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that because the clips are on the rollers while heating, you must have them correctly lined up. Otherwise, you might melt the clips...other reviews have mentioned this, and I can see how it might happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this size; neither too large nor too small in the diameters of the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this if I discover anything else important about the set&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> These get really hot quickly.  Which is good, but they kind of burn my head a tad.  I don&#x27;t like that.  The big curlers are too big for what I like, there are 8 smaller ones, that is almost enough for my hair, I need one more.  So I have to use the larger curler for my bangs.  I just wish there was one more smaller curler.  It is nice that the other clip gets hot also, but sometimes that causes the line in my hair, I don&#x27;t see it, only when I take the curler&#x27;s out.  My hair is curly, so this just controls the curl, I put them in, take them out, and then just put my hands in my hair and shake the curls.  On top, I do run the comb through that and get height, so I see no lines.</li>
    <li> Clips don&#x27;t hold the hair that well. Also doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; more of a wave effect.</li>
    <li> The heat clip hair curlers work great.  The only draw back it the clips can get really hot.</li>
    <li> pretty typical hair rollers. woohoo</li>
    <li> Clips gets to hot to handle, and you have to be very careful that you don&#x27;t burn your ear when rolling.</li>
    <li> i like these a lot! the clips work fantastic to hold the curler in.  I spent a while looking for this type bc I never had luck with the old fashion style that has the pins. They also heat up quickly.</li>
    <li> these are great curlers! the velvet coating around the curlers help protect the hair from burning. I love these better than my curling iron. My hairdresser was happy to hear i&#x27;m using electric curlers rather than the curling iron so that I&#x27;m not destroying my hair any longer.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the hair rollers  - haven&#x27;t used rollers for years, and it is good to have them back again.  Only place I have trouble with them - is the very front.  Can&#x27;t figure out a way to keep the roller and clip from falling forward - otherwise, I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I like that this set has 20 rollers (medium and large).  I have very thick, frizzy, mid back length hair and this works reasonably well to help keep the frizz down when I don&#x27;t want to completely straighten my hair.  I would recommend purchasing the Spilo Professional Electric Roller Clips to use with this as the clips that come with the rollers do leave marks, often uncurl, or pop off.</li>
    <li> I bought this hot roller set at a department store last week because I wanted more larger curlers than the other sets available had. Not even having these curlers for a week, the clips have already started melting. And the roller/clip combination leaves indentations in your hair. Never had any of these issues in my former rollers...only reason I replace it was the lid god cracked after continual use for 4 years. Find something else, in the long run, I believe you will be happier. This is really poorly designed.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter in law, she is really happy with how they work, she did say watch your fingers she burnt hers a couple of times...other than that she enjoys how quickly they curl her hair..:)</li>
    <li> This is my first hot roller set and the first one I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t like the fact that the clips dont hold my hair very well. My hair easily falls out of the clip and I takes up more of my time to redo it. Once its plugged in for too long, the hot rollers get too hot to handle as well. Overall, I wont repurchase this or recommend it to my friends. I think there are better ones out there.</li>
    <li> I purchased the rollers as a gift for my wife ,they curl fine but  If the rollers are not placed just so in the crate they melt.&lt;br /&gt; She has only used them only 3 times and 4 of the clips have melted and stuck to the bar.Not pleased ,would not recommend.</li>
    <li> These curlers heat up quickly so you need to simply plug and roll. While I had to adjust the length of time I left them in my hair so that I didn&#x27;t get tight curls, I have figured out the timing and heat to get a lovely wave. A great set if you don&#x27;t mind a bulky unit in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers. At first I was having trouble handling the roller till I figured out how to roll and then clip. Once I was able to roll them up it was a great experience.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. The rollers heat up in no time, so if she has to be ready in 5 minutes, that&#x27;s no problem now. She loves how the clips hold her hair (she used pins previously) and she only needs to keep them in for 5 to 10 minutes, then bouncy wavy curls. She prefers to brush her hair afterward, but if I do her hair for her, I just run my fingers through it and give her a spritz of hair spray and she&#x27;s on her way. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best heated hair roller set I have ever owned. It&#x27;s fast heating and only takes minutes to style your hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> I liked the clips that go with the hair rollers better than the wire ones that won&#x27;t stay in place. The rollers heat up really quick.</li>
    <li> Love the clips and also that they stay attached to the roller when not in use. Makes perfect curls. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  The curlers are fine for the back and sides of head.  However, on the top and the crown the curlers flop over and will not stay secure.  Wish I could return it for a refund!!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder-length, fine hair (but lots of it) and I can only curl about the top half (or bottom, depends on where I start)so this set is useless to me. If I use thicker strands, the rollers won&#x27;t hold; if I take smaller strands -- well, I end up with half my head full of curls and the other half straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, most rollers are relatively small and I personally don&#x27;t like small, perm-like curls....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for nice design and quality, velvety feel of the rollers.</li>
    <li> This is my third set. Does anyone use the small rollers? There should be more bigger ones with only a very few small ones. Or just have a big set and a small set.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit and was so excited about the effectiveness of the heated clips pairing with the heated rollers. The clips don&#x27;t hold the roller in place. I have medium/long hair and couldn&#x27;t do anything to stop the rollers that I did on the top of my head from flopping around. Also, the clips left funny dents in my hair.</li>
    <li> I got these at Tar Get, and instead of reading reviews online like I normally do before buying something I got them on a whim while out and I thought since they were a little more spendy compared to other items for sale there, so thought they would be worth it.  WRONG!  They do not stay in my hair- the clips SUCK big time and I spend more time trying to strategize how to put the clip in so that they do not fall out.  Every time I go to use these I get angry (hence why I decided to write a review) because I spend so much stupid time trying to make them stay in.  If you have a bunch of little claw clips you can use those in place of what comes with the roller set and boom I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d be happy with the set.  If you are like me and don&#x27;t, they are worthless.  AGH.  Seriously did they test these rollers on REAL peoples hair first?  I try these with a little chunk of hair, with my shorter bang pieces, etc. and it&#x27;s the stupid pink clips- they are plain out WORTHLESS!  The clips need teeth and they have none.  Whoever made these must have been bald or had thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I used them for the first time today. It&#x27;s gonna take a few tries to determine what way I roll them to get the right style for me. Cheap? No, not at all. They have soft velvet type feel so try hold and to slide around. They get really hot but again just play with them awhile and you will get the hang of how to use em correctly. I like em and it was worth the $$$ :0)</li>
    <li> When I received the curlers I read the limited instructions and plugged them in...all the sudden they started smoking.  I realized the clips were burning.  So I&#x27;m assuming the clips should have been removed.  Okay, rookie mistake I thought.  So I decided to give them a try since no real damage was done.  I&#x27;ve used them about 5 times so far and the curls look great at first but don&#x27;t hold very well.  I&#x27;ve tried every sort of product and each time it holds a little better, but not what I expected.  I&#x27;ve traveled with them on vacation even though the packaging isn&#x27;t travel friendly.  I didn&#x27;t think to make sure each curler is set perfectly and again when I plugged it in the plastic on the curlers melted.  I don&#x27;t heat the curlers with the clips on , o I&#x27;m not sure if they are supposed to be heated or not.  If you heat with the clips they melt, if you heat without the clips and the curler isn&#x27;t perfectly aligned the curler melts.  I would not recommend these curlers to anyone.</li>
    <li> This totally didn&#x27;t work for me, and usually I am very handy with hair set items.  This heated very quickly, the only positive I found with this item.  The problems were that the rollers were too heavy for my fine hair and wouldn&#x27;t stay in, and the rollers got very hot, so even with care my fingers were burned.  The rollers even felt too hot on my scalp (maybe worse because of my fine (not terribly thick) hair.  In any case, I immediately gave them away.  Also, the set does take a lot of counter room, but I had been warned of that from the reviews.</li>
    <li> I had older Remington hot rollers that I used all the time.  But they finally quick working.  I shopped a lot in stores but never saw anything that compared.  Now that I have this one, I am very happy.  Heats quickly.  Easy to curl.  Great place to store clips and curlers.  Very good product!</li>
    <li> Works great and good price.  Use with setting gel or solution to make curls last.  Curls hold well.  Fast and Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am new to hot rollers and this is my first set.  I have very long, fine, layered hair and the rollers curl it very easily.  The rollers heat up very fast and the flocked design make them easy to use.  The clips stay on decently well, but sometimes leave an indent.  However, if you&#x27;re going for the bouncy, slightly messy, curled look, you won&#x27;t notice the occasional indent.  I&#x27;m happy with the set overall for the price!</li>
    <li> There is a youtube video with a tutorial.  This product works great - I have SUPER long hair (and it is thick) and was afraid I would need two sets in order to do all of my hair.  But that is not the case, the one set works great and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> Really like this curling system...do wish that it had an off/on switch...but it does get the job done when you are in a hurry...</li>
    <li> These are the best set of rollers I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;ve had a lot. Love tat the clips store on the rollers, I was always losing my clips with other sets. There are a lot of complaints an here about the clips not gripping, actually these work better than the three previous sets I&#x27;ve had. The only complaint I have so far is an odor on startup, but I assume this will fade, many other of my Sets had an initial odor too. Also there&#x27;s a lot of fuzz on the clips from the velvet, so they need to be wiped down and the inside of the appliance should be wiped out. Also theres no switch. But they heat up fast and set fast.</li>
    <li> i only used it once.  The larger curlers didn&#x27;t create a curl so much.  The smaller ones did.  However, i may not have kept them in long enough.  Also, i may have tried them with too much hair in the curler.  i will try again.  i do, however, like the clips.  They stayed in my hair good enough.</li>
    <li> I have not used a better hot roller set! Very pleased! My curls last all day without even using hairspray!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these about a year ago.  I agree with the other reviews about how hot the rollers are.  It is hard to handle them when your fingers a being burned.  I have learned to wrap my hair in the rollers quickly!  The clips do loosen and sometimes the rollers fall out.  I have medium length hair which is a little thick.  I&#x27;m presently looking for rollers that grab the hair better and will not burn my fingers.  The upside to these rollers is that they heat fast and do make nice curls.  So if you don&#x27;t mind loose rollers or a bit of burning on your fingers then give them a try, I did and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m going to replace them.</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible.  Clamps would NOT stay in, therefore, the rollers wouldn&#x27;t either.  I&#x27;m returning these and looking for others.  i should have realized that they weren&#x27;t worth it when I saw them at a thrift store.</li>
    <li> One of the clips were broke but I will still keep the rollers I saved clips from my old one</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these, heat up fast, easy to use, best I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> They do put a nice curl in my medium length hair, but do not stay in very well.  You cannot move around without them falling out if you move your head around.  The clip does leave a \\&quot;line\\&quot; in your hair!</li>
    <li> A good product, but for fine hair the rollers tend to fall out with the clip. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for fine hair but for others it would work great.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that something that stays in the hair for 2-5 minutes can actually give you curl or even some body.  However, this product is everything they say it is.  I always have a permanent in my hair but had come to that time when I needed a perm but alas no time! Ordered this, heated for 2 minutes. Easily placed in hair with pink clips. Left curlers in for literally 5 minutes and had curl that lasted all day.  I might forego getting a perm now since this works so well. One of the other reviewers cautioned about letting the pink clips touch the hot metal.  Heed that advice because the clips will be scarred or look wonky - they still work but it does look out of shape (well, so do I but that is another story).&lt;br /&gt;This was priced at $40 in a large box store.  I spent 25 percent less but even at the orignal price I would purchase this product again because it is great.</li>
    <li> I picked this set up at Target looking for a moderately priced set. I have really thick, long hair which will dry wavy on its own, but I normally blow dry straight and subsequently curl. I have a set of 12 1.5 inch flocked rollers which I use just to pump in some volume to my hair which are of pretty good quality (Babyliss brand) but I get the feeling after ordering this set that my hair doesn&#x27;t like the velvety coating on the rollers. It looks good as soon as I take them out. My hair curls VERY well, but these rollers (flocked style in general) don&#x27;t give the defined look I&#x27;m going for. I&#x27;m not saying I want Annie ringlets, but I also don&#x27;t want to spend time rolling my hair if it&#x27;s going to end up looking the same way (wavy) that it would if I would have let it air dry, thus sparing it the heat of the blowdryer and the rollers. The look I generally go for is the defined, large, voluminous curls that most people would define as &amp;#34;Victoria&#x27;s Secret model&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;pageant girl&amp;#34; hair. I am a pageant girl so the right look is important to me. For some reason finding rollers that aren&#x27;t velvet coated seems to be impossible lately. I think I&#x27;ll just suck it up and pay for the Babyliss 30 set that&#x27;s over $100 without velvet. It will hold better than these guys. That being said, if you like the look of dropped curls, loose waves, etc. This is a good inexpensive set for you.</li>
    <li> This set was recommended by a friend and I am so happy I got them.  I have a little baby and being able to throw these in and walk around the house getting other things done is amazing.  The entire unit is bulky.  We have a small bathroom and it barely fits in the corner.  Also, you can&#x27;t leave it plugged in.  There is no on/off switch.  You plug it in to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a hairstylist, is gives great curl, but don&#x27;t expect the same exact results as a curling iron.  You have less control of the direction the curl is facing with these.</li>
    <li> clips aren&#x27;t strong enough</li>
    <li> I had never used hot rollers before and didn&#x27;t know what to buy. After reading other customers&#x27; reviews of this product, I would recommend it to almost anyone. I have long, thick, layered hair and the rollers worked for me!</li>
    <li> Works great. Takes up a lot of space though.</li>
    <li> These work beautifully.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick results :)</li>
    <li> They do work and are nice has a good amoint of rollers i would recommend on buying them and are very fast on heating as in making the curls</li>
    <li> The best product, it really curls my hair fast. I love it! No more sleeping in rollers an shaving flat curls.</li>
    <li> The only reason I rated this as a 3 is because the rollers are small.  They are not jumbo or super jumbo.  If you like the typical 1980&#x27;s rollers with a quick heat setting and one that will get the job done then these rollers will be perfect for you.  THEY WORK AND THEY WORK WELL.  They aren&#x27;t however going to give you lots of volume with little curl.  The curl is small and tight, perfect for an updo that needs to loosen over a few hours.  Perfect curl for a windy day.  Perfect if you want the hot rolled look of the 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Work well but buyers should be aware that they are selling used rollers. The box was damaged and cover cracked when I opened it for the first time.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use,  can make beautiful curls less than 10 MIn.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> The clips do not keep the curlers from slipping out of your hair.  They may work for someone with thick or curly hair, but did not work well at all in my fine, straight hair.  Will be passing this set along to someone else.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate this product, and if my husband hadn&#x27;t cut up the box I would have sent it back.  Now it just sits in the drawer.</li>
    <li> Didnt work as well as described for hard to roll thich hair like mine. However worked perfectly for my daughters hair</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my friend. Both her and her daughters loved it. The curl was amazing and it held for a long time. I thought she looked great. She said it was easy and quick.</li>
    <li> It may because my hair is very hard, i could not see any curls after using it and accidentally burn my finger. Maybe I use it in the wrong way?</li>
    <li> I have used many different kinds of rollers through the years and these are the best. I have very very thick fine hair. I wash it and throw it up in a messy bun with a clip when it is wet. The next day I use these rollers. They are fast and the only set I have ever had enough rollers to roll all of my hair at once. I roll my hair, shake it out and the curls last for two days without any hairspray or product. It removes all the kink lines in the top from my messy bun and curls the ends quite well. I have gotten lots if positive comments and it only takes minutes to do. I am amazed by the negative comments because I have never found better hot rollers in decades.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had the hinged clips. They are more secure than the other style. The velvet finish keeps them from slipping.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a Christmas gift for my daughter.  A friend had used these on her hair and she liked the look and asked for  some.  They heat up very quickly as advertised and with just a few rollers were easy enough to catch on how to use properly. They are a bit hard for my preteen to use on her own but seems she will just need to practice.  I did use them several times on her and they provide quick full curls.  There are two sizes in this set and can give you different types of tightness to curls also depending on how long you leave them in.  I would definately buy again if needed and fully met my expectations.</li>
    <li> First, the packaging came in dented and bashed up for me also, but the product itself was new. I can&#x27;t keep the curls through more than a few hours though - I think it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Love these! They work perfectly!</li>
    <li> The box looked like it went through a hurricane. The box was all taped up and buldging at the bottom, looked very used like something you would get at a garage sale. It must of been a return. The only reason I am not returning it is because I need it for a gift soon. I HOPE the product works. I will have to take the curlers out of the box in order to give as a gift because the box is so beat up!!</li>
    <li> My mother had fine, thin, straight heair. These do the job for a good old fashioned curl. Last all day for her. Super easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give these 5 stars, as they really work well and hold in a lot of heat. The only issue is that my hair gets stuck in the opening of the roller, at times. Not a deal breaker. I&#x27;d still recommend.</li>
    <li> I received one of these sets for Christmas and love it. I use it a lot as it heats up fast and very easy to use. I have thick and long hair (reaches the small of my back) and it gives me the nice curls that I fail at getting with my curling iron and they last all day. I ended up buying a second one on amazon because I have so much hair and I do not regret it at all. Wonderful product if you like heavy curls or just wavy you can do it all! It is also a very pretty set so it sits out and doesn&#x27;t have to be pulled out of my closet when I want to use it.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of these type of sets and the clips eventually get lost. These clips are attached during storage so they will probably not get lost. The clips  cause the rollers to slip or &amp;#34;flop down&amp;#34; when used, however. They cannot be tightly attached. The set works OK in summary.</li>
    <li> I had the same set that I have used for years. I decided to replaced them for a new set. I received the new set and realized that the clips did not have the ceramic clips on the inside like my old set. I reported this to amazon and received no response. They don&#x27;t work properly without the ceramic clips. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great item curls human  hair great</li>
    <li> Price was right, and this is a good little curler for my very fine hair. Unlike several reviewers,  I&#x27;ve had no problems with the slits which fit into the holders.</li>
    <li> I wanted a good set of rollers and I surely found them in this set. Highly recommened to anyone! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased the Remington H9000 Pearl Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Curlers!  They heat up in no time at all and I only have to keep them in 10-15 minutes to get great, long-lasting curls.  I purchased this set to replace a set I had for a &amp;#34;million years&amp;#34; and these are absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> Curlers were a bit too big for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will pass it along to granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Fun with these and the great news I am not buring my fingers as I set my hair. Lots of curlers easy to pack away and travel with. Easy clsoe lid to keep product clean and ready to use</li>
    <li> Daughter-in-law loved them</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the Hair Rollers.  Super fast curl.  Bought one for my daughter too</li>
    <li> The curlers get too hot.  The clips easily melt to the base if they aren&#x27;t situated perfectly on the mount.  The clips are AWFUL for holding the curlers in place.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers, they get hot really fast, and are so easy to manuver, my curls come out great... I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on the curls, and are so much easier then a curling iron or other roller sets.&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccommend these!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old set that I had. I was pleased how fast it heated up, but once I put the curlers in my hair, they slipped and fell out. I got some curl but not alot. The velcro does not hold your hair in place and the clips just make the curlers fall in all kinds of ways. If they don&#x27;t fall out, they go to the side and hang.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product is quick and styles great  and stays long!  The only problem I have is that I&#x27;m always close to burning my ears and neck cuz it&#x27;s so hot.  But I love this thing!  I let my then future mother in law borrow it for a wedding and she loved it so we bought her one for mother&#x27;s day... or was it her birthday?  My sister gave me mine and my other sister is constantly borrowing it.  It saves so much time.</li>
    <li> I read previous reviews on the seller after I order this product and I was a little nervous. I have to say, not only did the seller send me this in a timely manner, the product itself is outstanding. My hair has retained voume and no frizz and the curls are long standing. I love both the Seller and the Product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love these hot rollers. They heat up very quickly and the curl and volume that I get with these last for days.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, works with my fine, straight hair to give body and/or curls with staying power. Not as damaging as a curling iron, and easier to use. Not much more to say than that!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Wish it had an on/off switch so I didn&#x27;t have to plug and unplug to use but delivers a great curl and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  The clips on the hairsetter need to be redesigned.  They don&#x27;t stay in.  They were literally popping off my head.  I&#x27;ve set my hair for years and was really excited to have something other than the metal pins.  Love the case design and color and shape.  Just need a gripping texture on the clips.</li>
    <li> This is the best set of hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever owned in 25 years of hot roller ownership.  The rollers stay in my hair, and are comfortable.  I get a really nice, even curl.  The rollers heat evenly and get hot, but not so hot they burn my ears or fingers.  They&#x27;re just the right size for the style I like which is more than volume but less than CURLY! I get a definite curl, but it&#x27;s soft and flattering and not overly styled looking.  I wish wish wish they made a travel size just like them, because this set if much too large to travel with, and I hate using any other set than this one.  I can&#x27;t swear they&#x27;ll work as well for all hair types and styles as they do for mine, but these are so perfect for me I&#x27;m tempted to buy another set in case they ever stop making them.</li>
