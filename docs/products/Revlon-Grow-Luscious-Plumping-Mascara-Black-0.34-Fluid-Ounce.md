### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have used a mascara wand with this, and it makes my lashes look great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad for a drugstore mascara product, but it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, either.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m one happy chick when i see it in my mailbox :)</li>
      <li>I love ordering ny mascara from amazon!</li>
      <li>I think I got a good deal, its huge for the price I paid, It came in a huger box also, lol, but it puts on nicely.</li>
      <li>Nothing really amazing about this product.</li>
      <li>The formula is nice, and stays on without flaking.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so thrilled about</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible product, by any means.  </li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>Most mascaras are just lengthening or just thickening.</li>
      <li>,Blackest Black is amazing it is definatley the best Mascara i have purchased in years</li>
      <li>and i also purchased the Revlon Powder Blush,Berry Rich and am extremely satisfied with this product as well</li>
      <li>And the applicator that comes with it is easy to use</li>
      <li>The wand is huge and ungainly, meaning you&#x27;ll splotch all over the place.</li>
      <li>Seems to be worth the buy!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>What worked for me was applying this mascara with a quick, light hand.  </li>
      <li>First of all the brush is HUGE.</li>
      <li>love the color, which is a nice black.  </li>
      <li>It has the standard kind of bristly brush, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with clumping with this mascara.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite the right one for me.</li>
      <li>This went right in the trash.</li>
      <li>I have the waterproof variety, and it has been an absolute waste of money and has caused a great deal of frustration.</li>
      <li>Also, the way it seems to make my lashes bigger (more voluminous, plumped, or whatever) is by making them stick together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Revlon&#x27;s regular Grow Luscious formula.</li>
      <li>Could have easily bought a cheaper bottle that has the same results.</li>
      <li>is that this seems to take awhile to dry, so if I blink after I apply it to my top lashes, some of it will end up on my bottom lashes, as well.  </li>
      <li>It does add good volume and length, it&#x27;s just hard to get it on without clumping lashes together,you really have to keep working the brush through to get it spread out evenly.</li>
      <li>Until I get ready to try something else, I&#x27;m sticking with this for now.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really see any volume or plumping, and cannot say there is any growth as a result.  </li>
      <li>I then learned to work with it since I was already stuck with the new tube!  </li>
      <li>in particular).  </li>
      <li>This mascara really makes my eyelashes seem long and full.</li>
      <li>It falls pretty much in the middle of the pack, in terms of mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this mascara actually makes your eyelashed grow, but it definitely makes them look super looooooooonnnnggggg when you&#x27;re wearing it!</li>
      <li>I admit, at first I thought this mascara was yet another total miss.  </li>
      <li>This mascara clearly says waterproof on the package and on the mascara itself.  </li>
      <li>As far as the lash growth part, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any change in my lashes after about 6 weeks of use.</li>
      <li>As far a volume and plumping....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just regular mascara and doesn&#x27;t really plump eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I would just throw it away and switch back to CoverGirl Lash Blast or Clinique High Impact, both of which I recommend highly, but I am on a tight budget, so dumping it isn&#x27;t really an option.</li>
      <li>Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this mascara again, it takes a little too much time to put on, between manipulating the enormous brush and removing clumps, and there are other mascaras that give me just as much length and volume without all the work.</li>
      <li>It takes countless coats to add any type of length or volume, and when it finally does, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and so smudged, it isn&#x27;t even worth it.</li>
      <li>This mascara has both good and bad qualities.</li>

<li> Horrible!</li>
<li> This newer, plumping version is terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Eye lash loss big time!!!! Do not use. mascara also absorbs into the blood stream, be careful what you use on your eyes! This also dries out your skin underneath your eyes!</li>
    <li> I love Revlon&#x27;s regular Grow Luscious formula. This newer, plumping version is terrible. I kept noticing my eyelashes were falling out!!! At first I though I was crazy but when I switched to a different mascara all my lashes stood intact. When I started using this again I would notice eyelashes on my face. Not what I need when my lashes are already sparse. This went right in the trash.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate this mascara. I have the waterproof variety, and it has been an absolute waste of money and has caused a great deal of frustration. It smudges like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I have to wear dark eye shadow every single day to hide the ongoing smudging. It takes countless coats to add any type of length or volume, and when it finally does, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and so smudged, it isn&#x27;t even worth it. I would just throw it away and switch back to CoverGirl Lash Blast or Clinique High Impact, both of which I recommend highly, but I am on a tight budget, so dumping it isn&#x27;t really an option. The wand is huge and ungainly, meaning you&#x27;ll splotch all over the place. I hope they pull this one off the market.</li>
    <li> Nothing really amazing about this product. It&#x27;s just regular mascara and doesn&#x27;t really plump eyelashes. Could have easily bought a cheaper bottle that has the same results.</li>
    <li> This mascara has both good and bad qualities. First of all the brush is HUGE. It&#x27;s twice the size of even Covergirl Lash Blast, which I used to think had a big brush until I tried this one. It does add good volume and length, it&#x27;s just hard to get it on without clumping lashes together,you really have to keep working the brush through to get it spread out evenly. Once you do get it on it stays on well, no flaking or smudging, so that&#x27;s a plus. As far as the lash growth part, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any change in my lashes after about 6 weeks of use. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this mascara again, it takes a little too much time to put on, between manipulating the enormous brush and removing clumps, and there are other mascaras that give me just as much length and volume without all the work.</li>
    <li> One of my must haves in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a couple of weeks now.  It falls pretty much in the middle of the pack, in terms of mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s not bad for a drugstore mascara product, but it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color, which is a nice black.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t run, but stays in place all day (I don&#x27;t try doing things like working out while I wear it, though).  It&#x27;s definitely waterproof; however, it is also very hard for me to remove at the end of the day.  I will think I&#x27;ve gotten it all off and then I&#x27;ll rub an eye later and it will come away with black stuff on it.  And the applicator that comes with it is easy to use -- I don&#x27;t end up with mascara on my eyelids as I do with some other applicators (I&#x27;m thinking of one from e.l.f. in particular).  I haven&#x27;t seen any clumps yet, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m not so thrilled about is that this seems to take awhile to dry, so if I blink after I apply it to my top lashes, some of it will end up on my bottom lashes, as well.  Also, the way it seems to make my lashes bigger (more voluminous, plumped, or whatever) is by making them stick together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to finish the tube I&#x27;m on.  It&#x27;s not a terrible product, by any means.  But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite the right one for me.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, didnt grow my lashes any longer, and was disappointed . Was black colored but it just didnt work the way they advertised it</li>
    <li> I love ordering ny mascara from amazon! It hasn&#x27;t failed me once after ordering this item for a very long time now! i&#x27;m one happy chick when i see it in my mailbox :)</li>
    <li> THIS MASCARA DOES MAKE YOUR LASHES LOOK LONGER, BOUGHT ABOUT 8 OF THEM, I EVEN HAVE MY DAUGHTER ON THIS MASCARA,</li>
    <li> The formula is nice, and stays on without flaking.  But the brush/wand is too big, and does not separate the lashes.</li>
    <li> My number one criteria when buying mascara is it must be waterproof.  This mascara clearly says waterproof on the package and on the mascara itself.  It is anything but waterproof.  After a workout, I look like a raccoon and even just sitting at my desk all day at work, it smears both under my eyes and on my upper lids.  Horrible!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this mascara actually makes your eyelashed grow, but it definitely makes them look super looooooooonnnnggggg when you&#x27;re wearing it! I used to use the rubber brush mascara, but I wanted a change so I bought this. It has the standard kind of bristly brush, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with clumping with this mascara. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I like it.  I&#x27;ve used this mascara for a few months, and now that the tube is getting old, I&#x27;ll actually buy another.  The main reason is because this is not a clumpy mascara and it holds up without giving me raccoon eyes and black flakes that other mascaras do.  I admit, at first I thought this mascara was yet another total miss.  I then learned to work with it since I was already stuck with the new tube!  What worked for me was applying this mascara with a quick, light hand.  One eye, then the other eye, then returning back to do a second coat if desired.  I have used a mascara wand with this, and it makes my lashes look great.  As far a volume and plumping....errr....I don&#x27;t really see any volume or plumping, and cannot say there is any growth as a result.  I will say that based on the ingredients of phyto-peptides (hydrolyzed wheat protein) and panthenol (B5 vitamin), lashes are supposed to be stronger.  If you have brittle lashes, this product may help.  I don&#x27;t have any difficulty removing this mascara (I used either Olay facial cloths or Purpose to wash my face).  Overall, i&#x27;m keeping this because of it&#x27;s value and performance.  I&#x27;m not ready to cross over into fake lashes or extensions or department store brands for $25.  Until I get ready to try something else, I&#x27;m sticking with this for now.</li>
    <li> Just received this and tried it. Seems to be worth the buy!</li>
    <li> My Revlon Grow Luscious Plunping Mascara,Blackest Black is amazing it is definatley the best Mascara i have purchased in years and i also purchased the Revlon Powder Blush,Berry Rich and am extremely satisfied with this product as well, shipping was on time so i have no issues with with delivery at all so i give Amazon 2 Thumbs up and a big thank you. Alison Mc</li>
    <li> I love it...it makes my eyelashes so long!</li>
    <li> I think I got a good deal, its huge for the price I paid, It came in a huger box also, lol, but it puts on nicely.</li>
    <li> This mascara really makes my eyelashes seem long and full. I will ONLY be ordering and using this mascara from now on. Most mascaras are just lengthening or just thickening. This one does it all</li>
