      <li>Really fine hair may not be able to be grabbed though.</li>
      <li>When you squeeze them they just don&#x27;t feel as sturdy, so it&#x27;s harder to get just that perfect hair you want.</li>

      <li>Cannot grasp fine hairs at all.</li>
      <li>Thank you to amazon for getting this out to me so quick!</li>
      <li>Cheap x2</li>
      <li>Cheap, but does not work that well for pulling out ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>Worth it if you&#x27;re not terribly picky with your tweezers.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>We are picky, picky, picky about our tweezers and these ones just didn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>

      <li>Good enough for now, but I would not purchase again.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how nice these are for the price.</li>
      <li>But they&#x27;re not bad for being so inexpensive.</li>
      <li>They are a nice hefty metal that feels solid and are easy to hold.</li>
      <li>Spend a little more and get a good tweezer...</li>
      <li>My new all-time favorite Maybelline product.</li>
      <li>Once you have used a well made tweezer,you realize how much effort it takes to use the cheap ones.  </li>
      <li>I like my old pair much better.</li>
      <li>surprisingly nice for such an inexpensive item.  </li>
      <li>So when I was in my twenties I started plucking the wild ones as they came in and continued the process through the years often borrowing my wife&#x27;s tweezers which she wasn&#x27;t too pleased with</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These tweezer have been perfectly engineered. These tweezers will last until I accidently misplace them. I bought several. One for where I keep tweezer, one for travel, and one pair to replace the first pair when I misplace them.</li>
    <li> They are a tweezers and grab things well, what more to say</li>
    <li> Really solid pair of tweezers with a nice wide end.</li>
    <li> they do what they are supposed to do</li>
    <li> These work fine, but I expected them to have a thinner tip, which would make it easier to grip fine hairs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s in Good quality. It&#x27;s made in China, but it&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> These tweezers do grab most hair with ease. Really fine hair may not be able to be grabbed though. These are great for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> On the 1st use I was impressed by the 5th use it was as if it became dull. I guess for the price it&#x27;s ok.but to be honest I will be searching for its replacement.</li>
    <li> Needs a bit more slant but easy to hold and wide enough to make up for lack of slant.</li>
    <li> Good quality build. Jaws are nice and even.</li>
    <li> Good quality, a little stiff though, but they get the job done.</li>
    <li> it was exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is decent, but it does not have the precision grip of more expensive versions. It may be better for pulling girly hair, but plucking beard and mustache hairs that grow in at bad angles requires a better product.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive but a great buy.  Get&#x27;s the job done, and comes with a little mini elastic to keep them closed while in storage.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I bought two of these and neither grip my facial hairs. Completely worthless.</li>
    <li> These are exactly like shown. Great quality. Awesome price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find the perfect tweezers for eyebrows.  Was trying to replace an old pair the I loved, but there aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.  Clunky and hard to close.  I&#x27;m trying to adjust, but it&#x27;s an uphill battle.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by these tweezers.  It is inexpensive and was surprisingly easy to use and grips securely.  This makes removal of unwanted hair and ingrown hair follicles easy and reliable.</li>
    <li> These are tweezers. They tweeze.</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace a Revlon pair that snapped in half after 5 months of light use.  These tweezers are terrible.  Same experience as the first reviewer; they just refuse a grab a hair follicle... I thought that that was the intended purpose!?!?!  Sadly I threw out the receipt before I had tried them.  I haven&#x27;t had any positive experiences with tweezers made in China I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Tips didn&#x27;t clamp down solid.</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose which is plucking eyebrows, so far I&#x27;ve got no complaints, and its a good product. Overall, I find no defects or dislikes therefore, I really like this product and recommend.</li>
    <li> I used these a few times, but they don&#x27;t really work anymore.  It looks like they are off track and it won&#x27;t latch on any hair.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Not much to write about here, great product, does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> one had slippery tip, the other was ok</li>
    <li> Perfect, compact, and have a nice pointed end which makes small hair removal really easy.  SPEND THE MONEY AND DON&#x27;T GET REALLY CHEAP ONES!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t grab hairs very well</li>
    <li> I keep mine in the medicine cabinet of the bathroom and they show small rust spots sometimes because of the way the metal is. Good tweezers though. Nice even cotact surface.</li>
    <li> I prefer this type of tweezer with the slant cut over other types.  These were purchased for first aid kits and they have the right level of spring tension for that use.</li>
    <li> Cheap, but does not work that well for pulling out ingrown hairs. I thought a name brand would be a safe buy.  It was only a couple bucks, so it was worth a try.</li>
    <li> Excellent precision tools! I&#x27;ve never had a pair of tweezers that were this good! My new all-time favorite Maybelline product.</li>
    <li> Is a excellent product!!! Beatifull!</li>
    <li> Not good. Cannot grasp fine hairs at all.</li>
    <li> Shipping was superb, Very high quality product. Best Tweezer I have purchased in a long time. Usually you get them and they have gaps in between the tip  when you close them. This one was perfect! Lightweight and very durable stainless steel</li>
    <li> Cheap tweezers and the tips do not line up, making the tweezers very difficult to use.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are terrible. They do not grip well, and when they do manage to grasp a hair, they break it rather than pull it out. I threw these tweezers away and bought new ones within a week of my purchase.</li>
    <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
    <li> um these are not good thats all</li>
    <li> worked well, felt like great quality!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are OK. I bought them to replace a pair that had gotten lost. I like my old pair much better. These do work, but I have worked with tweezers that pulled hair easier.</li>
    <li> Worst tweezer I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  Normally I buy Tweezerman brand but they are very expensive so I decided to give a different brand a try.  Big mistake.  This tweezer doesn&#x27;t grab anything- its crazy!  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> perfect! does it job and durable.!! great for splinters too!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a really sharp set of tweezers. These do the job and they are better than the ones I had before, but I think there are sharper ones out there.</li>
    <li> Do what tweezers are supposed to do. Works as well as any good quality tweezer would.</li>
    <li> does the job just as i would expect.  what else is there to say about simple tweezers</li>
    <li> you want shorter eyebrows?&lt;br /&gt;Get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you want to remove said eyebrow?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.</li>
    <li> Just what I was hoping for.  Sturdy and will grab a hair!</li>
    <li> For fine hair tweezing this just didn&#x27;t cut it. The ends don&#x27;t come together enough to get thoe super-fine hairs that I have. My husband now uses these for miscellaneous needs.</li>
    <li> tweezer does not close tightly to grab on to hair. bought two because they were cheap and I got two ctheap non functional tweezers.</li>
    <li> Not the best tweezers, I feel like they&#x27;re almost too flat, and hardly provide enough leverage. Good enough for now, but I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> The tweezers are sturdy and usable for all intended purposes. I also like the small plastic cap provided for use during storage of the tweezer.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how nice these are for the price. And I&#x27;m pretty picky about tweezers.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> They are not a perfect pair of tweezers, but I can&#x27;t complain since they&#x27;re so inexpensive</li>
    <li> I did not know what to expect from tweezers that only cost a penny. These tweezers would not grasp a single hair to pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was part of my whole order and didn&#x27;t realize I would have to pay S&amp;H.My mistake. These tweezers are going into the trash.</li>
    <li> Works okay. Does not get all the hairs.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Not very precise. When you squeeze them they just don&#x27;t feel as sturdy, so it&#x27;s harder to get just that perfect hair you want. But they&#x27;re not bad for being so inexpensive. Worth it if you&#x27;re not terribly picky with your tweezers.</li>
    <li> I needed a good pair of tweezers to grab those really fine hairs in my eyebrows.  The sharp edge of the tweezers come together fully, and easily, and grips the hair with no issue.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> Smaller than the picture, much smaller</li>
    <li> Did not like these at all!</li>
    <li> well, they must be good since my granddaughter absconded with them immediately and did not return them!!!!!!!!  will have to buy another.  the blades line up well so the grasping and holding of whatever you use them for is firm</li>
    <li> These are probably the easiest tweezers that I have ever used. I would definitely recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> Tweezers that don&#x27;t actually tweeze your hairs. :(</li>
    <li> Love it!! Thanks so much :)</li>
    <li> There was nothing wrong with these except that it was difficult to tweese with them. I don&#x27;t know if it was the fine point or the slant. I don&#x27;t use them. Price made sense after I got them though.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these tweezers. I use them daily, more in a work environment that for any type of hygiene related tasks, although I am sure they would work well for that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not it has been difficult to find tweezers that were wide at the end, while still maintaining a somewhat flat profile. Great addition to anyone working with electronics and/or small parts.</li>
    <li> I bought these as precision tweezers to remove ticks. Last spring had one of the most outrageous overabundances of ticks that I&#x27;d ever seen, and I was often picking up 3-4 of them a week just walking through the yard, or weeding the garden. The tweezers that I had had were slippery and I couldn&#x27;t get a good hold on the ticks, just making them mad and digging in even more. These tweezers raised my tick removal game to unprecedented levels. They were also precise enough to be able to get a good hold on the mouthparts that occasionally got stuck inside my skin if I wasn&#x27;t fast enough with pulling them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More recently I&#x27;ve also had success with removing wood and metal splinters, picking up tiny screws off the ground, pulling rogue nose hairs, and crushing the life out of fleas. Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> These work really well.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It pulls the hairs out it very easily from my chin.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I lost my tweezers &amp; wanted a cheap pair until I could find them. But now I&#x27;m not worried, because this pair is awesome! Especially for the price!</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re tweezers, not much to say</li>
    <li> Cheap x2 (in price and in quality). They&#x27;re good as a backup tweezer but they don&#x27;t grip very well.</li>
    <li> ok tweezers. NOt great but I bought them for a first aid kit</li>
    <li> surprisingly nice for such an inexpensive item.  it plucks well and my unibrow is gone</li>
    <li> Tips not very sharp/accurate/well-machined.  Wouldn&#x27;t even want to throw them in a travel bag.</li>
    <li> Once you have used a well made tweezer,you realize how much effort it takes to use the cheap ones.  These are lined up so you get what you are pinching at.</li>
    <li> These tweezers do not work at grabbing hairs. They are pretty much functionless as a consequence. I recommend against purchasing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 13 year old daughter . She&#x27;s loves it. The sound is great ! The light show is awesome .</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, wish it was a little more sharp but it does the job. Best price is on Amazon, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Good for Brow plucking..... met my purpose!!!</li>
    <li> Good tweezers for the price. The slant is okay but sometimes hard to work with.</li>
    <li> Nicely put together, clean finishes, works as stated.</li>
    <li> I believe the quality of this tweezers has improved over the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;The last one I purchased was so useless at grabbing hair that it was given a different task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A task so lowly yet rather important...it was used to dig hair out of the shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;After getting to gunky and rusty for even that use, I ordered a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just on a whim, I first tried it out on a few stray facial hairs. To my surprize, it was plucking them out quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The key is to have a scrupulously clean face, including brows. No lotion, cream, or moisturizing cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, if it only works for a few months (I&#x27;ll update) that&#x27;s fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;After all, I still need one for the drain, so after its facial use is done, back to the lowly tasks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used eyebrow tweezers before, so I&#x27;m not exactly sure what to write about, but I just want to say I&#x27;m happy with it.  My normally hairy eyebrows are now neat and much nicer, and that&#x27;s mostly all I want out of eyebrow tweezers, and this does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> These do not work well. They simply cause hairs to break and do not grip well at all. Not recommended!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I will be recommending this amazing product to all of my close friends and family. If anyone has any questions for me feel free to ask!

    <li> This is a great tweezer. They work perfectly with a great grip, and its a low price. This is my second time buying them - I lost the first one.</li>
    <li> It feels really good plucking my armpit hairs using this tweezers. It pulls very easily. It&#x27;s very well-made and yet inexpensive. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Poor at pulling hair.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Because I am always misplacing tweezers I thought I would try it.  It suited my purpose. When I lose it I will get another.</li>
    <li> These are just a good pair of tweezers. Although there is nothing fancy about them, they get the job done.</li>
    <li> I like these tweezers for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I wanted something more sturdy</li>
    <li> Bought this product as an add-on with some of my other recent purchases which was great because of the low cost of the individual price, this tweezer with [[ASIN:B00JU8KXAK 70 Pairs in 7 Different Styles of False Eyelashes + Free Clipper]].  I have had some other slant tweezers that I bought at the local store and they were just cheaply made.  They rusted and they didn&#x27;t grab with precision. That makes me nervous using on my face.  But this is such an OK made product - very solid and sturdy - that I am able to get it right where I want it even with my not so steady hands.  Overall I just like value - it is very fairly priced, yet still very well made.</li>
    <li> We are picky, picky, picky about our tweezers and these ones just didn&#x27;t fit the bill. They do not grip fine hairs well enough.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are AWESOME, they are sharp but not too sharp, they are a great angle for my pesky hairs and they keep my eyebrows and random chin witch hair in check. If for some reason they go missing I will buy another pair.</li>
    <li> These are excellent for the purpose that I use them for which I&#x27;m not embarrassed to say is the removal of unruly &amp;#34;Old Man&amp;#34; eyebrow hair. When I was younger I noticed that the older men in my family, my father and grandfather had WOLFMAN like bushy eyebrows. I thought it made them look twice their age. So when I was in my twenties I started plucking the wild ones as they came in and continued the process through the years often borrowing my wife&#x27;s tweezers which she wasn&#x27;t too pleased with but she liked the results. Now my wife has passed but the ladies are always telling me I look ten or fifteen years younger than I am. I guess it was worth the effort. So fellows remember the hair dye commercial may say &amp;#34;Mr. Gray gets no play&amp;#34;, but Grandpa &amp;#34;Bush Brows&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t score much either.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the best ever. They are a nice hefty metal that feels solid and are easy to hold. The best thing is that they grab and hold even the shortest hair.  The flat surface of the tip gives you a little bit more gripping surface than some tweezers. I highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, ragged edges. Got what I paid for! It gets the hairs but scratches and cuts you up. Spend a little more and get a good tweezer...I&#x27;m going to.</li>
    <li> If I could give negative stars I would! These won&#x27;t pull out hairs at all. Definitely don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great! Loving this tool for plucking my eyebrows and applying falsies 😊</li>
    <li> Perfect for the people who can actually tweeze! :)</li>
