      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, and am really happy with it.</li>
      <li>If I need to get up and go, but dont have time to wash my hair, I can literally comb out the gel, and my hair will still feel great, if not healthier.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Not sticky or cloggy and it defines your hair style great.</li>
      <li>Good price.  </li>
      <li>This is good quality styling gel and while hold your hair without &amp;#34;gumming it</li>
      <li>Holds good.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff for your hair or my hair</li>
      <li>Great idea to tape the top of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Spreads easily and holds very nicely.</li>
      <li>Not so greasy but sticks nice with shiny finish.</li>
      <li>You do not need to use very much of it to be effective.</li>
      <li>My naturally curly hair is defined, I have perfect spiral curls</li>
      <li>I climbed that learning curve with Dep Gel, I feel like when I look in the mirror in the morning, I&#x27;m more pleased than not.&lt;br /&gt;(Hair-wise, that is.</li>
      <li>I was in a panic and started searching on line until I ordered 12 ...yest 12 and was ok for over a year.</li>
      <li>, it defines really well and makes my hair look great, I get tons of compliments on my spiral curls and how neat my hair looks.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this gel for many years ...</li>
      <li>It has a strong hold</li>
      <li>Quick Ship!  </li>
      <li>I have fine limp hair, this gel works perfect for my bangs.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find it on line because I could not find it in my local stores.</li>
      <li>This gel is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It is strange that what seems to be a very popular product can no longer be purchased in a store.</li>
      <li>If your looking to be able to comb your hair back or style it, this is good stuff and it will stand up against reasonable wind.  </li>
      <li>The stuff is pretty easy to work with (unless you dilly-dally and let it prematurely dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>The bottle works much better than a tube; the cap has a flat top</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly and was packaged very well.  </li>
      <li>I have a curly short hair and my hair gets really frizzy and bushy if I don&#x27;t put any kind of product in it.  </li>
      <li>Water not so much.  </li>
      <li>I needed to try something that would hold really well and wouldn&#x27;t flake, this is the gel that works for me.  </li>
      <li>Reccomend using this product while your hair is still wet or damp :)</li>
      <li>(my hair is very thick and stubborn), and it does not flake like many other hair gels that I have tried, MANY OTHERS!</li>
      <li>Works great on curly hair and does not leave any residue behind to bug you!</li>
      <li>Have used this product for a few years and love how it holds my hair style.</li>
      <li>and I have been getting compliments left and right.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
      <li>it dries crisp (if you use a lot) and keeps the hair flat even through a twelve-hour day of lifting furniture,</li>
      <li>I was VERY happily surprised by this gel&#x27;s performance.</li>
      <li>I bike a considerable amount and it holds.  </li>
      <li>Or, perhaps a healthy does of self-confidence and a ridiculously inflated self-image.</li>
      <li>It will make your hair very stiff and give you kind of a wet look, but it doesn&#x27;t flake so that helps a lot.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In reality, the Dep Sport Endurance Gel (Intense Hold (!), Level 12 (!)) probably contributes a lot, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried high end products to try to maintain my curls and to make them look half decent.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t compare to the high priced gels in salons and bring it with me to the hairdresser too so that I can dry it with this gel....</li>

    <li> This is good quality styling gel and while hold your hair without &amp;#34;gumming it up&amp;#34;.  If your looking to be able to comb your hair back or style it, this is good stuff and it will stand up against reasonable wind.  I bike a considerable amount and it holds.  Water not so much.  If your looking for waterproof hair gel, I&#x27;d suggest superglue.</li>
    <li> Spreads easily and holds very nicely. The bottle works much better than a tube; the cap has a flat top so I store it in top-side down.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for many years ...only to find out that in the last year or two they discontinued this product in Canada.....I am assuming this as no longer do I find it on the shelf anwhere.  I was in a panic and started searching on line until I ordered 12 ...yest 12 and was ok for over a year. I have long natural spiral curls and this gel is the only gel that doesn&#x27;t weight it down...it doesn&#x27;t compare to the high priced gels in salons and bring it with me to the hairdresser too so that I can dry it with this gel....It holds all day and can go a few days still having that wet natural soft look without having to rewash every day...it virtually is the best out there!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and was packaged very well.  Great idea to tape the top of the bottle. Have used this product for a few years and love how it holds my hair style.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff for your hair or my hair lol. Been using this for long time. Not so greasy but sticks nice with shiny finish.</li>
    <li> This gel is fantastic. I recently stopped flat iroining my curly hair because of heat damage. I have tried high end products to try to maintain my curls and to make them look half decent. Nothing worked, infact I was going to continue flat ironing my hair. That&#x27;s until I was in Walmart and saw the .99 bin with trial products in there. One being this Dep sports gel. I said what the heck, for a dollar if I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll toss it. Let me tell you, I was VERY happily surprised by this gel&#x27;s performance. This stuff rocks. My naturally curly hair is defined, I have perfect spiral curls and I have been getting compliments left and right. Infact I had someone say to me why would you straighten your hair with curls like that? Try this, I was a litle put off because it is geared for men, but this stuff holds and defines perfectly. Now all I have to do is find a big bottle of this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have fine limp hair, this gel works perfect for my bangs.  Couldn&#x27;t live without it.  I was so happy to find it on line because I could not find it in my local stores.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Quick Ship!  Great gel!</li>
    <li> I have a curly short hair and my hair gets really frizzy and bushy if I don&#x27;t put any kind of product in it.  I needed to try something that would hold really well and wouldn&#x27;t flake, this is the gel that works for me.  I wear it everyday and I haven&#x27;t had any problem, it defines really well and makes my hair look great, I get tons of compliments on my spiral curls and how neat my hair looks.  It will make your hair very stiff and give you kind of a wet look, but it doesn&#x27;t flake so that helps a lot.  I would recommend this gel to anyone male or female.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure just what to say about a hair gel except this one works. You do not need to use very much of it to be effective.</li>
    <li> I think genetics has a lot to do with that subject line. Or, perhaps a healthy does of self-confidence and a ridiculously inflated self-image. Who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, the Dep Sport Endurance Gel (Intense Hold (!), Level 12 (!)) probably contributes a lot, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, and am really happy with it. It keeps my hair styled all day long. I don&#x27;t have to mess with my hair in the middle of the day. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all hair products, you need to get used to it, you need to develop a feel for how to style your hair. It&#x27;s not that hard. The stuff is pretty easy to work with (unless you dilly-dally and let it prematurely dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I climbed that learning curve with Dep Gel, I feel like when I look in the mirror in the morning, I&#x27;m more pleased than not.&lt;br /&gt;(Hair-wise, that is. My double-chin could use some work, but that&#x27;s not Dep&#x27;s department.)</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!!!  Same as I used years ago. Works great on curly hair and does not leave any residue behind to bug you!</li>
    <li> Got this gel while on my tour. It provides hold and keeps my fizz in check while not tearing up my hair. If I need to get up and go, but dont have time to wash my hair, I can literally comb out the gel, and my hair will still feel great, if not healthier. Reccomend using this product while your hair is still wet or damp :)</li>
    <li> Yup, a little dab will do ya!  It is strange that what seems to be a very popular product can no longer be purchased in a store.</li>
    <li> I love this product! For me, it&#x27;s the best hair gel on the market. It has a strong hold (my hair is very thick and stubborn), and it does not flake like many other hair gels that I have tried, MANY OTHERS! The price on Amazon was unbeatable. I will never buy it at CVS again!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair crispy. I don&#x27;t like crispy hair. My hair type is very thick, so I thought this stuff my help control my hair. It does a little, but still doesn&#x27;t satisfy me. Also I have noticed that if I apply another treatment to my hair, flakes start forming and falling out when I simply touch my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product because when you are growing your hair out from a crewcut to long-hair-combed-straight-back there is an intermediate stage where the hair on top of your head sticks straight up and looks stupid...this product solves that problem ...a brilliantine/pomade would also solve that problem...this goes on faster in the morning than such hair grease does...it dries crisp (if you use a lot) and keeps the hair flat even through a twelve-hour day of lifting furniture, no joke</li>
    <li> I used this  years ago and  back to it.  Holds good.</li>
    <li> Excellent gel.  Not sticky or cloggy and it defines your hair style great.</li>
</ol>
