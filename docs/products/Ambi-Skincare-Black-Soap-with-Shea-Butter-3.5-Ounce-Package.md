      <li>Great buy.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for 4 days now, and I&#x27;m really happy ..</li>
      <li>Great Seller recommended 100%.</li>
      <li>the product is great.</li>
      <li>Yet, once I received the soap and saw how many additives and that it was also scented, I knew that despite the wonderful pricing, this was not the soap that I had hoped to receive.  </li>
      <li>the smell is pleasant ..</li>
      <li>My roommate loved it (he doesn&#x27;t have skin issues).</li>
      <li>The soap came in a timely manner and I loved it.</li>
      <li>It has a good fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff an loved the price</li>
      <li>In one week using Ambi, I&#x27;ve had three zits, the kind</li>
      <li>it refreshes your skin and most of all the stress can and gets all the dirt and grime off of your skin it is a great product and tone just can&#x27;t without you have to do anything I recommend using it twice a day it really works!!</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t buy any more</li>
      <li>:) I&#x27;m getting away from using foundation because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love ambi soaps.</li>
      <li>I tried it first on my face and seeing the amazing result,I started using it for my body</li>
      <li>Ambi black soap with shea butter did an awesome job on my skin.</li>
      <li>I used it on my body and it was fine.</li>
      <li>she told me how great it worked on her when she was younger</li>
      <li>It has faded pratically all of my old acne scars,has given me a nice healthy glow and almost elimated acne breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I am glad this is working for some of us, but folks, if you love your skin, buy yourself a chunk of the real stuff and see the difference for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel really clean after using it.</li>
      <li>I t feels clean after washing with the soap.</li>
      <li>The soap has a very soft smell and lathers up nicely.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find any thing special about this soap.</li>
      <li>I really love this soap it works really well on my skin</li>
      <li>and I have tried a lot of products that mainly end up giving me more acne instead of clearing it up.</li>
      <li>My advice, if your current regimen works fine LEAVE IT ALONE !!</li>
      <li>Worth the wait.</li>
      <li>First, I will start with the positive, i like how the soap leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
      <li>I tried this and within 3 days it took the redness away from my face, pimples got smaller and just disappeared, skin became smooth, felt clean, not oily, was moisturized, I didn&#x27;t even have to put lotion on my face afterwards.</li>
      <li>I love it, bought it for 1.99 at my local hair store.</li>
      <li>I think they should make the bar more bigger for longer use</li>
      <li>but instead it broke me out in many tiny bumps all over my face!!</li>
      <li>thing is true, it does rinse clear.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Secondly, I admit I have had acne prone skin in the past but with a good regimen, I haven&#x27;t had a pimple in years, if not a decade.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Love black soap..</li>
      <li>Although I dont have this, I do have dry skin esp on my face which is primarily where I use this soap.  </li>
      <li>i would highly recommend it wd 5</li>
      <li>Also having sensitive skin and oily skin in certain areas it caused a couple of cyst bumps to appear.</li>
      <li>I admit I&#x27;m a little biased, because I love shea butter generally, but I thought that Ambi shea butter is really good since I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and most of my dark spots are gone and my face has seriously cleared up a lot.</li>
      <li>you have to use it continously for at least two months to see the amazing result...</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t know if its a new formula or</li>
      <li>I would strongly advise using this if you want a more natural product and less stress of having to use a three step bogus product that does not work at all(proactiv)!!!!!</li>
      <li>Many people were ranting and raving about how well it worked for dry skin especially for people who have skin diseases such as exzema(sp).  </li>
      <li>Its not harsh to my skin and</li>
      <li>My face is really sensitive</li>
      <li>She loves beauty products that are not harsh at all.</li>
      <li>Not only it was fast and convenient shopping</li>
      <li>I recommend it to all my African American brothers and sisters it complements just gave the key to clean</li>
      <li>Got it at Dollar General for 2 $!!</li>
      <li>run out of raw black soap and bought Ambi because it has such good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind my face being dry, because my face is really oil.</li>
      <li>However, I received a package from Dollar General Store.  </li>
      <li>I have no problem with Dollar General.</li>
      <li>It made my skin feel really soft but it left some residue.</li>
      <li>I used the soap the same day and my skin felt soft after using it.</li>
      <li>I will be trying the Raw black soap to see if the benefits increase,but I would also rack up on some more AMBI .</li>
      <li>First of all,the way it hurts you eyes if you are not careful is indication enough that this is no mild</li>

<li> and it is really cleaning my face up of dark spots from previous acne.</li>
<li> Now for the negatives, it does not clear up breakouts &amp; maybe even causes them.</li>
<li> It does clear my acne breakouts that well , but it is getting rid / lightening my dark spots !!</li>
<li> Not really &amp;#34;black soap&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> Just not the results i expected.</li>
<li> Believe me, there is only only one black soap: it is the real raw african black soap from Africa.</li>
<li> I have been using Ambi Black Soap for a month and it has done wonders for my acne prone dry skin.  </li>
<li> I found it worked like any other soap.</li>
<li> soap leaves your skin a bit dry , and leaves a little residue .</li>
<li> i want to try a brand that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin really dry you cant use this soap everyday just a couple times a week</li>
<li> Then I did some research and saw that this isnt true black soap this has artificial colors and chemicals in it.</li>
<li> So I order this soap  because of all the good reviews and let me tell you its horrible!!</li>
<li> I bought this soap after my sister mentioned trying black soap for her eczema .</li>
<li> I am black &amp; panamanian, it made my skin even toned as well.</li>
<li> I purchased Ambi black soap with shea butter from Unplugged.  </li>
<li> It contains a lot of chemicals, including dye which is why it&#x27;s black.</li>
<li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me, I used it once a day for about a week and a half</li>
<li> I have used the raw black soap for about a year and did not get the results I have now.  </li>
<li> Real black soap isnt even completely black</li>
<li> I rather pay $23-$30 for 12bars of real black soap, then $2-$3 a bar for Ambi Black Soap.</li>
<li> Do yourself a favor and order real Black Soap</li>
<li> Dont be fool, I&#x27;ve been using real Black Soap and this Ambi Black Soap is garbage!!</li>
<li> Furthermore, I was lead to believe it would be \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or at least somewhat so.  </li>
<li> It DRIED my skin out!!</li>
<li> The black soap smells awful to me, but it did keep my face somewhat clear</li>
<li> It seemed to make my skin worse.</li>
<li> but it dried my skin out really bad.</li>
<li> All the other industrial crap doesn&#x27;t even come close.&lt;br</li>
<li> I think thats where people go wrong.</li>
<li> but this was a bit disappointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No dryness and or over moisture.  I can&#x27;t get enough of this product and have been using it for years.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love black soap..Got it at Dollar General for 2 $!!</li>
    <li> So I order this soap  because of all the good reviews and let me tell you its horrible!! One bar lasted 5days, mind you I shower twice a day. It DRIED my skin out!! My husband thought it smelled! Dont be fool, I&#x27;ve been using real Black Soap and this Ambi Black Soap is garbage!! Do yourself a favor and order real Black Soap you will notice the different. I will never go back to regular soap!! I rather pay $23-$30 for 12bars of real black soap, then $2-$3 a bar for Ambi Black Soap. Just my 2cents!!</li>
    <li> Item as promised. Fast shipping. Great Seller recommended 100%. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I heard about this soap via Twitter.  Many people were ranting and raving about how well it worked for dry skin especially for people who have skin diseases such as exzema(sp).  Although I dont have this, I do have dry skin esp on my face which is primarily where I use this soap.  The soap has a very soft smell and lathers up nicely.  Its non-irritating to the eyes or skin in sensative areas such as face and under arms and o on.  After only two uses my face is already clearing up and my skin stays glowing all day.  Ive gotten compliments already.  Great buy.  Worth the wait.</li>
    <li> The soap came in a timely manner and I loved it. I used the soap the same day and my skin felt soft after using it.</li>
    <li> I love ambi soaps. Cleans my skin really good! I think they should make the bar more bigger for longer use</li>
    <li> Love this stuff an loved the price</li>
    <li> I tried this and within 3 days it took the redness away from my face, pimples got smaller and just disappeared, skin became smooth, felt clean, not oily, was moisturized, I didn&#x27;t even have to put lotion on my face afterwards. I am black &amp; panamanian, it made my skin even toned as well. try it , I swear you would buy it again</li>
    <li> Now ! I bought this soap after my sister mentioned trying black soap for her eczema . She loves beauty products that are not harsh at all. She loves it .. I tried it because of my acne and blemishes.I have been using it for 4 days now, and I&#x27;m really happy .. It does clear my acne breakouts that well , but it is getting rid / lightening my dark spots !! :) I&#x27;m getting away from using foundation because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this I wanted to try a fade lightening creme.. But I don&#x27;t like moisturizing my body unless I&#x27;m leaving the house .. So I wanted a soap not a lotion or creme&lt;br /&gt;The soap leaves your skin a bit dry , and leaves a little residue . I feel really clean after using it. I also had blemishes on my body , and I&#x27;m seeing it is helping lighten those , and also improve my skin tone all together. I don&#x27;t mind my face being dry, because my face is really oil. Its not harsh to my skin and the smell is pleasant .. I love it, bought it for 1.99 at my local hair store. I will be trying the Raw black soap to see if the benefits increase,but I would also rack up on some more AMBI .</li>
    <li> i want to try a brand that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin really dry you cant use this soap everyday just a couple times a week</li>
    <li> Ambi black soap with shea butter did an awesome job on my skin.I tried it first on my face and seeing the amazing result,I started using it for my body and I got an excellent result...you have to use it continously for at least two months to see the amazing result...i would highly recommend it wd 5 stars!!!!!!555☀️☀️☀️</li>
    <li> Purchased this soap in hopes of evening out my skin tone but instead it broke me out in many tiny bumps all over my face!! My advice, if your current regimen works fine LEAVE IT ALONE !! Product didn&#x27;t work for me, I used it once a day for about a week and a half and it burned my face however, this was MY experience.</li>
    <li> I purchased Ambi black soap with shea butter from Unplugged.  However, I received a package from Dollar General Store.  I have no problem with Dollar General. I shop there often.  However, I do have a problem in that based on the description I read, I was lead to believe that this soap would be unscented.  Furthermore, I was lead to believe it would be \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or at least somewhat so.  Yet, once I received the soap and saw how many additives and that it was also scented, I knew that despite the wonderful pricing, this was not the soap that I had hoped to receive.  I doubt I will be purchasing from Unplugged again.</li>
    <li> AMB Iis great! I recommend it to all my African American brothers and sisters it complements just gave the key to clean it refreshes your skin and most of all the stress can and gets all the dirt and grime off of your skin it is a great product and tone just can&#x27;t without you have to do anything I recommend using it twice a day it really works!!</li>
    <li> I like the way it  makes my face feel. I t feels clean after washing with the soap. It has a good fragrance.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find any thing special about this soap. I found it worked like any other soap. Wouldn&#x27;t buy any more</li>
    <li> I really love this soap it works really well on my skin and I have tried a lot of products that mainly end up giving me more acne instead of clearing it up. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and my skin has a wonderful glow to it and it is really cleaning my face up of dark spots from previous acne. I would strongly advise using this if you want a more natural product and less stress of having to use a three step bogus product that does not work at all(proactiv)!!!!! #Love This!!!</li>
    <li> I started off with the &amp;#34;Ambi complexion cleansing bar&amp;#34; and switched to this... The black soap smells awful to me, but it did keep my face somewhat clear but it dried my skin out really bad. Also having sensitive skin and oily skin in certain areas it caused a couple of cyst bumps to appear.</li>
    <li> Not really &amp;#34;black soap&amp;#34;. It contains a lot of chemicals, including dye which is why it&#x27;s black. My face is really sensitive so it made me breakout after using it a couple of times. I used it on my body and it was fine. It made my skin feel really soft but it left some residue. My roommate loved it (he doesn&#x27;t have skin issues). I purchased two but didn&#x27;t use the second (I gave them both to him). Too expensive and too many chemicals. I would never purchase again.</li>
    <li> Believe me, there is only only one black soap: it is the real raw african black soap from Africa. All the other industrial crap doesn&#x27;t even come close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run out of raw black soap and bought Ambi because it has such good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I used it close to a week. First of all,the way it hurts you eyes if you are not careful is indication enough that this is no mild stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I admit I have had acne prone skin in the past but with a good regimen, I haven&#x27;t had a pimple in years, if not a decade. In one week using Ambi, I&#x27;ve had three zits, the kind you pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is true, it does rinse clear. I am glad this is working for some of us, but folks, if you love your skin, buy yourself a chunk of the real stuff and see the difference for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ambi? I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> Not only it was fast and convenient shopping the product is great. Best skin care product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ambi Black Soap for a month and it has done wonders for my acne prone dry skin.  It has faded pratically all of my old acne scars,has given me a nice healthy glow and almost elimated acne breakouts.  I have used the raw black soap for about a year and did not get the results I have now.  Keep up the good work AMBI!</li>
    <li> First, I will start with the positive, i like how the soap leaves my skin feeling clean. Now for the negatives, it does not clear up breakouts &amp; maybe even causes them. I was hoping the soap would help with dark spots but so far no results &amp; i have used the soap regularly for about a month now. Just not the results i expected.</li>

    <li> I bought this soap because my mother raved about it. she told me how great it worked on her when she was younger so I gave it a try but I don&#x27;t know if its a new formula or what but this was a bit disappointing. It seemed to make my skin worse. Then I did some research and saw that this isnt true black soap this has artificial colors and chemicals in it. Real black soap isnt even completely black I think thats where people go wrong. But it definately didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
