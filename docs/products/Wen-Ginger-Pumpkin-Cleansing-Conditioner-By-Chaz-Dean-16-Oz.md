<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wen made my hair dull &amp; waxy after repeated use.  I do not heat style my hair.  I don&#x27;t know if that makes the difference, but I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
    <li> Wen is great stuff.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this one, &amp; I was surprised by the smell. It&#x27;s not your regular pumpkin spice smell - the ginger gives it more of an antiseptic/medicinal odor (a lot like the pink ginger you get with your sushi).  Also, the ginger makes your scalp tingle, so if you don&#x27;t like this feeling, this Wen is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have, which I have addressed on ALL my Wen reviews, is the amount of pumps you are directed to use in the instructions.  If you follow the directions exactly, you will run out of this product in a week.  I have medium fine, below shoulder-length hair, &amp; I can fully saturate my hair in 6-8 pumps.  A bottle this size last me well longer than a month.</li>
    <li> My favorite cream in the shower.  Great for face, hair and it is so natural without the chemicals that in so many products.  Keep making this.</li>
    <li> I have never been crazy about the way Wen products clean my hair, it may be my thick hair type, but it is dull and doesn&#x27;t feel that clean, unless I use it with another shampoo, which I do. I primarily use the products as an adjunct to my own conditioner and a leave in. I like the scents. I wanted this scent to be strong and spicy, like when I think of ginger, but I can&#x27;t really put my finger on what the scent it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long. I prefer the Fall Apple Spice or Summer Mango over this one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen cleansing conditioners for several years now. My hair was quite damaged from using a flat iron on it every day, so I started to use this product line to help repair my hair. I use the cleansing conditioner, hair mask weekly, and styling creme. I was using it as my only shampoo for a few years, but I found that it didn&#x27;t really clean my hair as well as other shampoos. But it is a great product that (combined with the Wen hair mask) really helped make my hair healthier. So I started using Avalon organic shampoo first, then this, and that combination works fairly well. Wen is a great product line overall.</li>
    <li> I really tried to give this a chance... i lasted 3 weeks and couldn&#x27;t stand feeling like my hair was dirty all the time... yuck</li>
    <li> Love the product, would not use anything else on my hair. Smells great, make sure to rinse completely.&lt;br /&gt;just love.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I will not go back to using shampoo. I have fine hair and I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily actually I don&#x27;t even mess with my hair during the day after I fix it! Love the product!</li>
    <li> I have used wen sweet almond mint for several years now and loved it.  I purchased wen ginger pumpkin recently and found it lacking.  Ginger pumpkinn doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair very well.  I will return to sweet almond mint the next time I purchase Wen.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve Wen shampoo and it works pretty well. Sometimes my hair goes every which way and sometimes it is fine. Why, I don&#x27;t know. When I saw it on your site at a better price I decided to try it again.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to return this sub-par product which did the complete opposite of what they claimed...aka makes your hair nice and greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling to cancel the remaining shipments through their automated answering service we were told our account was canceled and we wouldn&#x27;t be charged or sent anymore product...Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next month we received another shipment and were billed again :0 So we called and cancelled again using their automated answering service. (SPOILER: their automated answer service obviously doesn&#x27;t work because we got billed again!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to stay on until I spoke with a REAL PERSON (I recommend getting a good book to read while you wait.) and I eventually had the pleasure of speaking with \\&quot;Darius\\&quot; who informed me if I returned the product I would get a refund.  I fedex&#x27;d them back their product and mistakenly assumed I was done with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  Next we received a collection letter from the wonderful people over at Wen.  Funny, I assumed canceling THREE times would be enough to have them get the hint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling back again and waiting an hour again to speak to a live individual I was finally informed by a \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; the account would finally be canceled and I would receive my refund. (Never do business with a company that refuses to EMAIL you a confirmation the account is canceled...they would only send it by mail.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know they&#x27;re lying to me like they lied to me the previous three times but I&#x27;m sure at some point the Better Business Bureau will get to the bottom of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story - Useless product, even worse customer service, it&#x27;s basically a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake we did...don&#x27;t order it in the first place!!!</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It reminds me of Fall all year round! And it lives up to the Wen product line. Soft and smooth hair with just one product.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t spend my money so foolishly again on this product</li>
    <li> [after 1 wash] Wen just doesn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. My hair is chemically straightened - which is probably the issue, because there are silicons in those chemicals. Wen doesn&#x27;t cause a &amp;#34;problem,&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s expensive and unfortunately less effective than my sulfate-free shampoo and drugstore conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it worked nicely in my hair. I would purchase this again, most probably in the fall .</li>
    <li> I was curious about this product. Bought one (cheapest I could find, the pumpkin spice?) .  I like the feeling of my hair after I use it.  My hair is smoother and seems having more volume . The price is a little more expensive.  I probably will use it at times .</li>
    <li> Same great product for washing your hair minus the sulfates and bubbles.  My hair smells like Pumpkin Pie when I use it.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Let me first say I love Wen products, have used them exclusively for the past couple of years. Ginger pumpkin smells great and made my hair look good, but I got 2 migraines the first week I used it.   I usually get migraines from food with the sweetener aspartame in it (like in Equal). But I was sure I hadn&#x27;t eaten anything harmful, I&#x27;m very careful about that. I finally thought to check the ingredients on the cleansing conditioner (it was the only new thing I&#x27;d introduced that week) and saw something in it called aspartic acid. Googling it told me that&#x27;s a main ingredient in aspartame. So if you&#x27;re a person who is sensitive to aspartame, DON&#x27;T use this product. It guess it absorbs right through the scalp.  UPDATE: Make sure you read the comments on this post...I&#x27;m not the only one who has had this problem!  Oh, and interestingly, I tried to post this same review on QVC which is where I bought the product, and they refused to post it. I just got an email saying it didn&#x27;t meet their criteria for appropriate product reviews. I guess the only appropriate reviews are the 5 star ones.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, have used Wen for many years now and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel soft and not heavy at all.  It smells good too.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I hoped that after spending the money that this would give me the results I was hoping for. And it did, for about 3-4 washes. Because I have long hair, I have to use about 20-30 pumps and at that rate, the bottle only lasted me about a month. Trying something else.</li>
    <li> I am going on two weeks of using this exclusively, and my hair has never been greasier. My hair is shoulder length, and I&#x27;ve tried 10 pumps, 15 pumps and 20 pumps, all at the same time, breaking the amounts in half, not using it as a leave in conditioner, pretty much everything. It smells nice though. And on the plus side, 15+ pumps at a time will make this bottle go quick.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try Wen but unfortunately was very disappointed. It leaves my hair dull and feeling heavy and oily. I find now I&#x27;m better off with shampoo and a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of WEN for a couple of years now-but started to steer away from it because I was getting bored of the same old scents.  The Fall Ginger Pumpkin is the most amazing smelling shampoo ever!  Not only does it smell great though-it makes my hair feel amazing!  I used it for the second day in a row-just came in to work and everyone could see and smell the difference.  I absolutely love it and am going to buy a couple additional bottles since I hear this is going to be a seasonal item-don&#x27;t think about it-just buy it-you&#x27;ll love it too!!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying there is NOTHING HARMFUL in this conditioner at all. I love WEN, but I dislike the strong medicinal menthol scent that accompanies all of his \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; in the permanent line.    Pumpkin and ginger are my 2 favorite fall scents, so I had to have this.  The scent is divine, equal amounts of pumpkin and ginger, your shower feels like you&#x27;re in a kitchen of freshly baked gingerbread men and pumpkin pie.   As for the performance, I love this formula, and I hope he uses the same formula for all of the seasonal scents. It&#x27;s very moisturizing (as moisturizing as fig), soft beautiful curls with this one. After trying the first bottle, I ordered 3 more.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried Wen. I have wanted to for awhile but to be honest the price kind of kept me from trying it. I initially gave this product a 5 star review a couple of days after I bought it however I have changed it to a two star. My hair feels horrible. I have very dry damaged hair and I thought that this would be the answer. Wrong. I was using One and Only Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner and I am going to Sally&#x27;s beauty to buy more today to get my hair back in the condition it was before I started using Wen. Also, I was excited to try the Pumpkin scent. The only thing I smell is cloves. ?</li>
    <li> Pump bottle never worked - very annoying!  Scent not as good as it should have been (I&#x27;ve bought this before).</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, my hair has never been this manageable. I&#x27;ve never been able to even curl my hair before now, it would just fall flat in minutes, now I can wave it or just leave it alone just air dry and go because it&#x27;s silky smooth! And smells great, love it!</li>
    <li> I am a sucker for Pumpkin anything. So I was ecstatic when my boyfriend bought me this conditioner. It felt great on my hair, while wet in the shower, and smelled divine. However, once I rinsed my hair, the texture felt rough. Was even worse once I towel dried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I got the performance of the Fig conditioner in this Ginger Pumpkin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they get carried away when saying that they are good for all hair types. Perhaps for the purpose of cleansing only. This Ginger Pumpkin is not good for coarse/wavy/ethnic hair. Fig is best for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, using these products as leave in conditioners don&#x27;t work well on my hair either. Makes my hair feel like it&#x27;s coated in a sticky wax. Doesn&#x27;t feel natural at all.</li>
    <li> I have straight to wavy hair (depends on whether or not I blow my hair dry) and this stuff works great. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I don&#x27;t have to pay for two seperate products. I also use it on my six year olds hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all the Wen Cleansing Conditioners over the past few years.  Love them all!  The lavender works best for my thick, dry hair, but this pumpkin is a nice seasonal change.</li>
    <li> As I have said in my other reviews of Wen Hair Care Products, I love &#x27;em! I will always use Wen. My hair is healthy and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my thin, fine, long hair. I no longer have to use conditioner in order to comb out my hair.The clutter in my shower has been removed because this is the only product I need.</li>
    <li> hmm I always wanted to try this one out for a long time. today.... finally I did.... nothing great at all about this shampoo. it was like washing  my hair with a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;my first day hair is always frizzy like I have static all the time. but this controlled that a lot. it felt great for sometime then back to my head feeling all dry ( did I mention I have super dry hair... wintertime is the worst)&lt;br /&gt;overall it did control a lot of my frizz ness and made it behave. but failed at feeling moist and super tamed like they show on the website and qvc. oh btw it dosent control dandruff.</li>
    <li> not as good as they say on t.v.! what a dissapointment! smells good though. my granddaughter even said it&#x27;s just like regular shampoo&lt;br /&gt;only a LOT more expensive! didn&#x27;t make our hair better - as a matter of fact my hair got MORE static! stick to the store brands- Pantene or?</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have purchased several different fragrances of the cleansing conditioner and the Ginger Pumpkin is probably my favorite. I have used it and recommended it for many years. Unlike other conditioning shampoos, it does not weigh your hair down or make it feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Order this product through Amazon and you don&#x27;t have to deal with the auto ship,which to me, is highly annoying and I always ended up with more product than I could ever use. If I had not found it on Amazon I would have stopped buying this product even though I love it. I did not like buying from WEN because of the auto ship.&lt;br /&gt;**On a side note: I do love the shampoo, but you do not need to use as much as they recommend (8 pumps I think). I have long hair and about 4-5 pumps is all I use and my hair looks and smells great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love WEN products! And I love shopping on Amazon as I always get an amazing deal for my money. So, imagine my surprise just now when I came here to order this new product by Chaz added to his line for the fall, a limited time item only to find it $12.00 more than on any other site, plus S&amp;H as well! I don&#x27;t understand this at all, and yes, it is the same size, 16 ounces! I was counting on amazon to have a little better price than all the others, not so much higher, this is $12.00 more than retail! Whats up????[[ASIN:B005KSZKTI WEN Fall Ginger Pumpkin Cleansing Conditioner - 16oz]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in no way someone who spends lots of money on beauty products. In fact, I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;what&#x27;s for under $2.00 on sale&amp;#34; type of shampoo and conditioner person, so the fact I spent the money on this product should be a testament enough.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is extremely thick - I mean, really really - so thick that hairdressers call each other over to see my hair when I get my hair cut. My hair is home colored, dry, and very coarse. Lots of breakage, and lots of hair in the drain after a wash. In other words, my hair was in tough shape. I&#x27;d tried samples of more expensive shampoos, but they didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair that the 99 cent bottle of Suave couldn&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I tried Wen was because of this scene. I&#x27;m a Pumpkin fanatic. I use and eat everything pumpkin, and to find a pumpkin shampoo was just too exciting for me to pass up, so I did an impulse purchase on amazon. I&#x27;ve seen the infomercials, but didn&#x27;t hold my hope I&#x27;d get anything out of it other than a pumpkin scent. O. M. G. First of all, the scent is to DIE for (if you&#x27;re into pumpkin, cinnamon, and autumn type of smells) and it stays with you all day. Yes, I had people smelling my hair. But moreso, I could not believe what it did to my hair. It was - dare I say it? - soft. From the moment I used it, I felt a difference right down to my scalp. When my hair dried, it bounced. It was shining. No hair in the sink. And people commented on it. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginners luck? Nope, each time I use it my hair just gets better. In fact, the new hair growth since beginning this product is more shining and healthy than I&#x27;ve ever seen it. I&#x27;m waiting for the new hair growth to be long enough so I can cut the old hair off, but even the old damaged hair has healed dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product so much that I went onto the Wen website and signed up for auto-delivery. Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t have my pumpkin available, but their Lavender is amazing as well. In fact, Lavendereven feels better on my scalp, almost a &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34;. I love their cucumber aloe as well, but Pumpkin will always be my favorite, and I can only get it here on amazon. I&#x27;ve started using it on my kids as well (aged 3 and 7) because they&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with my hair. And yes, it works on them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution since so many people have commented on feeling &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; after using it - A friend of mine has gluten allergies very bad and she CANNOT use Wen. So, apparently it&#x27;s not gluten free, although it is free of other chemicals used in ordinary shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair. It&#x27;s worth the money. At least, it was for me!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this Cleansing Conditioner.  I have been using WEN for years and get compliments on my hair all the time when I switched to WEN.  My hair is soft, tangle free, shiney, and smells great!  I have been getting my hair double processed for many years and you would never know it by the way my hair looks, so healthy.  I will never use shampoo again, it really does ruin your hair.  If you have not tried WEN I do encourage you to give it a try.  Be sure to follow the directions on how to use WEN, alot of people do not use the recommend amount and do not get great results due to this.  You will find using WEN that you only need to wash your hair around 2 times a week.  All of WEN products are great!</li>
    <li> The first time did ok for the first day....by the second, my hair felt and looked oily....I didn&#x27;t need that as I have oily hair anyway....The second time I used it, it looked oily that day....I have long fine hair...and it seemed to pull it down....and make it flatter....</li>
    <li> Good product....keeps the frizz down even when it is humid out....also works with the brazilian blowout to aid in smooth, sleek hair</li>
    <li> Have used WEN cleansing conditioner for several years.  Yes, it seems expensive, but you don&#x27;t need but a tablespoon or two even for long hair.  It really does clean and keep your hair from feeling stripped of natural oil, yet makes your hair clean and easy to comb or style.</li>
    <li> I like the emphasis on conditioning rather than shampooing. Shampoo strips my hair and by the time I restore its moisture its time to wash again. Its cleans and conditions sufficiently and I can always condition afterwards if I need extra conditioning.</li>
    <li> Because I have been using it for a few years and I get clean results.  It takes some time to get used to it not lathering, but at least you get clean hair.</li>
    <li> I love Wen conditioning cleanser however, I do not like this scent.  I prefer clean smelling scents so I should have known better.</li>
    <li> I liked the mint one better.  My hair is dryer with this scent</li>
    <li> This smells really weird.  Not exactly pumpkin, not exactly cinnamon, more of a clove/tea tree oil smell.  I don&#x27;t like it as well as other scents.</li>
    <li> Purchased this scent as my first ever WEN Haircare purchase.  I absolutely love the scent!  It is not overpowering as I read in one review and I have had many compliments on how good my hair smells!!!  Would recommend this scent and will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> If you like pumpkin pie, you&#x27;ll love this fragrant scent!  Of course, it does a great job and leaves my hair soft &amp; healthy looking and full of body without flyaways, just like the original Wen cleanser.  If you&#x27;re ordering this, you probably are already familiar with the Wen line, so I just wanted to comment on the scent.  It will make you close your eyes and say &amp;#34;Mmmm&amp;#34; every time you use it!</li>
    <li> I love WEN.. Regular shampoos will never touch my hair again!</li>
    <li> I go back and forth with this product because I tend to have to use quite a bit of it too wash my hair.  The conditioner comes in a tiny little container and I tend to need much more for my full long head of hair.</li>
    <li> As far as performance - its a WEN cleanser and works as such - pretty great. However, as far as the smell - I was expecting more. It is very much clove oriented which was great by me and it smells good from the bottle, BUT.... I could barely smell it on my hair. I was expecting a stronger residual scent. Had I been able to get a whiff after my shower I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I tried several different versions of WEN and all of them work well on my fine hair.  This seasonal scent is not my favorite, even though my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> doesnt do what it claims</li>
    <li> Wen did help my scalp which is dry, but mad my hair very greasy. It did not get rid of any friz either.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser from Southern California. I have seen a lot of advertisement for the Wen product. My hair is beached, damaged on the ends. I am seeing some thinning due to this. I have seen some success from the ovation product I seriously won&#x27;t have to use that anymore. No joke, It is true what the ad says about feeling a difference the first time you use Wen. I for real threw out all of my shampoos and conditioners after using it three times. After getting out of the shower my hair dries in like five minutes now with leave in conditioner, this is crazy.</li>
    <li> I really like wen. been using the \\&quot;sweet almond mint\\&quot; and the \\&quot;fig\\&quot; for about two years now but do not like either of those scents at all. While I love the smoothing results of wen, both of those scents are too menthol-y and smell like a vicks cough drop. This new ginger pumpkin feels even creamier and smells wonderful compared to the other two. much lighter on the menthol, slightly heavy on the clove. would&#x27;ve liked more pumpkin but overall I&#x27;m very happy with it. I purchased two bottles unsniffed and am very satisfied. The smell lingers throughout the day after using it. reminds me of autumn and cinnamon sticks. would definitely repurchase as long as it&#x27;s available. wish they would keep it on the line instead of only being offered seasonally.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product just to give it a try, because the infomercials were compelling, but I did not want to sign up for the autoship in case the product was a flop. I was very impressed with the packaging and the smell when opening.  The product itself works very well. My hair is shiny and soft, and I don&#x27;t need to add much or any gel to manage it. (I have short hair anyway) It was good that they point out no lather, because that is true. It is a change from convention after all the years of seeing the lather in shampoo commercials and using &#x27;lathery&#x27; shampoo. Fear not, the product works really well. Hair feels clean and not dried out, and also not greasy or weighed down.  I am very impressed. I also later purchased the standard almond mint version, and that works just as well.  I am recommending to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Love wen but hate this scent..made my hair super greasy didn&#x27;t like the smell either</li>
    <li> I love WEN hair products</li>
    <li> I, like everybody else, have seen the infomercials pretty much every time I have a bout of insomnia. I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of trying Wen for a good long while. I finally ordered just this product rather than any \\&quot;made for TV\\&quot; combination of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of hair. It&#x27;s wavy, dry, prone to flyways, and did I mention I bleach the bejeesus out of it. I use some pretty high dollar hair care products, Kerastase,  and still I&#x27;m not universally happy with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions, in that I used quite a bit of product to \\&quot;cleanse\\&quot; and left it on while I shaved my legs etc.  I just rinsed, didn&#x27;t repeat, and didn&#x27;t put in an extra as a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; because I wanted to see what just \\&quot;clean\\&quot; Wen hair would feel like. I blow-dried without any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels fantastic~ smooth,  with very few flyaways, and it took the straightening iron in a single pass, where normally it takes two to three. I can also feel that my hair is more resilient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going convert to the church of Chaz just yet, but this product certainly does merit a longer trial period.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great smelling product for October.  I don&#x27;t use the pump that came with it.  This is my second bottle.  I&#x27;m still not certain this is the BEST thing for my hair, but I&#x27;m giving it more time.  It does feel better.  I live in Humid Florida, so I&#x27;m waiting for the humidity to go down to get a better picture on my dry frizzy locks.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this transaction. The shipping (or handling)was very slow, just over the max time projected for super saver shipping. There was no note, invoice, or receipt of any kind in the box packed with the product. In the past, I have always used super saver shipping because it is always earlier than stated. This product arrived WITHOUT a pump even though the picture clearly shows one. I tried using a pump from one of my old Wen products (bought directly from Wen)and it does not fit this bottle. I do not know if this is an actual Wen product or a knock off, but it does not work as well and leaves a funny smell in the hair. I will never purchase this product nor buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Let me first say, that I didn&#x27;t order this from Amazon. I caught a special on QVC and I&#x27;ve been secretly wanting to try it for over a year. The smell is devine! I love it! I can say that as far as the promise of bouncy, supple hair is mediocre! It works nicely but I don&#x27;t find it worth the price. It has an amazing tingle affect while you wash your hair, which I love! I&#x27;ve tried it many ways...I&#x27;ve done the rinsing my hair for 3 minutes before, massaged for 3 minutes, let it sit for 3 minutes then rinsed again for 3 minutes and put a tiny bit in for leave in conditioner...which didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. Once it&#x27;s rinsed and towel dried, it&#x27;s a little tangly. And another thing I&#x27;ve noticed with it is with or without leaving it in as a leave in is that it takes a lot longer to blow dry than with ordinary shampoo. It advises to use several pumps for each section...so I&#x27;ve used a lot in the week I&#x27;ve had it. I say if you have a lot of money to purchase this product and have plenty of time to go through the several step process, as well as the time to blow dry your hair--you most likely will not be disappointed. I just don&#x27;t have the time or the money to keep up this regimin. I wish I did. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my hair is soft and smells nice but not enough for me to drop $30 on this stuff once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw-I have thin, color treated, heating iron and blow dryer abused shoulder length hair that gets oily easily and this product did not weigh my hair down or make it feel over moisturized...I thought I should add that!</li>
    <li> I was actually disappointed in Wen!  I think though, it&#x27;s because I have very fine hair and this just weighs it down, makes it look greasy.  I eventually would use a very small amount and use it as a leave in conditioner but I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Smells and works wonderful.</li>
    <li> This scent is still one of my all-time favorite Wen cleansing conditioners.  I recommend it to friends and family.  Grab it while you still can.</li>
    <li> awesome hair products. never have dry hair again by using this product. it always leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Wen, bring it back.  Smells great. Moisturizes. Hair is soooo soft.  I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often (but I want to :)</li>
    <li> I like the Wen products. This one does smell like it is described. I would say more spice smell then pumpkin. It was sealed and came with the pump. Overall, good purchase. However, I prefer the sweet almond fragrance of Wen.</li>
    <li> This is the 5th bottle of WEN I&#x27;ve used and I can honestly say at 38 I finally have the hair I always wanted.  My hair is super fine and thin and with this I can do very little styling and it looks full all day - never thought I&#x27;d say that!  I&#x27;ve mostly used the lavender but this was a nice change.  I&#x27;ll probably go back to lavender after this.</li>
    <li> Easy to use; conditions as it cleans without leaving hair too soft.  Color seems to last a bit longer, also.</li>
    <li> I am forever a Wen girl.  I have used the cleansing conditioner for 2 years and everywhere I go someone tells me that I have beautiful hair.  I will never go back to traditional shampoo.  Love the pumpkin.</li>
    <li> I love the Ginger Pumpkin cleansing conditioner by Chaz Dean.  Not only is it a superior product, it smells great!</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen products for over a year now.  Ginger pumpkin is one of my favorite smells that they make.  It is usually available in the fall.  Wen itself works well.  I have very dry hair because I live in the desert and my hair is also pretty gray.  I color it every month and Wen does hold the color well as advertised.  If your hair is dry or colored, this is a product you should try.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, love this product, smells wonderful. Lasts all day, again another great product of wen.</li>
    <li> Anything Pumpkin is good in my book...</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, and this seems to be the best product I have ever used, never want to be without it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with WEN Cleansing Conditioner so when I saw the seasonal Pumpkin Ginger scent I knew I had to try it.  The sent is SO amazing!  If you love WEN and a characteristic Fall scent, give this a try - you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Yes, Wen is a great product for hair, but the focus of my review is on its amazing beard cleansing properties. I do not have an extremely long beard, but it&#x27;s long enough to where I need to wash it as hair. Soap and shampoo were KILLING my face! My beard was itchy and my chin was flaky and irritated. My wife had this product and convinced me to try it on my beard, within two washes, the irritation on my skin was gone, my beard wasn&#x27;t itchy anymore, and it has never been softer! Also, I shower in the morning, and the aroma of this product is quite invigorating when used in such close proximity to the nose. It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, and it rinses out very easily. Bravo for this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with Wen but I refuse to pay for there over priced subscription so I just order as much as I need. My hair has never been so heathy and feeling great, I&#x27;m use to spending a lot on my hair and have saved my self quite a bit now because this stuff replaces everything I use to use. Leave in conditioner, detangler, masks you name it. Plus this pumpkin on smells like heaven.</li>
    <li> I heard all good things about Wen products so I gave it a try. I purchased the ginger and pumpkin one and I really didn&#x27;t like the scent of it. To me it had a Vicks vapor rub scent! Maybe the other ones smell better. The good thing is that I didn&#x27;t have to use a separate conditioner and was very happy with the all-in-one which made my hair manageable. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather (I like lots of lather) and after 11 pumps, I didn&#x27;t feel it was cleaning enough. I have shoulder length hair and can&#x27;t imagine how many more pumps I would have to use if my hair was longer.. The result, for me, was just okay. My hair felt clean but just not that much of a difference than my other less expensive products, which I&#x27;ll go back to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened, I tried this product before and it was amazing but this time it didn&#x27;t  work well in my hair. Perhaps,it is the Ginger Pumpkin essence, because I always used the Almond .</li>
    <li> I was full of faith after watching infommercial. I have a lot of thick thick hair, maybe it was my hair. The product went on like a conditiner - did provide deep conditionaing feel. But before day was out, my hair just felt dirty and thick with stuff. Hard to explain really. I just never felt like my hair was clean. There are better, cheaper products out there that are natural, sulphite free etc. I just wanted to see if it was as good as the TV showed it - I just don&#x27;t think so. Maybe for the rich and famous who get papmered all the time. I paid $30 for this product - just not good value for the end result...I had hoped to have something more positive to say.</li>
    <li> Not sure I believe all the Wen hype. Certianly wouldn&#x27;t pay full price. I liked scent and it works fine but I still need a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this scent as I heard nothing but great reviews. However I am a little disappointed with the scent, it smells like more mint than pumpkin. I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the almond mint and this scent.</li>
    <li> As a devoted Wen purchaser, I particularly like the fragrance of the Ginger Pumpkin Cleansing Conditioner.  Although it is pricey, it is worth the money.  This product not only smalls a bit like a pumpkin pie, but it leaves my hair exceptionally manageable.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for less than a year. I never used it.  I kept it because I liked the way it smelled.  I have had it for only 10 months now. I went to open it up the other day and the twist knob around the opening was crusted.  That was odd. I opened it slowly, put my nose to it, and it was sour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just so glad I never used it.  Wen is a money hungry product line. It&#x27;s better to invent a few really excellent products, than a ton of some what okay to awful products.  This does not deserve even one star.</li>
    <li> this is all i use to clean my hair. it smells great and smooths down even my wild gray hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this cleanser is good for my hair but it leaves it feeling rather heavy like it has a coating on it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the product. Softens and conditions my hair! Does what it is supposed to do. Expensive, but i am worth it!</li>
    <li> loved the smell of this, and the feel of it! i wish i could use wen all the time but its expensive! i felt like i could smell the scent in my hair all day long! loved that about it! i would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the wen shampoos with mango being my favorite. I bought this one because it was one of the cheapest. It definitely reminds me of fall and smells like pumpkin pie.  Does the job like the other wen products.</li>
    <li> This seasonal formulation and the winter vanilla mint are my two most favorite of all the cleansing conditioners. nd the only reason why it is more expensive from this seller like many of you have noticed is because you wont be able to purchase it anywhere else for another year as this is a \\&quot;seasonal formulation\\&quot; and is no longer being sold anywhere else until fall. Thanks goodness somebody is still selling it (((:</li>
    <li> Love the product, but wasn&#x27;t too keen on the scent.</li>
    <li> I switch up from the Summer Mango Coconut to this Ginger Pumpkin in the summer.  I love Wen products.</li>
    <li> I use WEN exclusively for my long thick hair. WEN is great, but a bit pricey....it is worth it but I love to find discounts when I can...Thank you for allowing me to save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells so wonderful, and leaves your hair smelling so nice. I believe these are highly over priced -  the doing of Chaz, as the creator of the product, hence the 4 stars.  It does smell amazing though, and I have very curly hair, so it helps when it comes to styling my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the Wen hair products and was the least satisfied by the Ginger Pumpkin conditioner.  I don&#x27;t feel that it made my hair as shiny or soft as both the Almond and Winter Mint.  I felt that this particular conditioner did nothing more than a regular conditioner from the grocery store could have produced.</li>
    <li> It is important to use as instructed. I do not have long hair but thick hair, neck length. Amazon usually has a good price incentive to try it.  it is very different from what we are accustomed to using but it does leave hair feeling soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> The smell kind of throws you off, not exactly pumpkin, more menthol, at least in the bottle I got, but performance wise. VERY GOOD. I usually use fig because I bleach my hair and it is very dry, this worked very similar. Overall, very good!</li>
    <li> Chaz Dean shampoo has saved my hair. I color and bleach my hair. I am a dark brown and now my hair is blonde, with the shampoo my hair is like silk!!!!! Omg!!!! The smell is wonderful. Please give it a try if you have dry hair. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> ok, so it isn&#x27;t a dry shampoo, like I thought, you actually do have to wet your hair according to directions. My hair seems lighter, cleaner and less frizzy than with my regular shampoo. Nice clean smell.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Love how it makes my hair feel. My pump didn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t mind, just simply squeeze up on the bottle. Scent is nice, not strong once it&#x27;s washed out. The small amount left on hair after cleansing doesn&#x27;t leave a scent that&#x27;s noticeable either.</li>
    <li> Have tried 4 different scents of Wen.  This by far is my favorite.  It is a little thicker than the original Almond Mint, but less than Pomegranate.  For those who know what true pumpkin spice is with just a hint more clove...this is it.</li>
    <li> Does not perform as expected. Instead of my hair needing to be cleansed every 5 or 6 days, I need to use Wen every 3 days. In my opinion, not worth the expense!</li>
    <li> Wen is awesome stuff! Works wonders even for grey hair! Can&#x27;t say nothing bad about this stuff! Its wonderful!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, I have never used a shampoo that first lather and I have really dry hair.  This shampoo really moisturizes my hair without weighing it down.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love Wen products.  Some of the scents aren&#x27;t my favorites but I like this one.  I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair.  Feels so healthy now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a while.</li>
    <li> Love the wen!! My hair has never been happier with all the moisture and love I am giving it with wen.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging. Great product. Glad to fin in &amp;#34;off season&amp;#34;. Hint: use a little less, and make sure to wet hair thoroughly before using</li>
    <li> I am a Wen Girl through and through.. Have tried all of them.. The Seasonal&#x27;s are my Favorite and this Ginger Pumpkin is the BEST !!</li>
    <li> wonderful hair cleaning product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found a new hair system with WEN. I&#x27;m loving it. I&#x27;m a pumpking freak, so this was perfect, although the ginger overpowers the pumpkin. It&#x27;s still divine.</li>
    <li> This is my first Wen product and it won&#x27;t be my last, in fact I bought 2 more(one Ginger and pumpkin like the one I bought myself) and another one as Christmas gifts for my sister(she has bad hair lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old saying goes just a &amp;#34;little dab will do you&amp;#34; runs true with this product. Maybe pricy to some, but I have a feeling it will last longer then a large bottle of Pantene or Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> my family and I love this conditioner,its just like the commercials say it is,we love it and use it all the time</li>
    <li> This did not do well on my hair, like normal stand by, almond mint. My hair is very long and curly/wavy.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo</li>
    <li> I FIND THIS EVEN MORE HYDRATING THAN FIG WHICH IS SUPPOSE TO BE THE MOST HYDRATING .  AND WHEN MIXED WITH A SQUIRT OF LAVENDER, I FIND IT TO BE A PERFECT COMBINATION OF HYDRATION AND BODY FOR MY FINE THIN HAIR.  I REALLY DON&#x27;T WANT TO RUN OUT OF THIS ONE!  SINCE IT IS SEASONAL, MY FEAR IS CHAZ MAY NOT REPRODUCE IT.  PLEASE KEEP IT IN YOUR LINE, CHAZ!  THANKS FOR OFFERING IT, AMAZON.</li>
    <li> There is a very very fine print on the bottle, that tells you how much to use. And you have to use a lot! It takes forever to rinse it out, I had to repeat it once after taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;Only using it as a conditioner now every once in a while, too expensive to throw away</li>
    <li> Yes this is definitely ginger pumpkin spice wen. Does the same good cleansing as the other Wen fragrances, but a little goes a long way. This version of Wen can prove to be a little to spicy and burn. That&#x27;s the ginger oil in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen for the last year or so, usually the mint scented one.  I thought I would try this one, the pumpkin spice for a nice fall scent.  I read reviews about people&#x27;s hair falling out and thought, boy that&#x27;s gotta suck, I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t do that to me....then I tried pumpkin spice...and it happened.  I&#x27;m shedding like a dog in spring.  Must be something in the forumula.  I love Wen but warn others that it may not be the product itself but whatever is different in the scents.</li>
    <li> this stuff made my hair feel and look like hay. I hate it, im wondering if it was really wen in the bottle.or  was is something else that was put in a wen bottle. ive used wen before and loved it but this stuff that I ordered from amazon is horrible. I hate that I wasted so much money on this. after using this a few times I went to the store and bought my ole faithful pantene for 10x s less money and my hair looks and feels so much better.</li>
    <li> I had great expectations &amp; it&#x27;s just OK.  Wouldn&#x27;t be so bad of a product if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive - for the price it should come close to making miracles.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo it makes my hair feel soft and shiny.it give it more body and more manageable.love it love it</li>
    <li> This is a good product but probably not the best and certainly not worth the money. I probably needed more than one bottle but I refuse to spend this much on shampoo. If you want to try it, DO NOT pick the pumpkin one, the smell is terrible!</li>
    <li> I gave Wen a try as my hair is dry and was becoming more unmanageable.  I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  My hair feels clean and moisturized and is much more manageable.  I don&#x27;t lather twice, once is sufficient for me.  Love the fragrance!</li>
    <li> it works good I have really long hair so I have to use a lot. also the pump could be better. getting my hair cut so I will try again.</li>
    <li> I Love WEN and have been using it for years but this particular product has left my hair oily :-(</li>
    <li> It works ok, but I don&#x27;t care for the smell. Not really pumpkin, more ginger scented. Prefer the SIXTHIRTEEN better.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites of the ones I&#x27;ve tried. I would always get this one, but I do like some of the others.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever had for my hair. Very good for my hair. Would purchase again. Wonderful quick service</li>
    <li> I am a first time Wen user after using a generic brand and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be much different. I don&#x27;t think I would go out if my way to purchase again. May be a good purchase for other but It didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference to my very wavy and frizz prone hair.</li>
    <li> I like WEN and the smell of ginger and the smell of pumpkin. I guess just not all three together! I am going to use this up since I like the performance of the product but I can&#x27;t wait until I don&#x27;t have this smell in my hair anymore!</li>
    <li> Wen is a great product. It always leaves my hair feeling soft without weighing it down. The pumpkin scent is yhe perfect additive for the fall season.</li>
    <li> This is actually the scent that Wen produced last Fall and has a new scent this year.  I was surprised that Amazon had last year&#x27;s scent in stock.  I received it within two days and am thoroughly delighted!</li>
    <li> delicious spicy scent, cleans well</li>
    <li> SHAM-poo &#x3D; Guthy Renker THIEVES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This SHAMpoo does nothing special.</li>
    <li> I have been a Wen girl for five years, and this formula is one of my favorites. I&#x27;m 65, with waist-length, fine, silver hair, and Wen keeps my hair thick and healthy. The Ginger Pumpkin has a nice, mild scent and leaves my hair especially soft and not at all weighed down. I recommend using half the suggested amount, then rinsing and repeating. That makes my scalp feel really clean, and I only need to wash my hair twice a week. I like the regular formulas, but I love trying out the seasonal ones, and I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have permed and dyed hair, the first wash with this was alright. I love the smell though it was more like cloves than anything. I thought as I continued to use it it would get better. no. This was not right for my hair at all. I had my hair in a bun the whole time while using this. I switched back to a regular shampoo and conditioner and my hair is back to normal.</li>
    <li> Unless you want to smell like a Yankee candle, skip this scent.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and the formula is better than the other Wen cleansers in my opinion. Wish they did not discontinue this scent.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who wanted to try something new to help solve her problem with hair breaking off. She says it helps her hair feel soft and look shiny.  She said she doesn&#x27;t have to use it every day, and her hair still looks great.  She loves the pumpkin ginger fragrance. She will order more when this bottle is empty!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, it was great I didn&#x27;t even have to use a detangler to get the knots out but the next time I used it my hair was very greasy looking and it just got worse with each use I ended up trying it five times cause I really wanted it to work but it didn&#x27;t! I gave it to my mom that has a completely differnt hair type. So it just didn&#x27;t work For my hair type which is thick chemically treated with slight curl!!</li>
    <li> This is the best Wen ever made!  Chaz needs to bring back this scent.</li>
    <li> have tried several and this is absolutely my favorite.  I get many compliments on the aroma my hair has after using this.</li>
    <li> I tried using this shampoo many times and I finally decided I really don&#x27;t like it.  I kept thinking I wasn&#x27;t doing it right like not using the right amount, not getting it combed through well or not rinsing it well enough.  It just didn&#x27;t make my hair soft at all and, in fact, made it feel dry, especially on the ends.  Plus, it was expensive!</li>
    <li> Great product just to expensive!! Made my hair soft and smooth and healthy!! To bad it&#x27;s not affordable for&lt;br /&gt; the average jo!</li>
    <li> I though the smell would last longer  it smell good while washing but you couldnt smell it the&lt;br /&gt;Next day.</li>
    <li> works good, but i think it builds up after awhile since it is more like a conditioner than a shampoo. The pumpkin scent is strong. It bothered my scent allergies for the first few times of using it. It seems like it is pretty expensive for the results that I have had thus far.</li>
    <li> Yes this is my favorite wen flavor.  I like all of them but this one is just the bomb. My hair loves it too.</li>
    <li> smells good and made my hair so soft. with a week of use. buy it and you will not reget it.</li>
    <li> I usually have problems with hair shampoos, gels, mousse&#x27;s weighing my fine, thin hair down. With this product it has not been an issue. The scent is also quite enjoyable. I just wish the price was a little more tolerable!</li>
    <li> I love Wen and have been using the lavender regularly, I have found it to be a little more conditioning than the almond mint.  I love this equally.  It is excellent on my hair and does not have as much of a cooling sensation to it as the other versions, which I appreciate.  The scent is a nice change.  Smells like chai tea to me, YUM!  The new winter vanilla is awesome as well.</li>
    <li> Roughly equivalent to &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; your hair with a good quality multi-treatment Hand Lotion - like Vaseline Intensive Care at $4 per bottle. Oops !</li>
    <li> I love wen! Very over priced but worth it. Pumpkin is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Wen Girl, no doubt about it.  And I love the holiday scents, they smell amazing!!!  Wen Girl for Life!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a different fragrance so I ordered this one. I am not disappointed. I have been using WEN for 7+ years, it is expensive but I do not have any spit ends or dry hair. See my other WEN product review for specifics</li>
    <li> Just ok. All WEN products are ok once in a while but every day leaves my hair flat and lifeless.</li>
    <li> Wen shampoo works great! Love it! This is the best deal I&#x27;ve found on it yet. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent, ginger and pumpkin? Surprisingly smells great.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic give shine and shine to normaly dry straw like and dead hair and smells just like fall!</li>
    <li> I do like this one more than others.  The scent stays with you longer and for some reason it is a lot thicker than the other types.&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the amount of pumps &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; say.  I remember when this first came out it was 1/2 the amount of pumps, now it has doubled.  Therefore you can go thru bottle faster, purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;I only wash my hair twice a week so it last a very long time, perhaps upset Chaz a bit.</li>
    <li> WEN IS THE BEST CLEANING CONDITIONER AVAILABLE. I JUST GOT DONE USING IT AND HOPE MY HUSBAND GETS ME MORE FOR CHRISTMAS</li>
    <li> Always a Wen fan.  My hair has never felt this smooth and healthy!  Expensive but worth it.  Only wish is that styling spray and styling lotion came in all scents.  Love them.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent and am glad it is back this fall</li>
    <li> Meh... over conditioned my hair... I was expecting it to feel cleaner than what it was.</li>
    <li> Magic ! ! Why is it magic? I have greasy hair at the roots and bleach blond straw at the ends. It cleans the oily and conditions the dry ends...magic, one product does both. You must get the Wen comb to get the shampoo to the roots and I go heavy on the ends for the conditioning. Pumpkin smell is yummy any time of year.</li>
    <li> I understand that everyone is entitled to their opinion, but Chaz Dean does not use anything that is harmful in these products and also, I believe, most of them are now patented.  His products are tested and retested for safety.  I use all Wen products and never had a bad reaction.  I guess by shear number of users someone may dislike something.  I&#x27;ve seen alot of one and two star reviews on QVC&#x27;s site.  Wen saved my hair that used to look like an abandoned birds nest to hair that is to die for.  (like when I was a youngster)    Also, he knows people are allergic to wheat and gluten products so he made cleansers without those ingredients.  Anyway, in my review, I love the new Pumpkin cleanser.  It&#x27;s very creamy and good for those with coarse, dry hair.  My hair is fine, but alot of it.  I especially love the Six Thirteen.  Wow!  It smells good and the Pumpkin smells GREAT!  I was standing in the store and all of a sudden I smelled this sweet, but subtle smell of cinnamon and I thought ooohhh that smells good, and I realized that was me!  Because of the Wen I had just used.    I&#x27;m sorry for the poster that suffered with the headaches.  Don&#x27;t feel bad, I just had a root canal!  Yuk!  Hope you&#x27;re feeling better.  Look into the Six Thirteen and see if you can use that.  It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product makes my hair look everyone asks what have I done to my hair? it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Wow, let me tell you, I almost returned this stuff, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  To start, I have normal to dry hair, normally lots of body but slightly on the dry side with some split ends.  It&#x27;s wavy, not straight, not curly, just in between.  The first time I used the Wel Cleansing Conditioner, I followed the instructions perfectly, even combing the product through my hair.  I ended up with the ugliest, most unruly, wild head of hair I&#x27;d ever seen on my head.  I looked like I was raised by wolves, my hair looked like it multiplied 3 times in volume and gave a new meaning to the term \\&quot;big hair\\&quot;.  New Jersey girls had nothing on me, but it was awful, matted, I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers through it.  I had to use my child&#x27;s \\&quot;no more tangles\\&quot; to get the matting out.  Then I used the Wen styling cream in my dry hair and that calmed it down a bit.  I was SO disappointed, but I had remembered in reading other reviews that it takes more than one use, so I gave it an honest shot and used it again, but this time I also used the Wen styling cream when my hair was still wet.  It was an improvement, and each time I used it, my hair looked better and healthier.  It never does that huge matted effect any more.  Now I like it, but I think it makes a difference to use the styling cream, too, which I always use after cleansing with the Wen cleansing conditioner.  I usually mix a little bit of the cleansing conditioner with the styling cream, maybe 1 part cleansing cond. to 2 or 3 parts styling cream.  I will be buying more, and will likely try the different scents, too.  One piece of advice.  I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and starting to get gray hair, so I touch up my roots every few weeks with color.  A day before I color my hair, I shampoo with ordinary baby shampoo, mostly at the root area, and just let it rinse through the rest, so that the color will take.  I once read that advice from another user review and it does make a difference.  Then just go back to using the Wen.  The pumpkin smells nice,but I don&#x27;t really notice the scent once my hair is dry.  Maybe I just tune it out, though, because it&#x27;s with me all the time.  Overall, I give it 4 stars because it&#x27;s overpriced in my opinion, but a decent product.  May not work for all hair types, but DEFINITELY use it 3 or 4 times before you form an opinion and write a review, because it can make a world of a difference.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad but I noticed that I lost hair- that was different--I just didn&#x27;t like the way it felt after washing .</li>
    <li> Amazing product.... period.&lt;br /&gt;I have used tons of different products in my hair and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  I have dry skin, so my scalp hasn&#x27;t escaped that fact.  I have hair to my waist, so to keep it smooth and shiny I need something that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.  I think that the criticism for this product is because the users didn&#x27;t  apply it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. dont wash your hair every day.  If you have &amp;#34;oily&#x27;&amp;#34; hair then you probably have stripped it out and your pores are working overtime to fix the issue.  I finally convinced my daughter of that and now she has lovely hair with no problems at all&lt;br /&gt;2. using this product as a leave in can  be iffy...  true.  However you need to experiment with alternatives.  (Like Biotin&#x27;s leave in)&lt;br /&gt;3. dont wash your hair every day&lt;br /&gt;4. make sure the water you use isn&#x27;t too hot.  Extra hot water will dry your whole body out, especially your hair&lt;br /&gt;5. I love the pumpkin smell, but these are all the same so if you don&#x27;t like this one, then try another.&lt;br /&gt;6. Thick hair, works great.  Mine is fine, but my daughter&#x27;s hair is super thick.  Works fine on both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very frugal (cheap) but I will pay for this product because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For first time users, this feels and goes on like conditioner.  So don&#x27;t worry if it doesn&#x27;t lather, its not supposed to.  Just put in hair at beginning of shower, massage it in completely to ends, then leave in while you soap up the rest of your body, shave your legs/face, etc... rinse at the end... leaving it in longer will only make your hair nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For tangly hair, use spray oil that does not have alcohol.  NEVER USE ALCOHOL PRODUCTS ON YOUR HAIR!  Ever!!!</li>
    <li> Saw this item and immediately wanted to try this fall edition. It is a great scent paired with great service!</li>
    <li> First off, please understand that I ordered the Ginger Pumpkin kit DIRECTLY FROM GUTHY-RENKER... big mistake. I placed my order a nearly full month before Christmas (11/27/12) and it didn&#x27;t even ship until (1/10/13). I haven&#x27;t even received my product yet and I called to cancel my account for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Took way too long to get the product to me. I called about a month in to see if changing my scent to something in stock would help expidite the process. They said no, the old order would be cancelled, a new order would be placed and with processing, etc. I could face even longer delays. No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. In the 2 months I&#x27;ve been waiting for product, I&#x27;ve been able to try OTHER cleansing conditioners that work just fine for me and are SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER! L&#x27;Oreal has one that is great and is only about $5-$6 a bottle. Salon Matrix has one that is nice too, I&#x27;m just not a big fan of the citrus-y scent, but the results are nice. Similar pricing and available at your local Walmart or Target stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I ordered at the end of November, having my holiday budget established. The charges did not come out until now, of course, after the holidays, after I&#x27;ve spent a bit outside of my budget to accomdate holiday gifts, my daughter&#x27;s birthday and my husband&#x27;s birthday. My checking account overdrafted, which has never happened to me and I&#x27;m embarrassed about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when this stuff actually gets here, I better step out of the shower looking exactly like Alyssa Milano. I basically have every intention of using it up, sending back my empties and demanding a refund. If you&#x27;re dying to try this product, DO NOT ORDER DIRECTLY FROM GUTHY-RENKER! What a pain in the neck!</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for years!  I love this stuff&amp;#34;.  I was afraid it would not cleanse well, it does.  My fair feels better, looks so much better.  I have tried many hair products this product is the best.  My hair looks great</li>
    <li> Never thought I would get sucked in to a Shampoo.  Wen products work just like they say they do.  I was amazed!  Don&#x27;t give up after one shampoo.  Have been using it for a month and I will never use store bought again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I really like the scent and will post an update after I&#x27;ve used it a bit more.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She followed the directions and the result was hair that looked greasy/dirty.  At about $30 for a pint I expected this product to wow, it didnt.</li>
    <li> This product is in the back of the cabinet collecting dust. I used it for two weeks; it made my hair feel weighted down and greasy, heavy and lifeless. I&#x27;m back to my old routine consisting of three products for what one failed to deliver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m AA and relaxed.  Fall Ginger Pumpkin is great.  It has soy protein so it makes more a of a protein based conditoner than my fig.  I think that moisture/protein balance is important because I am relaxed.  I can also feel the difference using this instead of the fig.  While the fig jus melts into my hair, this makes my hair feel soft, but a bit rougher just like when I use a reg protein conditioner.  Don&#x27;t  get me wrong, it still feels good, but it feels stronger, I guess.  While I like the fig, it gets my hair too soft if I use it too much.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really weird because after I do a long rinse, I comb my hair and put some more in as a leave in.  I put my towel on my hair and it dries faster.  My hair feels so good it&#x27;s weird to me.  Like it&#x27;s magic or something.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to order more.  I think the WEN system is great but I still clarify and I&#x27;m still using other conditioners for my dc&#x27;s.  WEN is a bit too expensive to use for everything but even if you use it for a conditioner, your hair will really thank your.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the pumpkin and the ease of the use.  and It makes my hair much more manageable.</li>
    <li> This product was a terrible disappointment. I tried it once before but decided to give it another chance. It will clean your hair but so does&lt;br /&gt;store bought shampoo. It does nothing to manage your hair or get rid of frizz. I have oily hair. It did not make it oilier but my hair also gets&lt;br /&gt;frizzy and dry after shampooing. After using this product the first time and again this time my hair is just as dry and frizzy after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. The best thing that works on my frizzy hair is to take a 400IU of vitamin E capsule per day.</li>
    <li> Love the product. This shampoo smells awesome! Reasonable priced and very quick delivery. I would recommend this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> hav used the product before; performs as expected</li>
    <li> Of all of the Wen fragrances this one was so sickening sweet it smells like pumpkin pie.  I really enjoy the Sweet Almond Mint and the Lavendar to tell you my threshold.  This one after awhile began to bothered me so much I was glad when it was finally gone.  It did not change the feel and texture of my hair compared to the other Wen products, it was just very hard to stand the smell.  I probably should have known because who really wants to smell like pumpkin pie?  If you do, go for it!</li>
    <li> shipped very fast, I got it before the anticipated date of delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used wen many times and it works incredibly well on my dry course hair.  The smell of the pumpkin is not overwhelming and is pleasant.</li>
    <li> My best friend uses it and adores it. I tried it at her house and it was okay. I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance, but I got exactly the same results I got previously: it&#x27;s too intense for my very very fine hair. It is terrific for my friend&#x27;s curlier coarser (and much thicker!) hair, but it&#x27;s too intense for me and mine. Worse yet, it makes my hair fall out. This is a product that works wonderfully well on the right combination and type of hair, but it isn&#x27;t for everyone. I&#x27;m one of the people for whom it is NOT wonderful.</li>
    <li> I started using Wen about 6 months ago and will never ever go back to regular shampoo and conditioner.  Leaves my hair so soft and beautiful!</li>
    <li> LOVE this formula! It smells like fall. I&#x27;ve been using WEN for many years and have tried several fragrance/formulas but this one has to be my favorite. I really wish Chaz would make it a permanent part of his line. (This year&#x27;s fall fragrance, Apple Spice, is ok but can&#x27;t hold a candle to the Ginger Pumpkin.)</li>
    <li> I love how this smells. It really does smell like autumn and my husband loves the scent as well.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This was the cheaper one of the Wen collection so I bought it.  I love the smell.  I will admit though that I do still use regular shampoo after the gym.  There is something about actual suds that makes me feel cleaner.  I have very oily hair, and I haven&#x27;t had any oil issues (I wash every other day).  Use the whole amount it suggests though to get best results, don&#x27;t skimp. My hair needs no other product except the wanna look nice flat iron, but daily nothing.  If you go to the website it signs you up for monthly delivery and credit card installments, so amazon is the better choice in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it so much that I actually bought a second bottle because I thought I must be doing something wrong when the first bottle didn&#x27;t impress me. I watch his infomercials on tv and those models&#x27; hair is so beautiful. But I am now throwing in the towel. This product just doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair. In fact, I think it made my hair more dry, fly-away and hard to manage. Won&#x27;t order a third bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try it, but it wasn&#x27;t all that I thought it would be. I have learned that I just need to go with my hair, that&#x27;s just the way it is.</li>
    <li> I started using Wen about 4months ago and will not be using regular shampoo again. My daughter loves it as well! We usually use the Sweet Almond Mint and tried the Ginger Pumkin for the first time last week and its really nice as well great smell, same great results. Will try the Cucumber scent next! Just wish the price was a bit better I find it a little expensive and it doesn&#x27;t last very long beacause you have to use so much (I have long thick hair).</li>
    <li> I loved this product. The smell was fabulous and worked well for me. I would suggest this item to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love anything by WEN. Wonderful products! Just be sure you follow the instructions sent with your order. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Doesnt work like other wen products. No smell, no silky hair. Very disappointed. Ordered the vanilla mint and i am happy again!</li>
    <li> Love this product but hate the price.  Very expensive for no longer than it lasts.  If better if free shipping but still expensive.  Would buy more often if was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great scent and the Ginger Pumpkin Conditioner leaves my scalp tingly fresh.  Nice change of pace to Sweet Almond Mint.</li>
    <li> order was easy. item came as described and arrived when it was supposed to. everything worked. cant be better than that</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past...it smells amazing and makes my hair shine! Try it! Follow the directions and rinse WELL. I&#x27;ll bet you will never go back to damaging shampoos.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling greasy, overpriced.</li>
    <li> Not so sure I like the pumpkin fragrance though;  it smells medicinal to me.  I will try a different kind next time.  So far, I think it lives up to the Wen reputation as far as helping the condition of my hair.  I have noticed great success with other people I know who are using it.</li>
    <li> I wanted sodium laurel sulfate free shampoo. This product is good. A bit expensive. I try to find the one&#x27;s on sale. It is a little heavy in my hair, but I have very fine hair. The smell is wonderful. It&#x27;s easy to use. I only use about half of recommended pumps and it seems to work fine. Tried the lavender one as well, and it worked about the same. Seemed to be a bit lighter on my hair leaving less &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; look a day later.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for over a year and when I use his cleansing conditioners, my hair looks shiny and healthy and I get lots of compliments on it.  After using this, my hair still feels dry and doesn&#x27;t look shiny and healthy like it does when I order directly from Chaz Dean&#x27;s website or QVC.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen in the past, but at the time it was just too expensive for me.  I really loved the product.  I couldn&#x27;t use the recommended amount so I would split it up with two washes.  It worked perfectly.  I decided to buy the Ginger Pumpkin because I thought it would smell fresh and clean.  It does have a scent, but once on your hair it has a very very light scent, which I didn&#x27;t like because I bought the product because of the scent.  The problem I have with this product is I can&#x27;t get the right amount for my hair.  I&#x27;ve gone down from the high pump to eight pumps.  I decided I would split them in half.  This products still leaves my hair feeling oily at the back of my head.  It&#x27;s heavy and feels nothing like I remember.  I&#x27;m kinda disappointed.  This product is good for all types of hair.  I haven&#x27;t decided yet to try a different cleansing conditioner.  I&#x27;m sure it would be great for some, but this time it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Makes the hair so clean,soft, and shiny. And my hair is long, and it lasts. Never had a hair product as good as this so far.</li>
    <li> Wen products are not supposed to lather and this product lathered and it seemed to dry out my hair.  I have used Wen for about 2 years now.</li>
    <li> Still trying to decide.</li>
    <li> Like the way my hair looks and feels the smell of ginger and pumpkin is really nice have received many complements recently I&#x27;m sure the reason is Wen  cleanser conditioner.</li>
    <li> It worked great for a week or so, then it was like any other product, my hair became drab again.. I guess my hair becomes accustomed to something and needs change often.  I used the rest to shave and love it as a shaving lotion.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Wen cleansing conditioner product.  I LOVE this product.  I had immediate results.  Not only did my hair feel better after the first wash (softer, no tangles) it looked better too.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to but I don&#x27;t smell any scent at all and that&#x27;s disappointing I&#x27;m sticking with the sweet almond honey and the fig</li>
    <li> I love Wen products.  I have tried other products that have said they are the same, but they are not.  I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleansing conditioner for my curly hair style. My hair has body and not dried out.  However, I did need to use another shampoo and conditioner a few times during the month so I didn&#x27;t have a built up. My hair stylist also had me wash with another type of shampoo prior to having my hair colored.</li>
    <li> I have dry, thin hair. Within a few hours of using this conditioner, my hair is lifeless and oily. By the end of the day, it looks as though I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a week. It also makes my scalp itch for several hours after I use it. I tried using a regular shampoo and conditioning with this. It didn&#x27;t help. It smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used wen for the last year and won&#x27;t ever go back to a regular shampoo and conditioner. Leaves your hair is great shape and clean</li>
    <li> This is my first WEN purchase.  A bit disappointed as there is virtually no scent to this..either it is an old bottle that has lost its potency or a bad batch, I don&#x27;t know.  Makes my hair shiny, but not necessarily more manageable with body. WEN is a bit pricey so I purchased Hair One and it is almost identical and half the price.  Don&#x27;t think I will purchase WEN again, only if it is on sale.</li>
    <li> its expensive but WOW my hair looks great. Esp curly hair. The pumpkin was my fav smell for this product. Many of them have a sickly sweet smell and the pomegranate smells like cough syrup but this one was great! I found the generic does a good job, but the original outshines it.</li>
    <li> My hair is almost to my bum and very fine. It tangles very easy.  Really wanted to try this product and thankfully got it for a gift the first time.  I was so impressed with how clean, shiny and manageable my hair was I wanted to use it all of the time.  It recommends 40 pumps for my hair.  I have it down to 15-20. It is so worth it.  When I have tried to wash my hair with regular shampoo a couple of times thinking I could not afford this Wen, I was not satisfied with my tangled hair.  I do not have to wash my hair as often although I normally like to every day. But for the price, I will save it.&lt;br /&gt;Wen goes in like conditioner and rinses out easier than shampoo.  It only suds a little when you rinse it out.  The product is very thick so I add just a little water as I am shampooing to distribute it through my hair.  Do not forget your wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> My long curly hair is soft, shiny and not weighed down. Summer Mango Coconut is also great! Love Sweet Almond Mint. Winter Vanilla Mint and Spring Gardenia Green Tea are next on my list.</li>
    <li> My hair feels amazing with this! Love the smell as well!</li>
    <li> Love it, it gives life to otherwise dull hair.  Buy it you will never regret it...you too will never go back to full of detergents shampoos!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before. I like the idea of using it &amp;#34;once&amp;#34; while washing my hair. I am up at 4 am getting ready for work. The last thing I want to do is spend too much time on my hair. This product smells great. Keeps my hair soft. However the pump does not work! I have tried and tried. So now I have to un-screw it and &amp;#34;pour&amp;#34; from the bottle. Since it is very thick....no easy task.</li>
    <li> Not the best smelling Wen product, but at this price I could not pass it up!  Wen is absolutely great product, especially for sensitive skin, scalp and hair.  This is less $$ than when I purchase direct- so I don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s not my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent from WEN, aside from Lavender and Cucumber Mint. I use it as a conditioner only and wash my scalp with special shampoo that treats oily scalp and it works great! Using this as a shampoo and conditioner works for the first few weeks but created more build up then I would have preferred.</li>
    <li> the smell was terrible. no like. made my hair too heavy and oily. I do not recommend this product. did not like it.</li>
    <li> Seller was great. Shampoo is wonderful. Highly recommend it. I have tried several wen shampoos for fine long dry hair &amp;#34;pumpkin spice&amp;#34; is the best. Leaves hair smooth and it shines!</li>
    <li> Loved the product. Makes my hair soft and easy to manage. Seller was great and got the product to me in good time.</li>
    <li> This made my hair smell so wonderful. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far, so good. My hair blew out smoother and feels softer than usual, and there&#x27;s no greasy residue at the roots.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. It has a nice smell to it as well. This is the first I have bought any Wen products, it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
    <li> Delightful light fragrant scent.  Creamy wash.  Leaves hair with a nice shine.  Be sure to read and follow directions for best results.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about it.  Wife loves it.  Only negative: It is a bit thick and difficult to get from the very bottom of the bottle..</li>
    <li> Not good at all! Smells bad and it made my hair greasy and gross. Sucks because they are expensive. I will only stick to the Sweet Almond Mint, which by using Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils and unscented shampoo you can make yourself.</li>
    <li> I got this Wen because of the ginger; I do love the smell. It seems heavier than the other cleansing conditioners I have purchased by Wen, and that translates into limper hair for me (fine, thin, straight hair). This might be great for someone with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I always use Wen Cleansing Conditioner as it feels amazing on my hair,  I am 5&#x27;9&amp;#34; with Hula hair (below my rear), so I am VERY careful on what I put on my hair.  This makes your hair feel smooth and comb out is effortless,.</li>
    <li> I have short, coarse hair and the Wen hair cleanse is perfect. I color my hair routinely and out in the sun/sand often. Wen is helping me make the transition to NO other hair care products, thx!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it or any Wen product! Continued use makes your hair fall out. It may work really well at first, but after over a year, my hair has started falling out more than normal, and other customers have gotten bald spots! I am a healthy 20 something year old, and I will NOT be using this anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen Cleansing Conditioner for about a year. I love what it does for my hair, but was never a big fan of the most popular scents (Sweet Almond Mint &amp; Pomegranate). Ginger Pumpkin was purchased &amp;#34;off season&amp;#34; at a discounted price. I already loved the fall smells so I didn&#x27;t care if it wasn&#x27;t the current seasonal offering. I&#x27;d use this one all year. The product arrived in perfect condition and in good time.</li>
    <li> I love this product, use it only now. Just wish that the pump went further down into the bottle to get the last bit of the cleanser.</li>
    <li> Works great. Much better than regular shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Wen makes my frizzy hair smooth.  My hair brakes less and has grown several inches in the last few months.</li>
    <li> did I order the wrong product that is supposed to be so great by Wen?  My hair didn&#x27;t last 6 hours before it felt disgusting...this works well as a conditioner after I use regular shampoo..but it didn&#x27;t clean.  perhaps I misunderstood what is meant by Cleansing Conditioner?  It&#x27;s too expensive to throw out, and at least I dont seem to be allergic to it...the smell isn&#x27;t bad, and it doesn&#x27;t linger in the hair after rinsins, so that&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this up as my conditioner...and maybe try again with just a shampoo..maybe...for the price, i really thought I was going to be blown away. AFter a week of just this product, i simply coundlt stand it anymore and broke out my old regular shampoos to get the grunge out of my hair and off my scalp.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and leaves my hair supple and light.  It is great at cleaning but not stripping the hair and feels like a conditioner usually used after shampoo. It&#x27;s great to have it all in one step.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product yet but i am very happy with the products i have used so far.</li>
    <li> This scent is nice but I liked the sweet almond mint and pomegranate the best biut each head of hair is different Amazon offers some really good prices if you just want to try it out</li>
    <li> Tried this for at least 3 weeks to a month exclusively.  I found that even using their recommended amount, my hair at times felt a bit weighed down and could not style it straight.  I know I was doing it right,  scrubbed well got the &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; but still felt I needed something to cleanse more.  It did make the lengths of my hair feel soft and nice, but the scalp area seemed to dirty more quickly.  For reference I have lots of fine long hair down to my bra strap.  I could not rationalize the price of this for how quickly they are recommending you go through it.  Maybe I need another type of wen?  Not willing to make that investment right now though.</li>
    <li> Wen leaves my fine, color-treated hair glossy and full of body.  Also soothes my scalp.  I haven&#x27;t used shampoo in three years, and I don&#x27;t miss it one bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pumpkin Ginger is my favorite formula. It&#x27;s very moisture rich and the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have fine but curly frizzy hair.  Just use it a couple times per week.  Really does a great job!  I use it on towel dry hair before styling too...great frizz control...my hair is soft and still curly...great product.</li>
    <li> Great great great shampoo. I have fine, thin blonde hair. My hair looks and feels fuller. Bought some for my mother and sister and they love it as well. My mother&#x27;s hair is even finer and thinner than mine and she&#x27;s in love with the product. Have tried about 5 fragrances of Wen and love them all.</li>
    <li> I have had the other fragrences like the Almond Mint and Cucumber... this one is Yummy ;)&lt;br /&gt;And works just as well as the others...Clean fresh hair!</li>
    <li> I love Wen and the delicious scent of this shampoo is a sensuous delight. It leaves a light, subtle fragrance in my hair that gets compliments all day. Perfect Fall scent and no one does it better than Wen.</li>
    <li> Smells like fall... spicy.  I kinda smell like pumpkin pie.</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine hair, shoulder-length, colored (although not frequently). My hair tended to break off and just...not be the hair I wanted. It was not shiny, not strong, lifeless and damaged. Like others on here, I finally bit the bullet and bought the Wen trial kit at Sephora. After that was used up, I bought the pumpkin. I have to say, it&#x27;s really good - my hair is shiny, strong - and suddenly, it&#x27;s growing! (Probably just not breaking off constantly.) I can take a thick handful of hair now - really nice. And the gloss on it! Wow! I tell my kids I&#x27;m actually having to get used to my hair looking this good - it even looks better in photos. It feels \\&quot;fat\\&quot; and bouncy. It smells great. I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about 7-8 weeks so far, and I&#x27;m very pleased. It might not be for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth trying for a month and see what you think. I didn&#x27;t see improvement immediately - give it a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I love the pumpkin-y scent.  As with all WEN products, it makes my hair so manageable, smooth and shiny.  I am addicted to using this in the fall and could not get it from WEN this year.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen Cleansing Conditioner since May 2012. I have medium fine hair and it would never grow much past my shoulders without becoming shaggy, broken off and damaged looking.  My hair has never looked better. The new growth is shiny and strong and the ends have even improved in texture.  I&#x27;m a couple of haircuts away from 100% Wen hair!  This pumpkin flavor smells delicious and reminds me that it&#x27;s fall!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the original WEN. It&#x27;s smell is okay but hair did not feel as soft as with the original</li>
    <li> smells nice but I came to the conclusion that it was actually making my hair thin out and come out in clumps. I stopped using it and my hair stopped falling out.</li>
    <li> Never made my hair look clean. Always looked and felt greasy.</li>
    <li> I use Wen cleansing conditioner and have used Wen products exclusively for about 3 years. I am a very satisfied customer and will continue to purchase my products through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love Wen cleansing conditioner &amp; have used it on my hair for quite a while now. (since I had a perm that really dried out my hair in addition to having my hair color \\&quot;go down the drain\\&quot; faster than desired.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I smelled my daughter&#x27;s Wen hair spray, I have wanted the Pumpkin cleanser!  But unfortunately, since it is only sold seasonally (around October), so I was happy to see is sold on Amazon and even a better price than the Wen site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A happy customer here!</li>
    <li> I just am not a fan of the strong mint smell. The mint smell overpowers the ginger pumpkin.but great for pumpkins season for what its worth</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the scent. It didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned my hair. Not sure if there was something wrong with the batch.</li>
    <li> It makes you feel like a film is covering your hair, you really have to rinse this stuff out. My hair didn&#x27;t feel clean or healthier either</li>
    <li> I have been using wen for several years. Some of my favorite scents are the seasonal ones. I was happy to find this one on your site due to Wen was not offering it at this time.</li>
    <li> My hair looks shinier and feels softer when I use this.  It recommends using something like 15 pumps; but I find that 5 is more than enough for my fine, mid-length hair.  If you use enough to thoroughly saturate your hair, that should do the trick.  I love the smell of the ginger pumpkin.  This is now my preferred shampoo, and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute BEST shampoo/conditioner I have ever used in my life!  Even though it&#x27;s a little spendy, if you consider what you would have spent on all the other hair products, leave in conditioners, shampoos etc. It&#x27;s more than a steal.  Can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.  I wish I would have found it a long time ago and I will NEVER go back to using regular shampoo again.  This scent was awesome, but any of the Wen scents are great, including the original.  It does everything they say it will and then some.  It makes your hair the shiniest, most conditioned, bouncy, healthy hair you&#x27;ve ever had!  Go for it!  You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Regarding Wen shampoos, nothing to add from most other reviews other than I have finally beaten the flakes!  Lifetime user from now on.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and described. The product came before expected date, what a pleasant surprise! This stuff smells great! Would recommend product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I have never found a product that I enjoy as much as Wen.  And this is one of my favorite holiday scents~</li>
    <li> Im a male i have got thick curly hair but its also really lightweight and dries out easily. I was hoping this wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and puffy. But it did. I gave it to my girlfriend and she and her mom loved it and they both use it now. I guess its just not for every hair type like the TV said</li>
    <li> Wen, I find out, is only good for a certain kind of hair.  I would say if you have very curly or coarse, unruly hair, this would be great.  Smells great, but it weighs my hair down.  It is way too heavy for me.  I would recommend this for certain hair types, but not mine.</li>
    <li> The smell after you wash your hair is so different from other products, I love pumpkin and spice scents.  I also have the pumpkin oil and leave in spray conditioner, just as awesome!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this fragrance!  My favorite of all time.  i&#x27;m bummed that it won&#x27;t be available for this coming fall.</li>
    <li> Do not get this product if you have thin, fine hair. It does NOT do what it claims even when you go strictly by the directions! I also started getting head aches after several washings. cannot say for sure it was this product but they went away as soon as i stopped using Wen.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair that is not straightened or colored - it&#x27;s in very good shape. I had hoped Wen would do wonders and it worked OK but I wasn&#x27;t blown over by the results. I&#x27;ve used 1/2 the bottle since I&#x27;ve received it, according to directions, and my hair is still a little frizzy. Honestly, I can get the same results using a good quality brand name shampoo and a very light conditioner at Walmart.  The results do not out weight the cost plus shipping, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m grateful I had the chance to try it through Amazon.com and not get entrenched in trying to cancel an auto delivery order through Wen.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair very soft and manageable. but it burns the dickens out of my head every time I shampoo my hair with it. I have actually developed a rash on my arm from using it in the shower. But the stuff does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do. My thought is I may not be able to leave it on in the shower like it said but wash it directly off. In all it is a good product smells really good...</li>
    <li> Love how this product works for my hair! I only have to wash my hair twice a week, and don&#x27;t need to use conditioner anymore.  I don&#x27;t like the menthol, it makes me thing twice about getting more Wen.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. I bought it for my thinner, short, wavy hair and for my daughter who has thick, very curly hair. It weighed our hair down and really didn&#x27;t do anything helpful for either of us. The pumpkin spice smelled medicinal.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this scent.  Wen as a product is nice, but not that much better than any other shampoo, but this scent is heavenly and leaves hair feeling fabulous.  It&#x27;s a particularly great for travel.  Just wish they provided it year round!</li>
    <li> I love wen...i live in an area of west texas and our water is horrible...theres alot of chemicals in the water and before moving here i had healthy hair that fell to my waist...within the past five years i have had to cut my hair up to my shoulder blades because the water has made my hair so dry and brittle...since using the wen...i have noticed very minimum breakage in the bottom of the tub and my hair is super shiny...thank you wen!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not smell anything like pumpkin or ginger and only made my hair greasy. I ended up throwing it away as I was even embassased to give it away or donate it.</li>
    <li> I have used the mint in the past, for my unruly very curly hair, and loved it.  this is the first time I have order pumpkin and it is fantastic,  it smells yummy and is thick.  it works well on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the Wen Ginger Pumpkin cleansing conditioner, however I hate that I didn&#x27;t realize it was only 16 ounces.  The price I paid was too much and would not have ordered it.</li>
    <li> Very nice sent and works as expected for WEN users. No issues with product</li>
    <li> lost hair... smells great though</li>
    <li> Great flavor/scent, but I prefer the fig variety.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet if I like the fact tht it&#x27;s non sudsing. I feel like I have to use alot of product to get it through all of my hair. Also it is VERY expensive. 16 oz. was $36! I&#x27;m a hairdresser and this is extravagant when you can buy two liters of a great product for only $20 at the beauty supply. Guess will wait and see how my highlighted hair feels after the bottle is empty before I can really make a fair comment about product quality. Just not sure if I can afford it even if is IS a shampoo and conditioner!!! :(</li>
    <li> What can I say, another WEN hit. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  Great for diet angling my young daughters hair.</li>
    <li> The Wen line of hair care products is exceptional. It&#x27;s the only brand I use, or need, and my hair is substantially improved....even my hairdresser has commented on the condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews however on this product I feel I must. Due to my aging hair, the coloring process and the styling procedure, my hair has seen better days. My hair was brittle and breaking so I desperately needed help.  Wen has proven to not only repair the damage it has improved the condition of my hair tremendously. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I love how chaz Dean cleanses my hair, and how manageable my hair is.My hair is long and  I do not have the dry ends that regular shampoo will give you. It states on the bottle that friends don&#x27;t let friends use shampoo this statement is true.</li>
    <li> Wen is hard for me I loved the smell of this! But I can not use this like shampoo, my hair gets to greasy and almost feels like it is coated with something,  I have very thick hair and it adds too much volume, ( I know that sounds crazy but if you have coarse thick hair you know what I mean)  I don&#x27;t need volume.  I do like to use it and love the smell but I use it 2 times a week and alternate with shampoo and that seems to work perfect.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite scent. I like the Winter Vanilla and Almond Mint best.</li>
    <li> Wen is the only brand we use. With natural curls It leaves them soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> no more regular shampoo for me. it does cleans the hair. and my hair is so soft.  I took a chance of ordering this product. and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> Works great but not fond of the scent.</li>
    <li> wen is a great product.  will buy again.  Thank you.  Perfect for any type of hair.  Love the smell also.</li>
    <li> I used Wen for 3 weeks and my hair started falling out!</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair look oily.  I have natural curly hair and wear it natural except for I flat iron my bangs.  I do not dry my hair with a blow dryer I let it dry naturally.  At first I thought I wasn&#x27;t rinsing it well enough but no matter how long I rinse it it is still oily looking when it dries.  I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have fine aging hair that, as I age, is also getting thinner. I loose less hair in the shower now, and tangles are all gone! My hair looks shiny and healthier.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my boys hair.  My boys are 50% African American, 25% Puerto Rican and 25% Asian Indian. So, their hair is tricky. This stuff handles their hair better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> well it really does smell like fall in a bottle..but maybe a bit too much.. very spicy pumpkin smell..but i was shocked how nice my hair came out.only problem....WAY to much $$$ they dont tell you that you need to use 10-20 pumps every time you use it!!! EAK!!</li>
    <li> I like Wen products. I do think the products are very pricey however. I get the same results from the less expensive cleansing conditioners.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this and tried it.  Have used Wen&#x27;s sweet almond mint for years and never knew about this one.  It&#x27;s far far more luxurious and makes your hair even more voluminous, shiny and soft than any other Wen cleansing conditioner.  Hope it&#x27;s available forever!  heehee  I bought 4 and that should last almost a year.  Would recommend for everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and my hair is very dry now, this product makes my hair look so much healthier.  I&#x27;m sold on Wen produscts</li>
    <li> It took a little getting used to not having lots of suds. but you don&#x27;t need that ,leaves hair clean and conditioned.</li>
    <li> Love Wen!!! I have oily very hair and didn&#x27;t think it was going to work for me but, a friend gave me some and told me to just use it for four days. Well I was sold after the first use! I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair! It feels like silk and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way my hair feels after using this conditioner! I really have noticed a difference in my hair&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> Works as good as others that were much costlier.  I like the smell and texture of this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have tried this product. The tv shows smooth silky hair after using this product. Only if your hair is smooth and silky before will it be that way.  Doesn&#x27;t help at all with dry hair. Really wanted it to work but not so. I will say it cleans your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN products over 2 years now and my hair looks wonderful so therefore it gets a 5 star rating. I have used many shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner&#x27;s over the years (not to mention very expensive products) and nothing compares to WEN. I love the cleansing conditioner and I try and get a different scent each time due to they have so many available and it leaves my hair shiny and conditioned and it smells great!! I would recommend it to anyone who wants beautiful hair at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Wen suggests 10-20 pumps per use (20-30 for long hair). Here&#x27;s the bottom line: 10 pumps is almost 1 oz and 20 pumps is almost 2 oz, so your 16 oz bottle gives you 8-16 days of use (less than 6-8 days if you have long hair). For $26/16 oz, that means you will spend $1.60 to $4.80 PER DAY (I&#x27;m rounding here). That&#x27;s $48 to $144 per month! Sorry, but I didn&#x27;t notice any hair difference worth that.</li>
    <li> I do not use it everyday but when I use it about once a week my hair looks good.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this product and you can not beat this price.  I definitely hope to order more again in the future.</li>
    <li> left my hair greasy, i like the pomegranate one better.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing conditioner, my hair feels very healthy, &amp; soft!!! I will buy this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and not too strong.</li>
    <li> I have been a Wen girl for 2 years, and my hair is healthier, silkier, and longer than ever.  I ran out a few months ago, and did not have money to order any more, so I was forced to go back to shampoo for about a week, and it was just GROSS.  I never want to use shampoo again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many of the formulations - Tea Tree, Pomegranate, Sweet Almond Mint, Cucumber, Gardenia, and my all-time favorite, Orange Blossom.  All that being said, I thought I liked the Pumpkin, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, about a week after I began using it, I started getting very severe migraines!  I have been getting migraines regularly for decades due to a traumatic brain injury and digestive diseases, so I did not make the connection at first.  I have been going crazy the past 6 weeks trying to figure out why they suddenly got SO much worse.  I was seriously thinking that I would have to quit working and go on disability...they have been THAT bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I remembered reading reviews that it gave some people migraines.  Thank you so much to the others who&#x27;ve posted those reviews, otherwise I never would&#x27;ve figured out what was causing the the dramatic increase in both the frequency and severity of the migraines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Wen is an awesome product, but if you&#x27;re prone to getting headaches or Migraines, try another scent.</li>
    <li> works great &amp; smells very good.</li>
    <li> I like the performance of it, but not a fan of the fragrance.  Prefer the almond mint.</li>
    <li> I love WEN, best hair product. Received in a timely manner</li>
    <li> I have tried, perhaps five different Wen Cleansing Conditioners.  Some have been wonderful, and there were one or two which didn&#x27;t really seem to work as well with my hair.  I was almost going to abandon Wen entirely because I felt like maybe it wasn&#x27;t working anymore.  My hair was feeling flatter and almost greasy.  I thought I would try this one seasonal Ginger Pumpkin &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; first though.  I cannot get over how wonderful it has been for my hair.  It feels much thicker and &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; if that makes sense.  I don&#x27;t have to wash it as often as I did with the other Wen Cleansers.  I can get an extra day or two.  I wash now every three to four days.  It feels thick and shiny and responds great now to my curling iron and ceramic rollers.  I was so worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it that I ordered enough to last me for months.  Love Wen and in particular I love this Ginger Pumpkin one.</li>
    <li> I used every alternative thinkable and now just have a ton of product laying around! It Is offical i have sworn off poser products - OMG it has happened to me - I am a WEN girl !</li>
    <li> It smells nice and my hair feels nice but the amount you have to use makes it seriously expensive. Not sure it is wonderful enough to pay that much.</li>
    <li> I like it very much - thrilled not needing to apply separate conditioner.</li>
    <li> Smells great works great love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I went back and forth between giving 2 or 3 stars.  If you&#x27;ve never used WEN products, ignore this review, because WEN cleansing conditioners are THE best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.  My review is specifically about this formula in comparison to the other WEN formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pumpkin formula did nothing special for my hair.  It didn&#x27;t dry it out as bad as the Lavender, and it didn&#x27;t make it quite as oily as the Mango Coconut (which I can&#x27;t find anymore on Amazon :(...).  I found it to be so so on performance, but definitely not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nothing like pumpkin.  One time after my toddler had been running around and got all sweaty, his head resembled a pumpkin smell, but that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;ve used almost the entire bottle, and I have never noticed anything that resembles pumpkin.  It smells like a holiday version of Noxema face cleanser (if there we&#x27;re such a thing).  There&#x27;s a cinnamon hint to it, but it just smells sort of strange.  I enjoyed the WEN \\&quot;six Thirteen\\&quot; scent the best.  I was a little perplexed by the great reviews.  Maybe a lot of people that try WEN for the first time purchase this scent.  I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> The wide portion of the pump will not fit inside the bottle. It is not the correct size and cannot be used.</li>
    <li> I love Wen products, my favorite is the sweet almond but i thought I would try the Ginger, it works beautifully.  I have very thick wavy hair about shoulder length.  When I blow out my hair it has tendency to frizz but using Wen eliminates the frizz and my hair feels so amazing!</li>
