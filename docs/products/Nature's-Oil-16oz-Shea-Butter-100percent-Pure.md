      <li>I will definitely recommend this product to my family and friends or better yet when they have a problem I&#x27;ll get my jar and say trry this, lol.</li>
      <li>Found out that if I put an ounce in the microwave for about 5 seconds and then stir with a wodden paddle it softens up just fine.  </li>
      <li>Mine is smooth throughout.  </li>
      <li>Tried mixing some with a handcream but the result wasn&#x27;t as good as just keeping the 100% stuff soft.</li>
      <li>The container was great and full of Shea butter I would get it again if it came in a really really big size</li>
      <li>Great for dry cracked hands in the winter.</li>
      <li>It is great for dry, ashy skin!!</li>
      <li>This was highly recommended by many people to saturate my hair with and cover with a shower cap for the night.  </li>
      <li>Good value $/ must be willing to melt and mix to make daily use product.</li>
      <li>I have great trouble with &amp;#34;freeze</li>
      <li>Love these natural skin and hair care items.</li>
      <li>price is right too.</li>
      <li>As I wrote in my previous review of the coconut product, this product is  simply the best when it comes to price.</li>
      <li>It is too early to give an honest complete review.</li>
      <li>Love love raw Sheabutter  </li>
      <li>The Shea butter is hard- smells great, but if you are not a pro, prepare to use some elbow greese to work this.</li>
      <li>This will be my first time using this product.</li>
      <li>WELL THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USE,,,</li>
      <li>use it everyday &amp; a good price</li>
      <li>Final product is awesome to lube on at night to transform those stubborn dry, irritated, itchy skin patches from daily abuse or eczema.</li>
      <li>Love this shea butter, good quality and does not smell weird.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the way the pure unrefined shea butter smells.</li>
      <li>i love this its creamy smooth and not grainy which is hard to find when i got it</li>
      <li>Comes very hardened and odorless.</li>
      <li>This is very matte and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>but if your into the whole melting, put in the fridge, then whip method this is for you (or just using or if the container).</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very moisturizing and helps me out when i need to make lipstick with it.</li>
      <li>Not an all natural recipe but a economical product for those with sore skin.</li>
      <li>you cannot use it straight from the jar.  </li>
      <li>My husband needs this for very dry skin and it should be easy to use</li>
      <li>I 1/2 filled empty containers with product then added some oils for scent and Vaseline.</li>
      <li>Has no smell, which is the sign of either highly processed shea butter or really old shea butter.</li>
      <li>I had some of the unrefined type and it was gritty with a funny smell.</li>
      <li>This cream is easy to apply which is an advantage over the raw butter.</li>
      <li>Skin is so soft and no reaction like I have to Coco Butter.</li>
      <li>Have to stir it about every 3-4 days to keep it soft.  </li>
      <li>I, even now as an adult suffer from cradle cap which my doctor basically said is just a glorified term for dandruff for infants.  </li>
      <li>While at school I need something really soft because I can&#x27;t melt the Shea butter before whipping so next time I will save this for a visit home instead of melting with a blow dryer....</li>
      <li>it makes a great base for natural cosmetic products.  </li>
      <li>This product is completely all natural and very healing for dry hands, itching irritations, and other minor skin irritations.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use it daily.... Love the product.</li>
    <li> I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Hard, refined shea butter... just what I wanted.  Basically scentless and colorless (white)... it makes a great base for natural cosmetic products.  Mine was not grainy as can happen when it is melted and then rapidly cooled.  Mine is smooth throughout.  Keep in mind that this won&#x27;t have scent or color as it is a refined version of Shea Butter.  The unrefined/raw shea will be yellowish with a stronger odor.</li>
    <li> It is too early to give an honest complete review. This will be my first time using this product. I will give you better details after I;ve used this product in time.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of Shea Butter!</li>
    <li> Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It was wonderful and amazon deleted it in a tomely manner too</li>
    <li> i love this its creamy smooth and not grainy which is hard to find when i got it i didnt even want to warm it to add oilss thats how creamy this is will stock up just to have more in storage great company to stick with for life</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hubby and I put this all over our bodies and faces before bed. The hubby has oily skin but when he puts the butter on his face; his skin does not shine. This is very matte and non-greasy. And it does not stink like the unrefined version. I love that it has no smell. I used to use unrefined cocoa butter and my husband used to complain all the time. GREAT butter!</li>
    <li> Has no smell, which is the sign of either highly processed shea butter or really old shea butter. I like this seller&#x27;s other products, but this shea butter is terrible.</li>
    <li> As I wrote in my previous review of the coconut product, this product is  simply the best when it comes to price. $7.00 for 16oz. compared to $14.00 for 1.6 oz. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the 1.6 oz product that has a few oils added. This product is completely all natural and very healing for dry hands, itching irritations, and other minor skin irritations. Please buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and started using this stuff a few months ago. It is a little grainy but does thejob.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right too.</li>
    <li> Good value $/ must be willing to melt and mix to make daily use product. Nice value for the quality. Comes very hardened and odorless.I melted mine in container by placing it in water brought to a low simmer. I 1/2 filled empty containers with product then added some oils for scent and Vaseline. I sometimes add jojoba,coconut or Argon oils. Final product is awesome to lube on at night to transform those stubborn dry, irritated, itchy skin patches from daily abuse or eczema. Not an all natural recipe but a economical product for those with sore skin.</li>
    <li> I, even now as an adult suffer from cradle cap which my doctor basically said is just a glorified term for dandruff for infants.  This was highly recommended by many people to saturate my hair with and cover with a shower cap for the night.  It took probably two hours to saturate my air and get it capped.  However after about probably I&#x27;d say 30 minutes I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell anymore and I had to wash it out.  Keep in mind this is an OIL based product; so I had to wash my hair I believe 3 or 4 times to get all of the product out then condition it 4 times then put on a 3 minute mask as well as leave in conditioner.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for amateurs like myself.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel after an afternoon swim, morning shower or after work bath.  This is the best!</li>
    <li> I use this often alone or mixed with coconut oil...great for hair, lips and skin.</li>
    <li> I can not tolerate the smell of unrefined shea butter so I was looking for some that was refined but couldn&#x27;t locate any on the ground.  Gave this brand a try and could not be happier.  It was easy for me to work with, my natural hair loves it and best of all, no stinky smell!  My only issue was that I was sent a 14oz container rather than the 16oz container.  I&#x27;m not sure if this was a mistake or if the company is downsizing the product.  I decided to keep it rather than send it back--yes, I was that desperate, LOL--but this might be something to consider when ordering and receiving this product.</li>
    <li> great product, will order again</li>
    <li> I REALLY ENJOY MY SHEA BUTTER!  THANK YOU AMAZON!!</li>
    <li> Love love raw Sheabutter  This cream is easy to apply which is an advantage over the raw butter. My husband needs this for very dry skin and it should be easy to use</li>
    <li> I never order enough of this. I melt cocoa and shea together and cover every inch of my body with it.. Ooooh..... Does that feel fabuous! And smells fabulous, to! Shea is really good for scars. I was in a bad car accident and have a lot of scars. Shea also protects all exposed skin from the sun. I&#x27;m in Florida and I SWEAR it WORKS!! Just keep reapplying.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing with any marks of cuts on my hands after 2 applications they are almost gone! Great for dry cracked hands in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on face after I use my NONO.  An article I read advised using the shea butter to retard hair growth.  Need to use longer to see if it actually helps; but my skin is softer.</li>
    <li> it was hard and grainy....you cannot use it straight from the jar.  I melted it and mixed it with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Great deal on Shea butter. I had some of the unrefined type and it was gritty with a funny smell. This Shea Butter is white and dense but creamy with no smell. I&#x27;m on my second tub...love!!</li>
    <li> Good price, fast shipping very happy. Will order again.</li>
    <li> use this shea for grand children who don&#x27;t like the unrefined shea that has a strong nut smell</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter, good quality and does not smell weird. I used for soap, lotions and chap stick. Now using it solo for stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter. I don&#x27;t care for the way the pure unrefined shea butter smells. This is great in all my home made body butters and lotions.</li>
    <li> Love this! I use it in lotions and alone....great healthcare will buy again</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very moisturizing and helps me out when i need to make lipstick with it. The feel of the product is very pleasant and perfect for really dry skin.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Had to go on line to find directions for turning the (nearly dry) butter into a usable product.  Found out that if I put an ounce in the microwave for about 5 seconds and then stir with a wodden paddle it softens up just fine.  Have to stir it about every 3-4 days to keep it soft.  I keep the usable portion in a small screw-top container.  I have great trouble with &amp;#34;freeze cracks&amp;#34; at the corners of my finger nails and haven&#x27;t had a problem since I began using this stuff.  You use so little, this will probably last a couple of years... maybe longer.  Tried mixing some with a handcream but the result wasn&#x27;t as good as just keeping the 100% stuff soft.</li>
    <li> Just love this product will order again and the price is great also</li>
    <li> The container was great and full of Shea butter I would get it again if it came in a really really big size ( I try to purchase in bulk this is like a personal sized). While at school I need something really soft because I can&#x27;t melt the Shea butter before whipping so next time I will save this for a visit home instead of melting with a blow dryer.... Don&#x27;t judge me. With that being said if your looking for a softer grade find something else but if your into the whole melting, put in the fridge, then whip method this is for you (or just using or if the container).</li>
    <li> use it everyday &amp; a good price</li>
    <li> Love it. Skin is so soft and no reaction like I have to Coco Butter.</li>
    <li> As I said, I love this company! Great costumer service, great products! I am very pleased about my relationship with this company but want to share, an honest product review. This particular product a little hard to work with... The Shea butter is hard- smells great, but if you are not a pro, prepare to use some elbow greese to work this. I would recomend to novice soap makers to buy their oils. As I said, I think that this company is awesome, but note you have to \\&quot;work\\&quot; this particular product to make it work for soap making needs. :)They have been a pleasure to deal with in my experience, so... that&#x27;s my input! People that also try to make and sell soap, feel free to inform me of you input!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used shea butter before but always put it on the shelf.  I decided to try it again and I love this brand.  Mixing this with the argan oil from the same seller is really nice!!  Love these natural skin and hair care items.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars. I was so dry this winter that even coconut oil woildn&#x27;t help. My hands and arms were dry, flaky and itchy. I have used products with shea butter in the past and thought what the heck let&#x27;s give it a go. This product is amazing! After two days there was a noticable diffrence, after about a week no more dry flaky itchy skin. I am now incorporating it into some lotion concoctions I am playing with and it is wonderful. I will definitely recommend this product to my family and friends or better yet when they have a problem I&#x27;ll get my jar and say trry this, lol.</li>
    <li> WELL THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USE,,,</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! It is great for dry, ashy skin!! It does wonders for my skin!!</li>
</ol>
