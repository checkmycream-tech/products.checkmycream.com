      <li>Great price, fast delivery, great product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used it for years and love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and I love it!  It feels a bit greasy when you first apply it but that goes away after a bit.  At the end of the day my skin feels soft and moisturized but doesn&#x27;t look shiny or greasy.  I&#x27;m buying this again.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  We love it!  It makes my skin feel great and it smells good.  I love that there is not a greesy feel after applying it</li>
    <li> Great Product! Sunscreen and moisturizer in one!</li>
    <li> Best skin care ever!!</li>
    <li> Product is amazing but packaging horrible. Lotion is not heavy so works great under make up. My skin is soft and protected. The packaging for image products in past year changed in a bad way. I left this lotion on my makeup tray only to find the lid is defective so 1/4 of the lotion was wasted. I&#x27;ve now replaced their lid with one from another item I have. I give it 3 stars only because I like the lotion. I am contacting the manufacturer today about getting replacement.</li>
    <li> Best ever moisturizer and SPF combined.  Not heavy but does the job!!!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a year great alone or under make. Great oil control.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer makes my skin feel good from the inside out!</li>
    <li> I looked up Image Skin Care on amazon because at the spa where I go for microdermabrasion, this is one of the product lines they use. I stumbled upon this one and decided to order to give it a try. My first impressions: 1) it&#x27;s light, 2) it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen and the scent disappears quickly, and 3) it goes on pretty sheer. It seemed to keep my oil under control, though I do have oily skin. I don&#x27;t wear makeup or powder, and the shine seemed controlled. I&#x27;ll update my review after a few weeks use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now but with this most recent purchase, the formula did not make my skin as matte and it did before and the oily skin of my is appearing quite sooner than it used to.  Also, the new smell reminds me of the original flavor bubble gum.  I&#x27;m not sure if i like that.  It still a good product overall, but just not as great as it used to be.</li>
    <li> This is the best matte moisturizer for oily skin I have found!  It really works, is non-greasy and sets makeup nicely.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is one of the authentic Image Skincare moisturizers that I am used to. I still have more than half remaining in my previous container that I purchased from my &amp;#34;skin guy.&amp;#34; The scent in this bottle is stronger and fruitier than what I am accustomed to. Moreover, the design of the container is different. I am afraid to put it on my skin because I do not want any adverse reactions. I think I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> I usually use the regular 50spf one but i noticed there was one for oily skin so thought I&#x27;d try it. I do have very oily skin. It&#x27;s funny, but I think the regular actually keeps me slightly more matte. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle, but then switch back.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with any image product</li>
    <li> Seems like no matter what I put on my face, my make up melts away before lunch time! This stuff keeps my face fresh all day long, even with my horribly oily skin!</li>
    <li> Best oil control sunscreen I have tried.  It keeps my face matte all day long.  I am impressed and will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> i love this moisturizer.  I was introduced to it at a spa when i got a facial.  It is the best for my oily skin.  Cost way less on amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great! Nice to everyday use in the warmer months.</li>
    <li> Great product quick delivery</li>
    <li> I love this product. Skin feels great &amp; its smooth &amp; sinks into the skin really well. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Really worked well and smells great.  I was out in the sun for over 5 hours and didn&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>
    <li> Image Prevention and Daily Matt Moisturizer is so amazing! I have oily skin and I have never found a product that could moisturize without making my face extra greasy...well, not only does this product NOT make my face greasy but it actually moisturizes while absorbing the oil. I put it on in the morning and go the entire day without even needing to reapply powder, I truly get a matte look all day. So as I said...AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I found this product originally through my facialist - it&#x27;s great. Makes wearing sunscreen every day easy! I use this as a primer for my makeup as well, it helps keep everything set throughout the day. Seller got this to me incredibly quickly, and everything was as described. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is great for acne treatment.  I will use it as long as I need it.  I like that it was SPF 32.3 as I know lots of my friends never wear protection on their faces and know how important protection is.</li>
    <li> I was really trying to decide between this sunscreen and the dermalogica matte sunscreen but decided to go with this one and im happy I did. I have very oily skin- after washing my face, it gets dry for about an hour then gets super oily. I wear makeup almost everyday and used milk of magnesia (yes the laxative!) as a primer which was amaaaazing at controlling oil unlike those brand name primers that Ive tried like MAC, Smashbox, etc. 8 hrs later and my makeup would still look great. unfortunately, I recently found out milk of magnesia is NOT good to put on your face so I had  to find another product. Thankfully, this image matte sunscreen works as a moisturizer, sunscreen AND primer for me. Doesnt work as well as milk of magnesia but itll do for now. My nose and chin still gets oily but not as much and not as fast! it does have a slight scent, but unless you have a sensitive nose, it shouldn&#x27;t bother you. i plan on trying the dermalogica matte sunscreen just to see if that one is any better. Either way, this product is great and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now.  I am a light-skinned with redness and post acne marks on my face.  I would apply this product after cleansing and drying my face completely.  The product is a little thick to apply and my face would be shiny after each application due to the wetness.  After letting it completely dry, my face was still very shiny as if I had just applied it.  I confirmed with Image Skincare that this moisturizer is &amp;#34;formulated to leave a Matte finish on the skin free of excess oil and shine.&amp;#34;  Unfortunately, it left my face shiny as can be.  Maybe I received a defective bottle or my skin is too oily for this product to work.  I was previously using Kiehl&#x27;s Blue Herbal Moisturizer, which left my face glowing and shine-free. However, the Blue Herbal Moisturizer contains SA, which I no longer need in my moisturizers.  I was hoping this product would work because I love the ingredients and the SPF.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Have been using for a few years now and plane to continue.</li>
    <li> No white residue. Moisturizing</li>
    <li> This lotion is quite thick and sticky, but fits the bill for what I use it for.  I use it in conjunction with a 50% lactic acid chemical peel weekly (after the peel).  It provides the hydration and sun protection needed if you are subjecting your skin to a peel regulary.  Can use for the next couple of days after the peel if skin is feeling sensitive.  I cannot use it daily, as I feel it is more than what my skin needs day to day.  I have normal skin type with some oil in the chin area.  Somewhat expensive, though, thus the 4 star instead of 5.</li>
    <li> I tried this product at the advice of a woman giving me a facial - and I love it!  I live at altitude, so I worry about long-term sun damage, and this product alleviates some of my worry because I can use it every day and not have my face break out.  It feels very light and makes my skin look fresh and glow.  Highly recommend.  I don&#x27;t notice the smell that other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. Not greasy. Just right. Skin truly feels matte and balanced. Maintains my skin the entire day and into the evening.</li>
    <li> Do not buy Smashbox primer, Benefit primer, or any other $40+ makeup base/ primer ever again! This is the best primer I have used and smells good too. I have dry/ combination skin and is the perfect base for my makeup.</li>
    <li> Amazing, non-oily for no matter how long u wear it, my everyday product for no matter what the season is, great as just a moisturizer also</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell!! Works well, not too sticky and not too thick. Would definitely buy again and would recommend!</li>
    <li> to note, I didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon, I bought direct from my esthetician at her salon.  and I never used the &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to get my oily skin routine down for quite some time and finally found the biggest missing piece - this moisturizer.  I notice such a HUGE difference from when I wear it and not wear it.  it is a bit thick bc it is sunscreen as well, but it rubs in nicely with no white residue.</li>
    <li> Smells great, seems to protect me from the sun. It is white, but goes on smoothly and you don&#x27;t need to rub it in.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time...love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and smells so nice.</li>
    <li> Absolutely always love this product but ordered from Beauty Perfect and it was shipped very poorly for being a premium skin care product. Came in with the box squished, torn, and product smashed open.</li>
    <li> This order came SUPER fast and it is excactly as described. I have been using this moisturizer for a while and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonder product to use every day. Great for women who want to wear moisturizer that is not heavy but with a high SPF.</li>
    <li> Not as good at preventing oiliness as the other matte moisturizer as one I&#x27;ve gotten from Image in the past - I&#x27;m not sure if this is a new version and the other one I used to get was discontinued, or if I just picked the wrong item. I thought it was the same thing based on the name just new packaging, but the lotion is very different. It&#x27;s much thicker and does not keep me Matte nearly as well as the other one. :(</li>
    <li> Use this under makeup all the time. Such a HG product for me. So happy its available  on here! Can&#x27;t buy it near my location.</li>
    <li> Light scent fades quickly, Light Moisturizing w/ Matte Finish that doesn&#x27;t clog pores, feels like you&#x27;re wearing nothing, No allergic reactions, No White Cast, Smooths on easily without crumbling/pilling on face. I only use this one because it really works for me.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and this moisturizer has been a life saver. My t-zone is much more manageable and it also works well with my makeup.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the only daily lotion I put on my face.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I use it everyday, its very light, no odor, and no greasy like most other sunscreen. I would purchase again</li>
    <li> The older version of this matte moisturizer did the trick -- It prevented oily skin through the day and kept my makeup in tact. This one makes my make up bleed and I have to continuously blot my T-zone to avoid &amp;#34;Shiny face.&amp;#34; What the hell, IMAGE? Get it together! Bring back the older version!!! PLEEEEASE!!!</li>
    <li> The old formula (Daily Defense) was the best! I had been using it for 3+ years. It made my skin so matte and reduced the redness and didn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I was running out of it and needed more so just recently got this one thinking it was a new package design. WRONG! The formula is different, it does not have 18% Zinc Oxide. It is silky but thick like glue and smells strong like bubblegum. Makes my skin look shiny after putting it on, nothing matte about it. I hate it. I want the old one back. Now I will be looking for a new product/vendor. Please Image Skin Care take these reviews into consideration and bring the old one back! (Nigel&#x27;s Wife)</li>
    <li> This product has been a staple of mine for several years at the advice of a local technician at a higher end med spa.  Coverage is lightweight and serves as a nice backdrop for makeup application.  The formula seems to help control my oil shine in humid summer months and the integration of SPF sunscreen makes this a home run.  I have sensitive skin and have not experienced any breakouts.  Consistency is a bit runny but a little goes a long way.  Size of tube makes it easy to pack on airline carry-on in 3-3-3 quart bag.  Best of all, price is 50% less on Amazon v. Retail price at med spa!</li>
    <li> Awesome! real deal not a fake.</li>
    <li> I have very oily/shiny skin and this moisturizer has SAVED MY LIFE. It may seem dramatic, but when you normally have to blot your skin all day long and reapply makeup throughout the day to cover your shine, you&#x27;ll pay anything to find a solution...to discover a product that creates a matte finish with no blotting or reapplying of makeup necessary (and I&#x27;m talking 7am-10pm without ANY shine), it is simply amazing! I just wish I had discovered it sooner!</li>
    <li> Excellent amazon seller. Item new as described. Fast post to Sydney, Australia. Thank you</li>
    <li> I feel like this product does a great job of moisturizing and providing protection from the sun. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one protects my face from burning better than the others. And it smells good!</li>
    <li> A little too heavy for my skin, but smells amazing and is a great sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I usually break out with new products, but this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all. The first time I used this product I put too much on and hated it because it made my makeup look like it was sliding off. The next time I used much less and just rubbed it in better then waited a bit before putting on my makeup and it worked great. Since it is a mineral sunscreen it can make skin look like it has a white film on it, but because I am so light skinned it blends in well. My boyfriend, however, has to really rub it in and make sure he doesn&#x27;t use too much or it is noticeable. Also, he has oily skin and this product has worked great for him. Most sunscreens (even mineral) make him appear more oily. I love this product because it works for both of us and looks great under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this has is a oil free matte lotion. I think it really helps with controlling my face from getting oiler, but I could care less about the cherry type smell of it. It&#x27;s kinda gross :(</li>
    <li> I like this matte moisturizer.  It leaves my skin well moisturized and I don&#x27;t find it dry at all.  I like the 30 SPF since I live in TX and I am outside a lot.  I hope it keeps the shine on my face that develops during the day down,</li>
    <li> It smells good. Other than that it wasn&#x27;t anything special. I didn&#x27;t notice any benefit from using this particular moisturizer versus a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Smells great. I love everything about the image line. Does not feel cakey either.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and company been using this for over a year. I have oily skin so the matte really helps with oil control</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has made a big difference with my oily skin!! I am so grateful to the positive reviews I read about this product before purchasing it they really helped me make my mind up seeing what a difference this product made for others.  I am only on my second day of using this product but I see such a huge improvement I had to write a review.  I want to tell everyone about this product , if you have oily skin and enlarged pores this is the product for you! I am really happy that i made this purchase I want to try other products from this line! AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product for a face cream to moisturize my skin. I use in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It feels good on and does not turn oily. I got my friend to use it and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I had this Daily Matte Moisturizer in the past. It is perfect for combination skin type. Love the results.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen. Its works well. You can use your normal makeup over it and it does not look shiny and it does not feel sticky. I just order another one.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery, great product</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer  ever!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  The person who I get facials from suggested this and I thought I might try it. From the first time, I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Bought the second and added in another piece (the Resurfacing Masque).  I was sold on Image.  Great transaction!</li>
    <li> Great product love it shipping was great anyone with dry skin this is the best to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using three Image products now (two for several years) and I love them all. The consistency is creamy and the scent light and fresh.</li>
    <li> Great. Smells like bananas.</li>
    <li> Just seems like any average sunscreen, hasn&#x27;t helped with my oil control.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for and it was delivered early.  That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> My favorite day cream. I have repurchased twice. Its not greasy and does a great job of moisturizing and protecting from the sun, all while staying matte!</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve used for over 3 years! Love it &amp; recommend it!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> The old formula was better. the smell is not as good as the other and the texture is also sticky but it still works the same</li>
    <li> This face lotion smells absolutely wonderful!  It applies and covers smooth and easy.  A little drop goes a long, long way.  Worth the price.  I might try the hydration version just to see the difference between that and the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;.  although my face doesn&#x27;t feely oily after application, and I have combination skin, but mostly dry, my face doesn&#x27;t look like it has a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; look after application.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy and it also offers good sun protection.</li>
    <li> Have used for years.  Like the matte finish and SPF.  Also, good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and it smells nice. It actually disappears into my skin and it does not make my skin greasy or oily. It is lightweight and it has a smooth consistency which is another reason why I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s affordable and has a sunscreen plus keeps my face young and soft looking.  Helps to even out blemishes and everyone is always saying to me how young I look and how my skin glows ever since I started using this product which has been about 8 months now.</li>
    <li> Love the way it applies but HATE the scent. I am so disappointed this is scented. I realize many might not mind the strong scent, but I hate it. It bothers me, and because it does, I will not buy this product anymore. I personally find the scent strong and unpleasant. Oh, and the scent lingers a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way the product blends matte and oil-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an unscented facial sunscreen, as I do, this product is not for you. If you want a scented sunscreen that is oil-free and matte, you probably will like this.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this moisturizer for 1 year and I love the smell, the texture and that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or too dry. Make up goes over the moisturizer great!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. The scent is very pleasant too</li>
    <li> Box was slightly damaged upon delivery, but product itself as expected.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love! I was given a facial at a spa where this product was used. It has excellent sun protection, and feels amazing.  I will buy it again, and again.</li>
    <li> I love this Daily Matte Moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have problems with acne until I was in my late 20&#x27;s.  It continued into my mid 30&#x27;s.  Not just pimples.  Those HUGE, cystic pimples that actually hurt and would last for weeks.  And the only place I broke out was my chin.  It was humiliating.  It got a little better as I got into my late 30&#x27;s but my chin would still break out in the small, under the skin type pimples.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and have seen an improvement in my skin.  I will continue to use this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> No happy with this product. Loved the old version the daily defense, now they call it prevention +. I was expecting the same great product that left no oil on my face and was very disappointed,  literally feels oily when applying itand the smell is uunappealing as well. Supposed to smell better I guess but reminds of bubble gum or something.</li>
    <li> I have only recently discovered this moisturizer in the last year.  I wish I had discovered it 15 years ago!!  I&#x27;ve always dealt with oily skin and it got to the point where I stopped wearing moisturizer because I thought it helped keep the oil away from my face.  To give you an idea, I would use 5 blotting sheets a day just to keep some of the shine off my face.  I didn&#x27;t to blot with powder because it would look too caked on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since using this product, I don&#x27;t even touch my blotting sheets but maybe one a week if it&#x27;s really humid outside.  When first applying, I thought my skin would be oily instantly, but it somehow keeps the oil at bay.  I have sensitive skin and my rosacea has gotten so much better from this product.  I recommend this to anyone with oily skin.</li>
    <li> did a facial and massage she referred this product. only to know it was full of chemicals</li>
    <li> Great product use it every day</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Image&amp;#34; products are just right for my skin. I am a senior now, and as I get older the usual off the shelf items don&#x27;t seem to do as much. This moisture/sun block item is perfect. It isn&#x27;t too heavy, but gives good sun protection and moisturizes nicely.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer gets every thing I need! It leaves a matte finish on my skin so its no longer &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; during the day :) I&#x27;m also impressed by the SPF and oil free features. LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell. Can&#x27;t be happier with this product. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. Was worried it would not be authentic or expired, but it was not.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It is one of the few honest products I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon. It&#x27;s true to its word. I have very oily skin that is mainly caused by my scalp. I heard having from my scalp helps a lot for my hair but definitely not for my face. It breaks me out so when I first started using this my break outs lessened. This stuff does leave a sticky feeling but something to be worried about. It&#x27;s great for sun protection and keeping your face normal and not shiny in daylight. I don&#x27;t use makeup at all but I use a finishing powder that gets rid of that oil from the face so I use this powder right after I put on this sunscreen and matte moisturiser. Also I recommend not putting any moisturiser before the sunscreen because it kind of defeats the purpose of it, and it also peels off the sunscreen if you put it on after. So yeah, just a heads up for that. Overall, this is staying in my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Best daytime sun care product I have ever used! I have been using it for 2 years now.  I have very, very oily skin.  It does not break out my skin, irritate it and it controls my oil very well in the summer.  I would recommend (and I do) this to anyone.</li>
