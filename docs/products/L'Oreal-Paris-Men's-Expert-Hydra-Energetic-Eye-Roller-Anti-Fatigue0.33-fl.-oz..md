      <li>and my skin feels and looks good,</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, it doesn&#x27;t tell you how often or how many times you should roll/apply it!</li>
      <li>Awesome pruduct for the price!&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
      <li>I have used for about 3 weeks and honestly cannot tell any difference in the puffiness or darkness under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>The product is excellent, I really recommend this item.</li>
      <li>fast ship and the product was send  in perfect conditions.</li>
      <li>but I need to be honest...</li>
      <li>This item is very good at reducing the puffiness around my eyes, it is  moderately good at reducing the darkness, but it there is still marked improvement.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to roll on and has an immediate cooling sensation.</li>
      <li>the cooling sensation feels mighty good on the under eye however this does not amount to the fact that all it does is simle</li>
      <li>Works great on my tired under eye pokers in the morning after 10 minutes puffiness goes away and I look great very good product...</li>
      <li>this just feels so good and cool.</li>
      <li>I gave the product three stars, because I have been using it for more than a month</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just ok for me.  </li>
      <li>I have also tried Nivea&#x27;s version of the eye roller and will say the loreal product is better than the Nivea</li>
      <li>i really love it.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t has magic</li>
      <li>Buy something better.</li>
      <li>, does the purpose as it states it is a energetic roller</li>
      <li>but well I didn&#x27;t read well how many ml was</li>
      <li>, it always makes me satisfied,</li>
      <li>Perhaps others may have a better experience.</li>
      <li>If you want a noticeable change i&#x27;d suggest you  go buy a woman&#x27;s product with some quality ingredient, or something with better reviews.</li>
      <li>ostensibly I should just get more sleep, but had hoped that would mask the lack</li>
      <li>Love this, use it night and day.  </li>
      <li>but in the end I&#x27;m just lost on how to get the most out of it.</li>
      <li>It was ok, I used it for a while</li>
      <li>just moreso refreshing is a better way to put it.</li>
      <li>he likes how refreshing it feels in the morning when he uses it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I kept it.</li>
      <li>I cant see nothing better in his face.</li>
      <li>i would not recomend this product because there is simply better products out there</li>
      <li>Ok for the price</li>
      <li>Perhaps others may have a better experience.</li>
      <li>Oh, sure, it took an hour or two before I could see results</li>
      <li>It first of all does feel good when applying it</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Men&#x27;s line and love most of their products.  </li>
      <li>The rollerball glides under your eyes easily and the liquid is soothing and refreshing</li>
      <li>Comments such as, \\&quot;Get a good night&#x27;s sleep?\\&quot; or \\&quot;You&#x27;re looking good today\\&quot; are the sort that don&#x27;t just suggest, but tell you the product works.</li>
      <li>If you want better results in this respect, an eye cream would probably be better, though this product is pretty good for a quick and indiscreet touch-up when you&#x27;ve woken up.</li>
      <li>It feels good when you apply, but does it really make a difference is yet to be determined.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to carry.  </li>
      <li>It feels really nice when you apply this product: cool and calm around your eyes.</li>
      <li>I guess it soothes the shadows under your eyes a little bit, but nothing that will make it perfect.</li>
      <li>Are men&#x27;s eyes different then woman&#x27;s lol.</li>
      <li>Great product, thought size was bigger</li>
      <li>It certainly feels nice and cool going on</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good if you get up super early for work etc.    </li>
      <li>I will continue to use and update my review if I notice any significant improvements.</li>
      <li>i was totatly and completely right!</li>
      <li>I liked the product but there are a few more things on the market that seem like they work a litter better.</li>
      <li>It takes sometime to work but, over time it does what is intended to do, not drastically but good enough.</li>
      <li>applied, it&#x27;s a ice cool tingling feeling.</li>
      <li>This painless and smooth roller has shown results in the first week.</li>
      <li>Have not conducted a full on test to see how effective it actually is (hence the 4 stars)</li>
      <li>The ClarinsMen serum does work the best of these three on the baggy areas/minor swelling under my eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the black.</li>
      <li>For the price, this is a great item to keep in the car or office when you need a little eye rejuvenation.</li>
      <li>The coolant feels nice on my skin, but it left a wierd film under my eyes when i wore it to bed.</li>
      <li>I have no further info on how he liked it.</li>
      <li>It feels nice going on, and there seems to be a slight lessening of the dark circles, but my eyes are still fairly puffy most of the morning.</li>
      <li>I felt the difference right away.</li>
      <li>What you get is essentially a clear fluid, and it works fairly well at eliminating puffiness of the eyes that you get when you are sleep deprived.</li>
      <li>so will help you with the thought mornings (or moments during the day), will continue to use to see more results, definitely recommended and it is worth the price.</li>
      <li>If it had instructions on how to properly apply it, I think I would have better results.</li>
      <li>; spell, relieves the swollen under eye area pretty well</li>
      <li>I am sure it is the same thing.</li>
      <li>At first I did not think it was doing a thing.  </li>
      <li>To be fair i do not use this product everyday.</li>
      <li>I think the higher cost of a doctors visit would be more worth the money and time spent than these over the counter treatments.</li>
      <li>I think the important thing to remember is that if you have seriously huge dark bags under your eyes, no amount of anything is going to help except for surgery or maybe some creams that cost hundreds of dollars.</li>
      <li>and if you like the roll-on because it is easy and simple to apply.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually making them go away for good, or if it&#x27;s just temporary for as long as I use it.    </li>
      <li>This product does work, to a certain extent.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t feel comfortable recommending this to someone who has significant bagginess or dark circles and crows feet around the eye area.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are a ton of eye creams on the market, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve found that is made specifically for men, and has produced results that meet my managed expectations, so I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Really wanted to like this product, but couldn&#x27;t really tell much of a difference.</li>
      <li>so i wasnt really expecting it to work too wel, and</li>
      <li>Really really helps with puffy eyes in the morning.</li>
      <li>So it didn&#x27;t really do what I wanted it to, but it did help in another way... 3 stars, 2 taken away for not doing what it claimed it would, but I will still use it for what it does do.</li>
      <li>But the roller-ball applicator doesn&#x27;t work well for me, often not depositing much of the liquid on my skin.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t really expect a miracle.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>this product didnt cost too much money</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much...</li>
      <li>They gave as much instruction to use this as a chap stick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t apply too much or it will crust up and look unsightly and unhygienic.</li>
      <li>So I ordered this product without much hype or hope, and I was correct.</li>
      <li>, I feel a very slight amount of tightening of the skin below my eyes if i use it abundantly</li>
      <li>I have had baggy eyes for many years and have tried other products including an ice mask.</li>
      <li>and I saw a little difference in the first week, but if you get the step 3 for this, it works even better when put together.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I gave the product three stars, because I have been using it for more than a month and I think it does not do much as to reducing the dark circles around the eyes. I called a pharmacist and he suggested to me to buy a creme rather than continuing to apply this eye roll product, and to use tea bags since they help to some extent.</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles and bags under my eyes for years. I&#x27;ve used tons of different eye creams or various other creams but my dark circles usually stayed.    I bought this on a whim just to see if it does make a difference. It&#x27;s a bit pricey though and definitely small.    It has a metallic ball and works like a pen. It&#x27;s super cold too. Getting up for university after a late night of studying or lack of sleep, it definitely opens your eyes up and brightens the area. It&#x27;s also good if you get up super early for work etc.    So far I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and I definitely notice that my eyes aren&#x27;t as dark anymore after I use it. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually making them go away for good, or if it&#x27;s just temporary for as long as I use it.    It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot to try it for yourself, especially if you have dark circles or bags or your eyes look tired from a lack of sleep.</li>
    <li> This product does work, to a certain extent. What you get is essentially a clear fluid, and it works fairly well at eliminating puffiness of the eyes that you get when you are sleep deprived. This is mostly due to the caffeine in the fluid which is scientifically known to reduce puffiness. BUT, the product only lightens the actual dark circle slightly, though the effect is noticeable. If you want better results in this respect, an eye cream would probably be better, though this product is pretty good for a quick and indiscreet touch-up when you&#x27;ve woken up.</li>
    <li> It was ok, I used it for a while but I didn&#x27;t see any improvement under my eyes.  SoI stop using it. It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to carry.  Very small tube with a metal bead roller.</li>
    <li> Well, yes, it feels good. So does splashing your face with cold water. I have been using this for weeks and can not tell any difference apart from the cooling effect when it goes on. Perhaps others may have a better experience. I can&#x27;t help but think the reviews are slightly skewed. You&#x27;ll notice most positive reviews are from people who have used the product for just a few days.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it works well at concealing the dark, puffy circles under my eyes.  The only thing I do not like about the product is that it isn&#x27;t the miracle cure I was hoping for - meaning it must be applied every morning to last through the day and the circles do reappear towards the end of the day in my experience.  I do not mind that as the results typically can get me through most of the day concealing the dark puffiness under my eyes though.</li>
    <li> I have genetically-inherited puffy circles under my eyes, and have unsuccessfully tried numerous products over the past ten years in order to get rid of them.  Short of bletharoplasty, I don&#x27;t think that there is any miracle cream out there that will completely and permanently get rid of under eye bags, but I have mixed feelings about the expense and risks of plastic surgery.  I&#x27;ve been using the eye roller about twice a day for a few weeks, and I can see more dramatic results than I have experienced with other creams and ointments in the past.  The metal roller immediately feels cold during application, and within a few minutes the clear fluid begins to tighten a little as it dries, giving my under eye areas a rejuvenated feeling (this is not an instant skin tightening cream, so don&#x27;t expect drastic tightening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few weeks of consistent use, I can see a faint difference in the coloration of my skin, and wrinkles in my under eye areas and crows feet are becoming finer.  Darker areas that were red/purple from capillary exposure are becoming more even toned with the rest of my facial skin, and although the roller pen won&#x27;t completely get rid of my circles, I think there is a subtle reduction in puffiness around both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a ton of eye creams on the market, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve found that is made specifically for men, and has produced results that meet my managed expectations, so I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, I really recommend this item. fast ship and the product was send  in perfect conditions. My rate for this product is a five star rate.</li>
    <li> this product didnt cost too much money so i wasnt really expecting it to work too wel, and i must say upon getting it and using it i was totatly and completely right! the cooling sensation feels mighty good on the under eye however this does not amount to the fact that all it does is simle make you undereyes cold and wet the darkness and puffyness does not go away.. i would not recomend this product because there is simply better products out there</li>
    <li> People are sayings its just a metal ball thats cold. Thats not true, there is a liquid that comes out when it is pressed against your skin. The product works well and I saw a little difference in the first week, but if you get the step 3 for this, it works even better when put together.</li>
    <li> To be fair i do not use this product everyday. I used this product twice a day for 3 weeks, before my wedding. The coolant feels nice on my skin, but it left a wierd film under my eyes when i wore it to bed. My puffiness did decrease in time for my wedding pictures, but do not expect miracles, even useing twice a day for 3 weeks, the puffiness did not disapear, So maybe you have to do it longer?&lt;br /&gt;What I did like was the price, even with shipping charges it was cheaper to buy this through this dealer than in a store.</li>
    <li> It feels nice when I put it under my eyes, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve noticed any change or improvement.</li>
    <li> ...wouldn&#x27;t seem an obvious target for this product. Indeed I bought it thinking, \\&quot;Oh, what the hell, if it works I&#x27;ll be surprized, if it doesn&#x27;t just chalk it up to being another victim of advertising hype. I wasn&#x27;t surprized, I was stunned. It worked. Oh, sure, it took an hour or two before I could see results but...others noticed before I did. Comments such as, \\&quot;Get a good night&#x27;s sleep?\\&quot; or \\&quot;You&#x27;re looking good today\\&quot; are the sort that don&#x27;t just suggest, but tell you the product works. Who cares if the ball applicator sticks on occasion? Who cares if it doesn&#x27;t come in a quart bottle, it works. It&#x27;s one simple product that says it will lessen the dark circles and tighten the bags-and the occasional wrinkle-and it does. It won&#x27;t cure a broken heart, flat feet or a bad hair day but for what it does, it does it quickly and well.</li>
    <li> Awesome pruduct for the price!&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help with the dark circles under my eyes like I had hoped, but it did reduce puffiness and make me look a little more awake in the early mornings.</li>
    <li> So I bought this because I have an ever changing shift at work (swing one day, in at 5am the next). I often had problems with dark circles under my eyes. I used this and I have to say it sort of works...  At least for me, after several weeks of use, I noticed no change in the circles under my eyes, which is part of what the product is intended to do (bummer..). However, it did something else. You know that feeling when you first wake up and your eyes have trouble staying open, even for hours? Well it gets rid of that feeling. It almost feels like caffeine for your eye balls. After a quick swipe, minutes later your eyes are open like you&#x27;ve just had your 5th latte of the day.  So it didn&#x27;t really do what I wanted it to, but it did help in another way... 3 stars, 2 taken away for not doing what it claimed it would, but I will still use it for what it does do.</li>
    <li> Good product, not great. Provide hydration and cooling effect on application. But does not reduce any lines or dark circles. Ok for the price and if you like the roll-on because it is easy and simple to apply.</li>
    <li> I felt the difference right away. I have had baggy eyes for many years and have tried other products including an ice mask. This painless and smooth roller has shown results in the first week. Try it you will be happy...</li>
    <li> Easy-to-use eyes aren&#x27;t as dark</li>
    <li> At first I did not think it was doing a thing.  Two weeks later it was disappeared from my luggage so I quit using it.  Quickly people noticed the difference and commented on me looking tired.  Purchased a couple this time to have a few spares around.</li>
    <li> Been using this every morning for about two months now, still have some left. It definitely lightens my dark circles and tightens the bags / reduces the puffiness. By no means does it make either go away 100%.  But it&#x27;s a definite improvement and it just takes a few moments to apply the clear solution, which dries invisible. Recommended to try.</li>
    <li> I have used for about 3 weeks and honestly cannot tell any difference in the puffiness or darkness under my eyes.  I am not sure that this product is anything but a hoax.</li>
    <li> Seems to help, but it is hard to say for sure. It feels good when you apply, but does it really make a difference is yet to be determined.</li>
    <li> This item is very good at reducing the puffiness around my eyes, it is  moderately good at reducing the darkness, but it there is still marked improvement. For the price, this is a great item to keep in the car or office when you need a little eye rejuvenation.</li>
    <li> It does lighten, but does not completely erase dark eye circles. It is a good product.</li>
    <li> I give it 3 stars just because the change is not as incredibly dramatic as L&#x27;Oreal makes it seem, but you get what you pay for. If you want dramatic changes, then flip open the phone book to the cosmetic surgeon section. The rollerball glides under your eyes easily and the liquid is soothing and refreshing but it takes a few minutes to dry. Don&#x27;t use too much because if you do it&#x27;ll run down your face. I did notice a bit of a difference but only in the colour of the dark circles. They didn&#x27;t seem as dark after using it a couple of times. The little eye bags I have  didn&#x27;t shrink much but I didn&#x27;t really expect a miracle. I think the important thing to remember is that if you have seriously huge dark bags under your eyes, no amount of anything is going to help except for surgery or maybe some creams that cost hundreds of dollars. If you just want something to perk you up a bit, then this stuff is great for that. I also think it&#x27;s good for getting men to start taking care of the skin around their eyes. Any bit of moisturizing you do will help prevent wrinkles, and this stuff does seem to provide some moisturizing function. Try it. It&#x27;s not a miracle or anything, but I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I recently moved to Miami and started getting into the dance club scene regulary sometimes staying out until after 2 am on week nights. I work an office job M-F starting at 9 am.  A co-worker friend told me I&#x27;ve been looking tired lately especially under the eyes. I decided to try this product because I saw a favorable review on it in Details magazine. From my experience of using this product for 2 weeks, it does not remove the puffiness or reduce the coloration under my eyes.  I had my buddy use it and he noticed no improvement with his eye puffiness either. My girlfriend told me Preparation H hemeroid ointment actually works and costs much less.  I was hesitant at first but tried it and what do you know, no more puffiness! Save your money, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this religiously since the day someone mentioned about my eyes and till date, could not tell any difference apart from the cooling effect when it goes on. Perhaps others may have a better experience. I can&#x27;t help but think the reviews are slightly skewed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for couple months and don&#x27;t see any improvement at all. It simply do nothing but for the price, I shouldn&#x27;t expect too much. You got what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I like L&#x27;Oreal, it always makes me satisfied, the cold eye roller also.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this cold eye roller to you guys!</li>
    <li> I have been using it twice a day and don&#x27;t see any improvement.  A little disappointing because I have used other L&#x27;Oreal Men&#x27;s products and think they are great.</li>
    <li> Great product, thought size was bigger but well I didn&#x27;t read well how many ml was, overall have use it for 2 days and immediately I feel refreshed  as well feels tighter after I apply it, does the purpose as it states it is a energetic roller so will help you with the thought mornings (or moments during the day), will continue to use to see more results, definitely recommended and it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Keeps the lines under eyes down some for older people and probably younger.</li>
    <li> Works great on my tired under eye pokers in the morning after 10 minutes puffiness goes away and I look great very good product...</li>
    <li> it does not work&lt;br /&gt;I do not see its effect&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s just water with a little caffeine&lt;br /&gt;not worth the money spent</li>
    <li> I use it only to refresh my eyes. However there is no visual effect on the bags so if it&#x27;s for health I say yes, if it&#x27;s for beauty try something else</li>
    <li> It feels nice going on, and there seems to be a slight lessening of the dark circles, but my eyes are still fairly puffy most of the morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this product during the school year so my eyes wouldn&#x27;t look or feel as tired after long nights. It is very easy to roll on and has an immediate cooling sensation. This does make my eyes feel awake. I&#x27;m not convinced it reduces the appearance of bags under the eyes, but the little boost is enough for me.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product I recommend</li>
    <li> Great product good seller no problems</li>
    <li> Seems pointless and gimicky</li>
    <li> This one is in fact \\&quot;Ice Cold\\&quot; however, how well it works, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t tell you. That&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t really notice anything except for the cold effect likely brought on by the metal ball/applicator. I&#x27;ve continued trying it (have been for a 6 months or so) and will continue to try but so far, nothing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week.  The metallic ball roller is very cold to put on in the morning and definitely feels refreshing.  It has not improved the areas around my eyes much, but it is still too early to tell.  Definitely seems like the product will last for a long time; you do not need much to apply around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I have dark spots near the outer corners of my eye - this is most likely due to allergies. So I ordered this product without much hype or hope, and I was correct. It didn&#x27;t help with the dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did work for when I had a rough night/day and dehydrated and had bags under my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied, it&#x27;s a ice cool tingling feeling. Don&#x27;t apply too much or it will crust up and look unsightly and unhygienic.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Men&#x27;s line and love most of their products.  I have been using this every day for just over a week and it&#x27;s just ok for me.  It certainly feels nice and cool going on and my skin feels and looks good, but just a modest improvement to my dark circles.  I will continue to use and update my review if I notice any significant improvements.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfrind who has struggled with dark circles for as long as i can remember. he likes how refreshing it feels in the morning when he uses it. as far as results, i cant really say i noticed it doing anything. he used this for about four months. we switched products.</li>
    <li> I ordered because I trusted the brand name but if anything, its made bags\puffiness worse from the roller (after a month of usage).</li>
    <li> It feels really nice when you apply this product: cool and calm around your eyes. HOWEVER, it doesn&#x27;t tell you how often or how many times you should roll/apply it! They gave as much instruction to use this as a chap stick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results were mixed: I tried applying it at night time, 2x a day, 1 roll per eye, 10 rolls, 20 rolls per eye but in the end I&#x27;m just lost on how to get the most out of it. I felt that the results peaked after a month of use: still have puffy circles but just not as dark anymore. If it had instructions on how to properly apply it, I think I would have better results.</li>
    <li> Love this, use it night and day.  Keep one in my purse.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much...ostensibly I should just get more sleep, but had hoped that would mask the lack thereof when I am up late, or doing things such as writing these nonsensical reviews.</li>
    <li> I am a 35 year old man, and have been using this product for years.  It is hard to tell how much benefit I get from this product, as I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Men&#x27;s Expert for a long time. I always get a lot of compliments on my skin. An ounce of prevention is powerful than restoring your face in the future. Recommend.</li>
    <li> This L&#x27;Oreal eye roller helps reduce the black circles under my eyes to some degree. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of them, but I think it helps...a little. But the roller-ball applicator doesn&#x27;t work well for me, often not depositing much of the liquid on my skin. The [[ASIN:B002UUT45A Nivea For Men Q10 Eye Roller, .5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]has a much better applicator, but the product doesn&#x27;t seem to reduce the black under my eyes at all. This [[ASIN:B0002CD01M ClarinsMen Under Eye Serum]] works OK, but not great either. The ClarinsMen serum does work the best of these three on the baggy areas/minor swelling under my eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of the black. The ClarinsMen has a small pump dispenser, so the gel is applied with your finger. The ClarinsMen product is significantly more expensive though.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Walgreens, about 4 months ago.  Does not seem to make a bunch of difference, I feel a very slight amount of tightening of the skin below my eyes if i use it abundantly then let it dry and repeat two times. However my eyes look only slightly less puffy.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to like this product, but couldn&#x27;t really tell much of a difference. I did like the way it felt going on to my under eyes, but it didn&#x27;t wake me up in any sort of way like it suggests.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product as I have terrible dark circles.  I&#x27;ve been putting it on as directed and have noticed no change.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this roller.</li>
    <li> Used morning and night for 2 weeks, made no difference in my skin whatsoever. The cold metal ball feels nice at first, After repeated use, the skin under my eyes started to get way too dry for comfort, turned red, and itched constantly until I stopped using it. I&#x27;ve never been an allergy prone person. Don&#x27;t waste your cash on this crap. If you want a noticeable change i&#x27;d suggest you  go buy a woman&#x27;s product with some quality ingredient, or something with better reviews. Looks like i&#x27;ll just have deal with these things.  TL;DR Definitely does not work after weeks of diligent use. Buy something better.</li>
    <li> I did not notice this do anything for me. I would recommend trying another brand before you make this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying a little bit of this product every morning and also some nights. I&#x27;ve definitely seen a reduction in puffiness around my eyes. Darkness/baginess has also diminished but the change was not as pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I would say give it shot guys.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son, since he had it on his Amazon Wish List. I have no further info on how he liked it.</li>
    <li> well i was so confused about buy it or not... but finally i decided to buy it, and i like it! it doesn&#x27;t has magic but i feel that helps a little bit against dark circle eyes, its really easy to use i like it.  i would like to buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product will probably not give you instant results, in my opinion though continued use for 2 weeks or more does show an obvious reduction in eye puffiness and dark lines.</li>
    <li> I liked the product but there are a few more things on the market that seem like they work a litter better.</li>
    <li> i really love it. It takes sometime to work but, over time it does what is intended to do, not drastically but good enough.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this to me after using his.  I use it after just waking up, having a hangover, or other extracurricular activities that prevent my eyes from looking as alert as possible. Have not conducted a full on test to see how effective it actually is (hence the 4 stars)</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for a few years now. So it is a &#x27;man&#x27;s&#x27; product... Are men&#x27;s eyes different then woman&#x27;s lol. I find it less expensive then similar female tailored products. Go figure. I am sure it is the same thing. It is does not moisturize so you know. I do not use it daily but just sometimes when my eyes just feel soooo tired this just feels so good and cool. We go to Vegas often, it gets used there everyday!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS A BIG OLE WASTE OF HARD EARNED MONEY  But if you are stupid enough to buy this and then realize for yourself it doesn&#x27;t work, keep the bottle, empty it out, fill it up with filtered or spring water, put it in the fridge and use that on your eye&#x27;s!  THAT WORKS!</li>
    <li> BEST FOR EYE CIRCLES... Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Really really helps with puffy eyes in the morning. I&#x27;m glad I kept it. It tightens up skin and gets rid of tired looking eyes. It has very little scent and does not irritate my ultra sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading one of the reviews on here. The one that mentioned hereditary dark circles was what got me because that&#x27;s my problem. I used this eye roller twice a day as the other reviewer mentioned yet saw absolutely no results. Today I tried a home remedy of putting tea bags on my eyes for an hour and could instantly see a difference whereas after months with the eye roller I didn&#x27;t see anything.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t feel comfortable recommending this to someone who has significant bagginess or dark circles and crows feet around the eye area. It first of all does feel good when applying it but I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as cooling as they advertise just moreso refreshing is a better way to put it. As to the actual performance I really have not noticed any huge improvement over the last 30 days. I don&#x27;t have excessive eye issues so I would have expected beeter results from this product. I have also tried Nivea&#x27;s version of the eye roller and will say the loreal product is better than the Nivea but still it&#x27;s a minimal improvement if any at all. Also they include NO use intructions which makes using the roller even more difficult. My vote is go to a dermatologist and see what they recommend I think the higher cost of a doctors visit would be more worth the money and time spent than these over the counter treatments.</li>
    <li> this is actually a man&#x27;s item, I have used for several months now, and it does help. Esp. when you have a had a little &amp;#34;crying&amp;#34; spell, relieves the swollen under eye area pretty well</li>
    <li> For me, it just does not work.</li>
    <li> Well, I use this, but I&#x27;m not sure if it helps. I guess it soothes the shadows under your eyes a little bit, but nothing that will make it perfect. Overall, I like it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  it did excetly what it suppose to do and it was deleiverd on time.</li>
    <li> My Dad asked me for this product. Loreal it is a good brand...but I need to be honest...I cant see nothing better in his face. For me his eyes still the same.</li>
