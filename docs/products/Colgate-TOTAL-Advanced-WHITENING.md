<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make mouth feel &#x27;clean&#x27;</li>
    <li> I tried another toothpaste that promised the same care, and could hardly wait to get back to using Colgate. Within a few days I saw a significant improvement in cleaning, whitening and freshness. I know it sounds like a commercial, but it&#x27;s not. This toothpaste simply works.</li>
    <li> My teeth are so white, I&#x27;ve blinded all of my coworkers with the supernova burst of light that assaults their ocular cavities where their burned out eyes once dwelled in.  My mouth is so clean, it is now filled with anti-bacteria. Buy this toothpaste, with caution and an understanding of the power you yield. I want to know what the hell that tube is made of, that it can control such a hygenic weapon of teethstruction.</li>
    <li> As a tooth nerd, I HIGHLY recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ads about reducing the fuzzy layer around your teeth isn&#x27;t just BS. This product has triclosan, a bacteriostatic compound (that inhibits bacterial growth) so you don&#x27;t get as much plaque around your teeth. This also helps avoid gingivitis (reddening/inflammation of the gums.)</li>
    <li> These toothpaste both shipped to me busted open. I don&#x27;t know what happened but it was pain to use them.</li>
    <li> Everyone has their favorite brand of toothpaste.  I have used many different types of Colgate brands featuring a concentration of what area you want to focus on when dealing with your dental health.  I have found that this toothpaste tastes very good.  I think a toothpaste product should have a great taste, and give the results that are advertised for each consumer.  They have so many different brand of concentration that do not taste as good to me or members of my household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this product is a bundle set, a great price, and packaging is neat, the size of this toothpaste set lasts us a while, and taste is very important, since this is the first thing you would place in your mouth each morning.  I have tasted many toothpaste brands that taste so badly, I have them etched in my mind to &amp;#34;avoid&amp;#34; like a plague, I would not use them if they were giving them away for FREE.  The Seller has described this product accurately.  I would recommend this product for the reasonable price, bundle set, quality, taste and results you receive from this toothpaste.  The delivery and packaging was great.</li>
    <li> I already used this toothpaste but, could not pass up a deal like this.  Great buy and love that it will ship on a schedule that is flexible.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, you buy in bulk because of the price and because it is not made in China. The lower the price, the more I will purchase.</li>
    <li> It was sad. Waste of money. But Amazon doesn&#x27;t screw up that often. The product is probably fine someone in the warehouse probably just forgot to add the item.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m satisfied with Colgate, I image the other popular brands are equally as good.  At this point best price is the determinant.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this toothpaste. Great taste and make my teeth feel very clean</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is really gentle on not only my gums but  on my teeth. Unlike other &amp;#34;standard brand&amp;#34; toothpastes, it doesn&#x27;t contain abrasives. By that I mean the gritty bits that I&#x27;ve encountered in numerous other store bought whitening toothpastes. At any rate, I typically purchase more expensive whiteners but I switch back and forth between those. I think it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that the skin around my lips can easily be irritated by things like mango ,pineapple ,and toothpaste ,I don&#x27;t feel like  to use kids toothpaste though.&lt;br /&gt;this turned my skin to be red every time after brushed my teeth .as other toothpaste do ,have to keep looking .&lt;br /&gt;but for others that have no skin problems ,they should be good products .</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s toothpaste, nothing too fancy. But Colgate works and I like the minty flavor, that keeps my mouth fresh and clean. Use it twice a day. The price is great, can&#x27;t find any better deal from my local stores; highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought a goody box of stuff for my daughter who is a single mom and this is one of the things in it. You can&#x27;t complain about this product and the price was as good as Walmart too. It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it. She called me up and said MOM what surprise and thank you! I put in many items on here for her and the kids. She runs a child care and even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...lol Thanks for the  great prices too AMAZON!</li>
    <li> This is like magic in my mouth. The power of cleansing is unbelievable. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to have bad dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste tastes great, whitens teeth, and is a great value as well. Extremely convenient, and of an excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Looks smaller in the picture but it is actually a reasonable size when you receive it. 4 stars because 3 days later it was on sale for 2 dollars but it is okay since i got it for a reasonable price. Good buy. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> minty good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Taste good,  fights cavities.  Toothpaste delivered.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste so there&#x27;s not a lot to say.  I use this brand a lot, it has a decent taste to it.  Not sure how much whitening it does but I like to use a whitener just in case it&#x27;s helping.</li>
    <li> not sure if i should love my toothpaste, aren&#x27;t they all the same?</li>
    <li> discovered it uses triclosan so got rid of it - can&#x27;t recommend this, too many issues with triclosan</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste. Worth buying from Amazon with prime or as an add-on for the discount.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste buy far and i buy this over and over.  Leaves teeth feeling simpy clean with a very neutral minty paste.</li>
    <li> Great taste and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive teeth hurt.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste, but can&#x27;t say it really whitens my teeth</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is an extremely personal item. Some people want paste, while others want gel. Some want huge amounts of foam, while others want none. Some like mint and others other flavors. In the end though - toothpaste should really focus on two things: cleaning teeth and preventing oral issues (cavities, gingivitis, plaque, etc). You can add all the extra &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34; into the toothpaste that you want - as long as it does what toothpaste should do, the extra is just that - extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular 2-pack adds &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; to the mix. I&#x27;m not sure how well this works, as my teeth appear just as white today as they did when I first started using this toothpaste years ago. I imagine buying a product that specifically whitens teeth would have a visible and immediate effect, but toothpaste shouldn&#x27;t be expected to give you that &amp;#34;Hollywood glean&amp;#34; that we see in magazines. Does it clean your teeth from coffee stains? Probably - but I won&#x27;t try to convince you that it will remove years of stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor, for me, is just right. I don&#x27;t want to use toothpaste that is &amp;#34;bland&amp;#34; but also want to avoid toothpaste that overpowers my taste buds while I&#x27;m trying to clean my teeth. This paste does the job and does it without any extra bells and whistles. It is a &amp;#34;foamy&amp;#34; toothpaste, so you will end up with a mouth full of white - but for those out there that hate toothpastes that foam, you probably already know this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2-pack is nice, as it ensures I always have a stash of toothpaste sitting around when a tube finally ends. One ends, order another 2-pack, backup arrives. Done. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this toothpaste, as it has kept my teeth clean for years; as confirmed by my dentist. I will say that some people just have bad chompers - they can clean, brush, scrub and still end up with oral hygiene issues...but unless you are one of those, give Colgate a try.</li>
    <li> My family and I use only this toothpaste, and we highly recommend this product.  We are please with the way it helps to keep our teeth clean</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever!  No cavities in my family since we started using this toothpaste about 3 years ago.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does the trick. I&#x27;m sensitive to teeth whitening ingredients, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s a pretty good value if you&#x27;ve got Prime. That&#x27;s really all I can say about toothpaste.</li>
    <li> So many toothpastes to choose from and we&#x27;re very happy&lt;br /&gt;with this choice.  Nice white teeth are very important to us.</li>
    <li> These toothpaste look like fake.</li>
    <li> A great way to get the toothpaste we love and not have to drive clear into town (which happens to be a good 30 miles). The packaging is the same as you would expect in a big store like Sam&#x27;s Club and it&#x27;s still the same great product.</li>
    <li> Great item and saves the lug from the store routine; a must have for all out there, best deal on the net!!</li>
    <li> I switch between Colgate and Crest. I like the toothpastes, but do not like the big caps. Too messy and hard to close after a period of use because the toothpaste builds up along the outside edges.  Do not have that problem with the regular screw type caps.</li>
    <li> Ilike this toothpaste, and it was received as if i had bought it from the store. I am very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> Floss and brush every day.  No cavities in over 20 years while using this Total, which kills the bacteria whose secretions cause tooth decay.  Should be used twice a day.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a standard of great toothpaste brand that my family and I have used for many many years.</li>
    <li> Its toothpaste it cleans it whitenings over time but it taste like toothpaste.</li>
    <li> i love this toothpaste. It just feels cleaner without the alcohol &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; feeling from other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> worked great and did not leave any unpleasant taste, seems to help my teeth stay white despite my coffee/tea habit</li>
    <li> Beware, Colgate Total contains triclosan. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I like hygiene. I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t just come with one, but with two toothpaste! It says it&#x27;s suppose to whiten my teeth. I don&#x27;t feel my teeth being whiten at all, but it&#x27;s only been a week. But it&#x27;s still a bargain! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for at least 3 weeks now and still using it. It has gotten everything off my teeth especially in the nooks and crannies. I am so happy that after I brush my teeth I keep smiling to myself in the mirror.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this toothpaste several times because it works great and freshens the breath. When my total is just under 50 bucks, I buy the toothpaste to round it up and get free super saver shipping. Clean teeth, fresh breath, and more money in my pocket!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how much money it will save me in the future, but it&#x27;s great to get such high quality toothpaste delivered to the front door for all of $5.</li>
    <li> I have been using Colgate Total for years, I really like the clean feeling you get,  I really don&#x27;t notice a whole lot of whitening going on but I think it does help a little when you use regularly as you should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to whiten your teeth look into other products such as [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Luxe Whitestrips Professional Effects - Teeth Whitening Kit 20 Treatments]], but this does help maintain and help keep your teeth white</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Colgate.  I just don&#x27;t like the taste of Crest.  Used to always get the 2-pack at Costco and the tubes were bigger.  I wish these tubes were the bigger ones.  But, I get them through subscribe and save and always have at least 5 items to also save the 15%.  Amazon is then the better deal plus I can order from home and there are no huge crowds or checkout lines like at my local Costco.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, fair price.  What more could you ask?</li>
    <li> This is one of those things that you always forget when shopping.  Ordering online or adding it to my cart when i am getting low and having it delivered to my apt makes it easy for me to not run out of a product that I have come so used to while not costing me anymore than I would have paid at the store.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste and very great value for the price. Leaves a fresh feeling in the mouth and is cheaper than what you get in the department store.</li>
    <li> I did some price checking at Costco, Walmart, and Amazon. This was the best price i could find and on top of that it was not bad! i have bought a more expensive one before this and it doesn&#x27;t compare this one is better!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to get with the Subscribe &amp; Save. I love it. It&#x27;s cheaper than buying in store, it comes straight to my door with free shipping, and I don&#x27;t have to remember to go get it or order it when we&#x27;re running out. :)</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time, and it is cheaper to use prime than buy it in the store!</li>
    <li> I use this line or the Colgate optimum white. They really do help with stain removal from your teeth.</li>
    <li> I have used Colgate Total for several years. Several dental hygeniests recommended it. Not sure about why this chemistry makes it better, but I haven&#x27;t been dissapointed. It may just be a personal preference thing though.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Worth watching for ones like this where I can so easily save $ on stuff I&#x27;m gonna buy anyway.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and got to me quickly.</li>
    <li> I approve of this toothpaste, definitely recommend it to anyone and the twin pack is nice too</li>
    <li> Toothpaste. Does its job. I don&#x27;t buy into the fancy hype about different toothpaste. I just buy Total because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been using for the last 20 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;Note that TSA will NOT let you carry this across security. I had mine confiscated. :(</li>
    <li> This stuff will get your teeth clean! Just brush it on for a while a few times a day for the rest of your life (you&#x27;ll need to order more when you run out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will go from not-white to more-white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(requires teeth and a scrubbing implement for best results)</li>
    <li> whitens teeth and turns them into something brand new. good one from Colgate.</li>
    <li> Kept the teeth of both my boys shining like mirrors. Whitened them to their fullest extent.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite toothpaste and on sale with a coupon--what a bargain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a chemist, so I can&#x27;t really comment on its chemical composition. However, my mouth feels fresh, and looks clean after using this product. I think it&#x27;s a pretty good reason to get five stars from me.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh minty taste. Leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh</li>
    <li> This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling cleaner and fresh longer than my old toothpaste, regular Crest cavity protection toothpaste. It&#x27;s not expensive which is good for college kids like me. It definitely helps prevent bad breath better than my old toothpaste as well. I&#x27;m not sure how strong the whitening is, you won&#x27;t notice any differences in a short amount of time. Overall I think this is a good product for the price (I got it at $4.96).</li>
    <li> Good product nothing special but cheaper then the store. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Great price, and fast shipping. I&#x27;ve always liked Colgate toothpaste, and am very satisfied with this order.</li>
    <li> Who would have guessed?! This toothpaste, used with a tooth brush, cleans my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that I was very impressed!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I really do notice a difference in whiteness and it makes my teeth feel clean afterward!</li>
    <li> Sometimes when I am looking for hard to get items on Amazon, I remember I need something else.  Toothpaste is one of those.  And being able to get a great price with two day delivery to my door... well, that works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> Colgate Total for a clean mouth fresh breath &amp; Whitening!!</li>
    <li> My teeth seem to be a little whiter but Ive been using this stuff for a while and I brush 4 times a day. i feel like they should be whitening faster.</li>
    <li> I love colgate over any other brand. My mouth just feels cleaner and fresher than with Crest or Aquafresh...etc. Reason for 4 stars is i don&#x27;t notice much whitening effect. I am still a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> Best product from Colgate. Being a 2-in-1 product, this promotes more usage of their dental products, primarily this one. Whitens teeth to the core.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for colgate, than the price speaks for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason it doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars is because it&#x27;s mass produced and probably not the healthiest of options.&lt;br /&gt;I still use it but will be looking into more healthy options in the future.</li>
    <li> Use Colgate because the lids don&#x27;t come off.  Toothpaste is toothpaste.</li>
    <li> BEWARE! This type of toothpaste (Total) contains Triclosan as an ingredient which is banned in other countries because it causes brain damage and cancer.</li>
    <li> Tastes like peppermint gum :) I buy this toothpaste in bulk &amp; stockpile it so I never run out. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and my teeth have definitely gotten whiter.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has whitened my teeth a bit- without causing any pain- and it does prevent gingivitis. It tastes and feels great- it helps my breath. Totally my favorite. I have to confirm the other positive reviews.</li>
    <li> This is the reason why. Leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I just wish it could not make my coffee taste like crap after brushing.</li>
    <li> I first bought Colgate Total from a dental hygienist student that was selling these as a fundraiser.  This is also the sample I get when I get a cleaning at the dentist.  It comes in a gel or a paste.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 years now.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste- and great results at the dentist</li>
    <li> could do better job of whitening, pleasant taste</li>
    <li> this toothpaste worked great and came in great flavors. My mouth felt really clean afterwards using it.</li>
    <li> Very good prize and as advertised.  12 Ounces is the combination of both tubes, not just one though.  Would buy it again if prize does not change.</li>
    <li> whitens teeth quickly and without any problems. the only beef I have with other toothpastes is their taste. this one, on the other hand, tastes so nice that you become enticed to brush your teeth daily.</li>
    <li> its toothpaste its fine</li>
    <li> We prefer the 12oz tube size, but regret feeling that the better deal is on the larger tube sizes.  Still, you like what you like.  You can probably find it as cheep on sale at the local drug store, but you cant beat the ship and save for items you use regularly.</li>
    <li> very good . I like it very much .  a nice one.  i will buy one more next time , good</li>
    <li> I like Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste mainly because of its flavor. It gives me a fresh breath. It also foams more than other toothpastes which makes me feel that it is actually working and cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste companies advertise that you need to cover the entire length of your toothbrush when spreading toothpaste.  This is wrong.  You need a small dab.  It will last you much longer.  Have you noticed the size of the head for electronic toothbrushes? almost equal to a dime.  The toothpaste companies have done great marketing in terms of wasting toothpaste! Use what you only need! also try aquafresh.  I like going back and forth.  I used to really enjoy mentadent too, but that didn&#x27;t take a huge impact to the American masses in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste-it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It is the worst feeling in the world when you just spend the whole day chugging soda and chomping on candy so that you get that nice little film over all your teeth. But FEAR NOT! With this perfect concoction of minty flavored delight combined with the best cleaning agents it will leave you and your teeth feeling like a brand new human being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So go brush your teeth and conquer the world.</li>
    <li> product was the product i purchased. The best description i have for it is in the title. check it out.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is Ok. Nothing special, gets the job done and has a average taste, For the money it well worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like it, I will buy. Shopping is very enjoyable. The next time will buy more. Good quality. Very good.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great! It&#x27;s my favorite because I drink a lot of coffee, and it does a great job removing the stains!</li>
    <li> My teeth felt dirty after using this for awhile. Had to go back to Arm and Hammer. Husband even commented that it wasn&#x27;t his favorite.</li>
    <li> I needed something to help me clean my teeth. I looked and looked, and stumbled on TOOTHPASTE. What a NOVEL idea.&lt;br /&gt;And a TWOPACK?! Oh my goodness, I can&#x27;t contain my excitement. BUT WAIT, look, its the TOTAL care. Well, that&#x27;s that. I had to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;And I did. And the packaging was excessive as always, but the tubes have that awesome flip-top I love, and now my mouth is minty fresh.</li>
    <li> Very good price and came on time</li>
    <li> Great value.  I have always used colgate total... seems to do the trick and keep my teeth shiny white!  Always looking for a value pack!</li>
    <li> I think this toothpaste really does make my teeth whiter.  I&#x27;ve tried other toothpastes before that claim they have a whitening effect, but this really does.  I noticed a difference in about two weeks. I do not have discolored teeth to begin with, but everyone could use a little whitening!</li>
    <li> I have to say i like the toothpaste but others love it. I no longer get offered gum and mints all the time and the butter look of my teeth is slowly diminishing.</li>
    <li> want that shine then grab some of that Colgate and  make them  Choppers Shine. i needed that and glad i picked them up. them twins will last a  long time even though i Brush twice a day. however my teeth are sparkling like diamonds.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good toothpaste, keeps away plaque. Tastes good. Minty fresh. Doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth, and really does it&#x27;s job. Nothing wrong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this toothpaste.  I&#x27;m sure it works well, but the texture is weird.  It seems difficult to rinse out of my mouth and leaves a film.</li>
    <li> high quality stuff and is personally my favorite flavor and brand, nothing much to say beyond that. Great price for the quality.</li>
    <li> I firmly believe that all toothpastes are the same.  I spent 20 seconds making this decision and it does exactly what its suppose to.</li>
    <li> this stuff works as toothpaste...do you really need a review??</li>
    <li> as advertised, convenient to order</li>
    <li> Colgate Total has been a trustworthy product for years.  Its flavor isn&#x27;t too strong and its whitening component doesn&#x27;t inadvertently leave bleach marks all over on my colored towels (think Crest).  The top flips open and is flat so you can stand the tube upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve been a lifelong Colgate user.  All other toothpaste brands are dead to me.</li>
    <li> We use this toothpaste quite often in our house. Since I&#x27;m a single dad trying to stick to a budget I don&#x27;t want to spend a ton on toothpaste. I like the affordable price and the fact that it leaves my teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean. I like the mild tingling sensation. The fact that this is a whitening paste is a plus but we don&#x27;t use it all the time for that reason.</li>
    <li> This was part of the add on items you need to buy. I had to spend a couple of dollars for the add on shipping. good vale. Don&#x27;t like the add on thing!</li>
    <li> This tooth paste has a great taste, and it is very economic too. After brushing your teeth it leaves your mouth with a long lasting freshness and clean sensation.</li>
    <li> I have 3 tubes on a reserve and 1 in the bathroom right now. I love the clean feeling that I feel after brushing. I use this toothpaste at least 2-3 times a day and it keeps everything amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of years and my teeth are white as if I use strips.  I drink coffee everyday but you would never know it - Great product.</li>
    <li> Hey!!!  It cleans your teeth like it&#x27;s supposed to but, really, haven&#x27;t seen a toothpaste &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; your teeth yet......including this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste.  I am getting good reviews from my dentist.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste. It has a good  price, a nice size tube, does a good job cleaning my teeth, and has a pleasant taste.  I only gave it 4 starts because there are tons of toothpastes out there and I have not tried a lot to get a good comparison.  I will purchase this product again and have been using it many years.</li>
    <li> Tried and true, our family lives this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve used others, but I definitely love Colgate! Great price and good packaging.</li>
    <li> Prefer another brand but, adequate. Price was determiner.</li>
    <li> good price - will buy again</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste.  In fact, I think it is the best toothpaste on the market.  I used to use some other brands that were highly rated here on Amazon.... but then my dentist asked me which toothpaste I was using, and I told him.  He told me I need to switch to Colgate TOTAL.  I made the switch and I like it.</li>
    <li> I love Colgate total, so when I seen this twin pack I purchased. With Colgate Total I have less sensitivity and a brighter clean smile. I have noticed my mouth feels cleaner longer too. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I prefer the gel over the paste, but this works fine.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about a toothpaste except this one tells the different between the one a be colgate brands out there and the real colgate brand.</li>
    <li> What can I say. Colgate is the greatest toothpaste ever. So good once it hits your teeth. Best day of my life.</li>
    <li> Good buy for those that prefer this type of toothpaste. It last a long time so you get your monies worth instead of buying one tube at a time at a much higher price.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for the price. I recommend it highly. Saves me a trip to the drug store and that is good.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t need this item.</li>
    <li> Price was actually better than Costco when they were having a special sale. Our family has been using Colgate for years and generally like it.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it leaves a great taste and makes my mouth clean. I also see gradual improvement on my teeth since they&#x27;re getting white with continued use.</li>
    <li> I grew up using Colgate which contains Fluoride, a big no-no for me. Now I use this natural toothpaste http://amzn.to/1fAIDlP</li>
    <li> I really like the taste, it&#x27;s not nearly as harsh as others I was using.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste.  Good bargan</li>
    <li> for some reason, this has been the brand that i&#x27;ve always used. i don&#x27;t know, when i think of toothpaste, it&#x27;s colgate i think of. weird.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to toothpaste. I&#x27;m not really sure if it is really whitening my teeth, but the flavor is pleasant and leaves my teeth feeling clean. I&#x27;m not really sure we can expect more from a toothpaste...</li>
    <li> I’ve been a user of Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste for many years because I’ve always tried to maintain a healthy smile (I’m a receptionist so I need a white smile). But because I drink coffee at least twice a day (sometimes more!) and a lot of herbal teas, I’ve found that using just this toothpaste alone doesn’t really get my teeth white...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to get white teeth is to really try some professional products specifically for tooth whitening. I’ve tried a few products, like [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest White Strips]] and found that the strips are really not as good as the trays. Although the Crest White Strips are easy to use, they really DO NOT cover your teeth perfectly like some other professional dental whitening kits. [[ASIN:B00HJDIAGC This Product]] did cover my teeth well however because of their custom heat trays, and whitening my teeth A LOT. I would say if you really want white teeth, use the Colgate Toothpaste and least 2 times a day, along side a professional Gel product like [[ASIN:B00HJDIAGC Shine Whitening]].</li>
    <li> Triclosan is linked to cancer.</li>
    <li> My nephew favorite toothpaste, he loves the taste and it works well for whitening and cleaning his teeth.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste with a great taste which works well and maintains the whitening process. Have been using it for quite some time regularly to my greatest satisfaction. The twin pack available at Amazon is great as it reduces the packaging waste a bit.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any whitening at all, however looking at online testing I don&#x27;t think any toothpaste can really be expected to whiten teeth.  Other than that it gets my teeth nicely clean and has a fresh taste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Colgate! what more can you expect?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in a nice mint favour which I have been used to for years. This comes with whitening formula, but i have yet seen it take effect on my teeth :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend you buy it along with the following brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00763LZWQ/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00763LZWQ&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;nealo10a-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;4Z2M2TJPQ6KEP5L4</li>
    <li> It is time once again to load up all the goodies and get our daughter back to college. Amazon makes part of that process much easier -- she lives off campus and we help out by purchasing most necessities on Amazon and having them shipped directly to her at school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One example is this twin pack of Colgate whitening toothpaste; it is a decent deal and she likes the stuff, saying it cleans her teeth nicely while leaving them feeling smooth, and that it has a nice taste. She prefers paste style toothpastes over the gel type, so this is just right for her preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a similar need, we recommend this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using bargain toothpaste so long, I forgot how good the real stuff is!  This tastes great and leaves your mouth feeling clean and smelling fresh.  As for whitening, haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell, but that would be the cherry on top.</li>
    <li> After 3-4 weeks the toothpaste builds up and stays caked onto the brush. I have not had this problem before, and it is gross.</li>
    <li> Pretty standard stuff as far as toothpaste goes, but my wife and I like the taste/texture better than other toothpastes. Not sure how well it whitens because it is not easy to compare. I would recommend it and priced well on Amazon.</li>
    <li> All round good toothpaste</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give the clean feeling. I never like Colgate and still don&#x27;t .</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste.  I hear that some people are allergic to whitening according to my hygienist.</li>
    <li> What more can you say.  I bought it as a matter of convenience.  I&#x27;ve been using this Colgate for over 20 years and I&#x27;m going to continue using it.</li>
    <li> what you would expect</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Crest toothpaste.  It is as expected - but the value and convenience here on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I have used Colgate almost my entire life, so when I saw the two pack for just $6, I had to get them as backups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually get smaller tubes because they don&#x27;t use so much counter space, but I could not miss this deal. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;I leave them in the guest room, so I can store them in a drawer. I just hope having such a large tube will not make my guests feel they can stay an extra month &amp;#60;g&amp;#62;! ;-)</li>
    <li> its the only one that makes my teeth feel clean other brands I just feel like something on my teeth</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pleasant tasting mouth detergent. It does the job. I only buy dopey stuff like this online when I need to add something to my order to put me over the $35 free shipping threshold.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste but after time the tip will get clogged with dried paste even if you close the top tightly every time.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if these had the large caps so you can stand them upright and pleased to find they do.  Good price and excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for years. I wish had known how bad Total was for me. Google triosoclan and read for yourself.</li>
    <li> CONTAINS TRICLOSANE - SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste at a good value. It cleans my teeth. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got on this one. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these and that was my mistake. Contains an ingredient that causes cancer, need I say more.</li>
    <li> As advertised product</li>
    <li> I used another brand my entire life until I got a sample of Colgate Total from my dentist. I switched the same day and have never looked back. This is a great product especially the tartar control!</li>
    <li> Like I would expect from Colgate, this toothpaste does a great job cleaning my mouth. If you are looking for some major whitening, spend the money on a professional product. However, if you would like a little brightening with your clean teeth, then this toothpaste will work for you.</li>
    <li> everyday product I like</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste, good price on subscribe and save</li>
    <li> Leaves my teeth feeling so fresh and so clean, clean *sings*</li>
    <li> What can I say it&#x27;s toothpaste</li>
    <li> My husband prefers this brand and variety.  It is nice to have two pack for convenience  His teeth seem to be whiter with the use of this product.</li>
    <li> My son likes it.  good!!</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is okay, but the cap is engineered so you can&#x27;t use all of it without a fight.  We can&#x27;t see inside the box ahead of time, but maybe another brand is worth trying.  Just a bit frustrating.</li>
    <li> Colgate Total is the most protective otc toothpaste in the world. And this is a good price. I bought this cause this is my brand &amp; I needed a filler to get free shipping.</li>
    <li> This twin pack is one of the better toothpaste deals.  I put this on subscription, which adds a nice discount, good option for something we will always need.  I will note that, as a coffee drinker, this doesn&#x27;t do anything special for whitening.  It does ok, but I tried Colgate Optic White before, and that did a better job as just a whitener.  I still use this though, as I&#x27;m not comfortable using real whitener (peroxide based) for long periods of time, I feel this is better all around.</li>
    <li> Hey, it is toothpaste. What do you want me to say? It works. It is Colgate and trustworthy. Price was right.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price! Much better than tracking it down at my local stores too! Nothing better than buying all of your household needs on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this toothpaste really whitens that well compared to others. It seemed like a good deal at the time.</li>
    <li> I really like the consistency of this paste, flavor is good and leaves a cleaning sensation after using it, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought many times and always happy with the service and the product!</li>
    <li> We keep coming back to this one so it must be our favorite.  We try others and return to this.</li>
    <li> What is there to be said about toothpaste.... tastes good and makes my teeth the freshest.</li>
    <li> Very good brand! Arrived in good order!</li>
    <li> I was sort of hoping that the tubes were bigger given the price but somehow they really appear like the usual toothpaste (not sure if in fact they are larger to add to the value).  That said, this is a good brand and nothing is more convenient then Amazon.  Leaves teeth feeling very clean with a nice taste.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, I am a big fan of the colgate total line, I like to use something that covers quite a few areas at once. knock on wood I have had no problems keeping my teeth healthy with this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already bought these before, and it works. I&#x27;m not sure about the more whitening, because there&#x27;s no changes in the color of my teeth. Other than that, it does protect my teeth though. I can feel it. Haha. It&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> I use this with an electric toothbrush to keep my pearly whites, white. Good, not too abrasive. Does tend to clog up my sink after prolonged use, but otherwise is fine. The clog is easily cleared up with a little lye.</li>
    <li> colgate always the best... and total is my favorite...</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different brands.  Colgate total is the best and it is highly recommended by dentists</li>
    <li> I thought these would be the smaller size toothpaste but they turned out to be pretty big so that is awesome. I really only needed enough to finish this semester but now I will have enough for next semester too!</li>
    <li> Great deal! Awesome toothpaste!</li>
    <li> This works well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I definitely recommend buying and using it frequently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Colgate Total for many years. Whenever I travel, I buy whatever tiny tube is available, and I can definitely tell the difference. My teeth feel cleaner all day when I use total as compared to other brands. I hope they never stop making this because I plan to use it forever.</li>
    <li> Great price and good quality product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste. If the dentist doesn&#x27;t complain, neither do I.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does not leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Good old faithful toothpaste.  It&#x27;s been around since before I was born.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  Cleans well  and has a pleasant refreshing after taste.</li>
    <li> I feel rather silly for reviewing toothpaste, but I am very satisfied with this purchase.  The tubes have the new high tech large flip tops, not the old ones that are more prone to get clogged up and messy.  Great value.</li>
    <li> A total win on this one. Price is great and Colgate is a great toothpaste no matter what especially if you have sensitive teeth like me. And it comes with 2 :)</li>
    <li> Feels inferior. Not sure if it is the genuine product .Doubt that I will by this online again.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.  Better pricing here than at my local stores.</li>
    <li> This seems like a good product, but I just read an article on Businessweek that claims it has an &amp;#34;ingredient linked to hormones, cancer&amp;#34;. Tricolasan is the chemical at issue apparently. Not sure where to go from here but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this brand for a while... to me, toothpaste is toothpaste, but I was pleased to find it in my bag of samples from my dentist, reaffirming that it is their brand of choice. The whitening isn&#x27;t anything drastic, but I do like the way Total makes my teeth feel clean for much longer in the day/night.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for some time, and the twin pack was a very good deal price-wise especially when added to an order that got free shipping.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was rated the worst to use due to the ingredient in it</li>
    <li> We had used Total for years but stopped last year after seeing some stories on what seem to be risks tied to triclosan.  Colgate&#x27;s response to these claims so far have been what one might expect ... and insufficient for my taste.  I&#x27;d rather not take chances in this area.&lt;br /&gt;For those that would like to know more, a balanced story on the topic from a reputable source can be found here:  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-11/in-35-pages-buried-at-fda-worries-over-colgate-s-total</li>
    <li> Great value, terrific product!!!</li>
    <li> This is toothpaste, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you. You brush it on your teeth to clean them. It satisfactorily cleans my teeth. If you want toothpaste, this just might be the product for you.</li>
    <li> I brush my teeth about 4-5 times/day and have been using Colgate for 35 years.  No cavities, and an overall healthy mouth.  The subscribe and save eliminates trying to remember to buy toothpaste.  That&#x27;s a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a brand which most of humanity is used to. Colgate even makes tooth powder for use in rural villages. This is good, though the cap and how you close needs something to be desired. I like the regular opening found. This one has a much flatter way, in which you can keep the toothpaste on standing position, upside down. Freshness is awesome!</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. pleasant flavor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Easier than walking/driving to the store to get toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now never have to leave my home for anything except for food. Amazon needs to start selling milk, then I can sell my car and relax at home for my life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
    <li> It a little bit weird to write a review on toothpaste I think but here it goes! Colgate works and the total brand does the job. I used many other brands and once in a while I alternate with some of the other suspects which have even bigger claims I find myself reverting back to total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the whitening part... I don&#x27;t really notice anything which I guess is a good thing considering they continue to be white! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good price and will get to you fast. Plus honestly it&#x27;s great to always have a pair of extras laying around. Makes me feel luxurious!! :-)</li>
    <li> great minty toothpaste that should last longer due to buying the twin pack.</li>
    <li> Fan of Colgate Total. Purchasing online makes it easy and convenient. Never have to squeeze the last bit of toothpaste out of the tube again!</li>
    <li> I buy this for my kids top brand at the best price, it dose the job and wont hurt your wallet.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpast and how it gives you that fresh feeling for hours. The value pack also makes this an even better purchase. Amazing product at an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Just plain old ordinary toothpaste. Sam as you would get in the store. Nothing extra or less about it. Worked great. My teeth smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> Ordered because of success with the dentist&#x27;s samples.  We each had preferences that extend for years.  However Colgates Total successfully replaced our long term brands.  Taste is good and affect on plaque build-up is excellent. We both floss religiously and brush 2X or more daily.  We received an A+ from our dentist.  We&#x27;re both 81 years old.</li>
    <li> It is toothpaste.  It freshens your breath and whitens your smile.  I have an overwhelming amount of confidence every morning after brushing with this product.  Although I am not a dentist, I recommend using this product after every meal.</li>
    <li> This is a good deal on this toothpaste. I usually buy in the store, but came across this and had to add it to the order. Love the toothpaste. It has a nice fresh flavor, and isn&#x27;t overly harsh on the inside of my mouth like some of the other leading brands. I was very happy that the package was at my door within a couple days after I placed my order.</li>
    <li> This is a good toothpaste and I think I got a good deal on it. The tubes are the kind that stand up on their caps. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just your standard Colgate Total that you would always expect it to be.</li>
    <li> It is toothpaste and it is Colgate, buying in bulk in bulk is just cheaper and the stuff works. Buy it put it under the sink and you will use it sooner or later.</li>
    <li> Too expensive.  It is 2.5x more expensive than AIM toothpaste and the only extra thing it has is triclosan.  Triclosan is known to decrease testosterone levels and increase estrogen levels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a very loyal Colgate user since I have not tried using other brands. What&#x27;s keeping me to use it is the fact that it whitens teeth and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. It also has very nice taste.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal so I am happy I found it. I decided to try this toothpaste because of the low abrasion rating it has. My teeth feels smooth all day and the toothpaste is easy to rinse out, it doesn&#x27;t leave a strong taste in my mouth. I love the flip top cap and the size of the toothpaste, it lasts pretty long for me. It didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth at all but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. This is supposed to prevent cavities, gingivitis and plaque but after the second tube was almost gone I noticed two small cavities even though I brush twice a day.</li>
    <li> I have used Colgate for years and years.  It is usually less expensive than its main competitor, Crest.  What I like best is the taste.  For some reason I don&#x27;t like the taste of any Crest toothpaste.  And Colgate seems highly effective for me, since I have very little tooth decay, given I am an middle aged adult.</li>
    <li> the only kind my husband uses</li>
    <li> This is my toothpaste brand that im using for a long time already. Did also try some other brands from time to time but i always switch back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;A bit more expensive than non branded one but its worth to pay a bit more to get the real deal</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is smooth and not overly minty. The price is good and it gives teeth a nice shine! Some other brands can have an abrasive feel, and nearly burning flavor that overwhelms the mouth. This one provides the perfect balance of clean and fresh while being from a brand that is well known.</li>
    <li> Great! Cheaper than supermarkets! And fast shopping! Seldom have tooth bleeding after use this toothpaste! I&#x27;ll but it next time!</li>
    <li> Good product and price.  I&#x27;ve always liked this particular toothpaste -- not too harsh and doesn&#x27;t give me canker sores.</li>
    <li> On time delivery. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while. Can&#x27;t say it whitens my teeth but they&#x27;re not getting any worse. Note, I&#x27;m a nonsmoker &amp; drink only one cup of coffee.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, this product does exactly what it claims it does... whiten teeth. I am an avid coffee drinker, so I wanted to test the product on a &amp;#34;power-user&amp;#34; such as myself.  I drink about 6 metric liters per day and combine it with Oreo cookies and cigar smoking.  So you can imagine my surprise when I saw near-immediate improvement!  I witnessed this first-hand the first time I used it on one of my teeth (as a controlled experiment).  It went from a shade of browinish-yellow-tan to a lighter shade of brownish-yellow-tan seemingly overnight. [actual time: 4 weeks]  All I did was apply about .5 ounces, five to eight times daily upon said tooth, scrubbed with a twisted-knot industrial stripping brush hooked up to my Dremmel, and BINGO.  Instant results: tooth was mildly less brownish, provided you looked at it under UV light at the correct angle.  Only downside... complete loss of feeling in my mandibular nerve*.  No biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real secret to this product lies in it&#x27;s alternative uses.  For example, I also used it to whiten other things.  One time, I had red and itchy eyes because I play COD4 in my parents&#x27; basement 13 hours a day, so I mixed a dab of the toothpaste with hydrogen peroxide and kerosene and used an eye-dropper to treat it.  After about 16 hours of intense pain and crying, the red eye was gone, albeit replaced by blurred vision and hallucinations, but what remedy doesn&#x27;t have side-effects, right?  I also used it to whiten fabric.  Just apply 1 ounce of toothpaste to 2 liters of liquid bleach, mix with fabric, and instant white!  This stuff is incredible - now I see why they call it &amp;#34;Total&amp;#34;.  I tried branching out beyond the whitening uses by injecting it into my BluRay player to see if it would improve my HDMI signal, but let&#x27;s just say that failed miserably and I immediately regretted that decision.  That one&#x27;s on me.  But otherwise, this product is fantastic.  Not only will it moderately lighten shades of horrific brown to a less-horrific brown, but when combined with other products, it is unstoppable.  Case-in-point: mix with super glue, and BOOM! - instant minty super glue that has reduced adhesive properties.  Check and mate.  Your move Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Results not typical.wn to a less-horrific brown, but when combined with other products, it is unstoppable.  Case-in-point: mix with super glue, and BOOM! - instant minty super glue that has reduced adhesive properties.  Check and mate.  Your move Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Results not typical.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste seems to make my mouth feel cleaner than others, so I keep it coming on a regular basis.  Reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> A trusted brand for years and the best Quality. This always seemed to be the one item I would overlook on my grocery list. Not anymore !!! I have several common items for the home on AutoShip and it makes it perfect for keeping your supply on track.</li>
    <li> Great price for 2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as advertised and leaves your breath minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought two and I leave one at work so I don&#x27;t kill my coworkers with coffee breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do the same! They will appreciate it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a value pack. with Prime it&#x27;s a good buy. Will buy the product if the price keeps competitive. Triple pack might be even better.</li>
    <li> Large tube of toothpaste, foams very well with little product, and leaves the mouth feeling clean. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Never forget the tooth paste! Comes right to the door!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001KYS2UA Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste Twin Pack (two 6oz tubes)]] Don&#x27;t feel it actually whitens teeth, however the taste is good</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference but I like the taste.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I by this paste in between the other more expensive whitening pastes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the taste and feel of Colgate, but I can buy cheaper brands that are of comparable quality and size at Target or Walmart.</li>
    <li> I love the foaming action.  My mouth feels fresh and clean.  I have no complaints. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste nearly exclusively.  I always like the taste and texture, and my teeth feel clean for longer after using it than other brands.</li>
    <li> i rated this okay because i am a couponer and didnt realize that it is cheaper when you go to the drugstore and use coupons! maybe if the price dropped a little</li>
    <li> The product appears the same but the packaging is worthless. This is the brand/size/flavor/paste that I have used for quite a while. It appears that Colgate is trying to save a fraction of a cent so Amazon can lower the price. The tube material is so thin and insubstantial one expects it to disintegrate in one&#x27;s hand. The cap is also far thinner. It is held on by 2 little plastic hinges. They are so thin that one broke in about a week. The other will go at any time in the very near future. That somewhat obviates the convenience of an attached cap.</li>
    <li> There is another Colgate whitening item in Amazon subscription, which is the same but sales for more. This review is for the value pack. It is cheaper when purchased as a monthly subscription.  The ounce comes out to be .42 cents the other one is .54 oz.  I bought both to compare and the product is the same so I ended up cancelling the other one and kept this one.  comparison: Colgate Total Whitening Paste, Anticavity Fluoride and Antigingivitis Toothpaste, Paste, 6 oz (170 g)  $5.19 $3.39 ($0.57/oz) Subscribe &amp; Save: $3.22 ($0.54/oz)</li>
    <li> Looks and tastes just like toothpaste, even seems to clean your mouth, I&#x27;ve noticed that if you apply it to a brush with bristles, it&#x27;s at least 90% more effective at degrading bad breath and scrubbing teath</li>
    <li> Please educate yourselves on the chemical \\&quot;Triclosan\\&quot; found in this product and many others. Triclosan is a known endocrine disruptor and is considered toxic. This chemical is currently being considered for ban in the U.S. and is banned in several other countries. It may work, but you have no idea what it is doing to your body and it is harmful to the environment. Some healthier alternatives would be Australian tea tree oil, grapefruit seed extract, and pine oil. For more information on triclosan, refer to the EPA website.</li>
    <li> Great add-on for $1.99</li>

    <li> I save money due to the high volume of people that comes to visit me. This offer works great for my family.</li>
    <li> This was my wife and my favorite toothpaste for over 4 years until the latest research info on its #2 ingredient.  Look at the back of the box or tube for the ingredients (Amazon has a picture):  #2 is triclosan, the active ingredient in \\&quot;Total\\&quot; anti-gingivitis.    \\&quot;Triclosan is a bacteria-killing chemical used in Colgate Total toothpastes...  It has been shown to interfere with thyroid signaling and male and female sex hormone signaling.\\&quot;  www.ewg&lt;dot&gt;org/enviroblog/2014/01/chemicals-should-disappear-cosmetics    \\&quot;Research has shown that triclosan:  - Alters hormone regulation in animals  - Might contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant germs  - Might be harmful to the immune system\\&quot;  www.mayoclinic&lt;dot&gt;org/triclosan/expert-answers/FAQ-20057861    \\&quot;Animal studies have shown that triclosan alters hormone regulation.\\&quot;  www.fda&lt;dot&gt;gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm205999.htm    \\&quot;Studies have increasingly linked triclosan (and its chemical cousin triclocarban), to a range of adverse health and environmental effects from skin irritation, endocrine disruption, bacterial and compounded antibiotic resistance, to the contamination of water and its negative impact on fragile aquatic ecosystems.\\&quot;  www.beyondpesticides&lt;dot&gt;org/antibacterial/triclosan.php    *EDIT*  We switched to a non-\\&quot;Total\\&quot; version of Colgate (Crest is fine too, but wife still prefers Colgate) from PERSONAL choice of selecting a toothpaste that has no potential side effects from Triclosan, but clean teeth just as well.</li>
    <li> I’ve been a user of Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste for many years because I’ve always tried to maintain a healthy smile (I’m a receptionist so I need a white smile). But because I drink coffee at least twice a day (sometimes more!) and a lot of herbal teas, I’ve found that using just this toothpaste alone doesn’t really get my teeth white...</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.  Gives you that clean taste after brushing.  This, along with my Oral B electric toothbrush, has my teeth noticibly cleaner and whiter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, it arrived on time and in good condition. I am not exactly a connoisseur of toothpaste, so I am not sure if it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I love the cap, how it allows my boys to stand the tube in end. It&#x27;s a nice easy flip top and helps them keep the bathroom a little bit cleaner. Lets face it- with 5 boys, every little bit helps...a lot!</li>
    <li> Happy with the price, does a good cleaning with a good taste.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SOMETHING EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN OPINION. I MYSELF LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> Teeth are noticeably whiter after a few months of use.  Don&#x27;t know if this soley because of the toothpaste or due to the soniccare toothbrush or a combination of both...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again though.</li>
    <li> The most amazing toothpaste- I put a small dab on my toothbrush and use it on my teeth twice a day and the toothpaste does its job of keeping them clean, fighting plaque and... well everything else toothpaste is suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s toothpaste, what are you really expecting?</li>
    <li> Like the product, love the double amount and the price point.  Colgate always makes a good product you can rely on.</li>
    <li> I usually just buy my toothpaste at the store, but I was very busy and was ordering other things anyways. It worked out because this is exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Colgate standard toothpaste that helps a bit to whiten teeth.  Does not perform any miracles though.  And the price is competitive but not really a bargain.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed. It says total whitening.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months and I&#x27;m still an Asian. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Great value for a great product. Tastes great and leaves your mouth fresh feeling. I will definitely recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This is a nice place to get your order.  They delivery on time, and always no problem with product you order.  I will continue to order this item because it&#x27;s easier to get from them than to go shopping I really like to do my ordering on line it is very easy for me.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does work but it doesn&#x27;t whiten your teeth as Crest 3D.  I been using Colgate Total Whitening for years and it is a good products.  When Crest 3D first came out, I thought I&#x27;ll give it a tried.  I notice my teeth is whiter after a month use.  The price is almost the same, so I rather use Crest 3D instead.</li>
    <li> Colgate was the only one allowed in our household and is the only one I buy for my family.  I was really disappointed that it was taken off of the subscribe &amp; save.  Please bring it back!</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks and I have noticed a difference in how white my teeth are now compared to when I was using the cheap Aim toothpaste. What a difference! I also like the taste of this toothpaste, and the texture better than the cheap stuff, although I think it is very similar to Crest or a more expensive brand. I really like this toothpaste, the only negative is that it is a little more expensive than some other toothpastes out there. But you get what you pay for! - and this toothpast is great.</li>
    <li> I always use Colgate Total because my teeth always feel super clean all day.</li>
    <li> i brush my teeth constantly. for the volume the price is good. arrived as expected and on time. i love it xoxoxo</li>
    <li> Our favorite toothpaste. Does a great job of brightening and whitening!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. My teeth are pearly white now.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste I use, have had great checkups since starting to use it, since I&#x27;m not religious about (especially) flossing, this is an easy switch to make that does help.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice clean feel. Also love that this was a lightning deal add on item- great price at under $2!!</li>
    <li> My Grandfather was a dentist and he recommended and have used ever since.To this day, my visits with Dentist tend to be uneventful, leading me to believe the toothpaste and daily flossing has something to do with that!!!</li>
    <li> Great and as advertised!</li>
    <li> okay deal for toothpaste that goes to your door step directly. it&#x27;s not one of thoese advanced ones but normal use is fine&lt;br /&gt;used it in combination with hammer&#x27;s whitening gel</li>
    <li> This does just fine as a basic toothpaste.  Not a miracle whitener or anything, but it is OK with me.</li>
    <li> To pasty, to thick consistency, but it works fine after off rinse your mouth 3 or 4 times. probably not buy this toothpaste again</li>
    <li> The price is better by a few dollars than Safeway, walmart, target, so it&#x27;s actually worth it to buy them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s colgate total - good toothpaste.  Keeps our mouths clean &amp; tartar buildup minimal.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy toothpaste here, and probably this particular product.</li>
    <li> Good product at a bargain price we like Colgate Total seeing it on tv ads word of mouth was very big influence.</li>
    <li> feels nice and clean. I prefer it over the blue kind with the pieces of listirine breath strips. good buy</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 4 months and it just goes 1/4 for only one pack...So if you buying this product it will last a long time. And it looks good too, my teeth are brighter than before.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is fine.  The tube dispenser seems to be messy.</li>
    <li> Forgot to add this to my order I paced the other day, when I tried to order this and my laundry detergent, however since this was an &#x27;add on&#x27; item I could not order it since my total was under $25 and as prime member it would be too costly to ship.  Crap, the online help offered no help, other then buying the eight pack of toothpaste, I do not need eight tubes of toothpaste, so long story short the add on item program screwed me</li>
    <li> The toothpaste arrived unopened and brand new, exactly what I expected :) The cavity kind has a better taste, but the total is a great all in one toothpaste. I am confident I will have no cavities while using this paste. It is magical.</li>
    <li> I have always like Colgate. The taste is great, and the Total care is also great. This is not one of those toothpastes that leaves that film in your mouth so it feels like your gums are peeling off. This is a great tasting, leave your mouth fresh toothpaste, and helps fight cavities, freshens breath, and whitens your teeth all at the same time. I would recommend this to anyone that uses toothpaste.</li>
    <li> great toothpast.  Makes your mouth feel clean and fresh and keeps your teeth &amp;#34;dentist cleaning&amp;#34; white till your next appointment.</li>
    <li> These are large tubes and very economical. The gel is good for use with electronic toothbrushes. Pleasant and fresh taste.</li>
    <li> This is good toothpaste. It tastes good and gets your teeth white. I can&#x27;t really tell the differences between any of the leading toothpastes though.</li>
    <li> Just opened,new packaging for tootpaste..same size box, new design of tube.  Now holding 25% less toothpaste.  Big corps got us again![[ASIN:B001KYS2UA Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste Twin Pack, 12-Ounce]]Previous each tube contained 8 ounce each, now cut down to 6 ounce</li>
    <li> I use Colgage Toothpaste all the time.  It is an excellent product  and meet the standards of the asvertisers. you will never regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Best tooth paste EVER.  Cheap, and great.  I am still currently using the second one, and I bought this like 3 months ago.</li>
    <li> it is refreshing, not irritating, good smell. it was made in USA,  trustworthy, plus Colgate 360 Full Head Toothbrush, perfect match.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Leaves teeth feeling fresh without leaving an offensively minty taste all day. Leaves that clean, slick feeling you enjoy only with a good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Full Disclosure: I went to Colgate University.  Therefore, I use Colgate toothpaste.  This is a natural pairing.  Gotta show my Colgate pride.  Go Raiders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fiancee recently purchased Crest at the local supermarket because it was on sale for $0.99.  She was quickly punished.  A few hours in the corner taught her the lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a product standpoint, does whitening toothpaste work?  Who can tell?  Not me, I&#x27;m no scientist.  I went to a Liberal Arts school.</li>
    <li> however the &amp;#34;title is a little misleading, it says twin pack 12 -ounce, but it is 2 units of 6-ounces each for a total of 12 (Still a good deal), just keep that in mind so that you are not disappointed when you receive the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste.  No better, no worse than any other toothpaste.  It&#x27;s 2 tubes and seemed to be a good deal when I signed on for the subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> This is Colgate toothpaste. It&#x27;s about as Colgate toothpaste-y as any Colgate toothpaste ever was. It&#x27;s the most Colgate-y toothpaste in my entire order and the most toothpaste-y toothpaste I have ever used to paste my teeth. O! Colgate! Thou art toothpaste! Brushy, brushy, aaah.</li>
    <li> Tooth paste, but cheaper. DONE&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Make Your Own dental care products.    Cloves SOLVE Gingivitis.    Here is a simple HOMEMADE toothpaste that REALY WORKS and can be swallowed without risk to your health.    Coconut Oil Mixed With Xylitol.    That&#x27;s right , two healthy ingredients. Just mix the two together in about equal amounts. Both ingredients kill bad bacterias and leaves your teeth feeling so clean.    For more serious gingivitis, halitosis, etc, Get some whole cloves, carefully bite off the pointy end to make the oils release more. Carefully put the clove in your mouth near the ares with the most problems, under the tongue, between tooth and gum, etc.    After two or three days of this regime you will wonder why all these \\&quot;toothpaste and mouthwash\\&quot; products form the corptocrazy even exist.    This has been a public service announcement and made with love. I use these remedies every day and THEY WORK.    Be careful with cloves, they are pointy. You could buy pure clove oil and rub small amounts on your gums but I like using the whole clove.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is alright, and freshens my breath, but is not my favorite flavor of toothpaste. It is white paste, not gel (not sure if it states that anywhere).</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about, but it does have a good taste and my dentist seems happy. Great product for a great value.</li>
    <li> I really hate to share. I hate to share even with my wife. So, the Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste Twin Pack was the perfect solution for me. She gets her own tube of toothpaste, and we no longer fight in the morning when we are getting ready for work. I do not like a lid on my toothpaste and this forced us to attend marriage counseling twice a week. Now, im saving hundreds of dollars on counseling and I have lower blood pressure.</li>
    <li> saved me from going to store and a good price!&lt;br /&gt;good bargin at this price and its good to have on hand</li>
    <li> What a value--and I use this all the time.  This is so well priced for my favorite paste!  Thanks, Mary</li>
    <li> I have used Colgate total since it came to the market in the 90&#x27;s.  Colgate has made several improvements over the years.  I am 43 and I have had only one cavity in my life.  I didn&#x27;t start seeing a dentist until I was 24.  My only cavity was in 97.  It just WORKS!  Don&#x27;t overspend, buy Colgate total and brush daily.  I do combine this with the use of listerine advance, now ultra listerine.  I usually buy generic at supermarket, Walgreens, or when on sale at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good stuff - much better than Crest.</li>
    <li> Does what it is designed to and more</li>
    <li> Been using this brand for a while.  Good value</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste because it comes in a two-pack, so I don&#x27;t have to try to squeeze the very last bits out of the first tube when I&#x27;m done to avoid the annoying trip to CVS, and also because I like the kinds of toothpaste that have the flip caps so you can close them with one hand. I also feel as though they are far less messy than the ones with twist caps, and can stand upright on their own which is always a great counter space saver. The taste is fresh and clean, and is not even as horrible if you drink OJ afterwards like some of flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, 2 solid tubes of toothpaste. Well done, Colgate.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste. Shipped perfectly.</li>
    <li> Good product that I used to purchase at store, but now have one less product to put on my list.  So easy to order on Amazon.  Price is competitive too.</li>
    <li> Good Product&lt;br /&gt;Recommended&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA</li>
    <li> good toothpaste, can&#x27;t say it really whitens my teeth</li>
    <li> Now concerned about the chemical still being used in this product.  I was unaware of the ingredients when I ordered this multipack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for 15 years; the old style with old style heads. They recommend gel toothpaste, but since I improved my &#x27;dry mouth&#x27; Colgate gel has been too slobbery. I gave the paste a try, but I don&#x27;t believe it gets my teeth as clean. It may be a better product for manual tooth brushing as well... why the 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> its toothpaste what else is to be said.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works and tastes okay.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth getting any whiter but its probably doing some good! :)</li>
    <li> Good price, good toothpaste. Nothing wrong with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again if I need to get more later.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was bored and I like the aspect of getting stuff shipped tomy front door. Ended up being really good toothpaste. I will buy again</li>
    <li> nothing to say its toothpaste.</li>
    <li> For the price, this was a great deal, glad i found them. One tube is so expensive now, of any brand, so this was a good find</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste. Nothing spectacular but we like the flavor and the clean feeling it leaves after brushing. Can&#x27;t say I have noticed any &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; per say.</li>
    <li> Good value...how much more can you really say. Colgate is good. Ive been using this for a while and it works.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft paste.&lt;br /&gt;Best deal on the market. Great price and good quality. I recommend everyone to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I love colgate over any other brand. My mouth just feels cleaner and fresher than with Crest or Aquafresh...etc.However, i don&#x27;t notice much whitening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For teeth whitening effect, I will recommend&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00336EUTK/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00336EUTK&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;civcikdx-20</li>
    <li> I do enjoy this brand of whitening toothpaste. after about 4 weeks I noticed a increase in brightness so i am satisfied. The flavor of it is kinda low on the minty scale but nothing bad.</li>
    <li> Good and basic toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best toothpaste on the market. Well known by everyone. Buying it this way is a deal. At a great price. Would purchase more. Recommend this seller. Dorothea Smith.</li>
    <li> So as a college student, I&#x27;m too lazy to go to CVS (which is 3 blocks away by the way) and so I decided to order it online. It&#x27;s a great value pack but unfortunately it&#x27;s not a very strong toothpaste at all. I have to use listerine after to ensure I acquire that &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34; feeling. I highly recommend Crest 3D white (I recently bought). It&#x27;s a little more expensive but hey it&#x27;s worth it when you flash that bright white smile :)</li>
    <li> It saved me a trip to go to Walmart.  It is a trustable brand at a valued price.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase because it&#x27;s easy to buy and getting it delivered to the house is great.  The toothpaste itself is fine, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Colgate most of my life and I see no reason to change.  The product has changed slightly have different types, etc., but the product is a good product that has always held up to the test for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I can now buy it on-line as part of a program such as the Subscribe and Save makes it very affordable and easy.</li>
    <li> So glad that I can get this product at CAmazon.</li>
    <li> Watch for sales on this double pack and find the prices better than in the local stores.  Use Colgate primarily and will continue as my dentist approves of my hygiene.  Like the large tube for extended use.</li>
    <li> The formulas for most toothpaste is about the same. Read the labels. Only the advertising claims are different. I just happen to like this toothpaste version for use with my Sonicare toothbrush. You just have to pick the consistency you like</li>
    <li> This product is good. High quality, good service, and fast ship. It is sutable with my think brfore I got it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste! What more can I say? It works...keeps my teeth minty and clean. The price is great. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I always use this product.  My teeth get clean, I don&#x27;t know if it really whitens but since I am a coffee drinker I imagine it helps just to keep it from getting worse.  I have healthy teeth, always have, and grew up using colgate.  Just bought it online to save time by stocking up on some essentials without a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> I like this tooth paste</li>
    <li> The convenience of getting toothpaste at a reasonable price is a treat for me-I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out if I forget to buy it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, what do you want?  Oh you want a reason to choose this toothpaste over another?  well ok...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate was the first company to earn FDA approval for prevention of gingivitus with Colgate Total in the 90&#x27;s and the brand is still going strong today.  Also, Colgate Total uses sodium flouride, which has fewer side effects as opposed to Crest&#x27;s stannous flouride in their Pro-Health line, which can cause staining of teeth and potentially sloughing of the gums...  gross.  Colgate also holds a patent on the use of triclosan, an antibacterial and antifungal compound, in toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste but I wish it was bigger</li>
    <li> Colgate is what. the dentist  is the best to use .So i have been using for a long time  good price</li>
    <li> Better than most of my previous toothpaste.</li>
    <li> As expected in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Has been used! Very good toothpaste</li>
    <li> Brushing your teeth is essentially a person&#x27;s way of telling the world &amp;#34;I tried today.&amp;#34; So buy some toothpaste, brush your teeth, and at least look like you are making an effort with your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for making a toothpaste review so deep.</li>
    <li> This product is everything you would expect from a normal Colgate toothpaste product.  The packaging was very easy to open.</li>
    <li> This Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste Twin Pack is convenient and a great price. Not only was this delivered directly to my door in less than two days (amazon prime), which saved me the trouble of having travel to the nearest drug store, but I also saved close to three dollars. Instead of buying toothpaste from my local CVS at 3.70 apiece, I am getting the same product for 2.50! Well worth it!</li>
    <li> Stopped doing the subscribe and save due to price and lack of other available products to get discount</li>
    <li> This toothpaste makes my gums feel healthy and my mouth feels fresh.  No after taste no residual stickiness. Just fresh feel.</li>
    <li> I use many different toothpastes, and among them there is always this one from Colgate even if sincerely I have never seen any improvement on my tooth in terms of whitening. Anyway, i try to not use this product for a long time because it is pretty bad for the gums even if it is not as bad as the whitening kit products. Believe me you do not want to have any gum surgery or loose you teeth at 40 just to look like your inaccessible favorite star.</li>
    <li> Makes a difference with continued use.</li>
    <li> I always have liked the total</li>
    <li> I like it because it makes u feel&lt;br /&gt;That you really  have clean your teeth&lt;br /&gt;Classics brand never fails&lt;br /&gt;And new presentation you not waste product</li>
    <li> not the best; seams kind of cheap....prefer to use the more natural, organic type. not a bad price on amazon if you s and save</li>
</ol>
