      <li>Could be better</li>
      <li>It take 4 sprays to be able to get an idea of what the flavor is.  </li>
      <li>must have if you dance Argentine tango :)</li>
      <li>They sent me Spearmint sugar free!</li>
      <li>Just love this item and</li>
      <li>Taste is also better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I could get it in a six pack.  </li>
      <li>the fact that I was able to purchase six at one time is convenient.  </li>
      <li>So glad I could find it again</li>
      <li>I love this breath spray.</li>
      <li>I love the peppermint flavor.</li>
      <li>Like them, will probably order more when I run through this batch.</li>
      <li>Great price, can;t live without my signature Binaca!</li>
      <li>Not as strong as I remember the original, but I still love it!  </li>
      <li>pretty good, it&#x27;s aerosol not a pump I like the taste</li>
      <li>Keep it fresh!!</li>
      <li>Stores and carries easily in the pocket or purse.</li>
      <li>Fine product, fine company.</li>
      <li>but I am ok with it for a quick fix.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get enough of these lol.</li>
      <li>I bought the 6 pack since I can have this readily available to me anywhere</li>
      <li>I purchased Listerine breath spray at a local drug store and am happy with it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable spraying these into my body.  </li>
      <li>Fresh breath:)</li>
      <li>Not too strong, not to weak, but perfect for freshening your breath.</li>
      <li>I recently found it and started using it again and it was just as good a product as i remembered it being.  </li>
      <li>But, overall pleased just to be able to get them.</li>
      <li>The arrived quickly and work well.</li>
      <li>Just a tap or two on the nozzle gives you a minty fresh breath for whatever the occasion.  </li>
      <li>My old standby favorite...</li>
      <li>It has a nice fresh taste and gets rid of any residue from any food or aftertaste you might have and lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>Always a good idea to carry one of these little sprays with you wherever you roam.  </li>
      <li>Binaca was my favorite novelty breath freshener back in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>The first 2 ingredients are SDalcohol and Iso butane which according to Wikipedia, is another word for methylpropane.  </li>
      <li>different one0 will get the right product!!</li>
      <li>I was very upset-</li>
      <li>It really refreshes my breath.</li>
      <li>It shoots a film canister 50 feet with a very loud bang.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this exact product- Peppermint and regular!!</li>
      <li>can Binaca contains alcohol for germ killing, and doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth sticky sweet like other breath freshners do.</li>
      <li>This way I have extras available to give to friends as these little metal spray  can</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still the same, I like it just as much.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;ve got enough to last me awhile, and the 6-pack made it economical.</li>
      <li>use this not only for fresh breath, but for germ killing if I have been in a public place around people who have colds or flu and coughing, to kill the airborn germs I may have breathed in.</li>
      <li>that I don&#x27;t reach in my purse, pull out Binaca and have a little squirt of fresh breath!</li>
      <li>I also use it at the first sign of a sore throat to kill germs, so give extra containers to friends for the same purpose.&lt;br /&gt;The metal</li>
      <li>It is the same old Binaca aerosol I use as fuel for my Piezeo-poppers.  </li>
      <li>Same old stuff.</li>
      <li>Would have rated higher if not for half the order being duds.</li>
      <li>I should have been suspicious because the first photo is of a blue package and the second was green.  </li>

<li> I am taking a medication that leaves a horrible, metalic taste in my mouth and was desperate to find relief from this side effect.  </li>

    <li> Purchased these in the  pack quantity as everyone is always after my Binaca!  This way I have extras available to give to friends as these little metal spray  can Binaca are difficult to find at our local drugstores, plus the price here on Amazon is about 33% less than it is locally.&lt;br /&gt;I use this not only for fresh breath, but for germ killing if I have been in a public place around people who have colds or flu and coughing, to kill the airborn germs I may have breathed in. I also use it at the first sign of a sore throat to kill germs, so give extra containers to friends for the same purpose.&lt;br /&gt;The metal can Binaca contains alcohol for germ killing, and doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth sticky sweet like other breath freshners do.</li>
    <li> My old standby favorite... best spray ever... keep in my purse, glove compartment, everywhere around the house!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this *anywhere* locally, so I was stoked to see that I could buy it on Amazon. Now I&#x27;ve got enough to last me awhile, and the 6-pack made it economical.</li>
    <li> Used these as stocking stuffers for my husband at Christmas.  He loves these.</li>
    <li> Very low level of taste, takes about 5 sprays to equal what other similar sprays offer with one spray. Stores and carries easily in the pocket or purse.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I remember the original, but I still love it!  The pressurized sprays are still better than the pump versions...same amount per unit, but much more refreshing!</li>
    <li> Container is way cleaner then Scope. Taste is also better. Negative is : the shipping costs.It would be easier if you could get them in a local store !! I can not find them here in Colorado.</li>
    <li> Good price. Prompt delivery. As described. Fresh breath:)</li>
    <li> must have if you dance Argentine tango :)</li>
    <li> I was very upset- I ordered this exact product- Peppermint and regular!! They sent me Spearmint sugar free! I got a refund- but now I am afraid to try and order again. they are for my husband-he hates spearmint as well as sugar free! Cross my fingers when i try to order it again- different one0 will get the right product!!</li>
    <li> Promptly delivered, and exactly as expected!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it lasts long enough. Could be better but I am ok with it for a quick fix. Will buy it again though</li>
    <li> Binaca was my favorite novelty breath freshener back in the 90&#x27;s. Maybe I liked it because it burned and tingled, who knows. It&#x27;s still the same, I like it just as much. Only had one issue with this order... only 3 of the 6 that I recieved worked. The 3 that didnt work had the fluid in them, just no gas to propel it out. Was kinda bummed. Would have rated higher if not for half the order being duds.</li>
    <li> Well what can you say about Binaca that has not already been said. Delivered and it works. Same old stuff. Yeah.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  It is the same old Binaca aerosol I use as fuel for my Piezeo-poppers.  It shoots a film canister 50 feet with a very loud bang.  Or shoot a marshmallow even further with just one shot of the Binaca.</li>
    <li> Excellent breath spray. I love the peppermint flavor. I&#x27;m glad I could get it in a six pack.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I also received Spearmint instead of Peppermint.  I hate Spearmint and was upset because my order clearly states Peppermint and it also showed Peppermint on the picture.  I should have been suspicious because the first photo is of a blue package and the second was green.  If you are ordering this item don&#x27;t expect Peppermint!</li>
    <li> Stating using benica when I quit smoking because of the taste in my mouth.  That was oin 1984 and I am still&lt;br /&gt;using it.  Feel naked without a benaca in my pocket.</li>
    <li> Binaca is Binaca -  price should be lower, but product certainly effective -</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of these lol. They are usually about $3 per one if bought anywhere else. This is a money (and breath) saver. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product! So glad I could find it again😁</li>
    <li> These are great to stash around the house, car and purse, pocket just in case you need to help your breath out without a toothbrush. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> pretty good, it&#x27;s aerosol not a pump I like the taste</li>
    <li> i will definitely purchase this product from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a long time. I like it very much. It really refreshes my breath.</li>
    <li> Like them, will probably order more when I run through this batch. Kids like them too. Nice minty blast when you need it.</li>
    <li> I had used this product years ago and had misplaced it at some point.  I recently found it and started using it again and it was just as good a product as i remembered it being.  I am taking a medication that leaves a horrible, metalic taste in my mouth and was desperate to find relief from this side effect.  When I found this in my drawer I decided to try this with the hopes that it would take away this taste in my mouth.  It works great and tastes great.  It has a nice fresh taste and gets rid of any residue from any food or aftertaste you might have and lasts a long time.  I bought the 6 pack since I can have this readily available to me anywhere i might be.  I leave one in my purse, 1 in the kitchen, 1 in the car, 1 in my travel case. etc.  This is a great value and a great product and recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Its the best treatment for a sore throat that I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Great price, can;t live without my signature Binaca!</li>
    <li> The arrived quickly and work well. They came as a six-pack.  I keep one of them in each car to avoid the possible garbage breath.  Good price.  Good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Will always re-order as needed. Fine product, fine company.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why these have gotten so hard to find in stores. The are the best as far as I am concerned. I would give them 5 stars, but I think they are a little overpriced. But, overall pleased just to be able to get them.</li>
    <li> Product is very weak.  It take 4 sprays to be able to get an idea of what the flavor is.  The first 2 ingredients are SDalcohol and Iso butane which according to Wikipedia, is another word for methylpropane.  I don&#x27;t feel comfortable spraying these into my body.  I gave away 4 of them and threw away the rest.  Buyer beware.  I purchased Listerine breath spray at a local drug store and am happy with it.</li>
    <li> My favorite breath spray!</li>
    <li> Always a good idea to carry one of these little sprays with you wherever you roam.  Just a tap or two on the nozzle gives you a minty fresh breath for whatever the occasion.  Slips into a pocket or brief case or your console...  Keep it fresh!!</li>
    <li> Not too strong, not to weak, but perfect for freshening your breath.</li>
    <li> This product is very hard to find in local stores.  It&#x27;s handy to carry, works well.  Was happy to find it on line.</li>
    <li> Just love this item and the fact that I was able to purchase six at one time is convenient.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> Not a day goes by that I don&#x27;t reach in my purse, pull out Binaca and have a little squirt of fresh breath!</li>
    <li> I love this breath spray. Cannot be without it!</li>
    <li> Nice to find this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find Binaca anymore in stores.  So I was very glad to see I could get these products on line..</li>
