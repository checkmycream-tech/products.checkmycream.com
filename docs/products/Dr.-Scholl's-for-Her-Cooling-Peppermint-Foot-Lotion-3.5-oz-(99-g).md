### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!!!</li>
      <li>This product works great.  </li>
      <li>He used it on his feet and was able to stop taking pain pills!!</li>
      <li>The person I bought this for loved it.  </li>
      <li>I was worried I wouldnt be able to keep up with the training.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s thing and all is better.  </li>
      <li>It always makes my legs and or feet feel better.  </li>
      <li>IT WAS ONE OF THE BETTER PRODUCTS I&#x27;VE EVER USED.</li>
      <li>And the aroma is just one more pleasure when I apply the lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s equally good for us ladies going through menopause and experiencing \\&quot;hot</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion/cream for the last 3 to 4 years and it is just amazing to find a product that truly does what it says on the label!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I am no longer able to find it in grocery or drug stores .  </li>
      <li>I have early Neuropathy in my feet, and this is the most soothing, refreshing foot lotion that I have found that eases the burning and aching of my feet when I have done a lot of walking.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate the company&#x27;s willingness to make it right.</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t use it beyond that time, the iching starts, apply this cream and it stops almost immediately but certainly within an hour or so.</li>
      <li>My husband stands on concrete all day at work.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the rest of my body is hot or not (which, actually, the rest of my body is usually a normal temperature).  </li>
      <li>My feet get hot at night and it has gotten to the point that even sticking them outside of the covers does not help.  </li>
      <li>Causes a bit of a mess when you use it, but, it smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>I figure this must be old stock.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;zip&amp;#34; that my previous purchases (from local store) had - product was a little runny and the mint effect wasn&#x27;t strong.  </li>

    <li> The person I bought this for loved it.  He used it on his feet and was able to stop taking pain pills!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion/cream for the last 3 to 4 years and it is just amazing to find a product that truly does what it says on the label! It&#x27;s equally good for us ladies going through menopause and experiencing \\&quot;hot flashes\\&quot; ask any woman in her 50&#x27;s how miserable they can make you feel, even if it&#x27;s freezing outside.&lt;br /&gt;A small dollop massaged into the face and throat makes a world of difference when hot flashes are driving you crazy.</li>
    <li> As I expected. It&#x27;s slightly runny... Causes a bit of a mess when you use it, but, it smells fantastic. Also, the photo says it&#x27;s a seven pack. I received one from the seller. Questionable. I think so.</li>
    <li> Ordered this a few times now over the past few months. My girlfriend loves loves loves this especially if I&#x27;m rubbing her feet!</li>
    <li> My feet often burn, itch, and irritate me. But the Peppermint foot lotion makes me feel less irritated and makes my feet feel softer. And the aroma is just one more pleasure when I apply the lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the hospitality industry.  I&#x27;m over 60. This lotion really works to keep my feet more relaxed, and less painful.  It keeeps the skin soft without making my feet vulnerable to blistering.  In the summer I can sleep because my feet aren&#x27;t waking me up because they&#x27;re burning.</li>
    <li> I have early Neuropathy in my feet, and this is the most soothing, refreshing foot lotion that I have found that eases the burning and aching of my feet when I have done a lot of walking.  Unfortunately, I am no longer able to find it in grocery or drug stores .  I hope they are not discontinuing this product, as I have tried others and they do not compare.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  However, this company is selling ONE tube for this price.  When I received my one tube (I was expecting a 6-pack), I called and was given a $42.00 refund.  The product is very hard to find now (possibly out of production?), but this price is outragious!  I appreciate the company&#x27;s willingness to make it right.</li>
    <li> My feet get hot at night and it has gotten to the point that even sticking them outside of the covers does not help.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if the rest of my body is hot or not (which, actually, the rest of my body is usually a normal temperature).  My feet just feel like they are on fire.  This lotion is called \\&quot;For Her COOLING Peppermint Foot Lotion.\\&quot;  It does not cool - AT ALL.  It reaks of peppermint (which I hate, but was going to suffer through if it helped my feet), but it does not cool.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Occasionally, I&#x27;ll struggle with the circulation in my legs - put a coat of this on and let it do it&#x27;s thing and all is better.  I&#x27;ve also shared this with my mom and sisters, who all face similar struggles - we all keep a tube in our over night bags and on our nightstands now.</li>
    <li> My husband stands on concrete all day at work. The only thing that relaxes and cools his feet is this product. Hint, I keep it in the fridge for extra coolness.</li>
    <li> Im training for the 3Day Walk for the Cure. Walking about 30 miles a week, my arch and achilles tendon started to bother me. I was worried I wouldnt be able to keep up with the training. I started massaging my feet and achilles with the Peppermint cream twice a day. It worked! No more pain.</li>
    <li> I WISH THEY WOULD BRING THIS BACK ON THE MARKET. IT WAS ONE OF THE BETTER PRODUCTS I&#x27;VE EVER USED.</li>
    <li> I wish Dr. Scholl&#x27;s still made this product!  Works well for soothing tired feet really does.  Please bring it back.</li>
    <li> I used this product all the time till you took it out of the stores. My feet burned and hurt all nite. The only way I could sleep was to use this. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long, long time.  I came about it as a result of my doctor.  I had itching of my lower legs in the middle of the night.  I thought it as a result of the soap I used in the shower and/or washer.  Changed, no help.  I tried a number of the advertised creams to stop itching; nothing would work.  Doctor thinks the peppermint may be the catalist that makes the iching go away.  After several years, this product works, so long as I use it about every 3/4 days.  If I don&#x27;t use it beyond that time, the iching starts, apply this cream and it stops almost immediately but certainly within an hour or so.</li>
    <li> Contents too thin. It&#x27;s like water, Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;zip&amp;#34; that my previous purchases (from local store) had - product was a little runny and the mint effect wasn&#x27;t strong.  I figure this must be old stock.</li>
    <li> Too bad they quit making this product!  😢&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring this back as it was the only product that worked for me- and I have tried lots of products.</li>
    <li> This is a must have if you have any type of leg or foot pain.  It always makes my legs and or feet feel better.  I can always sleep after using this lotion at night.</li>
