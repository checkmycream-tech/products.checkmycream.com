      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color although it is slightly more green in the bottle than what is depicted in the picture.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s not what I expected, but still very cute!</li>

      <li>Gorgeous sparkly teal blue color!</li>
      <li>This color is great, but the durability is just not there as it is with some of my other colors.</li>

      <li>I love my gelish system but not all the colors are created equal.</li>

      <li>I have been wearing this the last month and love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this color! It looks like a mermaids tail.  Beautiful and sparkly.  It goes on smoothly and stays on well</li>
    <li> I hope this color never disappears otherwise I will have to buy cases of it. ;) People always think this is a green, it is not. When ya go to the salon and they put it on don&#x27;t panic! Wait till ya go outside and see what an awesome color it truly is. This is a beautiful teal blue and I wear it all the time. :)</li>
    <li> This color definetly needs three coats to look good. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be staying on as well as the other colors. It is very turquise blue and sparkly. I don&#x27;t see a lot of change of color with it. Not quite as special as I expected it to be, but my 9 year old is still enjoying it as expected. I know other reviews said it was very green. We almost didn&#x27;t get it because of that, but ours is undeniably blue. We r thrilled with the gelish in general. FYI- there seems to be some confusion - you use acetone to remove the gelish and alcohol to \\&quot;buff\\&quot; off the tacky feeling after the final top coat.</li>
    <li> Not something I would want to wear all the time, but I do like it!  2-3 coats of this and it is very bright and shimmery.  Most of my younger clients pick this.</li>
    <li> This is a very flashy color all on its own--it looks like a mermaid&#x27;s tail, and is very glittery.  It also looks pretty cool when it&#x27;s layered over a dark color. It&#x27;s certainly flashy, but I don&#x27;t get what the huge deal is with these Aurora colors. They seem to be just really awesome glitter colors (which is fine by me). I posted a picture--three coats.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most amazing nail colors I&#x27;ve used in years!  I absolutely love it!  I can wait to try more of the Gelish Aurora colors!</li>
    <li> This is a dense irredescent glitter that can look blue or green depending on the light.  Covers fully in three coats.  I also have used this over light green and light blue polishes as an accent and it takes on the color underneath it.  Its a great summer color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this color!  This is the teal color that I was hoping Mint Icing would be.  It looks best with three coats, and changes colors in different lighting.  It&#x27;s a bright teal blue in the day light, and a little greener in darker light.</li>
    <li> This is a fun, glitzy polish!  I have gotten several compliments on it and I&#x27;ve only had it on a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Three coats and its the most perfect jewel-tone teal ever! This color doesn&#x27;t require glitter. It can be worn sheer (1-2 coats) or it can be worn dark (3 coasts).</li>
    <li> I covered my nails with three coats, I&#x27;m delighted with the color! Super sparkly, iridescent color, I feel like a mermaid!</li>
    <li> Had trouble initially with bottle leaking but was fine after. Was a gift for a 17 year old and I saw her wearing it a few days later.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a store thinking that color shown on the label was a nice Teal Blusish color.  It is not a clear coat is is tinged green, and after 4 coats it is solid and greenish blue, but definitely more green than anything.    I still love the color vibrant and very very flashy!!!</li>
    <li> More greenish aqua than blue. It sparkles so much if you do 3 coats. I get compliments on this color every day.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, vibrant, bold, sparkly green that reminds me of a mermaids tail. I&#x27;m in LOVE! Gelish is my favorite brand for gel polish, hands down.</li>
    <li> So honestly the name of this color caught my eye -- lol!  So I ordered it and was not disappointed at all!  It&#x27;s a beautiful color and as cool as it&#x27;s name!! ;o)</li>
    <li> The color is not as pictured.  It&#x27;s more of a teal color.  It&#x27;s not what I expected, but still very cute!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing shade of teal/turquoise and has such incredible shine and sparkle, it looks like car paint!&lt;br /&gt;It is my all time favorite color.&lt;br /&gt;You need an extra coat or it will be pretty transparent, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;And you can layer it over other colors and get different effects.  Over black, the sparkles look more greenish.</li>
    <li> Fun color.&lt;br /&gt;Very much what you would expect a mermaid&#x27;s tail to look and glisten like.  They really should have named it Mermaid&#x27;s Tail.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty color. It&#x27;s like a turquoise blue/green that shimmers and reflects different colors in the light. It&#x27;s also glittery. The only problem I had was that it was a bit sheer. I had to use three coats.</li>
    <li> It is pretty green, but looks great.  Just like all the other Gelish products, stays on for weeks.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> The picture does not do this color justice. It is WAY prettier than it shows. It is a sparkly teal color not as dark of shade as shown in the picture. I like it better than the mint icing color because it has a little more green. So pretty. I does look similar to a mermaid tail that a few others have described it as. I have been wearing this the last month and love it. It is my new favorite color!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant on this color because I don&#x27;t typically wear blues and greens, but this eye catching color changed my mind. Others have described it like a mermaid and I would go along with that description. My sister, who also doesn&#x27;t do blues or greens, had me do her nails with this color after she saw it on me.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with polish.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful, fairly sheer, glitter polish. To get the coverage I wanted I needed to do three coats, and I probably could have done a fourth for good measure. The color ends up looking like a bright teal. This color really draws attention and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it! I can&#x27;t wait to see what this color looks like over a darker Gelish polish.</li>
    <li> I love this color as a topper or alone.  It is really a great teal type color.  My daughter loves this and we use it frequently.  Work great, no issues and stays on well.</li>
    <li> This product got here faster than I thought it would! It&#x27;s a beautiful color although it is slightly more green in the bottle than what is depicted in the picture. The bottle was a bit scraped up so that was a bit of a let down considering it is a gift but I am okay with it. Overall it was a great choice and I can&#x27;t wait to see what she thinks of it!&lt;br /&gt;- Jess</li>
    <li> Another Gelish Favorite! This blue color is wonderful with it&#x27;s holographic greens. Love the bright fun color and the quality of the Gelish brand!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite gel colors for summer!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this nail polish because the color displayed was not the actual color of the product I got.</li>
    <li> If you are an ocean person or just love a shiny teal - marine blue this color is for you.  It&#x27;s gorgeous and lasts equally as long as all the other gelish products.  So far I think this is one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> It is  a mermaid color and has glitter. Very pretty and and flashy. You will need a few coats to have it stand out.</li>
    <li> The color of this polish turned out to look a lot like the picture, but maybe a little lighter. I used two thin coats of the polish and it looks very pretty. This polish is very shimmery and kind of reminds me of a tropical ocean. I am overall very pleased with the color.</li>
    <li> Ooca Coocha Bing Bang Bam is a beautiful color! After 2 coats it&#x27;s a perfect sparkly teal color. Great for summer and fall!</li>
    <li> This was the first gel polish that I had ever purchased.  It is the most awesome color ever.  I got stopped every where I went by women asking what kind of polish it was and where did I get it done.  It is like a shimmery teal, but there&#x27;s something else about it.  It is just a fantastic color.  I definitely recommend it!  It goes on smooth and looks best with two to three thin coats.  This color and this brand started my gel polish addiction.  Gelish is in my opinion the best gel polish.  It lasts at least two weeks and goes on so easily.</li>
    <li> I gifted this to a friend who absolutely loves the color. Its bright and beautiful and it looks great on her nails!</li>
    <li> Awesome color!  Gelish polishes are wonderful, do not clump, goes on smoothly!  Would recommend to anyone wanting to have their nails done at home, inexpensively.</li>
    <li> I got this color based on reviews and I cannot say that I am disappointed. The color is perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> The Color is great. I love the sparkle sparkle! It does need 3 or more coats to look its best.</li>
    <li> The picture does NOT do the color justice! It is SO SPARKLY! I love glitter so I guess if you don&#x27;t like glitter then don&#x27;t get this color.  I like to put this over the top of the color &#x27;Garden Teal Party&#x27; and it just strengthens the tealy colors of both polishes! Gelish is amazing!</li>
    <li> A great shade of teal with so much sparkle your nails will catch everyone&#x27;s eye!  Two coats was plenty for good coverage, a third made the color just a bit deeper and even more sparkly!</li>
    <li> Of all the colors I own, this one gets the most compliments.  This color is a BLUE, very bright and glittery.  I&#x27;m including \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; polish in that category too, since that&#x27;s always on my feet.  This is bright and shiny and doesn&#x27;t seem to dull at all.  I&#x27;ve had it on for 2 weeks without chips (which I&#x27;ve found to be typical of all Gelish colors) and there is no visible fading or dulling of the finish.  The polish could have lasted longer, my nails just grew out.</li>
    <li> I just came back from getting my nails done with this nail polish &amp; came onto amazon hoping to buy it as well as a few other colors. When she put the first layer on I was a little disappointed and thought maybe I chose the wrong color, and then she put two more coats on and a clear coat and I LOVE my nails. if you love mint/teal like I do, you wont be disappointed &#x3D;).</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I are wearing this polish! Just the right amount of sparkle.  The color is somewhere between blue and green; a little bit more green. Remember to put light coats of polish on. Otherwise, some of the glitter can stick out at the tip of the nail. Very pretty.</li>
    <li> I love my gelish system but not all the colors are created equal. This color is great, but the durability is just not there as it is with some of my other colors. This color will start chipping within a day or two whereas some of my more durable colors will last 2-3 weeks!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous sparkly teal blue color!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as described. I love this color and have gotten many compliments. Many say it looks like \\&quot;rockstar\\&quot; glitter polish.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite color from the entire Aurora line, and I do not usually prefer blues.  This is a bright robin&#x27;s egg blue with a hint of green, and it is intensely sparkly.  Unlike some of the other Aurora colors, this color can easily stand alone, but it looks great when one layer is applied over other blues, greens, and white.  This is a very versatile and unique color.  It is a must-have!</li>
    <li> This color is more of a greenish bluish than it is the other way around. It reminds me of a mermaids tail. Very shimmery when it catches the light. Took me about 3 coats to get the color I wanted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute color, I like it.. Like the other reviewers said, the color looks kind of like a mermaid tail.</li>
    <li> So i seriously love this color way more than I thought I would. The picture window shown is definitely not accurate. It is nowhere even close to that dark. It&#x27;s a nice bright turquoise blue. I mainly got it because I do my friends&#x27; nails and one was requesting a blue so this is what I got. But now I currently have it on and even after a week I still love it. Easy application. It does take about three coats to make a good solid sparkly turquoise, but if you do it right and keep the coats thin, then you wont feel like you have a big glob on your nails.</li>
