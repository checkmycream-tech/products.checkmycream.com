      <li>Combine with baking soda, citric acid, corn starch, Epsom salt, and essential oil to create a fizzing bath bomb (great for gifting!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>the end result is really quite amazing.</li>
      <li>It is a good moisturizer and makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>

      <li>I have never had to use much, it spreads very easily.</li>
      <li>have used it as a deep hair conditioner with great success though.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about it for a long time, but honestly didn&#x27;t really know what it was.</li>
      <li>Castor oil to me always reminds me of pregnant woman wanting to go into labor.</li>
      <li>The most successful preparation had been colloidal silver spray which usually controlled the condition but couldn&#x27;t seem to cure it.</li>

      <li>It even FEELS like a normal, healthy scalp with no bumps or scaling.  </li>

      <li>It is a quick absorbing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily residue.</li>

      <li>My favorite thing about this product is that it is a 100% satisfaction guaranteed or your money back, no questions asked.</li>
      <li>Glad it came with an extra cap as well.</li>
      <li>Instead of rinsing my hair out, I add more castor oil to the rest of my hair (extra on the ends) and tie into a bun over night.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>very nice thick castor oil</li>
      <li>Perhaps the oil is able to penetrate the skin enough to reach the infected follicles and really stop this condition.  </li>
      <li>The first night, I used too much and pretty much saturated my hair.  </li>
      <li>I poured Pure Body Naturals Castor oil onto my scalp and massaged it.</li>
      <li>When I received my Castor Oil from Pure Body Naturals</li>
      <li>and I trust Pure Body Naturals</li>
      <li>Three applications, and my scalp is completely clear and calm.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I want it to, but who cares?</li>
      <li>It really gets the blood moving.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting scalp folliculitis  for three years.  The most successful preparation had been colloidal silver spray which usually controlled the condition but couldn&#x27;t seem to cure it. I suspect the preparation didn&#x27;t reach the hair follicles very well but did a lot to kill surface bacteria.  Then, I read about possible side effects of colloidal silver and sought an alternative.  Castor Oil for Natural Skin and Hair arrived three days ago.  The first night, I used too much and pretty much saturated my hair.  My folliculitis was in an unusual and painful flareup, though, so I just kept the Castor Oil in overnight.  Yes, this is an oil, so it does feel heavy, especially in summer heat, and has a little odor (the odor is far less unpleasant than some medicated shampoos), but by the next morning, my scalp was smooth, and the problem areas were either going or gone.  On the two subsequent applications, I&#x27;ve used teardrop-sized amounts on my fingertips and massaged the oil thoroughly into my scalp to prevent greasy buildup on my hair.  That&#x27;s working better; a little oil goes a long way.  Three applications, and my scalp is completely clear and calm.  It even FEELS like a normal, healthy scalp with no bumps or scaling.  That weird prickling/itching feeling that signals a new flareup is disappearing, too. I feel a little itching, but there&#x27;s nothing there!  Perhaps the oil is able to penetrate the skin enough to reach the infected follicles and really stop this condition.  I don&#x27;t know yet if Castor Oil will cure the infection or just contain it, but it was so shockingly effective, I wanted to comment right away.</li>
    <li> **product discounted in exchange for an honest and unbiased review**  My skin is so soft and kissable using this castor oil as a moisturizer after getting out of the shower.  Even my husband and kids noticed a difference , its a glow of my skin.  Usually when I wear any denim I itch so bad after i either put my clothes on or take them off but since I keep my body oiled with this castor oil the excessive itching has stopped.  A part of my excessive itching is because I have an autoimmune disease called scleroderma and there is not much the doctors can do about me itching but I am telling you guys, i swear by this ...I will be even willing to show you before and after photos, THIS CASTOR OIL HELPS WITH MY SKIN AND STOPS THE ITCHING.</li>
    <li> When I received my Castor Oil from Pure Body Naturals I was AMAZED at how HUGE the bottle was! Normally I receive pretty big sized products, 4oz, 6oz..BUT this bottle was a whopping 16 OZ bottle!! I am so happy that it came with a lid to twist on making it easier to pour decreasing any mess.  I always appreciate that Pure Body Naturals is organic and natural ingredients. This Castor Oil is 100% pure and was extracted without any hexane like other castor oils. All natural. Love it.  I initially got this product for my hair because I am always looking for products to help grow my hair out. I poured Pure Body Naturals Castor oil onto my scalp and massaged it. I tried the inversion method by bending upside down for 4 minutes while massaging my scalp to stimulate growth. Instead of rinsing my hair out, I add more castor oil to the rest of my hair (extra on the ends) and tie into a bun over night. In the morning, I rinse and shampoo as normal. Since I have used this Castor oil on my hair, I have notice it growing (for awhile my hair would NOT grow after I had cancer. It hit a plateau length.) and I have noticed a healthier appearance. I have very happy with my hair as the castor oil promotes healthy hair.  I also used this Castor oil on my skin to eliminate and lighten up stretch marks. I see a slight difference so far. My stretch marks on my belly due to childbirth are not as red as they used to be. Love it. I also like that when applying castor oil, it does not leave a greasy or oil feel. It is quickly absorbed into my skin.  My favorite thing about this product is that it is a 100% satisfaction guaranteed or your money back, no questions asked. That is how confident they are. I trust this product and I trust Pure Body Naturals :)  I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review. I am satisfied. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast! Product as described. Glad it came with an extra cap as well. I got this castor oil because of all the great reviews on it. I am trying to get my eyebrows to be more thicker than what they already are, so this I why I chose to get castor oil. I am primarily going to be using it for this reason. Thanks for the A++ shipping😊</li>
    <li> I love this brand of castor oil. It&#x27;s great on my hair and body. I add it to skin products for added moisture on my skin. Castor oil is also great on feet before bed. Put it on your feet then put on a pair of socks. Your feet will be soft and moisturized in the morning. It&#x27;s odorless and comes with an esy to apply flip lid. I was given this bottle of castor oil in exchange for an honest review on how well it works.</li>
    <li> Shawn H.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was amozing. I love the feel of what it does to my skin and how it has no harsh chemicals. When I put it on, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy because it asorbs really fast. Also, since i started using it, i dont have much dandruff nor does my head each anymore. Another thing is, it healed a scar on my arm that really stood out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Heal Scars&lt;br /&gt;2. Reduces Dandruff&lt;br /&gt;3. Better quality Hair&lt;br /&gt;4. Fast-absorbing for non-greasy feel&lt;br /&gt;5. Soft skin and hair&lt;br /&gt;6. Stops head itch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend to buy this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only done it once, but it made my hair very very oily and looking very greasy.</li>
    <li> I only knew that castor oil was for making me throw up as a kid. If i was sick my mom or dad would give me castor oil or cod liver oil.  Hated both.  I started seeing many people saying it was great for your skin.  I was so skeptical.  I remember it being a real strong foul smelling liquid from my childhood.  WRONG.  This oil has a very light scent.  It is rather light  and comes with a flip top pour cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research I found out that  ring work can help/heal&lt;br /&gt;Ringworm&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles and Fine Lines&lt;br /&gt;Acne&lt;br /&gt;Moisturiser&lt;br /&gt;Fade Scars&lt;br /&gt;Stretch Marks&lt;br /&gt;Antimicrobial&lt;br /&gt;Promotes Hair Growth&lt;br /&gt;Thickens Eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;Treats Scalp Infection&lt;br /&gt;Arthritis and Joint Pains&lt;br /&gt;I use it for  my skin.  You can add it to your moisturizer .  I have changed my view of castor oil.  If I use this on my legs I dont have to moisturize for another 2 days. Give it a try it will change your view also!  I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews I was curious and had to order this product. The price was very reasonsible so I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose, I use the product on my entire body and I was so shocked that it did not leave a greasy oily fill unlike products such as baby oil, my feet felt soft all day long and never became ashy (that&#x27;s a first). Since I&#x27;m African American applying any type of oil can weigh our texture of hair down instead of using the product as instructed I&#x27;m going to try adding a capful to my conditioner and massage into my scalp then sit under a dryer and allow it to absorb through out my hair, then I&#x27;ll wash it out, so stay tuned I&#x27;ll let the readers know how that works. So far with just 1 day of use I&#x27;m impressed..</li>
    <li> Love it. Provides moisture for my hair.  After shampoo and conditioner, I apply a quarter size to my VERY curly hair.  I wrap my hair into a bun and let it soak in the oil.  This oil and a combination of Biotin have lengthened my hair.</li>
    <li> I make caster oil packs every time i&#x27;m on my period.  Sometimes its the only thing that can relieve my pain (yes advil and asprin don&#x27;t do much for me when it comes to Endometriosis).  I take a piece of Flannel, pour on some caster oil, lay it on my lower abdomen, cover it with Saran wrap to keep in place, and place a heating pad on top.  You will feel so much relief.  It really gets the blood moving.  It also makes a great carrier oil if you want to add something in your pack like lavender for the swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: I was given a discount on this product for my opinion and review.  However, my opinion is still all my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using castor oil since I was a kid. I use it for hair treatment and mix it with other oils such as coconut oil, almond oil and jasmine oil. Then warm this mixture for 10 seconds in microwave and apply generously to my hair. I leave it on for the night and then take a full head bath the next day. It is a good moisturizer and makes my hair soft and shiny. Not to mention strong. I like the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received at discounted rate in exchange of honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Great for oil cleansing! Love</li>
    <li> Love the bottle cap makes it easier to apply the oil.  I use it on skin, hair, and eyelashes.  I have noticed a difference in the length of my lashes and they appear to be a little thicker.  Will definitely purchase again, shipment was quick.</li>
    <li> Love this .. Hope it&#x27;s around a long time ..</li>
    <li> This stuff I&#x27;ve been looking for everywhere where I live it&#x27;s hard to find and I was lucky to get to review this to try it.  It really makes my skin feel soft and my boyfriend put this on his face to help his beard growing it really helps.  Definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Castor oil is something that I use quite frequently around my home, We use it for so many things. We naturally use it for the most popular reason people get castor oil, our hair. We use it for dry scalp which four out of the five us in my home suffer from. I used it for my children when that had cradle cap as babies and it works great for that. I also use it for dry itchy skin in the winter time. It has anti-fungal and antibacterial benefits which is something that first attracted me to castor oil. I have used it as a lubricant for scissors, to help repair split ends on my hair, in place of chapstick, as a massage oil, I have used it on my nails and my daughter even uses it to help with her acne. There is just so much we use it for on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular brand is a great one. It absorbs well. It comes in a bottle that is going to last for a long time since with castor oil I have never had to use much, it spreads very easily. I love the flip top lid that comes with it. It makes it very easy to get the oil directly where your aiming for without making a mess with it. The oil is cold pressed and is the same consistency of other castor oils I have used. I am happy with this brand and will use it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.

    <li> SO.. I was looking for a extra-heavy-duty-super-awesome lotion because in the summer time.. I can take silk cloth and have it &#x27;catch&#x27; on the dry skin of my arms.  wow.  I saw how many people had put 5 stars on this product and thought I would give it a try.  This product is BETTER than advertised.  After just two days of usage... my arms are in much better shape.  This doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I want it to, but who cares? the end result is really quite amazing.</li>
    <li> Been using on eyebrows and eyelashes several times a week for 3 weeks and have noticeable difference in the growth of my eyebrows, even in some of the spots previously over plucked that saw little growth. Amazing results in my skin after using overnight as well. Great natural product.</li>
    <li> I just starting using this product. So far it does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;It has any uses.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review after i have used to more</li>
    <li> Pure Body Naturals Castor Oil is an awesome oil and I am happy that I have the opportunity to use and review it It is a clear and golden oil. It is a quick absorbing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily residue. Castor Oil is a carrier oil which means it can be mixed with lighter oils in DIY recipes. It is cold pressed and 100% pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is the main reason I wanted to try this Castor Oil. It encourages hair growth by increasing circulation. Castor Oil has anti-fungal and antibacterial properties so it can be used to treat dandruff and scalp infections. I add this Castor Oil to my shampoo and conditioners to make them thicker and increase the moisture retention. also use it as a pre-shampoo or pre-poo hot oil treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can  also be used to treat acne, moisturize dry skin and even skin pigmentation. It may help fade scars and decrease wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the bottle is transparent and I can see the oil. It came with a screw on cap and a flip cap. I use the flip cap which makes it easier to dispense. has been cold-pressed to preserve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. My opinions are my own and this is my experience with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!! I use this All over from my Hair to feet, it is very this thick so a little go a long way it keeps me very moisterized</li>
    <li> Castor oil to me always reminds me of pregnant woman wanting to go into labor. But what it is really good for in my opinion is a bad sunburn. I think it works just as well as aloe vera does. Plus it keeps the skin from peeling and prevents scar tissue and damage.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it for acne it says, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it as a deep hair conditioner with great success though. Castor oil has tons of uses and with this HUGE bottle you can try them all.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discounted price on this product to review it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this Castor Oil! I&#x27;ve grown up hearing all about the medicinal uses of castor oil, and didn&#x27;t realize it had so many other uses! It not only smells great, but it comes with a free flip cap for easy use. I&#x27;m currently using this oil on my stretch marks, as well as a facial moisturizer AND a hair treatment. You can&#x27;t beat getting one product that you can use for so many purposes :-)</li>
    <li> very nice thick castor oil i used a lil in my shampoo bottle for my hair and used out of bottle on skin,no irritation and skin n hairs both soft.received a promotion for this item for my review</li>
    <li> I use this oil for EVERYTHING and the price for a bottle this size is fantastic.  t&#x27;s also cold-pressed, which is the ultimate final word in extracting oil without degrading the ingredients or refining them in any way (so they don&#x27;t lose their naturally beneficial properties).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and wanted to share a few ways I like to use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face wash/makeup remover: I use this (try mixing with olive oil to loosen it up) as a makeup remover for stubborn items.  I also (about once a week during winter months)  use it (with olive oil or grapeseed) as a face wash- literally just rub about 1/2 teaspoon of the product in your hands and apply to your face in a circular motion for a minute or two, then gently remove from your face with a very warm damp washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair care: Add 2 tablespoons to your favorite cheapie conditioner to amp up the moisturizing properties.  Massage your scalp with castor oil to increase blood circulation and growth.  For curly hair: In the shower, using the included flip cap, lightly squirt oil on your hair, detangle, then braid under running water to remove the excess oil (it&#x27;s a great way to get frizz-free beach waves). Heat in a water bath, then apply liberally to hair for 15-30 minutes as a hot oil treatment before shampooing.  Add to shampoo or body wash to increase moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body care: Add to your favorite oil butter (e.g. shea butter, cocoa butter, etc.) and whip with a hand mixer for 5 minutes to create a luxurious body butter.  Use alone as a carrier oil for essential oils.  Apply to damp skin after showering to increase moisture.  Use as a cuticle oil during manicure process.  Combine with baking soda, citric acid, corn starch, Epsom salt, and essential oil to create a fizzing bath bomb (great for gifting!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I recommend this product.</li>

    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used castor oil. I&#x27;ve heard good things about it for a long time, but honestly didn&#x27;t really know what it was. I used it on my hair and face and it brought down the inflammation I had going on. I have to say I love it!</li>
