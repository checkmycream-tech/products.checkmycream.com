      <li>I Was a bit scared to try this on my own since I have been going to a nail tech for 2 yrs now</li>
      <li>Nice product</li>
      <li>This is a nice dryer.</li>
      <li>My girls do warn that though the purple glow looks really nice, it can bother the eyes</li>
      <li>I use it every 2-3 weeks to do my own gel manicures at home.</li>
      <li>I have been doing my own gels for 2 years now...</li>
      <li>I love OPI, I love this lamp!</li>
      <li>This has been awesome so far.</li>
      <li>, I was able to do my nails as nice as in the salon.</li>

      <li>PERFECT light for me after much research.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great machine that does exactly what you expect.</li>

      <li>I can not remember specific brands that have given the best results</li>
      <li>It does a great job of setting the polish, it&#x27;s sturdy, and the seller had it to my door lightening fast.</li>
      <li>and I love how compact it is compared to the UV lamp I used to have.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d probably be more confident.  </li>
      <li>If I had more experience</li>
      <li>Anyway, wish I had more info to share.</li>
      <li>Now when u hit the button to turn it on, it flashes like a strobe light and doesn&#x27;t stay on!</li>
      <li>but I do always peek in to make sure my thumb and fingers are positioned just so to make sure each has an assigned bulb.  </li>
      <li>With the 3 of us using it, it has more than already paid for itself, plus you can do it at your convenience.</li>
      <li>I love the size of the opening.  </li>
      <li>MS light is perfect so far...</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice product but it feels hot inside when it&#x27;s curing your nails.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great customer service and product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I really like this lamp. I read every review I could find and finally bought this one. It&#x27;s a great machine that does exactly what you expect. This was my first time doing gel nails and they came out really great. The only thing that I  have issue with is the beep when you set the time and also when the time is up. It&#x27;s similar to the chirp a smoke detector makes when the battery life is low. If you have dogs who are sensitive to this sound just be aware of this.</li>
    <li> First, I received this product free for the purpose of review.  I&#x27;m hoping that my impressions and observations will prove helpful to you in your decision making.  If you have questions, post them in the comments section and I&#x27;ll do my best to answer based on actual experience with the product, as the women in my household are making frequent use of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you&#x27;re getting with this order:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Portable LED nail dryer&lt;br /&gt;(1) Power cord&lt;br /&gt;(1) User&#x27;s Manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is this thing, and what does it do?: This dryer uses 24W LED lights to cure gel nail polish using time increments of 15, 30 or 60 seconds.  Not all polishes are compatible with this particular dryer, so check the product description to see if the product you use will be properly cured.  LED lamps last the entire life of the product so there is no need to change bulbs.  It is advertised as large enough to do an entire hand at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?: Yes.  I have observed several times as my wife and daughters have used the product and it performs exactly as advertised as long as the product being used is on the list of compatible gels. The unit itself is actually quite stylish and is well represented in the product description photos.  It is very simple to use; just plug it in and select one of the 3 time increments. When in use it emits a purple glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything else of note?: As of the posting of this review, the dryer is eligible for free shipping to members of Amazon Prime; always a check in the plus column for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any negatives: None so far.  My girls do warn that though the purple glow looks really nice, it can bother the eyes so they position it lower when they can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This is an attractive dryer that works exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s simple to operate, and is highly portable.  It&#x27;s getting frequent use, and no issues with durability to this point.  I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I got this as a valentine&#x27;s gift! Totally loving it! It&#x27;s fast and you can put all your fingers at once!</li>
    <li> Works very well with different gel polishes. Great purchase and great price</li>
    <li> Love it. But it doesn&#x27;t have fans.</li>
    <li> The best one I owned.  Dry my nails super fast!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work right out the box.</li>
    <li> Just received my melodysusie led lamp and I loooooove it! So far ive used gelish and fingerpaints gel polishes and they have cured perfectly with this lamp! I totally recommend it to anyone. It is at a great price and works amazing!</li>
    <li> Excelente lamp couldn&#x27;t ask for more</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve owned. With 12 lamps around the machine, all my fingers could be cured perfectly, even my thumb and little finger. That&#x27;s amazing because before I needed to do thumbs separately for success, no matter at home or at salon. As described, it came in an elegant gift box, so light. Maybe it&#x27;s possible to carry it when traveling, but it depends. I&#x27;ll try... The beep timer setting helps to save much time, my OPI can be cured for 30 seconds. In my opinion, different gel polish produce different results. I love OPI, I love this lamp!</li>
    <li> I am a nail tech in a salon and got tired of buying $200  UV lights with $40 bulbs all the time, so I thought I&#x27;d give this LED light a try, I&#x27;ve been using it on my clients for a week now and I love it! It cures OPI, gelish and shellac, haven&#x27;t tried anything else yet.</li>
    <li> After purchasing and returning another brand, I went back to looking for an affordable lamp that would get the job done.  I ordered this LED Nail Lamp after extensive research and trust in buyer reviews and I am so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This MelodySusie 24W LED Nail Drying Lamp is EXCELLENT...To test if this , I&#x27;ve used it to cure nail sculpting gel, Gelish brand polish and ASP brand gel nail polish, all cured to a perfect set with that salon perfect shine.&lt;br /&gt;I Love Love Love this item.</li>
    <li> This has been awesome so far. It only takes 30 seconds per coat to fully cure but sometimes I do 60 just to make sure. There&#x27;s no color transfer at all between coats either. I use it with opi gel polish.</li>
    <li> So far its been awesome, I have only used it once but I am happy with purchase! I really hope it ends up lasting me for awhile!!</li>
    <li> Great lamp! Successfully cured Gelish and IBD polishes! Even if I gooped on a thick layer it still cured!</li>
    <li> I have been extremely pleased with my purchase, no problem curing several different gel polish brands.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I just used this lamp with Red Carpet Manicure LED nail system and it was fabulous.  I cured for 60s after each coat, but it seemed like it could have probably been a shorter time.  Perfect size and light weight.  Fits a whole hand (including thumb) or foot.  I did my fingers and toes today.  I would give 5 stars, but this is the first day using it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to purchase a nail dryer and do my own gel nails! Wasted a lot of money paying the salon for something I can do myself. Read many reviews before finally deciding on MelodySusie. Thanks to all the reviewers here on Amazon for your time to review as you helped me to make an excellent purchase! It&#x27;s amazing that the nails dry in 30 sec. * AMAZING! * Have used OPI &amp; Harmony products with it so far with NO PROBLEMS! ABSOLUTELY Delighted With This Purchase!!</li>
    <li> Love this lamp! It works great and easily fits all 5 fingers.</li>
    <li> Love this LED light! I was comparing different lights and decided to buy this one... Glad I did! I use OPI and cure each coat for 30 seconds with my top coat for 60 seconds.</li>
    <li> Works great love it.  Gives you 15, 30 and 6 second options.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the heck out of this thing....but only for her hands.  This gel stuff is hell to get off of your nails, and to take the polish off of her toes involved a whole lot of bending over, repeatedly.  She has since stripped the gel from her toes and just uses regular nail polish for her toes, and the gel for her hands.  Cooks the nails for 90 seconds, and on to the next coat...</li>
    <li> I wanted to do my own nails because I couldn&#x27;t justify going to a salon and spending big money. Researched many gel nail sights and would see MelodySusie referenced a lot. Identified this dryer and it is wonderful. I do base and color coat on 30 seconds and final, top coat for 60 seconds and it works great. Well worth the money for what it will save in having nails professionally done. I do my toes in it and it works out great.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my UV light, it&#x27;s not what they say, you need to hit the light on 3-4 times to help it cure, 60 seconds is not enough with this light.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything more than what everyone else has said.  It works great and I love how compact it is compared to the UV lamp I used to have.  Even with only putting one hand in at a time, it&#x27;s still so much faster to get my nails done.  I&#x27;ve only used gelish polish so far and it cures fast.</li>
    <li> 24W of LED is the bare minimum if you want reliable curing without UV exposure.  I researched for a couple hours and consulted with my daughter before finally deciding on this modal, and after a couple months of use I believe my time was well spent.  I can not remember specific brands that have given the best results but she has been using a brand from Germany and another from Japan and says they&#x27;re very good.  I think they come in small jars like the Carmex Lip-balm.  I also bought her a Chinese knock off of the most popular US brand and she said that worked well too, but the US version I bought wouldn&#x27;t dry right for some reason.  I think it might have been the color/batch or something, who knows.  It was called Ivory Coast, I think.  Anyway, wish I had more info to share.</li>
    <li> AWESOME SERVICE AND LIGHT!</li>
    <li> I love it!  works so well and fast.  Easy to get all fingers inside .  The timing buttons are easy to acess.</li>
    <li> Love this light. Can get my whole hand, thumbs too, in the unit.  I always let the polish stay in there much longer than they suggest as I think it sets it better. No problems with it. It has 15sec. 30sec. &amp; 60sec. choices &amp; beeps when done.  Can hit the button a second time if you want to stop it sooner.  I set up my large breadboard on my lap when doing my nails &amp; it fits nicely.  I like the triangle shape.  My laptop on one side &amp; my MelodySusie light on the other. I get bored so I usually have a show or movie on the computer while doing my nails.  Will never go back to acrylic nails again.  The Gelish system of polish I use stays on for 2 weeks. I am amazed &amp; my nails are so tough with this method.</li>
    <li> Have only used this once, but live the ease and speed!!!</li>
    <li> I love my LED lamp, does the job! My nails have never looked this good...Happy Customer!</li>
    <li> The product did not work well for me.  I was very disappointed. I used the lamp with Shellac and the lamp did not cure completely. Price was great but that is all that I can say. I sent the product back after using twice. I did purchase the CND Led lamp which works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I was using a Mally LED cure lamp but the polish would only last a week at best. I checked and it was only 7 watts so I decided to look for something more powerful. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and especially the price. I applied my first mani and it has lasted a week and still going. I have a few chips but I also do a lot with my hands such as gardening and cleaning.</li>
    <li> its really good, i&#x27;ve been doin nails for couple years and i dont wanna spend too much $$$ for the LED light...MS light is perfect so far...i like it</li>
    <li> It does everything I wanted it to.  It has a 15/30 and 60 second timer on it, can put all fingers and thumb in at one time and cures polish on all.  Two family members and I share it and we are all very pleased with it.  I have had it for about 3 weeks now. The price was right and am so glad I bought it.  With the 3 of us using it, it has more than already paid for itself, plus you can do it at your convenience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent - but five finger cures on more opaque polishes isn&#x27;t really something I recommend.  I get a lot of ripples in the more saturated creme colors (white, black, reds/pinks, even nudes that are very thick and heavy in color).  Still prefer the manufacturer lamps for great manis - but this will do in a pinch I suppose.  --- Update - after posting my review of the product, which I maintain is accurate under ideal product application conditions, I was told perhaps I did not apply correctly.  While the product is at very best &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; - the customer service is offensive.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have done my nails three times so far with this product and it gives me salon level results! I did my research and this is the best quality lamp for the price!</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE it! I am a polish hoarder, as in I have more than every salon I&#x27;ve ever been to. I looked up a few different lamps, checked reviews and watched demo videos and reviews before settling on MelodySuse. I&#x27;m so happy I opted for the 24W as opposed to one of the smaller ones. This is amazing and produces legitimate salon quality manicures. Each layer is fully cured in 30 seconds without a doubt. So far I have tried ASP, Finger Paints and Orly gel polish, as well as a using regular polish sandwiched between gel base and top coats. All work perfectly fine. Super happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I have used this 24W LED a couple of times now with two different nail gel polishes and found it worked great. Just have to watch you don&#x27;t put your hand all the way to the back as it is hot. I would recommend so far, time will tell.</li>
    <li> Quick service &amp; awesome machine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a dinky little LED light for a couple of years now I got from a big box store as a kit. It worked well enough on most gel polishes. When Amazon decided to celebrate with Prime day recently I thought it was time to try a different light just to see if there was a difference. WOW what a difference. I&#x27;m very pleased. My old LED would allow my polish to stay on a week, maybe a week and a half if I kept my hands exceptionally dry. Unfortunately, I work in the medical profession and one day at work washing my hands and I could already see where it was starting to peel up on the sides. In fact that is how I removed my polish, just peeling up what was coming off.&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea gel polish could last a long as this has. I&#x27;m no week THREE! At this point there are not signs of wear or tear. I&#x27;ve cut my nails and actually filled in where my nails have grown out twice over the last three weeks and my polish is still going strong thanks to this light.&lt;br /&gt;Also worth mentioning this light works FAST. You have three preset settings, I generally use the thirty second setting and wow it is fast and accurate. I look forward to many years of use from this fantastic little piece of beauty equipment.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this LED dryer! It arrived in 2 days and was well packaged without any damage. I use it every 2-3 weeks to do my own gel manicures at home. It is easy to use and works better and faster than my UV nail dryer. I store it in the box it came in. I love it! It is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with OPI Gelcolor.</li>
    <li> I love this light! I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It works great. I used gel polish Sensationail that I bought from walmart, did my hands and toes. Everything works perfect so far.  I chose this light out of the others I was looking at because it had the most wattage for LED that I could find for the price. Its simple and easy to use. It got here in time too, great shipping.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. I am very happy with how well it cures in very little time at all. The extra thumb bulbs that point right at them make it so nice that you don&#x27;t have to angle your hand in an awkward hand-cramp inducing angle to properly cure them. The &#x27;beep&#x27; it makes when turned on and to signal the end of the time, does scare my eternally-miss-shakes-a-lot chihuahua... She goes heads for the hills when it beeps. But that is just a side note. Your dog may not be so touchy lol. I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my sister she said it cures gel polish in 30 secs She love it</li>
    <li> This is a nice dryer. This is my first time doing my own gel polish nails but I have been going to the nail salon for a hundred years so between that knowledge and YouTube, I was able to do my nails as nice as in the salon. Actually nicer because I filed them the way I like them. The dryer worked beautifully, very quick and easy. Very happy with this purchase and my decision to stop going to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for one I owned.  My dog was terrified of the long, high pitched beep of the timer so I had to buy a different one.  Am I glad I did!  I love the size of the opening.  I can easily get all my fingers and thumb in there.  I can also get all my toes in, so now I can do them too.  The quick little beep this machine makes doesn&#x27;t bother my dog at all.  For the first time since I started doing gel nails, she wasn&#x27;t hiding down the basement. Besides the timer sound, this machine is well worth the money.  It does a great job of setting the polish, it&#x27;s sturdy, and the seller had it to my door lightening fast. Five stars from me and five tail wags from Brandy.</li>
    <li> Small but efficient! My first lamp. Very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> No more salon manicures for me! After a few trial in error attempts I have mastered a great NO CHIP manicure. Great salon quality lamp!</li>
    <li> Love it, product works great on gel nails......love my nails for the first time without going to salon!!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after two times of using it! The third time was definitely not the charm! Now when u hit the button to turn it on, it flashes like a strobe light and doesn&#x27;t stay on! Of course this happened after the 30 day return period!! Convenient! So so disappointed and I thought this was one of the higher rated ones! I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all! Save ur money and get a more reliable product! Contacting the seller to see if they will honor their product. Will post an update if they do.</li>
    <li> I received my package on time. I used it Friday for my nails and Saturday for my toe nails.  Fits all 5 just like it says. Easy to use timer. Dries OPI gel polish perfectly! ! I Was a bit scared to try this on my own since I have been going to a nail tech for 2 yrs now but I absolutely love it! What a great investment. Will save lots of time and money in the long run.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Has a side light that hits your thumb. Dries Shellac, OPI, Le Chat product with no issue.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me and I absolutely love this!!!!! Recommend 100% the only thing is you can fit two hands in it but very tight and I have small hands, but that does not bother me since I prefer to do one hand at a time and it is perfect for your feet as well!!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I just started using soak off gel at home to provide a layer of protection to peeling nails. My first lamp was included in a kit and  worked relatively well but my thumbs had to be done separately.  I was shopping around for an 18W five finger lamp until I saw a review of this 24W lamp on the Chickettes blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no issues with curing all five nails at once but I do wonder about the absence of a mirrored interior and if such makes this 24W unmirrored setup equal to or more powerful in comparison to an 18W mirrored setup. Perhaps I don&#x27;t need to worry but I do always peek in to make sure my thumb and fingers are positioned just so to make sure each has an assigned bulb.  If I had more experience I&#x27;d probably be more confident.  Even with the double-checking I have no regrets and, because it is touted as 24W, would repurchase.</li>
    <li> WOW!!!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. I have been doing my own gels for 2 years now... And I can&#x27;t believe I wasted SOOO much time with my old UV lamp (120 sec cure time), and wasted SO much money on new bulbs that were constantly burning out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew my old lamp sucked, but I never even tried searching for an LED lamp because I assumed a decent one would $200-$300. Boy was I wrong!!!! This lamp is amazing, words cannot do it justice. 30 seconds is efficient to cure even thick coats without rippling. The thumbs get fully cured every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price either. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is of a portable size and feet and hands for perfectly. The whole gel nail process is able to be performed fast and easy!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! Update: I&#x27;ve owned this for a year now. It is still working flawlessly!</li>
    <li> I use the Shellac brand gel polish.  I was able to do each coat for 30 seconds each and last coat for 60 seconds and it is just fine with the LED lights.  My whole hand goes in just fine as well.  PERFECT light for me after much research.</li>
    <li> Love the design and cool purple glow light, but best of all, it works great!  Love it and highly recommend!!</li>
