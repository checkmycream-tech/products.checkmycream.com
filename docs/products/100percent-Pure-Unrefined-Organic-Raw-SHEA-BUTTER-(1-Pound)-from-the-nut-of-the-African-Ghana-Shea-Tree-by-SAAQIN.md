### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very good product just as advertised</li>
      <li>Great deal and as advertised.</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;ve never bought a lot of these DIY products before, this one worked great for me.</li>
      <li>Because I&#x27;ve read that shea butter is noncomedogenic, I&#x27;ve used it on my face (sparingly), but also liberally on hands and body with great results.</li>
      <li>Love the products I&#x27;ve made with this butter!!</li>
      <li>but I think it is good for what I need it for.</li>
      <li>Good deal for the amount, but beware of the smell because I was not expecting it.</li>
      <li>It dosen&#x27;t have a paticularly good scent</li>
      <li>It does absorb good though.</li>
      <li>It works great but, has a strong odor.</li>
      <li>Those chunks of pure cocoa are delicious and the skin appreciates them!</li>
      <li>Wonderful texture, and feels very high quality.</li>
      <li>Like the cocoa butter, this is also an amazing product.</li>
      <li>Amazing quality.</li>
      <li>Smooth, and made great lotion bars.</li>
      <li>excellent product and ships fast</li>
      <li>Love this shea butter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used organic Shea butter for well over a year to make many products like body butter, lotions &amp; chapsticks.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>, I love the organic quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the pureness of this Organic Shea Butter.</li>
      <li>going to use it to make gifts but will have to buy more somewhere else.</li>
      <li>My husband was apprehensive about me purchasing this product and said non of this works or helps to prevent stretchmarks during pregnancy or to improve skin quality, but he is now using it more than me.</li>
      <li>I do love it for it&#x27;s moisturizing properties, though.</li>
      <li>Great price for such amazing quality.</li>
      <li>This is probably the best discovery I have made for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent for skin made dry by winter weather.  </li>
      <li>Easier to use, for it is so smooth from the container and easy to apply to skin.</li>
      <li>It worked just fine, melted great, but It smelled so offputting to me not only in its container but even after I used it in lipsticks.</li>
      <li>, It was colder when I first received the Shea Butter, and I had to take some out, place in a microwave safe dish and get it to turn to liquid this way.</li>
      <li>If you are in need of a moisture lotion for dried out skin, then this would be perfect as it is 100% pure, and does make skin almost satin feeling.</li>
      <li>The Cocoa butter I purchased is from this same company and it is amazing.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s great because depending on the day I just put a few drops of some aromatherapy oil and it blends right in.</li>
      <li>I do use this product and apply the cocoa butter right ontop.</li>
      <li>I needed it right away for</li>
      <li>It is also unscented, but does make my skin very soft and smooth when I apply it to my skin</li>
      <li>I will try mixing it more with beeswax next...</li>
      <li>I love it and will definitely order this again.</li>
      <li>(I use essential oils to cover the strong smell)</li>
      <li>This is truly unrefined and raw, but it is filtered and super smooth and creamy!</li>
      <li>Also, this &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t penetrate the skin fully like real shea butter is suppose to.  </li>
      <li>Smooth, not gritty, would purchase again.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>It was very nourishing though.</li>
      <li>When I ordered this I expected it to be creamy and easy to spread on skin.  </li>
      <li>It has a distinctive smell, similar to lanolin, that I have not been able to cover up with mixing with coconut oil and essential oils.</li>
      <li>It was very gritty &amp; did not &amp;#34;behave&amp;#34; love all other Shea Butters I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>Except for those with extremely dry skin, it may be too heavy for warm weather.  </li>
      <li>Soft but not  creamy.</li>
      <li>Once he developed infection, he would spend a week or two at the hospital.</li>
      <li>First off, I ordered Ivory and they sent me yellow shea butter; I only realized this after I had opened it!  </li>
      <li>did you open it, it says yellow on the label?&amp;#34; I mainly was looking for an apology and a possible discount next time I purchased from them; I didn&#x27;t get either!&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being sent the wrong product, the yellow has stained many of my son&#x27;s clothes!!!  </li>
      <li>It is somewhat stiff until the heat of your hands transforms it into a workable, rich moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried raw shea butter, and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>My only problem with it is it&#x27;s very compact and has finally softened up</li>
      <li>About a week after we started using the product, his skin no longer looked thin as it used to; and within two weeks to a month his skin looked and stayed healthy.</li>
      <li>He used to itch and scratch continuously; his skin became so thin that the scratching easily cuts his skin and infection sets in and spread all over his body.</li>

<li> Funky smell, but nothing serious.</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve tried all the expensive eczema creams and lotion recommended by the dermatologist but nothing worked.</li>
<li> If you work it and work it, it eventually blends, but I was very disappointed.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Smooth, not gritty, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> excellent product and ships fast</li>
    <li> It really works. Helps dry, chapped skin. Only 4 stars instead of five? The smell can be hard to put up with. It was doctor recommended for dry skin and for any skin problems.</li>
    <li> First off, I ordered Ivory and they sent me yellow shea butter; I only realized this after I had opened it!  I needed it right away for baby&#x27;s skin had broke out in a rash, so I used it anyways. I emailed the company to let them know they made a mistake.  I expressed to them that I didn&#x27;t want to return because I needed it now and didn&#x27;t want to wait for return lag time. Their response was &amp;#34;Why did you open it, it says yellow on the label?&amp;#34; I mainly was looking for an apology and a possible discount next time I purchased from them; I didn&#x27;t get either!&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being sent the wrong product, the yellow has stained many of my son&#x27;s clothes!!!  I did a little more research and realized this product is falsely advertised.  They must put a dye in the product. Also, this &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t penetrate the skin fully like real shea butter is suppose to.  It leaves an oily, greasy feel, even hours of application.  I will never buy this product again!!!!</li>
    <li> Smooth, and made great lotion bars. Might try it for soap next. I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic and unrefined.</li>
    <li> Soft but not  creamy. Has ashy smell to it. That does not bother me. Takes rubbing in to break it down. It does absorb good though. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good product just as advertised, I love the organic quality.&lt;br /&gt; I will purchase it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> It has a distinctive smell, similar to lanolin, that I have not been able to cover up with mixing with coconut oil and essential oils. I will try mixing it more with beeswax next...I do love it for it&#x27;s moisturizing properties, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used organic Shea butter for well over a year to make many products like body butter, lotions &amp; chapsticks.&lt;br /&gt;This Shea Butter was a pure disappointment. It was very gritty &amp; did not &amp;#34;behave&amp;#34; love all other Shea Butters I&#x27;ve used before. Does have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; way about it and does not absorb into the skin well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product from this company &amp; will not be ordering again!&lt;br /&gt;Was going to use it to make gifts but will have to buy more somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in making homemade lipstick. It worked just fine, melted great, but It smelled so offputting to me not only in its container but even after I used it in lipsticks. It was very nourishing though. Good deal for the amount, but beware of the smell because I was not expecting it.</li>

    <li> I never bought it before so I don&#x27;t know how it is supposed to be but I think it is good for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I expected it to be creamy and easy to spread on skin.  What I got was very, very gritty.  If you work it and work it, it eventually blends, but I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love the products I&#x27;ve made with this butter!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for use in the homemade chapsticks that I was going to make.  It was a recommendation on one of the web pages as an ingredient that would be beneficial in helping with chapped lips and hands.</li>
    <li> I use this shea butter to make homemade deodorant. It works great but, has a strong odor. (I use essential oils to cover the strong smell)</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter. Wonderful texture, and feels very high quality.</li>
    <li> My son was born with a severe case of eczema. He used to itch and scratch continuously; his skin became so thin that the scratching easily cuts his skin and infection sets in and spread all over his body. Once he developed infection, he would spend a week or two at the hospital. We&#x27;ve tried all the expensive eczema creams and lotion recommended by the dermatologist but nothing worked. Then I read online how pure organic raw shea butter helped someone with a similar severe case of eczema; I decided to give it a try so I ordered it from Amazon, My wife couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, but because we&#x27;ve tried everything else but nothing works, she decided to put up with the smell if it would help our son&#x27;s severe case of eczema. About a week after we started using the product, his skin no longer looked thin as it used to; and within two weeks to a month his skin looked and stayed healthy. We have been using this product for four years now and since we started using it, he has not been admitted and treated for infection at the hospital as used to happen before we used the shea butter. His itching reduced dramatically and now he hardly itches. For us, the SHEA BUTTER HAS BEEN A LIFE SAVER!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just gotten into making DIY lotions, cleaning products, etc. I use 2 parts of shea butter to 1 part whipped cocoa butter with 1-2 drops of tree tea oil. It&#x27;s a heavy cream that I use on my hands at bedtime. Although I&#x27;ve never bought a lot of these DIY products before, this one worked great for me.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best discovery I have made for my dry skin. It dosen&#x27;t have a paticularly good scent but it&#x27;s great because depending on the day I just put a few drops of some aromatherapy oil and it blends right in. I use it everywhere even on my face.</li>
    <li> I love the pureness of this Organic Shea Butter. My only problem with it is it&#x27;s very compact and has finally softened up, It was colder when I first received the Shea Butter, and I had to take some out, place in a microwave safe dish and get it to turn to liquid this way. It is also unscented, but does make my skin very soft and smooth when I apply it to my skin, It makes my skin feel almost satin like. I just add body spray to give me the scent I like having even with my Shea Butter. If you are in need of a moisture lotion for dried out skin, then this would be perfect as it is 100% pure, and does make skin almost satin feeling.</li>
    <li> oooops, wrote the wrong review prior to this one.   Like the cocoa butter, this is also an amazing product. Easier to use, for it is so smooth from the container and easy to apply to skin. I do use this product and apply the cocoa butter right ontop. Amazing quality. Funky smell, but nothing serious. My husband was apprehensive about me purchasing this product and said non of this works or helps to prevent stretchmarks during pregnancy or to improve skin quality, but he is now using it more than me. He loves it.   The Cocoa butter I purchased is from this same company and it is amazing. Those chunks of pure cocoa are delicious and the skin appreciates them! I recommend these two products.  Great price for such amazing quality.</li>
    <li> Great deal and as advertised.</li>
