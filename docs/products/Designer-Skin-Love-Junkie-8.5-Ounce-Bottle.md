    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of most tanning lotions, but this one is fantastic!  I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I only used it a couple times because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, I didn&#x27;t get any darker either. I ended up giving it to my fiance because the smell reminds me more of something a man would wear. He seems to like it really well and he is getting darker.</li>
    <li> I have used Love Junkie for years and I love it.  We just bought a tanning bed for my home so my daughter could tan.  She has never been able to tan consistantly because we live in a rural area and it is too late to go after i get home.  She has a fair complexion and takes a long time to tan.  She started using the love junkie and looks great.  She has so much more confidence now.  Thank you for offering this product at such a great price.  I usually pay $36. for the same thing in tanning salons.</li>
    <li> I used this product 5 years ago and it is still just as good as it was then. Love Junkie is awesome for acquiring that smooth bronzed natural look of a great tan.</li>
    <li> I was going on a vacation and wanted to get a nice tan going on, so I was recommended this lotion by a friend of mine who worked in a tanning salon.  It works for indoors AND outdoors! fantastic.  I&#x27;ve always been VERY obsessive about SPF, but for once, I wanted to get a bronzey look.  So, I bought this per her recommendation.  I LOVE IT!  I really haven&#x27;t gone out to get a sun tan only before..... And this stuff worked so well.  I didn&#x27;t burn.  It smelled wonderful.  I really am obsessed with the smell and texture of the lotion.  It&#x27;s creamy and feels soft and moisturizing.  The smell changes a tiny bit post sun, but that&#x27;s fine....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it gives me a beautiful golden bronze and the color lasts SO long. The last sunny day I laid outside must have been a week ago, and I only was out for two hours laying beneath sunlight in my yard and I developed beautiful color!  And it&#x27;s still here!  Amazing.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion!  It is non-greasy, very silky feeling, and I definitely get dark using it.  I tan pretty easily, but I would definitely recommend using a lotion in the tanning beds. The smell is like tropical pina colada, but it looks like chocolate pudding coming out of the bottle.  Some of the more expensive ones that have 10x and bronzers I can&#x27;t tell the difference with.  Just use some moisturizer, and this is a good one. Thanks.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t notice a vast improvement in the tanning time using this instead of other lotions, I do appreciate the smell and the fact that I don&#x27;t feel sticky afterward.  There is no chemical smell like with other lotions.  I will continue to use this and feel comfortable recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for YEARS because it always gives me such a natural looking deep tan. Keeps your skin soft and has a nice scent. Highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Need I say more..</li>
    <li> I opened my tanning lotion as soon as I received it. It has been expired for almost a year! I would suggest spending the extra money and buying from the tanning salon so you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting and don&#x27;t have to waste your time with returns/refunds.</li>
    <li> This product is great for fair skin.  Doesn&#x27;t make you orange or turn you suspiciously dark instantly, but gives a great tan over just a few tanning sessions.  Smells great and makes your skin super soft.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!!! One of the best smelliing tanning lotioons out there!!! Its not a tingle lotio, does wor just fine. Would recommend for beginners or someone whos experienced. Great lotioon to  help keep a base tan. Good  consistancy too. not oily or gel like. absorbs well. Good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and works great for indoor tanning. It smells good and leaves my skin soft and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample pack of this at the tanning salon. The very next day I was on Amazon ordering a bottle! Love Junkie is by far the BEST indoor tanning lotion I have used!</li>
    <li> Love junkie gave me a great tan! Not a strong scent, no after tan smell. This lotion was great! Great price!</li>
    <li> When I had first started tanning 3 years ago, I started out with this tanning lotion. I had bought it for over $30 at my salon so Amazon has a great deal ! Good smell and doesn&#x27;t turn me orange or streak. Only downfall from ordering from Amazon was that when I received my product, I noticed it had expired earlier is the year. (2/2013 and it is now 8/2013) I don&#x27;t mind because it doesn&#x27;t affect the lotion (that I&#x27;ve noticed) but the seller should disclaim this. I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s how they sell it for cheap. Other than that, LOVE this lotion !!</li>
    <li> This was the first tanning lotion I used when I starting indoor tanning 3 years ago, but the place I go to didn&#x27;t stock it anymore. I FINALLY got online and purchased some. I love the smell!!!! It also helps tan very well with no streaks, etc. My FAVORITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast shipping! Thanks</li>
    <li> Smells great, really helped me get tan before vacation.  Don&#x27;t recommend using daily for tanning because I was looking a bit orange. After vacation I was using it once or twice a week and I wasn&#x27;t orange at all.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the smell its very banana like. I don&#x27;t seem to really get a good dark color though but of course I don&#x27;t tan everyday. Its just kinda maintaining it. But all in all I think its a decent product.</li>
    <li> I prefer my tanning lotions to be more oily.</li>
    <li> Best indoor tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I first discovered Love Junkie by Designer skin 3 years ago, and I wont tan with anything else ! I have tried others in between here and there but always keep coming back to my Love Junkie! Its light, smells delicious before and after, goes on smooth and does not streak like some of the other lotions. Im very fair, but by about 3 to 4 times in the tanning bed I can really see some color! I give this product an A plus!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  I love the smell and the self tanner is great for my very white skin.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used Love Junkie for years. I moved a few years back and was no able to find any. I decided to look online, and was pleased to find it. I am definitely going back to Love Junkie. It gives the results that I seek. I do not want the overtanned, fake tanned look.. Love Junkie gives a beautiful natural tan, quick. And it helps with maintaining a long lasting tan, as long as you stay moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels and looks.  Looks like chocolate!  Yummmm  I get pretty good tans with this product.  The price is right!</li>
    <li> Same product you buy at the tanning salon but half the price. I love how this lotion smells too, it&#x27;s very fruity and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Best bronzer ever besides a tingle. Not greasy, no orange color, made my skin super soft, color lasted a while, and the smell is probably my favorite part. This is the lotion I always go back to.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and how tan you get in one session. It is perfect for the people that do not want to tan everyday but want that \\&quot;fresh tan\\&quot; glow.</li>
    <li> Best lotion hands down...use it everyday.  Purchased this years ago and today they still have the sme dark bronzing formula and its awesome</li>
    <li> Love this product. I ran a tanning salon for 7 years and of all the lotions I have tried (both high end and lower end) this is my absolute favorite and works amazingly. Love the designer skin line. Lots of good tanning and post tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> I tan very easily so the most important thing to me about a tanning lotion is the smell. I tan mostly on my lunch break at work and I dont want to smell like tanning bed after I tan ( you know that weird tanning bed smell on your skin) this is the only product I have ever used that I actually felt like I still smelt good after I got ouf of the tanning bed. I started using it the first time I ever went tanning 6 years ago and was hooked ever since. Other lotions smell good when you first put them on but not after you get out of the tanning. This lostion smells amazing before and after. (the only reason I ever tried other lotions is because this one became hard to find! so glad amazon has it)</li>
    <li> I use this lotion at the tanning salon.  It goes on nice and definitely helps keep my skin soft and stops the burning (along with sensibly regulating your time).  This is my 3rd bottle so it must work or I would not repurchase it.  The price was reasonable in comparison with the tanning salon (to be expected) and it has a very nice smell which makes it good for both men and women.  Not too perfumey and helps my extend my tan.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to try and decide on a tanning lotion just by reading reviews if you have never tried the product before. Before ordering this one, I had ordered another one with over a 4.5 star rating and was disappointed with it. I decided to try again and was so glad that I made the decision to go with this one. It smells so good and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even been this tan in my life! I am fair skinned but wanted to be very dark for vacation. I tanned for about 3 weeks with the other lotion and noticed some results but wasn&#x27;t very happy with them. After using this lotion for about a week, everyone who knows me couldn&#x27;t believe how tan I was! Even the ladies at the tanning salon asked me what I was using! I am what I call a messy-lotion-putter-on-er and that is NO problem with this lotion... it does not leave streaks or stain your hands. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan easy. But this stuff works pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t streak and the color is pretty consistent I have a pretty good starter tan, but I am going to have to use something a little stronger pretty soon.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing! I&#x27;m normally glow in the dark white super pale, but with this I have a decent tan going on. People actually have noticed the tan. Skin feels soft and not slimy after. Doesn&#x27;t leave you looking orange. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a fairly good product! Nothing extravagent but it gets the job done for the most part! So I am pleased :)</li>
