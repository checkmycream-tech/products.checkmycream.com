<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;d expect this would work best for shoulder length or longer hair.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be very good quality.  </li>
      <li>package noted that that this styler was ideal for medium-long hair, which is how my daughter is wearing her hair now.</li>

      <li>This brush is great; I love it.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, fried and fly away.  </li>
      <li>Style my hair nicely, gives it volume.</li>
      <li>The bamboo handle is nice, but the rest is just plastic.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, my daughter was thrilled with it and grabbed it up when I offered.</li>
      <li>They have so many great brushes for longer hair that smooth and don&#x27;t get tangled</li>

      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I had a \\&quot;Huh??\\</li>
      <li>Love it, works well.</li>
      <li>I love the size of this brush.</li>
      <li>I was expecting something more substantial, and more natural-feeling.</li>
      <li>The hollowed out brush would speed up drying in most locales</li>
      <li>Over all I&#x27;m satisfied and are looking forward to more products from Ecotools being released.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m just satisfied that the brush goes through my hair so painlessly.</li>
      <li>My hair is left looking and feeling great!</li>
      <li>brush creates a LOT of static in your hair.</li>
      <li>Using it from the top can cause frizz/static at the bottoms.</li>
      <li>I loved the smooth comfortable handle on this brush, it fit my hand</li>
      <li>It is probably a better fit for someone with longer hair, but despite the size issue the brush works well for me.</li>
      <li>While brushing the bristles don&#x27;t catch but go from top to bottom quite smoothly.</li>
      <li>I really love this brush, it&#x27;s light and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Although it lacked FULL VOLUME as described, it did give some volume, but most of all it made my hair look sleek.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>The bristles were fine</li>
      <li>It grips and holds the hair easily and provides a smooth blowdry.</li>
      <li>and it worked fine for him.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, it is huge.</li>
      <li>No annoying fly-aways.</li>
      <li>The bristles are comfortable on the scalp</li>
      <li>This brush is light weight which I like.  </li>
      <li>hair brush, since it grabs and combs through each strand, holding it securely while you use your hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>The barrel is also too large for my hair, but would be perfect for someone with really long hair.  </li>
      <li>So, that said, I was excited to see this brush.</li>
      <li>The venting in this brush helps it dry faster, and the size is great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real plus that this brush is eco-friendly using bamboo and cruelty free synthetic bristles!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, I have yet to notice any volumizing effect yet, but I suppose it is early days.</li>
      <li>First of all, the brush is very large and round, making it best for longer hair.  </li>
      <li>Using this brush, with the hairdryer on high speed and some volumizing mousse or root lifter, does seem to add more volume to my hair than a non-vented brush.</li>
      <li>I really liked the heft and feel of my previous brush better.  </li>
      <li>I do notice more static with this brush than my others, but I run a dab of smoothing product through my dry hair after drying, and that takes care of it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the bristles are all plastic and they &amp;#34;ate&amp;#34; my fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold since it&#x27;s very lightweight and the bristles seem sturdy.</li>
      <li>The barrel is nice and wide, perfect for my thick, wavy hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is right at shoulder length.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is a pretty nice brush.</li>
      <li>I have purchased a variety of makeup brushes by Ecotools, and I love them, so I was very excited to see what their round hairbrush would be like.</li>
      <li>I like this brush very much.  </li>
      <li>I liked that the middle of the actual brush was open so that heat could flow through the brush and to more of my hair easily.</li>
      <li>First of all, this brush is made well.  </li>
      <li>I like this model so much that I am eager to check out the ECOTOOLS Smoothing Detangler for my hair as well!</li>
      <li>They do the job ok, but after the baby-softness and natural feel of their also-synthetic makeup brush fibers, I just expected more.</li>
      <li>I really like this brush, but the description makes me laugh.  </li>
      <li>I have also noticed less static!</li>
      <li>First impressions were that this brush felt very &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this brush is nice it is also just average.</li>
      <li>I was surprised when I received the ECOTOOLS full volume styler.</li>
      <li>On dry hair, that it tangles easily and doesn&#x27;t feel as comfortable, I&#x27;ll continue to use my old brush.</li>
      <li>you can use a large barrel to add volume by using the barrel brush from underneath your hair</li>
      <li>so I need a large barrel to straighten.</li>
      <li>It has a large barrel and works well with my medium length hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly large with quality bristles.</li>
      <li>This brush is a great size for that and the same size as my previous brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large, the handle is comfortable, the bristles I think give my hair some extra shine (although that could just be my imagination), and the large barrel adds volume (all large barrels do).</li>
      <li>My hair is straight, shoulder length and colored.</li>
      <li>This is a very well made brush, sturdy.</li>
      <li>Silky straight.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;---It is very lightweight yet sturdy, and of course it&#x27;s also eco-friendly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you hair is already straight</li>
      <li>brush itself is very cheap-looking.  </li>
      <li>I regularly use conditioning products to smooth and silken my hair as well as comb through my hair in the shower, so there was no reason that the brush should have gotten stuck like that.</li>
      <li>This brush is bigger than I expected (which is good) and otherwise just what you&#x27;d expect from the picture.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine and flat (and thankfully shiny).  </li>
      <li>Time will tell if these brush bristles will stand the high heat necessary to blow curly hair smooth.</li>
      <li>Easy blow dry to bouncier, volumized hair</li>
      <li>so I attempted to use the brush when my hair was very wet (which I dislike doing because putting heat on soaking wet hair can&#x27;t be good for it) and when my hair was almost dry (again, I dislike doing this because then I lose any volume/style I might be able to create), and there were no changes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what makes this brush &amp;#34;eco-friendly&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a nice brush.  </li>
      <li>I have a large round boarshead bristle brush that I&#x27;ve used for years and love.  </li>
      <li>I have shoulder length hair which is very fine and gets very, very tangled after I wash it in our hard well-water.</li>
      <li>Although it is supposed to have &amp;#34;cruelty-free bristles,&amp;#34; it really pulls my hair - much more than my round metal barrel brushes with shorter bristles.  </li>
      <li>This is a very large brush, and I hoped to use it to create some volume in my otherwise fine, limp hair.  </li>
      <li>It is a wider brush, so if you are looking for a small brush to blow dry with, this isn&#x27;t it, but it works great for me.</li>
      <li>I get the idea of not wanting a brush that is too heavy, but this brush feels very cheap and flimsy.</li>
      <li>This brush really does cut down in drying time, is lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>gosh I miss what that little bit of ceramic accomplishes in keeping static at bay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really think this brush could be greatly improved if the smaller, oil-distributing bristles we&#x27;re switched out for real boar&#x27;s hair, and with the addition of ceramic strips at the base of the rows of bristles to prevent static.</li>
      <li>However, this might be the case with most round brushes.</li>
      <li>and they still look brand new.</li>
      <li>But the brush gets tangled very, very easily and it&#x27;s hard to get it untangled without damaging your hair.  </li>
      <li>This brush has tremendously reduced the time it takes to dry</li>
      <li>I first tried it when my hair was dry and already blown out straight.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy blow dry to bouncier, volumized hair</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and it dries much faster when I use this brush.  I bought an extra ones for travel and for friends!  Love this brush.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush, it&#x27;s light and easy to use. Style my hair nicely, gives it volume. My hair does not feel like its coming out when I style with this brush. No ouches.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why this brush is getting positive reviews, as it is by far the worst hairbrush I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is huge. That&#x27;s not necessarily a negative, just something to be aware of as it&#x27;s hard to judge size online.  I can only wrap my fingers three quarters of the way around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is very cheap-looking.  The bamboo handle is nice, but the rest is just plastic.  Again, not necessarily a negative, as long as it performs well.  Which brings me to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot get this through my hair.  I first tried it when my hair was dry and already blown out straight.  Silky straight.  No tangles.  I got it halfway down the length and to my surprise it got stuck. I&#x27;m sure I had a \\&quot;Huh??\\&quot; look on my face.  I took out some of my other hairbrushes and they glided through without problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the brush just now while blow drying my wet, combed hair.  Oh my gosh, it was painful.  The brush gripped so tightly I felt like it was ripping my hair out.  I could not move it completely from root to tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad, bad brush.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair which is very fine and gets very, very tangled after I wash it in our hard well-water. Combing/brushing out my hair is generally a miserable experience. I thought this brush went through my hair much easier than my usual  brushes. I used a blow dryer and it was true that my hair dried faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, I have yet to notice any volumizing effect yet, but I suppose it is early days. However, I&#x27;m just satisfied that the brush goes through my hair so painlessly.</li>
    <li> I love this brush...but I cannot use it while blow drying my hair because the way I blow dry,,,the bristles keep getting stuck in the hairdryer!! I know, I know I should not dry that close to my hair..but its what I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, its great especially for my thin hair, no tangles!!</li>
    <li> This is a large, nicely made brush, and a cruelty free product....but cruel to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep trying to use it and have finally given up.  It pulls my hair and has gotten tangled twice while trying to use it with the blow dryer.  I do use other products from this brand of Ecotools but this is a reject for me and my longer hair.  They have so many great brushes for longer hair that smooth and don&#x27;t get tangled but this is not one of them!</li>
    <li> I love the size of this brush. The barrel is nice and wide, perfect for my thick, wavy hair. It still takes forever to blow dry it thoroughly but this brush certainly helps. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold since it&#x27;s very lightweight and the bristles seem sturdy. All in all a great brush at a nice price.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are terrible on my fine hair!  They really pulled hard when just using to brush hair and were unbearable when trying to use as a styling tool.</li>
    <li> This brush is bigger than I expected (which is good) and otherwise just what you&#x27;d expect from the picture.  The vegan imitation boar bristles would have fooled me and the larger ball tipped bristles are comfortable on the scalp.  Seems to be very good quality.  I&#x27;d expect this would work best for shoulder length or longer hair.  The hollowed out brush would speed up drying in most locales but I live in a very dry climate so I did not notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this brush. I have thin, shoulder length hair but a lot of it. Since I have a lot of layers, I was excited to use a brush that would help cut down on drying time. First impressions were that this brush felt very &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;. I get the idea of not wanting a brush that is too heavy, but this brush feels very cheap and flimsy. I also did not like the quality of the synthetic bristles. They were very hard and even the ones that were supposed to be softer, were still hard and &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34;. I liked that the middle of the actual brush was open so that heat could flow through the brush and to more of my hair easily. When I attempted to dry my hair with a blow dryer and this brush, I noticed right away that my towel-dried hair was getting stuck in the brush. It yanked and pulled, with such little effort, that I had to continually stop drying and use both hands to get the brush out. I regularly use conditioning products to smooth and silken my hair as well as comb through my hair in the shower, so there was no reason that the brush should have gotten stuck like that. I thought that maybe it was because my hair was partly air/towel dried so I attempted to use the brush when my hair was very wet (which I dislike doing because putting heat on soaking wet hair can&#x27;t be good for it) and when my hair was almost dry (again, I dislike doing this because then I lose any volume/style I might be able to create), and there were no changes. This brush got stuck every time. I can not speak to how well this brush speeds up drying time or how much volume it adds since I could not use it without stopping to untangle my hair constantly. I do not recommend this brush for any reason, especially not for the purposes listed.</li>
    <li> Love it, works well. Didn&#x27;t give it a five because of the size of the brush. When I ordered it, I thought it would be average size, but it&#x27;s jumbo sized.  It is probably a better fit for someone with longer hair, but despite the size issue the brush works well for me.</li>
    <li> The brush can&#x27;t be used in wet hair, which was the whole point of it. It grabs and pulls wet hair and makes a tangled mess, instead of running smoothly through the hair so that you can turn the round barrel while you dry your hair. It&#x27;s utterly useless.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made brush, sturdy. I have used it for several weeks and there is no bristle loosening or handle wobbling. I am very pleased with it. It is a wider brush, so if you are looking for a small brush to blow dry with, this isn&#x27;t it, but it works great for me.</li>
    <li> I found this brush dried my hair a little faster due to the open spaces in the brush and it gave me volume at the roots.  However, I did not like the brush handle itself.  I found it to be bulky and it was hard to use when I straightened my hair in the back and on the sides.  The bristles were fine but I just use this for my root section and I found myself switching to my old brush to style the rest of my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered the item by mistake. The web page doesn&#x27;t show cylinder shape and I thought it is flat rectangular shape. Although it is wrong shape for my short hair, it does really good job for styling. It grab my hair very well instead of slipping. I am keeping it. See my  close up shots.  Update: I bought an another brush without ball tips, &amp;#34;Sleek and Shine Finisher&amp;#34;. What a difference, without ball tips, machine cut bristles hit and irritate my scalp. So I stick with comforting brush with ball tips.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush, but the description makes me laugh.  First of all, the brush is very large and round, making it best for longer hair.  (Mine is shoulder length.)  It has a completely open cage body, that lets air flow through.  The biggest difference, in my opinion, is those synthetic boar hair bristles.  Each cluster of bristles has one typical  longer shaft, with a small round tip, to prevent it from scratching your scalp, like most plastic brushes.  But then it is surrounded by shorter uncapped plastic bristles, that grip the hair.  These bristles make the entire brush perform more like conventional [boar&#x27;s hair?] hair brush, since it grabs and combs through each strand, holding it securely while you use your hair dryer.  My old round plastic open-body hair brush slips through my hair and tends to not hold it well when I am trying to dry it.  It works extremely well with my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is right at shoulder length.  This is a very large brush, and I hoped to use it to create some volume in my otherwise fine, limp hair.  But the brush gets tangled very, very easily and it&#x27;s hard to get it untangled without damaging your hair.  I won&#x27;t be using this.</li>
    <li> I have a large round boarshead bristle brush that I&#x27;ve used for years and love.  Purchased in a beauty supply store, for about the same price as this brush, it&#x27;s been a workhorse for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was encouraged to try this brush by the promise of faster drying times. While this did indeed allow my hair to dry faster due to the vents, I also found that it tangled much easier than my old brush.  I have a shoulder length Sassoon type bob and need the brush to tame my frizzy hair into straight curves. This brush is a great size for that and the same size as my previous brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to note: this is lightweight and does have a bit of a plastic feeling.  For a $11 or so brush, that was surprising to me. I really liked the heft and feel of my previous brush better.  But the drying time is such a factor that I will definitely continue to use this brush on wet hair.  On dry hair, that it tangles easily and doesn&#x27;t feel as comfortable, I&#x27;ll continue to use my old brush.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a pretty nice brush. I like the fact that it is synthetic instead of actual boar, and it feels very sturdy. I also like that Ecotools makes this brush, as I have some of their makeup brushes and I have found that they are well-made and hold up over time. However, it&#x27;s not perfect. I don&#x27;t have an issue with the size (which is detailed in the description of the product), but I do find that I have to be very careful when using this brush, as it is liable to get tangled and stuck in my hair! However, this might be the case with most round brushes. I think the price is a bit high, but certainly not exorbitant given the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> First of all, this brush is made well.  It&#x27;s sturdy and feels made to last even though it&#x27;s lightweight plastic.  The bristles are comfortable on the scalp and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with tangling on my 6&amp;#34; layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this brush just wears me out.  It doesn&#x27;t glide through the hair as well as I&#x27;d like and while the handle is comfortable to hold, it is hard to grip while rolling the brush.  It&#x27;s easier to just section the hair and wrap around the brush and hold in place until dry which doesn&#x27;t give the same results as rolling while drying.</li>
    <li> Time will tell if these brush bristles will stand the high heat necessary to blow curly hair smooth. I like how it handles my long thick hair so far.</li>
    <li> This style of this brush allows air to pass through. This is the brush I use when I&#x27;m straightening my hair and I use it in conjunction with my hairdryer (which has a diffuser on the end). This brush is great; I love it. It&#x27;s large, the handle is comfortable, the bristles I think give my hair some extra shine (although that could just be my imagination), and the large barrel adds volume (all large barrels do). I have thick, naturally curly, long hair...so I need a large barrel to straighten. If you hair is already straight you can use a large barrel to add volume by using the barrel brush from underneath your hair (roots to the end, pushing the brush out -- in a curved motion almost). Using it from the top can cause frizz/static at the bottoms.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to say but this brush is just different from any other I&#x27;ve had. I do like it.</li>
    <li> This is a well made hairbrush. It&#x27;s fairly large with quality bristles. The brush definitely dried my hair much faster, but the volume was just so-so. My hair is straight, shoulder length and colored. Although it lacked FULL VOLUME as described, it did give some volume, but most of all it made my hair look sleek. No annoying fly-aways. Recommended.</li>
    <li> The bristles are rubbery and bend against the head which tangled my hair. I had to use a detangling comb to separate pieces of hair to dry as the brush would not go through my medium thick hair. Purchased it on a whim and sorry I did. Really difficult to use and bad for wet hair as it requires so much pulling to get it into position.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I received the ECOTOOLS full volume styler. I&#x27;ve had a styling brush for years, and was expecting something similar, but this was different in a couple of ways. First of all, it was bigger than the one I have - much bigger. Since I have very short hair, it wouldn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, my daughter was thrilled with it and grabbed it up when I offered. She loved the bigger size because she said it gave her the volume she wanted, dried her hair faster, and didn&#x27;t get tangled up in her hair like smaller styling brushes had in the past.  She even showed me how it worked for her longer, thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package noted that that this styler was ideal for medium-long hair, which is how my daughter is wearing her hair now. A plus with this product is that it is eco-friendly. So, my daughter gave it an A+.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, fried and fly away.  This brush really does cut down in drying time, is lightweight and easy to use.  I wished I had realized it was hair longer than mine(not quite shoulder length).  Since it decreased my drying time that earns it four stars.  Had it had a smaller barrel it would have earned five stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what makes this brush &amp;#34;eco-friendly&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a nice brush.  Sturdy with longer plastic bristles and shorter nylon (or natural?  not sure) bristles.  Works fine.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine and flat (and thankfully shiny).  I wash it every morning.  The venting in this brush helps it dry faster, and the size is great.  My hair is about halfway between my chin and my shoulders, so for chin length or shorter, I would use a smaller brush.  Using this brush, with the hairdryer on high speed and some volumizing mousse or root lifter, does seem to add more volume to my hair than a non-vented brush.</li>
    <li> I loved the smooth comfortable handle on this brush, it fit my hand just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the bristles are all plastic and they &amp;#34;ate&amp;#34; my fine straight hair. Other than that it is a well made product. If you are wanting a brush with no animal hair, this might be a good choice for you. My DH has thicker hair with some wave and it worked fine for him.</li>
    <li> This left my hair impossibly staticky.  Not sure why as I don&#x27;t have that problem with other brushes.  The barrel is also too large for my hair, but would be perfect for someone with really long hair.  It feels like plastic and wasn&#x27;t very comfortable when I used it.</li>
    <li> For the record, I have long, straight, medium-weight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---This brush is hollow, and it does reduce drying time if you use it while blow-drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;---The hollow allows heat to pass through to the other side, so it also increases the effectiveness for styling with the blow dryer, like curling the ends over or under.&lt;br /&gt;---It is very lightweight yet sturdy, and of course it&#x27;s also eco-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;---They claim that the shorter \\&quot;synthetic boars hair bristles\\&quot; distribute oils down the shafts of your hair towards the tips, and the brush does accomplish this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---I really hate the fake boar&#x27;s hair bristles! They smell like plastic and feel like plastic. They do the job ok, but after the baby-softness and natural feel of their also-synthetic makeup brush fibers, I just expected more. These work, but they still feel like fake, scratchy plastic.&lt;br /&gt;---This brush creates a LOT of static in your hair. My regular brush is by Conair, and I had taken for granted the small ceramic ring around the bed of the brush. But when you try a brush without it (this Ecotools round brush), you notice! Maybe they wanted to keep the weight down, but gosh I miss what that little bit of ceramic accomplishes in keeping static at bay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this on Vine, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I have purchased a variety of makeup brushes by Ecotools, and I love them, so I was very excited to see what their round hairbrush would be like. I&#x27;ll admit, when I first opened the package, I couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed. I was expecting something more substantial, and more natural-feeling. In spite of this initial dismay, the brush has grown on me. I really think this brush could be greatly improved if the smaller, oil-distributing bristles we&#x27;re switched out for real boar&#x27;s hair, and with the addition of ceramic strips at the base of the rows of bristles to prevent static. I like this brush,but I&#x27;ll use it ONLY for blow-drying.</li>
    <li> Faux boar bristles and a vented core recommend this brush. I used this and it dried my hair faster at the roots and gave me more volume than my current styling brush. However, I did use my usual volumizer because my hair is fine.&lt;br /&gt;While this brush is nice it is also just average. The charm is in the design.</li>
    <li> This brush is light weight which I like.  Although it is supposed to have &amp;#34;cruelty-free bristles,&amp;#34; it really pulls my hair - much more than my round metal barrel brushes with shorter bristles.  I find that I am unable to effectively use this brush to dry and style my hair as it simply feels like I&#x27;m pulling my hair out at the roots.  I&#x27;ve resorted to simply using this brush as I would a flat brush - to simply brush my hair straight out without wrapping it around the barrel to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the barrel is 1 7/8 inch.</li>
    <li> The Ecotools Full Volume Styler Hairbrush works wonderfully on my thick hair. My hair is  longer than shoulder length and it usually takes quite some time with the blow dryer before it&#x27;s dry enough to my liking. This brush has tremendously reduced the time it takes to dry and it has prevented unwanted heat damage! I have also noticed less static! The brush is very nice when it comes to styling my hair and it gives body and volume quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is light weight to hold and it&#x27;s no bigger than most other hairbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. While brushing the bristles don&#x27;t catch but go from top to bottom quite smoothly. My hair is left looking and feeling great! It&#x27;s a real plus that this brush is eco-friendly using bamboo and cruelty free synthetic bristles! I like this model so much that I am eager to check out the ECOTOOLS Smoothing Detangler for my hair as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I like the Ecotools brand. I use their makeup brushes and have had them around 6 years and they still look brand new. So, that said, I was excited to see this brush. I had purchased a paddle brush with bamboo handle by a different company awhile ago and it was a lot more expensive. I needed to replace my old round brush, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. This brush also has the bamboo handle, with recycled plastic body. The barrel is large, but I like that in a round brush (I have chin length hair), I use a wide barrel to build volume. I didn&#x27;t notice any snagging or tangling with this brush, but I have been styling with a round brush everyday for around 15 years and have short hair. I didn&#x27;t notice it necessarily drying my hair faster than my old round brush, but the old one was vented too. The fact that the body of the brush is plastic and not metal, I&#x27;m hoping will  be less heat damaging. Over all I&#x27;m satisfied and are looking forward to more products from Ecotools being released.</li>
    <li> I blowdry my hair straight at least once a week and this has become my chosen brush for the job. It grips and holds the hair easily and provides a smooth blowdry. It has a large barrel and works well with my medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Sorry but i did not have any luck with this brush.  I blew out my hair twice and both times my hair came out dull and flat.  It did dry it quicker though</li>
    <li> I like this brush very much.  It does seem to help my hair dry much faster than a traditional round brush.  I do notice more static with this brush than my others, but I run a dab of smoothing product through my dry hair after drying, and that takes care of it.</li>
