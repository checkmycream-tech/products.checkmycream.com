<li> It&#x27;s a long piece of malleable wire.  </li>
<li> What I received has large flowers on one side and small on the other.  </li>
<li> ANd it&#x27;s not really a head band.  </li>
<li> What I received doesn&#x27;t even look remotely like this!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s also on this really thin, bendable wire which only lands about an inch above reach ear.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t stick up to high on your head like the others and make you look like you have an awkward crown.  </li>
<li> and we had a small wedding</li>
<li> That, in cocombination with the fact that it keeps slipping off to one side because of the heavy flowers, make it impossible to wear.</li>
<li> SERIOUSLY WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?</li>
<li> But it was a tough choice to make.  </li>
<li> The girl that said it was uncomfortable is totally wrong.  </li>

    <li> Pros: Beautiful. Arrived fast.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Bends SUPER EASY and feels a little flimsy on</li>

    <li> I just got married and needed something beautiful to wear as a crown. This headband is beautiful...even better than  the picture. in addition is comfortable. The best headband ever!</li>
    <li> Wore this on my wedding day. It was beautiful. Photographed great! I wanted something simple and semi organic looking for my wedding, that worked as a tiara. I&#x27;m a princess in my heart still, but I&#x27;m also a low key kind of girl and we had a small wedding so this was perfect. I received tons of compliments from many guests about it. Unlike my veil which I took out when we started to dance, my tiara/headband stayed on all night and fit great. I would completely recommend.</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Love how it adjusts and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wearing this to my wedding in October - very nice for the price.  Looks and feels great, and easily adjustable.</li>
    <li> This was a beautiful addition to my daughter&#x27;s prom day. It was gorgeous in person,held up well and fit her head nicely.</li>
    <li> This floral crown with rhinestones and beading literally made my prom night complete. It bends very easily, but everything was on there very securely and nothing fell off the entire night. The only con there is about it is that there is nothing to keep it on your head in place, but you can easily fix that with bobby pins or shoving it under some strands of hair. Overall, it easily completed my look for prom and tied everything together. This was also better than a typical crown because that is the look everyone goes for so this is something different.</li>
    <li> I cant wait to wear on my wedding day! The beads match perfectly to my dress!</li>
    <li> It was absolutely beautiful.  Even better than the picture!</li>
    <li> worked perfectly. Very pretty!!</li>
    <li> I just received mine, and it looks nothing like the picture.  It has these 2 huge, cheap looking flowers on one side and smaller on the other side.  It&#x27;s also on this really thin, bendable wire which only lands about an inch above reach ear.  That, in cocombination with the fact that it keeps slipping off to one side because of the heavy flowers, make it impossible to wear.</li>
    <li> I WORE IT ON MY WEDDING DAY AND IT LOOKED ELEGANTLY STUNNING. BUY NOW NOW NOW. SERIOUSLY WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?</li>
    <li> When I bought my wedding dress the salesperson showed me dozens of tiaras and headbands that started at over one hundred dollars.  This one was every bit as nice if not nicer than any of the ones they had. It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful.  Its just the right amount of bling to be beautiful without being overpowering, very classic. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice but it did photograph well in my pictures.  I am absolutely thrilled with this purchase. It arrived incredibly fast as well.</li>
    <li> It is much prettier in person then in this picture.  It really sparkles.  Doesn&#x27;t stick up to high on your head like the others and make you look like you have an awkward crown.  The girl that said it was uncomfortable is totally wrong.  It can&#x27;t really be uncomfortable because you can bend it to fit your head exactly!  At first it did hurt because it comes perfectly round but after spending about 30 seconds, it fit perfectly.  Can&#x27;t wait to wear July 4th for my wedding!</li>
    <li> I do like this piece, it&#x27;s dainty, it&#x27;s simple, it sparkles and very pretty.  I did not end up keeping this, not for any product issues or seller issues etc, I ended up finding another piece that I loved more.  But it was a tough choice to make.  If you are looking for something simple but yet very pretty, this is a great choice.  The sparkles are very pretty.</li>
    <li> Love it ! I am on a wedding budget and this is Exactly what I was looking for without the big price tag. Couldn&#x27;t believe how fast the shipping was, Sooooo glad I ordered !</li>
    <li> What I received doesn&#x27;t even look remotely like this!  ANd it&#x27;s not really a head band.  It&#x27;s a long piece of malleable wire.  What I received has large flowers on one side and small on the other.  It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s not what I ordered!</li>
    <li> Elegant addition to our wedding!</li>
    <li> very pretty was going to wear for my wedding, but it looked a little kitchy...</li>
    <li> The packaging was great! I cannot wait to wear it on my wedding day! It is absolutely beautiful and in perfect condition! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very pretty and the metal pieces can all be slightly bent to better fit the wearer.</li>
