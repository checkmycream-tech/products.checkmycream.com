<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very well, smells very similar to honest Amish beard balm.</li>
    <li> The way I use this and it results in an incredibly smooth baby soft face is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always use a shaving mirror in the shower to get your skin warm and soft first.&lt;br /&gt;I always use a new Gillette Fusion Power Proglide Flexball shaver and blade.&lt;br /&gt;Then I exfoliate my face first with St. Ives Blemish Control Face scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Then next I use the Jack Black Face Buff polish on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Then next I finish cleaning with the Dr. Bronners Shea Butter &amp; Dead Sea Salt Soap.&lt;br /&gt;Then I use this American Crew Shave Oil, rubbing it all over my face and neck very good.&lt;br /&gt;Then I put on the Art Of Shaving shaving cream, non fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Then lastly I put on the Cremo Cream shaving cream...then shave normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a lot of work but the whole process takes me five minutes....and my face is smoother then any others I&#x27;ve seen around....worth every penny for every step of the process...you can&#x27;t put a price on a nice clean, smooth, well groomed face.  My girlfriend and all of my female friends love it....women of taste and class do in face notice how well a man takes care of himself, so stay on point.</li>
    <li> Its okay, will not purchase again. I have purchased better shaving oils.</li>
    <li> Really nice shaving oil. Works well... and doesn&#x27;t cost too much.  I&#x27;ll be ordering again when I make it through this bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it in combination with American Crew Herbal Shave cream and it does an amazing job.  It allows the razor to glide effortlessly over my skin causing little to no irritation.  I can the difference when I do not use it.  No strong scent, oil washes off easily and does not clog the razor head.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to shaving oil. Very slick and thick enough. Remember to add a splash of water to it to get it to be very slippery. I love the smell, but it tastes horrible (if you accidentally get it in your mouth).</li>
    <li> The oils that are in here work marvelously. I used to have to wait for my skin to heal for a few days before shaving again. Now I can shave every other day if i&#x27;d like. If you put too much on then you will have hair stick in the blades, however it is such a small price to pay for healthy looking and feeling skin.</li>
    <li> I always get a close and comfortable shave with this oil.  Also a good oil to use as a base when shaving with soap.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Decent value. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I had some sample shave oil from Art of Shaving that was amazing, but I figured this would be as good and a little cheaper. Big fail. After a couple of irritating shaves, I stopped using it. That actually made my skin feel better.</li>
    <li> A great alternative to shaving cream - leaves all of the shaven areas fresh and smooth - dump the cream, embrace the oil</li>
    <li> It smells great and it works nicely.  Although, to be honest, I don&#x27;t really use this shave oil much any more.  I still have more than half the bottle after having bought it a couple years ago.  Any ol shaving cream works for me.  This is kinda more if you have the time to go all out with your shave.  I tend to shave at the last minute when I&#x27;m ready to head out the door.</li>
    <li> Have used other oiks.  This best and half the price.  I&#x27;ll stay with this shave oil!  #CloseShave</li>
    <li> Makes shaving less painful</li>
    <li> I suppose it shipped okay, but the bottle leaks, it smells bad, and there is no difference in razor friction upon use.</li>
    <li> I tried ordering this twice and both times I was sent some ultra gliding shave oil (or something like that).  Just beware that you likely won&#x27;t get \\&quot;lubricating shave oil\\&quot; if you order this.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s simply the wrong product, or if they&#x27;ve just updated the name on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Was using the Art of Shaving oil but decided to try this to see if I could save a little bit of money. This works comparably well enough. Doesn&#x27;t have as good a smell or give quite as smooth a shave. I will keep using the Art of Shaving balm but will use the American Crew shave oil to save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> Up until a month ago I was shaving electric, when I &amp;#34;wet shaved&amp;#34; I almost immediately felt razor burn (especially around the neck area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started reading about the use of DE razors, oils and a shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;After a month I can say the razor burn is gone and the shave is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil puts a barrier between the razor and your skin, when applying (only 2 drops) you immediately feel your skin becoming supple. The scent is minty and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gear:&lt;br /&gt;American Crew pre oil&lt;br /&gt;Edwin Jagger Chrome Lined DE Razor (DE89Lbl) + Derby razors&lt;br /&gt;Fantasia Badger brush&lt;br /&gt;Taylors of Old Bond Street cream&lt;br /&gt;Niveay after shave (anti irritation) balm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &#x27;downside&#x27; to the oil is it&#x27;s not cheap. (but then again you only use 2 drops)</li>
    <li> A great shaving solution. Shaving cream is no longer necessary.</li>
    <li> this is very good lightly menthol with a mild fragrance very slippery without being a big mess I used 4 drops and it ended up being more than I needed to use great product</li>
    <li> I was using Shave Secret, I purchased from Walgreens after hearing about it from a co-worker, I was really impressed with it, so I thought, surely if I spend a little more cash on a well known men&#x27;s products name brand it will be even better yet.  I was wrong, Shave Secret blows it away.  This product gives a warming sensation when applied to the face for about 2 seconds and doesn&#x27;t lubricate any where near Shave Secret.  Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned bread, get Shave Secret. Crew shave oil sucks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to get King of Shaves Kinexis Oil at a fair price on the Internet. You can get that at Harmon Drugs in the NY area at a decent price.</li>
    <li> He picked this stuff up in a salon in LA in 2008 and I&#x27;ve had to buy it online ever since. It&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t give him razor burn or irritate his skin. He LOVES it. My only complaint is I wish the containers were bigger!! Oh and the smell is fabulous. I seriously love this on my husband. Nothing like a clean shave AND a nice masculine scent!</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of pre shave oil that I use.  The tingly feeling from the menthol is a nice feeling and it helps my razor glide effortlessly over my skin while I&#x27;m shaving.  That has helped me clear up my skin which is really sensitive.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it under shaving soap, as a base lubricant.  I can see using by itself, though.  What the product description doesn&#x27;t tell you is that if you put it on your hands and rub them together it will warm up nicely.  You can then apply it to your face.  Fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> been ordering this for years now. i know there is clove oil in there. i want to make this at home.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product and for me represents a pinnacle of shaving evolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone from using pathetic gillette type foams, through to the much better King of Shaves balm and finally to this American Crew product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm really does cut down on irritation and you only need about 4 drops per shave. The shave is much smoother than with all the aforementioned products. I shave every working day, so you get an impression of shaving frequency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final thing with this is the price. Just the other day, I was going through my orders and it amounts to 2/year! So for less money, you get a better product!</li>
    <li> I have new view of shaving. A close, comfortable shave (but I also use a foam gel)</li>
    <li> not sure if it really helps, actually inhibits shave cream lather on face.  Also tends to lather as it is applied as directed on stubble.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite smelling shave oil.  Love the menthol smell and works as you would expect, helps reduce irritation and makes shaving easier.  I use with an additional shaving cream or without, works well either way.</li>
    <li> Smells great and allows for a close shave without irritation using my electric razor. I typically dry-shave, which tends to be faster than when using this product. You have to move fast or risk it getting thick as it dries. If that happens, just add some water and it will get slick again.</li>
    <li> Product meets its claims.  Need a little more than reported for comfortable shave.  Pulls a little along the chin.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil at a reasonable price. If you haven&#x27;t shaved with oil before, do it, you can thank me later! I thought to myself 1.7 ounces wouldn&#x27;t be enough, but it has lasted me a long time so for. Albeit that I only shave about every 3-4 days due to laziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this enough if you use old fashioned Safety Razors, using this oil makes the experience so much better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is affordable and warms going on. I won&#x27;t shave without it. If you are using a safety or straight razor, this will drastically improve the longevity of your blade and time between honing. Highly recommend it. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have yet to experience a 5 star preshave oil. I imagine it would be magical.</li>
    <li> The point of a shave oil is to add comfort the the shaving process.  As per the directions on the bottle I used if after putting warm water on my face and before putting a shave cream on.  It does considerably help the razor glide over your skin but the quality of the shave is not any better or worse than without the use of the oil.  It just is a bit more comfortable in terms of the razor feel but is uncomfortable and slightly stings your pores after it has been on your skin for about 90 seconds.  This stuff wakes you up in the morning better than coffee so if you are the type that relaxes on the weekends don&#x27;t use it then.  If you have a favorite after shave or cologne you use daily it will alter the effect because this oil has a strong clove scent to it.  I do not use a scented after shave so it has not been a problem for me.  The clove scent sort of vanishes about an hour after the shave.  I would not buy this product again because the same result can be achieved with any generic odorless mineral oil you can buy for a few dollar per huge bottle instead of a few ounces of this stuff for about $14.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for a shave oil that improves the quality of the shave while adding the comfort.</li>
    <li> this is sold as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; which has to be packed with other orders, but the packaging is not airtight which meant that the bottle leaked inside the box with the rest of my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was a very pleasanly scented disc drive box, and about half the contents of the bottle lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Mixed with your shave cream or soap will make shaving sensitive skin so much easier.  Reduces nicks IMHO.</li>
    <li> I ordered the American Crew Lubricating Shave Oil.  But instead I received American Crew Ultra Gliding Shave Oil.  If this is the new formula then it is a huge mistake.  The Ultra Gliding formula oil is much lighter and doesn&#x27;t coat your face like the Lubricating formula.  The Ultra Gliding Shave Oil actually foamed up a little while rubbing on my face.  This new formula is HORRIBLE!!!!</li>
    <li> Crew makes an awesome product I use this with a pre shave lotion and my straight razor just glides, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use under my Proraso paste. It seems to scrub away with the badger brush application. I have perceived no benefit from using this product. The smell is meh. I have used it to touch up my sideburns and even after waiting 5 minutes after application I shred my face and flinch as I make the first draw.</li>
    <li> Love the product makes shaving much more easy and comfortable, it does not leave any smell. I highly recommended :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I will change is the product cap they should make the cap so you can get drops to make it a little less messy other than that great :)</li>
    <li> used as a beard softener. Made my beard smell good and feel softer with 3 to 4 drops.</li>
    <li> I use this when I shave. I mix some in with shaving cream to produce a fine slick mixture that helps reduce razor drag and nicks. You only need 2-3 drops at a time. A bottle lasts me over a year. Try it and you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> Used David Somersets shaving oil previously, this one is even better at a better price!&lt;br /&gt;Great shave for a sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works ok, but my skin on my neck got very irritated. Used shaving cream, problem disappeared.</li>
    <li> If all shave oils are like this one, then I have closed with them.&lt;br /&gt;Found it very irritating for my skin and after reading about some of the ingredients it contains - this is not surprising at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product was a bad shaving experience for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this pre lubricating oil.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really cut down on the irritation and redness on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I only use a couple drops, rub it around in my hands, and into my face.&lt;br /&gt;Does exactly what I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a lubricant under my shave cream and reapply when I shave against the grain. I use a safety razor and this really allows the razor to glide across my skin and cut only the hair. The safety razor give a far superior shave to any cartridge, but would be an excellent addition to any shave procedure. This works very well as and electric shave lubricant as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Double Edged Blade Shaver and this clever product makes the experience, and the result, even better. Simply put, this is a lubricant that one applies before shaving, even before applying the shaving foam, that eases the razor down the face. Since I&#x27;ve been using it I&#x27;ve had far fewer nicks and much smoother shaves. It takes very little, no more than a pea sized drop to work into your hands and cover your whole face. Of course, I take it further: I also shave my head so it&#x27;s used there to get a smoother, easier shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t understand is why I&#x27;d never heard of this until a month or so ago. The enthusiasm of the person suggesting it goaded me to make the purchase and I&#x27;m very glad I did. For the modest price, this is one of those products that more than delivers value for money. It&#x27;s worth the investment just to discover how well it works. And, I don&#x27;t know this, but I should think that for ladies shaving their legs, there&#x27;s an application although, based on all the lotions and potions sold for women perhaps it already exists. What I&#x27;d bet is that the ladies&#x27; version comes in an elaborate bottle and box and costs many times more than their masculine equivalent as offered here.</li>
    <li> If you have never used shave oil you are missing out.  This bottle has provided quite a few months worth of shaves and still has quite a bit left.  I can tell a different when not using this as my facial hair seems to grow back quicker.  I used 5 drops of this then some shaving cream on top and get the best shave.  Some people say you can make you own but this is a great scent in a reasonable sized bottle which I can take with me anywhere.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Art of Shaving from Birchbox and really enjoyed it. Unfortunatly, Art of Shaving is very expensive. The Crew brand works just as good at half the price - I cannot notice any difference in the two brands.</li>
    <li> A little too much menthol or peppermint type of oil, but much better than foam shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I started out using Shave Secret oil which is also a great product and a bit cheaper but in a smaller bottle. I tried this and I have to say that to me it is the top of the line in shave oils. It is richer and my blade just glides over my head and face so easy that it just takes me 5 minutes to shave head and face in shower. The smell is not as strong as shave secret either which I like. If you are using shave oils this one definantely  deserves a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of American Crew products and this stuff hasn&#x27;t disappointed yet. I use about 8 or so drops shaving 2-3 times a bottle lasted for almost a year. Wouldn&#x27;t want to shave without a shave oil and this stuff comes at a decent enough price.</li>
    <li> This came in the mail a few weeks ago. The oil was leaking and 2 or 3 long black hairs were stuck to the outside. Nasty. It really doesn&#x27;t smell too good either... however I felt I still needed to at least try it once. It was effective. This is the first time American Crew has let me down.</li>
    <li> I got a bottle as a present from my wife. Provides what I need for a better smoother shave, and the scent is ok.</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve purchased American Crew Shave Oil. This is the manliest shave oil you can buy. Buy American Crew!</li>
    <li> Its ok. It smells good and feels good. Better than any cream. Close shave. It loses its  slickness as soon as it gets wet. Shave secret is better. Water actually makes it easier.  You do have to rinse the razor often.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, that&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars. Other than the smell, I hate this oil. It gums up my razor and won&#x27;t come out unless I wash it in soapy water. Not a good way to shave every day.</li>
    <li> An aesthetician told me that men who get a lot of ingrown hairs from shaving can really benefit from massaging in a few drops of shave oil before the shaving cream. It certainly worked for me. I started out with a super-premium brand, [[ASIN:B000FHGF3O Elemis Smooth Result Shave Oil 1.2 fl oz.]] but didn&#x27;t want to keep paying the high price. So I tried [[ASIN:B0023XF60Q SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL- THE BEST SHAVE EVER! 18.75ML]] which gives you a lot for the money but doesn&#x27;t stick to the face very well and leaves you smelling like a eucalyptus tree. So I settled on this one: an effective shave oil with an inoffensive smell at a good price. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Many people swear by shaving oil.  I have used different ones in the past, and this one is exactly like all of them: Oil which will provide additional lubrication to your regular shaving cream/soap.  I just bought it to compare to other oils.  The smell is nice, and it&#x27;s oily like it should be.  Probably a bit overpriced if I&#x27;m being honest.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and is useful especially for folks who frequently get cuts or who don&#x27;t feel good after shaving. I simply love this product. The only limitation is that this is not easily available in stores where they sell American Crew products.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil, smells nice, and makes your shaving more comfortable for sure. You may not even need shaving cream if you use this, but that depends on the person. I still apply shaving cream.</li>
    <li> All shave oils are not created equal.  This is clearly the best one.  Nothing is slicker.</li>
    <li> Nice warming feel when applied. A few drops provide great protection, glide and added moisture. For the cost, I prefer this over the Art of Shaving pre-shave oil. It&#x27;s about 1/2 the cost and provides equal protection.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Keeps razor burn to a minimum.  Using this with a safety razor has completely changed my shaving experience. Much better than cartridges.  My only complaint is that it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaving Oil. Not greasy and smell is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you make your skin wet with water first and then apply this oil.&lt;br /&gt;and then apply foam. You will get very good smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried another brand from my local store once but turns out not to be an actual oil.&lt;br /&gt;Its real oil but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the Quantity. It lasts less than a month.</li>
    <li> I could not shave in the shower without the oil, and this stuff is good. I also got a great price on Amazon! Be careful with this bottle, though. You only need a few drops.</li>
    <li> With the oil, you can see where you have hair left; no need to moisturize after shaving.  Saves so much time, and gets a better, closer shave!</li>
    <li> I have a very difficult beard. I am fair-skinned and my beard is dark brown--almost black--and coarse. To get anything approximating a close shave, I have to shave \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; of my beard, but with regular shaving cream, this results in a horrifying bloody mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many years I used an electric razor to avoid turning my jowls to raw hamburger every few days, but I was never satisfied with the results or with how long it took to get those lousy results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a friend told me about shaving oil, this brand in particular. I can shave with a blade every other day and get great results. I use a \\&quot;Mach 3\\&quot; blade and 5 drops of this oil, and that allows me to shave as close as I like, in any direction, with no irritation whatsoever. It&#x27;s also great for shaving my Kojak-style bald head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this stuff smells great, too. It&#x27;s got clove oil and some other fragrant essential oils in it. I think the oils help keep my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that one bottle lasts me several months, in case you are put off by what seems like a high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who shaves with a blade owes it to him/herself to try this stuff.</li>
    <li> A bit strongly scented, but that wasn&#x27;t the problem. My face really didn&#x27;t like switching from a cheaper brand of shaving oil to this one. I will say that it shaved extremely well, maybe just a bit too closely.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter but if you order this model from this company, you actually receive the Ultra version instead.  Works fine and I would recommend using it if you use a safety razor.  Less knicks and blood drawn.</li>
    <li> This oil is not very viscous which I like.  I can put a few drops on my fingers and then rub it into my beard before I put shaving cream on and it helps ensure I don&#x27;t cut myself shaving.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and smooth shave! Better than the razor clogging, Shave Secret.  Shaves as close as with King of Shaves Oils, and I really like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey, but overall worth it!</li>
    <li> Like using the oil for shaving. It&#x27;s a pretty small bottle though. I started using it with my travel toiletry kit. Now I changed to bristle and soap only.</li>
    <li> My husband uses a straight razor and lives by this product!</li>
    <li> Makes shaving much easier. I recommend this to every man who doesnt like shaving. Stops razor burn and makes shaving comfortable.</li>
    <li> Good product that provides a close shave.  It&#x27;s one of the less expensive shave oils on the market and goes along way.  Watch traveling with this bottle as it has a tendency to leak under pressure in aircraft.  I put it in a small snack baggie to protect it from leaking on other items in my luggage.</li>
    <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve used ProRaso brand Pre-shave cream, which I also highly enjoy and recommend, but I decided to try this for a change since I was out of ProRaso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) lubricates the skin in preparation for shaving;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) pleasant smell that is not overly scented or effeminate;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) soothes and relaxes the skin;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) small quantity required to cover the face;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) washes away cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) no camphor/menthol as in ProRaso, so you don&#x27;t get the same cooling tingling feeling (which may not be a disadvantage in your own personal preference);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) does not soften hair follicles as well as ProRaso, but when combined with a quality shave soap, and a fresh, sharp blade, it performs well.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of shaving oils.  This is easily the best. Thick enough to not wash away with water, but not so thick that it feels like motor oil is left on one&#x27;s face.  Great scent.</li>
    <li> After having horrible razor burn from my last shave, I decided it was time to make some changes. After browsing Amazon, I found this product with its excellent reviews, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the product, I was a little upset because I had not noticed it was only 1.7 ounces. The bottle itself is no taller than my thumb is long. I was pretty irritated that I paid $12 for something so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After actually trying it, I can easily say it was the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had. The hair on my neck grows in at a lot of different angles and as a result, I have to go against the grain in order for my neck not to be prickly and looking like I missed a few places. Going against the grain with this was no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, you can feel the drag on your hair when shaving, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any irritation. Cut my shaving time by at least half, and I actually won&#x27;t hate doing it anymore.</li>
    <li> This product works really well and I recommend it to everyone that shaves.  It works best when applied after very hot water and keep fresh hot water during shaving.</li>
    <li> enhance your shaving closeness to the max. make sure you have a good sharp blade when shaving with this product. SMOOTHNESS is the way to go!!</li>
    <li> This shave oil buys you a lot of protection from razor burn and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 or 5 drops on wet skin, worked into the skin on your face, then your regular shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to get a closer shave as well, but the reduction in skin irritation is worth the price alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect it will last 3 to 4 months of regular shaving.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin and whiskers are different. I have tried several shave oils, the same way I&#x27;ve tried several different blades (Feather and Blue Bird work best for me), and several different shave creams (I like Prorasso and Art of Shaving but for the most part I haven&#x27;t found much difference with shave creams). I have never found anything better than this American Crew shave oil, for me, but your skin may vary. I encourage you to try until you find what works for YOU. Without the help of reviewers here, I wouldn&#x27;t have tried American Crew. Share and enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, go ahead and try regular old castor oil or even canola oil. You might find it works great for you. One reviewer certainly does, and what do you have to lose, it&#x27;s in your kitchen right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually first ordered this oil on Amazon from another item, listed as \\&quot;American Crew Essential Shave Oil, 1.7 oz\\&quot;, and ended up receiving this one. I would encourage you to purchase from the product I am reviewing here, because the UPC in this product&#x27;s description matches what is on my box, 738678240472. If AC really does make another product, I would hate to get anything else instead of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shave oils specifically, I have tried the above mentioned American Crew UPC 738678240472, Art of Shaving Pre-Shave Oil (AoS has the BEST Sandalwood scent), and The Body Shop Maca Root Wash Off Shave Oil. The Art of Shaving is the closest to using \\&quot;cooking oil\\&quot; and is actually the most expensive as well. The Ingredients for AoS are: \\&quot;Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Fragrance/Parfum, Water/Aqua, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\\&quot;. I find the AoS Pre-Shave oil to be too thick, and it does NOT protect my skin as well as the American Crew. I have literally compared them side-by-side just to prove I&#x27;m not doing something different from shave to shave. Blood all over the AoS side, smooth shaving on the American Crew side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have mentioned that the flip-top bottle leaks compared to an older style screw-on lid. I have only ever had the flip-top bottle and I don&#x27;t have any problem with it leaking or dripping or making any mess when I use it. I have not traveled on an airplane with it, but based on past experience I would squeeze out a litte air so it is \\&quot;dented\\&quot; and then put this in a plastic bag along with any other leak candidates, in case it does leak.viewers have mentioned that the flip-top bottle leaks compared to an older style screw-on lid.

    <li> I use this with my Braun electric razor to get a closer shave. I suppose that&#x27;s probably not its intended use, but it works for me. I like that the oil is not very thick - it does not clog my razor&#x27;s foil and 3 or 4 drops is enough for my shave. It&#x27;s not the cheapest shave oil out there, but it is one of my favorites (I also really like the Grooming Lounge Beard Master). Also, one bottle lasts me over 6 months of shaving 5 or 6 days per week, so it&#x27;s still a very good value. I generally wash my face, apply a few drops, shave and wash my face again (probably not necessary, but I don&#x27;t like leaving any oil on my mug). Shaving with the oil feels noticeably closer than without. Not as close as a blade shave, but I use the electric because it causes much less irritation. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product, great scent. With a few drops of warm water, this provides a nice oil protective base for shaving. Have used this with a straight, safety, and shavette. Recommend use with Proraso green soap and aftershave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, not great.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin - always had trouble shaving more than every 5-6 days or I get wicked razor burns and bleeding, and sore skin for a few days after shaving.  Heard about this and started using it in addition to American Crew Moisturizing shave cream and now am down to every 3 days.  It has really helped - worth giving a try!  Use a little on wet skin before applying shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This oil is crap! It made my face break out and I got cuts and nicks all over. Do not buy this!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product and was very impressed.  I use safety blades and have very sensitive skin which had been scraped and cut often when using shaving cream.  I now use shave oil alone when shaving - the result is a smooth, close shave, and I never get cut.&lt;br /&gt;So, you are probably wondering about the low rating.  The reason is that I get the exact same results when using canola oil.  Thats right, I went to the pantry and filled a tiny plastic bottle with cooking oil.  My 9 cents of cooking oil works just as well as this $15 product.  This product smells great, but that is the only differentiator.  I would expect something more for $15.</li>
    <li> I read a few reviews before using  this stuff and i agree with some but not others.  With me it works best when applied to my face right out of the shower.  No water 1st.  This way it doesn&#x27;t get diluted so when I apply shaving cream with my brush the oil sticks to my face and tends to make my shave much smoother without razor burn.  It smells great as well and washes off completely.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Shave my head daily and it works great - no clogging like with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is a really good a shave oil. But, I don not know why; when you are applying on you and after a few minutes it dry on you. However it is provide a very close shaving. I will highly recommended to any man who wants to have a very close shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of preshaves and this one falls somewhere in the middle of what I like - wet enough to not dry out while I&#x27;m prepping everything for my shave, and gel-like enough not to run off my face.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and really helps ease the morning shave (I use a safety razor).  I have been experimenting with the particularly sharp Feather blades and find that in combination with a nice pre-shave oil like this one, my shaves have been more nick-free and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> This Shave Oil helps when shaving and it also smells really good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that this doesn&#x27;t exactly have the best smell, but there&#x27;s no question about the results that this shave oil produces.  I have never had a closer shave and I have yet to get any irritation from shaving AGAINST the grain (this was a big problem before for me).  It seems like this is a little pricey, but this will last you quite a while.  My first experience was a family member lending me the last of his bottle thinking he had only a few drops left.  I pulled a good 4 shaves out of that tiny amount. I get a lot of comments from female friends and other women on how smooth my skin looks after a shave.  Do yourself a favor and ditch the gel/foam and pick up a bottle of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have a beard and use this for my neck and cheeks.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I wish I knew about it when I didn&#x27;t have a beard.  It really makes the hair stand up - even just a day or two of stubble.  I used to have razor burn with decent Nivea shaving cream but rarely with this.  This little bottle last a long time too.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Natural ingredients. Lets you see where you&#x27;re shaving. Lasts a long time. Great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell, too.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with a good shave gel, good safety razor &amp; a comforting after shave and I get a smooth shave every time. I&#x27;ve noticed my shave is even closer when using this product. It works very well.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff, and the kind of shave I get with it. For the last two years since switching to shave oil, my &#x27;new&#x27; routine has been to shower, then immediately shave. The results have been great... no more irritation, ingrown hairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue with this particular product is the packaging. The flip top has broken on 2 of the 3 bottles I&#x27;ve bought of the 1.7 oz bottle. If you don&#x27;t travel, this probably wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. In my case, the result was a ziploc baggie full of shaving oil. I don&#x27;t want to belabor the point, but the bottle was inside a ziploc bag, inside my soft sided toiletry kit, inside my suitcase. So while the bottle definitely was subjected to a little rough treatment, I think a weak design of the bottle top also contributed.</li>
    <li> The picture shows ultra glide but description is for essential shave oil. Do not be fooled they are not the same. Ultra glide is awful and dries your skin, it&#x27;s bad for sensitive skin especially.</li>
    <li> The best stand-alone shave oil I&#x27;ve used!  I use it mainly for the last pass to get that baby butt smooth (BBS) shave.</li>
    <li> It love the smell and the feel after the shave.  You could shave without cream or gel. It conditions my skin and allows me to shave quickly and very close.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff! He used to get lots of shaving bumps and then they would get cut open the next time he shaved. Since he started using this a couple of years ago, the bumps are gone!</li>
    <li> I had always used a foaming shave gel. I use this alternately with two other clear shaving oils. This works extremely well as I trim around a full beard. Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Lubricates so well that I found that all my shaving cream was doing was clogging the blades giving me a less close shave.</li>
    <li> This oil goes on smooth, but isn&#x27;t too greasy.  It really helps make the shave smoother and less irritating.  I use it before I use a shave brush and cream.  I get razor bumps on my neck pretty frequently but the combination of oil and a brush has helped that a lot.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different oils, and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  It&#x27;s also reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, difficult to shave beard.&lt;br /&gt;Great for pre-foam layer.&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops on my fingers and rub in well, Then after a couple minutes, I apply foam (Prorasso) with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;Then shave with a two or three blade razor. Gives a great shave, and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I nicked my face when using the oil.&lt;br /&gt;All of this routine takes place int he shower for me - so that the beard stubble remains as soft as possible through to the end of the shave.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to fill out my shaving set with elements that are helpful, and a pre-shave oil was recommended by some.  After 2 months of use, with and without, I can&#x27;t see any real benefit to the oil.  Moisturize after you shave; keep your shaving surface wet with shaving cream; don&#x27;t bother with this.</li>
    <li> I have been using shaving oil for many years for both electric and razor shaving. This product from American Crew rates right up there vis a vis the ones I&#x27;ve used to date. I would have no hesitation in recommending this to others.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for quite awhile and am very happy with it both quality and price wise (says Mr. Buttercup).</li>
    <li> In the photo it says lubricating oil, on the bottle i received it says ultra gliding, so its not what I wanted. I dont know if this was a mistake or if they don&#x27;t make it like that anymore. this oil foams up and dries up my shaving cream also its nothing special, no difference in shaving with out it or with it alone. I bought this to protect my skin and reduce irritation and it has not done that at all. definitely would not recommend this to anyone overpriced garbage.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this brand after using Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s version. This stuff by Crew is thicker and it&#x27;s got something in it that warms up your skin as you rub it in. That&#x27;s a nice touch and it&#x27;s enjoyable. I use it to shave my head and face. If it gets in your eyes though, that is uncomfortable.. it doesn&#x27;t burn, but it&#x27;s like a warmth that makes opening your eyes difficult until you wash it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to go back to Pacific Shaving&#x27;s shave oil for my next purchase as I liked it better.</li>
    <li> I usually break out from shaving but this product really cut down on that. Product helped the blade glide over my skin.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff. He won&#x27;t use anything else to shave with.  He has great skin and it&#x27;s always soft and smells great!</li>
    <li> This is a good preshave oil, but it losses points due to amount of irritation it causes. I living in a dry climate with low humidity which means I require a pre shave that doesn&#x27;t burn when it goes on. This burning is from either menthol or eucalyptus oil, neither are necessarily bad but they can cause skin irritation. The upside is that this is one of the more inexpensive pre shaves on the market, and if I lived in a more humid climate it may work better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a classic shaver using a double edge with brush and shave soap.  Often I&#x27;ve seen others indicate shave oil can make it even better.  Since I was so pleased with the CREW post shave lotion I tried the shave oil.  It smells great and does reduce any areas of razor burn.  Amazon sellers offer it at a very good price compare to local barber or hair cutting salons.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shave oil for a long time.  It works better for me than any others I have tried.  This Lubricating Shave Oil should not be confused with the Ultra Gliding Shave Oil.  They are not the same.  There are different ingredients and for me do not produce the same results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He has a beard but tidies up his neck and cheeks with an old-fashioned safety razor and Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream (highly recommended as well) about once a week. He normally gets terrible razor burn, and this has made a HUGE difference. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Ive only tried 2 other brands which I won&#x27;t name but this oil is far superior.  Expensive but you don&#x27;t need much.  A bottle should last you over a year.</li>
    <li> The only way to shave. I&#x27;ve tried everything, and it&#x27;s way closer and more comfortable than creams, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also put some into a sample container of eye-drops (free: see your optometrist), for travel.</li>
    <li> Much better than Art of Shaving! Gave me an incredibly smooth shave much cheeper than Art of Shaving oil too!</li>
    <li> I love this shave oil. I have the lovely combination of a very (very) coarse beard and very (very) sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried about five different brands/kinds, and like this one the best:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Slippery without being heavy&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Seems to disperse well&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Pleasant and unique scent that also doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;&gt; A bottle lasts more than 6 months, shaving 3 - 4 times a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Criticisms:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; I use more than a drop or two - probably four or five&lt;br /&gt;&gt; As others have observed, the bottle tends to leak under airplane pressure, checked or carry-on. This is true with the old screw-on style cap and the newer flip top. I simply wrap a tissue around the top. It doesn&#x27;t leak a ton (even on my 16-hour flight to Australia), just a little bit, but if you aren&#x27;t careful everything in your toiletry bag will be slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for years and it&#x27;s my favorite. Every time I go to order a couple of bottles I&#x27;m afraid they will have discontinued it or something, so please: buy it so that they keep making it!</li>
    <li> Works fine, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell.  It&#x27;s not necessarily strong, but just a smell-- and it&#x27;s right at your nose, so you can&#x27;t avoid it.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot for work and never check my bag so I&#x27;m always looking for products that meet TSA baggage policy. This is small enough to take on board and provides a very close smooth shave. Follow the instructions, use a few drops, rub in to beard, leave until it begins to tingle, and then you are ready for a close shave. Even though it&#x27;s a small bottle you only need a few drops for each shave so last for several weeks.</li>
    <li> Gave off a strange scent, and actually irritated my skin more than soothed it. Not as effective as Nivea or Dove after shave balm.</li>
    <li> I use this product after I wet my face. It gives extra protection from the razor or bumps when I lather up with traditional soap cream. I like it; however, it is not a must in my collection of shaving tools.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this to try because he has sensitive skin. He really loves it!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but this oil does make a big difference in the closeness of the shave in the mornings. I use both Schick Hydro 5 razors and Gillette Fusions along with Proraso shaving cream (now sold by C.O. Bigelow in the States), and adding this one quick step prior to putting on the shaving cream has made my morning shave much more enjoyable. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving creams, lotions and oils. Best shaving oil I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> The OIL is perfect for that perfect close shave.  I have used it for years and found it very soothing.</li>
    <li> Works well to soften a beard or moustache, just wet beard slightly, take a dab of this oil and rub in.  It will feel instantly less bristly.  Has a sort of faint peppermint smell to it, my wife doesn&#x27;t care for, so exercise caution with significant other.</li>
    <li> This oil give a great smooth shave, but for me I was breaking out with acnes after using it for 3-5 days.  As soon as I quit using it the acnes went away.</li>
    <li> small but does not take much. In my opinion over priced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all type of shaving creams, oils, soaps, etc. I was using a brush and mug just before I switched back to an oil. American Crew Ultra Gliding Shave Oil is OUTSTANDING. It isn&#x27;t too thick and it smell great. Furthermore, the price is excellent for the quality. I also like King of Shaves Alpha Oil and it is sold in a small bottle that is perfect for my travel kit, but American Crew is a better oil for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you&#x27;ve never used a shave oil, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised at how luxurious a shave you&#x27;ll get. Give American Crew a try!</li>
    <li> Need more quantity applied than small bottle implies but I like the smell and feel.  Just that small bottle applies that much less is needed than is the case.</li>
