<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just what I needed. Thanks</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule</li>
    <li> I could not find Blue Magic locally for my waterbed.  This was a great buy, 5 bottles for what 1 would have been locally, if they&#x27;d had it in stock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  It actually made my wife&#x27;s hair look a little better but we don&#x27;t feel it held up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
    <li> Does the job very well...this is a must for waterbeds.  I apply every 6 months to the water and it eliminates bubbles and odors.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to receive as promised the 5 bottles of water bed conditioner.  They were sealed properly and as I opened each one to add to the water they had the same color, smell, and familiarity as I remembered the Blue Magic product.  I felt confident my purchase was secure and had no buyers remorse.</li>
    <li> This blue magic water conditioner did what it was supposed to do, the bed smelled much better the very next day.thanks</li>
    <li> Have had a waterbed for many years and have always treated the water with this product.  It works!</li>
    <li> i needed conditioner.  This was available.  How do you really know if it works?  If you don&#x27;t use it will the mattress explode?  I would rather use the conditioner than find out.</li>
    <li> We ordered 5 bottles of Blue Magic Waterbed Conditioner because we couldn&#x27;t find any in town any more. The bottles came within 7-10 days. Only we ordered them in December and the bottles came frozen. They didn&#x27;t expload or anything we just had to let them thaw out. So just remember when ordering don&#x27;t order anything that can&#x27;t be frozen without being ruined. Overall we were very satisfied with everything. Easy going through Amazon.com. We will order this product again.</li>
    <li> NO PROBLEMS -- RECEIVED AS PROMISED, IN FACT FASTER THAN EXPECTED.  EASY TO USE. GOOD PRICE WITH NO CONCERNS.</li>
    <li> needed it found it on amazon and we ordered it not problems and all good</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it has given good service. The delivery was even better than the product, showing up two days earlier than promised. Amazon did great again.</li>
    <li> I had just emptied my bed to repair the frame.  I figured this would be a good time to add the conditioner.  Unfortunatly no one in town carries waterbed conditioner. Did some checking on line and found this on Amazon, of course!&lt;br /&gt;The box arrived faster than expected and was at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I was excited to find the product I need on amazon--and for such a reasonable price. Received accurate product,as advertized &amp; order was received in an extremely timely manner!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the compact packaging and the timely arrival of this product. I was pleased to have 5 bottles of conditioner for my water bed at this good price.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s not eating my waterbed.  And neither does it smell.  So it must be doing its job.  Used it in my fiberbed since 2003.  Still is a great</li>
    <li> This is the conditioner I have been using for my beds.  Don&#x27;t plan on changing and can ger it here at a great price!</li>
    <li> I PAID THE SAME FOR 5 BOTTLES THAT MY BROTHER PAID FOR 1. I RECEIVED IN GOOD CONDITION IN A REASONABLE LENGTH OF TIME.</li>
    <li> This is a real bargain.  I needed this amount and got the 5 bottles for less than 1 would sell for at another source.</li>
    <li> In the past I have purchased larger bottles from the store, it is nice that these are more concentrated and I can keep a stock so I don&#x27;t have to run out and buy them all the time.</li>
    <li> If you love your waterbed, use this.</li>
    <li> Finding this type of product in stores is becoming more and more difficult. I ordered it and it arrived in a timely manor. I have used this product in the past and rely on it to keep my mattress in good condition for years to come.</li>
    <li> The Blue Magic Waterbed Conditioner arrived quickly and met my expectations. I have used this brand for many years and have been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Did the job and a good price</li>
    <li> The only shortcoming I&#x27;ve had so far (after several months) with this is that the mattress still has to be burped every few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have a waterbed and this is what I bought for it, works good. more words and stuff. 2 more.</li>
    <li> Product appears as advertised.  Would prefer that directions be in larger print and more explicit -- what size mattress does 1-4oz bottle treat for 12 or 18 months?</li>
    <li> seems to be what the seller offered and what I needed at a great price.  I love my waterbed.</li>
    <li> Works fine, prompt delivery</li>
    <li> I have been using Blue Magic since the 70&#x27;s when I got my waterbed.  Seems to do the trick</li>
    <li> our water bed is at least 15 years old , I put the salutation in every 6 months and add some water some time.</li>
    <li> I would recommend that anyone who owns a waterbed to be sure to use a conditioner.  It does help especially when you need to open the valve for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Everything was as stated in ad, got the conditioner fast, packaged well, works excellent! This is a good Service! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good buy on waterbed conditioner. But, should come as a six pack, for three applications in a king size waterbed.</li>
    <li> good quality and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Quick response and shipment. Price was good and low. Product was exactly what was advertised and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> DID WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. SHIP TIME WAS QUICK.A A A A A A A A A A</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of conditioner for many years, and  have been pleased with it.  I can no longer purchase it anywhere in our area, thus the reason for ordering.  I have recommended this to my friends.  I will order again, when I need more conditioner. Shipping was very quick.</li>
    <li> This product keeps your mattress fresh and mold free as promised and is a great value in general.  I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Great price on this product.  Seems to do it&#x27;s job. I had no issues with this product.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> This waterbed conditioner is easy to use, and since our local source is no longer in business, the ability to purchase online is great.</li>
    <li> Use it about once a quarter...good for waterbed.  Doesn&#x27;t smell, keeps the bubbles out of the bed.  Good buy, hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> This is a good value, Thanks again</li>
    <li> Gem find..not many waterbed owners left..so finding this conditioner was a steal..</li>
    <li> I use these every six months for our son&#x27;s waterbed.  these work well and are easy to use. Will be buying them again.</li>
    <li> Since I can&#x27;t find this in any local store, this is a really easy way to take care of my bed.</li>
    <li> Just  what I needed to maintain my  water  in my waterbed.</li>
    <li> this works great on acne very satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> Great price.. great product.</li>
    <li> Waterbed fluid.  It works great.</li>
    <li> Item was easy to use Thank you so much! Item came just as expected from this place would order from again in the future. My household still has a water bed in it and I can&#x27;t say that I love the new mattresses out their. The bottles will come in handy when it comes time to use again! Just put the contents of  1 bottle in the waterbed and add more water and you will have a nice waterbed.</li>
    <li> This product seem to be better than the one I was using before I bought this one. It is cheaper too.</li>
    <li> water bed conditioner is getting harder to find and when you do, it can be very expensive.  So I was happy to find a choice on Amazon that would work.  They arrived fast and are what is needed for someone with a waterbed.</li>
    <li> I need to order more.  This is such a difficult item to find.  How nice it is to have a 5 pack.</li>
    <li> Who knows if this really works cuz let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;m not going to pour out some water and drink it or anything. But there&#x27;s no smell or discoloration of the water so I&#x27;m taking it on faith that it works. Besides, thinking about only a thin layer of plastic between me and nasty putrid water isn&#x27;t something I care to consider...so in my mind, this is working beyond excellently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll let you know if one day something out of a B-rated soylent green flick osmosisizes out of the bed. Then I&#x27;ll definitely change my rating...well, if I have time to get to the computer before my fingers dissolve on the keyboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must...not...op0000oooo0000ooooooooooarrrrgggggg..............</li>
    <li> i paid less and got more. I filled my cal king bed up once and i still have 3 bottles to spare. Not to minchin my package is delevered on time.</li>
    <li> Water beds are out of popularity, making finding chemicals difficult.  This is the right stuff and I am thankful that it is still available.</li>
    <li> The seller did a good job of selling their great product to me.</li>
    <li> Have finally gotten my new waterbed  mattress on and put Blue Magic in the water.Have used Blue Magic for years. Keeps the water clear and smelling ok</li>
    <li> Product was as promised, at a fair price, and delivered promptly.  Would by again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I have using Blue Magic for years in my soft sided waterbed and have no problems with it. Seems to do as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great price,not available in stores. Workes to keep water clear also to keep waterbed material soft and plyable.One bottle last up to six months.</li>
    <li> Yup! It&#x27;s waterbed conditioner... It worked like it should work.  Boy I am thrilled? How much can you say about waterbed conditioner?</li>
    <li> It did well contring the water</li>
    <li> great  buy , hard to find in area, thank you</li>
    <li> This item is hard to find and it was a great price.  Thanks</li>
