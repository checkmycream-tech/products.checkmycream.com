      <li>I went out that night to get some more myself.</li>
      <li>I love OPI Avoplwx exfoliating cuticle cream.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite places to go shop.</li>
      <li>my nails look so much better</li>
      <li>The original tube still contains some product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, works great, just use in the evening and rinse afterward if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The bottle shape and applicator make it easy to apply in crevices.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Stuff is great, you only need to use it a couple times a week so even if you forget the oil youll be okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this cuticle treatment and the Avoplex hand cream for a few years and they are excellent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>and I had to find a new supply on my own.  </li>
      <li>have tried different cuticle products and Avoplex Cuticle Exfoliating Cuticle Treatment is by far the best product I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle (1 fl oz.)</li>
      <li>Works Great to hydrate and exfoliate my dry cuticles.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really helping to soften them up and make them look and feel much better.</li>
      <li>Working really well, nails looking well manicured and neat, all by myself.  :-)</li>
      <li>They are soft and flexible and look nice as well.</li>
      <li>The bottle applicator is easy to use placing the right amount in the right location.  </li>
      <li>The exfoliant absorbs into cuticles quickly and moisturizes immediately.</li>
      <li>But, I was surprised upon purchasing this to find that it was more a cream based product than an oil.  </li>
      <li>Definitely takes away from a nice manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Loosens them right up for clipping.  </li>
      <li>It works very quickly and better than any other product I have used.</li>
      <li>OPI has done it again with the Avoplex  very gentle cuticle remover.</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>I use this everyday to keep my fast growing cuticles looking good.</li>
      <li>I wash dishes by hand and clean with bare hands because I forget to put on gloves or am in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>It really cleaned my cuticles.</li>
      <li>Really keeps them in check and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Really absorbs into cuticles and moisturizes them.</li>
      <li>and I really like this stuff</li>
      <li>I have not found this to do much of anything at all.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, will use this service again.  </li>
      <li>It still has a good moisturizing effect for my cuticles, it&#x27;s just different than what I expected.  </li>
      <li>but it is this same ingredient that provides such effective exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>This is a decent product, but the oil way outdid it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild yet actually does the job without &amp;#34;over processing.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Not sure if I&#x27;d consider this an exfoliator in the traditional sense, but it&#x27;s great if you have super dry cuticles like I do.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;particular</li>
      <li>I also use this on my toes as well and the effects are the same.&lt;br /&gt;The one ounce size lasts fairly long, but I am recommending the larger size because it is a better value.</li>
      <li>It makes it super easy to push back cuticles or to cut them off although its not healthy to have your cuticles cut as it exposes you to bacteria entering the nail bed and not to mention they hurt and bleed if cut off too much.</li>
      <li>I was very surprised in the reduction of hangnails</li>
      <li>and sometimes my skin is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic, I wash my hands multiple times a day and my cuticles stay dry.</li>
      <li>They are scented a little - light lemony scent - but I&#x27;ve never had any reaction to either</li>
      <li>This is a good cuticle treatment - I am back at taking care of such things, so this is helpful - dab a little on every day - makes a big difference!</li>
      <li>I thought at first this was the same product just in a different style package.  </li>
      <li>I use to find this at local store and hadn&#x27;t seen it in a long time, so I tried other products and wasn&#x27;t pleased...</li>
      <li>This treatment has really helped my dry cuticles.</li>
      <li>Daily usage insures that the cuticles remain not only soft but translusent as well.</li>
      <li>Love this product, as usual OPI doesn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>

<li> prefer to use a cuticle remover to eliminate rough spots around my nails and push my cuticles back.</li>
<li> I then moisturize well using Avoplex Cuticle Exfoliating Cuticle Treatment and remove any leftover dry skin.</li>
<li> When I do woodworking my hands can get very dry, and when they get dry my cuticles get even drier.  </li>
<li> Amazon sells it for less than local stores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used several products over the years to strengthen my nails. I am hard on my hands and nails on a daily basis. This is the best product I have ever used. I put it in every night before I go to bed and my nails are beautiful. You will see a difference in one week.</li>
    <li> I love OPI Avoplwx exfoliating cuticle cream. I keeps my cuticles looking tidy and neat. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product, the price and the seller.  Fast delivery, will use this service again.  One of my favorite places to go shop.</li>
    <li> this is amazing !!! and will buy again thnx</li>
    <li> Love this item Received yesterday. Would do business with again. AA++</li>
    <li> With the use of OPI Avoplex exfoliating cuticle treatment my cuticle are healing.  My husband uses it too.</li>
    <li> perfect for my cuticle</li>
    <li> This is great cuticle treatment.  Loosens them right up for clipping.  I use to find this at local store and hadn&#x27;t seen it in a long time, so I tried other products and wasn&#x27;t pleased...I thought this had gone off the market.  I was so happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> Great price and service</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! OPI is the bomb! This stuff works really good! All their products are usually good.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  The bottle applicator is easy to use placing the right amount in the right location.  The gel cream is neat staying where you put it til rubbed in.  Not there is a glycolic acid ingredient which did cause some temporary tingling and redness on my fingertips but it is this same ingredient that provides such effective exfoliation.  I did rinse the product off although I note others writing here do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, works great, just use in the evening and rinse afterward if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The product keeps cuticles in really good shape; dispenses easily...smells pretty too! Would order again and would also refer to a friend/</li>
    <li> When I do woodworking my hands can get very dry, and when they get dry my cuticles get even drier.  When that happens I get painful cracking of the skin around my nails.  A number of years ago a woman in my life introduced me to cuticle oil to help relieve this when it happens.  That little supply lasted a very long time for me.  But, it ran out and I had to find a new supply on my own.  I thought at first this was the same product just in a different style package.  But, I was surprised upon purchasing this to find that it was more a cream based product than an oil.  It still has a good moisturizing effect for my cuticles, it&#x27;s just different than what I expected.  I run a small amount of this product along my cuticles and then rub it in with my other hand once a day until the cracking goes away and then once every few days as needed until whatever woodworking project I&#x27;m doing is done and it keeps me from having that painful cracking of the skin.  I also found a bottle of the oil and keep that at home while this now resides in my desk at work.  That way I don&#x27;t have to explain a nail polish looking container at work.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised in the reduction of hangnails my nails look so much better my hands look great the cuticles feel great and I really like this stuff the only problem I had was that it was in a squeeze bottle because I&#x27;m disabled and only have one hand with enough strength to squeeze the product out</li>
    <li> (I bought both) and really love the Avoplex oil MUCH better. This is a decent product, but the oil way outdid it.</li>
    <li> I have not found this to do much of anything at all.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of trouble with extra dry, cracking cuticles. This stuff is really helping to soften them up and make them look and feel much better.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday to keep my fast growing cuticles looking good. I also use the hand lotion and cuticle oil at home and the travel version when on the road.</li>
    <li> This is different. Not a once a week treatment, this has AHA&#x27;s in it, and you massage it  into your cuticles several times a week to get them, then keep them looking neat. A different approach to a problem I have all the time. Working really well, nails looking well manicured and neat, all by myself.  :-)</li>
    <li> I received this item and I love it. It really cleaned my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I was getting a manicure the great time they used this on me.  Its great! I went out that night to get some more myself. I&#x27;ve been using it weekly since.</li>
    <li> Years ago (about 8) I worked at a hair salon as a receptionist while I went to college.  I purchased this product since I am prone to getting hangnails.  The original tube still contains some product! And guess what?! It WORKS! I highly recommend this product for men and women that would like softer cuticles and less hangnails.</li>
    <li> Love this product, as usual OPI doesn&#x27;t let me down.  I apply this before pushing back my cuticles and also on the rough skin around the nails; leave this in for about 5 minutes and wipe off.  It makes it super easy to push back cuticles or to cut them off although its not healthy to have your cuticles cut as it exposes you to bacteria entering the nail bed and not to mention they hurt and bleed if cut off too much.</li>
    <li> OPI has done it again with the Avoplex  very gentle cuticle remover. You can use this 2 or 3 times a week. Really keeps them in check and moisturized. All of the Avoplex line has been wonderful and does what it says.</li>
    <li> Works Great to hydrate and exfoliate my dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cuticle treatment. It works very quickly and better than any other product I have used. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love this - it works wonders on your cuticles.</li>
    <li> This treatment has really helped my dry cuticles.</li>

The bottle shape and applicator make it easy to apply in crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a fan of Opi Avoplex Nail and Cuticle Replenishing Oil, which I apply after the exfoliating treatment. Personally, my manicures have improved and my nails look healthier since starting an OPI nail care routine.</li>
    <li> This Stuff is great, you only need to use it a couple times a week so even if you forget the oil youll be okay. it works better with oil though.</li>
    <li> This is a good cuticle treatment - I am back at taking care of such things, so this is helpful - dab a little on every day - makes a big difference!</li>

    <li> Keeps my cuticles nice.</li>
    <li> Great! It&#x27;s mild yet actually does the job without &amp;#34;over processing.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is my go to for my cuticle exfoliation. OPI really makes great products. No complaints from here</li>
    <li> This is my product of choice for healthy cuticles. I have tried many and this works the best. Amazon sells it for less than local stores.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for moisturizing cuticles. I try to use it after every manicure, twice weekly. (sometimes I&#x27;m not as good about it as I should be) It&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells amazing. It&#x27;s actually a pleasure to use and feels like pampering. It keeps my cuticles looking nice, and I keep a backup at all times. :)</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> OPI is the best in nail, cuticle and hand cream products.  I highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;particular product for the cuticle.</li>
    <li> Really absorbs into cuticles and moisturizes them. Not sure if I&#x27;d consider this an exfoliator in the traditional sense, but it&#x27;s great if you have super dry cuticles like I do.</li>
    <li> I initially received this product as a gift in a holiday set of OPI products. My cuticles often used to look somewhat crusty and rough. Eeeew! Definitely takes away from a nice manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this daily at bedtime, massaging into my cuticles. Daily usage insures that the cuticles remain not only soft but translusent as well. I no longer experience tough or bleeding cuticles. They are soft and flexible and look nice as well. I also use this on my toes as well and the effects are the same.&lt;br /&gt;The one ounce size lasts fairly long, but I am recommending the larger size because it is a better value.</li>
    <li> Could not find it in my town.  So pleased,</li>
    <li> I wash dishes by hand and clean with bare hands because I forget to put on gloves or am in a hurry.  So, my hands and cuticles are badly mistreated!  I&#x27;ve used this cuticle treatment and the Avoplex hand cream for a few years and they are excellent.  Very effective without being too greasy.  They are scented a little - light lemony scent - but I&#x27;ve never had any reaction to either and sometimes my skin is very sensitive.</li>
