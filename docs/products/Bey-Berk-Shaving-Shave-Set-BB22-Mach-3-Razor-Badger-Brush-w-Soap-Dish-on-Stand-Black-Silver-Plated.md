      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of lathering my face.</li>
      <li>The product was very good.</li>
      <li>Great brush and a Mach 3 razor.</li>
      <li>and it was great.</li>
      <li>It looks great.</li>
      <li>but the brush is great.</li>
      <li>Product was in great condition and was as described.</li>
      <li>I have had this shaving set for almost a year and up until two days ago loved it.  </li>
      <li>The brush whips up a nice lather and feels good and the razor gives a great shave as well as feeling good in the hand.</li>
      <li>The set performs as good as it looks.  </li>
      <li>The stand, brush, and razor handle are good quality.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would be a good purchase.</li>
      <li>He loved the style.  </li>
      <li>Get some good shave soap</li>
      <li>A good find for the price.</li>
      <li>The badger brush is great, haven&#x27;t had too many hairs fall out either.</li>
      <li>Having been using this for some time I do like the shave I get, and having a brush for soap is nice.</li>
      <li>The razor that it comes with is nice, but he didn&#x27;t like the feel/balance of it.  </li>
      <li>The handle for the razor is nice, the texture, and the weight.</li>
      <li>I also really liked the razor handle</li>
      <li>Very modern and beautiful.</li>
      <li>The badger brush is nice and even though the head on the handle had more flex or movement than a stock Mach 3 head, I got used to it</li>
      <li>I am glad the razor takes the Mach 3.</li>
      <li>but I will be trying to get a better quality brush.</li>
      <li>At first the shaving kit looked good.</li>
      <li>but it is still in pretty good condition after a couple months.</li>
      <li>It is old school and works great.</li>
      <li>so far, great investment</li>
      <li>I got this for my fiancee for our anniversary and he loved it so much he couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  </li>
      <li>kinda cheap metal</li>
      <li>I filled the hole in the handle and put the brush make in ...</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m in the process of finding a replacement ceramic bowl or mug that will fit in the dish</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s only had it a couple weeks but says it is great.</li>
      <li>Crappy product, the razor is ok, but the chrome soap bowl rusted in one day (no exaggeration) because after using it for the first time, a drop of water remained at the bottom-immedately rusted.</li>
      <li>He is certainly shaving more since I got it for him</li>
      <li>the brush is ok but the stand was lopsided and promptly broke when i tried to bend it straight.</li>
      <li>Over all it is not a bad purchase</li>
      <li>It is practical because the brush can drip into the soap rather than onto the sink top, and takes a relatively inexpensive cartridge (but I would have preferred the even more inexpensive Trac II).</li>
      <li>It is pretty, practical and comparatively inexpensive.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The razor has a nice weight to it, the brush could be a little heavier though.</li>
      <li>However, I really purchased this for the badger brush with I found underwhelming.</li>
      <li>Not so much</li>
      <li>He loves the classic look and loves the shaving brush.  </li>
      <li>It is put together well, and the brush is high quality.</li>
      <li>He says the brush is very soft.  </li>
      <li>Overall I haven&#x27;t ended up using this product as often as I was intending since other shaving products do a better job.</li>
      <li>and I saw that the inside of the bowl underneath the soap was completely corroded.  </li>
      <li>I do not use the soap dish as the shaving soap I purchase is it&#x27;s own dish, and just from the few times it has gotten wet it is discolored.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Though everything else is fine with the set, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because of the poor quality dish.  </li>

    <li> kinda cheap metal but the brush is great.</li>
    <li> The shave set is as advertised. It is pretty, practical and comparatively inexpensive. It is practical because the brush can drip into the soap rather than onto the sink top, and takes a relatively inexpensive cartridge (but I would have preferred the even more inexpensive Trac II). The set cost less than the price I have seen in catalogs for the badger brush alone.</li>
    <li> I bought the set as a birthday gift for my boyfriend, and he loves it. He&#x27;s only had it a couple weeks but says it is great. It is put together well, and the brush is high quality.</li>
    <li> I gave this set to my husband as a Christmas gift.  He loved the style.  The brush and bowl work wonderful.  The razor that it comes with is nice, but he didn&#x27;t like the feel/balance of it.  He just stuck with his regular razor.</li>
    <li> I Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is very happy with it loves the razor and shaving bowl.  He says the brush is very soft.  so far, great investment</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiancee for our anniversary and he loved it so much he couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  He loves the classic look and loves the shaving brush.  He is certainly shaving more since I got it for him</li>
    <li> Having been using this for some time I do like the shave I get, and having a brush for soap is nice. I do not use the soap dish as the shaving soap I purchase is it&#x27;s own dish, and just from the few times it has gotten wet it is discolored. The bristles in the brush started falling out day one, and I lose two or three each shave. The handle for the razor is nice, the texture, and the weight. Over all it is not a bad purchase but I will be trying to get a better quality brush.</li>
    <li> Crappy product, the razor is ok, but the chrome soap bowl rusted in one day (no exaggeration) because after using it for the first time, a drop of water remained at the bottom-immedately rusted. the brush is ok but the stand was lopsided and promptly broke when i tried to bend it straight. spend the extra money on something from a quality company like Caswell Massey or something. (my two cents)</li>
    <li> It looks great. Very modern and beautiful. I also really liked the razor handle I already knew I would like the Mach 3 blade. However, I really purchased this for the badger brush with I found underwhelming. It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of lathering my face. Overall I haven&#x27;t ended up using this product as often as I was intending since other shaving products do a better job. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I purchased as a gift for my husband and was sad to see it rusted pretty much immediately.  Now I have little rust spots on my counter!  I guess maybe if you dried it completely after each use that problem could be avoided. Shaving kits get wet!  Poor quality product.</li>
    <li> This set looks slick in my bathroom. It is old school and works great. The badger brush is great, haven&#x27;t had too many hairs fall out either. I am glad the razor takes the Mach 3. It is one of the best heads for the money. Get some good shave soap and you are all set!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for a while now, and it&#x27;s clear the metals aren&#x27;t the highest quality (they chip, scratch, and bend a little) but it is still in pretty good condition after a couple months. A good find for the price.</li>
    <li> At first the shaving kit looked good. There has been some shedding of the bristles. Within a few weeks, the base of the holder has rusted and stained my ceramic tile. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> The product was very good. It was exactly what I was looking for. I gave it as a gift and it was great. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The razor holder broke when I opened up the box....I thought this would be a good purchase. Not so much</li>
    <li> The set performs as good as it looks.  The brush whips up a nice lather and feels good and the razor gives a great shave as well as feeling good in the hand.</li>
    <li> Product was in great condition and was as described. The razor has a nice weight to it, the brush could be a little heavier though.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaving set for almost a year and up until two days ago loved it.  The stand, brush, and razor handle are good quality.  The badger brush is nice and even though the head on the handle had more flex or movement than a stock Mach 3 head, I got used to it and it shaves great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grief is with the soap bowl.  After almost a year my fancy French soap finally wore down and I saw that the inside of the bowl underneath the soap was completely corroded.  The silver plating had dissovled and the bowl severly rusted.  I tried to clean out the rust and still use the bowl with my new soap, but when I lathered it just made a nasty rust-colored lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the rest of the stand so I&#x27;m in the process of finding a replacement ceramic bowl or mug that will fit in the dish holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though everything else is fine with the set, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because of the poor quality dish.  Go with a ceramic bowl if possible.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great brush and a Mach 3 razor. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I orginially posted a review in January 2013 and never heard a thing ... !!!!!  The bulb of the brush fell out of the handle ... was not a good solid, completed glue job from the maker.  I filled the hole in the handle and put the brush make in ... seems to be holding now.  I have not had the reported rusting problem with the bowl ... I have not taken the shaving soap out so it may be there and the black part of the razor handle turns on the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product again and I will not purchase another product offered by Bey-Berk ...</li>
    <li> it became rusty after 3 months!!</li>
