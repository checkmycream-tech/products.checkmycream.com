      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay manikin.</li>
      <li>She is ok the one I got in my cosmetology kit</li>
      <li>but in a good way cuz that is very realistic.</li>
      <li>Hair that is easy to catch and braid.</li>
      <li>this item is easily 2B,2C hair type.</li>
      <li>The hair is fine, but strong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve washed it and braided it and styled it and have had a good time learning new hairstyles with it.</li>
      <li>You can place it on a mannequin stand just fine.  </li>
      <li>Lol yes Amazon we are observant and notice the manipulation in mannequin to give the impression of nappy hair when in fact its Indian, Spanish hair like texture;but</li>
      <li>And definetly get the holder to secure her on.</li>
      <li>will come in very handy as my daughter goes to back to school this semester ...</li>
      <li>Love this,it was exactly like they described...</li>
      <li>I was very excited when I first opened the box.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m inexperienced with doing hair, so this was a great head to start with.</li>
      <li>i colored sooo many times braids the whole nine yards and its still wonderfuk</li>
      <li>The first one had fine hair and my daughter learned to curl, wash, cut.  </li>
      <li>so i dont think it would be wise to do so much on the head so frequently.</li>
      <li>The product was ok, don&#x27;t expect it to be useful for very long since the hair on the head comes out very easily.</li>
      <li>Lets be real, how many Afro-American willing to donate hair for a doll?</li>
      <li>The seller was great received the package within a few days.</li>
      <li>If u want to learn how to braid, i so far would recommend it. :-)</li>
      <li>Hmmm makes you wonder, well maybe because consumers request for a more natural afro hair texture but instead the mannequin has Indian hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m lookin at her right now as shesits on my shelf.</li>
      <li>i washed it right after i got it</li>
      <li>Her hair is tangled, matted and shedding right out of the box.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to finally get a real manakin head, that had the right texture hair similar to mine own, to be able to style and show off to my friends and family.</li>
      <li>Rather comical but ide prefer more of Afro black texture</li>
      <li>aside from that its soft wavy hair and easily detangle during the Loreal power moisture conditioner application.</li>
      <li>this is pretty nice but its not realistic for the majority of people who braid their hair..</li>
      <li>This is the first thing she grabs in the morning and</li>
      <li>The first time i used her there was hair all over the table</li>
      <li>It is very soft not giving the hold that is needed and was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Misleading if you have the same kind of need I did.  </li>
      <li>and then you&#x27;ll be able to move on to more complex designs.</li>
      <li>in and two different dolls being displayed above type of  games, its all good.</li>
      <li>Nice manikin, however the hair does shed a little.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I must add when received the doll, I was ecstatic, my mannequin appeared to have been through a whole lot, as if dumped in the dumpster while it was rotating all in attempt to make this Indian texture hair nappy.</li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>but it mimics what real hair would do anyways</li>
      <li>The hair is much like a sister that takes care of her hair.</li>
      <li>The picture and description are very misleading.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;black people &amp;#34; hair, but I kinda figured it wouldnt be</li>
      <li>the hair is a nice length and comes past the neck when braided.</li>
      <li>I bought this afro manikin head because I need a kinky texture to do certain braids styles and natural style.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Got this for my little sisters and they love it.</li>
      <li>Her hair was very soft.</li>
      <li>this mannequin is great for learning how to braid/cornrow but the hair is not as thick as the african american texture that one would expect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually a head full and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Naughty&amp;#34; texture helps me maintain the different styles I maybe going for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First let me say, as you can see the hair is curly but not like  kinky knot curly as afro hair, basically this hair has  been set with a cold wave perm and small rollers manageable ha when wet not like afro kinky tight hair just to help guide you to learn how to braid with im biracial Hair. I wet the hair and the texture is nothing like afro just appear that way. How do you show pictures help please</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gigt for my daughter.  She was very happy so I was happy.  Arrived in three days and in very good condition. Thanks</li>
    <li> The seller was great received the package within a few days. Manikin looks like the pic there&#x27;s several grey hairs through out the manikins head. The hair is too nappy to handle for me. It&#x27;s so nappy you can&#x27;t really style the manikin&#x27;s hair :( that the only negative thing i will say about this product.</li>
    <li> She has beautiful hair when she arrives her hair looks like it does on the pic. I straightened it I braided it in to a mohawk and I gave her some curls, shes perfect for anystyle. And she photagraphs well. I&#x27;m lookin at her right now as shesits on my shelf. just got her ystrday and I frickin LOVE her. My boyfriend didn&#x27;t think I cld taim her hair... I showed him..lol</li>
    <li> The Naomi was exactly perfect for my needs. It&#x27;s actually a head full and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Naughty&amp;#34; texture helps me maintain the different styles I maybe going for. Like any other manikin, over brushing and combing does cause shedding but what hair doesn&#x27;t??? This is one manikin I&#x27;m glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> I purchased this manikin to help me improve on my braiding skills. The hair is soft and manageable which is a perfect practice head for braiding.</li>
    <li> I can see why there aren&#x27;t many reviews on this doll head, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The manikin (sorry if misspelled) is very pretty, looks just like the picture. The hair is fine, but strong. I have really learned how to perfect my braiding on this doll head, but beware as with any doll head the hair will begin to fall out with over-manipulation, so I bring her out every once in a while. Great for the Price!!</li>
    <li> The hair gets tangled like mine, but that&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s like mine. The texture is not like mine, and it&#x27;s not afro-like.</li>
    <li> will come in very handy as my daughter goes to back to school this semester ...she can&#x27;t wait</li>
    <li> This mannequin head seems  wonderful, it has great texture and feeling to it until you start to blowdry then u have patches of hair fall out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for school to practice on.  Nice manikin, however the hair does shed a little.</li>
    <li> i dont think that any one should pay this amount of money for this head. when it came in the mail it was in great shape and the hair was so soft.the hair was more in a curly hair texture instead of afro. nd i washed it right after i got it and i straightened it . after i did that the hair instantly started tangleing and went to a major fail.now i dont do anything to it anymore. the hair is not soft and feels roughlike.</li>
    <li> Her hair sheds so bad. The first time i used her there was hair all over the table and there was a ball of hair on the floor. It also seems like there are some synthetic pieces of hair mixed in, because her hair melted a few times while trying to straighten it.</li>
    <li> Her hair is really nice. I bought her to learn how to braid and create some designs for my personal use. I was in between buying the synthetic hair manikin . I&#x27;m glad I bought this one.</li>
    <li> I love this Manikin! I used it for a school project and I got an A. LOL But the hair is really good. I&#x27;m gonna upload pics of how it looks washed, conditioned and in braids.</li>
    <li> this mannequin is great for learning how to braid/cornrow but the hair is not as thick as the african american texture that one would expect. the hair also sheds alot due to manipulation so i dont think it would be wise to do so much on the head so frequently. the hair is a nice length and comes past the neck when braided. great product to have for learning to braid.</li>
    <li> I am black and i keep my hair natural... this aint it. Its just a doll with a perm no corsness was added. The curls are too loose. Naming her Naomi and painting her black doesn&#x27;t make her hair kinky. At least the density is decent and she withstand heat well.</li>
    <li> mannequin is great i colored sooo many times braids the whole nine yards and its still wonderfuk</li>
    <li> Her hair is tangled, matted and shedding right out of the box. It is not afro textured at all. I hope I have something to practice on since I can&#x27;t get past the pre-existing damage of her hair.</li>
    <li> Love this,it was exactly like they described...Thank you</li>
    <li> OMG!, I wanted to practice on my braiding, so at 1st i got the beyonce manikin then when i got it i was like this is pretty nice but its not realistic for the majority of people who braid their hair..so i returned immediately &amp; got NAOMI Afro. I received it shortly and Oh My God!, i felt her hair and the richness and i was inlove (^_^).  The hair is much like a sister that takes care of her hair. It tangles at the end but in a good way cuz that is very realistic. The length is perfect and boy i dont know what else to say. It does have a gray hair here n there but thats how most manikins R .  So all in all, i&#x27;m almost satisfied..i say almost cuz i am reviewing this just today as i have received it.  I havn&#x27;t had it more than 2 hours to say that it will be good forever. But for this moment i like it.  If u want to learn how to braid, i so far would recommend it. :-)</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and it worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Hair is kinky.. just like I needed. Very well made.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter loves it. She uses it to practice braiding and I would recommend it for anyone looking for it for the practice.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and I am loving it. My daughter will be getting one soon.</li>
    <li> So I will be real honest about this doll. First of all I&#x27;m shocked that no one mentioned the fact that we cannot zoom In on the mannequin. Hmmm makes you wonder, well maybe because consumers request for a more natural afro hair texture but instead the mannequin has Indian hair. Lol yes Amazon we are observant and notice the manipulation in mannequin to give the impression of nappy hair when in fact its Indian, Spanish hair like texture;but nevertheless what are we asking for? We are simply requesting for hair that we can practice braiding and I must admit, this hair does just that. I must add when received the doll, I was ecstatic, my mannequin appeared to have been through a whole lot, as if dumped in the dumpster while it was rotating all in attempt to make this Indian texture hair nappy. Rather comical but ide prefer more of Afro black texture but oh well. Lets be real, how many Afro-American willing to donate hair for a doll? I know I&#x27;m not willing to; with all jokes aside, I have not experience any shedding. This is still a doll type material and not a human head, yes its human hair, I would still not encourage much manipulation i.e pulling, yanking, as if she&#x27;s human. Other than Amazon playing zoom in and two different dolls being displayed above type of  games, its all good. You want nappy? find an actual human being I guess. Seems like this is as close as we&#x27;ll ever get, for now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this manikin a few months ago.  I was very excited when I first opened the box.  I proceeded to practice a cornrow style and it came out rather nicely.  Once I wet the hair however, I noticed it was NO longer \\&quot;afro textured\\&quot; but rather flat semi-wavy.  It does shed a lot but it is ok to practice on... I would have given it 5 stars if it was actually afro hair or at least a first cousin of afro hair!  Buyer beware</li>
    <li> She does not have afro hair. It&#x27;s loose curls not the real deal. I am not happy about my purchase. I baught her to learn how to do afro American hair. I have an afro so I know the difference.  Not pleased but will keep the doll since I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m using this to practice my braid patterns for sew ins and its amazing.  I love the texture.  It doesn&#x27;t really feel like African American hair but close enough.  It does shed when you come it out but it mimics what real hair would do anyways so I don&#x27;t mind it.  I love it.  I would recommend it for practicing.  You can place it on a mannequin stand just fine.  I would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;black people &amp;#34; hair, but I kinda figured it wouldnt be so it met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought this afro manikin head because I need a kinky texture to do certain braids styles and natural style.&lt;br /&gt;This hair is not kinky enough to do this.  It is very soft not giving the hold that is needed and was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Misleading if you have the same kind of need I did.  It did not even look like this picture when I received mine.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed and misleading!</li>
    <li> I have purchased the whitney and the daisy mannequin heads on here and Naomi is by far the best! The hair does not look like the picture provided, but it is curly and soft....I straightened some of the hair them washed and conditioned it, and it curled back up...I like this head...the hair is still textured enough that if you want to braid you can...</li>
    <li> The product was ok, don&#x27;t expect it to be useful for very long since the hair on the head comes out very easily. Only had it for a couple of days and I am disappointed at how much hair has come out already. For the price I would expect something well made.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. This was actually a birthday gift for my daughter. The doll I received DID NOT have afro textured hair. The picture and description are very misleading. The doll in the picture appears to have AFRO TEXTURED hair, and the doll I received does not.</li>
    <li> This item came the quickest.  It is just as described.  I&#x27;m going to learn how to braiding hair and needed this hair type manikin. Its perfect!</li>
    <li> She is ok the one I got in my cosmetology kit was better</li>
    <li> Love it.  As you can see from the pic im playing in it. Her hair is coming out but its because her hair is curly. Her hair was very soft. Love her look</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m inexperienced with doing hair, so this was a great head to start with. The hair is super curly and not very wiry but coarse enough to feel like the real thing. I&#x27;ve washed it and braided it and styled it and have had a good time learning new hairstyles with it.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for this as she is learning to do hair.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally get a real manakin head, that had the right texture hair similar to mine own, to be able to style and show off to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I just love my manikin head. The hair is great to work with. It even has realistic grey hairs randomly all thru it. After the initial brush out, hardly any more hair comes out. I got Naomi because i had to learn to do cornrows before my boyfriend would let me do his hair. Just keep practicing until you get it and then you&#x27;ll be able to move on to more complex designs. I would definetly recommend getting Naomi to practice on. And definetly get the holder to secure her on. It&#x27;s a must.</li>
    <li> this manikin&#x27;s hair is a silky curl.  this is far from the african american afro kinky hair i anticipated.  the hair also sheds badly.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product I thought it would be coarse African American hair so that I could teach myself to braid.  This hair is a little too soft for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item awhile back and I love it. I use it for practing ideals on it before I do my own hair. I did receive the item ontime. Money transaction was not a problem. The only thing is I would recommend if you are going to purchase this doll or any doll head make sure you also get the stand. It is really hard to do the dolls hair without the stand to hold the head upright while you do the hair it&#x27;s less stressfull for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay manikin. But it&#x27;s not Afro hair at all. I wanted this manikin so I could learn Afro hair so I can do braids on my brothers and sisters. It did help me but not what I was looking for. Now my sister uses it(she&#x27;s 5) and she loves it. I would of given more starts but it&#x27;s not Afro hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this styling head for my 9 year old to practice doing hair.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it. This is the first thing she grabs in the morning and one&lt;br /&gt;of the last things she sees at night.  The hair texture is good and we&lt;br /&gt;love her skin tone. My only suggestion is that a studier base is needed.</li>
    <li> I love this mannequin</li>
    <li> I was expecting 4a,4b curl pattern . instead after washing and using Loreal power moisture conditioner. this item is easily 2B,2C hair type. this purchase for practice roller sets on kinky natural afro textured hair. give it 1 star bc the details are inacurate and way off.  aside from that its soft wavy hair and easily detangle during the Loreal power moisture conditioner application. its nice and approperiate for those looking for 2B,2C hair type. I will keep it and make use of it.</li>
    <li> I am so sorry to have to rate this one star but this mannequin is sold on the premise that the hair is actual African textured hair, but it isn&#x27;t at all. I bought this so that I could practice certain AA hairstyles like braid outs, twist outs, and shingling, all of which require African textured hair. But after you wet this mannequin&#x27;s hair wet, it is curly and no longer is at all kinky. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is my second doll i&#x27;ve purchased.  The first one had fine hair and my daughter learned to curl, wash, cut.  She then wanted to learn to braid.  She has not seen it yet as it is for christmas, but i&#x27;m sure she will love it.  The hair is not \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; as some people may think.  It is a nice tectured thicker hair.  Hair that is easy to catch and braid. Girls or Moms can learn to do their little girls hair by putting barrettes and rubber bands in it without it falling out or the hair being too thin to hold it.</li>
    <li> Purchased to learn how to braid my daughter&#x27;s hair. The hair on this manikin is very natural and soft.</li>
    <li> Got this for my little sisters and they love it. I&#x27;m going to get one for my self as well</li>
