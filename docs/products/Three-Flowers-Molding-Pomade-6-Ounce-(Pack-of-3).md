      <li>So if your looking for a product this is a good start.</li>
      <li>It has a good smell.</li>
      <li>so it reminds me of my uncles, good price</li>
      <li>tres flores doesn&#x27;t want kids to have good hair.</li>
      <li>It is the best water soluble pomade for me I have tried Suavecito, Steadfast, etc.</li>
      <li>axe, go with Suavecito its good.</li>
      <li>this product is good.</li>
      <li>the smell is pleasant, a floral kind of scent, just like &amp;quot;unscented&amp;quot; hand lotions.</li>
      <li>I am impressed with the fact that he can style his hair and it stays in place without the greasy residue of most pomades, plus it&#x27;s easy to wash out</li>
      <li>I tried this stuff out and it is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Great light hold water-based pomade.</li>
      <li>Best alternative to real grease that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say its medium to med/strong in hold and has a nice shine....</li>
      <li>Awesome that it is water-based and still has such a great hold and appearance.</li>
      <li>Awesome hold, decent sheen, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>Good Smell  Washes out easy  </li>
      <li>and it holds good, better than the grease.also washes off with water easy.</li>
      <li>and it is great and consistent.</li>
      <li>I love it and always order it</li>
      <li>Once i finish this jar of TF, I&#x27;m going to test the volume of the jar to make sure TF isn&#x27;t lying.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as good as layrite but is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I would have given it five stars if it also gave the user a greater ability to shape hair.</li>
      <li>I love Tres Flores Brilliantine and have been using it for years to give my pompadour that awesome shine that only Tres Flores can give.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for control and a healthy sophisticated shine look else where.     </li>
      <li>but it is definitely great for how much you are paying for it</li>
      <li>On top of that, the jar doesn&#x27;t have an indicator on the hold strength</li>
      <li>price could be better</li>
      <li>/&gt;TF sure didn&#x27;t lie when they said it&#x27;s greaseless.</li>
      <li>i love how i can do my hair any style i want .</li>
      <li>Great classic smell, I&#x27;m Mexicano</li>
      <li>, but it washes off easily couldnt be more happier with the product</li>
      <li>My son was looking for a water based pomade for his hair and this is a good product at a reasonable price for the three pack.</li>
      <li>This pomade works great, the key for me is to apply it once my hair is 100% dry, but that seems to work best for most water based pomades.</li>
      <li>right out with water, nice &amp;amp;</li>
      <li>Not too strong but noticable.</li>
      <li>This was the best product and value that I have ever used, hands down.  </li>
      <li>Washes out fine, but won&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>It is light, non-greasy, smells great, and controls my Asian fro.  </li>
      <li>This may be the pomade for you if you have straight hair, otherwise go with uppercut deluxe</li>
      <li>And will buy again, but if your not as cheap as I am and don&#x27;t mind smelling like a D-bag,</li>
      <li>Holds my hair equal to any of the petroleum based pomades, but washes out very nicely.</li>
      <li>pomade has a pleasant scent, washes out with water, and has a decent hold.&lt;br /&gt;The hold is not as strong as Bona Fide, but it certainly gets the pomp up.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the dry look with very light hold this is a good pomade.</li>
      <li>So then I moved onto petrolatum-based pomades, which are the classic kind used by men in the 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I was so excited when Tres Flores came out with a pomade.</li>
      <li>I usually combine it with Alberto VO5 for Gray Hairs or with Brilliantine to get the best result for me.</li>
      <li>The hold is not the best if you&#x27;re going for a traditional pomp look, but if you wear your hair more casually, this is great.</li>
      <li>The only plus about this pomade is that it smells great and it washes out or your hair really well.</li>
      <li>This product works great for me, I have thick hair and it easily puts it in it&#x27;s place.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, just make sure that you close it because it will dry out if you leave it open.</li>
      <li>Combing it through is pretty easy, styling it into a slickback about as much.</li>
      <li>the shine regular pomade does, but other than the shine this is an awesome product.</li>
      <li>I love this product for the original smell I remember but definitely happier with the water based product I will be buying again</li>
      <li>I also live that it&#x27;s water based, so it washes out very easily with a quick shampoo or even just some water...and the scent is old school barber shop!  </li>
      <li>i have wavey hair and it straightens it right out</li>
      <li>Keeps your hair in place all day, not greasy, and washes right out.</li>
      <li>This product is inexpensive, comes in a 6 oz jar (as opposed to other brands, which come in 2 or 3 oz jars), and has great hold, moderate shine (not as good as petrolatum), and has a classic masculine smell, a lot like Vitalis Hair Tonic.</li>
      <li>Light / medium hold in my fine, German hair.</li>
      <li>I love the others such as Layrite and Suavecito, but this one takes it for me.</li>
      <li>I would have given it five stars if it also gave the user a greater ability to shape hair.uld physically find.</li>
      <li>I am able to re-comb my hair multiple times throughout the day without that pomade flaking or losing hold.</li>
      <li>Those who use pomades for higher hair styles, like pomadours, might consider staying with their petrolatum and wax</li>
      <li>It seems best applied in dry hair, although it makes combing a little tougher.&lt;br</li>
      <li>overall, this is an excellent product for the price, and far exceeds any other water-based pomade I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>Pretty much three of these jars for the price of one of the salon brands</li>
      <li>Molding pomade is easy to wash off and provides enough of a hold to do whatever you like with your hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use quite a few pomades, from petroleum based classics like Murrays to new water based legends like Lay-rite, and I have to say - I keep going back to tres flores. It&#x27;s cost to value ratio is second to none. Mind you, my hair style is rather simple: high fade with a side part and contour back. I have Not attempted a huge pompadour with this stuff, and I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work for the psychobilly crowd, but for less extravagant classic men&#x27;s styles: this is the stuff. Great classic smell, I&#x27;m Mexicano so it reminds me of my uncles, good price and it works. No flakes, stays in. Period</li>
    <li> Love this product, I&#x27;m a fan of the oil based one but its hard to take off, the water base works well for people with thin hair like me and its easy to come off.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this stuff and I love it because usually his hair is so crispy with other brands that I can&#x27;t stand touching his hair.  Now, I can run my fingers through his hair and he can have the hair style he likes.  It&#x27;s a win-win!!</li>
    <li> Best price/quality option for my needs. It&#x27;s water-base, so it dries to non-greasy state.</li>
    <li> This pomade works great, the key for me is to apply it once my hair is 100% dry, but that seems to work best for most water based pomades. I have thick curly hair and this straightens it out into a nice neat pomp. I have used Layrite, Hold Fast, La Bella, Suavecito, and Monkey Brains. My favorite is actually Layrite, but Three Flowers isn&#x27;t far behind. Actually, that is strictly because of Layrites smooth vanilla smell... but other than that it isn&#x27;t 3 times better than Three Flowers for 3x the price. This stuff does everything I need it to do and doesn&#x27;t give me any grief. I didn&#x27;t run into the other reviewers problem of having this get all dry looking and frizzy. It just works.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like Tres Flores products, my barbers used it on me when I was 10 or 11 years old. But this Pomade is a little different than Tres Flores Brilliantine because it will dry our hair. I usually combine it with Alberto VO5 for Gray Hairs or with Brilliantine to get the best result for me. One good thing about this Pomade though, it might last me a long time - I got a 3 pack of it.</li>
    <li> this product is good. it almost has the same smell as the tres Flores grease. it kinda gives a gel type of look when applied. and it holds good, better than the grease.also washes off with water easy.</li>
    <li> smells great out of the jar. leaks to my face after few hrs into application...makes my face oily. doesn&#x27;t hold hair for tool long. bleh product</li>
    <li> if ur a &#x27;&#x27; baller on a budget&#x27;&#x27; tres flores is great for rockabilly pompadours&lt;br /&gt;becarefull of heat tends to go flat</li>
    <li> I use Suavecito and Layrite and this product pales in comparison. Sorry I bought 3 pack. Washes out fine, but won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I feel that I have to justify my awarding Three Flowers Molding Pomade four stars instead of five. Five stars, to me, means excellent with no room for improvement. Very few hair products probably achieve five stars of quality. I use Three Flowers for a slick side part hair style reminiscent of the 1930&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s. I first began styling my hair this way with the American Crew kind of water-based pomade, which are incredibly expensive and come in a tiny jar. In other words, a total rip-off. DO NOT waste your money on these kinds of pomades. So then I moved onto petrolatum-based pomades, which are the classic kind used by men in the 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s. Murray&#x27;s Hair Glo is an example of these kinds. Petrolatum is basically petroleum jelly. It provides excellent shine, medium hold, and the ability to re-comb. It stays wet all day and gives the hair a high shine. The only drawback is that... well you&#x27;re putting petroleum jelly in your hair. Ask your girlfriend how she feels about that, you Gene Kelly look-alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried almost every hair product for a side part. If Murray&#x27;s Hair Glo is one of the best for petrolatum pomades, then Three Flowers Molding Pomade is one of the best for water-based pomades. This product is inexpensive, comes in a 6 oz jar (as opposed to other brands, which come in 2 or 3 oz jars), and has great hold, moderate shine (not as good as petrolatum), and has a classic masculine smell, a lot like Vitalis Hair Tonic. It seems best applied in dry hair, although it makes combing a little tougher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks, at least for how I use it, is that it&#x27;s harder to shape hair with this product than with petrolatum products. Those who use pomades for higher hair styles, like pomadours, might consider staying with their petrolatum and wax products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, this is an excellent product for the price, and far exceeds any other water-based pomade I&#x27;ve ever tried. And I&#x27;ve tried all the ones I could physically find. Quality plus cost value, that&#x27;s something hard to find these days. I would have given it five stars if it also gave the user a greater ability to shape hair.uld physically find. Quality plus cost value, that&#x27;s something hard to find these days.

    <li> I missed the traditional barber scent I used growing up.</li>
    <li> I love Tres Flores Brilliantine and have been using it for years to give my pompadour that awesome shine that only Tres Flores can give. That&#x27;s why I was so excited when Tres Flores came out with a pomade. Boy was I disappointed overall.     The only plus about this pomade is that it smells great and it washes out or your hair really well. The only problem is that it is way too water soluble. If you apply it to wet or even damp hair it will turn to liquid and comb right out. So after having failed to work it into my hair after a shower. I tried it on dry hair. It made my hair look dry and frizzy and it had hardly any hold at all.It was extremely hard to style and I found myself re combing my hair way too often.     If you&#x27;re looking for the dry look with very light hold this is a good pomade. But if you&#x27;re looking for control and a healthy sophisticated shine look else where.     Good Smell  Washes out easy  Only works on dry hair  Gives hair a Dry look  Little to no control</li>
    <li> i love how i can do my hair any style i want ., just like a petroleum based pomade., but it washes off easily couldnt be more happier with the product</li>
    <li> Economical but great product!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a BEST BUY!!</li>
    <li> Used this product for about 2 years. It has a good smell. The hold is not as strong as other pomades. My problem is my hair is naturally wavey and I would struggle to keep the shape I wanted. This may be the pomade for you if you have straight hair, otherwise go with uppercut deluxe</li>
    <li> Molding pomade is easy to wash off and provides enough of a hold to do whatever you like with your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been on a search for hair product for months.  I tried this stuff out and it is amazing.  I use a pea sized amount for a thick set of hair.  I am in my 20&#x27;s and have pretty long hair for a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product 2 weeks back. I have curly hair and i always slick it back. Ive used other water-based products but my favorite was La Bella. After hearing that they went out of business, I needed something new. I&#x27;ve tried other products and was not satisfied. This product is awesome for me. I hate that greasy feeling from other products. I love the others such as Layrite and Suavecito, but this one takes it for me. It has that classic Tres Flores smell. Not too strong but noticable. It washes out with just water. Not to mention the price is incredible! Less than $1 an OZ. I also tried the Pomade AXE came out with but its not worth $7 for only 2.5oz. If your not worried about price, Layrite is great. But these days im on a budget. Im stuck on this product. Im gonna have to stock up.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the cost. I try Suavecito Pomade and it was good but I did not like the smell at all. Three Flowers Molding Pomade, I found that it started off great but by the end of the day the hold was lessen, if one piece of your hair moved it was hard to get it back in place. With that said I would still recommend this product, for the cost compare to any other pomade and I can deal with working with the hair to get it back in place. And will buy again, but if your not as cheap as I am and don&#x27;t mind smelling like a D-bag, axe, go with Suavecito its good.</li>
    <li> Keeps your hair in place all day, not greasy, and washes right out. I love it and always order it</li>
    <li> Not the best pomade I&#x27;ve used but it is definitely great for how much you are paying for it</li>
    <li> I turned to this after getting tired of spending so much on Matrix and Redken Water Wax. It is a little less dense than the other two but works just as well. It took a couple days to figure out the perfect hair wetness/amount but not a problem. I am so happy to have found this. Pretty much three of these jars for the price of one of the salon brands and it works great. Also goes a long way like the salon brands. I opened the first jar a couple months ago and it is still about half full. Great value.</li>
    <li> Awesome water based pomade for the price. Light / medium hold in my fine, German hair. Does harden in the hair a bit but not overwhelmingly so. Recombable with a wet comb. Classic scent. I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re a gentlemen with an old school haircut, this product is a must.</li>
    <li> For the price, I can&#x27;t complain. The hold is not the best if you&#x27;re going for a traditional pomp look, but if you wear your hair more casually, this is great. If you don&#x27;t need the strongest hold, $14 for a 3 pack on amazon makes tres flores molding pomade a must have in the arsenal. Even if you primarily use something like layrite or a brand with a better hold, you may wanna keep this handy for the second dips to smooth out stray hairs - helps the expensive stuff last longer.</li>
    <li> I use Layrite then I use the three flowers for the smell. Oh Yeah!!! So if your looking for a product this is a good start. Also forgot not good when it&#x27;s raining outside loses it&#x27;s hold..</li>
    <li> Its worth the price compared to other water based pomades; especially since its a 3 pack. prompt delivery came within the week i</li>
    <li> This is a great product, just make sure that you close it because it will dry out if you leave it open. Great price for what you get and one of my favorites. BEWARE that the smell is a little strong and flowery.</li>
    <li> Excellent water based pomade.&lt;br /&gt;My go to pomade is Bona Fide pomade with is roughly three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;This pomade has a pleasant scent, washes out with water, and has a decent hold.&lt;br /&gt;The hold is not as strong as Bona Fide, but it certainly gets the pomp up.&lt;br /&gt;The price on this pomade is just too good to pass up for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try this, I will always keep it stocked.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for a while now and it is great and consistent. Not as good as layrite but is well worth the price. I gave 4 stars because one of the caps was cracked and a tiny bit spilled out. Not a big deal because I had an extra cap.</li>
    <li> great product, washes outta the hair without any residue. great price here on amazon. i have wavey hair and it straightens it right out</li>
    <li> Great product works just as well as layrite and suavecito, just the smell is not as pleasant as layrite or suavecito, hence the 4 stars</li>
    <li> This is awesome pomade and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat in my opinion!  I use it a lot, almost daily...I&#x27;d say its medium to med/strong in hold and has a nice shine....I also live that it&#x27;s water based, so it washes out very easily with a quick shampoo or even just some water...and the scent is old school barber shop!  I will always have some of this on the counter!</li>
    <li> Best priced water based pomade I can find that&#x27;s still on to put on your hair. Slight variation to the original scent but washes off easily and completely with shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great light hold water-based pomade.</li>
    <li> My son was looking for a water based pomade for his hair and this is a good product at a reasonable price for the three pack. I am impressed with the fact that he can style his hair and it stays in place without the greasy residue of most pomades, plus it&#x27;s easy to wash out so that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> Awesome hold, decent sheen, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! It is the best water soluble pomade for me I have tried Suavecito, Steadfast, etc. And this one hols the best for me And it is much cheaper than the rest of them I highly recommend this if you are on a tight budget</li>
    <li> Super thick, coarse, very straight hair is what I have on my head.  I promise you that my hair never lays down unless it is three inches in length and at that point it isn&#x27;t laying down, it slightly leans to the left due to my cowlick.  If there was such a style as an Asian fro, I would be the poster-boy.  Now that those few points are out of the way, I would like to let you all know how much I like Three Flowers Molding Pomade.  This stuff, after three single finger scoops that are about the size of a small marble, really works well for my hair.  It is light, non-greasy, smells great, and controls my Asian fro.  I currently have a slight undercut that I comb-over.  I try to give the front a little lift, but nothing too voluminous.  I can get a crazy pomp or some wild spikes if I please, but work would fire me.  I am able to re-comb my hair multiple times throughout the day without that pomade flaking or losing hold. This stuff holds great and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  The other pomades out there are too expensive for the amount that I use daily.  Three Flowers Molding Pomade is economical and effective at keeping my thick year styled the way I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.  I think you will like it.</li>
    <li> This product works great for me, I have thick hair and it easily puts it in it&#x27;s place. I would definitely buy again and recommend this to people</li>
    <li> I love this product for the original smell I remember but definitely happier with the water based product I will be buying again</li>
    <li> This was the best product and value that I have ever used, hands down.  Awesome that it is water-based and still has such a great hold and appearance.</li>
    <li> price could be better but I like it and u don&#x27;t need much</li>
    <li> SUBJECT:&lt;br /&gt;Chinese, 24YO, straight, thick, hard to manage hair. I slick my hair back with a tiny bump up front. A full-size pompadour isn&#x27;t conservative enough for the jobsite. unfortunately, water-based pomades are either super expensive like layrite or non-existent in my area like monkey brains. thankfully, there&#x27;s always another solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE:&lt;br /&gt;I got the 6-pack on Amazon for maybe $31-32. At almost $1/oz this is a steal for a water-based pomade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING &amp;amp; PRESENTATION:&lt;br /&gt;simple-looking container with a green lid.  I chuckled at the &amp;quot;KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN&amp;quot; warning. either your kids will think this is food or tres flores doesn&#x27;t want kids to have good hair. the container is see-through, and the pomade itself is the same color as the picture - a darkish oil yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still scratching my head about the amount of product in the jar. It says it&#x27;s 6oz, but it&#x27;s not that much bigger than a 3oz tin of Murray&#x27;s. Once i finish this jar of TF, I&#x27;m going to test the volume of the jar to make sure TF isn&#x27;t lying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE &amp;amp; APPEARANCE:&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is medium, maybe a tad bit lighter than Monkey Brains pomade - this is not a heavy pomade. It has a medium-hold, maybe a little bit lighter than Monkey brains. Combing it through is pretty easy, styling it into a slickback about as much. the smell is pleasant, a floral kind of scent, just like &amp;quot;unscented&amp;quot; hand lotions. Thankfully, the scent doesn&#x27;t sting your throat like the way Monkey Brains does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TF sure didn&#x27;t lie when they said it&#x27;s greaseless. There is almost no sheen to this product. I use Murray&#x27;s super-light pomade as an &amp;quot;equalizer&amp;quot; to add shine and lift, but even using super-light as a top-coat doesn&#x27;t give much if any sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WASHABILITY:&lt;br /&gt;rinses right out with water, nice &amp;amp; easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER:&lt;br /&gt;looks are deceiving! this little jar IS actually 6oz, because with other water-soluble pomades i go through about 1oz/week. When it&#x27;s not much bigger than a tin of murray&#x27;s, it makes you wonder.  On top of that, the jar doesn&#x27;t have an indicator on the hold strength (this review should dispel that). at the end of a long, hot sweaty day, it&#x27;ll kinda stink in your hair, hence the 4-star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;this isn&#x27;t a bad pomade for slickbacks and folks on a budget. but if you&#x27;re the type that must have a HUGE pompadour with LOTS of sheen, you&#x27;ll be thoroughly disappointed. will revisit this review to update as necessary.</li>
    <li> I just recently started growing my hair out (after close to two decades of having a shaved head) When I did have hair I did use the regular Three Flowers pomade but I disliked the fact it would leave a greasy stain on my pillows, even after taking a warm shower. Forward 20 years and I wanted to try Three Flowers again, I was happy to see they had a product which was water based but still had the great molding and smell to it. The only draw back it doesn&#x27;t give your hair the shine regular pomade does, but other than the shine this is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> works perfect for all day hold, easy to redo with just water and comb</li>
    <li> This is excellent stuff! I apply to damp towel-dried hair, and it gives very good hold and shine. Holds my hair equal to any of the petroleum based pomades, but washes out very nicely. Lasts all day and smells great! Best alternative to real grease that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
