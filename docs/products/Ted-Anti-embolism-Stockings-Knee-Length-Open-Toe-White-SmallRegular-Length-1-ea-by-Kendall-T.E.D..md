      <li>so feel that its safe to assume they got the job done.</li>

      <li>I am looking for something with more compression and that last longer.</li>
      <li>2 more pairs at a later date.</li>
      <li>They were relatively comfortable and she ultimately didn&#x27;t develop any blood clots</li>
      <li>They fit well and hold up when machine washed multiple times.</li>
      <li>The stockings really help with that problem.  </li>
      <li>They really do help the swelling in my lower legs, ankles and feet.  </li>
      <li>This is the only site I could find with the small size and they were a good price and mailed out quickly.</li>
      <li>when I&#x27;m older, so I got the trusted TED hose that I have spent many days squeezing my pt&#x27;s legs into.</li>
      <li>I will certainly try Amazon again for future purchases first!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a new nurse.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re exactly like the ones my OB put on me during a brief hospital stay.</li>
      <li>Glad to find these socks in a small size.</li>
      <li>I got these much cheaper than buying them locally!</li>
      <li>These are the exact same brand as what I left the hospital with after a pulmonary embolism.</li>
      <li>The Covidien small/ reg fits more like an extra small.</li>
      <li>These stockings are for a thin person; fit very well; have a &amp;#</li>
      <li>The stockings are exactly the same as I get on medical web sites, same sizing, etc.</li>
      <li>They are as comfortable as can be expected and gave a little bit of peace of mind after going home.</li>

<li> I cannot recommend them at this time as they did not last as long as those given to me by my rehab facility.</li>
<li> However, I still prefer open toe to closed toe.</li>

<li> I found them extremely satisfactory.</li>
<li> But, after a few wearings (maybe they stretched) and washings, they don&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
<li> I needed it for a small surgery -- and it wasn&#x27;t so tight that I could barely get them on.  </li>

<li> These are easier to work with, but a little heavy for summer.</li>
<li> Compression is alright, but by the end of the day my legs are itchy, not sure if its the fabric itself, or how they&#x27;ve put the fabric together...</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the stockings got a small rip after wearing them only twice.</li>

<li> Also, the open toe thing doesn&#x27;t make any sense, as it covers your toes, but provides an awkward opening.</li>
<li> but much less expensive.  </li>
<li> Once the package is open, you can&#x27;t return it:(</li>
<li> I&#x27;m thin, but by the end of the night I can see and feel the swelling in my calves.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too thin.  </li>
<li> Zippers are uncomfortable.</li>
<li> The sizing is wrong too.  </li>
<li> We did have to return one pair because we ordered a wrong size.  </li>
<li> And the worst thing is - white stockings get dirty immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I work at night I am on my feet 5 out of 8 hours and the ted stockings provide good support.</li>
    <li> My legs swell very badly, due to heat failure and only having one kidney.  The stockings really help with that problem.  Could not find them locally.</li>
    <li> Good quality stockings.  Good price!!  I got these much cheaper than buying them locally!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my fiance during her pregnancy because swelling and she loved them!</li>
    <li> Once you get the right size, they do work, do not bunch, and provide relief. It might take some trial and error to find the right size, but once you do find it, these are a very good product that certainly beat the dangers and complications of surgery.</li>
    <li> These work great and were the cheapest I found. I&#x27;m 8 mos pregnant and it keeps the swelling to a minimum. True to size, delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Glad to find these socks in a small size. Just what I needed following my hip replacement. Good quality....</li>
    <li> If you are looking for smaller-sized compression stockings, here you are.  This is the only site I could find with the small size and they were a good price and mailed out quickly.</li>
    <li> Love them. Great material for all temperatures and climates and antibacterial  odor control. Very supportive for hours and stays in place from the moment you put them on until you take them off. Have many pairs and will order more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new nurse. I&#x27;ve never had problems with my calves swelling until I started doing 12H shifts. I&#x27;m thin, but by the end of the night I can see and feel the swelling in my calves. I do NOT want spider veins, or risk arteriole or veinous insufficiency when I&#x27;m older, so I got the trusted TED hose that I have spent many days squeezing my pt&#x27;s legs into. Well, at first they felt OK, better. But, after a few wearings (maybe they stretched) and washings, they don&#x27;t seem to work as well. I hand wash and line dry them. I guess this isn&#x27;t the brand for me. I am looking for something with more compression and that last longer. Suggestions?</li>
    <li> These are absolutely fabulous! I sit quite a bit during my commute to/from work and throughout the day. I tried these to see if they would make a difference, and boy did they!! Love them!!</li>
    <li> These great price for value!  My legs are looking better already! Hopefully, no surgery or laser intervention will be needed.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my wife while she was on bedrest.  They were relatively comfortable and she ultimately didn&#x27;t develop any blood clots so feel that its safe to assume they got the job done.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy!  The stockings are exactly the same as I get on medical web sites, same sizing, etc. but much less expensive.  I will certainly try Amazon again for future purchases first!</li>
    <li> In third trimester I had an issue with circulation/fainting. These socks helped keep the blood flow returning to my heart. I mostly used them at night because I&#x27;d wake up out of breath from lack of circulation. During the daytime you have to wear tall boots or pants to conceal them. They&#x27;re exactly like the ones my OB put on me during a brief hospital stay. The only drawback is that after a few wears and washes they start to stretch out a bit.</li>
    <li> These are the exact same brand as what I left the hospital with after a pulmonary embolism. I didn&#x27;t have the same difficulty getting them on as others have mentioned (they just take practice). They are as comfortable as can be expected and gave a little bit of peace of mind after going home. The price here on Amazon was 1/3 of the price I found in local stores, so I did order 2 more pairs at a later date. I washed these in a netted garment bag on gentle in cold water and laid flat to dry (as recommended), and I did not have any runs or loss of support. The open toe takes a bit to get used to as it can make a lump under your toes if not straightened out. However, I still prefer open toe to closed toe.</li>
    <li> Stocking sold as advertised. They really do help the swelling in my lower legs, ankles and feet.  They fit  great, really fast shipment. Product is as as advertised.</li>
    <li> Zippers are uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> It provides the best support for my dad&#x27;s feet. He has varicose veins, and the price is just right. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> They fit well and hold up when machine washed multiple times.</li>
    <li> It arrived when I was told it would. That is all that i feel like I want to say today.</li>
    <li> Quality is no longer as it used to be , thinner</li>
    <li> Buyers beware as the quality is unlike the ones from Kendall brand. The item received is from a different company called Covidien and was informed by Prime Medical Store that Covidien brought Kendall Healthcare. If so, the sizing of the product shouldn&#x27;t have changed. The Covidien small/ reg fits more like an extra small. The quality of the material is not as superior as it was from Kendall brand. Once the package is open, you can&#x27;t return it:(</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the stockings got a small rip after wearing them only twice. I cannot recommend them at this time as they did not last as long as those given to me by my rehab facility.</li>
    <li> Was expecting the opening for toes to be on the top--not real comfortable with the opening on the bottom of the foot.</li>
    <li> I was prescribed to wear them because of my low blood pressure during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stockings do a good job I guess, putting pressure on your legs. But! They are rather hard to put on. Also, the open toe thing doesn&#x27;t make any sense, as it covers your toes, but provides an awkward opening. And the worst thing is - white stockings get dirty immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they do work, and the price is very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these style of socks before since I&#x27;m a nurse and I&#x27;m on my feet all the time but I usually use a different brand. This brand is okay, getting smalls I thought they&#x27;d be a bit tighter and I do have a size 5 foot and the foot area is still slightly too big. Compression is alright, but by the end of the day my legs are itchy, not sure if its the fabric itself, or how they&#x27;ve put the fabric together... I will definitely keep wearing them but I think they&#x27;re going to end up stretching out after a while :/</li>
    <li> I love this stockings. It gives enough compression for my calf</li>
    <li> These are easier to work with, but a little heavy for summer.</li>
    <li> I have a pair of TED stockings in nude which have served me well for quite awhile.  They are wearing out so I ordered these.  The material is not the same.  It&#x27;s too thin.  The sizing is wrong too.  It&#x27;s the same size as the nude ones but these are too tight. Also, the swelling in my calves and ankles still exist with these stockings whereas the nude pair don&#x27;t allow my legs to swell at all.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I needed it for a small surgery -- and it wasn&#x27;t so tight that I could barely get them on.  They were comfortable and durable.</li>
    <li> These stockings are for a thin person; fit very well; have a &amp;#34;breathing hole&amp;#34; at the bottom.  I found them extremely satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast.  Quality was great.  We did have to return one pair because we ordered a wrong size.  The return was processed quickly.</li>
    <li> Great fit and comfort. Works as advertised</li>
