### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome product.</li>
      <li>They provide coverage with excellent quality</li>
      <li>I have used Paula Dorf eye primer for years and it is, without a doubt, THE BEST eye primer on the market.....</li>
      <li>Excellent.  </li>
      <li>One of the very best eye primers.</li>
      <li>brought this item after I saw my hairdresser use it to create the perfect palette for eye shadow color and eye liner.  </li>
      <li>Great product; eye liner does not run through or move unlike Laura Geller one I was using.  </li>
      <li>I like it and the service was good.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect for caucasian skin tone and it offers a great coverage.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best eye primer, it goes on smooth, lasts the whole day and is the best value for your money</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find out it doesn&#x27;t have paraben in the ingredients.  </li>
      <li>All her products are outstanding.</li>
      <li>anything darker tends to be more smudgier.  </li>
      <li>This is a repeat purchase because I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Sure I have ventured off to try others, but always return to Paula Dorf.</li>
      <li>What more can I say, it does everything I want a primer to do.</li>
      <li>Seemed to cause my eye makeup to run more than if no primer had been used at all.  </li>
      <li>I love this eye primer.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply with a brush or even your finger.</li>
      <li>Light and efficient.</li>
      <li>It works, it goes on smoothly, it lightens the eye area even when I don&#x27;t use eye shadow over it.  </li>
      <li>What I do notice most of all is that liner doesn&#x27;t bleed out on the bottom lids and stays put until I take it off, in fact the makeup on my eyes stays good until I take it off at night close to 12 hours later.  </li>
      <li>I tend to have smudgy look to my eye makeup because of combination of sweat and teary eyes so anything that makes my eye makeup look crisp is better.  </li>
      <li>all of the eye make up by Paula Dorf are superior to many other companies.</li>
      <li>, simply because it&#x27;s that good.</li>
      <li>Eye make up fresh all day.</li>
      <li>Good product, but smells a little rancid; like it&#x27;s been on the shelf for a while.  </li>
      <li>I have used pathos Paula Dorf product since it came out, and although I have tried many others, always end going back to it.</li>
      <li>next day, I tried to put some powder on top of the primer to see if it would  hold the eyeshadow and eyeliner in place...</li>
      <li>the color is exactly what you would expect for an eye primer, and it allows you to put your shadow on almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s first ingredient is &#x27;mineral oil&#x27;...</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way for great coverage.</li>
      <li>Highly, highly recommend for all skin types and ages.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price because it goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I would have purchased this from the Paul Dorf site directly, but they were out of stock for quite some time.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>Really lightens up your eye area and helps makeup last all day into the night!</li>
      <li>Absolutely hands down the best eye makeup primer I have ever used...can be used daily by itself as well as a base for all my other eye makeup products.</li>

    <li> Awesome product. A little goes a long way. Keeps eye shadow in place all day and night.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes and this brand does not irritate them.  I like it and the service was good.</li>
    <li> have been using this for ever..getting harder to find,but though the pot looks&lt;br /&gt;small,it lasts me a year,and I use it every day!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eye primer, it goes on smooth, lasts the whole day and is the best value for your money</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0006LUZKI Paula Dorf Eye Primer  , 0.1-Ounce]]I brought this item after I saw my hairdresser use it to create the perfect palette for eye shadow color and eye liner.  I tend to have smudgy look to my eye makeup because of combination of sweat and teary eyes so anything that makes my eye makeup look crisp is better.  I put this on after I have applied foundation to my entire face and then put on my eye makeup which includes liner and eyeshadow.  I create a version of the smokey eye look using purple and pink colors anything darker tends to be more smudgier.  What I do notice most of all is that liner doesn&#x27;t bleed out on the bottom lids and stays put until I take it off, in fact the makeup on my eyes stays good until I take it off at night close to 12 hours later.  I would recommend this product to anyone who can&#x27;t get their eye makeup to stay on properly.</li>
    <li> One of the very best eye primers. Easy to apply with a brush or even your finger. A little goes a long way for great coverage. Eye makeup then goes on smoother and lasts. There is lots of product and it lasts a long time. I have used pathos Paula Dorf product since it came out, and although I have tried many others, always end going back to it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely hands down the best eye makeup primer I have ever used...can be used daily by itself as well as a base for all my other eye makeup products.</li>
    <li> This is probably the worst or at least one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever used.  I wanted to give it 0 stars, but that wasn&#x27;t one of the options.  This is supposed to be a primer?! It&#x27;s first ingredient is &#x27;mineral oil&#x27;...it&#x27;s slick, slimy, and my eye-makeup lasted about 2 hours max.&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I tried to put some powder on top of the primer to see if it would  hold the eyeshadow and eyeliner in place...even with the powder,  I looked like a &#x27;raccoon&#x27; after about 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used paula dorf  products before and been satisfied, but this product is AWFUL...&lt;br /&gt;SINCERELY DO NOT RECOMMEND IT...</li>
    <li> I love this eye primer. Unfortunately, it is hard to find and Amazon is the only place. The color is perfect for caucasian skin tone and it offers a great coverage. Light and efficient. I have lots of veins on my eyelids and this product hides it all!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years after have a makeover at Bendel&#x27;s in NYC which sells Paula Dorf products.  All her products are outstanding.</li>
    <li> I have used Paula Dorf&#x27;s eye primer for several years now.  I have tried other but always come back to this.  It works, it goes on smoothly, it lightens the eye area even when I don&#x27;t use eye shadow over it.  I was pleased to find out it doesn&#x27;t have paraben in the ingredients.  It lasts over six months.  What more can I say, it does everything I want a primer to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a decade., simply because it&#x27;s that good. Sure I have ventured off to try others, but always return to Paula Dorf. It&#x27;s worth the price because it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Will always use. Eye make up fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Have used it for years.  It last a long time &amp; never gets dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps eye make-up on all day &amp; night.</li>
    <li> I like this eye primer and have been metering it out carefully ever since Dillards stopped carrying Paula Dorf and this product has been out of stock on the Paula Dorf website.  However, it is back in stock and I just bought some for $25 so why is it listed for $145 on Amazon?  The low rating is for the crazy price.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase because I LOVE this product.  Use it sparingly - it&#x27;s all you need.  It will not cake, it doesn&#x27;t settle in creases (and I&#x27;m 65 so I have some creases!) the color is exactly what you would expect for an eye primer, and it allows you to put your shadow on almost immediately.  Highly, highly recommend for all skin types and ages.</li>
    <li> I have used Paula Dorf eye primer for years and it is, without a doubt, THE BEST eye primer on the market.....period!  I was so disappointed when Ulta stopped carrying it, but fortunately we have Amazon and eBay.</li>
    <li> Seemed to cause my eye makeup to run more than if no primer had been used at all.  Back to Nars.</li>
    <li> Good product, but smells a little rancid; like it&#x27;s been on the shelf for a while.  I would have purchased this from the Paul Dorf site directly, but they were out of stock for quite some time.</li>
    <li> all of the eye make up by Paula Dorf are superior to many other companies.They provide coverage with excellent quality</li>
    <li> Really lightens up your eye area and helps makeup last all day into the night!</li>
    <li> Great product; eye liner does not run through or move unlike Laura Geller one I was using.  A keeper for me!!</li>
