### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It smells wonderful- not too manly, not too girly, (hubby and I both wear it) and best of all not overpowering.</li>
      <li>5 Excellent Stars!!</li>
      <li>This stuff was incredible!</li>
      <li>; I in my best Takei voice say &amp;#34;Yes</li>
      <li>He is still reviewing all of the proposals to see which one is in his best interest.  </li>
      <li>Best.</li>
      <li>That is, until a friend of mine bought me this wonderful \\&quot;Eau</li>
      <li>My husband and I were in a bit of a drought, so I figured the best way to end the drought would be to spice it up somehow.  </li>
      <li>at a speed of warp factor awesome, baby!</li>
      <li>Truly, I stood amazed – but the awesome power of</li>
      <li>can this make me as awesome as Mister Takei?\\&quot;, I thought, \\&quot;Will</li>
      <li>Best day ever!</li>
      <li>Of course I couldn&#x27;t deny that I was perfect for the job.</li>
      <li>Engage all the hawties just like Sulu with this wonderful fragrance!</li>
      <li>Upon reaching work, one whiff of my musky odeur and my boss immediately promoted me to CEO and God of all that we manufacture, namely nail polish remover pads, but nevertheless, I was awesome in his sight.</li>
      <li>Thank you George Takei for unleashing the primal within me, for now I shall truly be great!</li>
      <li>In that sense, it&#x27;s a wonderful gift.  </li>
      <li>Awesome description!</li>
      <li>Eau My perfectly complements my Wolf Sweatshirt.</li>
      <li>The perfect accessory for my son-in-law.</li>
      <li>However, as I was riding my motorbike at the time, this was perhaps not the best of circumstances to be pursued by masses of crazed people suffering from a pheromone induced psychosis!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Boy, did life get awesome after that.</li>
      <li>It was great!</li>
      <li>I got three phone numbers on Wednesday and two of Friday from perfect strangers.</li>

      <li>It is wonderful and everyone else just needs to get over it.  </li>

      <li>it is a very pleasant smell, I quite like it.</li>
      <li>Amazing!!</li>
      <li>As the shock lifted the fog of sleep from me, the notion that I might have accidentally fallen asleep with my contact lenses still on held no fear and gave way to joy, for I realised I no longer needed them because I could now see with flawless 20:20 vision.</li>
      <li>; THAT&#x27;S A GOOD FRAGRANCE FOR YOU!  </li>
      <li>My friends were astounded by the amount of beautiful women were jostling to get close to me, to bask in my beautiful odour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to George Takei</li>
      <li>I loved the sense of pride, and the sense of wonderful aroma that has come from adding this to my collection!</li>
      <li>It is awesome to see what a good smelling tiger can do for a beef stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>; When we reached our destination, about to get off the elevator, I looked both beautiful women in the eye, bent over, farted and quipped, &amp;#34;Broccoli - 49 cents a pound.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Turn the Vulcan in your life into your very own Captain Kirk with this GORGEOUS fragrance!  </li>
      <li>I can say is that I am very pleased!</li>
      <li>But it is a great smelling calogne and</li>
      <li>But eventually it became too great for them to handle.</li>
      <li>George may have tried to fly the Excelsior apart...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Brian had a great birthday and Eau</li>
      <li>Will look great on the bureau or dresser.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Turns out it smells great</li>
      <li>think either men or women would be happy wearing this cologne.</li>
      <li>ordered food with great antici....</li>
      <li>it is a great fragrance for  all.</li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t get a supply from Harcourt Mudd, Amazon makes a great distributor.</li>

      <li>The ladies and men alike will say \\&quot;Eau myyyyyy, who is this attractive cadet?\\&quot;</li>
      <li>and I can conclude with a shadow of a doubt that it smells like happy and a hint of rainbows.</li>
      <li>Either way its a win win.</li>
      <li>and this smells great on me.  </li>
      <li>It may eventually be the demise of our world, but what a great smelling way to go.</li>
      <li>, DAMN is George Takei quite attractive all of a sudden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great experience.</li>
      <li>Cologne led to some great times but must be used in moderation.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is great, but &amp;#34;Set</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday. I was worried about the scent since I obviously couldn&#x27;t know what it smelled like before hand, but it&#x27;s actually really close to what my boyfriend already uses! It&#x27;s a much better smelling, classier version of Axe Phoenix. Bought it as a novelty gift and ended up getting something he actually wears every day and loves.</li>
    <li> Sprayed a dab of this on me and started bustin through walls hella boss style. Date was super impressed. 5/5 stars</li>
    <li> For only 43 Mana, I received the following from this potion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+5 Stun&lt;br /&gt;+5 Fabulous&lt;br /&gt;+20 Cunning (lingus)&lt;br /&gt;+10 Charm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that I am very pleased! It keeps the Orcs at bay and allows me focus my energy and health on boldly going where no man has gone before. Thank you Takei!</li>
    <li> The Orion girls (green girls from star trek) cannot resist the fragrance of Eau My It is so alluring they have been known to traverse whole galaxy&#x27;s, How they are able to do this is still unknown scientist believe it has something to do with quantum entanglement but this is still speculation as the Orion&#x27;s won&#x27;t reveal their secrets. It&#x27;s amazing and somewhat dangerous they tend to be quite aggressive. One must account for this when applying Eau My. Please use it sparingly for your safety and the rest of the Galaxy&#x27;s safety.</li>
    <li> After donning my red shirt for the upcoming away mission,  I decided almost as an after thought to spritz some of this around my &amp;#34;dilithium crystals&amp;#34;  for good luck. Having already watched 786 of my red shirted comrades join Kirk on these missions without returning last week, I could user almost the luck I could get.  As soon as we landed everything changed.  It went from away party to &amp;#34;awaaay parrtaaay&amp;#34; at a speed of warp factor awesome, baby! Hot blooded,  green skinned chicks were all about this guy&#x27;s space junk! We set our phasors to fabulous and rocked it like it was the final frontier!</li>
    <li> Clean soft and sexy scent.  Not overbearing or pushy.  No so understated that it would be missed.  Just makes me want to stand closer to my husband.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby, love it!</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and wow what a refreshing scent.  As quoted, it&#x27;s a crisp clean fragrance, one that I genuinely like.  I have no idea where George got the idea of making such a nice product but he did his homework on this.  When it comes to colognes, I&#x27;m very discriminating and only go for the finer stuff that really costs.  This stuff is now at the top of my list.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gag gift for a friend of mine, and it was a huge hit. This is a solid gift for those who enjoy the wit and observations of George Takei.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m forced to rate this only three stars due to the fact that after I put it on a bare chested, genetically engineered superhuman attacked my ship, declared that my smell was too superior, and started giving lectures on the proper way to slit a throat.  At least I smelled damn good during the encounter.</li>
    <li> I was trapped on Triskelion, and it looked like I was facing certain death, but one spritz of Eau My and I was able to seduce Shahna. Unfortunately, she remembered Earthlings from some guy she&#x27;d met before and was hesitant to let me go, but I was able to convince her of my sincerity before narrowly escaping. If you can&#x27;t get a supply from Harcourt Mudd, Amazon makes a great distributor.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Every morning, I get out of the shower and liberally spray myself with George&#x27;s Eau My. I usually don&#x27;t even get a smile when I walk past the ladies, but lately, I have been turning heads left and right. I got three phone numbers on Wednesday and two of Friday from perfect strangers. Thank You George.</li>
    <li> Good ol&#x27; uncle George does it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you want to fit in with the Lions Tigers or Bears this is the scent for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the prowl? Attract your prey with ease from the master of all things and try Eau My!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get all the green Slave girls (or boys) you can hhandle Thanks to the alluring scent from Uncle George!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lions, Tigers and Bears Eau My!!!</li>
    <li> This is great!!  I can&#x27;t wait to wear this cologne at the next Pon Farr party at the Vulcan nightclub.</li>
    <li> I put on Eau My before going out, and needless to say, I went from Solo to Sulu in a matter of seconds.</li>
    <li> How do you think I got that way? My man was wearing Eau My and nature took its course...again and again.  Thanks, George! Now, excuse me but I have to go bury my eggs on the beach.</li>
    <li> SULU&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sweating like a bridegroom.&lt;br /&gt;  RILEY&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, me too.&lt;br /&gt; SULU&lt;br /&gt;Eau My!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  SULU&lt;br /&gt;Hey, why don&#x27;t you come down to the gym with me, Kevin, my lad.&lt;br /&gt;  RILEY&lt;br /&gt;Now?&lt;br /&gt;  SULU&lt;br /&gt;Why not? A light work-out will take the edge off.&lt;br /&gt;  RILEY&lt;br /&gt;Eau My!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Eau My will enhance your intergalactic experience even if you find yourself in a Mirror Universe. You wont need a phaser to tame that angry Klingon female who caught your eye at the bar. A single spritz of Eau My will have green women (and men) swooning all over you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you find yourself in the midst of kal-if-fee during your Pon Farr or simply seek a parmaqqay for an evening of love poetry, bruises &amp; broken furniture, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friendly warning...... I can no longer make love to my girlfriend unless she is covered in green body paint &amp; wearing a belly dancers outfit so use at your own risk. If you suddenly find yourself attracted to the opposite sex just roll with it, it&#x27;s no tribble at all.....</li>
    <li> Knowing  &amp;#34; Uncle George&amp;#34; to be a true mans man, I decided to try Eau My. After spritzing on a liberal amount, I proceeded to go out for a rare night on the town. I found this stylish little club which I had never noticed before that I was oddly attracted to when I read the sign out front stating the band for the evening was a tribute band of The Village People. The evening was a great success, as I met many new friends who it turns out I have alot in common with. An evening filled with gay abandon ensued and when I made it home at the crack of dawn, I suddenly had the urge  to pack my bags and leave my marriage of 30 + years. My only complaint is the $39.99 price paid to find this sweet nectar has now ballooned to $786,039.99 ( Half my net worth). But that&#x27;s ok, because my new flame Bruce says he loves me no matter how much I have. Thanks Uncle George, and hug Brad for me....</li>
    <li> After applying  &amp;#34;Eay My&amp;#34; I felt like a  man.... Slightly worrying considering I&#x27;m heterosexual!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wear with caution.... or an open mind!</li>
    <li> Eau MY is a new fragrance by Star Trek legend George Takei. The fragrance is a take on George&#x27;s famous \\&quot;OHHH MYYY!\\&quot;. Another celeb endorsed scent but this gives new meaning to Eau de toilette. In fact it is quite aromatic, nice and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I think \\&quot;EAUX MY\\&quot; would have sounded better. \\&quot;EUAX is perfumery, defined as a solution of spirited fragrant essential oils with or without the addition of other fragrant substances.[19] It can also be distilled waters with the smells of flower.\\&quot; (source wikipedia)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this over other celeb endorsed colognes and perfurmes - namely Rhianna, Gaga, Beiber, Nikki, etc. At least George is REAL...and good to his fans! The only one it cannot top is the now defunct \\&quot;3121\\&quot;. I was sad to see that one go to the wayside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne will not transform you into a Starfleet Commander but pretending is always fun!</li>
    <li> I often wondered how Captain Kirk could always score with the chicks, be they alien or human, on Star Trek. I mean at least one or two could have considered him not their type, no matter how haltingly dramatic his speech was! And it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I discovered the trick to James. T. Kirk&#x27;s inter-species Amour...If you watch closely, just before he goes off to rendezvous with his flavor of the week, he brushes up against SULU! There it was, before my very own eyes...Scent Trek! His secret, it appeared, all along was to take some of Sulu&#x27;s scent with him and no matter who suited his fancy that week he was sure to score! How diabolically deviant of him! So if your goal is to score with any gender of any species, pick yourself up some of that Sulu Scent. You will have your amour saying Eau My what a girl or guy! Haltingly Dramatic Speeches not required, although they do seem to help...Kirk out!</li>
    <li> A man should be strong, powerful, and your noise should know it.  This Eau My is not that scent. But what it lacks in power, it makes up in freshness. Cleaner than Uhura&#x27;s ear piece and smoother than Jim Kurk picking up a green gal, everyone around you will know you are a man of distinction.  This scent is for the confident male who doesn&#x27;t need to show off to attract attention. The cool man who takes time to enjoy some sword play and can relax with Scottie and some well aged scotch. This scent will move you to the front of Star Fleet Academy and have you out of that death trap red shirt and into a gold shirt faster than you can say Kobayashi Maru. The ladies and men alike will say \\&quot;Eau myyyyyy, who is this attractive cadet?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Fragrance customer&#x27;s log: Stardate 91563.54&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you&#x27;re front and center at the helm or braving the heat of engineering,&lt;br /&gt;one whiff of this cologne and your prey will be begging for your hailing frequency.&lt;br /&gt;Even the pon farr is no match for driving them wild like this scent can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also doubles as a defense weapon at the first sign of tribble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you to boldly G&#x27;eau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in it?  Dammit!  I&#x27;m a customer not a chemist!</li>
    <li> After returning to Earth on an epic 5 year journey of exploration, I saw a post by a former Starfleet member on a social network site, so I decided to check it out. After trying a couple of sprays, I didn&#x27;t know what the big deal was.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: I am now being chased around Saturn by Khan, who now wants to marry me.&lt;br /&gt;Khaaan... I have some more?</li>
    <li> I used this cologne and suddenly I look as young as George Takei!! I will definitely recommend this to all of my older friends!</li>
    <li> Set your phasers to stun to fight off the Klingons who will tribble in delight at your out of this world scent.  Boldly go to the store before stock ships out.  You Kahn be the talk of the fleet with this Enterprising new scent.</li>
    <li> Everyone in the locker room reeked of Axe.  When i sprayed this everyone who had bathed in Axe suddenly burst into flames and was reduced to pile of ashes.  Then suddenly the locker room wall collapsed and i was ambushed by a wave of naked ladies of all size shape and color (I think some men had slipped in there as well).  They all clung to me refusing to let go.  As they breathed the smell i realized this was more than a cologne.  This was the greatest smelling cologne in the known world.  As i started to get crushed by the woman all i could say was, &amp;#34;Oh myy.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Nothing says sexy like a shirtless George Takei, swashbuckling his way into our hearts. I know that&#x27;s what made me gay-seeing his rippling pecs while holding Uhura hostage. This cologne was bottled directly from his manly musk created during that episode (The Naked Time-OH MYYYY!) and doesn&#x27;t everyone want to get the girl (or guy? *wink wink, George*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS. NOW. BEAM IT TO YOUR HOUSE. HIT BUY. George has a warp core that needs repair so he can travel back in time and bottle more. Won&#x27;t someone please save the chronotons?</li>
    <li> Drive the Klingon in you in to a frenzy, make your Vulcan leave his logic, make your Terran, terrific!  Imported from the four corners of the Omega quadrant! We are proud to bring you, Eau My! The fragrance of conquest, the choice scent of Empire Builders and Daring Explorers! For those who love the smell of phasers in the morning! Available in Andorian blue.  Coming soon in Orion Green, Martian Red, Vulcan Violet and Borg Black (Ok. Not really 😉 )</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s that time of year again. That time where you have to deal with the life sucking creatures known as \\&quot;family\\&quot;. This really is the perfect time for Eau My. You can wear it, sure, but the real usefulness comes after you&#x27;ve drank all of your liquor, all of your mouthwash and all of your hand sanitizer in an effort to tune out your loved ones, you can always resort to drinking Eau My. And Eau My it is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*disclaimer: not for consumption. Please don&#x27;t sue me because you&#x27;re stupid.</li>
    <li> This product, let me tell you, is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I first found out about this through Facebook. Not the usual place I would go to for suggestions on how to smell, but there it was. &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll give it a whirl&amp;#34; I thought, and I wore some to a night out in my town.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I will not bore you with the details, but it turns out that this stuff will take your sex drive into Warp Factor 9, at least! My friends were astounded by the amount of beautiful women were jostling to get close to me, to bask in my beautiful odour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to George Takei I&#x27;m now very much a ladies man. I have to keep them at bay with a half-brick in a sock, which I swing around me to maintain my personal space.</li>
    <li> shoulder to shoulder with the guy who just  did a 20 mile bike ride to get tofu from his favorite vegan grocer and I just think, Eau My!</li>
    <li> As a person with Asperger&#x27;s syndrome, I find it difficult to socialize with other students of my university, but when I wore Eau My on my person for the first time, many in my classes sniffed and ejaculated &amp;#34;Oh, my!&amp;#34; This has given me a gateway to relatively easy small talk, with which I have struggled all my life.</li>
    <li> I have concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloging gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant. We&#x27;re heading home under full impulse power, with a boost from Eau My, a gaseous anomaly we captured on our quest. We are now fully operating with our shields down. We recommend Starfleet gather more Eau My for the success of future missions and to ensure we continue to go where no one has gone before.</li>
    <li> One spray, just one! I&#x27;d had a few drinks and thought it would be ok. Now I think I&#x27;m pregnant :(</li>
    <li> With the litany of humorous reviews, I thought perhaps a more serious one would be helpful albeit less entertaining. How often do people buy scents they never smell? Rarely; me...never. I took a chance on George Takei&#x27;s Eau My and I am pleasantly surprised. Lacking any experience in describing scents or their sources let me do my best to convey:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light and fresh, almost like a fresh linen smell, airy, not heavy, a touch of spice and as it settles in it takes on a pheromone -like character; almost a mild sweat like a mildly hot &amp; bothered perspiration, not sweaty dirty, that my wife says made her head turn (it HAD to be the cologne after 22 years of marriage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a floral note (freesia?) that could be a bit off-putting to guys that prefer spicy, woodsy or heavier night scents. If you like Acqua di Gio, Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue or similar, you will like this.</li>
    <li> First of all, who doesn&#x27;t love everything Takei? My husband and I enjoy reading Mr. Takei&#x27;s social media posts and especially his Amazon reviews; he makes us laugh and makes us think. So it seemed like fun to try his cologne as a Christmas present for dh. I am not at all surprised that it smells fantastic; Mr. Takei wouldn&#x27;t put his name on it if it weren&#x27;t fabulous.</li>
    <li> Since my husband started wearing Eau My I&#x27;m in a permanent state of Red Alert. Oh Myyyyyyyyy.</li>
    <li> My Man loves Star Trek and anything that has to do with it. I was impressed of how good the fragrance really smells. So take that Han Solo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars just for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger (larger) size.  So far I wore it to work twice and both times a co-worker asked me what I was wearing, and that they love the scent.  for myself I love the fresh smell, would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This smells alright, and the bottle is very cool looking. There isn&#x27;t really anything unique about the scent, it smells like men&#x27;s cologne. It&#x27;s not as nice as 212 or Armani, but for the price, it is decent cologne.</li>
    <li> My husband got this for me for Valentines day and I absolutely love it! So light and clean and refreshing. Most signature colognes are overly strong, you smell like you have bathed in the stuff and they can be so irritating on your skin, but not Eau My, it is totally different. You start with the more ginger musky scents and it quickly turns to the citrus with just a hint of the jasmine and it lasts, It is really fabulous. This is a great fragrance for women and something special for men. I am now wearing it everyday and it has become my fragrance.</li>
    <li> So I bought my boyfriend Eau My for Valentine&#x27;s. And it legitimately smells wonderful. Floral yet spicy, teasing yet professional. Clean. So kinda like slightly gay, sexy laundry. I really like it and his very selective shnozz approved of it. This is the &#x27;need 25 min to pick out a new cologne and will smell everything&#x27; guy. I am impressed with Takei&#x27;s scent mixers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, if you (like me) are synesthetic, I&#x27;ll mention that it is orangey but soft and bluegreen with some pink tones and the greyblue of male pheremones underneath. Bit of red. It fades to purplish pink though. On my skin anyway; yes, you can also wear this cologne if you&#x27;re a lady, and it won&#x27;t smell odd the way some other brands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Do you know how many nameless red shirts I have managed to bed wearing this cologne?  On top of that I have do unmentionable thing to bald women, furry women, green women, and the occasional Tribble (that one I&#x27;m not proud of but I chalk it up to a life experience… live and learn).  Would I buy this again, simply put, hell yes.  I cannot imagine a would without Eau My.  It added the little bit of pizzaz my game was missing to help seal the deal.  Thank you Uncle George for helping me boldly go where no man has been before.</li>
    <li> Every Christmas Eve when my sister and I were young we would always look forward to visiting our Great Grandma Kay. Her tree was always perfect, an unknown number of Siamese cats hid in various places around her house, the back of her toilet had a lovely mirror that showed young boys \\&quot;look who Jesus loves\\&quot; (but as the boys grew, Jesus&#x27; love changed to be the joke of the family only poor old Gramma Kay didn&#x27;t get). And then there was the piano, which proved this wonderful woman had more patience than I believe I&#x27;ll ever possess, she&#x27;d let us clang the keys for hours on end never complaining.&lt;br /&gt;One day in December, Gramma Kay was walking around her living room, tidying up, while my sister and I played Jingle Bells on the piano with one key as we sang along. As Gramma bent down to pick up a fallen ornament, and just as we had sung \\&quot;jingle bells, jingle bells\\&quot; she let out a loud, squeaky toot, straightened up as far as her hunched over back would allow with wide eyes and uttered \\&quot;Oh My\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;To this day, my favorite Christmas song is Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells (make a fart noise) Oh My!&lt;br /&gt;I hope that Eau My does not have the same aroma as my childhood memory, but having a bottle, I would be reminded of her every time I used it. I give this a 5 star review for not only probably smelling much better than Taylor Swift, Beibs or Spears, but for coming with a name that I will always smile when I see.</li>
    <li> Putting on Eau My Cologne Spray may cause sudden urges to jump on Comic-con stages and sign Trekkies autograph books. Then there are the other benefits, like gaining a deep basso profundo voice that is great for both Broadway and off-Broadway plays, talking to the masses at Pride parades, and being very positively vocal in the LGBT community. Plus you get to be friends with other Enterprise soundstage cast members.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone needs a bottle of Eau My. Why? Because Takei.</li>
    <li> I just want to win a free bottle, so I&#x27;m writing this review.. It&#x27;s freaking amazing.. I love it.. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Geroge Takei has delivered a scent for the classy gent. Eau my allows anyone&#x27;s personal bouquet to  reflect the unbridled passion and beauty within. Subtle notes tantalize even the most drab passersby. Please enjoy responsibly. Using this product in no way consitutes bathing. Eau my is the stunning scent for any guy (or gal).</li>
    <li> I stared all a quiver, the ad made me shiver.&lt;br /&gt;What manna is this from our dear Uncle George?&lt;br /&gt;I grasped tightly the mouse, my gasp rang through the house,&lt;br /&gt;A cologne scented like the great Sulu? Amour!&lt;br /&gt;With decisive clicks, I was done in mere ticks,&lt;br /&gt;Amazon shall ship it straight to my door&lt;br /&gt;My order is placed, my heart beats apace!&lt;br /&gt;I shall wait for the day, when I can smell like Takei.</li>
    <li> This fine product suited me well, until Thanksgiving that is. I was passing around a mister bottle of it, and everyone sampled. My father suddenly was wearing a gold shirt, and started yelling &amp;#34;Beth, this turkey needs, more, power!&amp;#34; My mother started speaking in some foreign tongue, I think it was Irish. My brother-in-law kept trying to heal the turkey, and the dog suddenly started saying &amp;#34;Fascinating&amp;#34;. Everyone else made shirts out of the red tablecloth and I haven&#x27;t seen them since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started taking fencing lessons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> eau my made my mate say eau yes. best evening together we ever had. caution not for everyone. buyer beware</li>
    <li> This is a quality fragrance, well worth the price!  It makes a perfect gift for any George Takei fan, young or old.  Thanks, Uncle George, for another quality product!</li>
    <li> Do you want to smell Jungle fresh?  Then this is the scent for you or the Tarzan in your life. Help this Celebrity out here with your purchase, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Face, the final frontier. This is place (and also the neck and stomach) where you apply cologne. In an up-and-down motion. To spray out onto new and not-so-new body parts. To boldy mist where no one has misted before. Be M-Classy... Eau My.</li>
    <li> When going out on blind dates, none of the ladies would take me serious. But then i found Eau My purely by chance, and now ladies can not get their hands off of me. Before i knew it, i was being swarmed by the classiest of tekkie and trekker nerds of the female persuasion whose knowledge of Star Trek far out-classed that of my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This does not work with fans of the newer Star Trek movies. Something about someone named, what was it, Pine i think.</li>
    <li> Coming to us from near Khitomer and bearing the name of an officer and a gentlemen who enjoys gentlemen, this is truly a scent from another world.  So unreal is the simple beauty of this cologne that, even when sitting pretty in your captain&#x27;s chair having coffee, you&#x27;ll surely shout &amp;#34;Oh my!&amp;#34; at all the attention you get.  All hands are sure to be on deck quickly, probably beyond the transwarp threshold.</li>
    <li> What a great product! Light years ahead of Harrison Ford&#x27;s line of scents; &amp;#34;I Kneau.&amp;#34; His scents have too much force.</li>
    <li> Forget the phasers, set smell to stunning! Even the Borg won&#x27;t be able to resist you wear Eau My! Engage!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good words about this cologne by Mr. Takei … primarily because it smelled so good that I thought it might taste just as wonderful. It does not. And hopefully I’ll regain the use of my tongue soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as far as the scent – It’s out of this world! It’s an enterprising blend of a light, clean, somewhat sweet smelling scent, with just a hint of woodsy musk undertones to give one that commanding captain-like authority that will leave that special someone stunned. If you have a special lady you want to swoon, other scents probably wouldn’t phaser, but with Eau My, you’re trekking in the right direction to take your romance to warp speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it Takei! … I mean, today!</li>
    <li> Turned my red shirt to blue after just one spray.  I will now live long and prosper.  Thanks Uncle George!</li>
    <li> For a metal-head, this fragrance keeps me in shape without even going to the gym!&lt;br /&gt;It keeps the wannabees at a clare distance, and it gets my mom to give me money on my monthly visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend more than two bottles a day though, the third one gave me acid reflux.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eaul Hails!&lt;br /&gt;Eurogod</li>
    <li> If you really want to smell like Takei, I would suggest cutting out the middle man and rubbing yourself against him in the night.</li>
    <li> I was surfing my facebook and I noticed that George put out Eau My on Amazon so I decided to order it.  I waited patiently for 8 days for it to arrive (I am sadly too cheap to pay for express shipping), however, it did not show up for the 9th day.  The last 24 hours it took for it to show up almost put me into a &amp;#34;hissy fit&amp;#34; because I felt that Amazon had lied to me...then I realized there was a holiday in the 8 days, and I had to forgive them....When I received &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34;, I waited until a Saturday Night to try it on while going out for a night on the town.  Promptly at 10 pm, after taking a shower to wash of the &amp;#34;Kirk de&#x27; leau&amp;#34; I was wearing earlier, I splashed myself with Eau My to prepare myself to the night.  Little did I know, instantly I was TRANSPORTED to another reality.  This reality was full of young eager studs ready to fulfill my desires....It seams that after a few cocktails, and tails...the  cologne finally wore off and I was not only exhausted, but extremely satisfied.....Thanks George!</li>
    <li> I was in the middle of a losing battle of, &amp;#34;Star Wars vs Star Trek,&amp;#34; when I excused myself to freshen up.  I grabbed my bottle of Eau My, applied moderately, came back to the argument, and instantly won it.  Even Wesley Crusher won vs Han Solo after the competition fell victim to my secret weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem solved.  Problem staying solved.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to mince words,so I&#x27;ll just say a few things.&lt;br /&gt;This scent will draw out your inner self, the one you sometimes glimpse when you glance sideways in the mirror, your best self..&lt;br /&gt;It has the power to bring out that feeling you had as a 8 year old dreamer again, but with the knowledge, wisdom and desires of a fully grown adult. If this describes you, then this is what you want. Or better yet, a gift for that person you know yearns to be free&#x27;d!&lt;br /&gt;(Remember, whats the point of growing up if you cant have a little fun along the way?)&lt;br /&gt;This is not a fragrance, it&#x27;s an experience, a liberation, It opens doors that you didn&#x27;t even know existed and protects you from paths best not ventured.&lt;br /&gt;Your sense of humor will autmagically improve, and who doesn&#x27;t want a bit of that!&lt;br /&gt;The short answer... this Cologne will make you more attractive to yourself, And by THAT VERY FACT, will effect anyone you show interest in the very same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isnt a Cologne, this is... magic.&lt;br /&gt;And we all know magic comes with a price.&lt;br /&gt;So use it with kindness and caring, with joy and giving. Make the world a better place, even if just a bit And your rewards will be far more than you could possibly imagine.</li>
    <li> I bought this for every guy I know. Now, not only am I constantly surrounded by by the citrus-y clean scent of George Takei, but the men in my life have all become more fashion savvy, and sensitive. If you want to smell like unicorns playing in the rain, buy this now. (And seriously, who DOESN&#x27;T want to smell like unicorns playing in the rain!?!?)</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this for me for Christmas.  No puns or what not from me here.  The scent is actually very nice.  Subtle but distinguishable without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my husband and he loved it. Very nice scent if I may say so myself as well.</li>
    <li> at first I was skeptical about this cologne, would it do what I thought it would do? Would it get me more strange Tang then Kirk beaming down on a new m-class planet? Would it help me boldly go where no nerd has gone before?&lt;br /&gt;Well fellow crew members, I am pleased to report that my away team mission was a success. After spritzing on \\&quot;EauMy\\&quot; I was beaming with newfound energy and attracted the attention of several female species like a modified photon torpedo to the ion trail of a cloaked Klingon warbird. This stuff is as effective as a Vulcan neck pinch, a real knockout...</li>
    <li> I got this cologne for Xmas and whenever I wear it I feel fabulous!  I am now able to drive or pilot a starship with ease...</li>
    <li> The moment i opened the box i swear the glow of heaven filled the room as the bottle levitated and a deep voice came out of nowhere telling me i have been blessed with chick magnetism as soon as i went to apply a spray i immediately stopped and applied it the right way by wearing a monacle while applying a spray as soon as i left about 30 women jumped me with hugs and kisses and even more towards night the morning after i was served court papers by axe body spray suing me for attracting every female even their staff making their product inferior ....i also tasted it a bit and transformed to fabio instantly</li>
    <li> Bought this for my geeky son-in-law. Surprisingly, he had no knowledge of the product, so his first response was priceless. But then, once he opened it and tried some on, it became clear that he would appreciate it for the quality of the cologne and not just the geek factor - which I love, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think either men or women would be happy wearing this cologne. It has a pleasant, light tone.</li>
    <li> Before, your fragrance might have been questioning which gender it preferred to attract, possibly been afraid to say which one  aloud. Not any more. Now that Eau My is out, you can be assured the fragrance has decided on the right person for you. YOU. Yes, you. This gender friendly cologne spritzes on and can help attract whichever gender(s) that makes you happy.&lt;br /&gt;Be happy! Wear it! The subtle mandarin zest and Italian bergamot teasing your nose are sure to put a smile on your face as well as the face of that special someone. And when they say &#x27;Oh my! What is that delectable fragrance you have on?&#x27; you can answer, &#x27;Yes.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Whether you be male or female, gay or straight (or hell, all of the above), just remeber: It&#x27;s OK to smell like Takei!</li>
    <li> Finally we can all smell the way a respectable Starfleet Officer should, Whether it be fighting against the Romulans, negotiating a peace-treaty with the Klingon Empire or meeting the fate of your red shirted counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to set your phasers to stunning and.......Make it so!</li>
    <li> Oh myyy... Eau my is the most FANTASTERRABULOUS fragrance ever invented ever...  if you are a straight man, after using this several of your gentleman friends may boldly go where no man has gone before.... by that I mean Uranus!  So be careful on how much you use because you don&#x27;t want too many ass-tronuats trying to land in Uranus all at once.</li>
    <li> My hubby got me &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; for Valentine&#x27;s Day and am I ever glad he did! It is wonderful and I feel FABULOUS in it. He loves the way it smells on me too!!! I am so thankful to Mr. Takei!!!</li>
    <li> Opened the box, sprayed on my neck, smells good. At the end of the day, I take shirt off... still smells good.</li>
    <li> Just received this today in time for my birthday, and what a wonderful birthday gift it is. The fragrance is not overpowering like most colognes and perfumes I have had or smelled before. It&#x27;s a very enjoyable scent. The packaging is also very sleek and perfect for the fragrance as well. I was going to share this with my boyfriend but I think I may just keep it for myself. I would definitely recommend this to anyone even if you aren&#x27;t a fan of colognes, it is nice to have if you are a fan of Uncle George. :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again.</li>
    <li> I am a 33 year old virgin male. That is to say, I WAS a 33 year old virgin male. I have always had trouble with women. After purchasing this cologne and trying it on, I went for a stroll. When I passed a woman, I could literally hear her eggs dropping as she was thrown into heat. I&#x27;ll admit, I ran in fear as women began to throw themselves at me on the street. Attempting to evade my pursuers, I found myself cornered in an alley behind a White Castle. Surrounded by sexed up women of all shapes and sizes, I could not help but submit. They pinned me to the alley floor and took turns, sometimes two or three at a time. The air was full of the smell of sweat, love and fried onions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I suggest participating in a violent alley orgy? No.&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend Eau My? Hell Yes.</li>
    <li> My friend told me that I would be stunned when I saw this.  She took it in stride; the lovely aroma just didn&#x27;t phaser.  My love for this may make no scents to anyone else, but Mr. Takei&#x27;s cologne is a great new addition to his thriving business Enterprise.</li>
    <li> I was fairly skeptical before buying this product.  I read through some of the comments left by others before purchasing and thought that this product couldn&#x27;t be that good, but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I lifted the bottle from it&#x27;s protective box and after a few test sprays applied one spray to myself.  That&#x27;s when things got interesting.  Normally I can&#x27;t seem to get guys to notice me when I&#x27;m walking around campus, but that day was different, I couldn&#x27;t keep them off me.  Classes were difficult because I kept getting grabbed at and the professor couldn&#x27;t seem to keep his mind on what he was talking about.  I had to run from class to class hiding amongst the trees in hopes that I would be lust mauled by dozens of men.  I finally made it home and found my roommate in my room ravenous from the smell of &amp;#34;Eau My.&amp;#34; I was finally able to take a shower to get it off me, I spent 15 minutes in that shower, my roommate spent 15 hours in the bathroom after that until the scent had dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice if you get this product, is to take up some sort of martial arts so that you can fend off the hordes of men who will clamor after you when you spray the spray, and it will leave you saying, &amp;#34;Eau My.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. works for women too, but that&#x27;s boring...</li>
    <li> This is the worst mouthwash I have ever tasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the sweet box it came in is a great place to store emergency supplies, like bandages, toilet paper, and scotch. You know, the essentials. So not a total bust.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; by George Takei is not just a Cologne Spray, it&#x27;s the rescue in every life-threatening situation.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a room scent after those 3-Days-Star-Trek-Marathons my boyfriend used to hold in our house.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Cuz it&#x27;s always getting a little smelly in here when he and his pals stay for the whole weekend, not showering and trying to deep-fry everything they can find. Tomatoes, Sandwiches, ice cream, soft cheese, chocolate bars...&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t support my usual room scent but they where ok with Takei.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you George! It was the first time I could enter the living room without wearing a gas mask.</li>
    <li> Eau My indeed! A must for every sexy nerd out there! Show them all that a true trekkie is a sexy tekkie!</li>
    <li> This cologne will help you discover a new you. And that new you is George Takei. You&#x27;ll find yourself magically transformed into the life of the party, even at work when you&#x27;re copying a newspaper. &amp;#34;She can&#x27;t take much more of this captain.&amp;#34; is your motto; A drop or two in the morning (phasers set to stun), maybe a little splash for that big date (red alert), or the whole bottle for that important meeting (an &#x27;incident&#x27; on Praxis). You can tailor-make your daily experience, and this will help you every step of the way. As if that weren&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s a shade of misty blue that will bring to mind scenes of adventure in fantasy worlds as yet unimaginable to you. And don&#x27;t even get me started on the bottle cap...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adventure awaits...</li>
    <li> I used to smell like I Shatner&#x27;d myself before I discovered Eau My Cologne. Now, every time is the Naked Time.  Thanks, George!</li>
    <li> I may be tempted to switch brands.  Can Eau My really deliver?  Don&#x27;t lie to me.  Don&#x27;t.  Just don&#x27;t.  [...]</li>
    <li> Because that&#x27;s the only way I&#x27;d procreate.  I&#x27;ve never wanted kids, but if I could be assured that George was going to be reincarnated in my womb (30 years or so from now) I&#x27;d have that fabulous baby.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t give you the experience of a seasoned Starfleet officer. It won&#x27;t impart to you the wisdom of a public servant who co-created a city subway system. It won&#x27;t make your own life story the inspiration for a moving stage musical. It won&#x27;t transform your speaking voice into a deep, resonant baritone that seduces all who hear it. No, &#x27;Eau My&#x27; can&#x27;t turn you into an epic space adventurer/Tom Bradley appointee/star of stage and screen/cultural icon/international hero. But it will make you smell like one.</li>
    <li> Having been a fan of Mr. Takei since the 70&#x27;s, I was indeed excited to see what kind of product he&#x27;d be willing to attach his name to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had been dismal and overcast all week long. Par for the Buffalo area and its infectious gloom. So I was somewhat uplifted by the ring of the doorbell heralding my delivery. The brown-clad deliveryman was much like the weather, maudlin, cold and bent on making everyone get up early to shovel their cars out of their driveways in the morning. It was the way he looked at me through those horn-rimmed glasses and over that large nose and mustache that clued me in to that last part. I smiled in his general direction and accepted the desired package. I felt it was going to be an interesting night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set the package down on the reading table next to the recliner, went into the kitchen, and made myself a cup of tea that had the qualities of lordship, shades, and heat one might desire when expecting an encounter. I gently traded my cup for the package on the table. It was light, and very very brown. I shed that hue from my prize and excised the small, compact bottle of Mr. Takei&#x27;s \\&quot;Eau My 1.7 oz Cologne Spray\\&quot;. After deliberating over the bottle for a minute or so, I spritzed each wrist once, and then my neck in a potent trident.&lt;br /&gt;I was not nearly as overwhelmed as I thought I would be. The scent was light and playful, but also brilliant and dangerous... like a fencer, one far better than myself... as a fencer, that is.&lt;br /&gt;I sat to enjoy my tea. As I did, the scent of the parfum overlaid it. I hadn&#x27;t thought that the scent would affect the flavor of my tea (as scents often do), but it did give the beverage a certain \\&quot;Je n&#x27;sais quand.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I set the empty cup down, reclined, and pondered the marvelous scent as it wove into my nostrils... and my consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, it was as though I was slapped by an Indiana man playing \\&quot;Helicopter\\&quot;. Using the chair like a loose catapult, I sprang up and landed easily onthe balls of my feet. I felt like a jungle cat! The night would be mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set straight to my closet and pulled out combinations of things I never had before. I was seeing color schemes, seasons, lines. I can barely describe how I felt and what I was doing, but when I was done, I was... oh, what&#x27;s that word.... &#x27;Fantastic!&#x27;.... close enough. I called a cab service to take me out, but not just any cab service. It was a party bus.&lt;br /&gt;I got on and said, \\&quot;Dancing!\\&quot;. The driver immediately put on &#x27;Rock and Roll Band&#x27; and bounced that bus into the city! (Okay, Buffalo... close enough)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my tennis shoes, black khaki&#x27;s, pin-striped coal jacket and fedora, I strode through the door like a lord. For a moment, all eyes went to me and time froze. The place was darkly lit and bustling. There was a dance floor. Time started back up the moment my foot hit the floor. My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult was playing. With a twinkle in my eye and a wink,  I handed my fedora to a svelte young man in velvet (say that five times... for fun) and for the next twelve minutes of extended remix, I tore a fierce signature in that floor. By the time I was done a dozen or so joined in and we cooked up a new dance trend.&lt;br /&gt;I surreptitiously spritzed myself once more and then waved at the bartender. \\&quot;Next round on the house!\\&quot;, he declared! Cheers went up and one of the foxes in my group said, \\&quot;We really need to eat something if we want this night to go on.\\&quot;. There were many nods of agreement as we realized this was the answer we sought all along.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Burritos then!\\&quot;, I triumphantly declared. There were cheers and entreaties to haste as we climbed on the party bus and departed to a local place. It was hopping with young cats having a great time. I don&#x27;t know why considering it&#x27;s against state health codes to have live animals where food is made. The crew I was with was totally into them, so, hey, why not?&lt;br /&gt;We ordered food with great antici.... oh, and I forgot thatwe did order burritos as planned. That&#x27;s important in a minute... pation.&lt;br /&gt;As we were doing some dance other than The Macarena, Jesus came out of the kitchen. He was a burly Latino chef with a great sense of humor and good food to match. He seemed to be distressed. I said, \\&quot;What&#x27;s up, my guy?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The tortillas are stale! The boxes weren&#x27;t in order!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Just then, I had an idea. There had to be a way, and there was. I said, \\&quot;Damn the tortillas, we&#x27;ll steam them instead!\\&quot;. And steam them he did! With steam in a steamer they came out quite... f... &#x27;fine&#x27;! We dined for a time and laughed into the night and went on dancing until it was light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But the hour was late and we had another world to return to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bade my friends adieu, and began to walk to the bus. I came shortly upon a group of people. They were banded together wearing tricorn hats and bags of tea. Carrying signs, they were angry and loud, but really afraid of things they didn&#x27;t understand. As I approached them, I thought, \\&quot;They could really use a shot of THIS!\\&quot;. My mind not in my head, I pulled out the bottle and emptied its entire contents over myself. The mob surrounded me, I went down to my knees knowing only one of two things could possibly happen.&lt;br /&gt;After a few very anxious moments, I happily realized that &#x27;Eau My&#x27; did not make me quite delicious enough to be immediately cannibalized by the mob. But I could see it was having its intended effect. The fear melted out of all of them, and the anger with it. They left that spot and began buying food and blankets for the hungry and homeless. All over the nation, their members stopped being angry and started to be kind. There were, I noted, exactly 100 of them in the group that I encountered. I don&#x27;t monkey around with numbers.&lt;br /&gt;The wave of kindness spread, and crime and poverty slowly dissipated across the nation. It was truly a whole new world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to the bus, and looked at the bus driver. He said, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t yourecognize me?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I said \\&quot;No, I don&#x27;t.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Perhaps if I put this back on...\\&quot;, and he produced a Groucho Marx mask.&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, I realized, \\&quot;You&#x27;re the deliveryman that brought me my package!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Why yes, yes I am, and I have something to say...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was aquiver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;You are FAAAAABULOUS!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT was the word! And damn, I felt it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was a blinding flash, it was as though a light from the sky was taking me apart molecule by molecule. \\&quot;Am I getting beamed?\\&quot;, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a flash, I was back in the recliner. The bottle of George Takei&#x27;s \\&quot;Eau My\\&quot; still full on the reading table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say with confidence that this scent runs with the finest I have sampled, including Calvin&amp;Hobbes  #4. I know that the next time I go out, whether for business or for fun, I&#x27;ll be flaunting \\&quot;Eau My 1.7-oz Cologne Spray\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Now I just have to get more of that tea.</li>
    <li> This cologne is so amazing, it reminds me of the time I was splashed by Unicorn sweat. It has a manly yet soft scent that makes your insides tumble with joy! This special concoction of pheromones and glitter will make even the ugliest man or woman more desirable to all who encounter them! This should really be called magic in the bottle, because the wonders will amaze all! If you can&#x27;t attract a mate wearing this, then you should bathe in it! If you can&#x27;t bathe in it, then just apply very heavily and drop your standards! Eau what excitement you can have, using Eau My... And like Uncle George says, set phasers to STUNNING... If all else fails use phaser on yourself...</li>
    <li> I bought this with hopes of attracting someone of the opposite sex and in hopes to get their number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the only number I got was from Bill Shatner... but at least he offered to give me a reach around.</li>
    <li> Tribble musk, a rare and impossibly difficult ingredient to gather gives this scent a perfectly balanced, superbly crafted waft. Highly paid Starfleet Officers train for years at the ancient art of Tribble milking so that they can smell amazing.  Great news! You can have all the smell with none of the work. Have your eye on the buxom green skinned beauty over in Engineering?  Spray away.  She won&#x27;t be able to help but say Eau My every time you walk by.</li>
    <li> Like Romulan Ale, &#x27;Eau My&#x27; is illegal in all sectors of the Federation due to its compelling fragrance that drives males, females, and androgynous species from any planet wild with desire.  It also repels the pesky Q so you can enjoy a relaxing evening in Ten Forward with that special someone without fear of being called to the bridge for a red alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether on duty or shore leave, &#x27;Eau My&#x27; will calm the savage beast within and leave you feeling confident in the knowledge that you are a man who wears only the finest fragrance that credits will buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember the now famous words of James T. Kirk as he took his last breath on Veridian III, requesting only one thing, \\&quot;Eau My.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> A friend bought me Eau My and it was time to try it out since I was facing a night out and about with people half of whom I didn&#x27;t know as much as I should like and half of whom I liked less than half as well as they deserve. But off I went and people on the street kept complimenting me on how awesome I smelled. I was almost at the club when a limo pulled up next to me and some guy in a bathrobe asked me out for dinner. What could I do other than say yes? Sure, he looked sort of average and his friend robot was too depressed to be any fun but I figured why the hell not? The driver got us to a restaurant at the end of the universe. The place was crowded, let me tell you. We did get a table but had to share it with a man and a Rodian bounty hunter who were having a huge argument over who shot first. It was still nice though, and we decided to go for a walk on the promenade on Mars where a hooker offered me her three teats and a threesome with a man named Douglas. I politely declined and me and my date walked on. We came by a pet store that offered 99 fluffy chirping animals for the price of one. This is where the guy from the restaurant caught up with us and offered us a ride in his space ship which was the fastest in the sector. We almost took him up on his offer but when he babbled about some Kessel run he had done in less than 12 parsecs I got suspicious and declined because we all know that parsecs is not a unit of speed. Weirdo. Instead my date took me for another drink at a bar named Quark&#x27;s on Terok Nor, or Deep Space Nine, since it had been renamed recently. I played some rounds of dabo and lost, and had a few drinks at the bar next to an alien that didn&#x27;t say a word the whole time. Maybe his babelfish was dead. Anyway, as my date and I were debating whether or not Weyland-Yutani should do another expedition to retrieve more eggs to successfully breed facehuggers as commercial pets, a man in a brown coat stepped in and histrionically spread his arms and proclaimed: \\&quot;Friends, they burnt my land\\&quot;, he took a deep breath, \\&quot;they boiled the sea\\&quot;, he pointed towards the ceiling, \\&quot;they can&#x27;t take the sky from me.\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t help it, I had to laugh. I mean, we were on a space station. He couldn&#x27;t say more because two dinosaurs walked in and pushed him aside. One dinosaur yelled something about this being his land while the other cursed him and his sudden but inevitable betrayal. My date and I decided that this was getting way out of hand so we got the hell out of there and went for a picnic in a park called Jurassic. It was beautiful though I must admit that I felt as if I was being watched the whole time. Still, it was the best date I had ever had. We decided to end it on a mellow note and went to a poetry slam on Vogsphere. Now, I don&#x27;t know much about poetry or Vogons but something tells me those two don&#x27;t go well together. We managed to sneak out and drove home where instead of my house and my home planet for that matter someone had built an interstellar expressway. I managed to get a room on the Enterprise where I bumped into George. Of course I had to tell him right away how awesome his perfume was and how it had gotten me the best date in my life, and he smiled at me knowlingly and winked. Something chirped in my pocket, oh damn, I forgot that I had gotten one of those fluffy things. But George looked at it and ran away. I think we do have a vermin problem now. But man are they cute....oh my. I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> Tastes a bit strong, with a lingering after taste, may need to age a bit more, 18 plus age rating required</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my husband. He likes it but I think it smells a little punny.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance like a fat lady loves apples.  Makes me want to take Charles Atlas by the ... hand.&lt;br /&gt;All the romance and heat of a Steve Reeves movie in one fabulous bottle.  If you&#x27;ve ever wondered whether d&#x27;Artagnan swashbuckled with his fellow musketeers, wonder no more.  All for one and one for ... Oh My!</li>
    <li> Like most cold blooded industrialists of the cosmetic industry, I enjoy testing products on cute and cuddly animals. For my consumer review of \\&quot;Eau My\\&quot; Cologne, I decided that it would be fitting and proper to test it on Tribbles.  Not only did they stop breeding, they&#x27;re all dead!</li>
    <li> This is not a cologne to be sniffed or whiffed, it is to be gently, slowly inhaled and allowed to penetrate the senses. As the delicate tones of exotic mandarin orange and royal bergamot swirl around your head, allow yourself to be transported to the furthest regions of the Orient on a gentle breeze of night jasmine, freesia and ginger that teases you to your very core.  You will find yourself involuntarily breathing the words &amp;#34;eau my&amp;#34; as the musky undertone pulls you down and wraps you ever so gently in its arms.  No man can escape the teasing of this heady, erotic scent. Don&#x27;t try to resist...it is futile.</li>
    <li> WWWWWWOOOOOWWWWWW With one spray of Eau My I was beamed aboard the USS Enterprise (Thanks Scotty). I have always wanted to be apart of the United Federation of Planets Starfleet and with this handy little bottle I got my chance. Once aboard the Enterprise I checked my shirt color... not red PHEW! Luckily I was dawning a perfect yellow Starfleet shirt, my chances of survival on the Enterprise just increased WOOO!! Unfortunately I had just boarded the ship when Khan decided to wage war on Starfleet, can you say bad timing?! We traveled warp speed to the Bajoran moon where the ship came face to face with some very unhappy Klingons.. Never a dull moment aboard the Enterprise. To make a long story short, you are probably asking why would I give Eau My a 4 star rating when I got beamed up on to the Enterprise and had an adventure of a lifetime?!!?!? Because apparently I got so excited when I sprayed the cologne that I jumped up and bumped my head, which means this cologne causes extreme excitement to a point where you bump your head and believe a day dream that takes place on the USS Enterprise. It should probably come with an excitement warning label. I guess the good news is now I smell great and I have a wild imagination.. I would how ever like to know how Sulu&#x27;s sword got stuck in my couch and Uhura&#x27;s bra in my freezer(I can&#x27;t believe she writes her name on her clothes)...maybe it wasn&#x27;t a dream after all...</li>
    <li> 100% FABULOUS! I loved the sense of pride, and the sense of wonderful aroma that has come from adding this to my collection!</li>
    <li> Hell... It will make you and others horny. You will love it and so will anyone you give it too</li>
    <li> The latest and greatest from the man who flipped Guard over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t call him, or this sensational cologne tiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must buy for any human, Klingon, Romulan or Vulcan in need of an out of this world aroma!</li>
    <li> There are many diffwatches fragrances out there, buy Eau My! Is different. You see each and every bottle is personally touched by George Himself! He sits down and watches bambi and as he is crying his tears are bottled. They take these tears mix them with a pinch of unicorn hair and a splash of rainbow.... and Presto! You have a hand crafted bottle of Eau My! Enjoy the true experience of George himself with every spray! All the Men and Woman will bottle practically speechless. .. only able to mutter \\&quot;Eau My...\\&quot;</li>
    <li> She sprayed this on me from a sample bottle in the local supermarket. Eau my god.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t  go into the details but she became suddenly very amorous. Overjoyed I lost sense of time and place and got out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are not welcome there any more.&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s red sweater is missing, but we are not allowed to fetch it.</li>
    <li> If there was ever one person both my wife and I wished each other could smell like, it&#x27;s George Takei.  And now we can!  And do.  And it&#x27;s all a bit confusing.</li>
    <li> We all need direction in life. Sometimes what puts us on the right path is being in the right situation at the right time. BUT always being ready for that situation is of utmost important. With that, I bring you &#x27;Eau My&#x27; cologne! It&#x27;s the icing on the cake for that all important date, anniversary, business meeting or just sharing some Martini&#x27;s and acting rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to trust which Cologne brand is the right one these days. But when I found out that the person in charge of making sure the Enterprise was always on course, George Takei, had made his own Cologne, I knew this was a safe bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Cologne&#x27;s start out a bit harsh and some are practically unnoticeable. I have a long history of doing the old &#x27;double spray&#x27; with the unnoticeable ones only to later find out, one would have been enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Cologne is safe from leaning too far to the left or right. The scent is perfect for both casual nights and those fancy ones where you want to impress that special person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should have a collection of excellent Cologne&#x27;s in their arsenal. And I am proud to count this cologne as part of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boldly go where your scent hasn&#x27;t gone before! Okay, I&#x27;m done with the bad Star Trek jokes. Just buy a few bottles before they run out!</li>
    <li> Having read the many glowing reviews of George Takei&#x27;s Eau My on Amazon, I eagerly ordered a bottle, placed a chair by the front door, made myself comfortable, and sat in keen anticipation of the duly ordered packaging making first contact with my doormat. Well, the seconds, minutes, hours and then days (okay, day, obviously I invested in express delivery for such a desirable olfactory artefact) dragged past with such mind-numbing slowness that I thought I may have inadvertently placed my chair in a temporal wake, but eventually, as my anticipation was reaching the sort of fevered pitch usually reserved for Klingon mating rituals, the letterbox swung open and a handful of bills scattered onto my doormat. Oh the humanity. Then, a few seconds later, the letterbox swung open again, in my eyes with all the glory of the Gamma Quadrant wormhole, and an unassuming brown cardboard box in regulation Amazon livery passed through looking every inch as majestic as the Defiant returning from a mission, performing a perfect landing on my hallway floor. Mr Postman, you TEASE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I leapt from my seat, snatched up the package, tore it open with equal parts frenzied eagerness and loving affection, took the treasured bottle in my shaking hand, and without a second further ado, I sprayed the contents all over myself. I stood for several seconds, eyes closed, inhaling deeply with satisfaction, when I suddenly realised that something was wrong. Looking down at the bottle, I saw to my initial horror that Amazon (\\&quot;curse them\\&quot;, I said, \\&quot;and their descendants for five next generations\\&quot;!) had sent me in error a bottle of William Shatner&#x27;s &#x60;Ostentation&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was horrified, but I quickly started to like the masculine aroma of Shatner and have since become totally addicted, never looking back. Since that initial spray I have been, in the words of my loved ones, &#x60;a little over-dramatic&#x27;, while my colleagues reckon I have become difficult to work with. Pah!On the flip side though, my self-esteem has shot though the roof, and I have never had so much female action in my life, including my first interracial kiss and strangely, one woman who was blue (and no, she wasn&#x27;t cold - she was HOT!). My speech patterns have become a little odd, which I think contributes to the so-called over-dramatic-ness but I can live with that. To sum up, forget Takei, get Shatner&#x27;s &#x27;Ostentation&#x27; - it will boldly change your life and take you places you have never gone before (possibly blue ones).</li>
    <li> Eau My is a scent so captivating and distinctive that Scotty won&#x27;t need coordinates to beam you back to the ship.</li>
    <li> The sweet smell of success. Buy this and you will double your number of Facebook friends! Oh my indeed. Beam me up to high fashion.</li>
    <li> Sadly, it did not have the &amp;#34;top notes&amp;#34; as promised. There are no mandarin zest or bergamot overtones. My daughter said it smells like high school....it&#x27;s not &#x27;woodsie&amp;#34; at all, but it finishes fresh like Febreze. If you&#x27;re looking for a signature fragrance, one that defines you, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This cologne spray is my favorite Christmas presents. Friday after Christmas I put it on me and went to the club to see the reaction on people. I have to say that George Takei&#x27;s Eau My will beam you up to a trek were not only females, but males as well, will boldly go were no one has gone before with you.</li>
    <li> A really refreshing fragrance. I ordered it for fun, but it&#x27;s turned out to be useful.</li>
    <li> The cologne itself is very light and extremely pleasant. Giving it to a Star Trek Fan was great fun. Quality product... Quality gift!</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and my husband like to wear Uncle George&#x27;s amazing scent.  So glad to have the fresh, enticing scent of Eau Myyyy in my home. Thank you!</li>
    <li> i once met george takai and made it a habit of sniffing him the whole time. one restraining order later, i wondered if it was possible to bottle sulu in a bottle. so naturally, i got a giant bottle, violated the restraining order, and tried to shove him in there. it didn&#x27;t go well and police were called as was into question my &amp;#34;mental state&amp;#34;. my cellmate gave this to me for my birthday and it smells  just like him!!! i recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> While wandering through infinite fandoms, I came across a vial of this in one of the fields of trenzalore. After applying this to my neck, I was instantly surrounded by griffindors and jedi all willing to head to battle against Klingons and the ringwraiths. After much debate I put on my invisibility cloak, scanned the wooden door with my sonic screwdriver, and took a podracer to narnia. There the scarecrow brought me to see Sherlock, where we had a great debate with Sheldon Cooper and Dr. House until the white rabbit came along.</li>
    <li> When you wear this, two things are guaranteed: it will start raining your preferred gender, and two, no one will ever call you tiny again. Take that, Starfleet security.</li>
    <li> The perfect accessory for my son-in-law. It will go perfectly with his Captain Kirk bathrobe or when he slips into a parallel universe where all Cybermen have been devolved into cufflinks that he wears to court when he wants to show just how invincible he is.</li>
    <li> Where is my Starfleet uniform? Why am I wearing only a sheer sparkly mesh gown with sequins and beads covering my bosom? And who are all these men who trail me, zombie-like, as though trapped in a cloud of my hypnotic fragrance, Eau My!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I remember was beaming off the Holodeck...</li>
    <li> So I sprayed this on myself and went out last night. Not knowing the powers it bestowed upon me, a man approached me soon as I got to downtown asking to go where no man has ever gone before. I looked for #1 for help before reluctantly saying &#x27;engage&#x27;, only to have #2 show up abruptly and save the day!</li>
    <li> When I first received the package It was like a stork magically flew to my doorstep with a beautiful package which would change my life forever. I opened the box and saw this magnificent blue bottle. I saw my reflection through the chrome top which made my experience that much better. As I slowly unwraped the package I could not help myself from thinking of all the women who would just melt when they gave me a hug. The moment came... I sprayed just a little bit of this amazing goodness on my neck and then it was like an angel came down from heaven and kissed me. Then the aroma came. Now... There are some aromas out there that give you all sorts of feelings but when I smelled this one it made me have a premature orgasm in my pants. The only thing I can compare the feeling to is when you eat too much sugar and your body gets all warm and fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a night of craziness at the club, I have realized that this wasn&#x27;t really cologne but yet some sort of love potion. As I came into the club all the women started to twerk. It was as if as the aroma turned me into a chick magnet or something . It was a night to remember for sure and it was all due to this miracle fragrance. I hope everyone can experience the same types of orgasms I felt while using this product and share their review here. Amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;Brian</li>
    <li> Eau My perfectly complements my Wolf Sweatshirt. Pair it with a miniskirt and some go-go boots and you will basically drown in pussy (or whatever synechdoche you choose to objectify people you&#x27;d like to spend some holodeck time with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, however, I would caution moderation: four pumps or more will in fact release a terrifying array of pheromones leading to a spate of psychosexual hallucinations that quickly descend into violent, Reaver-like orgies of dismemberment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, in space, no one can hear you eat your own face off.</li>
    <li> I stared at the bottle, the light of an oil lantern shining off the sensual curves of its design, glistening from the humble luminescence like Excalibur as it rose from those mystical, deep waters for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single drop of sweat coalesced on my brow and fell away, as if time were scarcely passing at all. My hands shook, as a child&#x27;s, upon the morn of their first snowfall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was alone, deep in the woods. I feared the repercussions of the decision I knew I had already made, without understanding why. I decided to pick up the mysterious potion who&#x27;s power, enigmatic though it was, could be felt the moment I encountered it&#x27;s vessel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lifting the cap to my nose, I curiously sniffed the exterior, like a doe testing the air for predators. That was my last clear memory for the next twenty four hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recall bits and pieces, a moment at a casino, women laughing, men laughing. I remember hands and hair, equally soft as they caressed my skin. Laughter, passion, sweat. I remember flowers, an open field. True love. I cannot say for certain what was real or imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For certain though, I awoke the following day, back inside my tent in the deep woods. Songbirds chirped cheerily between the sunbeams that danced through the leafy boughs, swaying calmly about the wooded grove which cradled my encampment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only clue which remained with me, that any of it was real was the crumpled napkin that remained in the palm of my hand. Inscribed upon it, as if from the lips, or lipstick of providence, was the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this night, you were alive. -G.T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation, this product provides a satisfactory experience at a reasonable price. I cannot guarantee that you too will find true love or meet any celebrities, but I can assure you will feel a truer sense of inner peace than I have ever known before.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this cologne except now William Shatner keeps coming over for breakfast and staying for dinner every night.  I had no idea that the cologne came with William Shatner.</li>
    <li> Eau My - the cologne to bring any scaredy cat out of their shell. I sprayed a little cologne and the (once) Cowardly Lion came strutting with confidence and pep.. Followed by the other animals in Oz. Just a few lions, tigers, and bears, thanks Eau My!</li>
    <li> I perchased this as a gift for my husband expecting for it to cover the smell if taco meat and redbull but what i discovered is that this product has a psychological effect as I experienced a new found love of smooth jazz and my husband not only showered But also discovered the joy of mani-pedi&#x27;s and hair products as well as developing a fondness the fine arts. Now my refined man is being approached on the streets, we hardly ever pay for meals yourself as people are more than willing to give him anything, he has developed an investment portfolio,  and there is talk over making him mayor. All of this has done wonders for our sex life and we cant keep our hands off eachother</li>
    <li> A great present for those you know who smell like the captain&#x27;s log. Might we expect additional Eau My cosmetics from the GT range soon? This reviewer demands a GT product for those who suffer from phaser burn: \\&quot;BALM!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> To me Eau My has the essential odor of a freshly cleaned catbox. My cat thought so as well because she just pee&#x27;d on my shirt which was in the laundry basket.</li>
    <li> WARNING!: When putting on this cologne may result in randomization of &amp;#34;OH MY....!&amp;#34; throughout the course of the evening. When on dates, please be advised to only one spritz per day.  Severe internal Injuries will result when trying to hold in the &amp;#34;OH MY...!&amp;#34;s. Others have experience the &amp;#34;VOICE OVER&amp;#34; option when witnessing a Japanese Film. Seek professional help when this occurs, or just keep putting it on. ITS AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Helping humans breed with aliens since 2013 or just the occasional anal probe quickie. Either way its a win win.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to say i love it but I&#x27;ve never smelled it! i need a sample! this sister need a sample oh my!!!! i mean Eau My.</li>
    <li> Weather fighting Romulans, Khan or significant other it is a great fragrance for  all. I bought this for one of &amp;#34;Star Treks&amp;#34; biggest fans, my son the guru of Star Trek trivia, although it never made it that far. I fell in love with it. I let him use it every once in a while for those special dates. It&#x27;s sexy, masculine, and feminine all at once and seems to capture the personality of each individual. Great job George.</li>
    <li> Yes, I was the fifth man on the away team before I spritzed on Eau My....needless to say, I survived.</li>
    <li> When I think of a firm hard wrestle from 20 years ago, I think Eu My!!  No one wrestles like Brad!!!</li>
    <li> Tentative was I to try Eau My from George Takei&#x27;s fragrance collection.  After all, for forty dollars, the commitment is real.  And what business do I have, a straight man wearing a gay man&#x27;s cologne?  However, I decided to throw caution into the wind and BOLDLY sally forth into the unknown world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my shaking hands clumsily opened the package to my newest scent, what I discovered beneath the wrapping paper was a 1.7 ounce bottle of pure glory!  I quickly sprayed some of that delectable scent upon my body (not too much, I didn&#x27;t want to smell like a floozy) primped my hair and strode forth into the wild world, to seek out new life, new experiences!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what did befall me was completely outstanding; picture if you will a boy, newly turned into a man pushing a cart in the supermarket when my eyes met a pretty lass.  When her eyes met mine I knew she was done for, I strode close to her, knowing in my heart that the pheromones that I was currently dripping with would indeed swoon her heart, and that was when I was met with success; she gave me a smile!  Truly, it was a slightly uncomfortable smile, awkward at best, but wouldn&#x27;t you be if you were suddenly awash with the finest scent you would ever smell in your life?  Truly, I was doing her a favor.  THIS is what it would be like to be a starfleet officer, having women crawling all over you.  THIS is what it was like to know that nobody could ever resist your charms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave her the nod and checked out, my heart racing with all the thoughts that this sheer power could do to a man.  Oh, she&#x27;ll be back, and when she is I will be waiting to make my move.  Thank you George Takei for unleashing the primal within me, for now I shall truly be great!</li>
    <li> Have you ever wanted to make someone faint after they walked by you? Well this product is going to make anyobe feel like they&#x27;ve been pulled in by a tractor beam when they smell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why waste time with conversation when you can literally make someone faint. You&#x27;ll be saying \\&quot;oh my\\&quot; with how fast your communicator database fills up. You&#x27;ll be begging for less while the world begs for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make any man or woman&#x27;s tricorder go off when they catch a whiff of this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: don&#x27;t hold them responsible when your teleporter breaks from all the action being directed to your deck.</li>
    <li> I WISH I WAS LYING. (&amp;#34;GOD:30 EARLY&amp;#34;) THIS MORNING WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS GETTING READY FOR WORK HE PUT ON EAU MY AND IT WOKE ME FROM A DEAD SLEEP. A. DEAD. SLEEP. AND I LOVE SLEEPING. I sat up, sniffing the air, looking for my husband, blistery eyed, with my sleepy mask pushed up onto my forehead. My husband has never really worn a cologne before and once I found out that Uncle George&#x27;s Eau My was a REAL COLOGNE I ordered it for him immediately. I hope that this scent is always in production- if ever there comes a time when it may be discontinued or whatever else, I will be purchasing this in bulk. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.</li>
    <li> I drank it all!  It was truly amazing, and now I swear I can see better in the dark and my wife is 47% more attracted to me, but I didn&#x27;t know it was a cologne type thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to get more… but no promises that I won&#x27;t drink it again.</li>
    <li> This cologne made me feel like more of a man. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good or bad considering I&amp;#34;m a woman.</li>
    <li> Eau My is giving, tender but not whimpy.  It won&#x27;t make you sleep in the wet spot, and will answer when you call the next day! What a find guys!</li>
    <li> Only a red shirt would wear something else! Dont be a red shirt! Engage all the hawties just like Sulu with this wonderful fragrance!</li>
    <li> This is the only fragrance my son will wear, the only one that effectively masks the odor of an 18-year old boy without overpowering everyone in the room.  People smile and say &amp;#34;Eau My!&amp;#34; when he passes their way instead of pinching their noses and exclaiming &amp;#34;Pee-you!&amp;#34; Worth every penny and then some.  Besides, George Takei is so cool.</li>
    <li> Eau My is the scent for all GENERATIONS.&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are a young virgin looking to find THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY.&lt;br /&gt;Or a seasoned senior facing THE FINAL FRONTIER.&lt;br /&gt;Are you looking for Mister Goodbar, or in THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK?&lt;br /&gt;Eau My is the answer.&lt;br /&gt;Eau My is great for FIRST CONTACT, and lasts long after THE VOYAGE HOME.&lt;br /&gt;So foil your NEMESIS, and prevent INSURRECTION from your conquests.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase Eau My now, and avoid THE WRATH OF KHAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And look for our newest fragrance coming out next summer - Eau No You Didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have worn many different scents in my life, but they were mere toilet water compared to Eau Myyy!&lt;br /&gt;After I put it on, and went out, I got many compliments FROM GIRLS!!  I enjoyed the fruity scent, and the extra attention!&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I put on my Three Wolves T-Shirt that things got crazy!&lt;br /&gt;I remember little of what happened the rest of the night.  Just vague flashes of women in short skirts, and men in red shirts.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part was that my butt was sore for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;I give Eau My 4 stars.  Would be 5 if I could remember more of that night.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t Italian for anything. I have no idea what it means. Near as I can tell it&#x27;s a Japanese-American phrase that expresses excitement or surprise. I dunno a bunch of nerds stole itboff some Asian guy in outer space.</li>
    <li> With just one spray of Eau My, you will be &amp;#34;transported&amp;#34; with ecstasy, along with everyone around you! If you are out clubbing and looking for a date, it will be shields down as soon as they get a whiff of you, if you know what I mean. Just don&#x27;t be too alarmed if a weird looking woman follows you around saying &amp;#34;I am for YOU.&amp;#34; She is probably just the clingy type, so be kind and don&#x27;t rub salt in the wound. On second thought, throw her an entire bag of salt and run like hell!</li>
    <li> This stench can only be found naturally in the bellies of beast that are fed a diet of dead orcs and the feces of the dragon smaug. I wonder what would happen if you sprayed this on a Klingon...I&#x27;ll have to assume all the stage-5 klingers will magically poof into the same room and begin beating each other senselessly in hopes of being the first to get a touch and a taste.</li>
    <li> This is the first cologne that my whole family thinks fits me. I love it. Wish I could buy this in multi-packs.</li>
    <li> These reviews are so clever, I cannot compete. I have to hope to be the one selected at random. Thank-you for the laughs (almost) all you other reviewers! The silver bottle with the light blue cologne is very attractive and the name is great too.</li>
    <li> Great scent and not to expensive, I recommend it to any nerd who cares about how they smell! yay everyone!</li>
    <li> I may be one of the few people here who will be writing a serious review of the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore George Takei. Followed him on FB for a few years now. Always say in a grave tone of voice,\\&quot; It&#x27;s okay to be Takei\\&quot; to nay sayers and homophobes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this perfume as a Christmas gift, because of the aforementioned love of GT. I was properly tickled and delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t get behind this perfume (or in front, or to either side of). It smells distinctly like a masculine perfume, more musky than anything else. There&#x27;s a vague honeysuckle scent after the cologne has been settled a while. The perfume actually stained the wrist portion of my blouse (discovered when washing). My roommate, several day later, upon seeing the scent on my bureau, tried some on, and then broke into a rash. She hasn&#x27;t had a reaction to anything like this before, but she&#x27;s also not a huge scentsy person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the scent on my guy, just not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not terrible, it&#x27;s just not for me. I will be keeping it on the far flung galactic chance that I get to meet GT one day, treat him and Brad to brunch, and ask him to autograph it.</li>
    <li> Probably like a lot of people, I bought this as a bit of a gag gift but turned out to be impressed with it as a perfectly respectable cologne. It definitely is one that gets better (for me) once the initial fragrances wear down a bit and the earthier stuff lingers.</li>
    <li> Warp factor ludicrous captain! Once applied you feel the universe flowing past every lightly sprayed inch of skin like a vision of hyperspace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how hard it was to stop screaming &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; in a husky voice, I felt like I was energized with dilithium crystals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Mr Takei I now know what space feels like, pressing against my skin as I float in a space suit made of &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34;! Come float with me!</li>
    <li> I spritzed a small amount on my husband, and he immediately tore off his shirt, grabbed an épée, and took off downstairs to fight an alien intruder. Who happened to be our neighbor. Anyway, turns out Eau My is good for covering up carnage odors, too. It smells so much better than the DeForest Pine cologne we tried, not to mention the Doohan Sanitizer.</li>
    <li> Ordered as a gift but had to try it before I wrapped it up. I love it. A terrific light scent. I think the bottle is classic and stylish. Will look great on the bureau or dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is also ok to take on airplanes. And Bonus - manufactured in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - no Tribbles were harmed in the testing of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eau YES! Keeper!</li>
    <li> It seems illogical that a scent could arouse the pheromones of any species. Nevertheless Mr. Sulu seems to have made the leap! Whether you&#x27;re fighting of tribbles, Klingons, or drunken Shatners, Eau My attracts all sort of beasts. Go where no man has gone before…or maybe he has! Enjoy, I know it beamed me up!</li>
    <li> Prior to getting upset, &amp;#34;Geh&amp;#34; is the abbreviation when citing a botanical name, and botany often being the source of such fragrance research.</li>
    <li> I splashed on Eau My while browsing the department store one day and wow, I boldly smelled like no man has before. Then feeling all \\&quot;Takei&#x27;d\\&quot; the urge to explore new worlds over took me. I decided to first boldly go where no man has gone before, but was asked quite sternly by mall security to, \\&quot;get out of the Ladies Room\\&quot;. and leave the mall immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I left my purchase behind in my rush. So here I am, now ordering online, I&#x27;m due back in court Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, the mall security is Klingon.</li>
    <li> Delicious and provocative, but never overwhelming, this clean fragrance makes me feel sexy and attractive.  Better yet, it seems to inspire my lover and I to new heights of...Oh Myy!</li>
    <li> I hope I win a free bottle.  I am dying to approach woman and tell them &amp;#34;I smell like Captain Sulu&amp;#34;  I am sure I will score.</li>
    <li> This Cologne is fabulous. Need to spice up your love life? Eau My. Need to express that it&#x27;s okay to be Takei? Eau My.  Want to cleverly say \\&quot;oh myyyyy\\&quot; without spelling it out? Eau My.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will this cologne make you as cool as George Takei? Absolutely not. Eau well.</li>
    <li> With Eau my, women will \\&quot;klingon\\&quot; you at warp speed!! True story!&lt;br /&gt;Plus if you dont buy it now, this guy is going to show up at your door!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> All I can say is that this scent gives you the confidence to boldly go where Noam ( or woman) has gone before. The Prime Directive may be compromised however as you may not be able to limit interference you may encounter from alien produce cultures. Well done, Takei...ohmyyyy</li>
    <li> Several cycles ago, a sample of this &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; cologne spray was delivered to my home, planet Vulcan, wherein I applied a ration of the substance to my naturally odorous body.  The illogical actions of my fellow Vulcans upon sensing the substance were unpredictable; the majority of persons with whom I interacted on that day appeared to be intent on bedding me, regardless of any utilitarian calculations prescribing otherwise.  The substance appears to invoke passions in Vulcans similar to those instantiated in mating humans.  The integrity of proper inductive reasoning dictates that this experiment is continued with a renewed supply of Eau My cologne spray.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and his Facebook posts are now 100% funnier than they used to be! Bad sense of humor no longer embarrasses me in front of all my FB friends!</li>
    <li> Now you too can have that &amp;#34;Fresh from a Convention&amp;#34; smell!  No longer do you have to rub elbows with Cosplayers that have been steeped in their own sweat.  Avoid embarrassing conversations with overly enthusiastic fans, and buy the cologne that says, &amp;#34;Geek&amp;#34; without the &amp;#34;Reek!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Just got a wiff of this and I can conclude with a shadow of a doubt that it smells like happy and a hint of rainbows.</li>
    <li> One small squirt (or a few large ones, if you prefer) and whatever your orientation, you will be beating them off with a stick (or a vibrating device sold for entertainment purposes only).  In fact, you know how Amazon.com packages things that are frequently purchased simultaneously?  I have it on good authority that soon we will be able to purchase this fine spray along with a package of condoms and lubricant.  Set phasers to sexy!  Ohhhhhh myyyyy!</li>
    <li> Eau Myyyy, this delicious scent will sure make me popular on Planet Hotness!  Beam me down, Scottie, and don&#x27;t wait up!</li>
    <li> What can one say about this scent that has not already been said. This scent turns mice into men, and men into gods. One sniff of this and your significant other will need a towel as his or her desire is aroused to such heights as to make the moon seem beneath them. One cannot walk down the street without an impromptu entourage lapping at your heels. Money will literally fall from the skies in heaven&#x27;s effort to garner even a fraction of your attention. The power that exudes from your pores after a few spritzes of this mojo in a bottle is not for the faint of heart. You may fall in love with yourself Adonis. Well don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t try to warn you. Eau My, indeed.</li>
    <li> You will love this fragrance! As any Buddhist Boy Scout will tell you, there is a true path to enlightenment here. Splash a bit of this on and suddenly you&#x27;ll find Nirvana, true peace and contentment, and you&#x27;ll be helping old ladies across the street as well!  You can&#x27;t get a better foothold in your spiritual and olfactory development than Eau My. One whiff of you and the world will settle down and behave.</li>
    <li> Had trouble with my tribbles.  While I didn&#x27;t mind them multiplying, the litter box effect took me by surprise.  But I guess it shouldn&#x27;t have been a surprise.  In any event, we were out of Febreeze and the only thing I could find was Eau My.  And let me tell you this.  Eau. My. Gawd.  It made the apartment smell like the antiseptic bridge.  I will never leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Who knew that smelling like a Japanese gay man would change my life?  Right after the first spray, things turned upside down.  The wind changed direction, cats and dogs started dancing together in the streets, Yankee fans were seen hugging Redsox fans and Miley Cyrus put ON some clothes!  I gained thousands of Twitter followers and Facebook friends by the minute!  People started asking me about William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy!  Everyone wanted my opinion on gay marriage, show tunes, Star Trek vs Star Wars, what makes a great meme and the Twilight series!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I could say after that five minutes was Eau My goodness!  This is a must purchase!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t settle for replicated Synthaeau-My, only the genuine article will live up to the much anticipated hype. Set course for fun, engage at warp myine.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother, he is a &amp;#34;happy man&amp;#34;.  He has now informed me that since wearing this cologne, he can&#x27;t keep the boys off him.  He even put milkshakes in his neighbors yard, but they keep coming to his!  He has gotten marriage proposals from both men and women.  He is still reviewing all of the proposals to see which one is in his best interest.  I highly recommend this cologne for the &amp;#34;happy man&amp;#34; in your life, it makes a wonderful gift that keeps on giving!</li>
    <li> Do you remember Ice Nine, invented by Kurt Vonnegut in his novel, Cat&#x27;s Cradle?  Well, this delightful fragrance is the sensual and romantic equivalent.  It is refreshing, cool, passionate and dangerous.  While it isn&#x27;t a polymorphic liquid, it will change the lovely people around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Takei may have conquered the internet, and he definitely pwns the haters.  Now, he does for designer fragrances what he did for Galactic relations.  Remember, this man saved Kirk several times, became an admiral, and (according to Shatner&#x27;s novels) was elected as President of the Federation for an unprecedented three terms.  President Obama wishes he could do so well.  Do you really believe that he did all that without help?  No, my trekkers.  He had the assistance of Eau My, a heaven-sent heavenly scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally , we have a cologne spray fit for Hikaru Sulu.  Unleash the inner D&#x27;Artagnan in you.  You too will exclaim, &amp;#34;Oh Myyy!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I gave this to my boyfriend as an early Christmas present. I must say, strange things started happening afterwards...&lt;br /&gt;We were at home, and suddenly I noticed a strange smell, so I followed it all the way to the kitchen, and there was my boyfriend, washing the dishes. Oh, my! I thought he was trying to make it right because he missed the toilet at night again. The next day, I felt that strange smell again, and followed it to the living room. My boyfriend was vacuum cleaning. Oh, my. That&#x27;s when I knew something was fishy. The day after, I was home alone, and immediately after I felt that strange smell again, someone rang at the door. It was my boyfriend, holding a huge bouquet of red roses. Oh, my! \\&quot;He&#x27;s definitely cheating on me\\&quot;, I thought. He even gave me a massage later that night. And you know what? I DON&#x27;T CARE! I&#x27;m going to buy him another one, and hope that it will also make his penis bigger.</li>
    <li> I might spend a quatloo to see if this product would get an Orion female to lower her shields, but $40?</li>
    <li> This cologne completely changed my life, no seriously! One spray of this cologne and I had the courage to ask my black life partner to marry me in front of a crowd of Republicans. We then proceeded to tie the knot in front of some lovely men in white dresses whilst  in Alabama. Now, all I have to do is tell my wife that I married a black man... time for more cologne!</li>
    <li> I like to go into crowded malls and spray a mist on random people and then wait for the fun to begin! One of my &amp;#34;victims&amp;#34; actually had his clothes ripped off by several amorous shoppers of both sexes.  I am no longer allowed in the area mall.</li>
    <li> Upon first receiving Eau My by George Takei I was pleasantly surprised. Mainly because I&#x27;ve never tried a unisex fragrance before. I thought I may be saying Eau No about my purchase but that was definitely not the case. I took a big wiff and it wasn&#x27;t too girly (like i was expecting), nor too masculine. Gave it another sniff, threw some on, and ran out the door. After a few minutes I noticed an immediate reaction. As I walked down the street I was really turning heads. Girls all over the place were smiling and waving. The weird thing was that every person uttered a small \\&quot;Oh My\\&quot; as I went by. I&#x27;m amazed how strong the smell was considering there were a few girls pointing me out from in a car across the street. I even got a few winks and chuckles from a couple of guys too. By the time I reached the store I had everyones attention, they couldn&#x27;t get enough of me. Camera phones were out, a crowd was forming. By the time I finished getting my things my confidence was through the roof. I was in love with this unbelievable fragrance, and apparently so was everyone else. When I got to the register I realized I forgot something back at the house... my pants. Needless to say I went back home and grabbed my wallet, figured I might as well get another good spray of Eua My while I was there. I knocked over the giant purple dragon on my way out the door and headed back to the store. Now even the birds and squirrels were giving me an \\&quot;Oh Myy\\&quot;. I worked up another crowd, proceeded to get my things, checked out with the orangutan at the register, and headed home. This stuff was incredible! I&#x27;ve just had this fragrance for a day and I can&#x27;t get enough of it. A few dancing fairies were telling me it was a bit much, but what do they know. 5 Excellent Stars!! Go from \\&quot;Oh no!\\&quot; to \\&quot;Oh Myyy\\&quot; in just one spray.</li>
    <li> The perfect present for any Trek Fan, the bottle is classic in appearance , and the scent crisp yet alluring, plus there is nothing quite like the feeling of George Takei spraying across your chest and neck first thing in the morning, the best way to start your day!!</li>
    <li> On a whim, my husband decided to wear this with his favorite red shirt, but he spontaneously combusted as soon as the cologne came into contact. I can not recommend!!</li>
    <li> While reading one of my favorite magazines, I noticed a cologne sample sticking right out at me, taunting me to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Staring at the initials glaring back at me...GT..GT.. but what does GT stand for? Grand Tourismo? No. Georgia Tech? Grand Times? Ahh..I feel I am getting closer. Gay Times? Ooo My, I finally had it! George Takei~ Eau My is right. The times are finally changing.  Get yours today at Warp Speed.</li>
    <li> What happened to me, like so many men, is that I forgot something.  Some important date: a birthday, an anniversary, valentines, something my wife would be counting down while her husband(who&#x27;s lucky to guess his own birthday without checking his ID) goes blissfully unaware.&lt;br /&gt;I only realized this after meeting her icy stare in the window.  I immediately went through the five stages of forgetting such things: &amp;#34;she&#x27;ll understand&amp;#34;, panic, regret, considering just running, and trying to make last minute reservations.  I straightened my tie and got out my secret(and now I realize ultimate) weapon, my bottle of &amp;#34;Eau My 1.7-oz Cologne Spray&amp;#34; from the glove compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got to the door my wife was waiting for me, but to my surprise whatever lecture she had been laying out seemed to fade away into a warm smile as the wind shifted.  Not wanting to rely on this shift of fate for too long, I lied about successfully making a reservation, thinking I could later make it out to be a clerical error when the host revealed no such reservation had been made.  To my surprise again, I not only noticed that being upwind of the host caused him to find it &amp;#34;too great a shame to leave such a lovely couple without a nice evening&amp;#34; but also that some force about me was generating a warm summer breeze, essentially making upwind of everyone.&lt;br /&gt;During our meal, the string quartet moved right next to our table, claiming the atmosphere was much better there, a man gave me his card saying I&#x27;d &amp;#34;be perfect for some film work,&amp;#34; and the owner dropped by, confusing me for one of his son&#x27;s friends and giving us the meal on the house along with a very nice bottle of wine.  Later on the summer breeze began carrying flower petals through the air and a very well behaved llama showed up to join us for dessert(my wife&#x27;s favorite animal).  The same llama ate my neighbors tulips and brought me my paper the next morning.  All in all, a perfect romantic outing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to realize what event I had missed and have little intention to try.  Thank you George Takei, without whatever daring fragrances and eldritch magicks you put in this amazing cologne, I&#x27;d surely be sleeping on the couch until the great old one, Cthulhu, rose from the sea to destroy the coastal cities and invoke chaos and destruction upon this world.  Am I right, fellas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, you may experience seeing George Takei&#x27;s face smiling and occasionally winking at you in every screen you see while the cologne remains potent.  I see no downside to this and this is not a warning, just something I thought I should add.</li>
    <li> This &#x27;dual action&#x27; parfume&#x27; (as they say in France) was amazing.  Sweet smelling armpits, and even sweeter sphincter.  Thank you George!</li>
    <li> At only 1.7 ounces, it proves size does not matter. One spritz of this daily, and no matter if you wear a blue, yellow, or red shirt, it is coming off! Eau My!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon wearing this mist of Takei, I immediately was captured by several species of humanoids and taken out for an elaborate mating ritual. No recordings were allowed, but the activities of this primitive species were stimulated by the fragrance. I felt as if I was with a dozen Orions for a weekend, and it was only 6 standard hours. Use with discretion. Refer to Starfleet Regulations regarding interspecies contact.</li>
    <li> While there is no guarantee that a spray of Eau My will make you strip off your shirt and charge your co-workers with an epee, there is also no guarantee that it won&#x27;t. People who have never had fencing lessons, who are not nudists, and whose normal demeanor is calm should apply that first spray with discretion. Unless of course you have always dreamed of being the D&#x27;Artagnan of the 23rd century. In that case, spray away and have at it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will smell terrific, whatever happens.</li>
    <li> While you&#x27;re wand&#x27;ring in star flight, what better way to win over the man/woman/alien of your dreams?  Eau My is not just a cologne, but also the equivilant of setting your phaser to &amp;#34;stunning&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t teleport without it!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping the use it all but before I got the first spray on George Takei&#x27;d it away!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for our 27th anniversary, as I wanted him to smell like a man for once in his life.  All I can say is, Eau Myyyy!  He has become so sensitive, hanging on my every word, helping me pick out the perfect outfit for every occasion.  And while the night sweats are a bit much, his facial hair is starting to come in so nicely for the first time in his life.  We are so happy with the results and cannot WAIT for the release of the new product from Mr. Takei&#x27;s line, &amp;#34;Eau My Lourde&amp;#34;.  It sure is okay to be Takei!</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like George Takei&#x27;s taint like I did, this is not the scent for you. Unfortunately, it smells delightful.</li>
    <li> I bought this out of curiosity; not expecting a heck of a lot, and I was not disappointed.  Eau My has an odd shifting smell as it wears on the first few hours; but, it is not one of those colognes that you can smell all day.  Then scent wears off rapidly seldom lasting more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my book (and on my cologne shelf), it is a one timer ... sorry George.</li>
    <li> I had to look up &amp;#34;vetiver&amp;#34; on Wikipedia to find out what that was, though I was instantly sold on the rest of the description, but then I found it and understood Takei&#x27;s choice of descriptor was eau so apt.... among the explanation, I found that &amp;#34;The plant stems are erect and stiff&amp;#34;....  well need I say more??  I think I will anyway....  Eau myyy.....</li>
    <li> Not sure what some of these complaints are about. As a woman, I found this cologne not only made me feel witty and sassy, but it immediately improved my fencing skills. If I keep this up, I&#x27;ll be a pro fencing contender in no time at all... if I can manage to keep my shirt on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;Had to remove a star due to police harassment over my impromptu toplessness. What&#x27;s up with the gender discrimination?!</li>
    <li> AKA Tribble sweat: 60% of the time it works every time! Let&#x27;s go see if we can make tribble purr.</li>
    <li> My husband and I were in a bit of a drought, so I figured the best way to end the drought would be to spice it up somehow.  After many different attempts with many different tactics (Pheromones, Whips, Chains, Etc) I finally found the Eau My Cologne.  I must say that I looked in the mirror while spraying myself, and I found myself more attractive with each spray.  I just knew he would be all over me.  When he got home, I was in a very seductive pose, and he looked at me and said &amp;#34;Eau Myyyy, you might want to leave.  My husband will be back any moment.&amp;#34;  I thought he was joking around, but apparently this stuff is so powerful, it changes the way you look.  I guess it was not just my imagination after all.  That night ended pretty well, needless to say, though I am a little upset with my husband for cheating on me with me...</li>
    <li> For the first time in my life I can be confident whilst sauntering pleasantly through the streets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Eau My 1.7-oz Cologne Spray, I had a hard time making nice with passersby, stopping to smell the flowers, and finding members of my own gender attractive. But no more! Today I stand as a beacon of such niceties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Eau My 1.7-oz Cologne Spray, you could have called me a vagrant, a lost soul, a bum who smells like cheese. But no more! Today you can call me a snappy dresser, a people person, a sarcastic jackass, and just about anything else you can think of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay to be skeptical. I know I was when I saw my first bottle. \\&quot;How can this make me as awesome as Mister Takei?\\&quot;, I thought, \\&quot;Will I really be an adored public figure who makes Hillary Clinton look like the late (and missed) Chris Farley in the realm of Sophistication?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is, \\&quot;Yes,\\&quot; my friends.&lt;br /&gt;The secret is to apply the product from head to toe (preferably applied by bathing in it), allowing the magic infused in the bottle by the power of puns to metamorphosize your obviously tragic odor with something a little more Takei. I&#x27;ve gone three days using regular applications versus three days using this little secret to see the difference. During the three days of regular application, I was noticed by members of both sexes, bought drinks at all three establishments I visited, and offered a role on American Idol as a judge. These three days were great and all, but after bathing in Eau My 1.7-oz Cologne Spray for three days, I was beamed up by Scotty, assisted by my own fleet in destroying an alien warplanet, and worshipped as a God on several smaller planets and in the southern US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give Eau My 1.7-oz Cologne Spray a six star rating if I could (but not 7, that would be a bit much). This bottle changed my fictitious life and taught me that it is okay to be Takei.</li>
    <li> This is one terrific product. It is so smelly good and it tastes good too. My wife couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off me and nibbled my ear right off! I had to try it for myself. It really does make anything smell AND taste so good. Spray it on your salad greens to keep them fresh tasting  and smelly good. Put a few sprays on your bread for that extra zing. And when you are all done making dinner, spray some on yourself and YOU could be dessert, rawr!</li>
    <li> Set you senses afire with the heat of &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34;!  Your mouth will water at the thought of your man wearing the fragrance of George Takei&#x27;s creation.  The gentle caress... the raw Power!!!  Takei love to a new level...  Wear &amp;#34;Eau My!&amp;#34;. Warp Factor 10, Sulu!!!!</li>
    <li> Simply put, Eau My is to elegance as the Wilderness XT tires were to the Ford Explorer. For the business traveler try Eau My Tai (in plaid, striped or Jerry Garcia scent).</li>
    <li> Made from the sweat squeegeed off Sulu&#x27;s hot body in the aptly named Star Trek episode, &amp;#34;The Naked Time,&amp;#34; Eau My will invigorate you from the moment you open the bottle. Wide-eyed and bushy tailed would be quite the understatement. Will it make you the master of the foil? No, but you will have the confidence to try. The aroma can deter Gojira, Mothra and Rodan at a thousand paces, yet attract shirtless Samurai five kilometers away. Samurai in full dress must be closer for Eau My to affect them.</li>
    <li> I came across this sensational treasure in an era of copies and predictable essences. This fragrance has come to take over and Beam me Up into the skies of exuberance and...Oh myyy Im simple lost at words. This wonderful treasure is a testament on how other companies should compete. Since Oh myy crushes their competition without any effort. I&#x27;m honored to have found such a great Cologne which is a simple, sensational and greatly OH MYYY! Great experience.</li>
    <li> Why shy from the sky, when you can fly high with Takei&#x27;s &#x27;Eau My?&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not endorsed or sold in Canada.</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle after reading several reviews, convinced that this would be a good purchase.  When I sprayed it, it smelled nothing at all like I would have expected, but more like some form of alcoholic beverage.  I finally built up the courage to taste it, and wow was it good!  But what a hangover...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the distributor may be in the business of using the blue-colored Eau My as a cover for the distribution of Romulan Ale, which seems to be what was shipped to me by mistake.  A clever cover for sure, since the ale is highly illegal anywhere in the Federation.  I&#x27;d order again, but I&#x27;m very afraid I&#x27;d just get a bottle of worthless cologne instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating 3 stars because of the very tasty mixup.</li>
    <li> i sprayed this on my balls and now i have a rash on my balls. highly recommended for cock and ball torture enthusiasts</li>
    <li> Target this fragrance for your ship and prepare to be boarded. Got a buddy that&#x27;s been living long and perspiring? Spritz a little of this on them and go from oh damn to oh myyyyyyyyy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for his 35th birthday, on opening he spritzed himself and offered to paint me like one of his Scalosian girls. I inhaled deeply and wafting tendrils of mandarin and bergamot teleported me to other worlds, like Sobras for intense conversation, or Aldea where no one would see us kiss. Heady amber and musk embraced us and we warp sped to Orion I and held hands until the end of the world, and finally being enveloped in jasmine, fressia, ginger and vetiver we ended up in the sensual woods of Wrigley&#x27;s Pleasure Planet and he set his phaser to stun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, anyone who wears this is in for an unimaginable trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 3 stars because of the flash backs I get when I smell the fragrance again. They can be quite distracting.</li>
    <li> Works great when wearing blue or yellow, but if wearing red things tend to end very badly.  Be careful with this product!</li>
    <li> Eau My? Ohhhh YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I walk through department stores several times a week this time of year, aisles and aisles of fake celebrity scents clogging the clearance racks. Smell like Britney&#x27;s leftover stage glitter, Beyonces fierceness in a bottle, Kanye Wests had subtle notes of douchebag and shame. Sorry not for me. I always trudged past them on my way to a more manly Enterprise (nod) of video games and ammunition. Please do not think I purchase these together for any sort of dark political agenda or revenge plot, it just worked out that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, so I Trek (nod) past a counter and toward discounted snack cakes (for my pregnant wife naturally) and it hits me. I stood there stunned (nod) to a scent that was subtle and charming, with top notes of mandarin zest, Italian bergamot and fresh ozone transitioning to night-blooming jasmine, white freesia petals and grated ginger. Sensual woods, crystalized amber, soft skin musk, and vetiver will delight you when dry. Checking my current musk level, I decided that I must check out just one squirt of this scent engineering (nod) marvel. Imagine my surprise when I found the following items in the description, &amp;#34;Subtle and charming, with top notes of mandarin zest, Italian bergamot and fresh ozone transitioning to night-blooming jasmine, white freesia petals and grated ginger. Sensual woods, crystalized amber, soft skin musk, and vetiver will delight you when dry.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Destiny. It had to be. No other way all of these crisp and telling natural scents were exactly what i thought they were. I beamed (nod) from ear to ear, letting out a faint, &amp;#34;Oh My (nod) that is pleasant.&amp;#34; That is when I turned the bottle around. My God, it was as if a guiding light shone on the bottle, the mystical blue swooshed and swayed and in the pale white lighting. The bold Silver etched letters suggestively pointed downwards to the name of my scented savior. None other than George Takei. After tossing aside a few non essential items to budget in this new must have purchase (mostly gifts for my kids - they have enough I told myself!) I began my strut of newly fresh smelling confidence toward the check out counter, and then it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When circling the counter I came upon 2 masked men, one with a gun aimed at the stricken clerk, the other grabbing bags full of items that he clearly had not paid for. One wore a dark jacket and glasses, the other a long sleeved red shirt. I knew who my first target was. I checked my arm full of purchase possibilities and chose my weapons. The sound of the red plastic lightsaber (for my... cat.) sprang to life with lifelike effect and telescoping action, my other hand gripped my freshly opened bottle of wonder, er George Takei Sauce, scent.. sorry. Upon hearing the dreaded tones of the Imperial March come blaring from my 1/4&amp;#34; mono speaker they began to turn. I mumbled something about their lack of faith and thrusted my weapon toward the awestruck sidekick, catching him squarely in the unprotected eye with the perfectly rounded tip of the saber, sending the red shirted (nod) man to the ground, spilling the spoils onto the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gunman turned, hoisted his weapon away from the register and toward me, so I lashed out with the cool, scintillating vial of elegant nose pleasures. The man opened his mouth to yell something to me, only to find several finely puffed mists from the well designed and ergonomically functioning dispenser shooting directly into his gaping maw. Once the ambrosia like concoction hit his throat, I lept close and placed him into a bear hug, knocking the gun from his hand and forcing the man to inhale deeply as I pressed into his abdomen. As if fueled by an Andorian Mud Flea (nod) bite, I swelled with assurance as I watched his flared nostrils soak in the aroma of my sample sprays, mixing with his freshly soaked esophagus, I watched the man literally lose all breath, basking in what I can only imagine was Euphoria. (or lack of oxygen, and he was choking heavily.) We crashed to the floor like we had just taken 3 direct hits with shields down(nod), splaying us comically against an oddly placed single railing. (nod.. and not sure to this day why that was there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police showed up moments later, taking the men away. I found out later on from Captain Pike (nod) that the man in the red shirt had died (nod). Nobody knew why, nor did he have any identification. The hooded man said he had picked him up that day, and did not even know his name (nod). Shame. I was asked what had given me the gumption to attempt such an act of heroism in the sight of peril to my life. I simply held up the bottle of Eau My, the Captains&#x27; eyes calmed and he slowly nodded, no more words were needed. On his way out, he looked to the cashier and said only this, &amp;#34;Put that bottle on my tab.&amp;#34; She looked at her manager who tipped her hat to me (or where it would be, she wasn&#x27;t actually wearing one, but was a nice gesture.) and said, &amp;#34; Make it So.&amp;#34; (nod)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells great, fits in the hand well, foils robberies, and goes great with Sci Fi cliches, and Lightsabers... how this could get lower than 5 stars would be simply the Wrath of Khan. *(nod)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS -  We All Love Uncle Georgeagine was Euphoria. (or lack of oxygen, and he was choking heavily.) We crashed to the floor like we had just taken 3 direct hits with shields down(nod), splaying us comically against an oddly placed single railing.

    <li> This new cologne by George Takei is so stunning, that it has stunned Khan himself. It&#x27;s only logical that it&#x27;s Starfleet approved.</li>
    <li> Turn the Vulcan in your life into your very own Captain Kirk with this GORGEOUS fragrance!  Pon Farr anyone?  Eauuuu Myyyyyyy!</li>
    <li> Second best product I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon. Right after the banana cutter and right before the three wolf moon shirt. Now I can look good and smell awesome while cutting my bananas. Arigatō, Mr. Takei.</li>
    <li> One spritz of this and you will be transported to a universe of romance and intrigue.  Yes, you will be in command of the object of our affection.  Whatever the trek, your enterprise will not be in vain.  Rest assured, this heady elixir will drop both shields and panties instantly.  Arm your photon torpedoes and prepare to engage... in an evening of pon farr that would make the most stoic Vulcan turn green with embarrassment.  Remember, life is too short not to smell fabulous.  Especially if you&#x27;re a red-shirt, in that case I would also recommend the two day shipped that is free with Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> Sadly there are an overwhelmingly large number of useless reviews for this product.  If you are looking for an actual review from someone who purchased this product please see below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually smells really good. It is a lighter citrus fragrance of surprising quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great scent and has amazing powers. Not only did it help me with the ladies (and gentlemen) but it turned my beat up truck into a magnet for pure awesomeness, it also turned my brother who hates all things sci fi into one of the biggest trekkies i have ever met. The one negative ive found is it made me so awesome i got drunk on its power that when i was pulled over for speeding i sprayed the officer with the cologne. Lets just say what took place next is not legal in any country and luckily we were in Las Vegas so it will hopefully never be spoken of again. Granted it would have been smarter to not high jack that news helicopter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Cologne led to some great times but must be used in moderation. Else you may cause the next intergalactic war if your not careful.</li>
    <li> This stuff can de-scent the \\&quot;alpha quadrant\\&quot; of even the dirtiest klingon. Got B O? Think of this as your romulan cloaking shield of phew.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband &amp; Eau My God , I&#x27;m so glad I did . The smell is out of this world &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to trek to the shops to get it either !&lt;br /&gt;Guys you should buy this especially if you are single let&#x27;s just say you won&#x27;t be &#x27;sulu&#x27; for long , the girls ( &amp; guys) will love it :) Takei a leaf out of George&#x27;s book &amp; get it at warp speed before it flies off the shelves !!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I have to say I have a certain \\&quot;Allegiance\\&quot; to this product. I had to \\&quot;Trek\\&quot; around quite a bit to find it, but after a little help with my friends, I was able to acquire some. My \\&quot;Heroes.\\&quot; It has an amazing smell, and with just one spritz, you will smell like a \\&quot;Million Dollar Man.\\&quot; \\&quot;My Three Sons\\&quot; wear it also. Every time \\&quot;I Spy\\&quot; it in a store, I have to remember to \\&quot;Walk, Not Run\\&quot; to the checkout, because I get a bit excited. If they ever decide to cancel this item, they certainly will have to deal with \\&quot;The Wrath of Khan,\\&quot; as I will certainly be upset. Someone may get admitted to the nearest \\&quot;General Hospital.\\&quot; Seriously, you&#x27;ll have all the ladies (and gents) saying \\&quot;Eau Myyyyyyyyy\\&quot; when you walk by.</li>
    <li> Simply stunning!  I pre-ordered, dressed in my best red ensign shirt.  what could go wrong?  I opened the box and.....lovely!  Goes best with blue or gold shirts.</li>
    <li> You are alone on DeForest moon. There&#x27;s no Hunter around, You don&#x27;t understand what you are Doohan here or how you got into this situation, but you just grin and Barrett. You Takei your time as you walk and come upon a large pool of Walter. You peer into it and it reminds you of the wishing well back home. However, it&#x27;s not full of Nichols. You do see a strange fish swimming around, so you give him a name. Every day you come back, finding Nimoy swimming happily in the Marina. There&#x27;s no sign of civilization, no boats, no lights, no motorcars, no Gates. Just trees and the moss that aDorns them. You are free from all your cares and Burtons. The Grace of this place makes you feel at ease. You are enjoying the Laurel bushes when you hear a Roarke off in the distance. You nearly Shatner yourself in fear. You run away until your sides begin to Hoyt and you Peter out. Suddenly, a giant creature stands in front of you that looks like one of the greatest Frakes of nature ever. A shiver runs down your Spiner and you start wishing Scully and Muldaur were there to help you. You become weak in Denise and stand Pat. You take a Wheaton right then and there. The creature looks puzzled at you and says &amp;#34;Eau My!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, this is nothing like that.</li>
    <li> This fragrance in no way improved my dancing, but I did find myself attracting other nerd-types. The scent lingered, like Uncle George whispering &amp;#34;Oh myyy...&amp;#34; in my shoulder, boosting my confidence in approaching the hot girl in the corner with large lens glasses, and the skinny, bearded man at the bar. This night out might not have me living it up with the cool people, but I have new people to go on runs with on WoW AND an invite to a Star Trek TOS week-long marathon at my new friends house. Thanks Uncle George, &amp;#34;Eau Myyy&amp;#34; has helped us nerd-folk gain confidence, get out and meet each other IRL...</li>
    <li> Before &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; Cologne by George Takei, I was a real mess.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t hold a job in the Federation, I kept getting shipped from one station to another without ever knowing why. Each commander simply said I had done a decent job but I was needed elsewhere. It wasn&#x27;t until one grave night on the outer rim of the Barnard&#x27;s Galaxy (NGC 6822) that I finally discovered the terrible secret.&lt;br /&gt;I stank.&lt;br /&gt;It was made quite clear when the Borg Cube assimilated my entire section but left me in the burning remains of the space station. I begged them why? Why take my friends (alright, distant acquaintances) but spare me?&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you! When even the Borg won&#x27;t take you, that&#x27;s when you know you have a problem. That&#x27;s when I discovered &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; Cologne by George Takei. And now all the captain&#x27;s want me as their ship mechanic! And I don&#x27;t even know a thing about the internal workings of a hyperspace engine!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, George! You really turned this Klingon&#x27;s life around.</li>
    <li> DAY ONE: I put this on today and Instantly I&#x27;m gaining some sort of mind control ability. For some reason both men and women around Starfleet are helping me with things and some are even flirting. Captain Kirk won&#x27;t put his shirt back on and Uhuru keeps doing cartwheels and screaming \\&quot;OHHH MYYY HES HAILING ME ON A NEW FREQUENCY BABY!!!!!!!\\&quot; I&#x27;m kind of confused but for some reason I&#x27;m starting to like this. Sulu won&#x27;t even look at me. I&#x27;m not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY TWO: My colleagues say I&#x27;m starting to look Asian and Sulu is starting to look eerily Caucasian. On the bright side every girl (and some guys) want to date me. My intelligence is boosted 110% from normal and my math, language, and reasoning skills are sharpening. More weird things, I&#x27;m slightly intoxicated now because at lunch everyone is bringing me alcohol. Every woman I pass is doing cartwheels and I&#x27;m stharting to talk with a lithp. Intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 3: I just love rainbows! I&#x27;ve been sewing and knitting them all over my uniform! I&#x27;ve also noticed that Starfleet really need a style change. SO OUTDATED. I&#x27;ve been working endlessly to make absolutely fabulous new pastel colored outfits and great new shoes! I&#x27;m gaining a large fanbase among the crew and Kirk is starting to get jealous. Pretty much everyone has made a pass at me and I&#x27;m actually starting to enjoy it! I&#x27;ve gotten extremely good at fencing and it&#x27;s just FABULOUS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 4: I think I&#x27;m becoming Hikaru Sulu. Whatever is happening, we&#x27;re connected. I&#x27;ve taken over his position on the bridge and go on away teams instead of him. The effects are waning but the last Gorn we met mysteriously started flirting with me and kissing me. I&#x27;m not sure what is happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 5: I am Hikaru Sulu. I am George Takei.  I...AM...........FABOULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a joke because he is really into the whole star wars thing.  He even speaks warf sometimes during sex.  Which isn&#x27;t very often or satisfying for that matter.  But on to the review.  When it came in the mail I thought it was going to be harsh and my husbands sceriousis would get worse from it.  But it is a great smelling calogne and I and my husband love it.  He gets compliments at his work at game stop all the time.  Try it for yourself and see that you will be like Captain Spock repelling clingons off Uranis.</li>
    <li> i must confess, i have yet to try eau my, i just wanted to be part of the action.  but i am getting some soon.</li>
    <li> Smelling like a nebula has never been more erotic. Unlike many relationships, this magnificent fragrance will have you shouting &amp;#34;eau yes&amp;#34; and seeing stars for hours. It is the lord of sensual scents and arousing aromas. Don&#x27;t wait, try Eau My and get your &amp;#34;eau face&amp;#34; on.</li>
    <li> This cologne is incredible!  Light, fresh and energizing, just like the man who inspired it.  It just arrived today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it; I feel sexier, smarter, better looking and more fabulous already.&lt;br /&gt;And, just for the record, I&#x27;m a woman and this smells great on me.  It&#x27;s a perfect fragrance for anyone who wants to feel like a star traveler or just a star.</li>
    <li> Ohhh myyy!  This is a lovely scent, not too overpowering.  Love the name and the humor of how it was named.  George Takai has a winner here!  By the way, I&#x27;m a female and I&#x27;m using.  I got it for a friend, but decided to keep it myself.  I&#x27;ll have to buy another one for him.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a formidable scent.  It stings the nostrils.  In a good way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna be honest, here.  It smells like pure gasoline.</li>
    <li> I received the cologne and immediately loved the scent. However after the third use the atomizer stopped working. I am still able to use the cologne minimally by inverting the bottle and pumping the atomizer several times to get a scant amount to come out. Would have been 5 stars if not for the atomizer issue.</li>
    <li> I feel like I ought to be writing something terribly witty, considering that George Takei is involved (and some of the other reviews are pretty entertaining!)....but all I have at the moment is hey! I love this stuff! Just received some for a birthday gift from my daughter (she says &amp;#34;I trust George&amp;#34;)....I wasn&#x27;t actually able to detect all the scents listed in the description, but the overall effect is fresh, light, and citrusy. There are very few colognes that I like at all, so it&#x27;s an event when I find one which I like as much as this.</li>
    <li> The lid is not tight. So if you put this in your bag and use the top to pull it out, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. The scent is good for men and women.</li>
    <li> At $40 an ounce, I can beam into any party!  Uncle George, you should sing Rocket Man (in the style of Bill Shatner) holding your Eau My.  You&#x27;d easily get $60 an ounce after that..</li>
    <li> Got this for a Star-Trek fan.  She loved it.  It&#x27;s a good scent that could work for a man or a woman.</li>
    <li> Enchanting and sophisticated, just like the man himself. &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; delivers on so many levels. Elegant bottle, clean scent,&lt;br /&gt;ultimate collectors item, geek treasure. This stuff is so hot! I hear rumors that Brian Boitano wears it. Love love love.&lt;br /&gt;Get it.</li>
    <li> How can you NOT like ANYTHING by George Takei? Oh, my!!! He&#x27;s a living legend, funny and smart. Excellence in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I love George so much. Such a crazy sense of humor but the strength and integrity to stand up and take a stand about issues that matter in this world. I hope this is a nebula sized success. Also, if it gets me command of my own starship, ill buy a crate of the stuff :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because I&#x27;m a big George/Sulu fan. Turns out it smells great and I&#x27;ve had several compliments.</li>
    <li> Gave it to a friend. He likes it. He still has to work which is why I gave it to him.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn scent in many, many years (since a sergeant coming up behind me during a training exercise shouted \\&quot;I can&#x27;t see you, but I can smell you, so I just killed you with a grenade.\\&quot;), but my family obliged my nerd-crush on George Takei and bought me this for Christmas. It&#x27;s nice, not overwhelming, and has gotten more than a few compliments. I&#x27;ve not had the oft-mentioned bottle problems, not have I tasted it for traces of Romulan Ale.</li>
    <li> Eau My is a light, fresh scent that could work for people of any gender. It reminds me of three scents I&#x27;ve worn in the past - Benetton&#x27;s Cold may be the closest match, but then I picked up hints of Eternity for men, and Nautica for women. After a quick google search, I saw that all of them share some ingredients, so I suppose it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that it seems familiar.</li>
    <li> Just like description, smells fresh.</li>
    <li> More a men&#x27;s fragrance than women&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I used this and now I&#x27;m gay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot, George. Now I have to cross my legs at the knee, randomly break into song, and have weirdly specific feelings about watching wrestling. I&#x27;ve never had decorative soaps before, but now I have decorative soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, this is all pretty fabulous NOW, but give me a heads-up next time. Fair?</li>
    <li> I was not at all suprised to find that this smells a lot like a combination of old man butt and soy sauce...</li>
    <li> I really cannot wait to try it - I hope it makes me want to do bad things in the backseat of Admiral Kirk&#x27;s shuttlecraft.</li>
    <li> Ooooh myyyyyyyyy, It smells like a concoction of hairy stinky sweaty man ass and vaseline i love it ooooooh myyyyyyyy</li>
    <li> In the vast black vacuums of space a meteoroid crashed into small innocuous planet. When the native life of the planet broke the meteor open they were met with a blinding white light and with a scent so pungent and glorious that they sprouted noses on their previously flat, amorphous faces. Years were devoted to harvesting the scent from the rock, dropping all other means of progressive innovation and social construct in order to be able to reproduce and cultivate the scent. It was thought that the scent could be the salvation of their planet and for years it was just that. But eventually it became too great for them to handle. The atmosphere became a hazy smog, Civilizations crumbled, and in a last effort to save their planet from complete war and destruction, scientists took the remains of the original meteor and the scent procured from it and shot it out into space. Now it has found ourself on our planet. It&#x27;s power is great and unlike anything we have come to know or smell thus far. It may eventually be the demise of our world, but what a great smelling way to go.</li>
    <li> We finally know how Captain Kirk got lucky in every episode of Star Trek.  Who could resist this fragrance? &amp;#34;You&#x27;ll learn something about men and women...the way they&#x27;re supposed to be. Caring for each other, being happy with each other, being good to each other. That&#x27;s what we call love. You&#x27;ll like that a lot. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It reminds me of that summer I spent in Italy.  That sultry morning I spent with my lover.  Drinking Early Grey and suggestively peeling oranges.  Breathing in the fresh country air.  We could still smell the jasmine that bloomed last night.  Our ginger scones only added to the excitement.  We thought we might wander into the nearby woods.  Our amber eyes gazing at each other expectantly.  As we inhaled each other’s soft skin musk, I exclaimed:  KHUS!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband of 8 years. He was a bit unsure but after he tried it out he fell in love!!&lt;br /&gt;Only now, his new boyfriend wants a bottle too.....&lt;br /&gt;signed&lt;br /&gt;Loving Wife</li>
    <li> I recommend this Cologne to all of the red shirt Starfleet officers out there! This will make all the other officer on your ship, Klingons, Romulans and everyone else saying Eau My, right before you die.</li>
    <li> Eau My Goodness...&lt;br /&gt;Head out, bearing it all!&lt;br /&gt;You rock, George, This is amazing stuff! Definitely a classy and classic scent.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to be Takei to be FABULOUS, but it sure helps. One spritz and even your neighbor&#x27;s ugly Uncle Clevis, from West Virginia, will tell you that &amp;#34;you got a purty mouth.&amp;#34; I put some on, and I was the never same. Through the power of Eau My, I was transformed into the pure force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real tragedy is that it isn&#x27;t unlimited.....thanks Obama.</li>
    <li> I recently ran out of Poo Pourri, (that miracle of modern science that cloaks the odor of a deuce when sprayed in the bowl prior to releasing the hounds) so I reached for Uncle George&#x27;s Eau My Cologne Spray. Necessity is the mother of invention, so they say. Not only did it work just as well as Poo Pourri, there was also another wonderful effect. Evidently some of the spray wafted up onto my derrière, because for the rest of the day folks were just clamoring to kiss my a$$. I&#x27;ve been using Eau My this way ever since and I highly recommend this product to anyone who has been suffering from low self-esteem and a putrid bathroom.</li>
    <li> Stunning. Perfect for a long trek or just for when you want to don your Takei apparel. Appropriate if you&#x27;re Takei or just believe,  as I do, that it&#x27;s OK to be Takei.</li>
    <li> New Ship Scent mixed with a hint of Orion Girl&#x27;s pheromones. They&#x27;re chasing me down like I was Captain Kirk!!!!</li>
    <li> When you want to smell like the man who makes you laugh in the mornings..............as you are scrolling through Facebook..............on the toilet.</li>
    <li> To be sure you don&#x27;t smell like Willie Schatner or acquire an over inflated ego, apply this liberally often and daily!</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;ll never smell as bad as Kirk on an away mission again. Set a course for sexy and... Engage.</li>
    <li> This new cologne is hyperspace for your face and beyond! Splash it on and enter another dimension of the senses!</li>
    <li> George Takei&#x27;s &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; cologne is a perfect blend of herbal impulse of jasmine/freesia sweetness and masculine warp-drive of bergamot/mandarin orange musk.&lt;br /&gt;Ricardo Montalban would have approved and Benedict Cumberbatch drank it to get into the role of &amp;#34;Khan&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACT.&lt;br /&gt;Dilithium crystals can be re-crystalized with only a spray. Might come in handy when you hijack a Klingon Bird of Prey with naught but a leather jacket and a pound of style.&lt;br /&gt;Eau My indeed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has the effect of love potion number 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how saying like a boss after a statement makes even the lamest statement awesome? This has the same effect but without actually having to say anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like doing healing jutsu without handsigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how Beyonce&#x27;s new album made butterflies weep in passionate agony? similar effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy wet dreams or similar experiences then click &amp;#34;buy now&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you spray it at just the right angle you will spontaneously create a unicorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the cure for &amp;#34;republican&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes you taller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It guarantees long life and prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cures the gum disease gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns an opponent&#x27;s shadow pikachu into magicarp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns your magicarp into shadow pikachu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It invented edo tensei then sold the patent to Tobirama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the red pill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has won four Grammys all in the category &amp;#34;lifetime achievement&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is cited on the Chuck Norris website under the &amp;#34;heroes&amp;#34; section of his bio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ghost writes for Jay Z&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designed the logo for Google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrote the guitar solo in &amp;#34;Free Bird&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the reason for a lack of forehead ridges in some Klingons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a driver named Kato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can travel at warp 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the phaser setting commonly referred to as &amp;#34;stun&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other benefits exist, however they are yet to be discovered at the writing of this review.</li>
    <li> George may have tried to fly the Excelsior apart... But you&#x27;ll always SMELL the part with this delightful Cologne... Beam it up now.</li>
    <li> This is simply the hottest thing to spritz on a man&#x27;s face, I mean on his body,  sometimes I just throw some on his back... Wait, Eau My!!</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve thought, &amp;#34;I can do everything on the internet except smell it.&amp;#34;  Now I can.  As I scroll down my Facebook page reading  shared George Takei jokes, I can pick up my bottle of Eau My, spritz the air, and add that je ne sais quoi.  Thank you, George!</li>
    <li> As I pulled the wrapper off, my eyes beamed at George Takei \\&quot;Eau My\\&quot; in its glory.  I slapped it behind my ears and slapped it on my cheeks.  The aroma is light and pleasant that you can stick it most places without an unwanted burn.  I recommend George Takei everytime you are looking for an evening of having your senses stroked and leave you saying Eau My to everyone who asks what are you wearing. 5 warping stars!!!!</li>
    <li> I wear this fragrance every day at the academy, as I dream of my first assignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night, I forgot to hop into the sonic showers and wash the scent off before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up covered in captains.</li>
    <li> Having trouble hooking up?  Are tribbles weighing you down? Need a little help with your thrusters? GT&#x27;s \\&quot;Eau My\\&quot; can transport you to a whole new plane of existence. A spritz of \\&quot;Eau My\\&quot; and NO species will be able to resist smelling your business. Make every encounter a contact sport.</li>
    <li> Finally! A great perfume put out by my favorite helm jockey! A definite essential for all of those out on a five year mission to get laid.</li>
    <li> Any man with class and taste, only need to put on his Eau Face. Warp through the galaxy with style and cunning, even a Klingon could set his date nights to stunning! So let it be known, wright on a history page for even Jean Luc would have to engage.....</li>
    <li> Only 2 words needed to describe this amazing (well I gave it 5 stars) fragrance by our funny friend........face palm</li>
    <li> Once you spray this on, you&#x27;ll see rainbows and feel gay - even if you are not!!  Open your horizons and your mind!</li>
    <li> I like to spray this on my taint before a night of eating Mexican food.  It really helps to mask the odor in the likely event that I crap my pants and gives me enough time to make a hasty escape for a fresh change of clothes.  Thanks, Eau My!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how a product can change your entire life. Eau My by George Takei did. The moment I got a spray of it, men and women all over me WANTED me. And I&#x27;m not talking about a flirt, hell no... they wanted the whole deal.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just a little concerned that their partner is OCP, I do remember the Detroit incident with that robot.</li>
    <li> You may be wondering, oh why? But you must trust in George Takei. The delightful fragrance is entitled Eau My. You must decide to buy, buy, buy!</li>
    <li> This boldly goes where no scent has gone before. It is gently enticing rather than having it Klingon in a brash and overbearing manner.  I want to Takei a minute to say what a wonder Enterprise the maker of this fragrance has undertaken in bringing this to market.  Live long and prosper!</li>
    <li> To me this smells somewhat like Aspen. So, if you Like the scent of Aspen and you wanted this for the Scent, get that instead.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!  It&#x27;s not girly or manly.  A clean fresh scent that everyone can wear!  Thank you Uncle George!</li>
    <li> We bought this as a nice birthday present for our close friend Brian.  We were going to a surprise party and boy were we surprised when he put this cologne on!  Axe has nothing on this nectar of the gods.  It started with one spray.  Brian was the life of the party.  He invented three new dance moves and broke out singing a new hit song.  As the night ran on -- and another spray, Brian took the party to a whole new level.  This became a rave!  At one point, Brian started playing the guitar and singing really cool tunes.  Soon there were two more sprays and suddenly we were all flying to Monaco to continue the party.  Oh, did I mention that Jay Z was driving by his place on the way to the lake and heard his singing and offered him a $10M record deal and the use of his private jet for the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in Monaco, Brian decided to play a few games in the casino.  It was his birthday and he was feeling lucky.  Three sprays and a $10M bet on black (always bet on black -- that is what Jay Z told him), Brian doubled his money and we were all off to race F1 cars in the streets of Monaco.  Brian had the great idea that we should break into the local zoo and see how the lions and tigers did at driving a stick.  I thought this was not the best idea -- but was soon shown to be wrong when 2 sprays and a beef stick later, two lions and one tiger were burning rubber on the track.  It is awesome to see what a good smelling tiger can do for a beef stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian had a great birthday and Eau My made it quite memorable.  I only wish that it came in a bigger size because the lions really liked it.  It got a little dicey at 15,000 feet over the Atlantic on the way home when we ran out and the lions decided they did not want to continue flying the plane.  Let&#x27;s just say that our life raft ride home was not nearly as eventful as the rest of the evening -- but those are stories for another review.</li>
    <li> My friends and I have lovingly stated that this cologne smells &amp;#34;Exactly as an amazing gay Asian man should.&amp;#34; Which is pretty damn awesome! Wear this for your lover and have them saying, &amp;#34;Oh my!&amp;#34; ;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s illegal in nine countries... Yep, it&#x27;s made with bits of real panther, so you know it&#x27;s good. They&#x27;ve done studies, you know. 60% of the time, it works every time.</li>
    <li> Great smelling stuff. Love it.</li>
    <li> Twas a wonderful product, however it must be kept in mind that translated, &amp;#34;Eau my George Takei&amp;#34; translates to &amp;#34;water my George Takei.&amp;#34; This is unacceptable, as I already have someone who does for me daily; courtesy of, surprise surprise, &amp;#34;Eau my.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This brief review will also include the effects of George Takei&#x27;s new fragrance, Eau My (1.7 oz spray, $45.29) on my marriage of 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins with the bottle, made of a heavy, finely polished glass (which I can only assume is cubic zirconia), that curves ever so slightly, allowing it to be grasped firmly in the hand...  The sleek metal cap glides off effortlessly.  The bottle&#x27;s first spray sets the tone, and measure, of future sprays so I hold off until morning.  It was sublime, delivering a gentle kiss of mist upon the skin instantly cooling, then warming it ever so slightly.  Then the fragrance reaches the nose triggering a fleeting moment of clarity.  And so it begins...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the weeks went by, I became intoxicated with Eau My’s effects.  Little did I know that my wife was frighteningly allergic to night-blooming jasmine and white freesia petals, the very ingredients that give this sweet nectar its nourishing life.  All manners of remedy from doctors to allergists, even the prospect of surgery were explored.  Nothing could be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a choice… My wife, or my Eau My.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we&#x27;ve been separated for 3 months now.  Her swelling has decreased, the itchy skin and rashes have cleared up, and the migraines and night terrors have subsided.  We even see each other every now and then, but only from a distance.  I care for her too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has a better life now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so do I.</li>
    <li> What, not eligible for Prime!!!??? That&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m setting a course for the Alpha Quadrant warp factor 2, firing  photon torpedos  aft. Engage...&lt;br /&gt;Besides, using this product will turn others of the opposite sex into Klingons (clinging factor 10 out of 10)</li>
    <li> Great fragrance by George Takei.</li>
    <li> The name alone was enough to intrigue me. Once it arrived, I tried it, and was instantly satisfied with the purchase. the fragrance is calming and enticing. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to feel dapper, and to anyone who likes George Takei.</li>
    <li> I guess I will have to find a guy who wants to wear this.  I like it just fine but the nurses I work with accuse me of having a boyfriend that really pours on the perfume that gets on me when we kiss or hug.  The guys I have let smell it say it is too feminine for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda stuck as to when I can wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the above around January 15, 2013 and have since started wearing it all the time.  I bought it for me.  I like it!  It is wonderful and everyone else just needs to get over it.  If they don&#x27;t like it they need to stay far enough away so they don&#x27;t smell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while I even made myself an arts and crafts name badge that read...\\&quot;I am [my name]!  I am wearing Eau My By Takei\\&quot;  You have to understand what a conservative State and neighborhood I live in.  No one made any comment or asked anything so buy this product and baptize your self in it.  I would have told them...\\&quot;Can&#x27;t find it at Target.  Will have to get on Amazon for this jewel.  IT IS MAJESTIC!!!&lt;br /&gt;2/2/14</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the aroma of this simple fragrance. Although, I no sooner put it on and was made uneasy (probably because I&#x27;m straight) by some strange older Asian man saying \\&quot;Course laid in, Captain.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> That Eau My smells a little better than Ew Shatner! So say I. So say I. And so say I.</li>
    <li> and it is a nice scent.  I just can&#x27;t say it is a scent that works for both men and women.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased Eau My out of shear novelty and GT fan-boy-ness.  What I didn&#x27;t expect was a fragrance that is truly fabulous.  Next thing I know I&#x27;m getting noticed, complimented, and finding myself solving crimes involving complex martial arts and training I have never had.  I&#x27;ve never used a bow and arrow in my life, but with Eau My I feel I hit the bulls-eye.  There is one downside though, now everyone around me wants it too.</li>
    <li> Gave to my Trekkie brother for Christmas - thought it was perfect! Has a nice smell, not overpowering or obnoxious. Would recommend &amp; buy again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Nozzle broke on the second day, pumping all the liquid to come out the neck in a drool</li>
    <li> I have no nose and I&#x27;m still giving this product a 5-star review.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy a lot of cologne or other scent enhancements; the last one I bought was over 15 years ago in high school, which was Tommy Hilfiger, and I can say that Eau My is similar. it is a very pleasant smell, I quite like it. My wife likes it as well.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t quibble for a tribble, but I will sigh for more &#x27;Eau My.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Eau My&#x27; makes me feel naughty...like a drunken Mr. Scotty.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the ladies mistake you for a jerk! Apply &#x27;Eau My&#x27; and you&#x27;ll be their Captain Kirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice scent that is not overpowering, the lass likes it, thats all that matters to me.</li>
    <li> It smells horribly cheap but after it dries it does have a somewhat pleasant smell. A bit too flowery for my liking.</li>
    <li> Now every one can smell like everyones favorite gay asian uncle eau my had me smelling so fresh i was farting rainbows and had a line of men following me around get it.gwt it now!</li>
    <li> Eau My!  I never knew getting a hold of a little George could be so easy!  I&#x27;m going to get one for each of my stocking stuffers this Christmas.  I&#x27;m sure the scent will beam me right up to heaven, thanks GT!</li>
    <li> I regret that I just give Eau My Cologne Spray just 2 stars out of respect for the the much maligned number 2, and because GT is now too famous to take my calls.</li>
    <li> If the reviews of this product don&#x27;t out-funny Tuscan Whole Milk 1-gallon and those of its ilk, I will be extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to George for being so relentlessly relevant, and so endlessly amusing.  He brings such light into the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great idea, and even though I don&#x27;t wear cologne, I&#x27;m ordering some right now.  &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> I am a man of science, and as such, recently conducted an experiment to test the validity of Mr. Takei&#x27;s claim that \\&quot;Eau My\\&quot; will, to paraphrase, \\&quot;deliver the finest scent in the whole of the Alpha Quadrant.\\&quot;  In the interest of fairness, my assistant delivered three different scents on three different nights: one was the \\&quot;leading brand,\\&quot; one was saline.  The last was, of course, \\&quot;Eau My.\\&quot;  He recorded the events that transpired - keeping in mind that I was unaware (at the time) of what was being administered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first was the leading cologne.  My assistant noted more compliments than I typically received on my scent, but nothing of particular significance.  The second was saline solution.  No effects, either beneficial or adverse, were noted.  The third contained Takei&#x27;s \\&quot;Eau My.\\&quot;  By 8 PM, I had bedded seven women. Two of the encounters were threesomes; one was a foursome.  My success continued as I began touring trendy, upscale New York clubs.  Each invited my assistant and me to their respective VIP sections at no charge, as well as refusing payment for drinks on the grounds that \\&quot;a man of your stature is above such things.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riding high on the wave of Takei&#x27;s sprayable elixir, I pulled out the bottle and decided to refresh my scent.  That, my friends, is where it all went so terribly wrong.  The club lights painted the walls in a horrifying way - a sea of faces writhing and contorting themselves into pained expressions - while the sound of Daft Punk&#x27;s \\&quot;Get Lucky\\&quot; turned into a cacophony of anguished shrieks, each building and building until I felt my psyche shrink into itself a thousand times over.  I collapsed onto the floor, and looked up to see the man who I believed was the Devil, but was in fact my assistant.  He rushed me to our Maserati - we had been gifted one by a man who asked nothing but to bask in my effervescence for a few brief moments - and sped back toward the lab amidst the wail of ambulance sirens.  We arrived some minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding myself in a state of sheer psychosis, and frantic to recapture the glory of my earlier conquests, I began injecting the cologne.  Yet no more than a few seconds after administering the dose, I had torn the needle from my arm, stabbed my assistant repeatedly, and mutilated much of his face and neck.  I then began to eat three of my own fingers - a behavior often referred to as \\&quot;pheromone-induced self-cannibalism\\&quot; in medical literature - before declaring myself \\&quot;Arch Wyvern of Thee Black Abyss\\&quot; and painting the walls with bloody, sacrilegious symbols.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this in mind, I can only tepidly recommend George Takei&#x27;s \\&quot;Eau My.\\&quot;  Three sprays are pure magic; after four or more, you run the risk of waking up days later to find that everyone you love has been murdered by your own hand.s later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding myself in a state of sheer psychosis, and frantic to recapture the glory of my earlier conquests, I began injecting the cologne.

    <li> After spraying Eau My liberally on myself. Ensign Smith allowed me to play with his Phaser (boy was I stunned)!</li>
    <li> Awesome description! Not sure if I should wear it, drink it or make love to it! Maybe all three, though not sure in what order...</li>
    <li> The cologne smells okay, but the spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t work! Every time I try to spray it, it runs down the side of the bottle with nothing spraying! If problem isn&#x27;t addressed, there will be NO repeat purchases. Sorry, but I Can not recommend this at this time.</li>
    <li> Fresh, clean with just a hint of citrus and tea.  This scent makes me feel like a sweaty, musky, sword-wielding helmsman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have an increased urge to break out into show-tunes... In short, utterly fabulous!  Oh my!  I need more Eau My!</li>
    <li> The fragrance smells like a cross between CK Escape and Acqua di gio.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s a combination of a very winter scent with the spices and a summer scent with the citrus.&lt;br /&gt;If you like the above two colognes, you will like this one.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Make it so.</li>
    <li> If your command console explodes in your face, apply Eau My to prevent heart flutters. Also, it will make you see rainbows.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bottle of liquid that smells. The bottle is made out of glass. The bottle has words on it.</li>
    <li> I opened the packaging and I found that the instructions were unclear, this lead me to getting my gameboy lodged inside a pigeon...</li>
    <li> So I bought this product thinking this was a simple bit of scented water that was bottled up in the far corners of the galaxy by alien children in sweat shops. I simply thought that this little vial would stain the most shimmering of celebrity names by container nothing more than something used to freshen the air the the &amp;#34;Captain&#x27;s Quarters&amp;#34; after dropping a &amp;#34;Photon Torpedo&amp;#34; down the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But boy, was I in the ride for a life time. This ladies, germs, and whatever alien planet you may be from is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;The moment I put this on, found myself instantly teleported to another world, in which I was loved by anything and everything.&lt;br /&gt;Women were whistling at me, men couldn&#x27;t wait to adjust my uniform.&lt;br /&gt;Heck my own cat finally showed me affection, and for anyone who knows anything about cats, you know they are the masters of their own realm and will only love you on their terms and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No long folks. This rare gem will get pulses racing at light speed and clothes off at ludicrous speed.&lt;br /&gt;Even Ron Burgundy&#x27;s Sex Panther is a mere rescue shuttle compared to the mighty Klingon Bird of Prey that is Eau My.&lt;br /&gt;This thing will have others wanting to &amp;#34;bond&amp;#34; with you faster than the Borgs can say the word &amp;#34;Assimilate&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this will make Commander Shepard and Barney Stinson look like harmless kittens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say, other than the potency of this Elixir of (Making)Life, the only down side is that anyone wearing red is stunned.&lt;br /&gt;PERMANENTLY.&lt;br /&gt;So be warned, but otherwise, use this and boldy go where no man/woman has gone before.</li>
    <li> It was everything I ever hoped for. From the first mighty splash, I knew I had made the right decision. On my way to work, traffic parted as if it were the Red Sea and I was some Disco-Themed Moses, with my polyester pantsuit and lifetime of bad decisions. Upon reaching work, one whiff of my musky odeur and my boss immediately promoted me to CEO and God of all that we manufacture, namely nail polish remover pads, but nevertheless, I was awesome in his sight. After a day of complete and utter adoration by accounting, I was whisked away to drinks with the President of the United States, who immediately granted me a pardon for all past and future crimes, and asked me to rule the world. Of course I couldn&#x27;t deny that I was perfect for the job. Soon I found myself surrounded by the entire male cast of the Lord of the Rings (minus Gimli, I mean I do have some standards here people) scantily clad and dancing for my pleasure. Yummy! Best day ever! So thank you, Eau My, for making all my dreams come true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, until I woke up in a pile of my own sick after some grade A hallucinations. Apparently you aren&#x27;t supposed to drink this stuff. Forewarned is forearmed, or something like that. *hurk*</li>
    <li> Moving at warp speed, I removed the Klingon that was stuck to my Tribble like bottom.  Concerned about not following the right S.S.S. order I quickly reached for my bottle of EAU MY, in the fabulous GT bottle.  I spritzed my dainty body in preparation for my date and needless to say, I was saying EAU MY all night.</li>
    <li> Oh no, my Eau My! These words escaped my lips just as my beloved cologne inched its way off of my bureau. My arm extended, I lunged from across the room in an attempt to save it. By the time my fingertips brushed its side, it was too late. The eau lay spreading across the floor in a steadily expanding puddle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman, it was my lifeline for attracting, well...other women. You see, I&#x27;m a lesbian and a socially awkward one at that. To top it off, I&#x27;m a girly girl with a nice figure so I&#x27;m often fending off seemingly sex crazed men hoping to take me out to a nice restaurant (at least that&#x27;s what I tell myself their motives are anyway). It&#x27;s a difficult combination of sorts. I can&#x27;t tell you the number of times I&#x27;ve stood in a dimly lit bar with a martini between my delicate fingers trying to muster up enough courage to approach a beautiful woman across the room. And then a man advances towards me, a handsome face and confident smile upon his lips. He cooly asks me if I&#x27;d like to dance and I awkwardly reply with averted eyes, overly used hand gestures, and a shaky stuttering voice, \\&quot;Um, no thanks.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Assuming my awkwardness is some pathetic attempt of playing hard to get, the man continues, \\&quot;Why not, sweetheart, it&#x27;s just one dance. And I might ask you out to dinner afterwards, too, to the new (insert fancy, expensive restaurant here).\\&quot; He winks. At which point, I start to perspire, my martini glass and hand start to slightly shake, and I blurt out,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;No! I&#x27;m a lesbian!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I receive the once over, and listen to the dreaded comment similar to, \\&quot;Oh. Well, I bet you&#x27;re the woman in the relationship,\\&quot; as he winks once more and moves onto his next potential prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, my problem was that I was constantly attracting the wrong sex, and I clearly lacked the confidence and social skills to overcome this issue. That is, until a friend of mine bought me this wonderful \\&quot;Eau My\\&quot; cologne. I tell you, the smell was fantastic alone, but the night I first wore it to a bar, I learned its true magic. No longer were men advancing closer than three feet of me because I smelled like competition, and I had a few women approach me! It was as if I was sending off enough \\&quot;butchness\\&quot; to threaten the straight men and reel in the beautiful women. This act alone instilled in me a confidence I had never known before. I began standing straighter and with a firmer grip on my martini glass whenever I spoke to women. Eau My was a true gift! I was picking up a new woman every other night. It was as if I was making up for lost time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until my Eau My fell to its doom. I managed to salvage some of it by dunking parts of my night clothes in it. But, that didn&#x27;t work out very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is, I need to purchase another bottle. It is truly worth the 5 stars I&#x27;ve given it. If you&#x27;re straight, gay, or lesbian I guarantee it will improve your romantic life. Get it, use it, and score...a lot.</li>

    <li> This is something that has never happened before. After reading the reviews and the experiences people had with Eau My, I had an actual &#x27;oh my&#x27; moment myself. I could drift away on a scent I hadn&#x27;t actually smelled yet, go to exotic places smelling of oranges and bergamot, have orgies with total strangers, male and female, who threw themselves at me, be beamed into a world of pleasure, receive gifts of strangers just for basking in my presence. Startling awake I saw  my husband having the same experience. Oh my, we need to get ourselves some Eau My</li>

    <li> It may be a scent that&#x27;s been around and smelled over and over again, but it&#x27;s being re-released with a pun by George Takei so you know you want to share it with all your friends.</li>
    <li> Look folks, I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet.  Best. Cologne. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one spray...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m now a fantastic dancer.&lt;br /&gt;My pancakes taste better.&lt;br /&gt;I found my lost earring.&lt;br /&gt;My traveling companion and I were upgraded to First Class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidence?  I think not.</li>
    <li> As I walked out the restroom stall, having previously disposed of my own version of an overbearing Shatner, I made my way to the sink and began to wash my hands. Walking to the door, the obviously French washroom attendant handed me a towel and spoke, &amp;#34; I sense that someone had a healthy dinner. Oui oui...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reacting to what I assumed was an attempt at a joke I responded, &amp;#34;No wee, just a heavy Shatner.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He looked at me in a rather sardonic manner, and forced a small laugh. &amp;#34;Perhaps a pleasant scent to rid you of the lingering odor?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a moment to wonder how many females from the series were asked the same question after being onset. Coming back to the moment at hand, I said to the attendant, &amp;#34; How about something that will arouse the senses of a fine prospect?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attendant responded with a heavily baritone, &amp;#34;Eau My.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eyed him pensively, &amp;#34;Perhaps something from Mr. Combs or that fellow married to Beyonce.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rolling his eyes, the attendant reiterated, as he pulled out a bottle, &amp;#34;No. Eau My by George Takei.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I could ask for a tester, the attendant immediately began to spray me generously with the cologne. I eyed him rather angrily until I caught a whiff of the stunning fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Oh my. That is quite plea-SCENT.&amp;#34; I responded&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously tired of my attempts at humor, the attendant quickly ushered me out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately I found myself being caressed by a young beauty, obviously focused like a lioness that caught scent of her prey . She tried to speak, only to be shoved out of the way by another voracious female gone berserk. She held close to me, sniffing the length of my neck. Almost as instantly as she was there, she was gone, shoved out of the way by a muscular young man who looked determined to get what he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following moments flashed by in an instant as a riot broke out in the entire restaurant. Men and women of all ages fought to be close to me. How I escaped with my life, I will never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never have I experienced such a fine product. Be warned however, if a washroom attendant utters the words &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; to you, be prepared for the night of your life.</li>
    <li> George Takei was kindful enough to send this all the way to my planet. Now beside Takei always getting into 3 ways with me and other people i&#x27;m trying to talk to. (&amp;#34;Oh Myyy!!!&amp;#34;) &amp;#34;Dang it Takei, i&#x27;m trying to make a review!!&amp;#34; Anyways, ever since i&#x27;ve tried this, it&#x27;s so much better than just my natural musk. Bubbles and Gregory aren&#x27;t getting onto me as often and even Bojack has calmed down a bit. (&amp;#34;Arg! There is still a planet in me way!!&amp;#34;) &amp;#34;Shut up, Bojack!&amp;#34; George Takei has finally come up with something that i actually like. It&#x27;s not often you can impress a Kai. Thank you Takei, now i&#x27;m going to go find the Verizon guy and give him a brick that he deserves.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good, it&#x27;s inspired me to write a Hikaru- um, I mean Haiku:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t phase this out&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very Enterprising&lt;br /&gt;Takei&#x27;s own bouquet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get dropped faster than a crewman in a red shirt, but now with &#x27;Eau My&#x27;, the ladies Klingon to me. Do yourself a favor and get some todei!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the ingredient breakdown, but until I tried this fine cologne on, I couldn&#x27;t imagine what it would be like.  Balance is probably the key word here: it&#x27;s not too masculine or feminine.  Not too sweet, not too floral, not too musky.  I could describe it as a much more sophisticated version of Old Spice, but I&#x27;m sure I would be way off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is, it smells good when you spray it on in the morning, and still does at the end of the day.  This is not a scent I could easily tire of -- and probably the easiest way to smell like George Takei.</li>
    <li> Reader, before my humble tale unfolds, you must know that I am not, nor have I ever been the most – how do I put this? – “manly” of young Englishmen. I was never one for sports in school, nor did I have the largest circle of school friends. I was, the wiry, knock-kneed kid with a bad haircut who could barely see without his glasses. Even in these later years, when adolescence and my university years have passed me by, I thought I was doomed to remain forever the weedy outcast, luckless with the ladies. Yes, friends, you may not think such a thing was possible now, but I had resigned myself to being just a humble, mild-mannered nerd who sought solace in his books and his few dear friends – but one fateful day, on a Wednesday around 4pm, in fact, all of that changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remembered that Internet favourite and former Star Trek alumni George Takei had released his own very pleasant-sounding fragrance on Amazon and I had a weekend with my friends planned in the trendy bars and clubs of London. I had been in the market for a new fragrance all week, to no avail. As my frustration grew, I took that fateful gamble on Takei’s foray into perfumery and ordered a bottle, from distant America. I thought that I had paid through the nose for shipping and packaging from so very far away, but I was wrong. Reader, let me assure you right away that no price on Earth could ever be too great for what was contained in that unassuming brown sleeve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a Saturday night, just around 6pm when everything changed. There I was, in my bathroom, in my best smart-casual efforts of a burgundy red dress shirt, jeans and smart shoes. Just my contact lenses now, and a spray of the bottle of Eau My stood on my counter, and I would be ready. Then it happened. Behind me, as the news droned on about some economic crisis or another in my living room, through some kind of osmosis or telepathy, the bottle of Eau My seemed to speak to me. Yes friends, like some ancient artefact of the gods themselves, that perfume that stood in its unassuming, quietly dignified way, like so many great men of the bridge on the Enterprise, reached out across the empty space between us and implored me to spray it before I did anything else. Not knowing what to expect, I extended a doubting hand towards the bottle, took it up towards my face and held it before me, looking at myself and the bottle in my mirror. Little could I have known that that was the last look I would ever take of myself as I was in those days. Before me, contained in that bottle was life, but not as I knew it. I took a deep breath, swallowed and let my finger press down on the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, nothing happened. The perfume’s pleasant musk of ginger, jasmine and mandarin zest simply settled on my jaw and made its home on my cheekbones. I began to think it might only be a pleasant compliment to a good night out when all of a sudden, as I inhaled it deeply, something gave way deep inside of everything I was. Like something had hooked my insides with a coat hanger and violently jerked them back, I felt myself swaying and lurching and buckling under the weight of something awesomely powerful. Shocked as this force writhed and bucked and burrowed deep inside, I violently jerked a hand out towards my sink, desperate for something to grab on to, only for my toothbrush jar to come crashing down into pieces on my bathroom floor. Staggering in a daze to my bedroom, I collapsed into darkness on my bed. I don’t know what happened. I must have been out cold, but when I woke up, I felt somehow...different. A quick check of my wristwatch confirmed that this transformation had taken place inside of twenty minutes. So it was that I took several trepid, careful baby-steps back towards my bathroom, hoping to glimpse myself in my mirror and find some answers to what I had experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader, you would not believe what I saw staring back at me in that glass. Where there had once been nothing but the scrawny kid who never got picked for his games team, there now stood a captain’s physique. My shoulders, once bony and flat, were now as broad and as powerful as the stern of the Enterprise herself. My biceps bulged with the power to lift a man twice my size and as I looked at my rippling abdominal muscles, I thought that Thor himself could not have bested me if it ever came to a cheese-grating contest between us. As the shock lifted the fog of sleep from me, the notion that I might have accidentally fallen asleep with my contact lenses still on held no fear and gave way to joy, for I realised I no longer needed them because I could now see with flawless 20:20 vision. This, after a lifetime of crippling ocular disability, of short-sightedness and corrective glasses and prescription contact lenses. I was cured! Truly, I stood amazed – but the awesome power of Takei’s miracle Eau My was not spent yet. No, friends, far from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still reeling in amazement, I went to turn on the tap, hoping a splash of cold water would bring me to my senses. With nothing but a feather touch, the cold, hard steel was buckled and crushed into tangled remnants. There was no time to be bewildered though, because at that moment, the television I had so carelessly left on blared with urgent breaking news. Coming to, I dashed into my living room, whole chunks of plaster and wood splintering into dust as I rammed the doorframe by accident to see the story unfold. The news cameras reeled in horror and a million voices seemed to cry out in terror as high above my beloved London’s Leicester Square, a vast Klingon warship laid waste to my city with particle beam canon fire and artillery bombardment from their antimatter warheads. On the ground, the foot-soldiers were slaughtering innocents by their hundreds, and the Odeon Cinema was consumed by belching black smoke and fire and screams as they made war upon the Earth. No mere Amazon review could ever truly convey the horror of it to you, friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looked like my night out was cancelled. At least in the conventional sense, for what had once been only a frivolous online novelty purchase to go out and pick up girls (and possibly some young gentlemen...) on the town with suddenly became so much more as I realised what I now had to do with the incredible power of Eau My. With a mere thought, I was through my roof and into the cold night air, flying through the clouds faster than the warp drive output on Scotty’s best day. In an instant, as the invading Klingon warlord cried out in victory looking down upon his destruction, I came in for a spectacular, earth-shaking three-point landing in the middle of the square. So great was the quake of the earth when I touched down, that even under Klingon bombardment, it seemed like all of London stopped still to pay attention as I rose to my feet to face down the invasion. In those moments, I locked eyes with the warlord at the head of his fleet and my voice seemed to carry itself booming across the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Stop this at once!” I cried, “And leave this planet, or so help me, I’ll stop this myself!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A moment of silence passed, as though tumbleweed might have blown by if this were the American Wild West, before the entire invasion fleet seemed to burst into peels of guttural laughter at my threats. In moments, though, the humour of my feeble protestations faded into over-boiling primal rage that I would dare to impugn their warriors’ honour, and  as if to prove their point, I was charged by several of the villains, who came at my with their spears and rifles like a swarm of enraged – although mildly entertained – hornets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they charged, either from some lost oblivion deep within my psyche, or else stirred into waking life by the power of Eau My, was the sudden absolute mastery of all forms of moQbara combat. I met the first blow with an almost casual resistance, holding out my left forearm and planting my feet as the sharp steel of a bat’leth tore through my shirt and gnawed at my arm. I met the Klingon’s attack with a return right hook to his jaw so powerful that it sent the villain flying three feet across the ground and tore him from his weapon, still embedded in my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulling the blade from my flesh, I was amazed to discover that the wound stitched itself back together without even the trace of a scar before my very eyes, when I primed the bat’leth for combat, holding it steady and standing ready in the middle of the invasion, daring any of the warriors to face me in honourable mano-a-mano fisticuffs. With their strict warrior code demanding they face me one-by-one, what followed was a violent ballet of vicious alien king-fu. As the hours wore on, the odds mounted so high against their forces – almost as high as I would leap into the air, dragging my Klingon opponent up with me in anticipation of a truly epic clothesline body-slam - that some even dared to fire on me from the sidelines with their anti-matter rifles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It was at these moments that I  stood in awe of myself as I realised what I been transformed into - I may have been wearing a red shirt, but the molecules of Takei’s perfume were somehow able to rearrange themselves in an instant, forming some kind of chemical cologne barrier around me powerful enough to repel Klingon weapon fire. The most savage heat-ray blasts at almost point-blank range bounced off of me like phaser fire from the Enterprise’s forward shields. It was all I could do to invite these code-disgracing felons to fight me one-to-one with whatever shred of dignity they had left, to spare them the humiliation of ritual suicide or execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the end of the night, I had laid waste to the entire Klingon invasion force single-handed, with bodies lying dead or out cold or exhausted all around me. Only the would-be warlord of these alien usurpers of my planetremained, who leapt down from his command post, alive with the all the impotent rage of his fallen army into an earth-shaking three-point landing of his own, charging at me at full speed, the tip of his bat’leth primed to run my right through. Ducking and dodging, and getting up to face him for another round, he roared a terrible, primal raw, charging me again – but this time, I was ready.&lt;br /&gt;Even as he put all of his mastery of the bat’leth against me, I blocked and dodged with the skill of the old Klingon masters, narrowly avoiding a sweeping arc through the air that would have taken off my head. As he was thrown off balance by the force of his swing, I mule-kicked him from a hand-stand position, sending him stumbling back, his weapon falling from his hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaping back onto my feet, I ran him down, so that even as he stood legs apart ready to tackle me like a man stopping a charging bull with his bare hands, I threw myself down into a body-slide between his legs – and in those moments, I got right up, brought him around to face my by his shoulder and punched him in the face. A few moments of stunned disbelief passed in his face, which steadily bruised before he collapsed, first onto his knees, then out cold, face down onto the tarmac of Leicester Square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around me, London seemed to erupt into cheers and adulation. Every news camera, helicopter and reporter for miles went ballistic with coverage of what had happened. The Mayor of London himself even ran up to me with the Prime Minister and both of them tried to pin every medal awarded in the British Army to my chest in a fit of grateful hysteria Rock-solid marriages of fifteen or more years and long partnerships were abandoned on the spot. Wives, husbands, boyfriends and girlfriends, girlfriends of girlfriends (oh my!) and boyfriends of boyfriends all dropped to their knees with desperate tears in their eyes like a reverse Mexican wave of lovesick agony, begging and pleading for my hand in marriage – but it was in those moments that I realised for certain what Eau My had turned me into – what I had become, and what I would be forever. Turning down medals and marriages and the media frenzy, and politely informing a panicked chap in a bow-tie who emerged from a blue box from 1963 that the crisis had been averted, I turned my back on the city and took off into the night air again. “I must go now,” I said to them, “but remember – it’s ok to be Takei.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live my life in the same quiet solitude in which it began, but now I do it as a different man. Wherever there is a threat from the stars emerging to attack the Earth, I will be there to defend it, and at my side will be that bottle of Eau My that changed my life forever. People of the Earth, I am not telling you to not buy this truly amazing product of perfumery. I am simply urging caution – for as everyone knows, with great power must come great responsibility and it must only be used it you are willing to boldly go where no man has gone before.</li>
    <li> Harcourt Fenton Mudd? Hardcore scent n studd!&lt;br /&gt;Over come all your trials and tribbilations with this out of this world man gift.</li>
    <li> You can not judge a smell by reading a review...... So my point is; Taki is so inspirational and goodhearted, it just makes you feel GOOD knowing that you carry his cheerful karma while wearing his perfume.  I mean really, God Bless him!</li>
    <li> It works.  Vader nailed a Wookie wearing this stuff.  He had to chew off his own arm in the process.</li>
    <li> I worked for a time at a Macy&#x27;s fragrance counter, a hazard of which was losing my sense of smell. There are only so many spritzes one can endure (by my count, 18,422,675) before the sensory cells in one&#x27;s nose go irreversibly numb. Or so I thought. One whiff of Eau My and my nasal passages opened like a flower in bloom. Suddenly, I could smell everything, including the cologne&#x27;s woody top note and a base note I can only describe as the partially decayed body of a tribble. I can even taste food again, provided I first douse it with a tablespoon of Eau My. Just be sure to have Poison Control on speed dial, as even a drop over a tablespoon generally results in projectile vomiting. The good part? I can taste it coming up as well as going down.</li>
    <li> Has a very crisp clean scent. Unisex. I will wear this as well. Reminds me of colognes I have purchased from The Gap. Not overly strong, and good for those jeans and t-shirt days.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift from my friend because we&#x27;re both Star Trek fans.  In that sense, it&#x27;s a wonderful gift.  But the fragrance itself is a disappointment.  It&#x27;s a standard-order aquatic cologne that&#x27;s very close to Acqua di Gio.  Keep that in mind if you&#x27;re seriously thinking of buying this to wear.</li>
    <li> I did not think I was going to be getting this item before Christmas, but alas... I did. Was able to give it as a gift to someone who really liked it alot!</li>
    <li> ***Caution*** When wearing this be prepared for endless Sunday wrestling with your significant other. Also causes a huge increase in musculature.</li>
    <li> As a long time fan of George Takei (I remember him having less then half a million of us) I expected from him nothing but the best. It is clearly much superior then Britney Spears Fragrance Collection. My thought is that with 5 million fans he should have (and could have) do much better then that.</li>
    <li> This is the shortest path to 100,000 likes on Facebook. Slather it on and enjoy the instant popularity on the world&#x27;s most popular social networking site.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the brightest candle on the cake, or the sharpest sword in the sword cabinet.  But I guess I am a little confused about the scent.  I thought Italian bergamot was an expensive car.  Why would anyone want to smell like that?  And vetiver?  Gonna have to google that one.  Sounds like a feminine spray.  In so far as the fresh ozone--does that mean we&#x27;ll replenish the ozone layer every time we spray?  But what about all the reviews that say after 3-4 sprays it was zombie apocalypse time?  That concerns me because I like to slather on cologne until my office-mate has a major asthmatic episode (he takes my office supplies without asking).  Anyway....I just want to smell like George.  Is that so wrong?</li>
    <li> Whether getting ready for Pon Farr or your cousin&#x27;s Bar Mitzva, slap some Sulu behind your ears and get ready for Shore Leave Where No Man Has Gone Before. Whether you&#x27;re looking for Amok Time or Naked time, the refreshing scent of Eau My will have your love interesting declaring, &amp;#34;For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky,&amp;#34; and fauning over you like you&#x27;re Elaan of Troyius. And if you know anyone looking for love, buying them a gift bottle will be an Errand of Mercy</li>
    <li> I purchased this product back in 1937. Although I expected the architecture of the scent to be more complex it was more reminiscent of Tori Amos&#x27; song &amp;#34;In the spring time of his voodoo&amp;#34;. Disappointment. No beaming up qualities but more to align with the gay rights movement. I must admit a quality is as a gay man, my fiance wants to attend more Gay Rights political movements after smelling me but it really gets in the way of our sunday scrabble nights.</li>
    <li> This fragrance will give you the roar of a lion, the sexual prowess of a tiger, and the hunger of a bear.</li>
    <li> Amazing and I know why it is called what it is, for those long nights feel free to spirits it on your Eau my just to be safe.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!! 60 percent of the time it works every time. I always have been and always will be your fan.</li>
    <li> Although I am an &amp;#34;Oklahoma Dad&amp;#34;, I fully expected this cologne to smell like my beloved alma mater, Georgia Tech.  Specifically, I expected it to smell like a combination of marijuana, vomit and horse urine.  Just imagine my surprise when I discovered that it actually smells like something that one would wear intentionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars for scent but only 1 star for false advertising.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll make you smell and feel fabulous. This alluring scent was created by by a man, for a man, to impress a (wo)man. One spray from this bottle you will develop that enchanting baritone voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Extended use of product may cause someone named Brad to hit on you repeatedly. When confronted that you are indeed not in fact Mr. Takei, he quietly responds with &amp;#34;It&#x27;s ok to be Takei.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep an eye out for his next fragrance, &amp;#34;Hel Eau&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I cut a dashing figure in my gold command tee&lt;br /&gt;My throttle fingers twitch with anticipated glee&lt;br /&gt;scotty&#x27;s down fixing up tech-gibberish in a tube&lt;br /&gt;uhura&#x27;s skirt is hiking, i&#x27;m glad I got some lube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;cause sulu&#x27;s gonna rock this joint, rock this joint, rock this joint&lt;br /&gt;and i choose which way the ship will point, ship will point, ship will point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got the con&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got the con&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got the con&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m rocking Eau My on...</li>
    <li> Initial application instills a sense of deadpan humor and dry wit. A second application turns you into a social media darling. Apply a third time and you&#x27;ll find yourself writing Broadway musicals. WARNING: Nobody has yet to survive the pure bliss that comes with a fourth application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: My acquaintance Bill wanted to write a one-star review but doesn&#x27;t have an account. Including it below ...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star. Doesn&#x27;t have my name on it.&lt;br /&gt;— William Shatner</li>
    <li> Having received Eau My for my birthday at the weekend (I guess it really is the perfect gift for the nerd in your life), I decided to wear it forthwith.  After leaving for work, it was immediately obvious that my fragrance was attracting attention.  However, as I was riding my motorbike at the time, this was perhaps not the best of circumstances to be pursued by masses of crazed people suffering from a pheromone induced psychosis!  Honestly, it was like a scene from &amp;#34;The Walking Dead&amp;#34;, but with less biting (although some may have occurred).  The fragrance is great, but &amp;#34;Set your phasers to stunning&amp;#34; is, maybe, an understatement.  As for my ride to work, well, I imagine I&#x27;ll be needing new leathers!  Eau my, indeed!!!</li>
    <li> I keep a bottle of Eau My in my purse for the instantaneous need for a Takei moment of happiness. Spread the Takei love.</li>
    <li> A fragrance so alluring that even a Vulcan will turn their head and raise and eyebrow in interest. It&#x27;s just that fascinating.</li>
    <li> Made with real bits of Takei, so you know it&#x27;s okay. I used to wear Sex Panther religiously, but after having wild, ravenous sex with anonymous women, I wanted to turn my life around. I thought I&#x27;d try Ea My.&lt;br /&gt;Boy, did life get awesome after that. Not only was I still having meaningless intercourse with countless women, but now seemingly heterosexual men were pursuing me romantically. Ea My is the equivalent of projectile Viagra (and chocolate unicorns for the ladies).&lt;br /&gt;I was camping in the woods with my newly formed harem, and no bull, bigfoot came out of the bushes and challenged me to a knife fight. I didn&#x27;t have a knife, but I did have my emergency spray bottle of Ea My. One spray on that liquid-garbage smelling behemoth, and six days later, he&#x27;s in a trailer park with a litter of children.</li>
    <li> It gave me the Shatners for a week. Annd I had the red shirts for a week after that. Thanks Georgie boy!</li>
    <li> Trekkie. Interweb addict. Senior citizen. Imagine these bodily aromas all in one bottle.  More sensational than bottled unicorn tears. Eau My!</li>
    <li> Some hottie on grindr recommended I give this a try; he seemed kind of nerdy but could do 100 push-ups at a time so I was down. It was great! The package was beautifully wrapped, the top (oh what a top!) had a nice grip, and the nozzle was perfection as I know it. With just the right amount of pressure I had spray all over my chest, my back, and neck. Didn&#x27;t even get any in my eye! It was a magical first encounter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and the cologne was nice, too.</li>
    <li> I sprayed some of this on me and now I look like John Cho!  What the heck George I thought this was the good stuff!!!</li>
    <li> So I bought this here smell good sauce cuz I love me some star wars. I took it out of the box thing it came in. My 16 year old (he&#x27;s in the secund grade now!) Tolt me I wuz stoopid.  He says that once you take email out of the box, they lose the value. So, I done put it back in the box and just rubbed the box on me. I still smell better than uncle dad!</li>
    <li> Scent is highly intoxicating.  Spice and Musk with just a hint of urine.  You will be definitely be remembered.  Uncle George will be pleased.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Stardate 9521.6. Captain&#x27;s Log, USS Excelsior. Hikaru Sulu commanding. After three years, I have concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.  Not one of them, however, smelled as amazing as Eau My!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Once you start wearing Eau My, your partner will be flying their starship apart to get to you.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I possess 99 troubles, none of which are Tribbles.&amp;#34;  Although, now that you smell as fresh as a Federation Commodore, all other lifeforms will be tremendously attracted to you.</li>
    <li> While this fragrance is pleasant, the sprayer on the bottle leaks and the expensive liquid runs out all over everything. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it until they improve the sprayer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that as a long time Takei fan I would have bought this even it ending up smelling like Horta dung, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it and found I enjoyed the bright citrus tones. Not too strong and with a balance of scents that makes me smile every time I put it on. It may not be the most unique or sophisticated perfume ever, but I think it&#x27;s quite wearable and the sense of humor behind it adds an extra splash of fun.</li>
    <li> First off, I never would have ordered this product on my own because I don&#x27;t trust George Takei. Due to a tragic family incident, we don&#x27;t trust anything coming from anybody who once played a robot on a science fiction television show (long story). But one of my childhood friends who remembers how worried I was when the aliens looking like sliced pizza hanging from the ceiling got Spock by sticking on his back... bought this for me. I was, after all, genuinely concerned for Spock. Especially after they pulled those ice cubes from his body. I was a little upset at first that my friend had betrayed our robot policy, but I put his gift on the mantle (as we do with all gifts) to show how much we value being given things from our friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few nights ago, I found myself pungent from a trip to the gym and in a rush to get out before my infant son spotted me and did his inevitable &#x27;give me a hug&#x27; gesture. Acting quickly, I spritzed a puff of Eau My under each arm and bolted out of there. I live a fast-paced life, and didn&#x27;t notice the smell until I cut off a line of cars while merging onto the interstate. It smelled pleasant, and complimented the classical music on the radio while diminishing the smell of fried plastic that comes from a little unexpected stress on the motor vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My colleagues were also interested in my new smell. I forgot the name and told them just to google the guy who played the robot in Star Track. They didn&#x27;t know who I was talking about, suggesting I meant to say Battlestar Galaxy or Buff Roger. Non-geeks simply have no clue sometimes.</li>
    <li> My wife got me this for Christmas. It&#x27;s a great fragrance. She loves it. The only reason for four stars vice five is how it also attracts lions, tigers, and bears! If you&#x27;re in a big city avoid zoos. If you&#x27;re in a rural area, consider yourself warned.</li>
    <li> While wearing this cologne, I was able to efficiently and smoothly parallel park a spaceship in rush hour traffic. That alone would make it good enough for me, however, as an added bonus I&#x27;m fairly certain the lovely androgynous smell is subtly working to close the wage gap every day that I wear it to work, which totally rocks. Also, the delightful scent lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The day after rain&lt;br /&gt;Warm air blowing a fresh scent&lt;br /&gt;Oh my it&#x27;s Eau Myyy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this cologne&lt;br /&gt;It worked almost too well&lt;br /&gt;Sprained my pelvis after</li>
    <li> Subtle, sexy, fun, just like Takei!</li>
    <li> I had to get this, being a long time fan.  My wife likes the scent, and looks askance at me when I wear it leaving the house.</li>
    <li> My husband was thrilled as he has always been a Trekie. He loves the smell as well as the fragrance.</li>
    <li> My teenage son smells like a Starfleet officer instead of an Axe commercial-what a relief. It&#x27;s very subtle and a good way to introduce a young person the concept of personal scent.Thanks George Takei!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter in law because she loves all things George Takei.  She loves the perfume! It was the perfect gift.</li>
    <li> A Perfect balance. Not too much but not too little. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but it was too cool to pass up ordering for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent.  I am so glad I purchased this.  I have worn much more expensive scents that did not wear nearly as cleanly as this.  If you have any doubts, push them aside and give this a try.</li>
    <li> Oh My, its Eau My. Fresh</li>
    <li> Was hesitant to buy a cologne I&#x27;d never sampled before but I really like George Takei so I took a gamble and it paid off. I came from using Adidas Dare to this and I will not be switching back. It smells sweet with a small hint of musk. I normally hate musky cologne but this just works.</li>
    <li> The scent is pleasant, but it is somewhere between a feminine and masculine scent.  It may not be for everyone unless you like a combination of scents or the novelty of it.</li>
    <li> Smells like something my grandmother would wear. I got it mainly as an off-beat Trek collectible.</li>
    <li> It made my ding dong move 3&amp;#34; to the left and i think a ball dropped an extra 2&amp;#34;.  Would have been 5 stars if the power cord was included rather than optional.  The battery version is great, but plug this stuff into the wall and its a party.</li>
    <li> I love the vulcan stuff. It vulcan rocks. I have vulced more since I purchased this than I ever imagined on vulcing before.  If you want a good solid product that&#x27;s smells vulcan incredible, this is your vulcan lucky day.</li>
    <li> This was fantastic.  I got it for my husband as a joke, because I thought it was funny.  THIS STUFF SMELLS AMAZING!!!!  Now it&#x27;s all he wears and I will keep getting this for him.</li>
    <li> Bad packaging, good scent. Put it in a different bottle or you&#x27;ll get a headache. Overall I&#x27;m happy I got it.</li>
    <li> Got a bottle as a gift.  It smells wonderful- not too manly, not too girly, (hubby and I both wear it) and best of all not overpowering.</li>
    <li> It smells great, very refreshing and pleasant. However, it fades quick, about an hour after applying it you can&#x27;t even tell it was used.</li>
    <li> Georgie strikes gold again.  After an intense wrestling session with Bradders, nothing cleans me up better than some Eau My.</li>
    <li> Eau My... so predictable that if George was to come out with a fragrance, it would be named like this. However, the content is strikingly not so predictable. Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Sulu experienced in \\&quot;The Naked Time\\&quot;, Eau My induces a bit of perspiration a few minutes after application.  As you rub and massage your hands with the increasing moisture, there&#x27;s a peculiar nervousness that begins to well within you. But wait... wait for the dry down--it&#x27;s only moments away. Because once it begins, your nerves simmer down into serene smoothness. At this point, you&#x27;ll feel a little giddy but increasingly empowered. You&#x27;ll have this irresistible urge to leap up and get something done, no matter what it is. Eau My Empowered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Bull may give you wings, but Eau My gives you the power to flap them endlessly!  Just be prepared not to keep your shirt on.</li>
    <li> Are you a run down, shell of a man or lady?  Spritz some of uncle George&#x27;s smelly spray on you and become a unicorn amongst mere wildebeests.  I haven&#x27;t even purchased it and yet I&#x27;m oozing the musk of manly men back from working the mines just thinking about it.  There are so few things in life that make you a sex god in the eye of whomever you prefer.  If you&#x27;re a dude into dudes, well this will make you feel better than a bear hug from bob Vila.  If you enjoy the ladies, you&#x27;ll be wondering how you survived going to bars without this liquid stun gun.  If you like the ladies and you also happen to be one, well you&#x27;ll enjoy it&#x27;s top notes of nosetingling citrusy smelly goodness.&lt;br /&gt;Always spray carefully as seven Mr. Spock couldn&#x27;t reason his way out of trying to passionately embrace you.</li>
    <li> If you are sick of stinking like a klingon, this is definitely the cologne for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I notice the scent seems to make my tribbles tremble...</li>
    <li> The Stern Superfan Love George and I love the cologne .... Eau My all the way!!!!!! Superfans 4 Life!! Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my fiance.  I had some confusion caused by the Amazon page.  It said it wouldn&#x27;t arrive until after Christmas, but I was okay with that.  Then my order page had an estimated delivery range that went all the way to the end of January and I got nervous!  Shortly after that, I came back to the page and it then said I could order the product with regular shipping and it would arrive before December 24.  Huh???  I followed this page over that week and it kept changing back and forth between saying it would arrive after Christmas and it would arrive before.  Eventually I reached out to both Amazon and Tru Fragrance about it.  Tru Fragrance got back to me and assured me it would be shipping soon.  I don&#x27;t know whether the confusion on the page is the fault of Amazon of Tru Fragrance and Beauty, LLC but I hope it has been fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received it in the mail today, well before Christmas after all!.  It is a gift for my fiance, but I took it out and sprayed it to make sure I wasn&#x27;t giving him a cologne that actually smelled terrible.  It smells wonderful.  They describe it as unisex, but honestly I think it definitely smells like men&#x27;s cologne.  I don&#x27;t have a particularly sophisticated sense of smell so I can&#x27;t describe it specifically, but I will say it smells light and fresh and very nice.  The bottle is lovely and it sprayed easily.  The smell lingers nicely but is not overwhelming.  I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> The greatest cologne ever! Wearing this will guarantee you getting laid more often than James T. Kirk in his prime.</li>
    <li> Because my alien lovers deserve the very best, I only use &amp;#34;Eau My&amp;#34; - I wear this and nothing else......oh myyyyy!!</li>
    <li> Eau My God this stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;ve been using Eau My for about 3 months now, and my life has taken a turn for the better.  My confidence has increased 10-fold, my abs have become ripped, and my gluts now shine with the light of a thousand suns, EVEN WHEN I&#x27;M WEARING PANTS!  I don&#x27;t know why I ever used other products.  Maybe it&#x27;s because Eau My hasn&#x27;t been around that long, or maybe it&#x27;s because Eau My has increased my IQ by 20 points.  Whatever the case, Eau My is amazing.  The only downside is that once you start using it, you&#x27;ll have to start ordering by the case, which will put a hurtin&#x27; on your wallet.  I ended up having to sell my car, my house, my TV, my wife, and my kids just to be able to afford this magical nectar.  Do I regret it?  Hell no!  This has been the best 3 months of my life.  By this product.  Seriously.  It will Eaupen your eyes.</li>
    <li> I waited until the weekend arrives to try this scent, although I did unpackage the bottle straight away. I love the look of it, and keep on my dresser where I can see it without having to open the little mirrored door behind which I keep my other scents.&lt;br /&gt;I succumbed Friday after my evening shower, applying two light sprays. Within five minutes, I began to feel like a real man. I firmly believe that &#x27;Eau My&#x27; is the only reason I woke up with a real man Sunday morning with no recollection of events since friday night began.&lt;br /&gt;My wife wants me to destroy the bottle, but I don&#x27;t know...</li>
    <li> Made  with  the  finest  tribble  musk  and  aged  to  perfection,  you  will  be  smelling  better  than  any  star  fleet  officer  ever  did.</li>
    <li> Weather he is fresh from the shower or planning an evening of wining and dining, the only thing left when he&#x27;s taken everything off is Eau My!</li>
    <li> It is not often that my husband and I can agree on how we should smell. I mean, how am I supposed to find him in the deepest parts of space unless I have a matching scent to home in on. We also use a little spritz on our cruiser, that way we are able to remember where we park. The only issue we seem to be having is that we are constantly being chased by Samurai!  Otherwise, we are uber content with our scent!</li>
    <li> Looking for a gift to beam your boyfriend to aromatic heaven!? Look no further, GT&#x27;s Eau My is the most scentual gift you can give a loved one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the red shirt off your love life. Keep your man smelling like Eau My, and you&#x27;ll always have access to the Captain&#x27;s Quarters - no hollodeck necessary.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t even go into a space where there is cologne. But after trekking across town looking for the perfect gift for my tribblesome best friend I came across a bottle of Eau My. I was stunned as the salesman Scotty sprayed it on me. I suddenly had an overwhelming feeling to put on a red shirt. It shook me to my Bones. And unlike other colognes it&#x27;s fragrance didn&#x27;t fade it seemed to Klingon to me no matter what! I tell you I was in Spock at how fast others were affected by the scent of Eau My. I bought a bottle and went to the Enterprise club and for once I didn&#x27;t leave Sulu!! I met this wonderful guy named J.T. he&#x27;s a Captain!!! Even though I had never considered men as an alternative I&#x27;m telling you the things that man did to me left me Shatnered. Thanks to Eau My J.T. boldly went where no man had gone before!!!</li>
    <li> I have always wondered what it would be like to smell like a trekkie. I imagined it might be a cross between old cheese and desperation. I was so pleased to discover it is a delightful smell. Imagine all of those loving Trekkies I passed up in fear of their reeking of desperation! Never again will I turn my nose up (or plug it). I will boldy go where no woman has gone before bearing a bottle of Eau My and an open heart.</li>
    <li> So I said \\&quot;hey! Anyone can mix up a brew that will freshen you up to instant, punning sexiness\\&quot;.  I first stole a whiff off of the original scent, at a book signing. Sorry mr. Sulu, that loud snorting vacuum cleaner you heard behind your neck was me.&lt;br /&gt;I had no other choice, I needed the original scent so I had to Takeit from him.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately analyzed the fragrances: almonds, musky grammar books, torn shirts and the ashes of a fencing champion. Easy ingredients. I then paraded sexily in front of the potion to arouse its attention before shouting \\&quot;KHAAAAN!\\&quot; a few times at it. It was ready, I smelled it.  It made me say  \\&quot;Eau Nose\\&quot;. Close, but no cigar.&lt;br /&gt;I added some Bram Stoker and got \\&quot;Eau de Twilight\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I minced in pictures of Ru Paul, Elton John and Ellen Degenres and got a whiff of \\&quot;Pure Homo\\&quot; instead.&lt;br /&gt;I got silly at this point, I minced a whole realtor in, hoping to bring the experiment to higher ground but I failed once more.&lt;br /&gt;I got \\&quot;Eau de to let\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I give up.  If you want a perfume that&#x27;ll make you say \\&quot;Eau Myyyy!\\&quot; The only way is to buy it. I tried ten different brews to reach the same punny effect.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, no pun in ten did.</li>
    <li> Even if you bought this for kicks, (or thought it was a love potion and it didn&#x27;t work) this smell is still perfect for your daily needs. Need to go pilot a starship? Spice things up with this scent, just splash some on and you&#x27;ll feel 100% manlier and more prepared to go kick butt on an intergalactic mission. Need to go get groceries? This scent can make anything exciting and smell of adventure, and lazer burn. Now what&#x27;re you still doing here? You have a planet to save! (Or errands to run, both equally exciting)</li>
    <li> A new scent from the Cologne Ranger himself, George Takei. Like its maker, it&#x27;s assertive without being arrogant, with just a hint of sassy. Right after I received my bottle, I applied some and took off to the local mall to complete my holiday shopping. As I finished up, I enteredthe glass elevator to go down from the third floor of the mall, as a young, beautiful woman gets into the elevator, smelling of expensive perfume. She turns to the me and says arrogantly, &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34; by Ralph Lauren, $150 an ounce!&amp;#34;, sniffs condescendingly and winces. Suddenly, another young and beautiful woman gets on the elevator, and also very arrogantly turns to me and snipes, &amp;#34;Chanel No. 5, $250 an ounce!&amp;#34; When we reached our destination, about to get off the elevator, I looked both beautiful women in the eye, bent over, farted and quipped, &amp;#34;Broccoli - 49 cents a pound.&amp;#34; Ohhh Myyy</li>
    <li> Tired of Voyaging around Sulu on those long Treks into Deep Space 9?&lt;br /&gt;Khan&#x27;t seem to figure out what matters and what anti-matters?&lt;br /&gt;Warp over to your bathroom counter and put on some Eau My, and you&#x27;ll feel like beaming out to enjoy Andorian Brandy, Plomeek Soup, and some really tasty Gagh with those pesky red shirts, before sending them off an a suicide... er, an away team.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for our anniversary. As soon as my husband put Eau My on, something happened to him. He started walking differently, talking differently. Every time I tried to get near him, he would smile and kinda dance away. And then he appeared with no shirt on and he had the broom handle like a sword challenging me to a duel! Really?&lt;br /&gt;All I wanted was a romantic evening. What I got was a night of my husband smelling sexy as hell and looking wonderful in the tight pants he had on. I had to get some champagne in him to, shall we say, get him under control?&lt;br /&gt;A good night was had by all, finally. And he stills smells wonderful! Thank you &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is a must for that special someone, it has a strong fragrance of leather and candle wax with subtle undertones of amyl nitrate and latex.</li>
    <li> As a person who adores unisex fragrances, I felt I must immediately try Eau My.  Get out of town, CK One...Eau My has stolen my heart!  Instantly, I transcend into a sexy ass bitch who&#x27;s not attempting to overcompensate by smelling like a cheap hooker, with perfume purchased at CVS. Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, I get my smell well from Amazon, people!  George obviously knows sexy.  I mean, look at the guy.  He&#x27;s got men and women pining for him.  Does that tell you anything?  It tells me that this man, this delicious man must smell absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look.  You can be sexy without really trying if you smell nice.  It&#x27;s up to you.  For $39.99 it&#x27;s worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate it, you can at least use it to spray that funk out of your crotch when you can&#x27;t remember how long it&#x27;s been since you&#x27;ve showered. Yeah, you Stinky McStinkerson.  Hit up those armpits too.</li>
    <li> Recently while in the city, I had the misfortune to lose my wallet and, only having change, was forced to ride the subway.  Between the panhandlers and scary looking teenagers, I found myself pushed up against a young man who had doused himself in one of those godawful spray on deodorant colognes.  You know the one I mean...the popular one that can be found to fog most of the hallways of any junior high school in America today.  Anyway, after two stops of suffering with the smell of teen spirit next to me, I pulled out the bottle of Eau My I had hidden deep in my coat pocket as I meant this as a gift for a dear family member.  Deciding that the salvation of my olfactory nerves trumped family loyalty, I snuck a spritz onto the wayward chap.  The change was absolutely instantaneous.  It was like standing next to Mr. George Takei himself...suave and debonair, a delight to all five senses and I had to fight an overwhelming urge not to pull this young man out at the next stop and show him what &amp;#34;Warp speed ahead Mr. Sulu&amp;#34; really means.  Thank you, Mr. Takei, for creating a scent that transports the wearer (and the sniffer nearby) to a delicious galaxy far, far away.</li>
    <li> The sensual smell of &amp;#34;Eau my&amp;#34; makes me want to say oh yes.......oh yes to love, to life, to amour!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already drunk the entire bottle and I&#x27;m still thirsty. I bet this wouldn&#x27;t have happened if James Doohan had created a fragrance.</li>
    <li> Eauuuuuu Myyyyyyyyyyyyy (He utters as the swarm of depraved, sexually charged and mentally unstable Orions comes charging towards him with reckless abandon.)</li>
    <li> Lets be honest, most celebrity perfumes are more likely to get responses like, &amp;#34;Oh my god what is that smell...&amp;#34; and  a rapidly clearing room. Yet Geoge Takei is known for quality and the reviews were good so I decided to take the leap and boldly go where only a few others had gone before. I was pleasantly surprised and rather pleased  when the misses left me saying, &amp;#34;ohhh myyy&amp;#34; after she smelled it on me.</li>
    <li> For the classy man or women who has decided to try and be hip for the night. Are they still trying to be hip or is it krunk I can&#x27;t keep up with these young people and their slang. Wait what was I doing. A review or something. What&#x27;s in this stuff. I&#x27;m 25 I shouldn&#x27;t be having memory problems. Wait I&#x27;m being told that I&#x27;m not 25. Anyway it smells good.</li>
    <li> The moment I spritzed this on, my shirt flew off and a sword appeared in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, that was a little alarming, but I took it in stride. I had expected big things from this cologne and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I knew I was flying a Starship to work. I admit, that took a little getting used to. I got the finger from a LOT of other drivers as they bounced off my forward shields. I think they were just jealous and upset that their fenders were dented and my hull was still pristine and gleaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I swash-buckled my way through my workplace, things got a little more strange. The flirting and the seductive looks from my co-workers was one thing, but I had thirty eight marriage proposals from both men and women by lunch time. That sword came in handy more than once, and though I didn&#x27;t actually injure anyone, I did leave a stylized &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; in the seat of many pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to change my name to something that starts with &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, it was a little unsettling at first, but now that I have been wearing the cologne for a couple of weeks, I have accepted and even come to love my new lifestyle. I am in rehearsals now for a new musical, and I have somehow become the most quoted person on facebook with well over 3 million likes, many from people I don&#x27;t know all that well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creeeepy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am well and truly satisfied with the product, and I am happy with my new life. The only real drawback is that my permanently shirtless nipples have been rock hard for 15 days and nights straight, but this too is something I believe I can get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to more amazing products from this company!!!</li>
    <li> Take&amp;#34;i&amp;#34; a chance on this scent for the OH MYY!!! night of your life,and wake up still smelling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> One spray and I let my Husband go where no man has gone before! Ba Ba Bouy! Ba Ba Bouy</li>
    <li> Okay....I admit it.....I bought the cologne as a gag gift for my nerdy Star-Trek fanatic fiancé.  Turns out the joke&#x27;s on me!  I received the bottle while at work (Heaven forbid I have I shipped to the house where my dog would be lounging around smelling like Mr. Takei!) and had my GBF see what he thought of it.  He had to give it a quick squirt and that&#x27;s all it took.  I almost ripped the unfortunate Christmas sweater he was wearing off his body just so I could lick his skin.  Now I&#x27;m beginning to wonder what is going to happen when my intended wears it.  I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll stand a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell!  And neither will I.  Oh my!</li>
    <li> Warning excessive use of this cologne will lead you into a multitude of consensual sexcapades resulting in severe fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a regular Tuesday night when i applied my Eau My 1.7-oz Cologne Spray, before heading to wal mart to pick up some tuscan whole milk. Immediately after donning my three wolf moon t shirt I felt a strange pulling sensation. As it turns out I was being beamed aboard the Enterprise. Apparently they were scanning for sexy and the pheromones in my new cologne was off the charts. I was needed for a vital mission to save the universe.  The captain himself needed me to take some &amp;#34;dictation&amp;#34; for the &amp;#34;captain&#x27;s log&amp;#34;  and boldly go where no man has gone before. I wasn&#x27;t really sure what that all meant but I figured when in Rome. Long story short never trust William Shatner.  This stuff is like magic, 60% of the time it works every-time.</li>
    <li> I put some on and 50 busty women trampled me.  I was in the hospital for five days.  But the upcoming lawsuit will give me enough to live,  and it will only cost a very, very small fraction of the Takai net worth.  He&#x27;s worth trillions, you know.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is both whimsical and magical.  I imagine this is what a unicorn would smell like.  Eau My is heavenly.</li>
    <li> Not a few weeks ago I was broke, addicted to all the heavy drugs, homophobic, not a fan of musicals or Star Trek, fat, and smelled horribly. One day I found a bottle of Eau My lying on the street and thought I could take a hit off it, instead I accidentally spilled it all over myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within days my problems melted away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I was offered a job for smelling good, and was payed handsomely for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly my addictions to the heavy stuff melted away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suddenly realized how much of a bigot I was being and realized LGBT people are just like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, DAMN is George Takei quite attractive all of a sudden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suddenly became a fan of musicals, and even fell in love with Star Trek, mind you only the ones with that Sulu fellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also dropped 200 pounds, as in it just fell off me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first I thought I was dying, turns out Eau My gives you mutant healing abilities as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel I am a model citizen now. Thanks Eau My!!!!</li>
    <li> The refreshing scent takes you away to beautiful alien worlds with strange but familiar vistas. This is no ordinary fragrance. This is for those who wish to be adventurous, wish to be spontaneous, wish to be stunning! All eyes and maybe more will focus on you when you step into the room. We all have at least a little Takei in us. Why not carry some of his essence on us. Sinking in to us. Penetrating our bodies, minds, and senses. Oh Myy! Is it hot in here or is it just me?</li>
    <li> For years i have been searching for just the right way to make my husband smell like an aging, gay, asian man. Dousing him in soy sauce? No, that just attracted cats. Lowering the seats in our car, telling him to drive slow, and sprinkling him with glitter? No, that just got him arrested.  Finally, we have the answer,.&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is everything you could or would expect. Its relevant, its attractive, and it drives the ladies crazy. Or, if you prefer, the men. This cologne does not judge.</li>
    <li> This scent reminds me of childhood wonder and magical adventures with just a hint of disappointment. Like the time when I went to the zoo but there was only a dog there. It was a shih tzu.</li>
    <li> After wearing the product, I was immediately assimilated by the Borg! My fragrance and inscentivness has adapted to service perfection. I guess resistance is futile.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest scent I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s pretty subtle and doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a few hours at most, but it&#x27;s a nice compliment to other things I do and is very clean.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas last year, had to get it when I found out who it was made by.  I smells wonderful!  Not too strong and not too light, just the right mixture of Eau My :-)  Geeks gay and straight will love this.</li>
    <li> Everyone i walk by just keeps turning around and saying &amp;#34;Ohhh Myyy&amp;#34; just like George, even my girlfriend&#x27;s dogs... It&#x27;s starting to creep me out! Thanks a lot George!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed after receiving this &#x27;cologne&#x27; if you can call it that. It&#x27;s far from flattering and might I suggest some cheaper solutions for you if this is the smell you fancy...&lt;br /&gt;- roll in a pig pen&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t wash for several weeks&lt;br /&gt;- when walking your dog don&#x27;t throw the poop away simply dab it behind your ears and pop the rest in your pocket&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend this abomination, simply terrible!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would turn me gay, but it didn&#x27;t work.  I went through a entire bottle before going to the gay bar and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> got this for my husband and he likes it I think it smells nice strong when it is first put on but gets better with wearing off a little</li>
    <li> The scent is pleasing, flattering, subtle and not overpowering while still being noticeable. Would absolutely buy this again, and not just because I have a lot of respect for George Takei.</li>
    <li> Beamed me up a bottle of Takei&#x27;s warp speed inspired cologne and  Red, aka Captain Janeway, was on me like the illusive chicken at Litchfield Federal Penitentiary yard. I am very pleased with the results as being a more mature woman, I didn&#x27;t want the attentions of the younger less experienced inmates. Needless to say, Red and I are making eye contact and I am sure to only complement all the meals Red serves. Back rub Red? Cologne me Fabulous...Thanks George. Oh and the Tribble mits work wonders ;)</li>
    <li> Eau My has a light citrus smell. My wife and I think it smells great!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from the most wonderful man in the world. I was a little weary that it might not be a quality product as it is clearly a bit of fun with Mr. Takei&#x27;s signature expression, but it&#x27;s a decent perfume and has a pleasant scent. It could stand alone without George&#x27;s endorsement but it&#x27;s so much more awesome with it.</li>
    <li> This is actually the first cologne my husband would actually wear! It smells wonderful, is truly unisex, and comes from a great man!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim, because of the meme. Luca Turin hadn&#x27;t reviewed it yet, so I was skeptical, and the midgets and naysayers on Bassnotes.com all eschewed it, but I&#x27;ve found that I really like it, and more to the point, everyone else seems to like it on me as well. My boss said &amp;#34;You smell really nice. Oops...I mean...I don&#x27;t mean to offend you...&amp;#34; I&#x27;m the man that can&#x27;t be offended - I was very flattered and glad for the cologne. Well done, Mr. Takei.</li>
    <li> As others have said, some of the reviews have been very witty, but I too am at a loss for such repartee and avoir de l&#x27;humour, all I can add is that this is the nicest fragrance I&#x27;ve found in a long time and I&#x27;m on my SECOND bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good test for a fragrance is, if you put it on, can smell it, but the smell goes away in 15 to you but other still smell it; THAT&#x27;S A GOOD FRAGRANCE FOR YOU!  I found my fragrance!  Thank you George!</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars, only because I wouldn&#x27;t dare dream of giving anything less to George Takei.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, to be honest with you, it doesn&#x27;t really smell that good. Sorry George!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still buy more if it ever runs out. Anything called Eau My is worth it.</li>
    <li> Aside from all the jokes, this cologne smells great! The only thing that I even could complain about is that it slightly leans more towards a manly fragrance. Although I&#x27;m not complaining, since it could still be used for men and women just fine.</li>
    <li> I got this as a huge fan of George Takei, I decided to be brave and give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I was fairly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Not to say this is a BAD cologne, by any means. But there&#x27;s just nothing... special or notable about it. It&#x27;s a very clean, crisp scent. But nothing quite jumps out to me about it, it isn&#x27;t really all that captivating so much as it is a cleansing note. If I had to compare it similarly, it would be to Nautica&#x27;s &amp;#34;White Sail&amp;#34; I suppose, but even White Sail is more memorable than this fragrance. I suppose it&#x27;s another case of &amp;#34;lower the standard, raise the average&amp;#34; here.</li>
    <li> Put it on once and William Shatner punched me in the face. Thanks George!</li>
    <li> As an unnamed red-shirt wearing crew member, I sprayed Eau My before beaming into unexplored territory and I&#x27;m still alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said.</li>
    <li> one of the finest men&#x27;s cologne on the planet.  I wish this came in larger sizes !!  Would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> My life was terrible before I started using this. I was ignored and ostracized and cast out by everyone. Now? I&#x27;m always happy. People love me. I got a raise at work. My phone doesn&#x27;t stop ringing. I think my penis grew a few inches. Highly recommend. I&#x27;m not a religious man, but if there&#x27;s a God, he or she totally uses this.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and says he would love to have it in a gallon size.</li>
    <li> My daily Cologne.  Fresh and fun. Lemon and spice it is second to none of the unisex scents.</li>
</ol>
