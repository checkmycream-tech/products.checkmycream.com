      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>The results, price, and ease of use is excellent.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent razor.  </li>
      <li>The tripple blades and lubricant strips are also very good.  </li>
      <li>It has a good grip and an excellent result!</li>
      <li>Its great for a beginner as well.</li>
      <li>Great Product from Gillette.</li>
      <li>Nice handle, pivoting blade is great!</li>
      <li>This is a great razor.</li>
      <li>Great for legs.</li>
      <li>It works great and as advertised.</li>
      <li>A good razor for people who don&#x27;t like disposable razors.</li>
      <li>She couldn&#x27;t find this at a good price in stores</li>
      <li>I tried this razor after the orginal Venus and originally loved it.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, it works good.</li>
      <li>You would think that a company that specializes in making razors would make a good one, but</li>
      <li>I have been using Venus Embrace and loved the close shave it provides, however - Venus Divine does not perform as well and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
      <li>This is a very good product, has a good performance, nice size and very easy to install on the wall.</li>
      <li>She loves it and is very glad that she has it</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>My favorite razors!</li>
      <li>Love, as always!</li>
      <li>Good price love this razor.</li>
      <li>Is there some kind of monopoly fixing the prices of razors?</li>
      <li>This is by far the best razor I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This would avoid the head piece from removing itself from the handle while using this product, which is very important.  </li>
      <li>I really think this is a great product.</li>
      <li>Think its okay, prefer the gilettes with the soap</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love them.</li>
      <li>Nice and great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Works very well, great value for the money.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>, I love them</li>
      <li>I love the blades and the closeness of the shave.  </li>
      <li>Love this razor.  </li>
      <li>While I normally love Venus razors this one is not the quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many razors but this is definitely the best i&#x27;ve used yet</li>
      <li>Nice clean shave</li>
      <li>prefer the original Venus better</li>
      <li>My legs and other parts feel great after I use this razor!</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
      <li>Its so easy to use.</li>
      <li>Not as good as some other Venus razors, but still good.</li>
      <li>So I bought one of these for my girlfriend and admittedly the first one she dropped and it broke very easily.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the Venus Gillette razors, but this one is garbage.  </li>
      <li>Smooth shave.</li>
      <li>My legs are always smooth after using this razor.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of those moisturizing strips, but to be honest I don&#x27;t think those do anything anyway.  </li>
      <li>but it feels like a cheap disposable, misses spots everywhere.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased several razors in the Gilette Venus line and have been fairly happy with all of them.  </li>
      <li>I used the original Venus razor for years, but lost it, so I decided to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; to the Venus Divine...and I&#x27;ve regretted it ever since.  </li>
      <li>It is sealed extremely tight, once you place it on top of the handle, which is great.  </li>
      <li>I recently purchased and opened the Gillette Venus Divine Sensitive razor and was doubly impressed with the precision of the razor, the ease of use, and the effectiveness of the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Venus Divine razor is fantastic, and not to mention a gorgeous shade of blue.</li>
      <li>Great deal they work very well easy to open packages and to change out the blades.</li>
      <li>Love the Venus, very close shave, no nicking and no stubble.</li>
      <li>But overall it is still of good quality.</li>
      <li>Neither she nor I will ever buy any other razor, lol.</li>
      <li>This is one of the older versions and doesn&#x27;t have as many razor blades per cartridge as some of the others.  </li>
      <li>Not sure what happened with this version of these typically very good razors</li>
      <li>First time I used it I cut myself because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to shave so close!</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this to, but it&#x27;s a good razor I&#x27;ve had for years that has never let me down, and I love the color.</li>
      <li>I had never used this type razor before and it is definitely worth the cost.</li>
      <li>but this is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>The handle design is just right, the pivoting head is designed to glide over your skin.  </li>
      <li>First, I was impressed with the packaging, and I did not review earlier because I was using other razors sets that I was not finish using at the time.</li>
      <li>Anyway, if you have fairly sensitive skin, not only are &amp;#34;women&#x27;s&amp;#34; razors a better choice, but this one is better than the others.</li>
      <li>Something extra great about it: you can wash stuck hair out from the back of the blade too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the best at shaving, I usually look like I&#x27;ve gone ten rounds with a dull razor and lost, but these are fabulous for getting a nice smooth shave without slicing and dicing myself to bits.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s my first razor</li>
      <li>(My favorite color is blue).</li>
      <li>At the low price, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, no matter how many razors I have.</li>
      <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to order different blades :)</li>
      <li>I received this direct from Gillette originally as a trail product at no cost</li>
      <li>I have owned the original Venus razor (the light tealish one) for close to 15 years now, and I finally said to myself, I want a new razor.</li>
      <li>It works well, and the blades give you a nice clean close shave without tearing up your skin, something that I often found hard to find in razors.</li>
      <li>The blades are strong and last me almost a month for just one interchangeable blade head.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Pivots nicely, reasonable refill prices too.</li>
      <li>Finally found a razor that doesn&#x27;t cut me and has a really smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>These work really well with no nicks</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>I am sure this one will last me another 15 years, and of course works just as well as my old one.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t cut you easily, the razors last a long time and they are comfortable to hold.  </li>
      <li>no nicks is very well for my very sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>The cartridges are also pretty expensive - depending on the prices you find, it&#x27;s sometimes more worthwhile to just buy a whole new razor instead of refills.</li>
      <li>My husband needed a new razor and when I asked which one he wanted me to order on Amazon he said &#x27;I don&#x27;t care&#x27;!</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this product, and will definitely purchase this product in the future.  </li>
      <li>Actually, as a mother&#x27;s day gift, I finally got my mother, who would only use disposables for 30 years, to finally switch to a Venus, and she is in love!!</li>
      <li>my new Venus Divine did not do well at all for me...</li>
      <li>One of my women friendsneeded a new razor for her legs.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually still using the first razor I bought maybe 10 years ago, just buying new blades.</li>
      <li>Even with a brand new razor head, it consistently pulls hair instead of actually shaving it.  </li>
      <li>The orginal Venus had hard plastic that went from top to bottom.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased so many women&#x27;s razors, sometimes it is hard to keep up with all the brand names and types of razors.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> prefer the original Venus better</li>
    <li> Think its okay, prefer the gilettes with the soap</li>
    <li> had to use old razor to finish shaving...my new Venus Divine did not do well at all for me...very disappointed after paying the price.</li>
    <li> I used the original Venus razor for years, but lost it, so I decided to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; to the Venus Divine...and I&#x27;ve regretted it ever since.  Even with a brand new razor head, it consistently pulls hair instead of actually shaving it.  Even then, what little parts do feel shaved, are completely raw with razor burn.  I&#x27;ve used it through 3 brand new razor heads, figuring maybe the first one I used was defective, but it&#x27;s been bad with all three and I&#x27;m finally done with this product.  It&#x27;s going in the trash and I&#x27;ll be purchasing a different brand.</li>
    <li> I tried this razor after the orginal Venus and originally loved it.  But, I&#x27;ve gone through 2 of these razors in the past several months.  I love the blades and the closeness of the shave.  But, I have discovered that it has a serious design flaw that the orginal didn&#x27;t have.  Both of my razors broke in the middle of the handle.  The orginal Venus had hard plastic that went from top to bottom.  The Divine has hard plastic that goes a couple inches down from the top and then it stops and has a rubber piece that comes up from the bottom.  Then has a few more inches of the hard plastic.  Both of the razors that I had broke right in the middle where the hard plastic was missing.  It is very disappointing, but I will not be buying this razor again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  I would look in your weekly coupons for a coupon and buy it from Wal Mart and you may come out a bit cheaper.  I bought it through Amazon since saving 50 cents at Walmart was not that big of a deal.  The blades don&#x27;t leave any nicks or cuts.  I&#x27;m getting about one month of use out ot the cartridges.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my first razor so I can&#x27;t compare it with the others. Anyway, it works good. But I just found the price was the same as BigY after I had ordered it.</li>
    <li> So I bought one of these for my girlfriend and admittedly the first one she dropped and it broke very easily.  Still had plenty of blades though so I purchased another, and after a few weeks it broke without any sort of damage done to it. We still have a bunch of blades for it though, so do I buy another one so she can finish using the blades, or do we buy a different razor that won&#x27;t just break after a few weeks.  So I do not recommend this purchase unless you feel like being trapped in a similar situation where you have blades but no handle for them to go on.  Extremely poor design.  You would think that a company that specializes in making razors would make a good one, but no. Is it possible they want you to be caught in this trap, I think so.</li>
    <li> These work really well with no nicks, I love them</li>
    <li> Love, as always! My favorite razors!</li>
    <li> Works really well. The blades are strong and last me almost a month for just one interchangeable blade head. This is worth the price considering how much other female disposable razors cost anymore. I really like this.</li>
    <li> Waste of money and took forever to get.</li>
    <li> what can you say about perfection?</li>
    <li> okay but the blades don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I have been using Venus Embrace and loved the close shave it provides, however - Venus Divine does not perform as well and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. In addition it has scratched and irritated my skin. I am not a fan!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus Divine for years. I&#x27;m actually still using the first razor I bought maybe 10 years ago, just buying new blades. My husband needed a new razor and when I asked which one he wanted me to order on Amazon he said &#x27;I don&#x27;t care&#x27;! So I bought him this one, and he likes it. Now I don&#x27;t have to order different blades :)</li>
    <li> Not as good as some other Venus razors, but still good.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever used. Nice handle, pivoting blade is great! First time I used it I cut myself because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to shave so close! But it&#x27;s really easy to use. Something extra great about it: you can wash stuck hair out from the back of the blade too! Even thick, heavy hair washes off of the blade easily. Try it; it&#x27;s a great razor!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used! I was not going to get it, because it is a bit pricier than some other models out there (as are it&#x27;s replacement blades) but this is well worth it.  The handle design is just right, the pivoting head is designed to glide over your skin.  It&#x27;s so light, it&#x27;s hard to get nicks and cuts with this (and trust me, I am the nick &amp; cut pro...) The tripple blades and lubricant strips are also very good.  I really think this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I finally spent the money on a razor that wasn&#x27;t disposable. I had tried so many in the past but was always disappointed, stubbly and razor burned. This razor offers a close shave with no nicks or burn (I have yet to nick myself with this razor-Band-Aid stock has since fallen). The blades also last a long time making the difference in price negligilble.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Venus Gillette razors, but this one is garbage.  I bought it a few weeks ago and have replaced the blades 3 times already. it just doesnt shave.  Not sure what happened with this version of these typically very good razors but it feels like a cheap disposable, misses spots everywhere.  I will be going back to the green package asap</li>
    <li> Great for legs. The angles of the blades seem to be a compromise between men&#x27;s and typical women&#x27;s razors.</li>
    <li> I have used several varieties of Venus razors and this one is awful. Not sharp at all and I ended up going out and buying a different one just a few days after taking this one out of the package.</li>
    <li> It works great and as advertised. Have had it for several months and no issues as of yet. Would likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a while now and I absolutely love them. You cannot go wrong with this. The blade is rather small so it gets in those hard places. Its so easy to use. Its great for a beginner as well. It has a good grip and an excellent result!</li>
    <li> It is really sharp. Just be careful using it, you might cut yourself with it. But overall it is still of good quality.</li>
    <li> Was a a bit disappointed that there was no holder along with this. I have always bought these in the UK and they always had the holder.</li>
    <li> Finally found a razor that doesn&#x27;t cut me and has a really smooth shave.  My legs and other parts feel great after I use this razor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about three years now. Whenever it starts to get dull, I can keep the razor itself and just change out the blades. Even the blades seem to last a long time, at least for me. I only have to change them once every six months. I like this because it has a moisture strip, but it&#x27;s small. The razors with big moisture strips are absolutely ridiculous; I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re supposed to use those for when you have no soap to use because those basically provide the soap for you, which I find annoying. I haven&#x27;t tried any 5-blade razors or anything like that so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this to, but it&#x27;s a good razor I&#x27;ve had for years that has never let me down, and I love the color.</li>
    <li> Cheap disgusting razor ,  I think it is the worst razor I have ever used , don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I missed that this is only a 3 blade razor, does not cut very well for me and it irritates my skin.  Not happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> My legs are always smooth after using this razor. At the low price, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, no matter how many razors I have.</li>
    <li> Great Product from Gillette. I received this direct from Gillette originally as a trail product at no cost and I love it. I had never used this type razor before and it is definitely worth the cost. It works well, and the blades give you a nice clean close shave without tearing up your skin, something that I often found hard to find in razors. The razors last long for me and overall they are definately are worth the cost. I would recommend and I will continue buying this product</li>
    <li> Never can get enough of razor since hair will grow forever.  Nice and great for my sensitive skin.  Thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razors but this is definitely the best i&#x27;ve used yet ever it hardly cuts me as much as other razors do and just using soap i got the smoothest shave ever!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. Works very well, great value for the money. Pivots nicely, reasonable refill prices too. Smooth shave.</li>
    <li> A good razor for people who don&#x27;t like disposable razors. What&#x27;s the opposite of disposable? Posable? Anyway, if you have fairly sensitive skin, not only are &amp;#34;women&#x27;s&amp;#34; razors a better choice, but this one is better than the others.</li>
    <li> One of my women friendsneeded a new razor for her legs.  She couldn&#x27;t find this at a good price in stores so she asked me to get this for her from Amazon.  Which, of course, I did.  She loves it and is very glad that she has it</li>
    <li> Makes legs feel scratchy after</li>
    <li> This Venus Divine razor is fantastic, and not to mention a gorgeous shade of blue. (My favorite color is blue). I have owned the original Venus razor (the light tealish one) for close to 15 years now, and I finally said to myself, I want a new razor. My old was still in working order, but just extremely faded. I am sure this one will last me another 15 years, and of course works just as well as my old one. I would recommend this product to anyone. Actually, as a mother&#x27;s day gift, I finally got my mother, who would only use disposables for 30 years, to finally switch to a Venus, and she is in love!! Neither she nor I will ever buy any other razor, lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the best at shaving, I usually look like I&#x27;ve gone ten rounds with a dull razor and lost, but these are fabulous for getting a nice smooth shave without slicing and dicing myself to bits.</li>
    <li> Awesome. My gf loves it</li>
    <li> Great deal they work very well easy to open packages and to change out the blades. Nice clean shave no nicks is very well for my very sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Hated the Schick Quattro and bought a Venus to replace it.  Love the Venus, very close shave, no nicking and no stubble.</li>
    <li> Good price love this razor. Especially around my knees .</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  Not one nick or cut since I started using it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, has a good performance, nice size and very easy to install on the wall.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several razors in the Gilette Venus line and have been fairly happy with all of them.  They don&#x27;t cut you easily, the razors last a long time and they are comfortable to hold.  This is one of the older versions and doesn&#x27;t have as many razor blades per cartridge as some of the others.  It also doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of those moisturizing strips, but to be honest I don&#x27;t think those do anything anyway.  All of the Gillette Venus razors tend to grow mold eventually and need to be replaced.  The cartridges are also pretty expensive - depending on the prices you find, it&#x27;s sometimes more worthwhile to just buy a whole new razor instead of refills.</li>
    <li> Awesome shave but WAY over priced. Is there some kind of monopoly fixing the prices of razors?</li>
    <li> While I normally love Venus razors this one is not the quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from them. I cut myself worse than I have using cheap disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I have purchased so many women&#x27;s razors, sometimes it is hard to keep up with all the brand names and types of razors.  I decided to purchase this Gillette Venus Divine because I have sensitive skin, and Gillette is in the business of razors, so I thought this should be helpful for me.  First, I was impressed with the packaging, and I did not review earlier because I was using other razors sets that I was not finish using at the time. I recently purchased and opened the Gillette Venus Divine Sensitive razor and was doubly impressed with the precision of the razor, the ease of use, and the effectiveness of the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any sensitive issue experiences after using this razor.  I only had one problem which was to remove the razor head piece from the handle after using the set.  It is sealed extremely tight, once you place it on top of the handle, which is great.  This would avoid the head piece from removing itself from the handle while using this product, which is very important.  I would definitely refer this razor set to anyone who has sensitive skin.  The results, price, and ease of use is excellent.  I am pleased with this product, and will definitely purchase this product in the future.  I finally removed the razor head piece from the handle with ease, it is a soft touch, not a heavy touch to remove the razor head piece from the handle.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> not what I expected for the price the razor head is so so small I just don&#x27;t like it, I mean its not the worst I had but certainly not the best, got to find something new any recommendations? comment below..thanks</li>
