      <li>It really wakes me up in the morning</li>
      <li>While I really like how it feels, I have concerns over the ingredients so won&#x27;t be purchasing this (or anything body shop ever again, tbh).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I buy this for my daughter; she uses it as a primer and she absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought this and used the entire bottle up. Its very silky and smells great, like oranges. When I put it on, it kind of feels like a weird film on my face. It didn&#x27;t feel like it absorbed, like I could scrape it off afterward. Didn&#x27;t care much for the texture. I also didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin texture or pores or wrinkles. I want to try something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this product during one of The Body Shop&#x27;s Buy 3, Get 3 Free product sales.  I use the rest of the line of the Vitamin C line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say that I love this product and see great results but I don&#x27;t see a difference using this. That being said I noticed from other reviews that it works as a makeup primer so I started using it for that. Since there is no SPF, I use it when I am going out at night.  It creates a base that makes skin feel like silk without adding shine or oil.  Makeup does last longer with it on too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably only buy it again though to use as a makeup primer.</li>
    <li> excellent product.  I actually use expensive skin care, but I love to put this on top.  It gives a Soft, smooth feel I love.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin boost filled with Vitamin C and anti-oxidents.  I love this mostly because it is a great make-up primer.  Your skin feels so soft and silky.  Make-up glides on and lasts!</li>
    <li> I have not ordered this product from Amazon, but have bought it from The Body Shop and have used it for over a year now. I apply it each morning under my day cream and it makes my skin so soft. This also allows me to use less day cream. One pump is enough to cover my face and one bottle usually lasts me about 2 months. As it is sort of expensive, I try to buy it in bulk when I can find it on sale and store it for later use. As I said, it makes my skin very soft and adds a light glow. This is one skin care product I&#x27;m more than willing to splurge on.</li>
    <li> why change a product which was perfection itself ? I have been using the previous version by the same name for years and bought several when it was discontinued. Recently I ran out and tried this new one. It is in no way comparable to the old one. Yes, it makes the skin soft but not at all as soft and leaves on your fingers a kind of waxy deposit. I felt I could not do without the original but do not have the same feelings about this new product which I will stop using when it is finished.</li>
    <li> Best used over sunscreen, moisturizer, etc as a smoother prior to make up. Used sparingly, it makes a good base that fills in little lines and imperfections. Used sparingly...if you overdo, it will flake off whatever you put under it. I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Amazing for your skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice pick me up if your face is feeling a little drab, but at the same time it works great as a primer and feels good going on. It really wakes me up in the morning</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning. It makes my skin super silky and and serves as an excellent base for makeup. It smooths out the skin surface and acts much like a primer. The formulation did change slightly when they updated a year or two back, but I still love it and go through a bottle of this every two months or so. Also excellent to use on neck. I also use the Vitamin C moisturizer and find that I don&#x27;t to use much of that thanks to the moisture I get from this. Since this doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen, I do recommend using a moisturizer with sunscreen after applying the skin boost.</li>
    <li> My favorite. Got my whole family hooked</li>
    <li> This was my second bottle of the stuff in the last couple of years.  While I really like how it feels, I have concerns over the ingredients so won&#x27;t be purchasing this (or anything body shop ever again, tbh).  I encourage you to check out ewg&#x27;s &amp;#34;Skin Deep&amp;#34; if you have similar concerns about health.  Just because something is &amp;#34;external only&amp;#34; does not make it safe, we absorb these chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t seem to have any luck using it as a primer but it does an okay job moisturizing.  I recently switched to pure coconut oil and the effects are more noticeable to me.</li>
    <li> The vitamin C is good, it&#x27;s smells good, feels good on the skin, but it does not do anything for your skin really, I mean it does not really moisturize it. I like it, but I am not crazy for it. I am keeping it, but I am not sure if I will order again.</li>
    <li> Love the product. My skills is brighter and without chemicals.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C helps to maintain smooth healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I love the glow that I get from this.</li>
    <li> Instantly smoothens your skin, really very good and non greasy</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I am so sad when I run out. Makes my skin look poreless. Great to put on just before makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it every morning. It makes my makeup go on smoother and the orange fresh smell makes me smile! Great feeling on my skin. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple years and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> We love Body Shop products! As always- 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I love this but it&#x27;s expensive - in stores it&#x27;s $26.  I&#x27;m limited to how often I buy it, unfortunately..</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I bought 2 as gifts. But when they arrived they had no tops (see picture), which was disappointing.</li>
    <li> I tried the serum for nearly 2 weeks but wasn&#x27;t impressed especially when compared against the Vitamin C capsules.  This serum feels a little chalky, as if it contains a lot of filler.  I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and although they recommend you give it a month or so, I am certain that it&#x27;s not going to improve much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to try this Vitamin C serum, try to get it on sale.  At nearly $30/bottle, you can find better quality serums in the market place.</li>
    <li> I love usig this for years! I use it as a primer, this is like the smashbox bestselling primer, but cheaper. Wen i use it b4 my powder/ liquid foundation, it glides very smooth. I love ths product!</li>
    <li> The people at Body shop said it would make my skin glow.  Perhaps it does I can not tell but that was not why I purchased this product.  I purchased this product because I wanted to feed my skin something healthy from time to time instead of just exposing it to the harsh environmental elements experienced daily.  My skin is sensitive and the citrus does not burn when I apply it to my face.  The texture is interesting because it feels dry although it is a cream and a little goes a long way.  Sometimes I get some on my lips and later will put on lip balm and the combination makes my lips feel really slippery.  Overall, I like this product it has a wonderful comforting, citrus smell and I feel my skin is happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  Expects it every birthday now</li>
    <li> The product arrived in perfect condition! It feels great on my skin, not heavy, or greasy at all. It feels very light, as though my skin could actually breathe! It also smells really nice! I would totally recommend this to people! 5 star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will update this review for any improvements on my skin... so far, i&#x27;m satisfied with the initial performance of this product! :)</li>
    <li> This is a primer that acts as a serum too.It silicone texture glides over the skin.Since I was not able to return it I decided to use it.</li>
    <li> I use Vitamin C serums on my face daily - this one is probably my most favorite one! Love how soft and silky this leaves my skin, make up goes on so smooth - I will definitely purchase this again in the future!</li>
    <li> feels like silicone.  Not a replacement for PTR sleep mask.  I won&#x27;t order this line again.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and simply add blush.  It is has a soft non oily feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this for all ages.</li>
    <li> The shipping was very timely. And the receipt was personalized which was quite nice. Also the product is good, you have to use it sparingly and definitely over moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy and citrusy! Feels good going on. I&#x27;ve been using it as a base before makeup. I thought it was a serum, however it asks to be put on after moisturizer...either way, it&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me last year.  I was a bit skeptical at first but after trying it for only week, I truly could see the difference on my face.  It has a glow!  I have used it immediately cleaning my face before putting on make-up.  It doesn&#x27;t give an oily base but makes you feel fresh throughout the day.  I just love it!  The product is so popular that our local store has ran out of stock recently.  I would recommend to anyone to give it a try.  The price is reasonable for such a great procut.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I use it after face moisturizer and before the foundation. It basically works like a primer with a boost that freshens the face. This also has a delicious citrus scent.</li>
    <li> Want to look really, really radiant everyday?  Use this stuff.  Put this on after you use a moisturizer (or instead of it even though it&#x27;s not really a moisturizer per se) and you will have people commenting on how you look different.  It really smoothes out the face and makes a very soft glow (nothing oily or makeup related when I say glow) - just a very natural and &amp;#34;boosted&amp;#34; look.  Smells good, feels great!</li>
    <li> I bought this at their store &amp; its great stuff. Smells soo good and is silky smooth. A little goes a long ways. I highly recomend this product. I have oily acne prone skin. Love it</li>
    <li> so great!  really awesome for your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product---just wish I didn&#x27;t go through so many bottles in such a short time.  The service was great!</li>
    <li> Your skin will be the smoothest it has ever been with this product.  Use it lightly in the morning and it&#x27;s a great primer.  You may experience some peeling at first (very light).  If you do, just pull back to using it every other day for awhile.  It is great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for like 6 years now. It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than to buy it directly at The Body Shop.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is by far my favorite face lotion as it goes on so silky and smooth and evens out skin tone.  I can&#x27;t live without it and every person I turn on to it becomes a loyal user as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now and am still absolutely in love with the results. My skin is soft and feels firmer. I give this product as gifts to those I love and brag about it to everyone else. I truly recommend this skin boost!</li>
    <li> I use this to help my makeup glide on more smoothly. I put a dab on my finger and a dab of make up and then spread it on my face. Great! But the vendor charges what I feel is too much for shipping/handling. So I am looking for another resource. I think I will go directly to The Body Shop website next time.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have been using it every morning under my makeup for several years now.  Makes your skin soft and smooth.  I let my sister try it and now she is hooked.</li>
    <li> No problems with my order.</li>
    <li> This C serum is by far my favorite. Very light and smooth texture. A little goes along way. Evens out my skin tone.  I have not found a better C serum. Excellent product. I am 58, so i look for real results. I use it along with a Retinol. Retinol X is available at Amazon also and is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Makes face soft and supple. Look of skin flawless!</li>
    <li> Works great just as described</li>
    <li> This product is between the consistency of vaseline and a gel serum. It leaves a terrible greasy residue that I had to wash my hands after use. (and my face as well). I had to wash it off because it felt like a heavy mask.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning to the PeterThomasRoth Camu Camu berry Power C, unfortunately more expensive.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, leaves skin soft and has a lovely citrus scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff does add a smoothness to the face.... Just as if you&#x27;d spread a layer of silicon and petrol derivatives on it... Nice and soft. I always thought the body shop&#x27;s products were mostly natural but I was so wrong! I dare you to Look up the list of ingredients (peel the label and its under it google them if you don&#x27;t know) and decide if you still want this on your face to make it \\&quot;healthier\\&quot;. You&#x27;d be better off with smashing a kiwi in your face at least you&#x27;d have real vitamin C, the boost and tonic!&lt;br /&gt; I regret I didn&#x27;t read ingredients first but at least I got it from a sale... I did actually try it at least! But I don&#x27;t want this on my face.... Is seems a bit unhealthy!</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Very smooth. I only gave it a four star because it is a little oily for me.</li>
