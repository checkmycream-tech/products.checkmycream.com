<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is awesome. I love the fluidity of it. It&#x27;s great all on its own and as a carrier oil. I use it on my eyelashes and brows to make them grow faster and happily, this brand makes them thicker as well. I also use it on my lips and it doesn&#x27;t have a funky taste like a couple other brands I&#x27;ve used. Even more, it smells delicious. I will never choose another brand again!</li>
    <li> The one star is for the way the oil was packaged. About 1/4 of it leaked out on a set of books that were shipped in the same package.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to my homemade lip balm that I make! I love your Vitamin E oil!</li>
    <li> This smells so good! I bought it to make some homemade beauty products and it works nicely. I&#x27;ve also used this as a moisturizer, applying it directly to my face. It feels so nice and my skin feels so soft. It does seem to feel oily at first, but it absorbs into the skin. A little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> smells fantastic nice and light oil love it</li>
    <li> second botle works well special in the beginning</li>
    <li> Great smell and smooth oil.</li>
    <li> If you want to treat your skin well, get this! It lasts throughout the day leeping my skin wrinkle free, soft, looking young and feeling wonderful. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. The little 4oz bottle will last you a month at least if used properly. It works especially well at keeping your skin from looking and feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And fellas, this ain&#x27;t just for ladies, either. My husband works in construction. I finally convinced him to try it, telling him how good it&#x27;d be for all his cuts and bruises. He looked at me like I was crazy, but after making sure it didn&#x27;t smell weird -- it has no smell -- he agreed to give it a go. Low and behold it healed him right up! He has used it everyday since and swears by it. In fact, we have to buy 2 at a time now, bc he never remembers that it works best when his skin is still slightly wet. He forgets, dries off completely and the uses half a bottle each time!</li>
    <li> Great product and price.</li>
    <li> Best thing for my combination skin</li>
    <li> This oil was exactly what the wife needed and it came quickly</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my face at night and also my hands.  It is not sticky.  I am adding this to my daily routine.</li>
    <li> love love love and it smells nice</li>
    <li> I put this in my lotion and my skin is already softer</li>
    <li> The bottle leaked on all my other items. I was very disappointed, not only did I think it might ruin one of the other items I had to clean it off of everything, and lost a quarter of the oil that cost me $9.00</li>
    <li> Read the whole description!! This is not vitamin E oil it&#x27;s a blend, I was looking for a pure vitamin E oil not a blend. So I&#x27;m disappointed but it was my own fault for not reading the whole description.</li>
    <li> Great product I use it in my homemade lotions and hair care masks. Love this stuff. Will definitely be back to buy more especially at such a great price.</li>
    <li> Very good product. My skin loves it. Smells nice too</li>
    <li> I began to use this on my relatives dogs and puppy for their extremely dry skin. That was almost 2 weeks ago now and all of them have been healing up wonderfully. I love how, even if they lick it, there&#x27;s no harm to them&amp; they&#x27;re just loving the relief!</li>
    <li> Great product for adding to homemade lotions and creams.</li>
    <li> Did not come sealed. Oil was everywhere</li>
    <li> Love it! I use the vitamin E oil along with essential oil and liquid soap to make my own shower wash. Great</li>
    <li> I create my own creams and lotions.  This is great to use as a preservative.  It works really well.  This is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; preservative.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the only product that saves my hands from overdrying and cracking in the winter. On my left index finger, when I&#x27;m really stressed, I get a nickle-size circle of psoriasis. This is the only product that helps sooth it and get it to settle down.</li>
    <li> This works great.  a little bit goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> Great product. Feels good, works great.</li>
    <li> Wish the description was more clear on the ingredients, wasn&#x27;t looking for vitamin E with several oils mixed with it. Probably why it was cheaper, it&#x27;s diluted with oils</li>
    <li> This is not 100% vitamin E. It has other ingredients.  I like my natural products to contain only that ingredient.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. It has a nice smell, and feels nice. My only issue is that when it was shipped, some of the oil leaked out all over the box and the other item it was shipped with.</li>
    <li> I like this very much. Good scent, feels great, not too greasy feeling on skin. I had one myself already and ordered a new one for my mom&#x27;s birthday. The product arrived a few days before her visit, but it arrived leaking. :( Now I have to give my mom a sticky, oil covered bottle because I don&#x27;t have enough time to return or exchange it. The bottle was not protected with a seal beneath the lid, but Amazon also packaged it in a flimsy envelope along with a dvd we ordered at the same time.</li>
    <li> Great quality and vaue</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Good quality vitamin E oil!  Does have a slight almond scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well as part of my DIY brow/lash growth serum.</li>
    <li> I was weary of the ingredients at first because of other reviews on other vitamin E oils, but the ingredients listed on the bottle state that it is made all natural! It also smells really nice and fulfills its purpose well. What&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
    <li> This is an oil blend that contains Vitamin E oil and several other oils that are all very good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells heavenly (mostly like almond) and feels luxurious on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some oils can feel very greasy and unpleasant on the skin. This oil is thinner and seems to get absorbed easily, it feels silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not 100% Vitamin E oil, but you should know that when ordering. It&#x27;s clearly advertised as being a 5,000 iU Vitamin E oil blend. Pure Vitamin E oil is very thick and gooey stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;Safflower oil and/or soybean oil, almond oil, apricot oil, avocado oil, wheat germ oil, vitamin E, lecithin, propylparaben, fragrance.</li>
    <li> I originally posted a different review because of my original first impression, or in this case, smell. Cant really explain it, but it does smell just like almonds. Maybe I took too big of a \\&quot;whiff\\&quot; the first time. Its all good!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great produce. Only problem is when the product was delivered it was not sealed well and some of the product leaked in the box. I would be more careful with the packing of this item. I really love the product my skin feels healthy and smooth. thank you</li>
    <li> This product was more than i expected it smells great i mix it with my other oils for my skin and hair or i just put it on my face , i love this oil the bottle just needs to be bigger.</li>
    <li> My husband had carpal tunnel surgery on both hands (one at a time) After stitches are removed after washing his hands he massages incision area with this oil to prevent scar tissue from building up. Recommended by his doctor. Works great and he doesn&#x27;t mind doing it the oil absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product is organic but I was a little disappointed to see so many ingredients listed on the bottle. I was looking for more vitamin E and less filler. All nourishing ingredients at least.</li>
    <li> Great oil, fantastic to help with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is so good for winter. My skin is so moisturized. I am very happy with this oil. May be too heavy for summer use. But I used it on my hair as well, and it was great</li>
    <li> Good for use on scars</li>
    <li> Jason always makes a high quality product, I love this!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works it&#x27;s magic on my Very Very dry Skin.</li>
    <li> Clean, fragrance free. I used it to make body butter and seemed to work great.&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful product at a reasonable price, as far as I can tell!</li>
    <li> nice oil, works well in my skin care cream.</li>
    <li> I cannot do without this product! I use it all over when my skin is still damp from the shower, then towel off. It leaves my skin so beautiful</li>
    <li> My mother inlaw using this to make her bath fizzies. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I use it every day. I think it&#x27;s much better than the thicker, goopy type that I&#x27;ve used before. It&#x27;s a very thin liquid which makes it easy to apply. Even my 2 year old loves using it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I use vitamin e oil on my face, skin, scalp and hair. This is perfect to mix in your favorite lotion or cream - or make your own beauty mix! Vitamin E oil has so many uses. I mix this with other oils and use it on my scalp and hair, it works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat scars or burns, use on stretch marks, treatment of eczema and psoriasis, use on dry nails and cuticles, treatment of chapped lips and cold sores, use as a skin moisturizer, has anti-aging benefits, treatment of sunburn, treatment of brown spots, under eye treatment and Make-up Remover, stimulates hair growth, repairs split ends.</li>
    <li> as the cold settled in after last summer my skin got very very dry and I would constantly be uncomfortable. I remember taking a shower in the morning before work and then stepping outside would be a nightmare because I would just dry out like the sahara. it was actually my wife who recommended I use something like this so I finally bought it. it smells real good, makes you look better, and keeps the moisture inside. I thought that after the winter I would stop using it but I think I have become addicted... this is now the third bottle I have bought. I&#x27;m going to use it in the hot summer as well!</li>
    <li> Very nice as a skin and cuticle softener. It is just the right consistency - not so thick that it pulls at the skin or so thin that it runs all over the place. I just purchased my third bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a good addition to my homemade lotions</li>
    <li> Good size bottle and smells great. I wanted to use it under my eyes to help with circles hasn&#x27;t help. But I would buy again</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It has a pleasant smell and a little goes a long way. I use it in my homemade body lotion and as tattoo aftercare, and it works great. Much more gentle on sensitive, newly tattooed skin than chemical-filled lotion, and I can&#x27;t seem to buy enough of it at once. Will definitely buy a larger bottle next time.</li>
    <li> Wow the smell is beautiful!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a masseuse for dry skin. It works wonders! FYI though -- Like others had mentioned in their reviews, this bottle does leak!</li>
