      <li>These are very nice!  </li>
      <li>these polishes are beautiful and so cheap!!!</li>
      <li>All the colors are really great.  </li>
      <li>The polishes are BEAUTIFUL and has a nice selection with the set...</li>
      <li>They look great on their own or over another color.  </li>
      <li>but I loved the way the Prismatic colors sparkled.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome</li>
      <li>On their own I think 2 coats should do the trick.</li>
      <li>(Seller was awesome and they shipped really fast, received them in two days, even though it said 5-12.</li>
      <li>thanks for providing me with an awesome product.</li>
      <li>I was so thrilled when I got this in the mail.</li>
      <li>I wanted to LOVE these but dont.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it</li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>sparkling and I love the glitter.</li>
      <li>and I immediately fell in love.</li>
      <li>I love china glaze already</li>
      <li>Love it on toes.</li>
      <li>Chipped off within a day regardless of how many coats I put on.  </li>
      <li>With or without top coat I&#x27;ve tried mani&#x27;s with both.</li>
      <li>applied two coats of the Prismatic on my fingernails and finished them off with an off-brand top coat.  </li>
      <li>just flat out awesome!  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with these beautiful glitter polishes and a great price to boot!  </li>
      <li>They went on so beautifully with only 2 coats needed.  </li>
      <li>so pleased with how quickly the polish dries.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge China Glaze fan.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap they are.  </li>
      <li>One thing I like is that at times depending on how the light catches the polish I notice a shift in the color.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it if you love glitter</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty much all I own or the most part.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that they kind of chip easy, even with a top coat.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re so worth it!</li>
      <li>While I like Prism, I don&#x27;t need two bottles, and was looking forward to Full Spectrum.</li>
      <li>,I felt like they could use more individual personality-maybe different glitter based on the color, but if you love glitter polish, you will love all these!  </li>
      <li>They look pretty cool on their own, too, but the true beauty is when you put them over black.</li>
      <li>shipping was super fast as well.</li>
      <li>I like actually having to force nail polishes to come off because that means it&#x27;s a great formula that will last for days.</li>
      <li>I think the glitters are pretty.</li>
      <li>and then on top of that there are bigger pieces of multi colored glitter.</li>
      <li>I love the different shades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they are meant to be sold individually</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get the first three colors shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>I compared the bottles to other china glaze ones I own and they did not match up at all.</li>
      <li>I always use a top coat, but just wanted to see how long my mani would last without a top coat with these polishes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most drug store brands, from cheap $2 brands that chip a day after to the more expensive brands that cost as much $10 per bottle.</li>
      <li>These babies look absolutely AMAZING over black polish.</li>
      <li>but I wont get as much use out of the colors as I wanted</li>
      <li>Just be careful what top coat you use because the silver color can turn yellowish.</li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re also very opaque.</li>
      <li>I have wanted these forever and had managed to get one of them at a store but then went for the whole collection on here for a fraction of what I would have paid</li>
      <li>Nice colors, but didn&#x27;t last long - chipped within a couple days.</li>
      <li>highly recommend China Glaze.  </li>
      <li>SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH, I FEEL LIKE A PROFESSIONAL NAIL TECH</li>
      <li>It lasts for such a long time, just like many glitter polishes do.</li>
      <li>The problem with it was that Full Spectrum, the pink, did not ship!</li>
      <li>The blue is so far my favorite, the purple and pink are almost the same.</li>
      <li>The coverage is good with one coat and when I run my finger across the dried polish it isn&#x27;t too gritty, though it&#x27;s not perfectly smooth either.</li>
      <li>The colors, especially over black, are crazy awesome!!!</li>
      <li>The problem with many of those was that it was next to impossible to get a smooth finish.  </li>
      <li>Glitter polish really stinks to take off, but on the bright side this stuff is very long wearing.  </li>

<li> Glitter polish really stinks to take off, but on the bright side this stuff is very long wearing.  </li>
<li> They have large specks of all different rainbow colored glitter as well as small flecks.  </li>
<li> I hand wash my dishes in fairly hot, soapy water at least twice a day (and I don&#x27;t wear gloves).  </li>
<li> Lasts for such a long time.</li>
<li> Goes on pretty thick.  </li>
<li> With the China Glaze, it goes on evenly without it clumping or creating unsightly dry lines in the middle of the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The green and purple are my favorites so far.</li>
<li> I ordered these so excited to have the prismatic collection, but when they came in the mail and I use one I realized they were fake.</li>
<li> 4 Stars for product, minus one for mistakes.</li>
<li> I was not sure when I ordered this, thinking they might be the same colors with a hint of difference.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
<li> had I bought them all individually, not to mention that one that is so hard to find I got now too</li>
<li> Not worth the time to remove it from the nails.</li>
<li> Over black or another base you only need one coat for full coverage.</li>
<li> I am a bit impatient when it comes to any type of beauty regimen</li>
<li> I will say that they are all very similar, just slight change in the back round color base</li>
<li> So I use no top coat for now.</li>
<li> So I ended up paying for two sets of the last 3 bottles that are useless because they are duplicates.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a sucker for glittery nails.  </li>
<li> I notice on the blue and green colors that the base is also composed of a jelly base in the same hue.</li>
<li> go opaque in 2 coats and the base color isn&#x27;t clear, they actually have base color as shown on the monitor.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
<li> I was skeptical.  </li>
<li> BUT they chip so bad... within a day..</li>
<li> I was not in the slightest disappointed with the product.</li>
<li> If I had to describe what the polish looks like up close, it looks like there is a base color, which in itself is glitter</li>
<li> and I STILL was disappointed!</li>

    <li> These are very nice!  They look great on their own or over another color.  They have large specks of all different rainbow colored glitter as well as small flecks.  Goes on pretty thick.  I will say that they are all very similar, just slight change in the back round color base,I felt like they could use more individual personality-maybe different glitter based on the color, but if you love glitter polish, you will love all these!  I&#x27;m sure they are meant to be sold individually and that is why they are so similar. The blue is so far my favorite, the purple and pink are almost the same. (Seller was awesome and they shipped really fast, received them in two days, even though it said 5-12. Product came from Cali and I am in Michigan. Awesome!) (love2shoppinhere was my seller)</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled when I got this in the mail. Arrived way before date set and I immediately fell in love. I am a huge China Glaze fan. It&#x27;s pretty much all I own or the most part. This collection will not disappoint you. It lasts for such a long time, just like many glitter polishes do. I like actually having to force nail polishes to come off because that means it&#x27;s a great formula that will last for days. This collection is one of those. Lasts for such a long time. With or without top coat I&#x27;ve tried mani&#x27;s with both. I always use a top coat, but just wanted to see how long my mani would last without a top coat with these polishes and I STILL was disappointed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only recently that I started pampering my nails with at-home treatments and polish. I&#x27;ve tried most drug store brands, from cheap $2 brands that chip a day after to the more expensive brands that cost as much $10 per bottle. I happened across a fashion blog post that was all about China Glaze.  I had never even heard of it but I loved the way the Prismatic colors sparkled.  I&#x27;m a sucker for glittery nails.  I immediately searched for them on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap they are.  I was skeptical.  I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome this brand is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied two coats of the Prismatic on my fingernails and finished them off with an off-brand top coat.  It has been close to a week and they still look as if I had painted them only a day ago.  I hand wash my dishes in fairly hot, soapy water at least twice a day (and I don&#x27;t wear gloves).  I also work with my hands a lot doing arts and crafts, using tools that sometimes find their way banging on to my nails.  But my sparkly nails still look fab!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with how quickly the polish dries.  I am a bit impatient when it comes to any type of beauty regimen so I often bought the fast-dry brands.  The problem with many of those was that it was next to impossible to get a smooth finish.  With the China Glaze, it goes on evenly without it clumping or creating unsightly dry lines in the middle of the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend China Glaze.  In fact, I don&#x27;t plan on ever buying another brand.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Nice colors, but didn&#x27;t last long - chipped within a couple days.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH, I FEEL LIKE A PROFESSIONAL NAIL TECH</li>
    <li> I received an alert that this set of polishes were discounted by $20 or $30 dollars. I paid $19 for all 6 bottles. That is an awesome deal.  The colors, especially over black, are crazy awesome!!! Received order w/ no problems.</li>
    <li> I was not in the slightest disappointed with the product. The problem with it was that Full Spectrum, the pink, did not ship! Instead, I was given two bottles of Prism, the purple. While I like Prism, I don&#x27;t need two bottles, and was looking forward to Full Spectrum. 4 Stars for product, minus one for mistakes.</li>
    <li> I think the glitters are pretty. One thing I like is that at times depending on how the light catches the polish I notice a shift in the color. If I had to describe what the polish looks like up close, it looks like there is a base color, which in itself is glitter and then on top of that there are bigger pieces of multi colored glitter. I notice on the blue and green colors that the base is also composed of a jelly base in the same hue. The coverage is good with one coat and when I run my finger across the dried polish it isn&#x27;t too gritty, though it&#x27;s not perfectly smooth either. Overall after seeing them up close and personal, I could do without two of the colors, they just don&#x27;t do anything for me. I do like the chroma glitters collection but I don&#x27;t love it, I&#x27;m not wowed by it.</li>
    <li> these polishes are beautiful and so cheap!!! they&#x27;re glitters so they&#x27;re going to chip but they&#x27;re so worth it! shipping was super fast as well. thanks for providing me with an awesome product.</li>
    <li> Some of the colors looked the same 2almost identical &amp; a 3rd one that was close but slightly different</li>
    <li> I was not sure when I ordered this, thinking they might be the same colors with a hint of difference.&lt;br /&gt;Well they are all different.&lt;br /&gt;They go opaque in 2 coats and the base color isn&#x27;t clear, they actually have base color as shown on the monitor.&lt;br /&gt;Very sparkling and I love the glitter.</li>
    <li> I ordered these so excited to have the prismatic collection, but when they came in the mail and I use one I realized they were fake. I compared the bottles to other china glaze ones I own and they did not match up at all. Even giving one star is generous of me. Don&#x27;t buy these unless you want low quality knockoffs.</li>
    <li> just flat out awesome!  great toppers!  I have wanted these forever and had managed to get one of them at a store but then went for the whole collection on here for a fraction of what I would have paid had I bought them all individually, not to mention that one that is so hard to find I got now too</li>
    <li> The description says it&#x27;s for 6 colors, but I received two sets of the the same 3 colors. I didn&#x27;t get the first three colors shown in the picture. So I ended up paying for two sets of the last 3 bottles that are useless because they are duplicates.</li>
    <li> All the colors are really great.  Glitter polish really stinks to take off, but on the bright side this stuff is very long wearing.  Love it on toes.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these beautiful glitter polishes and a great price to boot!  The green and purple are my favorites so far.</li>
    <li> The polishes are BEAUTIFUL and has a nice selection with the set... BUT they chip so bad... within a day.. no matter what i do they chip... I wanted to LOVE these but dont. I dont regret buying them but I wont get as much use out of the colors as I wanted because I like to keep my manicures for several days before i change polish colors.</li>
    <li> Chipped off within a day regardless of how many coats I put on.  Not worth the time to remove it from the nails.</li>
    <li> I love china glaze already but these were so AWESOME!  They went on so beautifully with only 2 coats needed.  The only problem is that they kind of chip easy, even with a top coat.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time. I love the different shades. Just be careful what top coat you use because the silver color can turn yellowish. So I use no top coat for now.</li>
    <li> These babies look absolutely AMAZING over black polish. They look pretty cool on their own, too, but the true beauty is when you put them over black. Totally worth it if you love glitter like I do.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, they&#x27;re also very opaque. Over black or another base you only need one coat for full coverage. On their own I think 2 coats should do the trick. Pain in the a** to remove but that&#x27;s just the way glitters are. They just want to be all up on that nail, as is their way.</li>
