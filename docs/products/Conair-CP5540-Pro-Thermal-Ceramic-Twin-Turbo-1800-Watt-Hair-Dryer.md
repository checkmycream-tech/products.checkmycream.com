      <li>Great dryer!</li>
      <li>If they put a quality cord on the Thermal Ceramic, they&#x27;d have a very good product indeed.</li>

      <li>Works great to hold in my curls and the drier is easy to hold.  </li>

      <li>nice..</li>
      <li>My sister said she really likes it,  that it&#x27;s a great blow dryer!</li>
      <li>When it quit I worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find one that I liked to replace it.  </li>
      <li>What I love about it is it has 12 heat/fan settings, which is amazing.  </li>
      <li>I have lots of wavy fine hair that I straighten and it does a nice job.</li>
      <li>I have been buying  this dryer for over 5 years and love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing if you have a lot of hair and want your hair to look smooth and not frizzy.</li>
      <li>I had a Conair for many years and it was getting beat up it still works, but for the price of this one I needed to trade up..</li>
      <li>Love this blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years at home and in the salon.  </li>
      <li>It takes awhile to get used to being able to hold on to it without accidentally flipping a switch.  </li>
      <li>and she says her hair never looked better.</li>
      <li>Sally didn&#x27;t have more than 4 on any of their blow dryers.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>The 2000 watt is much better</li>
      <li>Glad I chose this one.  </li>
      <li>Love this hair dryer..</li>
      <li>Other than that, works great and great price for one with this many settings.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere at a good price and thank God that Amazon had it reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>and it is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>so to go from Hot to Warm</li>
      <li>I purchased it 7 months ago, and it no longer gets warm or hot.  </li>
      <li>The hair dryer works fine</li>
      <li>This little hair dryer is the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I was nervous that maybe it would be a cheap version</li>
      <li>my hair is important to me..</li>
      <li>I liked it so much I purchased a spare for when this wears out.</li>
      <li>Comfortable.</li>
      <li>worth all the money!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay more for a quality hair dryer, so I skip the discount stores and head to Sally Beauty Supply for the higher-priced Conair models.  </li>
      <li>Its powerful and dries my hair QUICK!</li>
      <li>When it did work, I was happy with it, it did seem to make my hair feel smoother and it was pretty quiet</li>
      <li>so a good blow dryer is essential.  </li>
      <li>if only I could give it to her for a chistmas gift life would be good....</li>
      <li>Lightweight,heats nicely,stays cool to the touch.</li>
      <li>I wanted to replace my old 1000 watt hairdryer with somthing more powerful, and this really filled the bill.  </li>
      <li>This hair dryer is exactly like one your hairstylist would use!</li>
      <li>but I am not crazy at all about where the on and off switch is located on the handle</li>
      <li>still worth it to me.  </li>
      <li>most importantly is just as quiet.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;--Why is Cool in the middle of Hot and Warm-</li>
      <li>Powerful dryer, drys my hair</li>
      <li>and now my girl friend wants one, which is good because she&#x27;s rough on mine...</li>
      <li>We gave this as a gift for Christmas, and all feedback from my daughter is that she likes it very much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only blow dryer I have found that makes my hair look so shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>Also leaves my hair smooth, soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Hot heat but fan speed doesn&#x27;t blow my hair all around like some dryers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a dryer that looks EXACTLY like this</li>
      <li>versatillity is more than enough for all type of hair styles</li>
      <li>I have been wearing my hair straight back and kind of high,\\&quot;Pomadour\\&quot; since high school</li>
      <li>It has hot and cold adjustments for the air, which is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I am glad to find a reasonably priced unit that actually blows strong air for a fast hair dry.</li>
      <li>i have curly hair that I wear straight</li>
      <li>It goes from very low to the full 1,800 watts of power and cold/warm/hot as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>( first one got old and died)</li>
      <li>Also leaves it soft and shiny not frizzy like some others that get just as hot...</li>
      <li>Replaces older bulkier hair dryer,liked the price arrived as promised.</li>
      <li>iI would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
      <li>I swap out the salon one for home and use the new one at work.  </li>
      <li>I had one that lasted me about 7 years and replaced it with the exact same one.  </li>
      <li>You will not be disappointed with this great hairdryer!!!  </li>
      <li>Second one we purchased as the first went off to college.</li>
      <li>I also can open the back up to clean the vent,</li>
      <li>HEAVY, EASY TO CARRY.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it is not heavy.</li>
      <li>I would compare it to those that are used by professional stylists.  </li>
      <li>Just the same as my old one!</li>
      <li>so I will have them for many years to come and the 2 were less than half the price together as the one I bought four years ago.</li>
      <li>and yes it is quiet, compared to the old one</li>
      <li>WOW, bought this some time back</li>
      <li>does not dry well and leaves the hair frizzy.  </li>
      <li>The first one is at least 10 years old and is stil working</li>
      <li>The switches are small but work, only rarely hit them by accident.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> the only dryer I will buy</li>
    <li> Hot heat but fan speed doesn&#x27;t blow my hair all around like some dryers. Long cord. Fairly lightweight. Comfortable. My last Conair lated for years. Hopefully this will do the same.</li>
    <li> Great product, been using for about a year now.  Second one we purchased as the first went off to college.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.. I&#x27;ve used it for many years at home and in the salon.  I get about 3-4 years out of them.  Once one goes out I swap out the salon one for home and use the new one at work.  I do have to say that my newest one did not last as long as the others, but could definitely be a fluke.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a dryer that looks EXACTLY like this that I bought for $100 10 years ago.  When it quit I worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find one that I liked to replace it.  I was amazed to see its twin for a 1/3 the price including shipping.  I was nervous that maybe it would be a cheap version but I&#x27;m very happy.  It weighs a little less (yeah) than my old one and most importantly is just as quiet.  I have lots of wavy fine hair that I straighten and it does a nice job. I also like the cord which is longer than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay more for a quality hair dryer, so I skip the discount stores and head to Sally Beauty Supply for the higher-priced Conair models.  I previously owned the Silver Bird, but it died when I dropped it on the floor and broke the ceramic insert.  I bought this model as a replacement because it&#x27;s lightweight and the Silver Bird was quite a workout.  Unfortunately, the cord on this model is pretty lame.  It twists and curls and has a mind of its own.  If they put a quality cord on the Thermal Ceramic, they&#x27;d have a very good product indeed.</li>
    <li> does not dry well and leaves the hair frizzy.  The 2000 watt is much better</li>
    <li> WOW, bought this some time back I needed to give it a work out before I talk about it.. Im not a hair stylist but my hair is important to me.. I have been wearing my hair straight back and kind of high,\\&quot;Pomadour\\&quot; since high school.. I had a Conair for many years and it was getting beat up it still works, but for the price of this one I needed to trade up.. I read about the Ceramic and yes my hair seems to look fuller and smoother... I read that the buttons get in the way but like I said im not a stylist so I dont wrap my hands around the handle, who does that when drying your own hair?  The amount of speed and temp. versatillity is more than enough for all type of hair styles and yes it is quiet, compared to the old one, now I can hear the door bell.. I also can open the back up to clean the vent, nice.. Like I said I,m a guy so a dryer is a dryer I only had two in my life time so what do I know only that it does work for me....and now my girl friend wants one, which is good because she&#x27;s rough on mine... if only I could give it to her for a chistmas gift life would be good....</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas present.  My sister said she really likes it,  that it&#x27;s a great blow dryer! Glad I chose this one.  Did a lot of research before purchasing.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this unit after we have used a similar one for a couple of years. Given the performance of the initial unit we decided to exchange all dryers in our household for the same unit. I am glad to find a reasonably priced unit that actually blows strong air for a fast hair dry.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a few months now without any problems. It is a little heavier than the last hair dryer I had, but it seems well built. The cord is long- but in my case a bit longer than I need (and longer than I had before) and it can get in the way. The switches are small but work, only rarely hit them by accident.&lt;br /&gt;I would like the controls to be better.&lt;br /&gt;--Why is Off in the middle of Hi and Low- so to change from Hi to Low and I have to switch past Off.&lt;br /&gt;--Why is Cool in the middle of Hot and Warm- so to go from Hot to Warm I need to switch past Off.&lt;br /&gt;--And why is there just Hi and Low, but then there is a Turbo mode that make each of them blow a bit stronger? Why not just have speeds 1-4?</li>
    <li> it only lasted me a year and a half, but hey you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchased. The first one is at least 10 years old and is stil working but I bought this just in case. I also bought one for my daughter and she says her hair never looked better.</li>
    <li> I have been buying  this dryer for over 5 years and love it. i have curly hair that I wear straight and it works great. I always keep one on hand in case mine goes out. Not sure what i will do if con air quits making it.</li>
    <li> We gave this as a gift for Christmas, and all feedback from my daughter is that she likes it very much.</li>
    <li> My M-I-L has this dryer in both their condo and their house. She wanted a backup and my wife wanted an extra as well. Reasons are:lightweight, dependable, long-lasting, efficient.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works fine but I am not crazy at all about where the on and off switch is located on the handle and I invariably turn off the dryer at least once during the dryer when I move my fingers.</li>
    <li> I have very difficult hair (frizzy, curly, cowlick (spelling?) so a good blow dryer is essential.  This is the only one that I could find that does a decent job with my difficult hair without buying a professional blow dryer, which can be difficult to obtain. Notice my last one only last two years but still worth it to me.  This time I bought two so that I am not without if it goes bad.  Keep 2nd in my guest bathroom.  Guests love it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace my old 1000 watt hairdryer with somthing more powerful, and this really filled the bill.  It has hot and cold adjustments for the air, which is wonderful.  My only complaint is that the control buttons are on the handle right where you hold it, so I&#x27;ve had to adjust how I hold the dryer so I&#x27;m not constantly making unwanted changes.</li>
    <li> This is our second purchase of this style and brand. ( first one got old and died) We like the cold shot button. You don&#x27;t have to hold it on to keep it cold!</li>
    <li> Powerful dryer, drys my hair 2x faster than any hairdryer I have ever had.  I would compare it to those that are used by professional stylists.  Also leaves my hair smooth, soft and shiny.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not experienced any problems with placement of switches.  I have purchased one for myself, one for my mother, one for a friend and today, I will be placing another order for my daughter.  You will not be disappointed with this great hairdryer!!!  (Forgot to mention another plus-this dryer cost me 22.50-a wonderful deal for this quality of hairdryer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE-I purchased this dryer in June of 2013.  It is now July 2015 and it is still going strong.  I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> My hair was extremely soft and my drying time was cut in half. it is not heavy. iI would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given it five stars but as some others noted, the controls are a bit awkward.  It takes awhile to get used to being able to hold on to it without accidentally flipping a switch.  Other than that, works great and great price for one with this many settings.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Just the same as my old one! I will be buying another one soon just for a back up! I never want to use another hair dryer again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT HAVING 3 TEMPERATURE OPTIONS.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;NOT HEAVY, EASY TO CARRY.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is exactly like one your hairstylist would use! Its powerful and dries my hair QUICK! Also leaves it soft and shiny not frizzy like some others that get just as hot...worth all the money!</li>
    <li> I have owned this hair dryer for a few weeks and already it is smelling \\&quot;hot\\&quot;.  I am concerned it will not last.</li>
    <li> I purchased it 7 months ago, and it no longer gets warm or hot.  When it did work, I was happy with it, it did seem to make my hair feel smoother and it was pretty quiet--it doesn&#x27;t have that high-pitched whirring sound that is annoying with typical hairdryers.  Before this one, I had 2 Sharper Image quiet ionic hairdryers that each lasted at least 5 years.  I&#x27;ll figure out how to hassle with the warranty, hope it pays off.</li>
    <li> This little hair dryer is the best I&#x27;ve used.  I bought one at a store and my granddaughter wanted one like it.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere at a good price and thank God that Amazon had it reasonably priced.  A great hairdryer!!</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer. I&#x27;ve gone thru 3 in the past 10 years. It&#x27;s amazing if you have a lot of hair and want your hair to look smooth and not frizzy. It&#x27;s the only blow dryer I have found that makes my hair look so shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair this is a must.  Most driers have a button you have to hold down to get cold air.  This has a switch and stays on cold.  Works great to hold in my curls and the drier is easy to hold.  I liked it so much I purchased a spare for when this wears out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this blow dryer for 4 years and know it&#x27;s days are numbered so I looked at Sally Beauty where I purchased it and they no longer carry it.  What I love about it is it has 12 heat/fan settings, which is amazing.  Sally didn&#x27;t have more than 4 on any of their blow dryers.  It goes from very low to the full 1,800 watts of power and cold/warm/hot as well.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 so I will have them for many years to come and the 2 were less than half the price together as the one I bought four years ago.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever bought!  I had one that lasted me about 7 years and replaced it with the exact same one.  I hope this one last me just as long.</li>
    <li> Great dryer! I had one before and it broke, so I was replacing it.</li>
    <li> Replaces older bulkier hair dryer,liked the price arrived as promised. Lightweight,heats nicely,stays cool to the touch. Would&lt;br /&gt;rcommend this product.</li>
