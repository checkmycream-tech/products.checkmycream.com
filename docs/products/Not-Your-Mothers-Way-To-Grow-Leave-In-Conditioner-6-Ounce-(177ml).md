      <li>It does really work!!</li>
      <li>this is stuff is pretty cool.</li>
      <li>The reasons are because I, like many other reviewers, have experienced significant hair loss with each use, but far more concerning than the hair loss are the large, itchy, red sores I developed at the hairline.</li>

      <li>When I sprayed the conditioner in after my shower it wasn&#x27;t a mist like action, it was a straight line right onto my scalp.  </li>
      <li>and it made my hair really soft and shiny and detaingled all the knots, and i just wrote this review right after i took the shower.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel nice and soft, even when using it with other shampoos and conditioners.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I do not know if this is a coincidence or what, but my hair has grown so much faster after I started using this. I noticed a difference within about 2 weeks of use. My hair was up to my chin thanks to a butcher job at a fly by night salon. After one month, my hair is just past my shoulders. I really didn&#x27;t think it would work, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try after reading good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter started using it after I did; because she could see a difference in my hair. Now her hair is growing. I just ordered two more bottles. I LOVE it and it smells super good.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and purchased this product to help speed up growth. In addition to my hair being fine, I have also noticed that since I&#x27;ve hit my 30&#x27;s that my hair seems thinner and takes longer to grow. I read many great reviews of the Not Your Mothers Way to Grow Long and Strong line and thought it was worth a try. I used the shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner (twice per week) for approximately two weeks. I haven&#x27;t been able to use these products long enough to attest to whether they aid in speeding up hair growth. The reasons are because I, like many other reviewers, have experienced significant hair loss with each use, but far more concerning than the hair loss are the large, itchy, red sores I developed at the hairline. These sores took almost two weeks to heal while using only a PH specific shampoo as prescribed by my dermatologist. I found these products to be extremely harsh and damaging. Please use with caution!</li>
    <li> HAIR GROWTH, WONDERFUL PRODUCT</li>
    <li> The product came a little late but i love the product it helps keeps my hair from being tangled and no breakage</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leaves my hair smelling amazing all day, and my hair is super soft after using it!! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a month, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s helped my hair grow yet, but it definitely feels/looks healthier!!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Don&#x27;t buy this on amazon... you can get it for $7 at Walmart!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this will grow my hair but I haven&#x27;t noticed that it looks any better. it is about the same as any other leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> My 13 yr.old daughter who has very curly hair asked that i order this product again because she really likes it. It must work for her, so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this leave-in conditioner along with the shampoo and conditioner. While I am not going to be continuing the use of the shampoo and conditioner due to my hair falling out, I am going to keep this and use it every once in a while. It makes my hair feel nice and soft, even when using it with other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> Really helps with the static caused by a dry winter.</li>
    <li> i was looking at this product for awhile on amazon, and i finally decided to get it. i found this awesome stuff at ulta beauty for only $6.99, not too shabby. i used it the next day after i took a shower. first of all, the product smells truly AMAZING!!! and it made my hair really soft and shiny and detaingled all the knots, and i just wrote this review right after i took the shower. so i cant tell you the growing results yet but i would be happy to writw another review to tell you guys. im telling u... this is stuff is pretty cool.</li>
    <li> One of the best products to condition your hair, without leaving a film on  your scalp or any residue that may cause dandruff.</li>
    <li> When I got it and unboxed it I tried it. I fell in love with the smell, then fell in love with how it made my hair baby soft. I love this product, and will buy more when I start running low on it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s growing faster, but it feels healthier.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product. It breaks my scalp break out into weird bumps and makes it extremely itchy.</li>
    <li> This brand is amazing at everything! I especially love this one in particular though. For me and my hair type. (I have long hair. Straight. Never frizzy. Never greasy. No dandruff type hair.) This works wonderful! I waited a month to write a review to see if it would help grow my hair more. I&#x27;m going for a mermaid look. Lol. It does really work!! And it smells great!! It makes my hair shiny and smooth. After I get out of the shower every other day I dry off my hair to wear its not soaking wet. Then I spray it along the roots and brush it through. Love it. 😊</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair so I must use a leave in conditioner all the time or my hair will literally turn into a nest. I love how I can spritz this stuff all over my hair. I love the smell, it&#x27;s not sticky and leaves my hair smooth, shiny and soft. It doesn&#x27;t harden up your hair like some other leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve used. I purchased this from my local walmart for almost $5.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy but does moisturize and make your hair soft. Spray is a little too pointed for me, but the product is worth the effort it takes to rub it in a little.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so after just rinsing I spray Way to Grow Leave in Conditioner onto my hair, comb through and then style whichever way I want.  I can add styling product with this leave in conditioner or just let air dry.  This product does not feel greasy or sticky, just leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this very long so I don&#x27;t know how well it&#x27;s working yet. I do, howeve, like the smell and the way it leaves my hair feeling soft!</li>
    <li> Love it so much I even got the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> when it was packaged, it wasnt closed all the way, so it made a mess all in the envlope o,O should really make sure the cap part is twisted on fully and tight before packaging!</li>
    <li> Excellent leave in conditioner and detangler. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all greasy. I use everyday!</li>
    <li> I just bought this and the shampoo and used it the same night.  I woke up with bumps on my head that are very sore.  When I sprayed the conditioner in after my shower it wasn&#x27;t a mist like action, it was a straight line right onto my scalp.  Yes, I did try moving the red lever around but still got the same results.  After I could feel my hair was dry  I touched my hair and it was like I sprayed my hair with hair spray.  This made me wonder if I bought the wrong thing but nope it says leave in conditioner.  No and I mean zero softness for me.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite NYM products. It works as a good, inexpensive detangler, but I&#x27;m not sure how effective the growth of my hair is after use as my hair takes ages to grow out.</li>
    <li> Adds body to my hair.  Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Quick shipping.</li>
