      <li>Love the smell, the deal 2 for the price of one.</li>
      <li>Smells better than the commercialized variety.</li>
      <li>This citronella oil is extremely potent.</li>
      <li>Works OK with diffuser.</li>
      <li>and I will be able to still utilize this product despite the &amp;#34;green/grassy&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I have still had to rely on stronger stuff, but I think this is an ok product</li>
      <li>It seems to work okay from what I see...</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>Pleased with how fast it got to my house, and the price was great.</li>

      <li>Super potent.</li>
      <li>I use Citronella Oil in a blend of essential oils and witch hazel for spray mosquito repellant, it works great.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the bottle the smell filled my kitchen.</li>
      <li>Fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Works great mixed with oil (almond or olive) as an insect repellant.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Though other \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; or aromatic oils also repel bugs, in my opinion the citronella does the best job of any others, and it truly smells much milder with this method than buying a product that has it as an ingredient, most of which make you smell like a patio candle.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is very strong and smells pure.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!! :)</li>
      <li>Just used this product in some of my lotions and love the smell, don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot either!</li>
      <li>so excited</li>
      <li>It is great for our long summers.</li>
      <li>One of the best Citronella scents I&#x27;ve smelled in a long time ... natural ... not over powering, but clean.  </li>
      <li>it is good mixed with (like Lemon/Lemongrass)</li>
      <li>True to its namesake.  </li>
      <li>This came quickly and was just what I ordered.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild.</li>
      <li>Among my (Now) essential oils, citronella, eucalyptus and peppermint has the most potent smell.</li>
      <li>Received quickly.  </li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is a high quality potent citronella oil.  </li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t strong enough for you add more citronella oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We definitely use this in making out own bug spray/lotions for ourselves and for friends.  </li>
      <li>Has a very very strong scent, but I&#x27;ve now made several bottles of bug spray, and it&#x27;s done the job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the best Citronella scents I&#x27;ve smelled in a long time ... natural ... not over powering, but clean.  I would buy this scent again. CandleScience has the best scents I&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
    <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
    <li> I use a drop on my feet and around on the porch to stop the attack of mosquitoes.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with product and shipping</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re just starting to use more essential oils and this one came very highly recommended....we&#x27;ll see how it works!</li>
    <li> Im so excited My essential oil arrived and well package. Love the smell, the deal 2 for the price of one. This will last me for this summer. I can&#x27;t wait to make my own non chemical bug spray.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this company stay stronger because most of their products are Good quality and very affordable.  I highly recommend &amp;#34;now foods&amp;#34; to&lt;br /&gt;Other people.</li>
    <li> my great grand mother always put citronella oil on us kids when we visited her farm.&lt;br /&gt;just dab it on like perfume a drop or two goes a long way</li>
    <li> Added a few drops to sweet almond oil in small bottles with droppers (amazon sells them) and now the teens have their own personal bottles of insect repellents. They love it. The scent is mild.</li>
    <li> Love it going to make homemade candles with it</li>
    <li> I actually despise the scent of citronella, but I needed some oils to make some anti-mosquito candles at home. This stuff does the job well enough in candles, but I&#x27;ve actually noticed that the bugs keep away from me more whenever I dab light amounts on my wrists, ankles, knees, and shoulders. (Like how women used to apply perfume, way back when.)&lt;br /&gt;I love that for the price, you get two 1 oz containers, which actually last QUITE a while!</li>
    <li> 1 spray bottle (old OFF bottle?)&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp Citronella oil&lt;br /&gt;2 tbsp Olive oil&lt;br /&gt;Fill rest with water.&lt;br /&gt;Shake and spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it isn&#x27;t strong enough for you add more citronella oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps them OFF of you because the citronella bothers their feet. Smells better than the commercialized variety. Doesn&#x27;t plasticize on your skin and disrupt hormone receptors. And is natural and safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go outside!</li>
    <li> Whew, if you want a 100% Citronella essential oil, this is it. Use sparingly its potent</li>
    <li> I just dont like the smell, there is something subtle and not pleasant in this oil, gives me a little naussea, sorry to be so honest, it might not be your case. Works OK with diffuser. I may consider using it as a repellent mixed with body lotion.</li>
    <li> The internet recommends this be used as a humane way to get rid of stray cats. I will admit it worked for a while but the fragrance left quickly. They came back but it did initially work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use in homemade mosquito repellent.  I used it along with lavender, lemon and tea essential oils.  The fragrance and feel of the repellent was much better and safer than store bought repellents.</li>
    <li> I use this product to make my own mosquito repellent.. It works but I need to pour about 30% more drops than with other brands.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great product. You need this.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my homemade insect repellant.</li>
    <li> Kinda obnoxious smelling but my mom likes it. I haven&#x27;t tried it for mosquito repelling yet but will update if it blows my mind.</li>
    <li> GREAT DEAL! 2 for 1  :)</li>
    <li> Best way to get Mosquitos away!</li>
    <li> Great Product. Works well keeping the bugs away.</li>
    <li> Works great as an insect repellant when diluted in distiller water.  Great mixed with lemongrass essential oil too!</li>
    <li> No me gustó, me equivoque al pedirlos</li>
    <li> Works great as bug repelent! Its one of the only things that works against the no see em bugs in Florida!</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It smells great, works great in my diffuser, and was delivered quickly.  I only gave it 3 out of 5 stars because it is difficult to poor into a diffuser or a bath tub because there isn&#x27;t a stopper at the top. I have to use a medicine dropper for it which I think wastes a lot of the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap Citronella that I use for bugs, it&#x27;s not pure so don&#x27;t use it as such</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Received quickly.  Great product.  Smells more pleasant than others I&#x27;ve used.  Works well in diffuser and also on my skin.</li>
    <li> This citronella oil is extremely potent. I bought it for diy insect repellent-making. Two ounces is probably all I will ever need in my lifetime.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality potent citronella oil.  Be careful not to use too much, this is strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love NOW products. They are consistently high quality and a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citronella oil isn&#x27;t for everyone. I don&#x27;t know  if I will use it again.</li>
    <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like this very much. She does like Citronella though.</li>
    <li> mix this with white vinegar into spray bottle (32oz) for horses, dogs and people.  works great for all flies, mosquitos, also found zero ticks this summer on dogs, horses etc.&lt;br /&gt;put it on pretty thick with sprayer and it did last along time on horses and dogs, but of course still use the face mask for horses.</li>
    <li> the smell made me sick. It was so overwhelming and the house stunk for days. A tiny dab will do for most things. I made candles and the recipe called for the whole bottle per candle. OMG eww.</li>
    <li> Super potent. I bought three and they are lasting a really long time. Great for putting on your screens if you have flying bug problems. Combined with burning tea tree oil, you&#x27;ll never see flying bugs in the house.</li>
    <li> Fabulous.  Smells exactly like citronella leaves.  True to its namesake.  Did not disappoint!  So far, every single NOW foods product I have purchased have been a terrific buy.</li>
    <li> I use Citronella Oil in a blend of essential oils and witch hazel for spray mosquito repellant, it works great.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Pleased with how fast it got to my house, and the price was great. I will definitely recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I ordered citronella oil and I got rose hip oil!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love them all real deal at supper good prices . Would. Bye again  and recommend  to others bigger bottles save me because I use them for alot of things</li>
    <li> Put this on my legs, keeps the bugs away for a few hours. Put a few drops in a spray bottle with some water and keep it in your purse. It&#x27;s super effective!</li>
    <li> I tried making an oil mix spray for mosquito repellant since I live in the woods. I have a bunch of herbs and such on my back deck and going out to grab some lead me to come back in (five minutes later) with at least 5-10 new bites. I was sick of spraying myself down with deet for such a short trip outside so I bought this stuff. It seems to work okay from what I see... but it is very strong and will linger for a very long time. I&#x27;m not 100% sure if it works excellent due to me not being out there over a long period of time but the initial application seems to keep the bugs away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and my boyfriend. Keeps him away, too.</li>
    <li> I have used this and it works great.  I only use essential oils externally and in home made cleaning recipes and I have had no problems with any Now Food essential oils.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Does exactly as I needed it to, keeps away the bugs. Has a very very strong scent, but I&#x27;ve now made several bottles of bug spray, and it&#x27;s done the job. I&#x27;d definitely order again!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the better products by NOW, been using for years and makes a real difference compared to other like products. The price and service from Amazon makes it an easy choice.  I&#x27;ve used it as part of a insect repellent recipe and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This came quickly and was just what I ordered. I am using it to put in candles and a spray for mosquito repellent (paired with peppermint oil). It worked great this summer and am glad for the amount (2 bottles) so that I will definitely have enough for next year too. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Added some of this citronella oil plus some orange oil and perfume to my body lotion, and the mosquitos hate it. Haven&#x27;t been bitten once since I started using it.</li>
    <li> reading other reviews I mix it in baby oil to discourage bugs. I have still had to rely on stronger stuff, but I think this is an ok product</li>
    <li> I really like the value and quality of the Now brand.  We use this in outdoor candles and and some time I also use it topically as a bug repellant.</li>
    <li> Helps keeps the mosquitos away.  It use it in candles and in home made insect spray</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to help with the mosquito problem!</li>
    <li> This came well packed (all of my NOW products have come unbroken and well packaged).  I really do like the smell, it&#x27;s sweet/citrusy and it does have a grassy sort of smell to it, that I realize I don&#x27;t really like.  BUT, the bottle shows oils it is good mixed with (like Lemon/Lemongrass) which I have and I think this will be perfect for an oil diffuser or a room spray so and I will be able to still utilize this product despite the &amp;#34;green/grassy&amp;#34; smell.  Only rated a 4 because I didn&#x27;t like the grassy smell. Not the quality of product.  Give this a go!</li>
    <li> Used with other essential oils to make homemade natural bug spray. Works great and smells good too. I would highly recommended.</li>
    <li> So excited to add this to my bug spray mixture!  I hate harsh smells and chemicals, so this is a strong smell, but when mixed with my other ingredients it is great way to keep away bugs!</li>
    <li> We definitely use this in making out own bug spray/lotions for ourselves and for friends.  Works great!</li>
    <li> It did what it supposed to do , I probably should have spent a littl emore and get the organic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tdid the job , I mixed to make and anti-moquitoes mix in the summer.  Probably should have spent a littl emore and get the organic one.  However, It did the job and  the price was ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KarlaC</li>
    <li> Great as insect repellent, specially mosquitoes. I live in a Ecuador, where&amp;#60; if you have seen the news is an epidemic of a virus named Chicungunya, it is transmitted by mosquitoes, and this essential oil, has helped me keep them away. I use it in my ultrasonic diffuser, and that&#x27;s it. no mosquitoes that could make us sick</li>
    <li> Works great mixed with oil (almond or olive) as an insect repellant.</li>
    <li> Been using Now Foods essential oils for years now, they never have an off smell to them, and always do the job they were purchased for well.</li>
    <li> worked well for soap making. One was cracked open and leaking though. Not sure if it was the mail carrier though.</li>
    <li> This keeps the mosquito vampires away O_o  I Used it in my oil lamp in the summer really great stuff .... smelly but it works well.</li>
    <li> Works for me. I spend a lot of time in my garden and now I am not on the mosquito menu anymore. I add one drop of the oil to a silicone rubber wristband (into the zip- lock storage package where I keep it) whenever the smell gets less and one rub to my outdoor shirt. It does smell strong!</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s Citronella oil Lol</li>
    <li> my kids were getting eaten up by mosquitos,  I never got a single bite and I only sprayed a little on my arms, diluted heavily with water and lavender essential oil</li>
    <li> Great product!! Great Value, and it definitely does the job! I bought this for insect repellent which I have a device on my front porch that is a tabletop lantern type with an absorbent &#x27;sponge like&#x27; disk inside it; just a few drops on the sponge, close the top and switch it on, it has a small fan that helps distribute the aroma and I have not had a problem with insects at all!!! Highly recommend this product!! :)</li>
    <li> Great quality, price, and size! We use it to make our own bug spray.</li>
    <li> Unbearable smell. I had another brand before, it was so pleasant. This one give me headache.</li>
    <li> Good quality and price, perfect for bug repellent.</li>
    <li> Anyone who is concerned about the use of chemicals in commercial bug sprays.  Just mix a few drops of citronella oil, witch hazel and some distilled water (and you will need to mix with water because man, it&#x27;s strong!) into one of those tiny mist bottles and the bugs won&#x27;t go near you.  Just be careful not to make the scent too concentrated or no one else will want to go near you either.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s excellent as a natural bug repellent.</li>
    <li> It really helps again Mosquitos.</li>
    <li> Made my own insect repellant with this. It works great. I&#x27;ll be getting it again.</li>
    <li> i LOVE NOW essential oils! Great for my Al Natural bug replellants</li>
    <li> I purchased this for making homemade Bug Spray. It seems to work. Has the clear &amp;#34;Citronella&amp;#34; Candle smell. Much cheaper that buying them.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money I used it in my homemade candles.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for competitive pricing when purchasing my oils and this was a excellent deal. I love the smell as well as my family. Perfect to add to lotions to keep the bugs away.</li>
    <li> product arrived timely and intact</li>
    <li> Good quality product.  Packed well.  Shipped quickly.  I use a few drops diluted in water to help clean spots where a male cat has marked then I dry the spot well.  It helps.  Please keep it out of the paws and hands of little ones.</li>
    <li> Great product for keeping the Mosquitos at bay. I mix it with witch hazel, some almond oil, and lemon eucalyptus oil!</li>
    <li> The NOW citronella oil is a terrific product for making your own personal insect (particularly mosquito) repellent in the summer, and at this price for two you can make yourself two small bottles of it.  Just use any small pump bottle (I re-use other repellent product bottles which have been used up, like Cutter and Repel, or else buy the cheap travel size spray bottles in the dollar aisle), empty one of these 1 oz bottles entirely into it, then pour any oil of your choice such as olive, baby, almond etc. into the remainder of the bottle.  Shake the contents, and you are ready to apply to your skin.  Though other \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; or aromatic oils also repel bugs, in my opinion the citronella does the best job of any others, and it truly smells much milder with this method than buying a product that has it as an ingredient, most of which make you smell like a patio candle.  It cannot be applied by itself because it is too strong and is not recommended, but combined with an oil (I use olive) and mixed, it is absorbed by your body and the smell is very faint and extremely non-offensive to others.</li>
    <li> Works well  as a bug repellent, I even used it to make my own homemade bug repellent for the dog</li>
    <li> Among my (Now) essential oils, citronella, eucalyptus and peppermint has the most potent smell. I bought this to use a mosquito deterrent.</li>
    <li> Use this with the Cedarwood, mix em up in your own Witch Hazel and make your own good buy spray.  Our daughter is just 3 and it works fine.  At all costs, avoid Lemongrass in your bug spray, it is the number one attractant for bees...</li>
    <li> We use this oil to mix with peppermint as a natural tick repellent for our dogs and it works great,.</li>
    <li> We mix a few drops in a water spray bottle and spray around the trim of the floor and in front of the doors. It works at deterring insects from coming in and the ones that do die pretty quickly or at least become very slow and disoriented. Works on all the insects we have struggled with including spiders, roaches, and bees. The smell is pleasant also.</li>
    <li> Quality citronella for the price, works well to make my own bug repellent for pets and humans.</li>
    <li> Received in timely manner.  Great product</li>
    <li> I put it in salt shakers and set it around. It is as good as any candle and no fire.</li>
    <li> I use s lot of citronella. I make my own Bug off spray.  It is great for our long summers.</li>
    <li> Just arrived. Very strong smell so it should work great for my bug repellent candle project. My only problem was that though both bottles were completely wrapped in bubble wrap they had also both leaked a lot and the entire bottle of both were covered in oil and so were my hands from touching them. Also one of the bottles does not smell like citronella like the other bottle does, I don&#x27;t know what it smells like but it&#x27;s not the citronella smell which the other bottle does have (I don&#x27;t know if I would&#x27;ve noticed if I hadn&#x27;t had the other to compare it to).  Also, it&#x27;s prime but I didn&#x27;t get it in 2 days, in case you needed to know that.  I ordered it 9/22/14 and received it between 10/1-3/14 (variability because it was shipped USPS and I had to go to post office to pick it up which I couldn&#x27;t do until 10/4 and I also received other packages between 1-3 so I&#x27;m not sure which one of the tickets I found in my mailbox it was for to determine exactly which day it arrived.  I could find out but I&#x27;m lazy).</li>
    <li> Citronella.  What more can I say? Nice mellow aroma, not waxy smelling. I haven&#x27;t used it for soap making yet, but I hope it lives up to its initial impression.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very strong and smells pure. I am highly satified and so happy that I bought two! thanksmuch!</li>
    <li> We make our own bug off spray and this is the best value for price I have found</li>
    <li> Just used this product in some of my lotions and love the smell, don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot either! Great product!  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I love that I can use this along with some other oils to make a homemade bug spray! No more chemicals for my baby!</li>
    <li> I used this to make bug spray, which worked well. The product has a very strong scent. When I opened the bottle the smell filled my kitchen. It has worked great in the recipe.</li>
    <li> I use this in an oil mix and take it with me when I go take my dogs exploring on my land. Mosquitos hate this stuff and it also repels other stupid bugs. I sometimes mix this with lemongrass and cedar. It works better than commercial bug repellents&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price! REALLY helps with keeping the bugs away. A few drops of this with water in a spray bottle is WAY cheaper than bug spray, less toxic, and works better. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I mix several oils together on a recipe from a company that has since gone out of business. I have used NOW for years. It is very dependable.</li>
    <li> exactly what it is and  what I ordered, very happy</li>
