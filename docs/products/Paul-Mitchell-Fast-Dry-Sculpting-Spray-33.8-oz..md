    <li> A very good price--very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The ONLY stuff that holds fine hair in place in high humidity!!!</li>
    <li> I have short hair but still like a spray to keep my hair in place.  This product works very well and I have been using it for a few years.  Has a clean aroma and brushes or shampoos out easily.</li>
    <li> I first bought this brand of hairspray at my hair dresser shop and she only has this big bottle sometimes. I shower at night, spray my hair when it is wet and style it. I can re curl my hair in the morning and give it a light spray and my hair holds up all day. The hairspray doesn&#x27;t leave a build up and smells good !!!  THIS IS WORTH BUYING  !!</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell has great products and here&#x27;s another one I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for at least 20 years.  It holds well and washed out easily.  It is indeed fast drying.  In contradistinction to aerosol hair spray, this does not leave a large  cloud of spray in the air when you use it.</li>
    <li> Have used this daily for years. No build up, no alcohol. Good price, prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I needed a refill of the Fast Sculpting Spray and didn&#x27;t need a pump sprayer, so was looking for a reasonable price for a large quantity.  Came promptly with Amazon Prime.  I transfer it to my smaller pump sprayer when I travel.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and does not stink like regular hair spray.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine hair. I have used this product for at least 25 years. My hairdresser started me on it and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. I&#x27;ve tried others and they just don&#x27;t do the same job. I will be very unhappy if this product is discontinued or they see fit to change the ingredients which companies have a habit of doing from time to time.</li>
    <li> Great product! Both my husband and I use it. Perfect for short hair.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years and years. Gives enough hold without crust-ing my hair and without any shine. A great finishing spray after using pomade.</li>
    <li> This was quickly shipped.  It is exactly what I wanted.  If i need any more I will definitely get it here.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  i get a good hold and it isn&#x27;t real stiff and doesn&#x27;t look artificial.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Light but works, now I get the refill size and keep on hand to refill my little purse size.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t live without this stuff, doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, smells good, and holds amazing, i will never get anything else.</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell is the only hairspray I like.  It holds well and lasts for several hours.  I would like to try their volume hairspray.</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell&#x27;s products have always met my expectation and this product was no different.  I will continue to purchase them.</li>
    <li> I always use Paul Mitchell and this price was super competitive and I didn&#x27;t have to go to the stores.....shopping on-line, love it.</li>
    <li> My wife has valued this Paul Mitchell hair spray for herself for many years.  She likes to keep me out of it so it will last longer. Amazon seems to be a good source - better than hair salon prices.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product and has had troubles finding a place to purchase it. I looked on Amazon and found it and you made my wife happy. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and the way it works :)&lt;br /&gt;A++++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for over 25 years and keep coming back to it.  I haven&#x27;t found anything I like better.  Glad that some things stay the same.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and use this product as I blow it dry after shampooing.  It keeps frizzies at a minimum.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray I have ever used.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this for years. I love the light hold , doesn&#x27;t gunk up your hair, I&#x27;ll spray my hair lightly prior to using my curling iron, then very light again before combing out my style ( I have a lot of very fine hair so it doesn&#x27;t hold up well ) By doing this my style stays  for the day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for years.  It holds very well in windy conditions but also washes completely out of your hair.  I use the larger size bottle to refill my pump bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product for an awesome price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years!  Love it and my hair is very hard to hold a style.</li>
    <li> Have used for years, one of the few that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of smell - doesn&#x27;t interfere if you wear perfume!  Nice hold, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>

    <li> I have used it for years, and will continue to do so.  Economically priced.  We generally use this size to refill smaller spray containers.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  It is not heavy or sticky, and it can be used on wet/damp hair. As with any hair spray, I brush it out before bed. I only wish it came in a travel size.</li>
    <li> Excellent price on a basic necessity I&#x27;d been overpaying for</li>
    <li> Product was watered down!! Would never purchase again. I have gotten this all my life and recently this product has been disappointing!! Trying to scam the public, I know the difference in smell and color of product and it was defiantly watered down.</li>
    <li> I love the product, the price was great and it was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy the large 33.8oz container to refill the smaller spray bottles. The word Unisex in the title threw me off a bit, but this is the very same product as [[ASIN:B002RS6K1G Paul Mitchell Fast Dry Sculpting Spray, 8.5-Ounces Bottle]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great on my permed hair. I use it in conjunction with [[ASIN:B002RS6L10 Paul Mitchell Round Trip Curl Definer, 6.8-Ounces Bottle]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is baby fine &amp; doesn&#x27;t have any body. I was surprised how well this sculpting spray lifts my hair. I spray it near the roots to add volume then I scrunch my curls into place. Sometimes I&#x27;ll lift my hair with a comb too. It stays wet long enough for me to work with my curls &amp; doesn&#x27;t cause a build-up that is hard to shampoo out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this sculpting spray even though my perm has grown out.  It does a great job of providing some lift &amp; a little volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> HOLDS STYLE WITHOUT BEING CRUNCHY AND BRUSHES OUT PERFECTLY. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have used this for at least 15 years.  nothing works better.</li>
