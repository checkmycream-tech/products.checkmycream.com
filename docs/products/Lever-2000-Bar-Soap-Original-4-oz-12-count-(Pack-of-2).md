<li> it turns to a soft mess.</li>
<li> The individual boxes were crushed and soap distorted.</li>
<li> However, our bar dish sits in an area where it gets a lot of water from the shower and if this soap is constantly getting wet from shower</li>

<li> It has lasted for a very long time!</li>

<li> other soaps and body washes can have overpowering scents, giving the feeling like you are bathing in perfume.</li>
<li> The shipper had this and the other items to me within 3 days.</li>
<li> My husband won&#x27;t use any other soap.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that the shape of the bar is not very conducive to handling as it is very round and almost football shaped.</li>
<li> I would however prefer that the manufacturer would use less packaging.</li>
<li> I myself am not a soap user because I have very dry skin; however, I have used it in the past.</li>
<li> I ordered this thru Subscribe and Save thinking it costs a little less than I could get it at WalMart</li>

<li> and you won&#x27;t spend unnecessary effort trying to get to every part of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No where nead as good as pure rain bars.</li>
    <li> This is decent soap.  For $17.89 shipped with subscription, that&#x27;s only $.75 per bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well, fresh scent, could do a better job moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update. I bought 4 packs and I still have 6 bars left!  I shower everyday and am the only one who uses this. It has lasted for a very long time! *** 3/16/10 - 2/13/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rotate Olay during the winter.</li>
    <li> PICTURE OF BOX SAYS PERFECTLY FRESH BUT IT IS JUST THE ORIGINAL SCENT YOU CAN GET AT THE STORE. I CANCELLED MY ORDER.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Gets my body clean- my favorite bar soap.  Quick delivery by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know they still made this stuff. Nothing suds up the fellas better!</li>
    <li> I love this product it smells great and it gives u the extra clean feeling..its great for the whole family to</li>
    <li> My husbands elbows used to crack open every winter.  Since we started using this soap, probably 5 years, his elbows have not cracked even once.  Yet, the soap doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy or oily.  It is a great soap to use everyday.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect bar soap for someone who isn&#x27;t looking for over the top scent or frills. It is a very no-nonsense cleanser bar that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I have a tendency to gravitate towards bar soap over liquid or foam soap just because I like feeling something tangible when I wash my hands. This is the perfect bar for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using in the shower, I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use this product is with a wash cloth. Simply wet your wash cloth, Rub the bar into the wash cloth until you have a healthy lather going. Then use the wash cloth to wash your body. The bar lathers quite well so I haven&#x27;t once had to use the bar again after applying it to the cloth. If you prefer to use the bar itself, you&#x27;ll find that it lathers quite well on skin and you won&#x27;t spend unnecessary effort trying to get to every part of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is also very light and pleasant and doesn&#x27;t leave too much on your skin after washing the lather off. My only complaint is that the shape of the bar is not very conducive to handling as it is very round and almost football shaped. But that&#x27;s just nit-picking.</li>
    <li> This is a good, clean-scented, everyday soap. My family loves it.  I myself am not a soap user because I have very dry skin; however, I have used it in the past. Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t dry me out as much (like most other soaps), but it still left my skin tight and flakey. As for the rest of the family, it does the job and gets their stink out.  I just love the convenience of having health and beauty products delivered right to my doorstep.  What a timesaver!! The price is comparable to the drugstores.  This is one of the many items which I&#x27;ve set up on the Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> Clean and simple soap. Great value</li>
    <li> I bought these for a great price as a donation item for a food bank. They were thrilled to get soap so many folks need soap and this shipped directly there so it was easy.</li>
    <li> Lever 2000 Moisturizing Bar, Perfectly Fresh Original , 4 Ounce Bars in 12 Count Packages (Pack of 2) for $15. The lever 2000 soap doesn&#x27;t have a lot of fragrance and that&#x27; s how I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially these came in 4.5Oz and now in 4 Oz but the price has been the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t melt very quickly in water and one soap seems to last for about a month or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, recommend them and stock them if they are under $12.</li>
    <li> This bar soap appears to do what is advertised. No problems with the soap. The scent is mild. I would however prefer that the manufacturer would use less packaging. Especially for when the item is purchased in bulk.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thru Subscribe and Save thinking it costs a little less than I could get it at WalMart not realizing ths was a 12 pack not an 8 pack like WalMart sells so that makes it an even better deal on my favorite soap.  I am going to see if I can order ALL my favorites thru Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  I not only smells great it&#x27;s really good at NOT leaving soap residue all over the shower.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s soap. I open the box, easily, and lather up and rinse off. The shipper had this and the other items to me within 3 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of soaps and this is my all around favorite for washing face, body and even hair. It lathers and rinses well. And with S&amp;amp;S, this is a great price (same as the Big Box stores), and about half the price of NYC stores.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap.  When my two grandsons visited us last summer, they used this soap and now they have it at home.</li>
    <li> I love Lever 2000 soaps. They make my skin smooth. But this batch is not as good as the ones I bought from a supermarket and I have to rinse for a longer time to wash off the residuals. Maybe the ones in the supermarket are not the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; type sold here.</li>
    <li> My husband won&#x27;t use any other soap.  He loves this one. HeE gets  really geasy hands, this soap  rally cuts the grease.</li>
    <li> Great price but soap tends to run out very fast.</li>
    <li> If you like this soap and fragrance, this was a great buy.  Good delivery, timely.  Got enough soap to last for awhile now!</li>
    <li> Great price. I like to have extra on hand so for the price it was great to buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this soap, we now probably have enough to last for the rest of his life (or at least yrs. and yrs. to come). It was a good price though.</li>
    <li> Great smell! Can work for men and women! Lasts a long time. Worth the price</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap and it cleans well. However, our bar dish sits in an area where it gets a lot of water from the shower and if this soap is constantly getting wet from shower it does not stay hard- it turns to a soft mess.</li>
    <li> Stocked up on a supply of these before moving overseas. This soap has a clean, fresh scent and helps to balance skin moisture in a way that is unmatched by other brands,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other soaps and body washes can have overpowering scents, giving the feeling like you are bathing in perfume. Or they can be so moisture rich to be almost greasy. Not this product, just try it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My order contained 24 bars of soap...at 4oz each that&#x27;s six pounds of soap. We are very happy with our order. I didn&#x27;t pay that much attention to the scent. It smells like Lever 2000 original - it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Great value for the $$$ as compared to the local grocery.  Am all set now for quite awhile for bath soap.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this soap its a very light clean scent. I also like the aloe bars but it doesnt have as good as a scent as the orignial I wish they would add aloe to this bar without changing the scent.</li>
    <li> Arrived damaged! The individual boxes were crushed and soap distorted. The soap seems old.</li>
    <li> Great item. Feel refreshed using it and makes you smell clean after your shower. My family has always loved using Lever 2000 but through Amazon the price for this couldn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> No overpowering perfumes and does the job well. Used to buy at Costco but they stopped carrying this at my store. Was glad to find it on Amazon for the same price.</li>
    <li> It removes all dirt and grease. I don&#x27;t have any problems of dry skin after using it. After working on the car I don&#x27;t have to use hand cleaner then normal soap in the shower.</li>
    <li> used this soap for years bought a large quanity at low price and free shipping what not to like?&lt;br /&gt;Will buy in future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lever 2000 since &amp;#34;2000&amp;#34; was a futuristic thing.  Leaves skin clean with no noticeable film or scent.</li>
    <li> GREAT SMELL.  IT&#x27;S ALL WE USE</li>
    <li> Good value for a soap that is not as harsh and drying on the skin as many other soaps.</li>
    <li> If you use Lever 2000 this is a bulk buy to save with. Being a smaller item not a storage problem and of course gotta love the free 2 day shipping for prime members</li>
    <li> this is the only soap the men in our home will use&#x3D; original only..  not too perfumey, but works and cleans great.  You get Tons of soap, and you don&#x27;t have to think about running to the store.  for soap, anyway!</li>
