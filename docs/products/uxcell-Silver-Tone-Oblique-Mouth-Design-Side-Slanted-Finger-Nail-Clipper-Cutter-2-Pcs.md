### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>these are the best cuticle Clippers on the market.</li>
      <li>These are perfect for clipping baby and toddler nails.</li>
      <li>Not the best quality.</li>
      <li>These feel like very good and sturdy clippers.  </li>
      <li>Even with that in mind, still a great buy at an awesome price!</li>
      <li>They look beautiful, but they should have concentrated on nail clipping instead of looks.</li>
      <li>These work great.  </li>
      <li>These work great.</li>
      <li>All great factors.</li>
      <li>I think these work great.</li>
      <li>so I was happy to find them online.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great for toes and fingers.</li>
      <li>Happy with my purchase, good price for two, and as good as anything I would have picked up in a store.</li>
      <li>but they are good.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re good.</li>
      <li>but otherwise, it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>I made the mistake and read all of the good  reviews.</li>
      <li>The price was good for two</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>LOVE these trimmers!</li>
      <li>Great pair of nail clippers; Glad to be able to purchase online with you, being unavailable for purchase in stores</li>
      <li>Nice handle for gripping.</li>
      <li>I had to find some suitable replacements.....</li>
      <li>This nail Clipper is pretty not too great</li>
      <li>I also thought this set was better qualtiy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Glad to have found it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Makes more sense to me than the curved ones.</li>
      <li>But overall, wonderful product.</li>
      <li>They make &#x60;okay&#x27; tweezers.</li>
      <li>Never thought I&#x27;d find better ones at these prices, I&#x27;d be lost without them.</li>
      <li>Glad I found them.</li>
      <li>I love them....</li>
      <li>Well okay, I maybe broke one</li>
      <li>these are ok.</li>
      <li>Having the two types gets the job done better.</li>
      <li>I tried many of these and these didn&#x27;t pan out for us.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rosallini really delivers here, giving you two clippers for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure they are fine.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t cut nails, nor do they effectively cut the cuticle that grows around the side of the nail, which was why I wanted them in the first place.</li>
      <li>not horrible but not bad either.</li>
      <li>The first one seemed blunt, but the second one works perfect.</li>
      <li>and they still work fine.</li>
      <li>They work and they are cheap.</li>
      <li>I held my breath that they would be cheap and fall apart, but</li>
      <li>They were inexpensive with free shipping and arrived in under two weeks from China.</li>
      <li>just okay - one of the clippers didn&#x27;t have a complete smooth &#x27;blade&#x27; on it, so it wasn&#x27;t nice to use.</li>
      <li>I bought a different brand instead &amp; the new one works great!</li>
      <li>I was really excited to find them here and ordered 2 sets.</li>
      <li>This is a perfect choice if you like small inexpensive cuticle cutters.</li>
      <li>Slant edge clippers are my favorite but these that came are not cutting right</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the true.</li>
      <li>If shipping wasn&#x27;t  so much I would have gladly returned them.</li>
      <li>But not bad for this price.</li>
      <li>Super in-expensive.</li>
      <li>Bought these online after, like many reviewers, not being able to find a replacement in local drug stores.</li>
      <li>Not sharp, wouldn&#x27;t cut cuticle, hang nail, warm butter.</li>
      <li>but if you have a tough nail then good luck!!!</li>
      <li>they are worth.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price and wait.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how they shipped a pair of these for $4 with free shipping (from Hong Kong--they must use an importer), but this is a great deal, and I&#x27;ll buy a few more for sure.</li>
      <li>Pretty, angled, garbage.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and were exactly as stated.  </li>
      <li>I was so upset, as I purchased &#x27;several&#x27; sets of them because I love this type of clipper.</li>
      <li>exactly what I have been looking for, I have looked in stores all around town for these</li>
      <li>only thing I wish they had thought of was to place the golden label on the other side of the swiveling piece because it would greatly increase the grip on it.</li>
      <li>Other than that it is a nice product for the price.</li>
      <li>They were exactly as pictured, fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>these are as good as anything I&#x27;ve used in years past.</li>
      <li>Even Amazon didn&#x27;t have affordable versions of these for a while, but after a recent search to see if any new entrants were in the market, I was pleased to find these for a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>But the other one is fine, it&#x27;s nice to use for smaller toenails or trims.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Dulls quickly (within a month of use)&lt;br /&gt;Tension loosens quickly (within several weeks of use)&lt;br /&gt;Had one of the handles snap in to two pieces during use</li>
      <li>I have been needing new slat-tipped clippers, and they are SO hard to find I was happy to see them.</li>
      <li>These are great for clipping tough toenails</li>
      <li>I brought it, used it on my nails, apparently it broke right when I tried to cut it!</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Tearing is a real issue when using this product.</li>
      <li>They work very well.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get in as close as I&#x27;d like to really groom the cuticles</li>
      <li>I just tossed them in the trash, they didn&#x27;t cost much and that is exactly&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sometimes you really do get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Do you know how much these things go for in the store?  </li>
      <li>The tip is very blunt</li>
      <li>Works much beter then traditonal clippers.</li>
      <li>the other kinds I got are much better.</li>
      <li>Very Cheap, not worth the effort to explain.</li>
      <li>Needs a longer handle to reach full potential.</li>
      <li>You can see what you&#x27;re doing SO much better than with typical straight-edge nail clippers--even the ones made specifically for babies.</li>
      <li>Works well and is a bit larger than most similar tools . . .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these twice, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the ones I ordered about a year ago were a little larger and seemed to be of better quality than this latest iteration.</li>
      <li>They are sturdy and seem to be good quality, however they are not sharp enough and do not cut as well as other clippers.</li>
      <li>These are a bit larger than what I had in mind, but they are sturdy and the price was right.</li>
      <li>a little large to be used on fingers if you ask me, and i have huge ones.</li>
      <li>bought two, one works ok, other is not very sharp, guess you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>but they arrived sharp, fit the hand well and dont slip.</li>
      <li>The design on top is actually a laser-cut gold floral pattern- cheesy but cute.</li>
      <li>Really great for cutting my toe nails and finger nails.  </li>
      <li>These clippers work great for digging into the cuticles and cutting away damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Once you use this style, nothing else will do- not even $30 professional trimmers.</li>
      <li>Even on soft skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These feel like very good and sturdy clippers.  They however are not very sharp!</li>
    <li> i use these clippers to clip my toe nails. I had a toe nail that was bothering me and when I clipped it with the curve It did the trick.</li>
    <li> bought two, one works ok, other is not very sharp, guess you get what you pay for. but would not recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Bought these online after, like many reviewers, not being able to find a replacement in local drug stores. These are larger than my last pair- almost as big as larger toe-nail clippers. The construction is pretty solid, blades seem sharp enough. The design on top is actually a laser-cut gold floral pattern- cheesy but cute. There is a folding file inside. Happy with my purchase, good price for two, and as good as anything I would have picked up in a store.</li>
    <li> It is pretty hard to clip with these. I don&#x27;t have a problem so much with the style, but the biggest issue is they are constantly falling apart when you are trying to clip. The middle piece fell out on one and got lost, so that one is completely unusable.</li>
    <li> These are not even sharp. The will not remotely cut nails or cuticles. Using them is sort of like being hit 45 times in the neck with a blunt axe.</li>
    <li> i was very disappointed these aren&#x27;t even sharp makes my nails jagged very poor quality I would not buy this item</li>
    <li> Do you know how much these things go for in the store?  Buy this and you won&#x27;t regret it.  I don&#x27;t need two, but why not...</li>
    <li> They work and they are cheap. Seem well built, but not very sharp............................ They are adequate, given that these are hard to find here in the US anymore...............</li>
    <li> not as sharp as I expected. but they do work for the purpose they are intended for.</li>
    <li> Poor quality product!</li>
    <li> I use these to cut baby finger nails. The way they are slanted makes it easy to see just how much of the nail you are cutting.</li>
    <li> These suck after a couple of days of using them they are already dull. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality. But not bad for this price.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price and wait.  Angle clippers aren&#x27;t easy to find and the clippers are sharp and should last a long time.  Plus you receive 2 clippers for less than the price of one.  I will purchase these again.  Have purchased other Rosallini products, mostly hair clips and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works well and is a bit larger than most similar tools . . . making it easier to use.  Needs a longer handle to reach full potential.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure these are strong enough to cut my fingernails! I push on the handle completely down and there is a delayed reaction before they attempt to cut.</li>
    <li> Slant edge clippers are my favorite but these that came are not cutting right and I am disappointed in that....the other kinds I got are much better.</li>
    <li> I love them....exactly what I have been looking for, I have looked in stores all around town for these</li>
    <li> I gave them a low rating because they don&#x27;t cut hardly at all. Sorry about the bad review but it&#x27;s the true. I tried many of these and these didn&#x27;t pan out for us.</li>
    <li> These nippers are very dull.  They are so thick at the cutting edge that they do not cut anything.  I do not recommend buying them. No matter how pretty they are, they are useless.</li>
    <li> it is too big for me. description was for 2. Arrived only 1 and had to ask for refund. Even it is not a big deal, but still</li>
    <li> I give it 5 stars because I only use them to trim loose cuticle &amp; skin. Works much beter then traditonal clippers. Using on nails would only dull them &amp; not have a clean cut on soft skin. Having the two types gets the job done better. My fingers/toes are well groomed. I also thought this set was better qualtiy then the one I used to have. Nice handle for gripping. I couldn&#x27;t find these in any store so I am please to oder them on Amaon</li>
    <li> I brought it, used it on my nails, apparently it broke right when I tried to cut it! Well okay, I maybe broke one so I used the second one, I broke it again like what the heck!!! This nail Clipper is pretty not too great but if you have a tough nail then good luck!!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for oblique clipper for some time and know I have them. I like them a lot.Thanks</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and were exactly as stated.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I receive 1 item not 2pcs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a roofer who uses his hands quite a bit with noticeable damages to my nails and cuticles. These clippers work great for digging into the cuticles and cutting away damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a pair before these and lost them. Never thought I&#x27;d find better ones at these prices, I&#x27;d be lost without them.</li>
    <li> Great pair of nail clippers; Glad to be able to purchase online with you, being unavailable for purchase in stores</li>
    <li> Like this product a lot!  I like the &#x27;angled&#x27; nail clipper and it&#x27;s not easily found in&lt;br /&gt;my locale!  Glad to have found it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order more...as needed!</li>
    <li> These clippers aren&#x27;t as sharp as others that I have purchased.</li>
    <li> The price was good for two but these are thick and bulky.  Even though the tips are sharp, its difficult to get to the bottom of your cuticles and they tend to slip out of your hand.</li>
    <li> These clippers have dull blades which result in poor trim capability.  They are not high enough quality for me to buy another pair.</li>
    <li> These are a bit larger than what I had in mind, but they are sturdy and the price was right.</li>
    <li> These are a joke.  They don&#x27;t cut a thing, not even a thread much less a finger nail.  A manufacturer&#x27;s waste of time and money.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> LOVE these trimmers! When they stopped selling the ones I used to get from my local Walgreens and HEB I had to find some suitable replacements.....these did the job!</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t very sharp, but they do get into the area that you want to cut. Also you get two pair for the price of one.</li>
    <li> these are ok. not horrible but not bad either. a little large to be used on fingers if you ask me, and i have huge ones. but they arrived sharp, fit the hand well and dont slip.</li>
    <li> It could have had a fingernail cleaner attached. Other than that it is a nice product for the price.</li>
    <li> These clippers do not clip. It&#x27;s as if you can&#x27;t squeeze hard/tight enough to clip. I was so upset, as I purchased &#x27;several&#x27; sets of them because I love this type of clipper. I do not recommend these clippers to ANYONE.</li>
    <li> Very Cheap, not worth the effort to explain. I just tossed them in the trash, they didn&#x27;t cost much and that is exactly&lt;br /&gt;what they are worth.</li>
    <li> Well I got what I paid for alright! These nail clippers are nice and shiny but unfortunately that&#x27;s where it ends. They are so dull and it&#x27;s frustrating because you&#x27;re expecting it to cut but nothing happens.</li>
    <li> One has to look far and wide for a set of sturdy oblique nail clippers that stay aligned for a long time. The last pair I had(I lost them!) came in a manicure set and I didn&#x27;t want to buy another set just for those clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosallini really delivers here, giving you two clippers for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish they had thought of was to place the golden label on the other side of the swiveling piece because it would greatly increase the grip on it. Even with that in mind, still a great buy at an awesome price!</li>
    <li> Not happy at all. first of all it took 31 days to receive and when I finally got them they were dull and would NOT cut a childs nail.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Doesn&#x27;t get in as close as I&#x27;d like to really groom the cuticles but otherwise, it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Even on soft skin these clippers grip, rather than cut. Tearing is a real issue when using this product. They make &#x60;okay&#x27; tweezers.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a substitute for the slant tip La Cross clippers I&#x27;ve had for years.  These do not exactly compare.  They are great for nails, but terrible for cuticles.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Dulls quickly (within a month of use)&lt;br /&gt;Tension loosens quickly (within several weeks of use)&lt;br /&gt;Had one of the handles snap in to two pieces during use</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how they can make a fingernail clipper which simply can&#x27;t clip a nail. The price should have told me swomething.  They look beautiful, but they should have concentrated on nail clipping instead of looks.</li>
    <li> These clippers are inexpensive but they do work at clipping cuticles.  After reading the other reviews I thought they would break right away but I&#x27;ve had them for a couple of months now and they still work fine.</li>
    <li> This style of cuticle trimmer is great and has become impossible to find in stores. Once you use this style, nothing else will do- not even $30 professional trimmers. I was really excited to find them here and ordered 2 sets. They were inexpensive with free shipping and arrived in under two weeks from China. All great factors. However, the trimmers are very dull- so the cuticles aren&#x27;t \\&quot;cut\\&quot; so much as they are munched and mangled, leaving a rough finish. The rest of the trimmer seems sturdy, so I may try to sharpen them somehow. But odds are, they&#x27;ll all end up in the back of a drawer until I toss them away. My search continues.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these items on at least two occasions because you can no longer find them in department stores and/or drug stores by such manufacturers as Lacrosse, Trim and Revlon. Now they&#x27;re coming out of Hong Kong and quite frankly they are junk.  The cutting edges are very dull and get worse with very little usage.</li>
    <li> wont even cut a cuticle, wish I could still get the originals locally in stores. not worth returning wont buy again</li>
    <li> They work very well.  Took quite a long time getting here...slow boat from China.</li>
    <li> Not sharp enough to cut your cuticles... And mine blades didn&#x27;t line up evenly, so u couldn&#x27;t cut with then even if they were sharp enough.</li>
    <li> These work great. Super in-expensive.</li>
    <li> The actual clipper part ( the mouth or cutters)  are thick and therefore are not able to get in tight places.</li>
    <li> This is very dull ! I made the mistake and read all of the good  reviews. I purchased two packs which equals four dull clippers!</li>
    <li> After waiting a month for these to be shipped from China, I took one out of the package and attempted to trim my nails with no luck.  I&#x27;m a man, if that makes a difference.  These won&#x27;t cut at all, and even if they did, the actually cutting area of the blades is about half the size of a normal clipper.  They&#x27;re Chinese junk, if you ask me.</li>
    <li> The first one seemed blunt, but the second one works perfect. Guess that&#x27;s why you get two, to avoid sending you another later. Anyways, it cuts my nails, and I prefer the slant design rather then the semi-circle ones.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this item for a long time.  Had 1 before when I bought it in Walgreen&#x27;s, but no longer have it.  So I searched everywhere, till I went on Google &amp; found it.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Really great for cutting my toe nails and finger nails.  Makes more sense to me than the curved ones.</li>
    <li> These clippers are easier to use for the corners of your nails.  Now that I&#x27;m used to them I can&#x27;t do without them.</li>
    <li> They are sturdy and seem to be good quality, however they are not sharp enough and do not cut as well as other clippers.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this style of cuticle trimmer seems to be going out of style or availability, in favor of larger and more expensive \\&quot;hand grip\\&quot; cuticle trimmers. I&#x27;ve not seen these small ones (roughly the size of medium nail clippers) in grocery or drug stores in around 3 years. I&#x27;ve probably tried 20 times to find them locally to no avail. Even Amazon didn&#x27;t have affordable versions of these for a while, but after a recent search to see if any new entrants were in the market, I was pleased to find these for a very reasonable price. I&#x27;m not sure how they shipped a pair of these for $4 with free shipping (from Hong Kong--they must use an importer), but this is a great deal, and I&#x27;ll buy a few more for sure. I held my breath that they would be cheap and fall apart, but no . . . these are as good as anything I&#x27;ve used in years past. This is a perfect choice if you like small inexpensive cuticle cutters.</li>
    <li> These flew apart every time I tried to use them. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> These are great for clipping tough toenails</li>
    <li> Not very good&lt;br /&gt;dull</li>
    <li> I bought 2 packs.  So a total of 4.  Every one was blunt.</li>
    <li> They look perfectly fine and stuff, but they&#x27;re SO DULL! They don&#x27;t cut nails, nor do they effectively cut the cuticle that grows around the side of the nail, which was why I wanted them in the first place. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> They were exactly as pictured, fast delivery.  LOUSY clippers. Not sharp, wouldn&#x27;t cut cuticle, hang nail, warm butter. If shipping wasn&#x27;t  so much I would have gladly returned them.</li>
    <li> These were just okay - one of the clippers didn&#x27;t have a complete smooth &#x27;blade&#x27; on it, so it wasn&#x27;t nice to use. But the other one is fine, it&#x27;s nice to use for smaller toenails or trims.</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all....didn&#x27;t work to clip hang nails.</li>
    <li> I have been needing new slat-tipped clippers, and they are SO hard to find I was happy to see them. Sadly the blades are very thick and not at all sharp. No good for the trimming they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> These work great.  Glad I found them.</li>
    <li> Hard to find clippers. Got these and they&#x27;re good. Could be a touch sharper but they are good.</li>
    <li> They are exactly what I was looking for, but unable to fine anywhere else.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I&#x27;m sure they are fine.</li>
    <li> The blades on one of the clippers was so dull it would not cut at all.  The other set was a tiny bit sharper and if I pressed and twisted it managed to make one cut.  Pretty, angled, garbage.</li>
    <li> The tip is very blunt so it won&#x27;t reach tight places.  I bought a different brand instead &amp; the new one works great!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for clipping baby and toddler nails. You can see what you&#x27;re doing SO much better than with typical straight-edge nail clippers--even the ones made specifically for babies. I&#x27;ve ordered these twice, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the ones I ordered about a year ago were a little larger and seemed to be of better quality than this latest iteration. Rosallini - go back to your former design! But overall, wonderful product.</li>
    <li> The clippers are just what I wanted and expected. This type is hard to find in stores now for some reason so I was happy to find them online. They get into smaller places than the regular straight ones do and are easier to manage. If you don&#x27;t have nails that are hard and thick I think these work great.</li>
    <li> these are the best cuticle Clippers on the market. They&#x27;re great for toes and fingers.</li>
