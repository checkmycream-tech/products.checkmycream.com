      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Absolute best mascara.</li>
      <li>I love the look, and I love the price!</li>
      <li>Maybe even better.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump up my eyelashes like other and it looks great!</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t smudge and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on, doesn&#x27;t have a smell, doesn&#x27;t clump, and is easy to take off in the evening.</li>
      <li>I have tried many mascaras, most of them designer, like DiorShow, Benefit, Clinique, Chanel, Lancôme, but I always keep coming back to CoverGirl.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;Very Black\\&quot; is an exceptional color option for darkening blond-ish lashes like mine and really does lengthen and hold a curl very well.</li>
      <li>But the cap cracked the first time I used it --</li>
      <li>Its just as good after a few coats.</li>
      <li>That mascara was good for everyday wear in the office.</li>
      <li>When I open it and pull out the wand I have to scrape so much of it off just to be able to use it.</li>
      <li>My favorite and most dependable for thick and natural lashes!</li>
      <li>Who wants to do that ever time they put their makeup on?</li>
      <li>The mascara is waterproof and the straight brush is my preference.  </li>
      <li>This mascara really does wonders for my eyes.</li>
      <li>I really loved it because it separated my eyelashes, which are thick and curly, and didn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>If you have both short AND thin lashes, CG&#x27;s Lashblast is a much better option.</li>
      <li>My only issue with the brush is that if I&#x27;m not extremely careful, I end up with some brush marks on my upper lid.</li>
      <li>Only one I use and it gives me full thick lashes, every time.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s probably why I don&#x27;t notice the &#x27;super thick.&#x27;</li>
      <li>I absolutely hate when my eyelashes become clumpy, so I was so happy to finally find a mascara that gives my lashes a thick, bold look without creating clumps.</li>

    <li> Absolute best mascara. Only one I use and it gives me full thick lashes, every time. Love it!</li>

    <li> This CoverGirl mascara is perfect! I absolutely hate when my eyelashes become clumpy, so I was so happy to finally find a mascara that gives my lashes a thick, bold look without creating clumps. I love the look, and I love the price! I will definitely be buying this mascara from now on.</li>
    <li> I love it and it was CHEAP!!!  I bought it to see how it does and it does great!  Great price and great product!</li>
    <li> Wears well....comes off with soap and water.</li>
    <li> I will never buy Lancome again after using this. Its just as good after a few coats. Maybe even better.</li>
    <li> I will not use any other type of mascara other than this one! My favorite and most dependable for thick and natural lashes!</li>
    <li> I love it! I use it every day, it makes my eyelashes look thick and long. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It works great .This is a real good mascara for a good price.It does what it should.</li>
    <li> Great mascara can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good mascara.  doesn&#x27;t smudge and easy to apply.  I absolutely hate clumps, so I wipe the brush with a tissue before applying.  That&#x27;s probably why I don&#x27;t notice the &#x27;super thick.&#x27;</li>
    <li> product as described--</li>
    <li> Good quality, awesome price. Nothing fancy but works for me.</li>
    <li> This mascara is terrible. It is too thick and clumps up badly causing the &#x27;tarantula&#x27; look. I do not want my lashes looking like that. It&#x27;s disgusting and I only bought it because they stopped selling my usual mascara (CoverGirl in the thin yellow tube). I bought this one and have regretted it ever since. When I open it and pull out the wand I have to scrape so much of it off just to be able to use it. Who wants to do that ever time they put their makeup on? No me! The product is disgusting and just plain nasty. Avoid this product at all cost!</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best I have used yet. I have tried numerous mascaras only to be disappointed after using them. This mascara really does wonders for my eyes. I have received numerous compliments about this mascara.</li>
    <li> I have tried many mascaras, most of them designer, like DiorShow, Benefit, Clinique, Chanel, Lancôme, but I always keep coming back to CoverGirl. The last few mascara bottles I&#x27;ve had were the CoverGirl Professional in Very Black, which comes in the blue bottle and with a curved or straight brush. That mascara was good for everyday wear in the office. I really loved it because it separated my eyelashes, which are thick and curly, and didn&#x27;t clump. However, I wanted a mascara that adds volume in addition to separating and a little bit of lengthening, so I tried this one. I love it! It&#x27;s easy to put on, doesn&#x27;t have a smell, doesn&#x27;t clump, and is easy to take off in the evening. My only issue with the brush is that if I&#x27;m not extremely careful, I end up with some brush marks on my upper lid. This might be because I have a mono-lid and all mascara brushes tend to do that to me. For the price, I am sticking to this mascara.</li>
    <li> Been my favorite for about 15 years!</li>
    <li> With all the really good reviews I wanted to like it. Unfortunately it was not at all as it was described. I found this mascara to be both clumpy and smeary. Bummer.</li>
    <li> The mascara is waterproof and the straight brush is my preference.  But the cap cracked the first time I used it -- couldn&#x27;t put this in a travel or gym bag.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great! It doesn&#x27;t clump up my eyelashes like other and it looks great! I will continue to buy this mascara since my regular one would clump up my eyelashes a lot.</li>
