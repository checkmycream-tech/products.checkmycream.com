### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>(Especially important since Maybelline discontinued my product!)</li>
      <li>&lt;3 Thank youuuu</li>
      <li>This concealer is simply perfect.</li>
      <li>Reapplication isn&#x27;t needed for quite sometime which is really great!</li>
      <li>The coverage is really great!</li>
      <li>it is a great concealer / cover up.</li>
      <li>so I thought it would be great on my under-eye circles.     </li>
      <li>I bought this because the beauty community raved about it being great and discontinued</li>
      <li>It goes on great over sparse acne around my cheeks, forehead, and chin.</li>
      <li>but besides that, this is an amazing concealer!</li>
      <li>When I put my finger in to feel it, surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t feel like what people said.</li>
      <li>Maybelline is a good brand</li>
      <li>This concealer is great, it has great coverage and goes on smoothly, as I like.</li>
      <li>I gave three stars because it works great and smoothly on everything but under eye circles. &#x27;</li>
      <li>and i thought that it was amazing.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get this concealer because I read a lot of great reviews on it.    </li>
      <li>Very easy to blend over my face.</li>
      <li>SO GLAD</li>
      <li>Like someone else says, it&#x27;s more like peanut butter than mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best concealer that I&#x27;ve ever found and I am stockpiling it so that I will have it in the future.</li>
      <li>It cakes up and seems to make the circles even more noticeable.</li>
      <li>I really love this concealer</li>
      <li>I love this product-</li>
      <li>One thing about the packaging is that it didn&#x27;t have the sticker on top of the lid.</li>
      <li>But I was okay with that</li>
      <li>To start, since it&#x27;s not a liquid, it won&#x27;t squirt out more than you want, and since it&#x27;s not a stick, nothing will break off and become misshapen.</li>
      <li>I give it 4 stars only because it&#x27;s not the BEST concealer I&#x27;ve ever used in terms of coverage, but for my purposes it works well.</li>
      <li>I even tried to mix it with some lotion just to make it glide a bit better, but even then it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
      <li>This was okay.</li>
      <li>I was expecting something like the consistency of whipped cream, but this is more like peanut butter.</li>
      <li>The thing that I love most about it is that you can easily use it for touch ups throughout the day.</li>
      <li>After reading all of these great reviews, I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t like this concealer at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but mine didn&#x27;t have a sticker that says \\&quot;Maybelline Dream Mousse Concealer Corrector, Ivory Light</li>
      <li>really good concealer, good cover, BUT the jar its TOO small...</li>
      <li>This concealer is light and creamy and true to my skin color.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to set it with a powder, and it blends seamlessly into your skin but still has really nice coverage.</li>
      <li>This mousse is good when creamy, but tends to dry up in the case.</li>
      <li>I got the right color</li>
      <li>They also sent me the exact shade of concealer</li>
      <li>The only reason it isn&#x27;t great is because its too dry.</li>
      <li>Ivory Light matched my skin color just right, totally disguising the blemishes and brightening my eyes!</li>
      <li>This is a small size but good product</li>
      <li>i know that concealer cames in small sizes, but really good</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>, I really don&#x27;t see what the hype was since it immediately appeared pastey under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Its a fantastic concealer and covers my red spots.</li>
      <li>It worked a little better on my blemishes, but the coverage wasn&#x27;t anything to brag about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Got my 2 products in new, unopened, mint condition.</li>
      <li>Its a little cakey (this is an easy fix with a couple dabs of moisturizer mixed in while applying!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way too dry and  looks very cakey under my eyes.</li>
      <li>First off the amount is a lot less than what the picture will get you to believe</li>
      <li>Only complaint is if you don&#x27;t use it quick enough, sometimes it can clump up...</li>

    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this item because I&#x27;ve read such good things about it, but now that i&#x27;ve used it...it&#x27;s awful for me. It&#x27;s way too dry and  looks very cakey under my eyes. I even tried to mix it with some lotion just to make it glide a bit better, but even then it&#x27;s just ok. It still looks cakey no matter what though.</li>
    <li> Got my 2 products in new, unopened, mint condition. They also sent me the exact shade of concealer I ordered, unlike other users I&#x27;ve bought from. (Especially important since Maybelline discontinued my product!) **SO GLAD I ORDERED TWO!**  I will DEFINITELY be buying from this user again! &lt;3 Thank youuuu, Thank you! -Texas Tech Student! WRECK &#x27;EM!</li>
    <li> This concealer is great, it has great coverage and goes on smoothly, as I like. I apply it under my eyes and also on the red spots around my face (skin imperfections). Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I just got this concealer and i thought that it was amazing. One thing about the packaging is that it didn&#x27;t have the sticker on top of the lid. I don&#x27;t know why but mine didn&#x27;t have a sticker that says \\&quot;Maybelline Dream Mousse Concealer Corrector, Ivory Light 2-3.5 .11 oz (3 g)\\&quot; That was the only weird thing about it but besides that, this is an amazing concealer! It has a really creamy texture and a little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> really good concealer, good cover, BUT the jar its TOO small...i know that concealer cames in small sizes, but really good</li>
    <li> After reading all of these great reviews, I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t like this concealer at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it is definitely not a whipped consistency. It was dried out as soon as I got it! Like someone else says, it&#x27;s more like peanut butter than mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is NOT good for under-eye circles. It cakes up and seems to make the circles even more noticeable. It worked a little better on my blemishes, but the coverage wasn&#x27;t anything to brag about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it was hard to blend. I got the right color and it still looked caked on after blending it with both my fingers and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, didn&#x27;t like this product at all. I won&#x27;t even be using the rest of the container. Junk!</li>
    <li> Finally a breath of relief! This concealer is simply perfect. I had a huuuge problem with covering under eye dark circles and tried variety of brands, this thing does wonders. I&#x27;m not fair skinned and Ivory Light matched my skin color just right, totally disguising the blemishes and brightening my eyes! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a small size but good product and I would buy it in a larger size. Maybelline is a good brand and I always use it.</li>
    <li> This was okay. Its a fantastic concealer and covers my red spots. Its a heavy concealer so only to be used as a spot treatment coverage. BUT DONT BE FOOLED like I was, it only holds a very small amount. ost of your money goes to the thick glass container but it does last fairly long so it was alright.</li>
    <li> This mousse is good when creamy, but tends to dry up in the case. Add a little moisturizer on a brush and it goes on the skin smoother.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this concealer because I read a lot of great reviews on it.    I&#x27;m not impressed.    First off the amount is a lot less than what the picture will get you to believe, there&#x27;s not concealer in the colored cap, rather it&#x27;s in the glass part underneath. But I was okay with that, I just wanted to try it out.    When I put my finger in to feel it, surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t feel like what people said. I heard \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; among others. I was expecting something like the consistency of whipped cream, but this is more like peanut butter. This has a yellow undertone so I thought it would be great on my under-eye circles.     I was really disappointed that it went on really cake-y under my eyes, to the point where it highlighted the little bumps that I have in my blue-ish circles. I tried putting it on over moisturizer and still the same thing.    It goes on great over sparse acne around my cheeks, forehead, and chin. Do not put this on your nose to cover blackheads, because it catches on them and highlights them and it flakes.    I gave three stars because it works great and smoothly on everything but under eye circles. &#x27;tis a shame.</li>
    <li> To start, since it&#x27;s not a liquid, it won&#x27;t squirt out more than you want, and since it&#x27;s not a stick, nothing will break off and become misshapen. This concealer is light and creamy and true to my skin color. Very easy to blend over my face. I haven&#x27;t bought anything else for years!</li>
    <li> I bought this because the beauty community raved about it being great and discontinued and I bought a few, I really don&#x27;t see what the hype was since it immediately appeared pastey under my eyes. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I really love this concealer and I&#x27;m sad it&#x27;s been discontinued. The thing that I love most about it is that you can easily use it for touch ups throughout the day. You don&#x27;t need to set it with a powder, and it blends seamlessly into your skin but still has really nice coverage. I give it 4 stars only because it&#x27;s not the BEST concealer I&#x27;ve ever used in terms of coverage, but for my purposes it works well.</li>
    <li> I love this product- it is a great concealer / cover up. Only complaint is if you don&#x27;t use it quick enough, sometimes it can clump up...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law and she loves it. She uses it every day.</li>
    <li> Like any concealer it does the same job accept disappear the dark marks. It did arrive on time and it looked like it had less concealer than expected</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer that I&#x27;ve ever found and I am stockpiling it so that I will have it in the future. I can&#x27;t believe they discontinued it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product, it was very cakey and dry and didn&#x27;t go on smooth or natual-looking on skin.  Coverage of dark circles was very poor.  Not buying it again.</li>
    <li> The coverage is really great! Reapplication isn&#x27;t needed for quite sometime which is really great! The only reason it isn&#x27;t great is because its too dry. Its a little cakey (this is an easy fix with a couple dabs of moisturizer mixed in while applying!</li>
