      <li>it&#x27;s soothes, does not dry out, prevent acne and the best is..</li>
      <li>Ok so this is me yesterday at the store.</li>
      <li>Not a lot more to say.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s supposed to do more for scars than the face wash.</li>
      <li>and I am sure you will too.</li>
      <li>I had try more than 4 acne cleanser</li>
      <li>perfect face wash for a pre teen or teanager.</li>
      <li>I have combination (oily/dry) acne prone skin that holds red-marks for 10x longer than the actual pimple, and this is the best face wash I have ever used for my acne.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many scrubs and they never work.</li>
      <li>I still love Neutrogena products, just not this one.</li>
      <li>This product makes my skin feel too oily and it produced more severe outbreaks on my face.</li>
      <li>I jumped from Oxy Clinical to this product mostly because I ran out of Oxy Clinical.</li>
      <li>Maybe because my skins are resistant to most kinds of anti acne treatment....</li>
      <li>The scrub itself is very good to use on a daily basis.</li>

      <li>double package is good value.</li>
      <li>Leave it on, let it simmer, and you&#x27;ll see results quickly.</li>
      <li>Then as an adult I started using Proactiv with amazing results (at first).  </li>
      <li>Our next step was to purchase ProActive, but the price is a lot more than Neutrogena&#x27;s!</li>

      <li>and I still haven&#x27;t found one that works for me, so this stuff helps keep that at bay, FAR better than anything else</li>
      <li>As usual great service from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>They started to get rid of some pimples with use, and the small beads were great.</li>
      <li>I love make sure you use it everyday and</li>
      <li>Really well!</li>
      <li>Within the first use my skin felt better and my blemishes seemed smaller.  </li>
      <li>Love this product for daily cleansing.</li>
      <li>This product keeps my skin more clear than others and also resolved some of my old acne scars.</li>
      <li>It was working at first very well</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see much of a change, but after two weeks, my face was visibly clearer.</li>
      <li>Mine is dry skin hence the magic works... for people with acne</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, but it feels really soothing, most of all after a long day of being on stage for eight hours.</li>
      <li>being said, it smooths my skin and is great for dry or rough acne marks.</li>
      <li>I love that it keeps my skin relatively blemish free and doesn&#x27;t dry it out or cause redness.</li>
      <li>The whole family loves this.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use it to much it with make your skin peel..</li>

      <li>Seems to work real well.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling fresh and soft.</li>
      <li>This stuff has really improved my complexion.</li>
      <li>Hahaha.</li>
      <li>However I haven&#x27;t used make up for approximately two months now ever since I&#x27;ve used these products, and I am feeling more confident about myself</li>
      <li>If your a fan of the other Neutrogena acne cleansers/scrubs you will most likely enjoy this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for teenagers.  </li>
      <li>Clean and Clear was the only thing that would work for me.  </li>
      <li>it has really helped to fade my old acne scars!I</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve reduced my use to once every other day, and my skin is fine.</li>
      <li>Im actually using it right now XD</li>

    <li> The only thing that seems to be working for my teenagers. Our next step was to purchase ProActive, but the price is a lot more than Neutrogena&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s. Working wonders on my skin my acne is going away an my skin is smoother.</li>
    <li> I like it. It controls my breakout and makes my skin feels smoother. I would recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> perfect face wash for a pre teen or teanager. They will not have any breakout after using this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff has really improved my complexion. I have used Neutrogena face cleaning products for many years and they are all great products. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this because it is the best!</li>
    <li> One of the acne treatments that ive used and works.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works really well, it cleared up my acne in about two weeks and it slowly working on the scars. Sometimes new spots show up, but that&#x27;s always because I had to use bad make up for a show I was in. Otherwise it keeps the acne away just as well. I have very bad reactions to some kinds of makeup and I still haven&#x27;t found one that works for me, so this stuff helps keep that at bay, FAR better than anything else has. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the others do. It&#x27;s really slow on the scars, but I&#x27;m trying the cream treatment that goes with it and that&#x27;s supposed to do more for scars than the face wash. It also feels REALLY GOOD! It&#x27;s soothing to the skin. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, but it feels really soothing, most of all after a long day of being on stage for eight hours. I love it! Will use it forever.</li>
    <li> The whole family loves this. It leaves the skin clear and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  Have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Truly all in one. Helped to clear my acne and keep the pours from getting oily, not sure if its good to use it everyday though.</li>
    <li> It works, you just have to use it twice a day for a week. Im actually using it right now XD</li>
    <li> This works wonders! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> The scrub itself is very good to use on a daily basis. It has gentle microbeads and a warm tingling sensation when I use it. I also feel that my face is smoother after I use it. One thing that I do not really like about the product is that it does nothing for the scarring caused by acne. I have some light scars and some deep scars, neither one were helped by using this product. I gave this product 4 stars, because it does sufficiently clean my face and I feel it helps prevent future breakouts and it wasn&#x27;t too expensive either.</li>
    <li> I have been using 5 of neutrogenas products, daily before every shower, left it off for about ten minutes then rinse it off with cold water. I can see the difference it has made, my acne has been fading. I always used make up because of how my face looked I was too embarrassed to even step out of the house without at least a bit of cover up. However I haven&#x27;t used make up for approximately two months now ever since I&#x27;ve used these products, and I am feeling more confident about myself and I am sure you will too.</li>
    <li> Aggravated my skin, and I am by no means sensitive skinned. The &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; roughed up my face causing a break out. Not good acne control for me. Hopefully it works for other people. I still love Neutrogena products, just not this one.</li>
    <li> Effective for control of acne. Maintains clear the skin from pimples. Highly recommended for teenagers.  But shuold be used every day</li>
    <li> This product is very good. Simple as that.</li>
    <li> It does not work as great as expected. Maybe because my skins are resistant to most kinds of anti acne treatment.... But it is still a good daily scrub cleanser though.</li>
    <li> At first i was skeptical about using a regular drug store brand face wash since I have been used to buying pricey department store brands. Ive purchased this 2 pack of Neutrogena acne scrub around January and I really see a huge difference to my skin. It is now August and my face feels wonderful and smooth! The scrub is powerful enough to remove oils and pore clogging agents yet not abrasive enough to dry your skin. ANOTHER PLUS it has really helped to fade my old acne scars!I use a dime size every morning as part of my daily wash and it has lasted me for quite a few months. I am completely satisfied with this product and will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> this product works so well! it actually got rid of a few pimples in 2 - 3 days. and it also makes my skin way less oily and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for nearly a month now, I wanted to review it after one day of use because of the immediate results I saw but from past experiences with other products I decided to wait a month.  And wow what a difference a month made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered from acne since I was about 14 years old and I have tried EVERYTHING.  And when I say everything I literally mean everything.  If it&#x27;s supposed to help acne in any way I will try it.  When I was a teen (I am in my 30s now) Clean and Clear was the only thing that would work for me.  I had tried Neutrogena and hated it.  I thought it left my skin oily.  Then as an adult I started using Proactiv with amazing results (at first).  After about a year of use and flawless skin my face started turning red, itching and burning.  I decided to stop using the product twice a day and go to once a day.  When I dropped the frequency my face broke out the worst that it ever had.  I was 26 at the time and had acne like a teenage boy (and I am a female).  Friends and family were always asking me what was wrong with my face.  It was that bad  I tried to start using Proactiv twice a day again but it just got worse and worse til I had to stop all together.  I still have scars from that (I&#x27;m 33 now).  Since then I have tried numerous products and eventually I wasn&#x27;t breaking out as bad but still enough to make me not want to go out in public some days.  Then I was looking online at products on Amazon for acne and saw this one.  I knew I didn&#x27;t like Neutrogena in the past but thought I would try it again.  And WOW!  Within the first use my skin felt better and my blemishes seemed smaller.  My husband noticed within a few days that my skin was clearing up.  Acne scars that I have had since using Proactiv started disappearing.  My face looks bright and with a glow.  I am so thrilled with this!  I still get occasional break outs but now they are nowhere near as bad as in the past and they clear up so fast.  And when I say occasional I mean at most 3 a month when before it was 4 or 5 a week.  I have very sensitive skin and cannot wear foundation or even most lotions on my face, so to be able to find something that makes my skin clear is a miracle!  I am using this product combined with Neutrogena Clear Pore astringent and Aveeno Clear Complexion Moisturizer.  It&#x27;s wonderful, wonderful!  I cannot rave enough about how well this product works.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!ay occasional I mean at most 3 a month when before it was 4 or 5 a week.

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a myriad of products and methods to cure my acne. I started having acne when I was 15, I&#x27;m now in my mid-twenties and acne likes to linger as a reminder of how bad it was in high school.&lt;br /&gt;I began using this product back in October of last year, and I&#x27;m pleased to say it&#x27;s the first product that has actually worked that doesn&#x27;t require me to apply it 5 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this once in the morning when I shower, and again at night before bed. It smells great, and leaves your skin feeling smooth, clean, and a bit tingly. The cream contains a small amount of exfoliating sand, which helps to open your pores and pull excess dirt, oil, and dead skin from your face. Within a week of use, my acne had cleared. Now I very rarely encounter a rogue zit, and I haven&#x27;t had a serious breakout since I began using this.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that it comes in this tiny bottle that usually runs out within two weeks, so this is a $20/mo expense, but well worth it. I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and family and they&#x27;ve been just as pleased.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re an acne sufferer, the reviews here on Amazon should be more than enough incentive to give it a shot - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> As usual great service from Amazon.  Neutrgena is a nice product</li>
    <li> Well I am in my early 30&#x27;s, don&#x27;t have a lot of acne but I do have some on my forehead and chin. I have used this entire tube and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I use this on my back and it works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing product. Leaves skin ultra soft , gives it a nice luminosity and doesnt cause dryness at all . It feels like a have baby skin now and my post acne scars seems to fade little by little</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for two days, and I can already say that as soon as you use it, your skin feels SMOOTH. I had a really bad breakout this past week so I went to CVS and bought this. As soon as I used it, my skin felt noticibly smoother. Two days later my skin already seems to be clearing up. I will write another review in a few months.</li>
    <li> It got rid of almost all my acne. I also used their facial cleansing wipes with the grapefruit scent.Don&#x27;t use it to much it with make your skin peel..</li>
    <li> I have oily skin. I jumped from Oxy Clinical to this product mostly because I ran out of Oxy Clinical. This product makes my skin feel too oily and it produced more severe outbreaks on my face. I was on this product for 3 weeks when I decided to stop using it.</li>
    <li> My acne acts up weekly in different spots, and I&#x27;ve used this product multiple times to counteract my problems.  The key to this working, in my opinion, is to leave it on for a minimum of one hour.  Don&#x27;t just put it on your face and wash it off immediately.  Leave it on, let it simmer, and you&#x27;ll see results quickly.</li>
    <li> Amazing product with amazing results</li>
    <li> Have recently been using this and wish it came in a larger bottle because it goes too fast! I also am fond of it and think it is a good product. If your a fan of the other Neutrogena acne cleansers/scrubs you will most likely enjoy this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it smooths my skin and is great for dry or rough acne marks. It did not dry me out horribly either like most acne products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of constantly using a cleanser/scrub for acne I like to alternate between one like this, a more moisturizing/sensitive skin cleanser, or olive oil soap just to keep my skin from eventually becoming dry or dull.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff when I start to break out and it works like a charm within a couple of days. It&#x27;s incredibly simple. Not a lot more to say.</li>
    <li> Ok so this is me yesterday at the store. Urgggg acne on my chin,,,what should I do? I&#x27;ve tried so many scrubs and they never work. Oh well I&#x27;ll give it one last try so I picked up this product.&lt;br /&gt;Now I use 2 different acne scar faders and they don&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up this morning to see that both of the pimples I have totally went down in size and swelling ...and I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My scars look faded after using it once. I must be imagining this. Hahaha. Get it !!</li>
    <li> For me... This product was amazing ! The right side of my face has been broken out for years. I am glad to share with you, that this stuff cleared it up in just a couple of days! I hope it works as well for you!</li>
    <li> I began to see a difference in my skin, however, with bi-daily use, it dried my skin out.  I&#x27;ve reduced my use to once every other day, and my skin is fine.</li>
    <li> Well.  I am one of those who&#x27;s had constant acne problem since almost 10 years. This facewash is something .. not only it smoothes your skin, it definitely prevents acnes. I have been using this since a week now and didn&#x27;t experience a single n acne.. I have not experienced this kind of an immediate effect with any of my previous dermatologists recommended facewashes... my skin reacts instant if the product is not good but this one product has it all.. it&#x27;s soothes, does not dry out, prevent acne and the best is.. it adds glow to your skin... this is definitely one of the most amazing products. Not sure if this would suit an oily skin as this facewash has ingredients which prevent over drying. Mine is dry skin hence the magic works... for people with acne this is a sure shot worth trying. You never know this may just beyond one of your have to have products.</li>
    <li> They started to get rid of some pimples with use, and the small beads were great. However, as with all other face washes, they are inconvenient. After 2 bottles, they were 1/2 gone, not bad, but not the best. i recommend pads that can be used without the lathering and rinsing.</li>
    <li> I use this product to get rid of minor blemishes from sweat and such. I have used all types of different products to get rid of /acne/blemishes, but this is the one that works and keeps them from returning.</li>
    <li> It was working at first very well but I forgot to use it one day and I broke out so nasty under my chin and I was disappointed-,-</li>
    <li> Best Product for acne  !!!! you must try</li>
    <li> I had been using Proactiv for awhile, about 2 years, until I left for college and became too troublesome to try and receive the packages from my step mother. While in browsing in Walmart, searching for a Proactiv replacement, and came across this product. I bought the daily scrub, the toner, and the lotion. At first I didn&#x27;t see much of a change, but after two weeks, my face was visibly clearer. I use it twice a day, sometimes three if it&#x27;s hot outside and my face is feeling oily, and this Neutrogena trio is more effective than Proactiv ever was for me. If I keep up with it daily, I won&#x27;t see any blemishes. But when I was using Proactiv, I would get the occasional blemish regardless of whether or not I was using it regularly. Although the product does claim that it fades acne as well as treats and prevents it, I can not speak for its effectiveness as far as fading post acne marks, because I have been using a leftover container of Proactiv&#x27;s \\&quot;dark spot corrector\\&quot; along with this product line. Below I have listed the Neutrogena toner &amp; Lotion that I use in combination with this daily scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 in 1 Toner:[[ASIN:B003156NL6 Neutrogena Rapid Clear 2-in-1 Fight and Fade Toner, 8 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;Acne Defense Lotion: [[ASIN:B00BE3N5XQ Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion 1.7 fl oz (50 ml)]]</li>
    <li> I am on to my third tube and it helps. Haven&#x27;t had any major breakouts since using this product. However, it does not get rid of past signs of acne, and it is not completely acne proof either.</li>
    <li> It works great cleared my face up and it work 10 times better then the stuff that the dertogist gave me it&#x27;s legit and it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out I love make sure you use it everyday and u should start seeing results with in 2 to 3 weeks great stuff right here and it also smells good and feels good on the face I can&#x27;t stop talking about it lol but this it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I have combination (oily/dry) acne prone skin that holds red-marks for 10x longer than the actual pimple, and this is the best face wash I have ever used for my acne. A lot of other face washes either make my acne worse (by constantly pulling breakouts to the surface), or hardly make a difference. This one helps with everything I need-- blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, and scarring-- without overdrying. It makes my skin glow!</li>
    <li> This works. Really well! I love that it keeps my skin relatively blemish free and doesn&#x27;t dry it out or cause redness.</li>
    <li> This product i have already used before, and it&#x27;s wondeful to take off acne. I recommend it, and it&#x27;s very cheap, in my case, in Venezuela, we don&#x27;t find this label anymore, so it&#x27;s a good option get it by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use it two times a day in the summer but only need to use it once in the winter. It&#x27;s great. Keeps my acne to a minimum.</li>
    <li> Love this product for daily cleansing. Thoroughly cleans without irritating or drying skin. Leaves skin feeling fresh and soft. double package is good value.</li>
    <li> Was recommended this by the aesthetician performing my recent facial. I put it on before washing my hair and leave it on about 8-10 minutes and skin comes out feeling so incredibly soft after the shower. Using it 2-3x per week has keep my skin clear and reduced my blackheads after about 3 months of use.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my skin more clear than others and also resolved some of my old acne scars. I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> Seems to work real well.</li>
    <li> I had try more than 4 acne cleanser but they all didn&#x27;t work but this one worked after 2 months of using. Really good product</li>
