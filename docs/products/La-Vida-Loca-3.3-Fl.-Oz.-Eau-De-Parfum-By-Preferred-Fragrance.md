<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I strongly think this was advertised as viva la juicy, but when i got my confirmation email it said vida loca... Hirrible smells cheap .. Do nkt buy ...i dont even know why Amazon allows knock offs...</li>
    <li> LOVE this perfume. Didn&#x27;t get it from Amazon but from Cato&#x27;s and the smell is awesome. It is kind of strong so if your allergies are sensitive it&#x27;ll make you sneeze(I&#x27;ve sneezed a few times).</li>
    <li> I did not buy this perfume hoping it smelled like Viva La Juicy.Honestly, I found it too strong and sweet for my taste.This one on the other hand is lighter and has a great appeal to it the other did not. I love this perfume for what it is.It smells great in its own Oriental type of way to me.</li>
    <li> I got my bottle of La Vida Loca at my Beall&#x27;s outlet store. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it was from an outlet store or some other reason, but it smelled nothing like Viva La Juicy. I ended up taking it back that night. The packaging is cute, but I couldn&#x27;t justify keeping it. Maybe i&#x27;ll try buying it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Parfum arrived extremely fast:&#x27;) I can&#x27;t live without my Juicy! One of my favs \\&quot;Viva La Juicy\\&quot; I honestly don&#x27;t like the immitation:( It doesn&#x27;t smell much like my Juicy, It goes on strong &amp; actually has me sneezing/head starting to bother me:( I am not sensitive to the real juicy..I always have a bottle on hand and a back up..I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff..If you&#x27;ve never smelled the real parfum then it may be an okay scent but i&#x27;m just going to stick with the real Juicy!!!</li>
    <li> Doesnt smell good i think its fake! It smells like cheap alcohol perfume. Wouldnt recommend unfortunately although the price is what drew me in cause i thought it may be real and how bad could it be right? Not worth $5 bucks</li>
    <li> Love this off brand they did a great job !</li>
    <li> This does smell like the real thing....just not as strong and doesn&#x27;t last very long. But for the price, you could apply it more often. Smells great and isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Overall, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes of it being a good knock off of viva la juicy.. it smells very close to the real thing however I feel that it wears off fairly quickly but all in all im happy with the purchase..</li>
    <li> Great Product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I did not realize this was impersonation cologne.  The packaging was so c lose to the real viva la juicy.  Very misleading!  To top it off it was nothing close to the real thing.  I wouldn&#x27;t even regift it.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this from eBay before I knew it&#x27;s available in stores &amp; on Amazon (&amp; I actually paid more on eBay than it costs on Amazon!). I kept getting outbid on the real Juicy Couture &#x27;Viva La Juicy&#x27; that&#x27;s so popular right now. So I read that this knockoff is a great dupe &amp; it really is. Smells lovely, soft &amp; light, yet warm &amp; caramelly, just like the real thing. Great savings for the scent! Big bottle (3.3oz) lasts a long time &amp; looks pretty on the dresser.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells just absolutely lovely!! It has a lite sweet/floral to it. the bottle is just so cute, I put it on my dresser so it could stand out lol. I spray it everywhere! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> i was introduced to this fragrance through a friend, and i absolutely love it. For the record, it doesn&#x27;t smell like baby powder, it has a nice clean fresh scent to it. If your looking to purchase something that smells good, and is inexpensive Check this fragrance out! worth the buy!</li>
    <li> So I thought this was actually the real juicy cloture spray . &amp; it wasn&#x27;t ! The smell didn&#x27;t really stick ! However the box design &amp; the perfume design were cute.</li>
    <li> Scent does not last more than ten minutes. What a huge disappointment! I wish samples were available for this prior to purchasing!</li>
    <li> i  love it it is light want buy real perfume  it good for pricebuy and wear everyday cheap price for money clean</li>
    <li> I love the scent so much! I recommend it to everyone. :)&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend really likes the smell of it too!</li>
    <li> I was kind of scared to order this since all of the negative reviews but I decided to try it. When it came, the box was kind of smashed but the product itself was in a good condition. I compared it to my Viva La Juicy perfume and  they smelled almost exactly the same!! I am very pleased tat I got this product and I would definetly re-perchase it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the product, it smelled similar to Viva La Juicy after the the smell wore off some what but when 1st praying is very strong and smelled like alcohol. My daughter said it smelled like old ladies purfume. I was extremely disapponted because I had purchased the same exact thing in a smaller bottle from a dollar store for my daughter for Christmas and I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the Viva La Juicy and the cheap stuff I bought from the dollar store, it was also called La Vida Loca, but completely different from the La Vida Loca I purchased on line. Anyway I was told maybe it was a bad batch or maybe their are different manufacturers of the same parfum...maybe but I don&#x27;t know! So now I will never again waste my money on this cheap imitation parfum again.&lt;br /&gt;The retailer SCARLETTE DIOR did everything possible to make me 110% satisfied, I would purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I really llove this smell I have some many asking me what do I have on. I really love this smell it&#x27;s great...</li>
    <li> This is beyond my favorite perfume! Found it for really cheap on here, and decided to order it! Amazing price, and it shipped super fast! Love it! Would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants a great smelling perfume!</li>
    <li> It smells really great and was not extremely expensive. Seller shipped fast.  It was actually the newer  2.7 oz , because 3.3 oz was the older packaging .</li>
    <li> It kinda has this soapy, citrus feel to it and the bottle is cute. I guess the longevity was okay and the smell is not too overbearing. It was decent.</li>
    <li> Last year I was given a gift set that was La Vida Loca, the perfume was amazing. So good that I wanted to get another bottle to make it my main scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this as product here as a gift and it doesn&#x27;t smell like the other La Vida Loca perfume. It&#x27;s similar but there&#x27;s something in there that&#x27;s to flowery or something. It&#x27;s over powering. I smelt both at the same time and I could probably jsut ay it&#x27;s a different scent all together. Not one I&#x27;m very fond of. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the inconsistency. I even compared labels and bottles. It&#x27;s the same product.</li>
    <li> It dosnt smell anything like viva la juicy. It stinks and smells like an old lady. Don&#x27;t buy this! Stinky!!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the scent.  I love, love the bottle. I purchased this for my oldest granddaughter for Christmas and I am sure she will love it. The price was great and I received it in a very short time. I am very picky when it comes to parfum and this one is a winner. Great costumer service!</li>
    <li> This was not the perfume as advertised. It smelled like bad hair spray. Very disappointed. Waste of money. Do not buy!!</li>
    <li> this is just nasty! I ordered  this before (different seller, same brand) and this smelt nothing like the bottle i got before! this smelt like something your grandma or 74 year old teacher would wear, its a powdery-floral scent unlike the bottle i received before which smelt warm and sweet- almost like caramel but yet not over bearing. Listen too the other bad reviews and don&#x27;t buy this. I think they put the wrong perfume in the bottles from this seller. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SEND ME THIS PERFUMELA VIDA LOCA ..I&#x27;M APPRECIATE...I&#x27;LL ODER MORE OF THE PERFUME PERFUME ...SINCERLY..SOGNO</li>
    <li> So when I got this item I was like wow this is a nice and big bottle so I tried it and I love it so u know u can&#x27;t go wrong with purshasing this product so it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for someone else, so I don&#x27;t know until after Christmas if the gift will be liked.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T WORTH THE MONEY &amp; NOT AN GOOD GIFT FOR SOMEONES ,ITS NOT THE REAL BRAND !,I WAS SO UP SET WHEN I BOUGHT IT FOR SOMEONE CHRISTMAS GIFT AND ITS NOT EVEN 3.3OZ ITS 2.7OZ THATS VERY SMALL !</li>
    <li> This perfume smells okay, not very similar to the original, and wears off very quickly. Not happy with this product....I&#x27;ll just give it to my neice or something.</li>
    <li> It smells really good.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!  Always get a lot of compliments  and asked what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing.  Great price too!  I bought this for a friend of mine and after it was all gone she asked me where I bought it so she could get more!</li>
    <li> For this product, i would definitely say buy the real thing. smells a bit like baby powder, and doesn&#x27;t last long. good buy at current price- but defintely spring for the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Not at all like the real thing.</li>
    <li> I love the viva la juicy perfume so when i saw this i definitely wanted to try it, especially for only 8 bucks. it may not be the exact thing or last half as long as viva la juicy, but it does smell delicious while it does last. it definitely keeps me from going through my viva la juicy in a month like i normally do.&#x3D;) love love love.</li>
    <li> smells so bad not like the mini bottle i had that smelled amazing</li>
    <li> Been wearing this perfume I really love it and I did it realize how big the bottle was but it will last me a while and it stays on a long time it smells so good iam not just saying this they have this at Kohls so I have smelled this before this was a great buy and a great size bottle for my money the seller was fast this is my other favorite perfume know and the bottle is pretty to you get your moneys worth for get designers perfume this is just as good and can afford. Seller did a wonderful job packaging it came in the mail as in the picture awesome perfume another winner for me that&#x27;s why I keep coming back to amazon I get my moneys worth on here.</li>
    <li> This smells really good to me, and I enjoy it. It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Viva La Juicy, but I actually like it better! I had my friend smell it who used to use VLJ as her signature scent, and she said it smelled nothing like it. VLJ is way too caramelly and sickly sweet. This one holds VLJ&#x27;s lovely fruity topnotes through it&#x27;s whole lifespan. However, it doesn&#x27;t last and you must keep reapplying. :(</li>
    <li> Smelled straight awful. Not at all the real thing.</li>
    <li> La vida Loca light scent I really like at only hate about is does not last long</li>
    <li> I actually have a mini bottle of la vida loca and this perfume is not la vida loca. and it smells like crap. I deeply considered cleaning out my kitty litter box and sending the clumps to the seller. Maybe that&#x27;s irrational but basically what they did to me.</li>
    <li> mentioned weight was not delivered to me.perfume is not at all long lasting.i m very disappointed.i was expecting alot that&#x27;s why I ordered two bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> I ordered on the 29th of jan which was suppose to be a 3.3 fl oz and recieved the 2nd of Feb a 2.7 fl oz. I recieved the wrong size but just purchased to see the difference in scent. Its not the same scent but it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I know that it must be kind scary to buy these type of perfumes, but let&#x27;s be honest when they do a right product I really don&#x27;t care for the name but for what my friend will be smelling like. I mean you wear this perfume but most people would love it or the way it does smell, but they really don&#x27;t know if is the real deal or not, so this is great. I am going for what I got, not for what is in the stores. also it was fast delivery...</li>
    <li> the smell is ok i have an impression body spray of the real perfume aswell and it smells better then this. i just wish it was a bit sweeter like the body spray i have. the bottle was cute. my grama said it was a cute bottle to. i wouldnt recommend this to anyone though. its good as an air freshener. i spray it around my room. the scent doesnt last long either. oh well. i had better impressions.</li>
    <li> is a good perfume and I really liked the people that he loved Give the gift I recommend it to my family and friends</li>
    <li> not quite the same as the original scent</li>
    <li> THE BOTTLE IS CUTE (the lil pink bow adds a lil something to it) AND IT WAS SHIPPED BY THE SUPPLIER AT THE THE INDICATED; ONLY DOWN FALL FOR ME IS THAT IS DOES NOT SMELL AS GOOD AS THE REAL THING, WHICH IS, &amp;#34;VIVA LA JUICY&amp;#34;. IT WILL MAKE A NICE GIFT FOR A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER THOUGH.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent.. Showed it is 3.3 fl.oz and the one I received was 2.7oz . I will NOT buy it again</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible and cheap.  The bottle is cute.  Threw it away, not worth sending back.  Don&#x27;t waste your time purchasing it.</li>
    <li> DISGUSTING!!!&lt;br /&gt;This used to be my absolute favorite perfume in the world, had gone through 3 bottles bought this one and IT&#x27;S NASTY!!! They changed the formula - Smells like OLD LADY!!!  SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  trouble getting refund because it is not through Amazon</li>
    <li> Perfume is a very personal choice. I brought this trying to save a few bucks as the Viva La Juicy is overpriced. Ironically this smells like Juicy Couture for Women which has the following notes: watermelon, mandarin, pink passion fruit, green leaves, water hyacinth and marigold flowers,tuberose, lily, and wild rose,caramels, powdery vanilla, creme brulee, patchouli and woods. It&#x27;s funny because La Vida Loca was supposed to be an Impression of Viva La Juicy which has the following notes: wild berries,juicy mandarin, floral blend of honeysuckle, gardenia and jasmine,  amber, caramel, vanilla, sandalwood and pralines. La Vida was very fruity and I definitely picked up a watermelon and tuberose smell. When I tested out Viva La Juicy it was very warm. The caramel, vanilla and praline revealed themselves immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La Vida Loca smelled terrible on me, much like the Juicy Couture&#x27;s Courture for Women. I almost wondered if they were doing an impression of that one instead of Viva La Juicy. I definitely plan on buying the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Viva.</li>
    <li> The bottle was broke. I am very upset. I know its a good deal, but money is money, and i paid for something that i cant even use because of how the packaging was.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere near the real thing. A waste of money. I regret buying this item. Smells closer to cat pee than it does to viva la juicy. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my little sister after smelling the original... which is phenominal by the way. But this stuff was just awful. The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant at all. I felt to bad giving it to her. but the packaging is pretty. The stuff doesn&#x27;t last forever but it&#x27;s soooo overpowering, just one spray is overpowering.. and stinky.</li>
    <li> I ordered the fragrance LA VIDA LOCA , an imitation of VIVA LA JUICY. I can&#x27;t believe how much they smell alike! I think I may even like the imitation better. :) I am also surprised at how long the fragrance lasted on me. It&#x27;s a beautiful soft, sweet, floral powdery smell, nice! I received the product in a timely manner as well. The only sad thing is I went to order this from OEM RUN again, only 2 weeks later and they don&#x27;t carry it anymore! I was so surprised! and so disappointed. I did find other sellers who have it for sale but I only trust OEM RUN. I hope they consider selling it again, I may have to buy a dozen! I liked it that much. I have a terrible time finding a fragrance that I truly like or mixes well with my chemistry and the LA VIDA LOCA perfect! Please OEM RUN bring it back to your web site!</li>
    <li> This smells nothing like Viva La Juicy, but smells identical to Juicy Couture By Juicy Couture. I love Viva La Juicy and already have gone through 4 bottles of it. I was just looking for a cheaper alternative but, this is a completely different scent.. there are no similarities at all. The scent does however smell like another Juicy Couture perfume, which is called Juicy Couture by Juicy Couture. I have that perfume as well, and they smell the same. So if you are hoping that it smells like Viva La Juicy, then I don&#x27;t recommend this perfume. But, if you want a perfume that smells like Juicy Couture by Juicy Couture insteed, then I would give this a try!</li>
    <li> They changed the scent of the perfume....Now I don&#x27;t like it on me but Great Christmas gifts...</li>
    <li> Others have said that this smelled like alcohol! It has a very strong odor when you first put it on, but if you let it set a minute it smells very nice! Not exactly like Viva la Juicy but really close! It lasts about 3 hours or so. Very good product, it was cheap, good quality, and FREE shipping, it even got here a day early.</li>
    <li> La Vida Loca is a great Parfum! Smells good and lasts about 2 hours.  I buyed it at BigLots for $3.50 and it was a great buy. Haven&#x27;t u tryed the other ones like these? I found out that the ones that u get from Macy&#x27;s or anywere else is to much money if u want to buy it...  Go for it and see how it lasts for u and let me know!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance,  and have had many complaints.  Thank You</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Not only is it very similar to to the real thing, but the lasting power is decent and the bottle is actually appealing to look at. I don&#x27;t see myself buying Viva La Juicy as long as this is being sold.</li>
    <li> This scent is very warm smelling and will bring many compliments. Every time I wear it atleast one person will tell me how nice I smell. I am a perfume collector so I usually combine this scent with a more flowery scent and I will spray this scent on my wrist and then I will spray the more flowery spray on my clothes. I highly reccommend this lovely scent.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in hopes of getting a cheeper, more affordable version of viva la juicy.&lt;br /&gt;THis perfume smells good...but only up close. I have found that you have actually PUT.&lt;br /&gt;YOUR FACE UP TO IT, to actually smell it. The bottle is cute...but that&#x27;s about it. The very&lt;br /&gt;First day I got it ( after just normal handleing)  the little bow fell off the glue. I had to&lt;br /&gt;actually spray the perfume two or three times to make sure that the nasty alcohol smell&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t get on me. It also fades after like twenty minuets. I had no problem with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I was only upset about the peruke formula. I also noticed that there were little white things&lt;br /&gt;in the bottom floating around..I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal..but it had the gross look o&lt;br /&gt;balkwash floating Ianthe bottom. Shipping was fast..no problem with packaging....but I would not&lt;br /&gt;reccomend this perfume.</li>
    <li> the smell doesnt stay but a few minutes so not happy with it. Its not you its the place that makes it.</li>
    <li> The fragrance has a light sweetness without a touch of something that seems almost husky. I really, really like it.</li>
    <li> This product was advertised as the Viva va jiuicy by Juicy. This is a knock off fragrance. Had I noticed that I would NOT have ordered this!</li>
    <li> This review is for the product itself, not the seller. This stuff makes me gag every time I smell it. It is also so strong. The few times I have worn it, I end up have a terrible head ache and feel nauseous. This also smells absolutely nothing like the real Viva La Juicy. I have gone through two bottles and I have one right now. Nothing alike. I have found another impression for it and they smell almost identical. Even though it&#x27;s not as cheap as this, it&#x27;s worth it. Even though this is about $3.50 depending on where you buy it, you still lose a little because I have no use for this.</li>
    <li> i bought this perfume because viva la juicy is my favorite perfume but its so expensive that i hate to wear it!&lt;br /&gt;i got this as an everyday perfume so i could use my juicy one just on special occasions. This is definitely not the same scent! this is very soft, floral, mature feminine, i think it has jasmine undertones. viva la juicy is sweet, vanilla, carmel- its very warm and fall like. this smells good, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but its a floral scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep this perfume because the lasting power is AMAZING! it stays on better than some of my designer perfumes!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i like the scent on this perfume but if you&#x27;re looking for a dupe of viva la juicy, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. or maybe not from this particular seller.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed.  Going to return this product.  Does not smell like Viva La Juicy AT ALL.  Smells strong and very jasmine like.  It is actually more similar to the \\&quot;juicy\\&quot; by juicy couture perfume.</li>
    <li> Smells NOTHING like viva la juicy, in ANY way possible. I was very disappointed with this purchase. It smelled so heavy and gross. It was very bad. Sometimes even if the impression doesn&#x27;t really smell like the real thing, it at least still kinda smells good. This does not lol.</li>
