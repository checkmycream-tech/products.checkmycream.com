    <li> These are great Essential Oil bottle top stickers. Very inexpensive &amp; you have the ability to write your own blend mix. They fit on top of 5ml,15ml &amp; roll-on EO round bottle tops. I use an extra fine sharpie permanent marker to write on stickers ( make sure tops are clean so they stick &amp; won&#x27;t smear). There&#x27;s not a lot of room to write long oil names so I abbreviate or use first letters of oils.

As well, they are a great value for the money. I will definitely be ordering more of these when I need them.</li>
    <li> Should have read the description better.  These smaller than my other labels and are too small to write the name of the oils on. Will not be reordering.</li>
    <li> Right size to mark bottles of oil. Stick really well. Shipped fast in good shape.</li>
    <li> product was as described</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for the tops of roller bottles!</li>
    <li> Cheap. Came in the mail all crumbled up and doesn&#x27;t even stick to the bottles. They keep peeling off. Not worth $6. Maybe $1.</li>
    <li> Works perfect on my essential oils bottles and helps to keep the in order.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, perfect round labels for my essential oil bottles</li>

    <li> These work perfectly with my smaller bottles that I have.</li>
    <li> Bought these labels because I have essential oils in a box just for the oils. The problem I have is that I have to take each bottle out of the box to see what the name is on the bottle. These lifesaver tabs make it easy to just open the box and read the label and grab the bottle I want. It saves me a lot of time..Great idea.</li>
    <li> These blank labels are perfect for my sample bottles of essential oils!!😊😊😊</li>

    <li> Fast shipping, works well for essential oil bottles</li>
    <li> Love the little stckers.</li>
    <li> These stickers are perfect!! I can see what is what in my &#x27;oil box&#x27; now without lifting up each bottle! They stick very well on the smooth topped oils and on the ones with raised markings on the tops, I just put a dab of Elmers and they work fine.</li>
