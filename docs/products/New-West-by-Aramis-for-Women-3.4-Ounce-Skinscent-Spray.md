<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This perfume takes me back to my youth, fresh and light.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Aramis/New West since approx. 1991 or so. My love affair with it all started when I was at a Halloween party and smelled it on another girl. I asked what it was and ever since then, I was hooked.  Unfortunately, they removed it from merchants on the East Coast so before computers became popular, I was so desperate that I started ordering it from its manufacturer, Aramis.  Now, though, I&#x27;m able to conveniently order it online.  It&#x27;s so fresh and crisp smelling.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it over the yrs. from family and friends.  Yep, I love New West--always have and always will!</li>
    <li> Hard to find. This purchase makes my wife very happy. Great deal. I will purchase again. They discontinued this scent in 1995.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this perfume, but I was sceptical about purchasing it because there have been reports of fakes. I was so happy when I received my package. it was just the scent I wanted and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It came in only a couple of days also. I totally reccoment this to all. Great product.</li>
    <li> My sister loves this perfume and has not been able to find it in stores. It was her birthday and I took the chance to see if Amazon had it and they did. I sent it and she said she didn&#x27;t need to open anything else, this was her favorite gift. Thanks so much for making me make my sister happy.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all with Amazon.com!  I purchased perfume on here and I get sick from the smell!  They say I can&#x27;t return it cuz it is a flammable liquid!  But they sent it too me!  This perfume doesn&#x27;t even smell like it used to at all.</li>
    <li> New West by Aramis has been a favorite of mine since the &#x27;80&#x27;s. I was so happy to find it offered on Amazon. I hear that Aramis has discontinued its production.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve worn this scent before you know how wonderful it WAS. Over time perfume breaks down and no longer smells the same and unfortunately it has finally happened to New West. I knew it was going to happen sooner or later.... :(</li>
    <li> WOW, SO THIS WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENTS, SO IMAGINE HOW EXCITED I WAS TO FIND IT AND ORDER IT. WHEN IT ARRIVED I RIPPED OPEN THE PACKAGE AND BEGAN SPRAYING...I WAS IN THE SHOWER SHORTLY AFTER. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT SEXY SCENT THAT I REMEMBERED AND WORE PROUDLY. IT&#x27;S GONE! I CAN&#x27;T EXPLAIN IT. IT WAS FAMILIAR, BUT WAS MISSING THE UMPH! IF THERE IS A SPORT VERSION OF NEW WEST, IT MAY BE THE ONE I REMEMBER, BUT I DONT WANT TO PAY AGAIN TO FIND OUT. SERVICE AND PROMPTNESS AND PRICE WERE GOOD. I JUST DO NOT REMEMBER THIS FRAGRANCE BEING LIKE THIS.</li>
    <li> Such a great perfume making dreams of sea side all around you and make you happy even when the weather is cold and grey...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spirit of on the west side: all California in a perfume. Wind,sea waves, a bottle manufacture with Old the New form and a case with the colors shocks: lifestyle of a certain American youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the experts, it is the first true marine perfume, that which dared to surprise us by his extremely generous iodized note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It opened up the way for the many female ones and masculines which took again the use of the marine or watery notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massive first job in a perfume of a marine accent, ozonic, the calone. It is accompanied here by watery fruits, watermelon and pasteque, and of a little note \\&quot;oyster\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green notes of galbanum, of hyacinth, lilies and of mint amplify marine freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In bottom, the modernity of the marine note continues, associated with wooded with cedar and musk.&lt;br /&gt; Very innovating, this formula at the beginning had been imagined for a masculine before being adapted and developed for female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find it on fragranceX.com and parfumemporium.fr and others web places at normal prices around 50 Euros or USD !</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume for my wife this Christmas. She loves it. It was priced 40% less than last year (I loved that).</li>
    <li> I used to wear New West back in my school days and loved it then and still love it now....</li>
    <li> I have been wearing New West for around 15 years, I love the smell.  I have not been without a bottle in all these years.  Try it you will love it</li>
    <li> Too happy to find the wonderful smell I used to wear back in the 90&#x27;s !&lt;br /&gt;Hope Aramis will re-issue the body lotion and the desert nectar which were a wonder.&lt;br /&gt;New West is really the Spirit of the Southwest !</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years, couldn&#x27;t find in the store and Amazon having it was a god sent.  Tried different ones but this is my all time favorite, and my family says don&#x27;t switch because they like it so much.</li>
    <li> This is my summer go to scent.  It&#x27;s a very clean smell with hiits of floral and fruit notes. It is not overpowering and does not arrive in the room before you do.  Great lasting power.</li>
    <li> this smells nothing like the new west I remember from the 90&#x27;s. When I recieved this fragrance it was really strong and smelt more of a men&#x27;s cologne. Was really disappointed since this was my x-mas gift for myself then come to find out I can&#x27;t exchange it cause of amazon&#x27;s rules. Needless to say, I gave it away! :(</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance. It&#x27;s a fresh scent and everyone that comes within my range says &amp;#34;what are you wearing, It smells so clean and fresh.&amp;#34;  They have stopped making it and I&#x27;m very upset.  Why do they always discontinue wonderful fresh scents and keep making the Sicky Sweet and overpowering Flower scents? If you know where to find more New West for Women let me know. Only one was available.  This was a wonderful SCENT. Men love it.</li>
    <li> A tantalizing scent. I love it, my wife loves it. But hard to get. Time for Aramis to start production again!</li>
    <li> The shipping of this product was very timely; however, I do not believe that the scent is the same perfume.  I compared the smell, as well as the consistency, of the product I received to the product I have, and they were not the same.  It may be that the manufacturer changed the ingredients, but the difference was staggering.  The scent I have known and enjoyed for years, smells awful from whatever I received.</li>
    <li> Best Scent EVER Made! This is My Signature SCENT! When one of my Dearest Friends passed suddenly, his 2 Beautiful girls greeted me at the house. I had not seen them for 2 years. Despite their grief, as they Hugged me, they said, Wow! You Smell the Same &amp;amp; how they Missed that Smell at their place &amp;amp; Me! Like Lucy w buying out bottles for her Red Hair, I Totally bought a Lifetime Supply of this some time ago. I have 3 new Bottles. This does NOT lose it&#x27;s Scent. If you have bought one that has, it wasn&#x27;t the REAL Deal or Watered Down. I was actually going to buy another bottle when I discovered how the PRICE SHOT 2 the ROOF! Apparently Someone Else like me bought out the Supply! I Will NEVER Sell Mine. The other scents that have Tried to Emulate it such as Sunflowers, &amp;amp; Ralph still FAIL!!! Love Watermelon &amp;amp; this is made from Watermelon. Kind of Cool that Noone has my Scent now. It really is WORTH Every Penny! Wish I&#x27;d Bought a TON of them.</li>
    <li> This gift was dearly appreciated when I gave it to my wife since it isw her favorite and no longer widely available.</li>
    <li> This was my signature scent long ago.  When it came back.. it is hard to sometimes get your hands on.. and if you find it, it is expensive.  This is a wonderful scent.  If you like Tommy Bahama or Estee Lauder Beyond Paradise ... it is in that scent category.  It is similar to Sun Flowers but more intoxicating and the scent lingers forever.  If you get on an elevator or pass someone.. it is not all that uncommon to have someone comment and ask \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot;  \\&quot; What is that Scent\\&quot;  And this is from both Sexes.  The thing about perfume etc.. is if it smells a little bit something like food.. Men love it.  This has a happy summer time scent.. and it helps get you through the cold winter months.  It is like having Spring/Summer in a bottle.  It is a make you feel happy, pep in your step kind of scent. Makes you just want to dance about it.  Okay so the bottle is not gorgeous... but that is all the more reason that the scent inside is most spectacular.  Pretty bottle is just that .. a pretty bottle..  Buy it .. you will adore this scent. Although I hate to tell everyone about my scent .. then it will not be my scent anymore. LOL.</li>
    <li> New West for Women~~ I&#x27;ve been wearing this for over 20 years it is my go to scent! I love it it&#x27;s clean and fresh~~ $399 on Amazon way too outrageous of a price when you could purchase in Macy&#x27;s for $50/ bottle. I get it&#x27;s no longer in production; but this is beyond price gouging!  If there is any one out there who is not happy with it, please contact me @ pathfinder1965@msn.com</li>
    <li> Wife said that it smelled as if it had been watered down or  diluted.</li>
    <li> i absolutily love this perfume. i can not find it anywhere in stores anymore. i will purchase this perfume from this company probably every 2 to 3 months. its the only perfume i wear !!! you keep sellng it i will keep buying it..  thank you   Holly</li>
    <li> I love this perfume but I refuse to pay three times more then I paid last year. So onto another choice.</li>

    <li> Thank you!!!!!  So fast and  it&#x27;s my favorite..  Please let me know when you get more.  You are the best.</li>

    <li> Love New West by Aramis. Not too heavy, Nice and light. People always comment on it. Is it really discontinued??</li>
    <li> To all you ladies that are unhappy with your scent... please, please contact me. pgraston@ hotmail.com&lt;br /&gt;I would love to take it off your hands- maybe we can make an arrangement that will work for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Paula</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent. This is New West for women. Was shipped as advertised and promptly.  Note: If you want this product, be sure to check as some sellers have a picture of New West for Women, but they are actually selling the fragrance for Men.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t wear anything else! Unfortunately, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find AND they&#x27;ve more than doubled the price! I know of women who love it but have changed scents because they can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t pay the inflated price :(</li>
    <li> Items arrived promptly,  they met my expectations wonderful quality.  Thanks and we order any product that I need with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,  M L Horton</li>
    <li> Finally found a cheaper bottle and it was &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; before I could get it</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for years and as the years have passed, the price keeps going up as it has been discontinued for some time now. I decided I would purchase 2 bottles before the next time I run out I will be paying triple the price. I was charged for 2 bottles but only received one - no packing slip or anything. I notified them right away and they responded that they shipped both. It wasn&#x27;t until I took pictures of the packing they said they would come up with a resolution. If they would have asked I would have preferred them to ship the bottle I paid for but instead they just credit me the difference.</li>
    <li> Having bought this alot before they stopped making it, the scent smells like avon for some reason, highly disappointing..hope Aramis starts making it again so to make sure it is real product.</li>
    <li> I had exclusively been wearing this perfume for well over 20 yrs.--practically since it came out on the market.  Now it&#x27;s only available if you want to pay between $400-500---absolute insanity.  I hope one day they bring it back.  Nothing, no matter what, will ever replace this scent for me.  Ever.  This used to be my skin/my smell/my signature.  I&#x27;ve been out testing other perfumes/fragrances and nothing comes close to the smell that New West had.</li>
