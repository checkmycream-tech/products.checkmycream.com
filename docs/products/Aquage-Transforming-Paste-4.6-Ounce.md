<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the Aquage Transforming Paste.</li>
    <li> Good non-greasy, low-residue product....a little goes a long way. A tube lasts me nearly a year!!! It seems to work best when you use a tiny dollop (pea-sized) in your palm and mix a few drops of water with it to coat your palms and fingers in a thin fimr of the stuff......</li>
    <li> I have used a million products during my life to try and fix my hair and this is the very best I have ever used. Only takes a drop. My hair is fine and straight, about chin length with layers and this stuff does the trick to give me some lift and style.  Easy to use. lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> After all the rave reviews of how this works on Asian hair I was really disappointed with my experience. I&#x27;m multi-ethnic and actually have multiple hair types on my head, but every person who has ever cut my hair has said that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; and has qualities closest to Asian hair. My issue with the product was that there was an incredibly small margin of error that I could never quite get down, if I even used slightly too much my hair would look like a greasy mess not unlike other pomade type products I&#x27;ve used, and if used slightly too little my hairstyle would be flat and unmanageable within 30 minutes. Some other products have that forgiveness (not sure what to call it) where you&#x27;re able to run your fingers through and reset your style but this one would get stuck in its unflattering mess mode.  For how it expensive it is I really thought I was stumbling onto some holy grail of hair products for slick-textured hair, wah wah.</li>
    <li> Best non-greasy hair paste. Doesn&#x27;t harden and provides perfect shape. I can&#x27;t find anything like it at regular retail stores. Well worth ordering online too, because it&#x27;ll cost almost double at your local salon.</li>
    <li> Medium control, looks natural and does not add any shine.  It doesn&#x27;t get hard like traditional gel or hairspray.  It lasts the day, with maybe a refresh in the evening.    Best part is it is 100% water soluble, after showering it&#x27;s gone completely. After daily usage it doesn&#x27;t build up in your hair like an oily pomade or a wax.    I have a bit coarse asian hair.</li>
    <li> I love using this paste after blow drying my hair.  My hair is very straight and thick.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found another product that holds and styles like this one - you don&#x27;t even need to use that much of it for it to be effective - I love it!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used... it&#x27;s just leaps and bounds better than anything else. I have difficult Asian-type hair. With most products there&#x27;s at least one downside -- durable but difficult to wash out, light but doesn&#x27;t last, etc. Aquage Transforming Paste has none whatsoever: it&#x27;s durable, doesn&#x27;t dry out (you can actually restyle it later if the wind messes it up), doesn&#x27;t look waxy or greasy, and washes out easily.  It&#x27;s very powerful, so a little goes a long way. Put a dime-sized amount or less on your fingers, rub together, and style from the roots up. I&#x27;ve had the best results when my hair is dry.  It seems expensive, but a 4.6-oz bottle will last for ages. I bought one almost year ago and have only used just over half of it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great for keeping hair in check without the \\&quot;grease helmet\\&quot; look. My hair is straight but course and tends to have a mind of its own without some additional weight and hold. Aquage works perfectly. Towel dry, rub a dime size bead into your fingertips, give a quick run through your hair and viola! No more chia pet. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> A drop the size of a pea will do wonders! This tube lasts forever!</li>
    <li> i have thick hair, and describe it as coarse.  it is manageable between washes, but looks rough when freshly washed.  this product makes it look smooth and gives it body at the same time.  i have sensitive skin, and don&#x27;t like a lot of product touching my face, due to skin irritation, but so far, have not had any problems here.  Def recommend this for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product and have used it for years.  Great service from this company.  I had gave them the wrong address and they sent it again without additinal charge.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff! Really glad that it is available on line; it has become difficult to find this product in stores.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this to me not too long ago and I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it. It&#x27;s not greasy looking or feeling and smells great. Once it&#x27;s dried it does not look like I have product in it (keeps hair looking soft). It&#x27;s not sticky once dry but has great hold. I have fine hair so I use only a tiny bit, I think of it as a \\&quot;bead\\&quot; once it comes out of the nozzle (it&#x27;s obvious what I mean once you use the product, the amount that comes out when you squeeze just a little bit), rub it between my fingers, then use my fingers to style my hair and it looks great.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the hold this stuff gives to her hair, and she gets many compliments!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products to get lift and some poof to my hair, this product is the best!!  Don&#x27;t use too much at once or it will flatten your hair.  You can always use more, so start with less!</li>
    <li> My son swear by this stuff!  This was a reorder.  Super service.  Fast delivery A+</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job for my thick hair.  Price was good also. Shipping cost could have been better. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery. Exactly what I ordered. Repeat purchase of this product.  I will order it from amazon when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It is not greasy and sculpting hair well. I used to buy it at the salons and happy to see it is sold at Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 13 years and I&#x27;ve tried others and nothing else compares.!!!!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this paste for over 5 years now. It is the only product I use and I have been very happy with it. It keeps the shape you give your hair for about 4- 6 hours, but then again I have thick hair and I do not use more than a nickel size of the product at a time. Maybe it would hold longer for people with thinner hair. Overall, the best hair paste/gel product I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried other store sold brands when I forgot the Aquage paste on a trip and they never work as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great &amp;#34; setting&amp;#34; product for my fine hair- I use Paul Mitchell elastic shaping paste to get some curl oomph and then when dry I use this product to finish..</li>
    <li> I use it as a styling tool.  Takes the fizz out of the hair and allows me to sculpture it as I want.</li>
    <li> I bought this gel and I&#x27;d have to say that it is NOT THAT BAD....not the best, as I was buying it with the intent that it would make my hair look like its in a NATURAL hold with no gel, but you can see some semblance that there is hair product in my hair, but other than that, this product DOES keep my hair where I wanna keep it so if thats your aim, then get this.</li>
    <li> I was just recently introduced to this amazing paste by my hairdresser.  Where has it been all my life!  Love the smell, which helps.  Most importantly it works!  Keeps the style in all day, washes out with no problem.  May seem spendy but I suspect I will have this for a long time as such a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairstylist 4 years ago. I am using it since then. Smells nicely too.</li>
    <li> Works well with my type of naturally wavy fine hair, giving it some extra body. Doesn&#x27;t take much so lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who has been fighting the wave in his gorgeous hair. Recommended by my sister because her husband has beautiful, wavy hair... We love it!! Thought it would be too sticky when we first went to apply...not at all. Holds GREAT!!! will buy again</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair product - it works fabulous on my fine thin hair and holds my hair in place longer than any other hair product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.  Great product and great service, Amazon! Will buy this product again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair maybe a bit too soft, &amp; at times looks, &amp; feels greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of hair products - mousse, gel, paste, pomade - and this one really beats them all.  Really good hold without being stiff, and lasts for the day. It applies evenly and is easy to wash out. I even found out that my wife nips a bit when she wants a bit of extra control. If they ever discontinue this stuff I will be gutted.</li>
    <li> i researched online for the best product for my new short hair style and thought i had come up with the ANSWER with this item.  It&#x27;s ok but not as good and much more expensive than the Got2beglued stuff!</li>
    <li> First, as every woman with hair knows, hair type matters. Mine is wavy/curly and a few months ago I cut it very short to get back to my \\&quot;real\\&quot; hair color and texture after years of highlighting and consequential damage to my long locks. Now that my hair is growing out (I like a shaggy/touseled look) its obvious some control was needed to get my bangs out of my eyes and to lift the heavy top layers. My friend at work introduced me to Aquage, by giving me some to experiment with. BOY! I&#x27;m hooked. The best part about this paste as compared to others I&#x27;ve tried is that it has a very light feel - I can keep adding to it for a more chunky look or on days when I crawl out of bed, take a wet wash cloth and rub it all over my head (yeah, I do that) and then while damp but not wet, take a little dab of paste - dime size- and rub it on both hands INCLUDING BETWEEN the fingers and then run both hands from my hair line, close to the scalp and all the way back along the side of my head. Then scrunch (or flatten) where needed. Waves, straight, whatever. Pretty neat fix. When going out for the evening instead of teasing the heck out of my crown hair I do extra chunky and it doesn&#x27;t look gooey either. Thats how it works for me. My friend loves it too - she has fine hair and uses it after blowdrying and using a curling iron. Her hair looks natural too - very important to me.  So, whether curly (like me) or fine (like Cleva&#x27;s) we love the way Aquage TRANSFORMS our hair. I really can&#x27;t explain how big a kick I get out of having a product that pleases. Its kind of expensive, I couldn&#x27;t find any salons that carried it even though they were mentioned on the official Aquage web site. When I called they no longer carried it (???)  I&#x27;m in Richmond, VA so our salons are pretty good. Found a deal on amazon.com (as usual) --- WORTH EVERY DOLLAR.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair that does not look wet all day but still has some hold. I have been using this exclusively for a few years now and I have not found anything better.</li>
    <li> Gives me just the right amount of lift at the roots and gets rid of any dry flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;I only use a tiny amount</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  Holds the hair but doesnt harden.  Only need a little dab of it.  It goes a long way</li>
    <li> This is the best paste for short hair!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I send it to my mom because she loves it too.</li>
    <li> I have used this now for years I love it ! wouldn&#x27;t use anything else , worth every penny !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 and have always had crazy thick and unmanageable hair w/o the aid of products. It&#x27;s literally taken me 25 years to find the right product that has a nice natural hold and doesn&#x27;t affect my scalp. My hair retains whatever style I go with while at the same time not looking like I&#x27;ve missed my calling as part of a 90s&#x27; boy band w/a ton of product on my head. The due/doo can be adjusted thru out the day as needed w/only a little water. This stuff is the best and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My stylist first used this when she did my hair and I fell in love with it!  It helps me to make my short hair into sassy short hair!  Smells fantastic - I love it!</li>
    <li> Good clean smell. Good for styling loner length hair. Washes out easily in the shower.</li>
    <li> Use a little or a lot, this product gets the job done. I go back &amp; forth between this and Crew&#x27;s roughing paste or something that comes in a little circular container with green labels.  Hair might shift, but it lasts all day  &amp; night so you can restyle it.</li>
    <li> I just love Aquage Transforming Paste.  I have used this product for years.  I have short hair.  I have tried every type of product known to man to give me control and hold and separation...none hold a candle to Transforming Paste.  If at the end of the day I need a touch up, I just wet my hands and reshape my hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I thought this was natural hair product and much to my dismay it contains 4 different parabens. I am sending it back!</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair and this product manages it like a dream! After I dry my hair, I put a little of the transforming paste in my hair and it does just that....transforms my hair into a great looking style!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair--this is the only product that works for me! Gives you a tousled look without weighing your hair down too much. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Each person has product that works best for their hair and after many other brands, I&#x27;ve finally found mine. It is versatile and can be used on wet or dry hair. I keep a short, spiky cut, and this keeps my hair spiked without being stiff and can be restyled midday, if needed. Washes out very cleanly and easily. Much better price than from my haircutter.</li>
    <li> Never found a good gel (I am 42 year old man) that would survive rain, wind blowing in from my moon roof, or humid/hot weather. All gels dry up and look to plastic like.this paste looks natural with no plastic glue look!    Someone recommended this Aquage Transforming Paste (found bigger tube versus hard plastic smaller size--a better deal on amazon than where I previously bought on-line)and it is gr8!  When my hair is just cut (short) it can satnd up and I need stuff to calm it down.    Use a very small amount (dime size) and put in after washing, I brush through and let hair dry naturally (can blow dry to if have to run out immediately).  It keeps hair manageable (When my hair is to short is I need to calm it down). sometimes after fast driving or humidity it gets  out of sorts, I just put some water in my hands slick through and it seems to reactivate product and hold.</li>
    <li> Aquage provides a gentle pick up to my hair which lasts for hours!  Thank you for a great product.  I am using it on every trip,</li>
    <li> I got this two days after I ordered it!  It is the best hair \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; it&#x27;s not a gel or a wax - it is more like a pomade - it doesn&#x27;t dry and it isn&#x27;t greasy - but you can use too much and than it will look greasy.  Either way - a dab will do ya - and it is great - and you can always just add a bit of water if you need to rework it later in the day.  Shipping was super fast - it wasn&#x27;t supposed to get here until the 7th and it showed up today (5 days earlier  So I am very happy with this buy, great prodect, and great store - sent it as soon as the payment went through.  Will def order from here next time I need this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. It&#x27;s really easy to style wet or dry, doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look nasty or oily, especially if you run your fingers through your hair once it is completely dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the best price I have ever seen it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years!! Don&#x27;t want to live without it.  It is like putting the final accent touches on a painting! It may seem expensive, but I don&#x27;t use a lot, so it isn&#x27;t expensive compared to other pastes and hair gels that run out faster for me.  I also use the fiber gum...fiber spikes stuff that is by Fructis, and that product is very good and smells good too -- but this stuff is what I use for finishing touches.  I have short &amp;#34;sassy&amp;#34; hair and when having a &amp;#34;bad hair day&amp;#34; Aquage can fix anything.  I have fine hair and a full &amp;#34;piecy&amp;#34; hair style.  Almost every single day of my life I get compliments on my hair -- and I really believe that Aquage Transforming paste is part of the reason for that.  It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; feeling, or too sticky after you put it in.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down like oilier pastes or waxes after time has passed... It&#x27;s mold-able for almost any type of hair style.  People with thicker hair, coarser hair, or longer hair use it well from what I&#x27;ve seen and heard. I rub it between my fingers and mold the hair how I want it.  It doesn&#x27;t dull it up either. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
    <li> i put this in my hair and automatically turn into a porn star. people call me ron jeremy when i use this product</li>
    <li> This is the only &#x27;stiff&#x27; paste I use.  It&#x27;s tough to find in salons -- but so much better than what you can buy at CVS.</li>
    <li> I like the hold of this item, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started having a weird reaction to what I think is the chemical composition right on the front of my head. It got very dry and flaky, so I stopped using. Some people might not have the same reaction since we&#x27;re all different. For pure function of the item, it works with some good to better hold than some of the items I&#x27;ve used in the past (i.e. Axe)</li>
    <li> Best thing ever, lasts all day, you only need to use a little bit so it lasts months and it leaves no smell</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a number of years! Easy, clean, stays in wind! Will brush right out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Every once in a while I try some other hair paste...but I always come back to Aquage&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love this product- not greasy and holds style all day. I&#x27;ve tried several expensive salon&lt;br /&gt;products and not as effective as aquage.</li>
    <li> My husband is notoriously picky about his hair and the products he uses. He has used Aquage for several years with no problems. From time to time we try similar products and he always hates them. We will always buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> This works well for spiky hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this!  I can fix my hair with my wand and then put this in it and my curls last for days!  It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> This is what I was exactly looking for. Same exact product for a great price. These guys were the least expensive with a reasonable shipping price. I will reorder from these guys for sure.</li>
    <li> As a guy with thick hair I wanted a product that would go on easy and hold all day. I also wanted it to wash out easy and this has been the best I have ever found.</li>
    <li> I have very short Indian hair.  I purchased this product to spike up my hair, and have it stay spiked up.  It does not do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a small amount on damp hair, and it does add a finished look.  When first applied, it does style the hair (even spiked up).  However, the hair does not stay styled, and falls down after an hour.  I&#x27;m not saying it looks bad, but this product doesn&#x27;t do what it sets out to do (provide strong hold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was really expensive, and I purchased it because I was impressed by the great reviews.  Sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the smell is really nice, and the product really does wash out with water.  Although this makes me wonder what happens to your hairstyle when caught in a rainstorm or snowstorm (I live in Chicago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very meh product.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Yes, the price is a little high but the product makes up for it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used another product as good as this one.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product while living in WI 15+ years ago.  It is hard to find down South.  For my hair it is the only paste that actually holds my style in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the quick shipment!&lt;br /&gt;I so look forward to using this again!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. A couple dabs in my wet hands, mix it well, and into my wet hair give me all the style I need, for blow drying. The tube lasts for a LONG time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, smells great holds well. Product is amazing recommend it to anyone looking to style their hair.</li>
    <li> I love this paste! It works really well in any hair and the hold last all day. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wish they made a 3 oz container so I could fly with it.  Great hold without making your hair look all greasy.</li>
    <li> Aquage Products are some of the best hair products on the market.  I am surprised more people don&#x27;t know this product!</li>
    <li> It only takes a tiny bit to style your hair. Never looks greasy and dries quick. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a styling product</li>
    <li> Have short thin hair and have searched for a product that gives my hair volume and hold without looking like I&#x27;m wearing grease, this is an awesome product. Done searching.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I got my hair shorter and layered and this works great to rub on my fingertips and rub through my hair. It gives me great texture and a little hold. I still have to put a little hairspray in to keep it in place. It makes my hair shiny and does not make it oily or greasy feeling. Would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> White guy with thin hair so this is best for me and dont flake or feel oilly like other products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and this is by far the best hair paste I have found for short styles. I have pin straight/fine hair and chopped it all off earleir in the year. Not only does this product keep my hair in place, but it gives it fabulous texture. It&#x27;s also nice that it comes in a squeeze tube. I loathe hair paste in a jar.</li>
    <li> A tube of this wil last me (and my husband) about 4 months...I use very little at a time and it works magnificiently on my fine thin hair- doesn&#x27;t weight it down and gives it that &amp;#34;seperated&amp;#34; look and calms down fly away&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> The Aquage paste and straightening gel work great and the straightening gel is good for tangled hair!  The seller was Super nice during transaction and all of my questions! Thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you have short hair and want to style it with some fluff and staying power, this is the product to use. It only takes a dab and therefore it lasts a long time. Just don&#x27;t use too much or your hair gets greasy.</li>
    <li> Love how it gives my hair a piecier more youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;It makes hair more shapeable.  Cannot live without it.</li>
    <li> Really like this product, have used it for years, great hold without that &amp;#34;crisp&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair, spikey here and there, Aquage is a wonderful pastey substance, allowing me to spike where I want, hold where I want, and easily removed, from hands and hair. I have tried every paste, cement &amp; glue, from every price range, and now that I have found Aquage on Amazon, I no longer wish it was sold in &amp;#34;drugstores&amp;#34; AMEN lgl</li>
    <li> Just what I needed Works well</li>
    <li> Made my hair smooth and shiney.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this product is great for spiking it out in the back.  It is not stiff, but as the name states, a paste texture.  I love it, been using it for 3 years!</li>
    <li> It came on time, and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> The best hair product I have ever come across. Produces great definition without stiffness or stickiness.</li>
    <li> Awesome, smells like paste and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Bought two of these.  Been using this product for two years.  This is the best paste/gel you can ever buy.  creates a natural hold and can even hair spray on top of it if you need to.    Arrived extremely fast.  I was thinking of going to a salon on the weekend to purchase this.  Instead ordered it on a monday and received it before the weekend even came at my doorstep.</li>
    <li> Same product as used by my own hairdresser.  Works well with just a very small amount.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my hair I have fine thin hair and this works great.</li>
    <li> This product is terrific. I have used it for about 8 years. When the salon I visit stopped carrying it, I switched to purchases on line. I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> This product gives my hair body that stays all day.  Good for volume challenged hair.  You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
    <li> Good product... Good shipping time...thanks!</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that this product thickened hair.. It does to an extent but doesn&#x27;t perform as well as the product I curr5enytly use.</li>
    <li> A awesome product that has always worked in my hair. Its sad that you can&#x27;t find this product in a beauty shop. It takes a small amount and works for hours.</li>
    <li> Love this product and glad I found it online&lt;br /&gt;It keeps hair in place and u use less hair spray</li>
    <li> Very good product. I have used it for 5 years and it works perfectly every time I put in on.</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE AND PRICE</li>
    <li> One of the best...use it all the time</li>
    <li> I only received a trial size of this paste from another supplier.  The supplier for this size canceled the order and was unable to fill.  I will try to reorder the larger size.</li>
    <li> great stuff.  good price</li>
    <li> It is often hard for me to get out and since I am a prime member I typically order many things online.  My hairdresser used this product and I really liked the fact that it did not make my hair feel sticky or crunchy after it was dry.  If you have thin hair it definitely holds well especially during humid times.  I am not sure how well it works for thicker/coarser hair, but if you have fine/soft hair that has little to no bounce, this is the perfect product.  Seller priced it fairly and I received it on time.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way better then gel. I would we keep purchasing this item over and over again. I highly recommend this item to anyone who hates gel.</li>
    <li> Definitely easy to put on and wash off. Doesn&#x27;t show any gloss or gel like flakes after an entire days use. Definitely a buy for me!</li>
    <li> Have used this product in the past. A little goes a long way and keeps my hair the way I like it. Would definitely recommend this product for people who wear their hair short and spiky.</li>
    <li> Great hold, hair does not feel dirty, keeps hair in place all day.  Used by professionals, recommed it to everyone..</li>
    <li> It was very watery. Didn&#x27;t seem like the original paste I usually get from Aquage.</li>
    <li> Most effective hair product I used.  Adds nice shine and holds style well.  I plan continue use of this product.</li>
    <li> My son uses this every day to style his hair and i couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Very easy to use.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff everyday for my short hair do - sets on its own, and washes out readily with water (although I use soap too). Not too sticky and not smelly. This is the preferred packaging, the pump is not easy to recycle AND hangs onto about 1/2 ounce of product. Will buy this container for as long as it is available. I have been using this stuff for years.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is the only product I have found that works on my short, soft hair.</li>
    <li> I love this paste. Pliable, non-greasy, lightweight, smells good. It holds well, but you can easily move and change the style as many times as you want. Your hair will not fell hard or crusty or flake. It gives body, thickness, fullness, washes clean. I put this in my hair in the morning for work, &amp; when I go out at night all I do is wet my hands &amp; restyle my hair - holds great! I have short /med length hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this paste for years!  I moved to Oklahoma and could not find it at my local salon, so I checked Amazon!  Great price and fast service.  I have short and spiked style of hair and this puts it where you want it, brushes out nicely and does not build up, feel greasy or gummy on the hair.  I have tried many other brands but this one is the best for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It gives my short hair great texture and is easy to work with. Product came as described and on time.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend, especially for those with short hairstyles.</li>
    <li> Transform your style into a work of art!  It is an excellent way to manage your hair and a must when humidity tries to destory your style.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it washes right out and its thick enough when you space it out but not too thick so that it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
    <li> You will need to know the perfect amount to put on your hair to get this product to work for you. This will also depend on the type of hair you have meaning finer hair will require much less paste.  Once I got it figure out this is the product for me.</li>
    <li> I received the product quick and it met and exceeded my expectations of what it should do with my hair!!!</li>
    <li> This product lasts all day and washes out easily with just water. Keeps the hairs where you want them. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this product and this is one of the few places I can find it. Please continue to carry it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this paste for about two weeks now, and really love it!  I have shoulder-length wavy hair, and I use this to piece out the ends and make the clumps have more definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice, subtle smell to it, and washes out easily. It also doesn&#x27;t feel gummy in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is I&#x27;ve found that I can&#x27;t re-apply it a second day without my ends getting gummy on that second day.  Overall, though, it&#x27;s a great paste!</li>
    <li> I like this because it&#x27;s not greasy and you only need a little bit. It goes on very smoothly and the tube lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Great product, something I can recommend. Why? Because it does what it advertises. It gives my hair body and it holds my hair style until I retire unless I am outside in very windy conditions and even then I only need to run my fingers through my hair to return it a a nice fresh styled look again.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for messy hair.  Love it. Use it all the time. You cannot go wrong using this product.</li>
    <li> I like my hair to be well managed, but not stiff.  After many years of many different products my stylist suggested the Transforming Paste.  I have used nothing else since, and never will.&lt;br /&gt;This product provides good manageability but never gets stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try if you want control without stiffness.</li>
    <li> I am on a mission to find a replacement for Texture Twist, so thought I would give this a try based on all the great reviews.  This product is so stiff, I could hardly work it into my hair - just did not like it at all - unfortunately, it is probably going in the trash, as I am sure most of my friends wouldn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
    <li> The product description says non-greasy formula, but I actually find it rather greasy. In my opinion, a &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; is drier than this, more like, well, paste. This is more of a glue consistency. I feel like my hair looks oily after I use this, but maybe I had misguided expectations. I will continue to try however--- wet hair, dry hair, use less or more, etc., because the reviews are so positive. I must be missing something.</li>
    <li> I have been unable to locate this product at any of the local salons.  My last tube lasted almost 5 years.  It&#x27;s a great product and I am so happy to find a source.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff, feels different from any other products....even Aveda. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is the best paste hands down. Pliable, non-greasy, lightweight, smells good. It holds like nobody&#x27;s business, but you can easily move and change the style as many times as you want. It doesn&#x27;t get hard or crusty or flake. It gives body, thickness, fullness, washes clean. Just perfect in my pinion. And it is the only product by this brand that I like, but they have made a hit with this stuff. I used this product on all male clients and it worked great with them all. It is good in womens hair too, shorter styles though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for several years. You dont need much, a dime size dallop will do, rub between your hands for a minute till it gets tacky then style your hair..I still use alittle spray,if its windy out..Highly recommend this product.  Also shipping was fast....</li>
    <li> Keeps hair soft while spiked or just adding volume...love it!</li>
    <li> I avetried many many pastes and gels but Aquage is the absolute BEST! You dont have to use much to get the desired result.</li>
    <li> I have a friend tell me about this paste. She is right, it is very good and holds extremely well. Word of caution, do not use any more than you need or hair will look dirty, not greasy just dirty.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and delivery time was appropriate. I will purchase as needed</li>
    <li> If you like a thick, heavy paste for your hair this is it.  I have long hair and it did not work that well for me, but for short, layered hair, I can see it being great.</li>
    <li> Liked the old paste better. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good as before.</li>
    <li> Works good! not greasy</li>
    <li> Good pruduct, came quickly, delivery on time.  It is not gressy and does leave hair looking natural. Wanted a more of a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look, but this is not for that.  Over all satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> This product is too gummy and packs the hair down rather than acting as a styling aid. Went in the trash.</li>
    <li> Pretty expensive for stuff that didn&#x27;t really work for me. Has a great smell but I needed more hold.  Made my hair feel awful.</li>
    <li> Overall. Idea is good but needs more detail as to what foods to eat and when.listing foods would b good , and how much. sounds like u can eat as much as u want,  probably not a good idea.</li>
    <li> After having been introduced to this product in a salon, I was unable to find it in stores.  I was excited to find it on Amazon and the reasonable price.  It is an amazing paste for my fine yet thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine, thinner hair and this stuff is perfect for it. It adds just enough texture for control and fullness. And a little goes a very long way. I only have to purchase twice a year and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Have been using it for years and it is the only product of this type that seems to work on my hair.  It does everything the product claims and my hair stays in place until the next washing.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go a day with out it!&lt;br /&gt;Great Seller -Fast Shipping!-Simple.....the way I like it!...W00T!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I put it at the roots of my hair after I stylet to give it a little lift. They can also be used on wet hair to give it more volume</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product that my husband likes for his particular hair type and style. The price in the salon is outrageously high. This is by the far the best price and delivery mode.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  Use only a very small amount and keeps hair looking less frizzy and fly away and separates the hairs if you have that type of hair cut.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel I used yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost 10 years.  I&#x27;ve tried other products like this and NOTHING comes close!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!  You will too!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite hair product. It helps thicken my hair if applied when wet. Helps to piece out my hair if applied when hair is dry. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and always come back to this.</li>
</ol>
