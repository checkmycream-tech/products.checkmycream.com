      <li>It&#x27;s kind of</li>
      <li>I now own two.  </li>
      <li>so its nice to stash in a bag.</li>
      <li>Nice product</li>
      <li>It creates perfect lines when there is not too much product.</li>
      <li>While a great idea this didn&#x27;t really turn out to be a great tool for me.  </li>
      <li>surprisingly well and application was smooth, too.</li>
      <li>great brushes easy to clean</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the silicone brush for my Halloween makeup-to create wiggly fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I also got one for my sister and she likes it because it gives her a very precise line for the flick as she struggles with this before</li>
      <li>but I already love the way it applies my eyeliner.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Real techniques&amp;#34; my brushes from China are more durable.</li>
      <li>I love this liner brush.</li>
      <li>but I have better brushes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I love this thing because I use it for my waterline.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I purchased this product.</li>
      <li>but that just bc of the eyeliner being more liquid nothing to do with the brush.</li>
      <li>I love this liner brush.  </li>
      <li>It did a phenomenal job with both.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made for more of a liquid then a gel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a pretty good experience with this seller though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am happy to report that I had no trouble using it.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean also!</li>
      <li>This brush is easy to use and easy to clean!  </li>
      <li>The reason why its great for the waterline is because its soft, easy to sanitize, easy to wipe off, flexible, and you cant get stray bristles poking you in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use cake eyeliner and finding a tool to apply it evenly and in a controlled manner is not that easy.</li>
      <li>Easy to create the wings at the end.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem more precise, and honestly the non-silicone version is pretty easy to clean already.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the fine liner brush.</li>
      <li>It works fabulously.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a fantastic eyeliner brush for winged liner, try Sigma&#x27;s E06.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bought this silicone brush at the recommendation of a friend, and it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been paid for this review; I just really think any kind of makeup brush can&#x27;t get any better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The tip is soft and flexible which is good and</li>
      <li>I tested it with my old gel liner because I wanted to see how good it was...</li>
      <li>But just to warn you, you need to do small strokes for it to look the best.</li>
      <li>Small strokes work the best!</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t go on smoothly because the product came off quickly since the liner doesn&#x27;t soak into the silicone brush when applying.  </li>
      <li>Really useful and makes a winged eye easy to creat.</li>
      <li>Eyeliner goes on smoothly and the brush rinses off and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>The tips are super sturdy, they create super fine lines, dots, and marks, and work with all sorts of paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thought I would really love this brush and turned out to not like it so much.  </li>
      <li>I love all of Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>Not bad</li>
      <li>It picks up just the right amount of my gel eyeliner and it glides so smoothly when applying.</li>
      <li>and it dries quickly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one piece of silicone that is flexible and makes very nice, clean lines with little effort.</li>
      <li>Easy to wash (I just rub some makeup remover in my palm and gently rub the brush into it).</li>
      <li>This thing definitely doesnt work better than the normal eyeliner brush and you do kind of have to keep reapplying product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Brush tip is very flexible and is comfortable during use.</li>
      <li>I actually use these brushes to PAINT on a canvas, and they are AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Takes some practice, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>tip.&lt;br /&gt;Not really useful for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyways, I was really excited to try this brush, but I really dislike it quite a bit.</li>
      <li>Im not a make up artist , im a novice on the subject of make up , but if you are like me and want to achieve the perfect winged eyeliner look or just simply want to define your lash line , then this is the brush for you.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t see the advantage of the silicone except being slightly easier to clean.  </li>
      <li>If I have better luck later I will update my review but for right now I&#x27;m using the brush my liner came with.</li>
      <li>I might recommend going to Ulta to buy it noting it&#x27;ll save you a few bucks, but still a great product at a decent price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say much much better than a regular brush.</li>
      <li>you are an artist and looking for a super fine brush to create tiny, intricate marks, give this a try.</li>
      <li>I tried this with both gel liner and eye pigment (dipped brush in water first, then dipped into pigment).  </li>
      <li>Much better and smoother than using a regular brush</li>
      <li>It produces the finest of lines, is easy to clean, and all that&#x27;s needed to dry it off is to wipe off with a towel.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t make me return the other product or anything, so it was really nice that it wasn&#x27;t a hassle.</li>
      <li>The brush in general is great for first time gel liner users, but as a &amp;#34;seasoned&amp;#34; makeup artist I think it was (personally) a waste of my money.</li>
      <li>When I tried to get my gel liner on the silicone brush, I needed to put a lot on it so that it would spread, but then it would be so much liner that it was chunky.</li>
      <li>The silicone doesn&#x27;t pick up much product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know...I like gel eyeliners and was hoping to this brush for it. However, I think it&#x27;s easier to use a liner brush than this. It&#x27;s a bit hard to use.</li>
    <li> It is perfect to apply gel eyeliner, it really works.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why this liner have such good reviews. I almost feel like the reviewers didn&#x27;t even use the brush but hey.&lt;br /&gt;I dislike this brush because not only do you have to dip several times for product as others have mentioned but the times I have used it it leaves indentation/empty gap in my line. It&#x27;s kind of like I passed a toothpick over it line type of thing.&lt;br /&gt;So in essence it picks back up the product. Of course I didn&#x27;t get a pic but you can see it in this image url where there&#x27;s a gap in this girl&#x27;s lines:&lt;br /&gt;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZCweY_Gn1Lc/Uuxz78U-BlI/AAAAAAAAL3Y/rJ7x0mUpZRg/s1600/20140131_224531+edit.jpg</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this liner! It works great with gel eyeliner!</li>
    <li> easy to clean, not really good for its purpose.</li>
    <li> Much better and smoother than using a regular brush</li>
    <li> good bye brushes! this silicone design is awesome who ever thought of this was brilliant. no more smudge. you can&#x27;t get it wrong. Im not a make up artist , im a novice on the subject of make up , but if you are like me and want to achieve the perfect winged eyeliner look or just simply want to define your lash line , then this is the brush for you. great product , great price.&lt;br /&gt;I use this w/ gel crème liner from L&#x27;Oreal . you will have to dip the tip and glide along and it&#x27;s just that simple.</li>
    <li> this brush has help me a lot whith my liner but still its no better than a flat or angle liner brush</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for making NO mistakes. Of course that if you use it with old and stiff gel liner you will have problems, but less than with any other brush. I tested it with my old gel liner because I wanted to see how good it was...</li>
    <li> Like all of the Real Technique brushes, this one is unsurpassed. I know of no other like it. It produces the finest of lines, is easy to clean, and all that&#x27;s needed to dry it off is to wipe off with a towel. The rest of the brushes are high quality as well. Each brush is packed with bristles. I especially love the duo fiber collection brushes. They&#x27;re perfect for blending in stuff : blush, eyeshadow, etc. I haven&#x27;t been paid for this review; I just really think any kind of makeup brush can&#x27;t get any better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the silicone brush for my Halloween makeup-to create wiggly fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This brush I bought to use it with my Clinique gel eyeliner. It works okay but I have better brushes.</li>
    <li> Still learning how to use this but I already love the way it applies my eyeliner. Update: breaks easy, be careful</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use with a cream liner, and it just does not hold the liner well. When trying to apply liner with it I am left with an area in the middle of the line that just does hold color. I could be using this incorrectly and will continue trying. If I have better luck later I will update my review but for right now I&#x27;m using the brush my liner came with.</li>
    <li> LOVE this liner brush! It picks up just the right amount of my gel eyeliner and it glides so smoothly when applying. It is so comfortable when lining the upper and lower waterlines. All of the bristled eyeliner brushes I&#x27;ve tried are scratchy and rough, but the Real Techniques liner brush&#x27;s silicone tip is soft, smooth, and flexible. I won&#x27;t use any other liner brush when apply makeup on clients or myself.</li>
    <li> Really useful and makes a winged eye easy to creat.</li>
    <li> Perfection! I can do an excellent cat eye with this AND it doesn&#x27;t get stiff from being clogged with makeup as traditional brushes do.</li>
    <li> it was a gift and the receiver loved it.</li>
    <li> This is the asbolute BEST brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I will never use anything else again.  I tried this with both gel liner and eye pigment (dipped brush in water first, then dipped into pigment).  It did a phenomenal job with both.  Seriously, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> I have only tried using this a couple times, but so far I don&#x27;t like it at all. I thought it would be like using a pen, but it&#x27;s not that great for gel liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had imagined it would be better than a brush, as sometimes, the hairs on a brush don&#x27;t stay together, making your line uneven or ragged looking. When I tried to get my gel liner on the silicone brush, I needed to put a lot on it so that it would spread, but then it would be so much liner that it was chunky. Then the chunks would just glob all over my eye and not look remotely like a line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like, when you use a brush, the brush holds the product (eye liner) within the hairs of the brush, between them, coating them, almost like it absorbs it. When you use the silicone brush, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;absorb&amp;#34; anything, it is just on the outside of the brush, and once you touch it to your skin, it is all used up (like, you can&#x27;t drag it across your skin and get more color to come out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I was really excited to try this brush, but I really dislike it quite a bit. I would not recommend getting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a pretty good experience with this seller though. I originally go the wrong product, and when I informed them, they apologized and sent me the liner brush. They didn&#x27;t make me return the other product or anything, so it was really nice that it wasn&#x27;t a hassle. I would purchase other products from them again.</li>
    <li> I used this brush all of one time...and that one time was amazing! BUT, when I tried to clean the gel liner off of the silicone end of the brush, I guess I pulled too hard? And the entire silicone tip came out and it cannot be put back in...so I had to throw it in the garbage. I will definitely buy another one. I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because it was a user error and not the brushes fault that i pulled the silicone tip out...It works fabulously.</li>
    <li> Use for nail art and manicure clean-ups around my cuticles.  Seems well made.</li>
    <li> Brush tip is very flexible and is comfortable during use.</li>
    <li> hard to use. I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
    <li> I use cake eyeliner and finding a tool to apply it evenly and in a controlled manner is not that easy. Some of the eyeliner brushes on the market are too small and thin, others are too thick. Some are too soft, others too hard. So when I bought this Silicone brush, I was fairly skeptical that it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that I had no trouble using it. The brush (it really isn&#x27;t a brush, it is made out of one small piece of silicone) held the moistened eyeliner &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; surprisingly well and application was smooth, too. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Not as flexible as I expected, and I found it harder to apply liner with this silicone applicator. Might work better if tip were actually bristles instead of a solid piece of silicone.</li>
    <li> I use gel liner and thought that this brush would be a great tool.  When I used it I had to reload it with liner multiple times to finish each eye. it didn&#x27;t go on smoothly because the product came off quickly since the liner doesn&#x27;t soak into the silicone brush when applying.  The result was that it took much longer to apply my eyeliner. While a great idea this didn&#x27;t really turn out to be a great tool for me.  I&#x27;ll stick to my bent liner brush for now.</li>
    <li> My daughter says it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> I use have a cream eyeliner and it was a lot easier to apply with this brush (if u can call it that lol). The tip is soft and flexible which is good and the handle is very thin which I also like. I have no complaints. Still have to say I prefer regular liquid eyeliner but that just bc of the eyeliner being more liquid nothing to do with the brush. Great product and ull prolly not find many like it. I&#x27;d say much much better than a regular brush.</li>
    <li> This thing definitely doesnt work better than the normal eyeliner brush and you do kind of have to keep reapplying product.&lt;br /&gt;However, I love this thing because I use it for my waterline. The reason why its great for the waterline is because its soft, easy to sanitize, easy to wipe off, flexible, and you cant get stray bristles poking you in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;I also tend to use this to touch up all of my eyeliner in general so its nice to stash in a bag.</li>
    <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
    <li> Amazing Brush..putting eyeliner never been easier...i would purchase it again and again. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> great brushes easy to clean</li>
    <li> Not bad but it doesn&#x27;t pick the cream product well and it dries quickly and I need to use alot of prduct so  I prefer the fine liner brush. I also got one for my sister and she likes it because it gives her a very precise line for the flick as she struggles with this before but still it needs alot of the cream product.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner brush! it works very good with gel and also mineral eyeliner</li>
    <li> Was really disappointed in this. It&#x27;s made for more of a liquid then a gel.</li>
    <li> The tip already broke off.. SMH!!!!</li>
    <li> I use a gel eyeliner (http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-Studio-Lasting-Eyeliner-Blackest/dp/B0030HNNS6/) and as decent as some brushes can be, most just lose their shape or crap out over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this silicone brush at the recommendation of a friend, and it is fantastic. It&#x27;s one piece of silicone that is flexible and makes very nice, clean lines with little effort. Easy to wash (I just rub some makeup remover in my palm and gently rub the brush into it). I might recommend going to Ulta to buy it noting it&#x27;ll save you a few bucks, but still a great product at a decent price.</li>
    <li> Nice product but i use it only to draw the angle of my eyeliner out of my eyes.. cuz the silicon not like the hair brush. U need to use the gel liner every second</li>
    <li> The silicone liner is great, it makes the best lines.</li>
    <li> Love this! The only issue I have is I can&#x27;t tell how much I pick up on the liner and sometimes it goops on my lid. It creates perfect lines when there is not too much product. Takes some practice, but well worth it. I only use gel liner with this and it works out great.</li>
    <li> I love this liner brush.  I now own two.  I love all of Real Techniques brushes.  They feel very expensive but they are priced very reasonable!</li>
    <li> does not get dry when i use it with cream \ gel liner! and thats good</li>
    <li> I am very meh about this brush.  I much prefer the non-silicone version of this.  The silicone doesn&#x27;t pick up much product so you have to keep stopping to dip the brush back in.  I honestly don&#x27;t see the advantage of the silicone except being slightly easier to clean.  It doesn&#x27;t seem more precise, and honestly the non-silicone version is pretty easy to clean already.  If you&#x27;re looking for a fantastic eyeliner brush for winged liner, try Sigma&#x27;s E06.</li>
    <li> This brush is easy to use and easy to clean!  Eyeliner goes on smoothly and the brush rinses off and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Thought I would really love this brush and turned out to not like it so much.  The eyeliner is much harder to put on using it than I expected.  It&#x27;s not like a real brush to it doesn&#x27;t glide over your eyelid which makes it quite hard to put on.</li>
    <li> I am actually looking for something that I can use in the kitchen to attach decorations to cakes and cookies.  I bought this item hoping that this will do the trick.  It&#x27;s nice and soft.  It appears that it may be of use in craft projects as well.  Seller shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s broke when I slid it out of the package. &amp;#34;Real techniques&amp;#34; my brushes from China are more durable. Although I do like how soft and flexible the silicone tip is.</li>
    <li> Works well with gel eyeliner. I find that it&#x27;s much easier to work with this silicone tip, compared to other eyeliner brushes made from hair. Easy to create the wings at the end. Also easy to make thin or thick lines. I am glad that I purchased this product. Would buy it again. Definitely.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this at the time, but it&#x27;s actually just a piece of silicone as a tip.&lt;br /&gt;Not really useful for me.</li>
    <li> This is aweful. Skips and leaves streaks even with the best gel eyeliners. Good idea, sadly just a bad product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this brush, it works fantastically.</li>
    <li> I actually use these brushes to PAINT on a canvas, and they are AMAZING. The tips are super sturdy, they create super fine lines, dots, and marks, and work with all sorts of paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are an artist and looking for a super fine brush to create tiny, intricate marks, give this a try. I know it&#x27;s meant for makeup, but it works wonderfully with paint, too!</li>
    <li> I love this liner brush. It is great for applying gel liner. Easy to clean also!</li>
    <li> This is such a cool brush. I have such a difficult time making a cat eye but this thing does the job. This is brilliant and more people need to try it. But just to warn you, you need to do small strokes for it to look the best. If you just try lining your eye like a normal brush its gonna get messy because it&#x27;s silicone and not as much product get on it like a hair brush. Makeup brushes with hairs will collect more makeup throughout the hairs and so it&#x27;s easier to slap it on, but this give sharp lines if you use it correctly. Small strokes work the best!</li>
    <li> Very nice for applying gel liner I love it!</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this eyeliner &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;. The tip is silicone as the name says, and it&#x27;s difficult to get the product to apply correctly. As you&#x27;re tracing the eye it leave empty spots because the liner brush leave most of the product in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy with this brush. It may work for you, definitely didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The brush in general is great for first time gel liner users, but as a &amp;#34;seasoned&amp;#34; makeup artist I think it was (personally) a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it will be</li>
    <li> Still learning how to use it. Doesn&#x27;t really pick up powder shadows very well not even wet.</li>
