<li> I have other Gel Toe Crest Products that are SOFT and give you the relief you need.</li>

<li> They function as well as can be expected.</li>

<li> Thought that this was  silly idea, but willing to try anything for hammer toes and resulting calusses.</li>
<li> For my size 9 foot, the &amp;#34;lump&amp;#34; of the pad was always uncomfortable, particularly under big toe, and loop was too tight around toe.</li>
<li> The silicone in this product has NO GIVE and is like a hard lump under your toes which only adds to your discomfort.</li>
<li> for me it was just money down the drain.</li>
<li> /&gt;it will hold your toe down the &amp;#34;long</li>
<li> toe.&lt;br /&gt;Please clarify my previous review.</li>
<li> the reinforced toe ring causes the pad to be too tight because it has no give and will not stretch with movement</li>
<li> That way the loop is not to tight.  </li>
<li> Problem I have with hammer toes (as a result of a broken heel) is the pressure on the tips of my toes when walking causes the nails to turn blue and the toes to hurt.  </li>
<li> and unfortunately I thought these were the same type I had previously ordered and ordered three for each foot.</li>
<li> It feels a little hard with wearing with shoes and walking around.</li>
<li> , I wear everyday and it has resulted in my toes slowly straightening and the calusses on the tops of the hammer toes have gone away.</li>
<li> I need to clarify my last review - The gel was difficult for my husband to place on his hammer</li>
<li> Toe loop is to small, one size does not fit all!</li>
<li> They never wear out, just get a little tired.</li>
<li> They are always too thick for my toesies anyways.  </li>
<li> These are WAY to stiff, and therefore too uncomfortable to use.</li>
<li> Very hard to wear them</li>
<li> It made it worse.  </li>
<li> The loop is too stiff,which practically strangles your toe and the compound is too hard making them very uncomfortable.</li>
<li> The curvature of the crest bothers my toes when I have socks and shoes on and makes it uncomfortable walking.  </li>
<li> He just loves this product and thinks it will keep him from having to have the painful surgery.</li>
<li> base of this device and others like it rests in that area</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Toe loop is to small, one size does not fit all! Can not wear all day</li>
    <li> They function as well as can be expected. The gel is a good texture for wearing barefooted or in stocking feet. It feels a little hard with wearing with shoes and walking around. I use it to reduce the under curling of my toes from Parkinson&#x27;s Disease. It does help a bit. Fits on easily and comfortably.</li>
    <li> Product does not provide comfort as represented. The silicone in this product has NO GIVE and is like a hard lump under your toes which only adds to your discomfort. I have other Gel Toe Crest Products that are SOFT and give you the relief you need. Keep shopping - there are plenty of these out there to pick from. I want to return these but they say they are not returnable so I am stuck with them.</li>
    <li> needed some thing for in shoes to aide in problem toe relief</li>
    <li> They were too large for me, but they were what I wanted, so gave them to neice who needed bigger ones..</li>
    <li> Got a pair of these for my Hammertoes. The loop is too stiff,which practically strangles your toe and the compound is too hard making them very uncomfortable. Can&#x27;t use them and don&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> I had a bunionectomy and my toe isn&#x27;t at 100%. These actually help when wearing wedges  again by providing a cushion under my toe.</li>
    <li> no problems, does the job</li>
    <li> good product.  Same device from footsmart leaked and lasted only 1 month, this doesnt leak and does not get deformed like footsmart product.</li>
    <li> Basically, bought and rated this based on mom&#x27;s report. She says they were exactly what she wanted, and better than some of the cheap types sold.</li>
    <li> They are for my husband and he thinks they work just fine.</li>
    <li> I have found the gel pads to be much better in support than the older style foam pads. These are very easy to clean after each wearing.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband and he is really impressed with how much relief he is getting from his hammer toes on his right foot. He no longer has discomfort from the middle joint rubbing against the top of his shoes and the pain of the toe pads rubbing on the shoes.  He just loves this product and thinks it will keep him from having to have the painful surgery.</li>
    <li> These silicone crests feel great on my feet and really have helped with my hammer toes.  I  will order more of the same when these all wear out.</li>
    <li> One set was perfect but another set with the same number had to be returned because it was made with a harder material. So I&#x27;m only giving five stars to one set.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the money and it didn&#x27;t solve my problem, so for me it was just money down the drain.</li>
    <li> Tried several products and this one is outstanding. Can wear all day with no discomfort. Easy to clean and re-use.</li>
    <li> For my size 9 foot, the &amp;#34;lump&amp;#34; of the pad was always uncomfortable, particularly under big toe, and loop was too tight around toe.</li>
    <li> This product works...&lt;br /&gt;it will hold your toe down the &amp;#34;long toe&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;and prevent overlap on the &amp;#34;big toe.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I give it three stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you bend your toes that underside&lt;br /&gt;hinge point is very tender and without bending the area is tender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base of this device and others like it rests in that area&lt;br /&gt;and while walking the pressure will cause some discomfort&lt;br /&gt;of course over time the tender hinge point will toughen up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the product works as described above.</li>
    <li> My original toe crest was thinner and more angularly shaped. I could not find that brand on line.  This one is doing the job but I have toe discomfort.  Thank you</li>
    <li> It did/does not help my foot problem.  It made it worse.  I put it on as directed and it felt llike walking on stones.  Don&#x27;t use as I couldn&#x27;t stand the pain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using my first one. They never wear out, just get a little tired.</li>
    <li> they were way much thicker then I thought they&#x27;d be. Very hard to wear them</li>
    <li> I like to walk and run and constantly suffer from different annoyances and pain in my feet and toes. Currently, I am in training for a 2 day breast cancer walk and am looking for something to help with a longer second toe that consistently bruises, peripheral neuropathy, mild hammertoes as well as occasional metatarsal pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These crests looked promising however, they weren&#x27;t so comfortable and I couldn&#x27;t wear them effectively.  The curvature of the crest bothers my toes when I have socks and shoes on and makes it uncomfortable walking.  I expect that it is just me, but I thought I would share my experience with this item.</li>
    <li> I had been using the cloth type and find it to be much better.  These tend to slide back when putting on you stocking and create some pain where the band goes over the toe.</li>
    <li> i rather have the one u could tight it up as much then we want the other one is best</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wear them very long. Not recommended wearing over 4 hours. So at work I have to take them off and then put them back on in about 30 mins.</li>
    <li> Too bulky to wear with footwear (can be worn overnight, but really doesn&#x27;t do anything for  hammer toes).&lt;br /&gt;A good product is Toe Loops Hammer Toe Wraps (sold by Ithaca Sports) or Profoot Toe Straight Hammertoe Wrap.</li>
    <li> the reinforced toe ring causes the pad to be too tight because it has no give and will not stretch with movement and my toes hurt in no time, and unfortunately I thought these were the same type I had previously ordered and ordered three for each foot. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I have been using silicone toe crests for reverse hammer toes for over a decade.  These are WAY to stiff, and therefore too uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> arrived early and was exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Good product. good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it  5 stars but I can&#x27;t quite go that far about a device for corns and hammertoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do not cure your hammertoes, but they put fill space under adjacent toes which keeps hammertoes from sneaking over there. I am talking about baby toes here, that bend inward at a right angle sort of.  Now, the top down hammertoes I have no experience with yet.  I see some developing and this thing is not preventing that. Hmmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work for either side, large or small.  I take a sharp knife and carve them to fit.  They are always too thick for my toesies anyways.  I have cut some so they are straight, and used them on the left side also.  That way the loop is not to tight.  Irritation from the LOOP is the only thing I can&#x27;t fix that way.  They sell leather coated things like this, but then use a cheap rubber type tie thing to connect to your toe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while I could not wear shoes due to corn on baby hammertoe, but now I can, YAY.</li>
    <li> I need to clarify my last review - The gel was difficult for my husband to place on his hammer toe.&lt;br /&gt;Please clarify my previous review. I just received an e-mail to change the wording.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is sufficient, thank</li>
    <li> Thought that this was  silly idea, but willing to try anything for hammer toes and resulting calusses. It worked great, After getting used to it, I wear everyday and it has resulted in my toes slowly straightening and the calusses on the tops of the hammer toes have gone away. I sometimes walk 10 to 15 miles a day and no problems. Strange idea, but the best thing I have ever tried! Thanks You for this product!!</li>
    <li> Used to order these from Foot Smart but they changed the type of hammer toe crest they offer. Searched on line for this type and was happy to find them, ordered several and hope they continue to offer them.  Very comfortable and helpful for those with hammer toes, have used for two or three years now and it has really helped with the hammer toe problem.</li>
    <li> Problem I have with hammer toes (as a result of a broken heel) is the pressure on the tips of my toes when walking causes the nails to turn blue and the toes to hurt.  This device keeps the toes elevated just enough to relieve the pressure on the tips when walking.</li>
