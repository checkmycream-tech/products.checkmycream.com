<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this hoping to have a reliable, well made product. No such luck. And customer &amp;#34;care&amp;#34; is nonexistent. They dont care if you spend over 110 bucks on a toothbrush and it doesn&#x27;t last. Better products out there for this price. Oh but wait, they did offer me 15% off my next purchase. Cluelessness confirmed. what a joke. Sonidon&#x27;t Care.</li>
    <li> made a big difference when I had my check up at the denist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Sonicare and I absolutely love it!  I went a little over a month when my last one died and was using a traditional brush because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money and my teeth just never felt clean.  I used it the day it came in the mail and I felt like I had just left the dentist&#x27;s office from a cleaning.  I will not go without ever again.  It is worth the money and I had wonderful dental checkups while using the 1st one but after not using it for a month, got reports of increased tartar buildup and gum sensitivity.  This is the best money you can spend, especially with the research now correlating heart and other health issues with oral care.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Felt weird at first with the intense vibrations if it touched my lip, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier now with how clean my teeth are. It&#x27;s like going to the dentist every day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Sonicare, so it&#x27;s awesome, but I was expecting three speeds. I had ordered three other healthy whites last year for my husband kids and I that come in three speeds: regular, sensitive and white. We had our kids sharing a base with their own heads then decided to just order another brush because of fighting. This brush is blue with the two speeds: regular and white and works fine.</li>
    <li> very happy with this product - dentist recommended it highly and if certainly seems to work great.  Will continue to use it and replace it when necessary</li>
    <li> Love It...The old sonic I used periodically.  This one is used twice a day.  Would recommend, and yes, my teeth seem to be cleaner...Dentist appointment this Friday....will learn more!.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement of my old Sonicare which had seen better days.  I expect this one will last even longer.</li>
    <li> I had a Sonicare toothbrush for many years and left my charger in a hotel on vacation. I decided I wanted a new one anyway and this one is amazing. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a philips sonic toothbrush for years. I usually buy the cheaper $40 models and replace them every two years. I thought I would try this more expensive model to see if there was/is a real difference.....there is. The head is smaller on this unit which allows to get to the back molars much better than the cheaper models. This model seems to have more power and the battery lasts much longer on this one also. Definately worth paying the extra for this one if you are using a sonic toothbrush. Update: I have now had this almost 4 years and this thing is still great. Have just replaced brush ends once a year or so. Battery and power still excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare electric toothbrush for many years. I am completely happy with this one too. Keeps my teeth &amp; gums healthy.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush in a long time. Now, I am hooked! this product is GREAT! definitely worth the money. narrow shape gets in tricky spots too.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush has my teeth feeling so clean and refreshing.  I am glad I decided to purchase this product; I will recommend this product to other customers.</li>
    <li> This is the second Sonicare I have had. The first gave up the ghost after about eight years and would not charge. I was very pleased with it.  I have learned not to form early opinions about electronic products so my opinions are somewhat reserved given I have had this for less than a month. My initial impression was that unlike it&#x27;s predecessor which was one of the very early Sonicare models, this one seems very flimsy.  However, it does everything my original did which was just the basics.  If this one is still performing in 3-4 years, I would add the fifth star.</li>
    <li> Recommended by two dentists, an orthodontist, and a periodontist over a period of several years.  Glad I finally bought it!</li>
    <li> My previous electronic toothbrush was a Sonicare E-Series and I never liked how the brush accumulated all this gunk between the head and base.  It was impossible to keep clean.  My battery on the E-series died out and I decided to replace it with the Sonicare 710.  I like the 710 better for several reasons.  The toothbrush itself is less bulky, lighter and easier to hold.  It also seems to be less noisy.  In addition the head is easy to install (it snaps on) and it is very easy to clean between the head and base. The toothbrush comes with a \\&quot;clean and white\\&quot; feature which provides you with an extra 30 seconds to concentrate on the visible part of your front teeth.  The one (minor) negative is that the charger does not include space to wrap the extra cord so if you like to keep the charger on your counter you will have a long cord that is always in the way. Fortunately the battery only needs to be charged every few weeks, so I keep my charger stored away until needed. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase an electronic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help me step up my oral hygiene routine. I first purchased a water pik flosser from Amazon despite the negative reviews. Well they were right...the product probably worked but made too much of a mess. On the advice of my dental hygienist I bought this toothbrush. I immediately noticed a difference in how clean my teeth looked and felt, and within a few days noticed increased whiteness too. I am hooked on this toothbrush! When I was reading the product description, I thought the built in timer seemed unneccessary, but it really is one of it&#x27;s best features. It made me realize that I probably never brushed for 2 minutes before...it seemed like a long time at first. The 30 second whitening phase at the end is also great...I think it does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitant to buy this, don&#x27;t be! I won&#x27;t know until my next check-up, but am willing to bet that this toothbrush will pay for itself in the saving of dental co-pays at that visit. I&#x27;m just sorry that I didn&#x27;t have this 20 years ago.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I have ever used. Wish that I had purchased this toothbrush years ago. Teeth are so clean, white and sparkly. Better than getting cleaned at the dentist.</li>
    <li> (1)It started suddenly in 5 am, and it was really horrible.&lt;br /&gt;(2)The toothbrush can&#x27;t be stopped by pressing the switch button.&lt;br /&gt;(3)It stopped until the battery is flat.&lt;br /&gt;(4)It is not rechargable any more.</li>
    <li> I was doing some research between getting a Sonicare and an Oral-B. I went with the Sonicare simply because it had more positive reviews. I&#x27;ve never tried an Oral-B, but I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Sonicare, so the vibration is super ticklish at first. You get used to it within a couple days, though. The reason I got this specific model was mostly for the &amp;#34;quad&amp;#34; feature - where it lets you know when to switch a quadrant of your teeth every 30 seconds. This feature sounds simple, but is actually ridiculously awesome. It makes sure you are actually brushing your entire mouth, rather than just whatever part you keep the toothbrush on.</li>
    <li> If you have thin gums, like I do, this toothbrush is terrible for gum recession.  I was brushing too aggressively with this product for years, and had to get gum surgery.  This toothbrush does not have a sensitive enough setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is pretty good, however.  This product is not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I gave this tooth brush to my girl friend as a gift, she loves it, and I use it when I visit her, it is a great product!</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare elite died after about eight years, the battery just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and no longer really cleaned my teeth good.  I picked this up as a basic no frills replacement. This thing works great and does an amazing job cleaning.  My dentist noticed the next time I went in, she immediately asked &amp;#34;did you get a new toothbrush?&amp;#34;  Why yes I did, and I love it!  My girlfriend has the diamond, but I didn&#x27;t really see the need in spending three times as much to do the same job.</li>
    <li> very nice after use for a few days ,good quality and works quiet, better if the holder recharger is a wall type</li>
    <li> The final judgment of this product will come from my dentist...but it appears my gums are bleeding less, and my teeth feel a lot smoother (no tartar feeling).</li>
    <li> I have used a sonicare toothbrush for many years. One aspect  I like about this model is that the brush head is easier to clean than was the last which died. I suspect the life expectancy of these power packs could be longer.</li>
    <li> Good for clean. However, the white and clean model is not as good as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used already for around 1 month. Standard brush. (Not small one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is better than my previous Oral B brush. But just a little better. Not very obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For White and clean model, no big difference to the Clean only model.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It really makes my teeth clean.  I am not builing up tartar behind my bottom teeth which I usually have a problem with.</li>
    <li> Previously, we had the Essence, but ended up disliking it for a few reasons. The Essence brush heads had to be screwed on and off and underneath would collect moisture and sometimes noticed a black residue inside. Then we had to soak them in bleach-water to maintain hygiene. It became a nuisance. The other reason I didn&#x27;t like the Essence, was because the handle is smooth plastic and very slippery when wet. This made it difficult to hold onto and then difficult to dry and then unscrew the brush head. The handle was also very large diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our new Healthy White solved all of those issues. It has a slimmer handle with rubber grips (no slippage). The brush heads pop on and off, so no difficulty with unscrewing or dealing with the hygiene problem. So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recommend the ProResults brush heads (didn&#x27;t care for the HydroClean due to the fact there are fewer bristles). This is an investment in dental and gum health and very much worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional remark, we previously also had an Oral B electric (oscillating round head), and that worked well for many years. After menopause, I noticed my gums were a bit more tender due to the abrasiveness, and decided to try the SoniCare. The SoniCare does not irritate my gums at all.</li>
    <li> I recievd this toothbrush as a gift, and loved it so much I bought it as a gift for my mom. Now, she is raving about it as much I did. It honestly did whiten my teeth. It&#x27;s truly a dentist-quality clean with every brushing. Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found. Just buy it :)</li>
    <li> I just purchased my Sonicare 700 series toothbrush about a week ago at the recommendation of my hygenist. I was diagnosed with preidontal disease, and after the teeth scaling and deep cleaning, I was encouraged to change my toothbrush (I had the Oral B flossing action). One of the main reasons I was told to switch brushes is due to the oxygenation action of the Sonicare, which kills off the anaerobic bacteria that contribute to the peridontal disease.  After using the Sonicare for the first time, my Braun toothbrush felt like a toy... My teeth are CLEAN and feel terrific, and I am not noticing the tartar buildup on my lower front teeth as I normally would have had at this time already. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth!!!  WELL WORTH THE MONEY you will spend to preserve your dental health.</li>
    <li> Second purchase of a Sonicare and my first one died out a little more than a year with the battery. It gave great results, so I figured it was worth another try and this time the focus on the White model.  very happy so far and must say a little harder on the teeth, but think may be a little whiter results.  Satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> My original sonicare is still running strong but apparently the heads for that design are no longer available. Just as well. Prompted me to upgrade to the HealthyWhite design. Much better! Coupons included from the manufacturer made a pack of three extra heads 5.00 cheaper..........a little bonus. More important are my clean white teeth and no cavities in 10 years!! I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; brush:-)</li>
    <li> I was initially drawn to this product by others&#x27; reviews stating that it could make your teeth whiter.  I have only been using it a couple of weeks so perphaps I need more time since it hasn&#x27;t been the case for me.  However, in fairness to the product, I only use it at night.  During the day, I use an old-fashioned non-electric toothbrush in the interest of saving time.  NOTE:  if you have sensitive gums, this product is definitely not for you.  The toothbrush is a lot stiffer than the older version I used.  But I like that the brush itself is smaller and easily reaches way into the back of my mouth so that my molars are now as clean as my front teeth.</li>
    <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for over 15 years. This is my favorite! Much, much better than the other two. I like the slim style, the smaller brush heads, and the whitening effect on my teeth. Put Tom&#x27;s Wholecare toothpaste on the brush, and my teeth feel like I just had a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
    <li> Trying to get in better dental hygiene habits, and bought one for my husband and myself. We can&#x27;t stop  brushing our teeth! 2...3 times a day! The look of my teeth...but especially my gums...has already improved just after using it for 48 hours. I flossed after using it...and there was nothing to floss! No plaque, nada! Super buy at a super price...I love Amazon! :)</li>
    <li> If I can&#x27;t brush with this toothbrush I don&#x27;t want to brush at all. This is the best invention since soap.</li>
    <li> I love this electronic toothbrush! It works wonders on my teeth and I haven&#x27;t gotten any cavities since I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush. I highly recommend purchasing this toothbrush to everyone.</li>
    <li> I got a great deal on this from Amazon. Regularly I would expect to pay $20-$30 more than I did for this product. Sonicare came in factory packaging and is in perfect condition. I love this toothbrush because it has an incredible battery life (over ten days for me) and it works wonders. The replacement heads are a little bit expensive (Like $25 for three) and my head did not last for three months, I will have to replace it more often than recommended.</li>
    <li> When our old Sonicares stopped working after 4 years, I knew I wanted to get another Sonicare. Even though slightly more expensive, we decided to go with a newer model because the older versions get gunky at the base and under the toothbrush head. Plus, the replacement heads for the newer models are more inexpensive. Therefore, I was left to try to decide between the Flexcare and the HealthyWhite. I went with the 3-mode healthywhite and wished I&#x27;d picked the Flexcare. I wish I had known that HealthyWhite just adds 30 seconds to brush time, to let you focus on your front teeth. It doesn&#x27;t change the way it brushes your teeth for that additional 30 seconds.     Pros: 1. Brush head snaps on and is much less gunky than older models        2. Lightweight handle        3. Sensitive mode is nice after dental work        4. Cleans teeth really well--all sonicare models are amazing at cleaning your teeth, even between teeth        5. The three mode HealthyWhite brush comes with a small head for focusing on one tooth at a time like at the dentist&#x27;s            office, and a place on the base to hold it. It looks very compact and neat on the sink.        6. Quad-pacing makes sure you evenly time where you brush your teeth. I include the tops of my teeth with each section,            but I&#x27;ve always wished it including time for them in the quad-pacing. But I wouldn&#x27;t want a Sonicare that didn&#x27;t            offer any pacing. I&#x27;ve gotten used to the luxury.        7. Automatic shut off after 2minutes (and 30 seconds if using HealthyWhite mode). I do wish it were slightly longer.            Sometimes I do the 2-min 30second cycle twice, I think 3 minutes would be the perfect amount. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it if it            didn&#x27;t time you! I like to know I&#x27;m brushing long enough.        8. You can opt-out of the gradual increase in power which is nice if you&#x27;ve already been using a sonicare. But I like it            for convincing other family members they should be using one!        9. Rechargable and battery lasts for weekend trips without carting the charger with me! Even with me using it more than            2min 30 seconds every time.      Cons: 1.\\&quot;Healthywhite\\&quot; option doesn&#x27;t really do anything but give you 30 seconds longer to brush your teeth        2. You have to press the button 3 times to get to the healthywhite options every time you turn on the toothbrush. It            starts in regular clean mode, press again for sensitive and a third time for healthywhite. It would be nice if it            could start in the longer mode automatically/remember your preference.    If I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d buy the Flexcare. I feel like the \\&quot;healthywhite\\&quot; is just a gimmick. The Flexcare is more attractive/modern looking, has all of the \\&quot;pros\\&quot; of the Healthywhite, offers longer timing, and a sanitizer for not much more money.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for about two months and have had no problems with it.  I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare brush, and both times I had the same bizarre issue. About a year into using it, it started turning on RANDOMLY. Needless to say, this is kind of horrifying--like it has a mind of its own. I was going to wait it out and see if they would repair it under warranty, but the noise was driving me so crazy (and scaring the guinea pigs) that I took apart the brush. This happened with both brushes. It&#x27;s uncanny.    I did really like the brush while it worked. But, in the end, I found my little Preserve toothbrush to be much less fancy and more reliable. And about 1/10th as expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush when my almost 10-year-old Sonicare died.  I had used whitening kits and they hadn&#x27;t worked so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  It took about a month of brushing twice a day with whitening toothpaste, but the results were amazing!  My teeth are so white that a co-worker asked me if I had had them professionally whitened!  I highly recommend this model of the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The main reason I purchased this particular item was because it is dual voltage and I travel a lot. It works great, and very happy with it :)</li>
    <li> I bought this R710 Phillips HealthyWhite toothbrush less than 2 years ago.  Recently, the metal prong that you place the brush head on became detached from the charger. It was only held in place by the rubber seal. We were able to re-insert the prong, but it would detach again when you removed the brush head from the charger.  Now, the rubber seal that holds the metal prong to the charger has now split open and as a result, it is now totally broken.  I am so upset that I spent so much money ($112) on this product and then have it last less than 2 years!      We were very careful using this product, but nonetheless very disappointed with its durability even with careful use.      It does clean your teeth well, but the design is flawed!  If you buy this product be sure to register it under the warranty.  I regretfully did not, but I don&#x27;t think it would have mattered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of years now, and it still holds its charge very well - I sometimes go for a couple of weeks without re-charging. Previous electric brushes I&#x27;ve owned all suffered from batteries that would no longer maintain their charge after a while.    And oh yes, the dentist noticed right away when I started using it!  Just don&#x27;t whack your teeth with the back of the brush...that thing *really* vibrates.    All in all I think this is an excellent electric toothbrush. And here is a tip - don&#x27;t throw away your old worn out brush heads; use them to clean around the base of faucets etc. - the scale and grime come right off. Don&#x27;t mix your brushes though :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this HealthyWhite brush after my Elite stopped working. This brush is a good upgrade over the Elite as it is thinner, better build quality, and easier to hold. What I like most is the new head that is very easy to clean after every brushing so you are more likely to keep it in better condition. I cannot tell whether there is any cleaning improvement over the Elite but I appreciate the quadrant timer that helps me control my brushing. This loses a star because it did not come with a travelling case.</li>
    <li> it is a great product. cleans very well.  however, i didn&#x27;t get receipt together with my order. how could i ask for a receipt?  thanks,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to get this toothbrush for a while, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money since it seemed to be too-good-to-be-true.  The first time I used this toothbrush I was blown away.  It did exactly as advertised, dentist clean everyday!  The only set-back I can think of, is the vibration.  It freaked me out the first couple of times that I used it, but I got used to it pretty quickly, especially since it did such a good job on my teeth.  I recommend this item to everyone, definitely a must have!</li>
    <li> After much research and the long coveting of my boyfriend&#x27;s Sonicare, I decided to purchase the Heathy White.  I have been incredibly pleased with the results.  It&#x27;s a great little toothbrush with regard to size and easily travels..and it&#x27;s a powerhouse of a brush on the teeth.  I can&#x27;t believe how much I like using it, as I thought two minutes would seem like ages.  Highly recommend..and was pleased with my service also.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for an older sonicare that stopped working. I read numerious reviews on both sonic care and oral b. In the end, I wanted a solid brush that wouldn&#x27;t have the problems with moisture collecting under the cap like my previous brush (old e series). I do not need many features - and this one is perfect. I have found I can use it twice a day for 2 weeks without haven&#x27;t to recharge. This cleans much better than the older model - my teeth feel smooth and clean. I have not noticed much difference with the \\&quot;clean and white&#x27; cycle, that is supposed to help remove stains.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. My wife and I have been using it for more than a month now and we are very satisfied with this product. Teeth feel so clean after you brush with Sonicare HealthyWhite. I would highly recommed this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years.  Finally my old one needed to be replaced.  Battery started dying.  This new HealthyWhite Power toothbrush works like a champ, and I am very pleased with it.  The power on this device seems to be much better than my old one.</li>
    <li> I never realized you could get that dentist level of clean at home until I tried the Philips Sonicare. This is a terrific tool to have for daily use. It has a 30 second timer for each section of your teeth for a full two minutes of cleaning. This toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling super clean and your breath fresher. I can&#x27;t see me ever going back to manual brushing!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing toothbrush and after using it for a couple months now, I will never go back to standard toothbrushes.  My teeth feel cleaner, I don&#x27;t have to worry about how long I&#x27;m brushing b/c the timer is great (has two settings, clean which has 4-30 second intervals and clean &amp; white which has 4-30 second intervals &amp; 2-15 second intervals), and it&#x27;s easy to use.    I really like the travel charger as well b/c it&#x27;s small, doesn&#x27;t take up much room, and can be used just about anywhere you travel to if you have an adapter for the different types of endings for different countries.    I know the brush heads can get a little expensive, but I&#x27;ve actually found a great deal at Costco for this model when there is a coupon (I think it&#x27;s 7 brush heads for about $36 with the coupon, which is seasonal but I&#x27;ve seen them go on sale for than once in a year).  Costco also has pretty great deals on the toothbrushes themselves when they have coupons, better even than Amazon.  People say that the battery doesn&#x27;t last and maybe I haven&#x27;t had mine long enough, but I&#x27;ve only charged it maybe 3 times max in the past couple months.  I think if you take proper care of your battery and don&#x27;t leave it on the charger constantly, then your battery will last longer.  The toothbrush indicates in various ways (solid light, blinking light) the battery level you currently have.  I would definitely recommend reading the instruction booklet before use b/c it has recommendations for care &amp; use.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush and most sonicare toothbrushes don&#x27;t really last longer than three years without the on/off switch starting to malfunction!  I have owned three in the last 10 years and no more!!!  Three strikes and they are out.  Trust me if your toothbrush starts to malfunction after the warranty, they will do nothing to help you.  I cannot afford to spend over $100 every 2 or 3 years for a new Sonicare!  If I had written a review when I first bought the toothbrush it would have been a glowing review, but now as an experienced user of Sonicare, I say stay away from their products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 2 of these electric toothbrushes and 1 of another model. All three failed after a year of use. When my first one broke because it would no longer brush anymore, I thought it was the battery. I charged it for a day and it still did not function properly. I figured it was a fluke. Then I ordered another one and it happened again. I ordered a different model and the same thing happened. I finally realized that since I travel a lot, I have to remove the brush head from the unit. After repeated removal and installation, I damaged the unit head that attaches to the toothbrush. I figure this is a flaw in the design. The older models where you screw down the brush head was much better and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note... On one of my units, the brush would be on the charger and mysteriously turn on by itself. At one point I had to put the toothbrush downstairs because the vibration annoyed my wife. I will never spend money on this product again.</li>
    <li> The first one of these I purchased was great...very strong and powerful...until it completely died about a month in. I called Sonicare, and they immediately sent me a new one. It started off great like the first one. Then about a year in, I could notice the power diminished greatly. About 1 week after the 2 year warranty expired, this replacement toothbrush completely died. I had felt it slowly losing power until it eventually died. Perhaps I just haven&#x27;t had good luck, but it looks like others have had this issue as well. I can&#x27;t vouch for any Oral B rechargeable brushes, but I&#x27;m giving up on Sonicare.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> I bought the SonicareR710 on the advice of my dentist for receding gums. I have yet to be seen by my dentist since using the product but I can definitely say that my teeth feel as clean as when cleaned by a dental hygienist !</li>
    <li> This update on the earlier Sonicare toothbrush is a worthy successor. The power handle and its recharging base are more compact, making a convenient fit in medicine cabinets or on counter tops. The HealthyWhite feature is a shift in vibration pattern that is refreshing, if nothing else. The feature results in a slightly longer brushing cycle, which is a good thing.    The base wrap around device is not an attractive solution to excessive cord length. The power cord remains thicker than it probably needs to be. It would be nice if the cord was detachable and available in varying lengths. One could then order the desired length. Alternatively, the charging base could be offered with different built in cord lengths. In my location, six or eight inches would be ideal so the long cord is a problematic wad on the counter.</li>
    <li> I got this brush as a replacement for my previous Sonicare which was under warranty.  The original had the old style heads, so even though Philips sent me a new brush, they still \\&quot;won\\&quot; because I had to buy new brush heads, which aren&#x27;t cheap.    After less than 2 years, this one has now broken, but my warranty is relative to the original purchase, not the age of this brush.  They sent me a lame coupon and that&#x27;s it.      I def. have had better dentists visits using Sonicare than I ever did without, but it&#x27;s pretty annoying to have to shell out $100 every other year for a brush plus the costs of brush heads.  Customer support claims the lifetime of their brushes is 3-5 years.  As if.</li>
    <li> The batteries on my old Sonicare Elite (E-series) died on me, so I decided to get a new one.  The R710 has several incremental upgrades which are worth the difference in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, like the FlexCare line, it uses the ProResults head.  This alone is worth the price difference.  They snap in easily, they cost less, and the handle traps much less gunk than before.  Sold.  I&#x27;m still waiting to see how long they last; my guess is about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the regular cleaning mode, the R710 has a second mode designed to scrub away stains.  It&#x27;s selected by pushing the power button twice.  In this mode, the 5th (last) interval of the normal cycle is pulsed in a way that&#x27;s supposed to break up stains on your visible teeth.  Note that after this interval, the brush stops.  If you still want to brush your tongue or concentrate on hard-to-reach areas, you&#x27;ll have to push the power button again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The R710 now also comes with a Li-ion battery, which noticeably decreases the weight and increases the battery life.  The charger is about half the size of the Elite&#x27;s, but it doesn&#x27;t have anywhere to wrap the cord like the deluxe charger on the Flexcare.  It comes with an (optional) snap-on plate that holds two extra heads.  The charge indicator is a simple LED.  If it&#x27;s blinking, it&#x27;s below 50%; if it&#x27;s solid, then it&#x27;s above.  Maybe not as informative or fun to watch as the Elite or FlexCare, but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you want a good basic Sonicare, this is the one to get.  It has all the great redesigned features of the FlexCare but less of the (IMO gimmicky) extra routines and modes.  If you have sensitive teeth, check out the R732.  For an extra $20, it also comes with a few extra accessories like a case and deluxe charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (1/5/2011): My Sonicare failed a few days before the 2-year warranty expired. It powered on, but the action gradually weakened over a week, until the brush head no longer moved at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following a short call, Philips promptly sent out a new HX6730 handle along with a return mailer for the defective unit. Great support, as long as you&#x27;re within the warranty period.</li>
    <li> This was my first Sonicare Toothbrush that I bought after reading some of some of the positive reviews here.  I was replacing an old Braun that I had for over 10 years.  This one seems to have more and faster movements of the brush and it does a better job of cleaning my teeth.  You know that feeling after you come out of the dentist&#x27;s office for a cleaning where your teeth have that polished, smooth feeling when you run your tongue over them?  Well, even after the first time using this toothbrush my teeth felt that way.  My old toothbrush never did that.  After using it for a few weeks my teeth looked whiter to me.  Now I never did a real test, like brushing one half with this toothbrush and one half with the old, but when I look at myself in the mirror, I can see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the timer thingy on this toothbrush.  I thought it would be like a bell or a beep, but it&#x27;s more like a little pause after each of four 30 second segments.  So you do each area of your mouth for 30 seconds and then if you want to do the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; segment, you push the bottom button and it&#x27;ll time those segments.  This part is a different type of vibration or movement that is supposed to do an even better job of polishing your teeth.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this part or just spending enough time on each section, but it works. My teeth feel cleaner and look whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I noticed with this toothbrush is that my gums don&#x27;t bleed when brushing my teeth anymore.  I&#x27;ve had that problem for probably the last 30 years, whether I used my old Braun electric toothbrush or whether I brushed my teeth by hand.  After the first couple days with this toothbrush it just stopped.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the texture of the brush or if it&#x27;s just contributes to the health of my gums, but it&#x27;s a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is very easy to clean and the brushes snap on and off very easily.  It&#x27;s lightweight which makes it easy to use and it&#x27;s reasonably quiet for a power toothbrush.  I&#x27;m completely sold on this brand.  When I need to replace it at some point, it will be with another Philips Sonicare product.  Two thumbs up!quiet for a power toothbrush.  I&#x27;m completely sold on this brand.  When I need to replace it at some point, it will be with another Philips Sonicare product.  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  My old sonicare batteries wouldn&#x27;t take a charge any more.  This new one is just fantastic.  Just enough bells, don&#x27;t need a degree in programming to make it work.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush (I forget the other model... about 2 years old).  My switch to the last one made a major difference in reversing some gum shrinkage, so I&#x27;m a fan for life.  This one is slimmer, very easy to use, works great.  No idea where the earlier comment about the head coming of came from... seems very sold to me.</li>
    <li> I have one of this model for myself and have given these as gifts. We&#x27;re just now discovering that oral hygiene is critically tied to your overall health, particularly cardiovascular health, so as a health professional, I feel really strongly about investing in a good toothbrush. Seriously, just PubMed search this and read the journal articles for yourself. And the studies show that Sonicare hands down is the best toothbrush. The clean you feel after using this brush is unbelievable, IMO. The new head design stays cleaner and is easier to use/manage than the previous screw on design. All the extra fru fru in the expensive version is not worth it (the timer/pacer thing and the UV lamp). Amazon has an awesome price. Phillips customer service is second to none. I had an older model Sonicare that broke after a year unexpectedly (the peroxide from my toothpaste degraded a rubber joint) and Phillips express shipped a brand new brush, no questions asked. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I cannot comment on the life of this brush, as we&#x27;ve only had it for two weeks.     The reason I&#x27;m reviewing it this early, is that we have all returned from the dentist, and even after having had the brush for such a short time, the reviews were staggering.     We picked the brush up the night before our childrens&#x27; appointments, and after using the brush just twice the dentist was so impressed with their improved dental habits that it was mind-numbing. Since one of our children is anything but diligent at getting every tooth brushed exactly right... and wasn&#x27;t even terribly good at remembering to brush every day, this was amazing.     I had my own dental appointment this week, after having used the brush for ten days. I&#x27;m one of those people blessed with naturally cavity-resistant teeth, but extremely sensitive gums. They have always swelled up &amp; bled if I brushed too hard or flossed at ALL, and they would hurt for days after a simple dental exam. At my own exam, my gums were noticeably healthier, did NOT bleed much at all, and they barely hurt by the time I&#x27;d returned home. This is absolutely amazing to me, as I have never had so little discomfort from a dental visit! But what was truly incredible was that they actually said my teeth were noticeably WHITER! Sure I bought the brush to help whiten my teeth as I am a tea-drinker &amp; have permanent staining... but to notice my teeth whitening in less than a month? Wow!     Truly, this brush has gone above &amp; beyond my wildest hopes. My \\&quot;problem brusher\\&quot; is now brushing their teeth every morning without my needing to nag them, while my \\&quot;diligent brusher\\&quot; is able to brush their teeth to their hearts-content and feels as if their teeth are really getting clean enough to satisfy them. And I am actually managing to brush away decades of teastains... AND for the first time in my life my gums don&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 3 kids - it&#x27;s perfect!  3 separate heads, one for each, plus I have one, and know that my checkups are actually better with one of these.  A bit pricey at first, but get the 3 packs for $27 at target, etc.- much better than 1 for $17!  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> My old-style Sonic toothbrush lasted me for 12 years and was still working great until I could no longer find replacement heads to purchase for it. I begrudged having to abondon it and purchase a replacement for this reason. I chose the R710 because it was the cheapest model that did not run on batteries. I didn&#x27;t expect anything to work better than my old Sonic, but it does so much better that I purchased another one for my wife. I don&#x27;t even use the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; mode, yet I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the results I get. I just hope it lasts as long as my old model Sonic! My only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the replacement heads are still overpriced.</li>
    <li> When you first use this toothbrush, beware, toothpaste will go everywhere, it takes some time to learn how to keep from splattering toothpaste all over the mirror and walls. But once you have mastered how to use it, your teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
    <li> I hate it, primarily due to the motion and speed of the brush, which is extremely fast, almost like a vibrator that tickles your gums and teeth.  Makes it difficult to use!</li>
    <li> We have had Sonicare for years, but the older model has finally given up.  So, we purchased this one and think it is worth the price you pay.    The brushes are a bit difficult to place on the holder, but works fine....Like the sanitizer feature, but really do not know if it is doing the job.  I   am to assume so.....Lots of ways to brush....I would highly recommend this to others interested in an electronic toothbrush.  Your teeth do feel  much cleaner.</li>
    <li> You really get the \\&quot;just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist\\&quot; feeling.  I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and this is by far the best.  It really does remove coffee stains.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare products are excellent. What is missing is good identification and packaging. My Healthy Bright has no identification as to what it is.  As a result ordering new brushes becomes a game of squinty eyes and hopeful guesses. The packaging of repacemnent brushes is such that when you open the package all three brushes and rings are out.  But I only wanted one brush! Sometimes little things can make a big difference.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a significant improvement over the older Elite models. It is trimmer, lighter, and the brush head attachments are a better design. With the Elite model, I had trouble with moisture and mold building up in the hole where the head screws into the handle. It isn&#x27;t even possible to have that problem with this new design. An added bonus with the new design is that since the brush head is simpler, it costs significantly less to replace.</li>
    <li> Excellent product....this is my third one of this exact type the other two die out after running for aprox. 18 months per toothbrush..my teeth are white and gorgeous...as I brush 2x no matter what and always use for the full 2 minutes...</li>
    <li> My dentist originally told me to steer clear of the rotating brushes to clean your teeth, not much more than taking sandpaper to your teeth. I have since switched dentists, and this gadget had come recommended by many friends, as well as my new dentist. It vibrates the head of the brush at a super high rate of speed. Gone are the days of moving the toothbrush back and forth over your teeth. Simply put on toothpaste, put in mouth, and turn on. Place the head on your teeth and work however you see fit. Every 30 seconds, the tone changes, and you change quadrants in your mouth. This is my one complaint, I&#x27;d like to see variable timed (longer) intervals. After two minutes, or 2:30 if you chose the whitening mode, the brush shuts off. Almost four months after having been to the dentist, my teeth still have that super slick clean feeling, I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an electric sonic toothbrush this is the one to get. It has the timer which is very convenient and it has a whitening mode too for your front teeth. I can tell a big difference with the cleaniness of my teeth after using this toothbrush. I recommend 100%!!!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It&#x27;s lightweight and does a good job of brushing my teeth for me. I like the 30 second timers too, because I usually don&#x27;t go all the way to 2 minutes, but I know at least I&#x27;ve gone long enough.</li>
    <li> I purchase this toothbrush in August 2010 and by Thanksgiving 2010 the battery was dead.  On these toothbrushes the battery can not be replaced so you have to replace the entire brush.  This is the 3rd Phillips Sonicare toothbrush that I have had.  The first one lasted a few years.  The second one lasted 2 years and now this one just 6 months.  I like the brush, but don&#x27;t want to have to buy a new one this frequently......</li>
    <li> I loved my old Sonicare toothbrush and it lasted for almost 10 years. When it bit the dust, I purchased this one in 2011. I loved it, although my teeth never felt quite as clean as my old one. Now, only 3 years later, the battery is dead, dead, dead. Compared to my older model that worked fabulously for 10 years, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a great value.     I called customer service and they agreed, and sent a replacement model, as this one is no longer manufactured. The one they sent is all white and has the added \\&quot;sensitivity\\&quot; mode. Philips Sonicare customer support is a dream to work with. They answer fairly quickly (on hold less than 5 minutes), cheerful &amp; knowledgeable (called twice), and the replacement came quickly.     Everyone who uses Sonicare toothbrushes know there&#x27;s no going back, so I&#x27;m very thankful to have a working replacement now. Thanks Sonicare, my teeth have really been missing this brush! :-)</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I brushed my teeth for 10 minutes straight. When I was done they were smoother and cleaner feeling then when I come back from a professional cleaning. My teeth are always so clean now, I&#x27;m spoiled. Also my teeth are noticeably whiter than before. Kind of pricey for a tooth brush, but considering the cost of dental work, I&#x27;m sure this will pay for itself many times over.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a great improvement on the older models. My favorite new feature are the brush heads, which cost less to replace than the older model and don&#x27;t allow water inside where it could develop mold. The HealthyWhite seems to have all the features that actually matter (the extra whitening setting, timer) and is significantly cheaper than some of the other Sonicare models that, in my opinion, merely add gimmicky features. I have had the product for just over a month.</li>
    <li> Sure, you would expect a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrush to vibrate, but actually it need only twist the brush.  I get the impression the stem of the brush wobbles transversely, judging from the effect when it touches a tooth.  If you can keep it from touching your teeth, it&#x27;s just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 months later:&lt;br /&gt;Well... It&#x27;s just fine for ten months.  Then it starts itself and runs the battery down.  This self-starting problem is pandemic among electric toothbrushes; I&#x27;ve read the same complaint for another brand.  Presumably, the toothbrushes are made by one outfit, and branded by resellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you imagine how annoying it is to be awakened at 3 am by \\&quot;Nnxzzgnxzgngz... Nnxzzgnxzgngz-Nnxzzgnxzgngz\\&quot; coming from your bathroom?</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using a regular toothbrush for the longest until i switched to Sonicare. I love the feeling how my tooth feels after brushing it. battery life is great, cleaning is very easy. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I have moved up from the Sonicare Elite.  They are both quite competent toothbrushes and I&#x27;d recommend either.  I feel that the Healthy White has a slight edge on power and the shape of the brush is also an improvement.  Also, the brush head is less expensive to manufacture than the Elite head and should be less expensive than it is.  It is still less expensive than the Elite, which contains 2 rare earth magnets in each head.  The Healthy White head does not.  I really think that Philips should pass along this savings.  I love both items, but I currently use the Healthy White.</li>
    <li> Been using it for months and it works very good.  Recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> The battery died after only using it for two months.  It won&#x27;t recharge or turn on anymore.  The warranty is only good for a month.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  I&#x27;ve had other Sonicare products that have lasted over two years, but this one is no good.</li>
    <li> This Sonicare Healthywhite was great for the first three months or so. It worked better than my previous Advance, which I&#x27;d had for about 5 years. Then one day, the battery started lasting less and less for about a month until it stopped charging altogether. Apparently, this is quite normal and Philips suggested I buy a new charger for $30 even though I&#x27;d only had the unit 3 months. Really disappointed with the quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve alway&#x27;s used Sonicare...it&#x27;s the perfect toothbrush and worth the money.  I love this new version because you don&#x27;t have to deal with the gunk that would build up in the older sonicares.</li>
    <li> I floss my teeth maybe 3 times year (if that) and 90% of the time I only brush once a day - in the past, my bad habits have resulted in a cavity or two every time I visited the dentist.    Four years ago, I changed one thing and one thing only about the way I take care of my teeth and that was to get a Sonicare. I still never floss and still only brush once a day. I have not had a cavity since making the switch. My teeth are also whiter and my mouth feels clean.    As far as this Sonicare vs the other models by Sonicare. I had the most expensive model for awhile before I lost it, and honestly, the bells and whistles of the more expensive models are pretty useless. This version is just as effective and costs significantly less.</li>
    <li> I was not sure how I would adjust to an automatic toothbrush, but after a week or so I successfully made the transition and would not go back. This is a basic brush, but works very well. I have noticed some whitening effects so far, but mostly I like the nice clean feeling I get every time without gum or tooth sensitivity. The proof will be in the pudding (when I return to the dentist) but for now I am completely satisfied. I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t see any issues that others describe, but if so I will update the review.</li>
    <li> I have been using the brushes that spin or vibrate for years and thought I was brushing good.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble with keeping my gums healthy and having them bleed a little when brushing no matter what I did or how often I did it.  It was time to get a new toothbrush recently and I decided to take the plunge and get a high-end, more expensive toothbrush.  This is something I never thought I would do because I never really thought there would be that much value in it.  Boy was I wrong.  This is the most amazing toothbrush I have ever used.  My teeth feel so clean it&#x27;s almost scary.  In one week I have noticed at least a shade or 2 gain in whiteness, and my gums no longer bleed.  I can&#x27;t say enough about just how amazed I am by that.  The brush heads on my old toothbrush would wear out within 4-6 weeks.  The Phillips heads are supposed to be good for at least 3 months before needing to be replaced, so over the life of the toothbrush I think it&#x27;s actually going to cost me a considerable amount less.  If any of you are not sure whether to take a chance and spend so much on a toothbrush, DO IT!  Your dental health is worth it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After 1 year my SoniCare is still in perfect shape, still holds a charge for about 2 weeks before letting me know it&#x27;s time to recharge, and my teeth are whiter and my gums are stronger than at any other time in my life.  I still HIGHLY recommend this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ll be getting the kids version for my daughters now that they are getting old enough to make use of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B electric for as long as I can remember and when my latest one died of old age I wanted to investigate the market.  I ended up buying this model [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush]].  The first time I used it I knew the Sonicare was a great improvement - it simply is a better instrument.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now and coincidentally I had a regular dental appt a few days ago.  The hygienist knew something was up, she remembers me because I have periodontal disease and she has to use her \\&quot;special instruments\\&quot;.  I told her as much as the Oral B is better than manual brushing - the Sonicare is that much better over the Oral B.  She and the dentist are Oral B users but as the hygienist said \\&quot;the proof is in the results\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think Sonicare is packaging this model anymore so I don&#x27;t know how many readers this review will reach, but if your at all hesitant - spend the extra money and get the best - its worth it.  A final caveat - I cannot speak to the durability yet.</li>
    <li> Thinner than the old sonicares. If you turn it off to spit, it doesn&#x27;t turn back on to the time you left it. Small details. I have crowns and bridges and implants and this toothbrush will help extend their life. Recommended for sure.</li>
    <li> Does the job but I like the older model better (non-curved brush).  This model does not massage and clean the gum line as well.</li>
    <li> excellent product. Long lasting battery between charges. makes teeth feel polished. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is amazing. I have never enjoyed brushing my teeth this much. I just bought it, and I have not seen all of it&#x27;s effects yet, but I can say in the few times I have used it, I have never felt my teeth this clean ever. In fact, they feel that way almost all day because it has such a deep clean.  This may be bizarre, but in all my brushing before this, when I brushed and then would spit out the toothpaste, it would normally still be around the same color of the toothpaste. The Sonic Care does such a great job getting the grime off your teeth that when you are finished and you spit out the toothpaste you are truly spitting out all the stuff that is on your teeth. Just shows how much I thought I was getting my teeth clean with an ordinary toothbrush to now.   I highly recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> Using this brush makes my teeth feel much cleaner.  Whether or not they are actually any cleaner I could not say, but they definitely FEEL cleaner.  The brush has a built in timer so that you can just turn it on and it will remain powered up for a certain amount of time and then you know you are finished brushing unless you just want a marathon cleaning.  The interchangeable heads make it a very nice addition for both me and my wife as we only had to purchase one toothbrush and just use two different heads.</li>
    <li> My prosthodontist suggested I buy one, and one that took the Diamond Brush heads (Healthy White, Flexcare or Diamond).. Immediately, the teeth feel cleaner, even though I had brushed for a longer time with a regular toothbrush... I charged it fully before use and have had 30 brushings (15 days) without a recharge.. and my prosthodontist saw the results after only three weeks of use and was so impressed, called in the hygenist to see the results..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with the price here of $74.. Costco had pair (two handles) for $119, but I don&#x27;t need two handles.. Did pick up a 6-pack of Diamond brush heads at Costco for $39..</li>
    <li> I am not new to electric toothbrushes, but I am definitely new to the high end spectrum.  My entire family uses the Essence, but when the HealthyWhite Sonicare went on sale on Amazon, I took the plunge.  I was not disappointed.  Initially, the new style of brushing takes some getting used to.  It is pretty powerful and can turn some people off if they are not used to electric toothbrushes.  It also cleans totally differently than the cheaper drugstore electric toothbrushes.  I will say that the Quadpacer technology is awesome.  It ensures that I get my teeth evenly clean and spend enough time doing the job.  I have had it for about two weeks now and my teeth are noticeably whiter after using the Clean and White setting.  I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone over the Essence if you want white teeth, and the bonus is that the brush heads are cheaper.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my deployment to Iraq in 2011 and it has been the perfect deployment toothbrush. I needed a brush with a dual voltage charger (110,220) and one that would be superior to other battery operated brushes . The brush has fantastic power, it cleans easily, and the head portion is removable if I have to store it in a small toiletry bag. However, the most amazing attribute has been the battery life. I charged the brush on January 14th, and then didn&#x27;t have to charge it again until June 16th, over 5 months later. I am certain that is not normal for any battery powered brush, and after a while it became an interesting game to see how long it was going to last. I use the brush daily, sometimes twice a day, and it still had strong battery power right up until the day I finally had to recharge it. It was if Sonicare inadvertently created a perpetual energy battery. I am now on day 46 of use again without having to recharge. Buy this brush because it is a great toothbrush, enjoy it for how long the battery seems to last.</li>
    <li> My old (could it be 10 years old? -- maybe) Sonicare was working great but I could no longer find brush heads for it.  So grudgingly I bought a new model.  I&#x27;m very happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the older model, this is smaller, lighter, and easier to handle.  Not that the old one was cumbersome -- this model is just a little more elegantly designed. The shape of the brush head is more slender and easier to use.  My teeth and gums really do seem cleaner after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has some bells and whistles I don&#x27;t really care about -- it needs some combination of button pushes to activate and turn off.  I haven&#x27;t bothered to figure them out -- I usually follow the beeps and finish brushing when it does, and if I&#x27;m in a hurry I brush a bit and then push that power button repeatedly until it goes off.  Maybe some cold day this winter I&#x27;ll take the time to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line -- I really like it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the regular toothbrush that my dentist recommended.  It seems this is for cleaning or whitening only not a regular daily toothbrush? Or at least that&#x27;s what it feels like to me because if I use it everyday, i feel like it&#x27;ll ruin my gum instead? The brush part is not really comfortable for me and hard. It seems to be too powerful that it feels like I&#x27;m getting a dental work done?  I&#x27;m a little disappointed and i didn&#x27;t get to use it right away and since i&#x27;ve already used it couple times, it&#x27;s probably too late to return?</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my daughter. She had this exact toothbrush for a year and a half and it quit working. She absolutely loves it! She said it makes her teeth feel so clean. I thought I paid a fair price for the item but then saw a two pack at Sam&#x27;s Club for only $30.00 more. I could have gotten a much better deal at Sam&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to give a low rating because this brush really gets the job done, the cleanest teeth I&#x27;ve ever had.  Unfortunately it also gave me blinding headaches and, even more damning, ripped up my cosmetic veneers.  It&#x27;s like a jack hammer/tornado combo.  If you do buy it (cleanest teeth ever) I suggest a LIGHT touch and not exceeding the two minute session timer.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to hold, easy to keep clean, and works very well. Two significant advantages for travelers are that the entire unit is relatively small and that the charger takes 220. The one-minute alert is silly and the necessity to push the on-off button twice is annoying. Hence the four stars.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested I get a Sonicare toothbrush as it would help my gums as well as my teeth.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference this toothbrush makes.  My whole mouth feels clean after every brushing in a way I&#x27;ve never felt before.  The best news is that my dentist says he sees a difference.</li>
    <li> Does what it should. Can get a good number of brushes out of a single charge. Has some lame &amp;#34;whitening mode&amp;#34;.  I have not found any utility for this. I also don&#x27;t like the timer, which cannot be turned off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great in typical sonicare fashion.  I don&#x27;t use the whitening function as often as I would like just because there is one button that is shared for \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;clean and white\\&quot;.  So you have to cycle through to the second feature to use the whitening feature.  Also, because there&#x27;s one button that&#x27;s used to cycle there isn&#x27;t a pause function.  If you remember older models you could put it into pause by pressing the button and then resume by pressing again.  Hard to imagine that they would skimp on that one button considering what they&#x27;re charging for these things.</li>
    <li> A replacement for one I have had for years.  It is responsible for my good dental visits and highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have had no problems with it at all.. just shop around for a great price..</li>
    <li> I had one of those old giant Sonicares for many years. Was getting cracked from the heat, the brushes were beyond gone. The HealthyWhite model seemed like it had what I needed in features, sort of the happy medium, so that is what I got.  Slim and stylish in retro-modern light green and off-white, perching on a much nicer recharging stand that isn&#x27;t disgusting and heat-stained like my old one. A more hygienic design all around and it has a thinner and more comfortable brush assembly.  Per the directions, I voided the break-in mode that is for those new to electric brushes and can find the vibrating action uncomfortable for awhile. I use the whitening cycle which gives you four thirty-second segments, one for upper outer teeth, one for upper inner and so on. Each segment&#x27;s time is signaled my a very brief motor pause. Then, for the whitening mode it switches to a more vigorous action. When that cycle is up, the thing turns off.  That is a lot of brushing, frankly more than ideal for me. I don&#x27;t really enjoy the whole oral care thing at all, I hate to floss for example, but this makes it the most tolerable for me and now I do it all just like you are supposed to. Clearly a vastly better experience than old generation electric brushes and would think hugely more effective than most people are going to get from a regular brush. Uninsured dental care is really expensive.   I obviously don&#x27;t have the tooth science background to discuss the merits of every brand out there, I imagine they end up being somewhat similar in terms of cleaning and plaque removal, but this model is relatively affordable, does seem to be very effective, is hygienic and easy to clean. The brushes are readily available. It looks good. Just fine in my opinion. Aside from some magic new technology that may be out there, I doubt that it can be much better.   Whitening is a hope. I want that diamond glint like in the movies (on demand of course), but I am pretty sure there is a limit to what one can expect. Some people simply have those ultra-white teeth and others never will, but this and some sort of whitening strips or treatment is probably going to give you the best possible results.</li>
    <li> Havent been to a dentist to know if it prevents plaque buildup but after brushing the mouth does feel fresh. Its head is small enough to reach corners of the mouth and as of now (after 3 months) it seems to be working wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Please be aware that with normal usage this product has a life expectancy of less than to just over one month. I bought my first one and it lasted less than a month and I was able to return it for a credit.  I  reordered the same model making the false assumption that the item that I had previously purchased was an exception.  It wasn&#x27;t.  The second purchase item lasted one month and one week.  And I will have to try and get a refund out of Philips. I now know not to buy Philps products.</li>
    <li> I bought this item one week ago and have been in love with it. It&#x27;s the first Power Toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned, and it&#x27;s done amazing jobs on my teeth! The 2 mins clean + 30 secs white program is so great to keep me brushing my teeth thoroughly. I used to be a impatient person when I brush my teeth. However, with this Programmed-toothbrush, I have to get the 2min 30secs job done and it&#x27;s not boring at all. I&#x27;m pretty sure that the power toothbrush have done way way better cleaning than using my bare hands brushing up and down in sort of 2Hz frequency movement.  I love it, and for sure I&#x27;ll get one more for my parents as the Xmas gift!</li>
    <li> I like this newer smaller model much better than the older and larger ones.  It has a good vibration rate but the battery life is still the limiting factor.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works great.  I have been using for a month now and my teeth have never been cleaner.  The only con I can see to this tooth brush is the brush life.  It is already indicating that I will need a new toothbrush soon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for my old Sonicare, which finally packed it in after close to a decade. After using a much older model for so long, I&#x27;m pleased to see the improvements, such as making it REALLY easy to keep clean. The old ones had several parts that needed to be taken apart and cleaned in order to prevent mildew because dark, moist spaces and things that go in my mouth are not a pleasant combination. The new models are more streamlined and only the head is removed for cleaning and replacement. I can&#x27;t compare it to other electric toothbrushes because I&#x27;ve only ever used the Sonicare brand, but I&#x27;m so happy with how my clean my teeth feel that I&#x27;m not really inclined to shop around.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e had my brush for over a year now so far and it still works well. It feels like a more effective cleaning compared to a basic brush. It stays charged for a very long time. I replace the brush heads with generic and store brand replacement heads.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. It is very messy and the toothpaste foam that forms in your mouth gets all over the place. It feels very awkward when your brushing your teeth and the other parts of the brush touch other parts of your teeth and mouth. Way better deal to get on Amazon than in the local store. Saved $20!</li>
    <li> The Phillips Sonicare Healthy White Power Toothbrush is easy to use, efficient, and I feel I get a good cleaning each time I use it. It sits on my sink area and does not take up a lot of space. The 2 minute timer is helpful in assuring that I brush for an adequate amount of time and the 2 power levels gives me options for the type of cleaning I need.  Would recommend this product for ease of use, doing what it promises and for the brand assurance.</li>
    <li> Never had an electronic toothbrush before, so I was really surprised how well it felt after I first used this product. After reading many reviews on many different products, I settled on the Philips Sonicare Healthy White Power toothbrush. I picked the Philips product that was in the middle price range. I think other users have mentioned the same thing, but the only thing I did not like, was you have to manually go to the extra whitening every time you brush. It would not stay on the extra level automatically. I guess that is OK, since I rarely use the extra 30 seconds that this mode does. But overall I think this is a great product.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I get a Sonicare toothbrush so I chose this one.  It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles as the top of the line, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it gets the job done just as well. It&#x27;s a pleasure to use and make me brush longer due to the timer. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing a better job of brushing.</li>
    <li> This is the third Sonicare I have owned.  Liked the quadpacer on the first one. Disliked second one as it seemed to collect more dirt where the brush screwed on to the handle and did not have the quadpacer.  Both had NiCd batteries which was there weak point.  This one has a Li-ion battery hope it will last longer.  The handle is smaller and my teeth feel cleaner after using it with the new style brush.  Until I see the dentist all I can say see the other reviews.</li>
    <li> Sonicare sent me this model as a replacement for my Elite series that died after developing a crack on the rubber button allowing water to seep inside the unit.  I didn&#x27;t like it at first, but got used to the new design.  Now after a little over a year, this one just quit working.  I really love these toothbrushes, but I&#x27;m really starting to doubt the quality.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but works well. I do wish there was a way to wrap the cord and get it out of the way.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product but it stopped working short of 5 months! My original one lasted over 4 yrs unfortunately it was too bulky.</li>
    <li> Great Experience.Prompt and correct delivery.</li>
    <li> Today&#x27;s Sonicare Toothbrushes break quickly, as they are not well sealed.    This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush over (+10 years), but the quality of manufacture and lifetime of the toothbrushes has precipitously dropped. This one didn&#x27;t even last to it&#x27;s 3rd birthday!  You think for the amount they charge and the cost of the replacement heads, they could make something that would last longer.    I also dislike how sonicare has made so many models of what is essentially the identical toothbrush, but with minor setting differences.  It used to be all the sonicare toothbrushes have a normal and soft mode, but now you have to pay for the highest level model for this feature, though it really does not cost anything additional for this feature.    The Philips customer service call center is not responsive to the problem and insisted the toothbrush failed because it&#x27;s \\&quot;not designed to be waterproof,\\&quot; which is ridiculous.  They suggested it failed because of overcharging, but this is patently not the case, because when I opened the toothbrush head there was a ton of moisture inside.    Sorry to get geeky here (I&#x27;m an engineer), but the design IMO poor, as there&#x27;s is no water adsorbing material to wick moisture that penetrates the 3 different o-ring seals (at the base, toothbrush top, and button).  See the pictures of the inside.  I can fix the toothbrush by pushing my pocketknife between the battery and the terminal (terminal corroded.  Anyway, doubt this will fix anything since the circuit has already started corroding in various spots, as has the motor.    This is typical of how they fail, consider yourself warned!!!!  (see pictures of inside)</li>
    <li> This was just what the Dentist wanted us to get and we followed his directions.  This has turned out to be a helpful addition to our cleaning regimine.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older E-series model (don&#x27;t remember the exact name; I had used it for about 10 years, but it would be comparable to today&#x27;s \\&quot;Essence\\&quot; model.)  This provides the same quality cleaning, with the advantage of not having a screw-on head that collects gunk underneath.  (It was always a little frightening to see what was living inside my toothbrush, and it&#x27;s not like I never cleaned in there.  It&#x27;s just a bad design.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the HealthyWhite compared to the other is the handle is slimmer, so the vibration is stronger against my hand.  This was very annoying at first, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and it no longer bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the \\&quot;clean and white\\&quot; setting as it doesn&#x27;t do anything but add a little time to the brushing cycle.  So I consider that pretty worthless as a feature.  Any brush would give you extra cleaning time by just pressing the start button again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using the HealthyWhite for about 3 years now, and I tried his before getting my own.  The charge stand has 2 pegs for extra heads, so it is possible to share the handle.  I would have preferred to do that, but swapping out the heads became too irritating.  The head pops on easily, but getting it off is a bit of a struggle.  I usually had to wrap a towel around the head and wiggle and yank until it came free.  So I took off a star for that.  A small release button for the head would have made this a perfect handle, as is it ranks \\&quot;only\\&quot; 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about charging the Sonicares: I saw in other reviews that several people have had problems with their handles dying prematurely.  I don&#x27;t know if this makes a difference, but we have always kept ours on the charge stands when not in use and have never had a problem with a handle dying, even after a decade or more of use.  As a bonus, the HealthyWhite charge stand is very small and keeps the handle upright, so it uses a minimum of counter space.</li>
    <li> The first day I used this electronic toothbrush, I felt a cleanliness that wasn&#x27;t comparable to a regular toothbrush. Great for a through cleaning. And from the 3 modes to choose from they are sufficient enough. I can tell this product will be with me for a quite awhile.</li>
    <li> We love our Sonicare and as I get older I realize it&#x27;s well worth the cost if it keeps my teeth in my mouth longer!! This is our second one and the first with the new brush heads that are much cheaper than the original Sonicare. Above all, I love that the brush doesn&#x27;t get as nasty and covered in grime like our first one. Heartily recommend. (There&#x27;s also a cool Healthywhite feature, which is nice, kind of like a buffing setting for your teeth).</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes are awesome and my whole family have one each but wish we could buy this product in Australia and department stores, although the service from Amazon.com is very good.  There is one little problem in that if people share the one product and have to change the heads frequently, they wear out alot quicker</li>
    <li> This brush is every bit as good as the more expensive FlexCare (which I have been using for the past 3 years)! I highly recommend this toothbrush! Also, Sonicare is very good about honoring their 2-year warranty as long as you keep your receipt.</li>
    <li> My friends have been using this for a while (well the older model at least) and they swore by it. I couldn&#x27;t justify an $80 tooth brush so I held off. Finally I bought my wife and I a pair of them and from the first brushing you can see why they&#x27;re worth it.   My teeth feel as clean as after a proper dentist cleaning every time I brush. No joke. Just follow the included instructions and you will not be disappointed. I&#x27;m currently running a test on the battery and it has lasted well over a week (still going), so no need to haul a charger on your trips.   I would also get quite often some gum bleeding with a normal brush (at least every couple of days). I have had the Philips now for about a month and it has only happened once (I must&#x27;ve been a little too vigorous that day).   You will spend more on replacement heads than a cheap non-powered brush, but it&#x27;s worth it. The new design of this brush and body is much more sanitary that they old design as well and it&#x27;s very easy to clean, basically just a total rinse off and you&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect toothbrush so far.  I&#x27;ve only had it about a month, but so far it&#x27;s the perfect toothbrush for me.  It has all the features I wanted (2 minute timer, divided in 30 second intervals, and the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; feature).  It&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter.  I had had another Sonicare toothbrush for about 15 years, and seem to have found the perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> I had been so frustrated with my Sonicare Essence toothbrush that I was actually excited when the unit finally stopped taking a charge. I did a lot of research on Amazon and other websites and it came down making a decision between Oral-B and Sonicare. I actually bought an Oral-B Professional Care toothbrush at Costco just to try out the features and compare it to the sonic technology. I didn&#x27;t like the small circular brush heads and I felt that the spinning of the bristles didn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as the vibrating Sonicare technology. I promptly returned this item and set out to by a new Sonicare product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint with the E-series was the incredibly poor design of the toothbrush heads that had to screw into the base unit. Smelly funky slimy stuff would start to grow inside the unit and all around where you would screw the items together - just a terrible design. I was happy to see that both the Healthy White and Flexcare products no longer had this stupid screw-on design. After lots of research I couldn&#x27;t find any key differences between the Healthy White and Flexcare sonic technologies so I went with the cheaper of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use I have no complaints with the toothbrush at all. If you&#x27;re used to Sonicare brushes then you will not be disappointed with this toothbrush. Of the two modes I use the more powerful one, but my wife prefers the softer mode. You can use a variety of toothbrush heads and none of them look to have that slimy gunk buildup problem.</li>
    <li> Love how well it cleans my teeth, but hate how hard they made it to replace the battery. I probably shouldn&#x27;t have put it on the charger all the time, because my sonicare lost its &amp;#34;voom&amp;#34; after about 10 months -- rendering it unusable. Good as new after replacing the battery, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery&#x27;s a Sony US14500VR2, which I replaced with a 14500 Sanyo 3.7V unprotected Li-ion rechargeable battery (840mAh, from orbtronic.com). I used only a butter knife and a pointy knife. I opened the battery compartment with the butter knife by rotating about 30 degrees counter-clockwise until it popped slightly, pushed down on the tip to get the assembly out. I then used the pointy knife to separate the battery terminals from the tabs. The tabs are spot welded to the battery, but 5 minutes of prying and wiggling later, you can lift out the old battery and plop in the new one. Make sure to leave the tabs soldered to the circuit board, of course.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist.  On recommendation from a seminar on dental health, I bought my friend one for a present and she had no complaints.  When my old brand died, I bought this product. Good products but it takes some getting used to when you switch from brands.  The sonic care vibrates significantly.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the product that I wanted...not too many bells&amp;whistles...just does its job well.  Charges up really fast.  Easy to clean.  Light in weight.  Well designed. I have used a Sonicare for many years and thought that they must have improved on the actions but no...the tooth cleaning actions are still the same and excellent....instead they have added all sorts of &#x27;other&#x27; options which don&#x27;t have anything to do with how well it cleans your teeth and treats your gums. This was the right Sonicare for the right price.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I&#x27;ve had two brauns over the last 12 years, with the second braun slowing down and needing daily charging after only two years. This sonicare is just amazing, it vibrates so much faster and with more force ... it really is head and shoulders above the braun. I&#x27;m not going back! I&#x27;ve owned it for a few months, and so far it&#x27;s been faultless</li>
    <li> ...when I went in for my biannual teeth cleaning appointment my dental hygenist said my enamel was wearing off/thin. She had never mentioned that before. No new eating/drinking habbits. Coincidence or because I was brushing 2x/day for the full cycle w/my HealthWhite toothbrush? I now only use it in the evenings w/an EnamelShield sensitive toothpaste and use a manual toothbrush in the mornings.</li>
    <li> When my Oral B Sonic Toothbrush failed I replaced it with this one. I had my dental exam several weeks later and I was told my teeth and gums looked better than they had ever looked at any check-up and the only change I had made was switching from a different sonic toothbrush to this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college student and when the semesters would get hectic I started drinking coffee like crazy! So as you can imagine, my teeth would gradually get more and more yellow. And I&#x27;m great about dental hygiene so this was driving me insane! No matter how much I brushed with my manual toothbrush, the yellow remained. I didn&#x27;t want to use a store bought whitener because I know they can be damaging to your teeth but I was getting desperate.     Luckily I stumbled across the Sonicare Healthy white Toothbrush online. As a college student, this wasn&#x27;t really in my budget but after thinking about it for a week (and getting another pay check) I made the purchase. And I am so happy I did!     This toothbrush is supposed to make your teeth whiter in 2 weeks and it did for mine, but I really started seeing whiter teeth after the 3rd week. And after about 2 months of using the product, my teeth look better than ever. Plus they feel ridiculously clean. And the great thing is, I can still drink coffee like crazy but now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my teeth! If you can bring yourself to spend the money on this toothbrush, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very effective at cleaning your teeth. I have experience with ultrasonics for cleaning parts in an industrial setting, so I expected it to work better than any other method for cleaning your teeth. A caveat for replacement heads: don&#x27;t buy the cheap ones from some other manufacturer. They come off during use and are useless. You may even injure yourself.</li>
    <li> This is the second Sonicare I purchased, the first one lasted about 18 months before battery died.  Had some erroding gums due to brushing too hard and some plaque build up on the far back mollars that was always being scrapped every 6 months.  after 6 months of use, my gums have recovered and no more plaque build up.  Replacement heads are a little high, but in the end it probably cost less than $10/month.  I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Three issues that aren&#x27;t bad, but be aware of : when you hit your teeth with the brush head the vibration will freak you out the first several time; you have to keep your mouth completely shut around the brush head or you will be cleaning your mirror every day; you need to cleaning between the head and the battery handle of you will get toothpaste build up.</li>
    <li> No frills, works as expected. Handle is a little thicker than ideal. I do not have anything more to say.</li>
    <li> Having used a regular toothbrush my whole life, this is my first experience with an electric. I did my homework on sonic technology, and got high marks on sonicare from family members that have used them for years. I just never wanted to spend so much for a toothbrush! I reasoned it out by the fact that my wife and I share the sonicare thanks to the interchangeable brush heads. Well worth the investment! My teeth have never felt so clean! Everytime I use it my whole mouth feels amazing! Even better, my wife&#x27;s bad breath is gone so now I want to kiss her more, which leads to happy times for both of us, its a win-win! I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Our dentist has been recommending this brand for a few years.  My wife bought one in July and gave me the same one for Christmas because she liked it so much.  Teeth feel clean.  The 30-second timer helps to make sure all teeth get equal time.  I usually use the second 2 minute period to give an even better cleaning.  Also the smaller base on the brush head helps with keeping it clean.  We took a 17-day road trip in the U.S. and found it to keep its charge if it was plugged in only overnight.</li>
    <li> worked great for about 3 months and then died. It just hummed for a while when you turned it on. My first Sonicare lasted for 10 years. I figured that I got a dud and ordered the newer version of this. It has been working great for year. Three stars - but I think it was just a lemon. I like Sonicare.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I have been using the HealthyWhite for a little over a week now and we both agree that it gives our teeth the best brushing we&#x27;ve ever had at home.     Our new dentist and the dental hygienist recommended Sonicare to us both as we both have some gum recession and sensitivity. Rather than just go right out and purchase the first Sonicare we saw on the shelf, we decided to look at the available options.     The other big player in the power toothbrush game is Oral B. There are several others as well, but reviews were difficult to find so the choice eventually came down to Sonicare or Oral B. Also considering that power toothbrushes run on the pricey side (for us anyway), I insisted on doing research.     My research included: Visiting both the Sonicare and Oral B websites and reading about all the different models; reading online reviews, including Amazon reviews, for each of the different models; and a lengthy discussion with our dental hygienist.    The companies&#x27; websites were useful for general information. For me, though, the Amazon and other online reviews, were much more helpful in pointing out problems/successes with both Sonicare and Oral B power toothbrushes.     I actually looked at reviews for each Sonicare and Oral B models. After reading the reviews for the lower priced (and apparently older? Sonicare models), like the Essence, I determined that I did NOT want to purchase any of those models. The primary reason: The design of these brushes apparently allows water/toothpaste to seep into part of the brush handle in such a way that mold forms.     With the HealthyWhite and the Flexcare, Sonicare solved this problem, but I was very skeptical about spending nearly $100 (or more!) for a toothbrush.      The Oral B apparently does not suffer from the design flaw of the lower priced Sonicare models and I was actually all set to go ahead with one of the lower priced Oral B models, until I spoke with the dental hygienist.     Following that conversation, I concluded that even if I purchased an Oral B for my own dental needs, we would still need to purchase a Sonicare for my husband, whose needs exceed mine a bit.    For us then it made sense to buy one brush handle and just purchase another brush head.    Although I had read about the difference between sonic dental technology (which Sonicare uses) and oscillating/rotating technology (that Oral B uses), it didn&#x27;t really make sense to me until my conversation with the hygienist.     The way it was basically explained to me as follows (Sorry if this is a bit graphic):    Sonic technology mixes the toothpaste with your own saliva. The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; part of the technology not only reaches the surface of the teeth but into spaces that no traditional brushing mechanism can reach, even getting in and around the gums.     The Oral B apparently uses the more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; brushing technology and only cleans the area that the bristles of the brush themselves can reach.     This changed my mind, especially in light of my husband&#x27;s dental needs. At that point, it made more sense to buy one of the newer Sonicare models.     When I first used the Sonicare I expected it to be very loud based on reviews I had read. In my opinion it is quieter than my hairdryer, the noise of which does not bother me. It did take both of us a few days to get used to the feeling of the brush on our teeth.     The Quadpacer technology is helpful, as is the timing mechanism that all Sonicare brushes have, but not really essential in my case: I prefer the longer \\&quot;Clean and white\\&quot; cycle and sometimes find that that is not long enough for me.     Some criticize the auto shutoff, but the easy solution to that is just to turn the brush back on. I can always turn it off if I don&#x27;t want to go through another 2 minutes.     I was a little surprised that the charger is so light and that the brush handle does not fit securely onto the charger: It just rests on the charger and could easily be knocked off. The charger does have room to hold 2 other brushheads.      I have not had any problems with the brushhead popping off the handle when I am brushing my teeth. I do have to be careful about keeping my mouth closed when I am brushing as well as remembering to not start the brush until it&#x27;s in my mouth.    Overall, though we are very happy with our Sonicare and we really hope it results in better dental appointments. If it does, then it is well worth it despite the higher price tag. My issue with the auto shutoff and the charger do not outweigh the benefits of this brush.    I would recommend this toothbrush, but before doing so I would first recommend talking to your dentist/hygienist and doing your own research. Everyone&#x27;s dental needs are unique and this brush (or any Sonicare) may not be the right fit for all.     Also, for those of you who do buy a Sonicare, if you register the brush with Sonicare (either online or with the card that comes in the package),the company will send coupons for additional products. I have not yet registered our brush so I don&#x27;t know how well this works or what kind of coupons Sonicare sends.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Advance I had for too many years to remember when I first got it, was a rock- 100% dependable for a long time and very solid.  This HealthyWhite feels flimsy.  It works fine.  But given the price, and the price of replacement brushes, I have to wonder, will it last ten years?  I doubt it.  It&#x27;s got that &#x27;one drop on a tile floor and throw it away&#x27; feel.  Again, I&#x27;m comparing it to the Advance, which was really built by another company altogether.  I&#x27;m not telling you anything after a month, only time will tell.  But go to a Target and see if you like the feel before you order it on-line.     Also, the base in chintzy- cheap.  Horrible?  No.  But it could have been much better.    Last point, I&#x27;d read some people (on Amaxon) saying their brush heads flew off the handle, so it stuck in my head. From my experience, this is not a concern- the way the brushes click onto the handle is secure and well designed and MUCH more convenient than the Advance model I started out by complementing.</li>
    <li> I only purchased this newer model because my old Sonicare Elite&#x27;s battery was dying.  Initially I bought the new version of the Elite and was sorely disappointed as it was heavier (!) than my old toothbrush.  For reference, Elite uses the cup-shaped screw-on head that trapped goop and mildew.  I returned that toothbrush (cheaper intro model) and \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to this HealthyWhite style toothbrush and am so glad I did.  The newer models that use the ProResults toothbrush head - the redesigned, smaller and more hygienic (no mildew nor slime)- are pretty much the same - just a difference in how many cycles are available.  This newer design not only was lighter but also more effective.  Those stats claiming x% more effective cleaning for this model in the Sonicare comparison table were hard to believe but I was convinced one night after a few glasses of red wine stained my front teeth.  I could not get the dark stains off with the old Sonicare Elite.  Normally I&#x27;d use Crest Whitestrips to bleach the stain out.  This time I tried using my new HealthyWhite brush and it brushed the stain off in the first 30 seconds!  Wow, that alone saves me from having to bleach whiten my teeth, never mind having a cleaner set of teeth.  If you have an older Sonicare model it is very worthwhile to spend the $$ and upgrade.  The toothbrush head redesign is a godsend - no more slimy mildewy mess.  And the cleaning effectiveness is amazing!</li>
    <li> Philips has a policy of using battery and charging base materials that stop working soon after the warranty period to maintain you as a repeat customer. I am switching over to water pik and from what I can tell they use better quality materials to begin with and prices are similar. Buy Philips Sonicare at your own risk.</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush is slender, is easy to handle and most of all is easy to keep clean.  It does a remarkable job of whitening the teeth. I&#x27;ve had the other Sonicare electric toothbrush for several years.  This Sonicare R710 is the greatest so far.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I have ever used.  Gets my teeth SUPER clean. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Used two earlier versions of the Sonicare during the past three years. The R710 is much improved, easier to clean and does a better job of cleaning - made me happy the previous version \\&quot;died\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Replaced my husband old toothbrush with this one...great dentist check-up.  He can&#x27;t live without this now that he has used it for 6 months.</li>
    <li> So far I love this toothbrush.  Its been about a month, no probs.  I read many reviews and I am following some advice such as only charging when needed (I havent had to charge since the first day I got it) and also not getting toothpaste into the crack where the brush attaches.  Only a small amt of toothpaste is needed. When I brush I do not allow toothpaste and saliva to drip down the brush (thats so gross).  I take the brush off and store them apart.  I havent had any paste or water get into that area at all.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to be using this toothbrush every day.  It was recommended by my Dental Hygenist.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for 10 years, my dentist can&#x27;t give me enough praise on my dental hygiene.. I attribute it all to my Sonicare</li>
    <li> This Sonicare was sent to me as a replacement for a more expensive Sonicare I had that broke under warranty. (Lovely, replacing my more expensive one with this one...) Anyway, this toothbrush also let me down. The battery held a charge for about 2 months normally, then very quickly, started to be able to hold enough charge for maybe 2 brushings. I called Philips and they had me reset it which of course did not fix the problem. I didn&#x27;t bother having them replace this one because it was the second one in a row that failed miserably within months.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he loves it! His teeth started looking whiter right away. Now I need to buy one for myself! If you want to share a base and have different heads, it&#x27;s set up for that and has little colored rings to identify who&#x27;s is who&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The whole family has one.  Your teeth will feel so clean and dentist always comments on the lack of plaque build up between cleanings</li>
    <li> update: like this enough that I got another one for the office  --------------------------------      I had used the E-series type of brush for about 15 years and when the battery on the last one died ordered one of these     1. it does seem to clean better, the teeth feel noticeably smoother than with the E-series type design  2. it is much easier to clean- the snap on brush is a much better design than the screw on type design of the E-series  3. the smaller brush gets into the nooks and crannies better- I have big teeth that are a bit out of alignment  4. the \\&quot;healthywhite\\&quot; function is nice but hitting the start button twice does not always engage it    overall this is a big step up from the E-series type design and costs about the same    will have to wait and see how long the battery lasts and have not yet checked how many uses it gives on a full charge (the charger is pretty small and can be taken on trips)</li>
    <li> This is my very first electric toothbrush and I&#x27;m totally in love with it! I really leaves your teeth clean, it&#x27;s easy to use and to keep clean. I also love the timer features and the fact that it isn&#x27;t loud at all (don&#x27;t need to worry about waking my husband up early in the morning). Highly recommend this little one! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> After many, many years of using an older model sonicare toothbrush, it was time to replace it as the batteries no longer held a charge very well.  Obviously the older model was very durable.  The only negative aspect of the older sonicare was that the detachable brush head accumulated a nasty layer of toothpaste and gunk between the body and brush head.  The new brush head solves that problem.  I was a little worried when considering the new model as some of the reviewers complained about the brush head coming off while they were using the toothbrush.  I wanted to have some experience with the new sonicare before writing the review so that I could address this issue.  I have used the new sonicare for more than 6 months.  I have had no problems with the brush head coming off during use.  In my opinion, the new brush head attachment design is a great improvement.  I have previously used electric toothbrushes from other makers as well as the older sonicare.  The sonicare R710 is the best electric toothbrush I have used.</li>
    <li> Use it every day - does great. Since I drink coffee, my teeth tend to yellow and this certainly helps keeping them white.</li>
    <li> It has been 2 years and I am still waiting on the rebate from Phillips.  I even have a copy of what was sent including the upc code and all.  Before you buy go to their website and see if you can contact them.  Also consider the replacement brush heads cost and compare them to oral-b</li>
    <li> I had an old Sonicare that was probably 10 years old.  The battery would no longer hold a charge, so my search began for a new one.  Sonicare has many to choose from, but this one did everything I needed it to do.  Works perfectly!  Hopefully, this one will last 10 years as well.  Highly recommend Sonicare products!</li>
    <li> Works a lot better than I expected it to. I purchased this because of the positive reviews and I don&#x27;t regret it. Didn&#x27;t have it long enough for historical or comparison data but I can tell, operationally, it feels very effective. The sonic action gets deep between he teeth, targets hard to reach areas at the back, and leaves that clean feel. It the job done!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel like I just left the dentist office. They stay stain free and oh so white. Wish I had purchased this toothbrush a long time ago. I look forward too brushing and do so more often.  A must have.</li>
    <li> holds a charge for a very long time. no gunky build up as with the Essence model I used for many years. very slim fit in the hand. hang on tight! seems to clean much better than the Essence due to higher vibration frequency. well worth the money, except Sams Club had a 2fer (including cases) for the Easy Clean model at $119. not sure I would use the whitening mode as regular is more than enough. for the price Philips should include a case. it doesn&#x27;t fit in my old Essence case. if registering product immediately an extra 6 months is added to the 2 year warranty. hope it lasts as long as the Essence.</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare for many years and have always been highly satisfied with the quality and value. I would reccomend this Sonicare product to anyone. This purchase was to replace a previous Sonicare that was about 6 years old...it still worked fine, but I was ready for an upgrade.</li>
    <li> I like the feeling of my teeth and gums after using this toothbrush.  A little hard to let go of the old way of brushing but I&#x27;m getting there.  I use less tooth paste than I did before which is good.</li>
    <li> After using an Elite Series Sonicare for years, I was initially skeptical about this moderately-priced \\&quot;HeathyWhite\\&quot; toothbrush. But after my old E Series died, I went without a Sonicare for months--my mouth just didn&#x27;t feel as clean as it used to after manual brushings. I read reviews and just decided to go for it. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! It cleans just as well as my E Series did and I am huge fan of the brush head design. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and I have no complaints yet! The battery life is also fantastic. No complaints from me about this great little brush.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both had receding gumlines and the dentist recommended an electronic toothbrush.  The Sonicare was the highest rated so we bought it and both fell in love immediately!  Gives an incredible clean feeling and is dentist-approved, too :)  Gumlines are staying put for now too!</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is easy to use and is lighter in weight than my previous model. The battery holds a charge and is easily recharged.</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare finally wore out so I bought a new one at CVS.  I like this one so much, I made my husband get one, too.  I ordered it from Amazon as it was much cheaper.  This toothbrush is very light and very powerful.  I recommend it as an upgrade, even if you already have an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quiet and gets the job done.  Charge lasts long enough to take it on a trip without bringing the charger.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I had a cheap oral b tooth brush for years! I been hearing a lot about sonicare and decided to switch. I love it! Cleans way better!</li>
    <li> Quit working after a year. Too expensive to keep replacing. I&#x27;ve had 3 now in 4 years. Switching to a different brand</li>
    <li> I bought my first Sonicare toothbrush back in 2002, an original E-series, and I used it until it wouldn&#x27;t recharge any more, which was about Christmas 2008.  After using a manual toothbrush a few weeks, I decided I simply had to get another Sonicare.    I upgraded to the R710, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The lithium batteries make it smaller, lighter, easier to handle, and just more... toothbrush-like.  The E-series always was a handful.  Plus, Sonicare has apparently improved their ultrasonic technology over the last 6 years... the R710 is significantly more powerful than my old one was.  The only downside I&#x27;ve found is that, since the R710 has 2 cleaning modes (whereas my old model had only one), turning the unit off in mid-cycle requires pressing the button twice instead of just once.  The first press switches modes, and the second press finally turns it off.</li>
    <li> Fire and forget. This is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had one for a few months now and find it works well. It&#x27;s reliable, has a good feel, keeps the brush recharged, and lasts. It really has just one mode worth futzing with and no fancy readout. For years my wife and I had used disposable electric toothbrushes. This feels about the same except the brushes seem to last longer and as it&#x27;s rechargeable, of course, you don&#x27;t throw it away. It&#x27;s just one more aspect of life simplified. Pair this with a waterpik and your dental hygienist will look forward to your visits.</li>
    <li> I travel frequently and when away miss the Sonicare brush we have at home.  If I brush with my old travel electric tooth brush I just don&#x27;t feel I have done my teeth justice.  So I purchased the HealthyWhite Power for a travel tooth brush.  It&#x27;s small and, like its big brother at home, can carry a charge for more than a week&#x27;s brushing so I can dispense with carrying an additional cord and charger base to add to my computer, GPS and cell phone chargers that I must carry.  If you haven&#x27;t tried any Sonicare toothbrush you just don&#x27;t know what you and your teeth are missing.</li>
    <li> I have been using my new Sonicare for a week and it has changed my life!  I had an old Sonicare from years ago, but in several moves it got lost somewhere in my junk.  I have been having tooth and gum pain, and a lot of sensitivity to hot/cold.  I started using this new Sonicare, and all pain, sensitiviy, and gum pain is gone!  So are all the little swollen spots around the teeth that were little infection abcesses that wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what product I tried.  Due to the superior cleaning I get from the Sonicare, all the tender spots in my mouth have healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Sonicare twice per day, and it&#x27;s the next best thing to a dentist&#x27;s cleaning, maybe just as good!  After about the 3rd day, I could tell my teeth were getting whiter.  After a week, no more sore spots, and mouth feels fresh and clean - I can smile a lot more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should get a Sonicare.  My old one was great, this new one is phenomenal.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried those cheap $20 electric toothbrushes and went back to manually brushing my teeth, but the last time I went to the dentist I had more plaque than usual and I&#x27;m getting older so I worry about losing my teeth. I asked my hygienist what she used as her teeth are beautiful. She said she used the Sonicare and didn&#x27;t like it at first because it felt weird, but kept at it for a week and was hooked. She gave me a $10 coupon and I got one last weekend. Apart from it tickling the roof of my mouth it is wonderful! My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned every time I brush! I let my husband try it with one of the spare brushed we&#x27;d bought and loved it as well. When I saw it on here for half what I paid at a big box electronics store, I bought one for him.  I have the HealthyWhite version which is anywhere from $109 to $139 depending on where you get it.  I felt sick when I saw how low the price on here was.  Should have checked here first.</li>
    <li> I really wish the replacement heads we&#x27;re cheaper. It&#x27;s a great toothbrush in all but the replacement heads are hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Sonicare rechargeable toothbrushes for many, many years.  Our old one recently died (rubber button finally gave way on one of them) and we replaced it with this model.  What a difference!  If you are still using an older model, I&#x27;m here to say that you will benefit from retiring it now and buying the latest.  The latest model is much faster and does a more thorough job of cleaning.  The brush head is also designed for much easier cleaning--no more urge to upchuck when you unscrew the head...</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re VERY Pleased with Our new Sonic Care Electric Toothbrush. It was Delivered On Time, Works Well &amp; was a Good Buy for the Price.  :)  Joseph, II</li>
    <li> Love their products, just bought another one. Not to get all PC on everyone, but is Philips really convinced that calling a product &#x27;White Power&#x27; will help their North American marketing? Given that Philips ain&#x27;t from around here, it&#x27;s hard to see how people who aren&#x27;t members of the Church of the Perpetually Offended would rate it much higher than a middling hoot. But it is a large Church, after all, and its worshippers are doubtless members of the toothbrush-purchasing public. I certainly hope Philips wasn&#x27;t striving for irony: imagine an American product marketed in the UK under the trademark \\&quot;Skinhead\\&quot;.  Or maybe \\&quot;Lebensraum\\&quot; for Eastern Europe and an economical \\&quot;Generalissimo\\&quot; for the South?  Come to think of it, how about a brand name that would offend everyone: \\&quot;EU\\&quot;?</li>
    <li> I love it. I was buying the battery operated toothbrushes for about $6. This was more expensive but I will not go back.  After I use it my mouth feels clean and that is good.</li>
    <li> I had this toothbrush for less than 2 years and it already bit the dust. The peg that attaches the brush head appears to be the culprit of the problem. However, it hadn&#x27;t been dropped so I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s no longer working. I would expect a $100 toothbrush to last longer. It was great while it lasted...</li>
    <li> I received my toothbrush by the estimated date. It is easy to use and does exactly what it says it does! My teeth look and feel clean!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is awesome. I had the essence series prior to this one, but the healthy white is much much better. You can notice your teeth getting whiter after each brushing. I also like the fact that it is lighter and that the head is different; the essence would accumulate gunk inside which was pretty gross, but this one does not have that problem. I recommend this brush to anyone considering to buy it! Also, the shipping through amazon was amazing and I got the package before expected.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Sonicare Elite for several years. When the battery finally died, I purchased the HealthyWhite toothbrush. The toothbrush feels good in my hand and the new ProResults brush feels like it covers more tooth surface and thus cleans better. The lithium-ion battery is a great improvement and I have used it for two weeks without having to recharge it. This performance will come in handy on trips and vacations. The clean and white feature gives an extra 30 seconds of run time so you can concentrate on the teeth in the front of your mouth for that extra bit of cleaning. The one thing that irks me is the charging base. It is very light and can move on your counter top if the cord is moved in any way. A bit more weight in this area would be beneficial. Overall, I have found this brush to be worth the money and it seems to be a well designed and made toothbrush. My Elite was made in the U.S. but the HealthyWhite is made in China. I hope over time it proves to be as durable and reliable as my Elite was.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is the no-frills version.  It is perfect, since the previous model we had was loaded with fancy-smancy features that were never used.  This unit turns on, does its job and then you shut it off, and it costs a whole lot less.  The old one lasted about 2 years and then the battery died. Not bad.</li>
    <li> I had an Oral B for years until I moved to the South and had to give it up because of increased mildew problems on the brush heads.  I have been using manual toothbrushes for years since then and have been unhappy.  I don&#x27;t think they do a good job and always feel like my teeth still have a film on them even after brushing!  I liked that the new Sonicare brush heads were small and completely enclosed so there was no chance of growth.  I also liked that the Healthy White was reasonably priced in case it did not last more than a couple of years.  Since I bought it, the brush has been great!  Not only does it prevent film on my teeth, but it got rid of the built-up that had already been there!  I like the vibration sensation and my gums feel less sore since I no longer have to brush so hard manually.  My mom and dad have been using theirs for years (one of the earlier models) and love it!  I have been so happy with my brush that my previously skeptical husband now wants to purchase extra brush heads so he can use it!</li>
    <li> Ive owned a braun toothbrush that is similar to this one in the past, but I must admit this toothbrush takes things to a new level.  I definately saw my teeth color change to a whiter shade.  I have super clean teeth now all the time, and they are smooth and plaque free.  This toothbrush is a joy.  Even regular soft brissle tooth brushes caused my gums to bleed in the past, so I was afraid this thing moving so fast was gonna do damage, but after using both modes 1-2 times a day, I never see red in my spit anymore, so it also seems to have stregthend my gums and or is just so much softer where it doesnt hurt me when I brush. The heads have the thing on them that tell you when they need to be replaced.  I swear after 3 weeks, it wanted my to replace the head.  I was like hell no, this thing still looks new except for the color fading, so I have stuck with it for a while now, and it still seems to be doing its thing.  My only suggestion is dont replace the head as often as they want you too, im sure its more for putting money in their pockets then the toothbrush actually losing its efficiency to clean your teeth!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I have ever owned,its very powerful and a single charge last for over a week.</li>
    <li> I reviewed a lot of electric toothbrushes and the prices and I ended up ordering the Healthy White Power Toothbrush.  I am very happy with it.  Once you start using a electric toothbrush it&#x27;s hard to go back to a regular toothbrush.  I would recommend this Sonicare.  Also Amazon had the best price!!</li>
    <li> My old Philips electric tooth brush gave up the ghost after 5 years of  faithful brushing.  In just two months of using a regular toothbrush a  little plaque had started to build up on my back molar.  Hygienist  recommended I get a new Philips Sonicare (it&#x27;s the best).  Put in a quick  order to Amazon (my favorite store)and now my teeth are sparkling again.  This toothbrush is such an improvement over the old model.  Give it 5 stars.    M. G.  Clearwater Beach,FL</li>
    <li> My family has been using Sonicare for the past 7 years and I won&#x27;t use any other product. When I&#x27;m finished brushing my teeth, I know that my teeth are really clean. My trips to my dental hygenist is much more pleasant thanks to socicare. Will never use another electric toothbrush ever again!</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare, and a vast improvement over the last...mainly in the joining of the base to the brush. My older model has gone to a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; head that fits several models. With this newer head, gunk collects between the brush and the base. It&#x27;s pretty nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This newer model has a snap on head, and so far, I have not collected gunk in between. The brushing is a little different, but I don&#x27;t know how much difference that makes. There is an added feature to \\&quot;whiten\\&quot; your teeth, but I think it&#x27;s basically additional time spent brushing that makes the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with the new HealthyWhite toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced and does a great job. There&#x27;s two problems with it though..  1) Make sure you shake off the water because it falls to the bottom and just sits there, which can create mold.  2) Take of the brush attachment and clean that area often.  If you see any kind of growth (yes, gross) on the rubbery portion there, DO NOT try and take it off. Breaking the seal will cause it to stop working because eventually water will get in there.  This happened on both our units and had to purchase new ones.  The growth happens quicker that you think.</li>
    <li> My first Philips Sonicare lasted over 10 years.  However since then, I have had two others, each broke after less than two years of use.</li>
    <li> This replaced an old Sonicare after many years of use. We love it! Our previous model had a head that twisted on and the inside of the handle tended to get mildewed over time. We like the heads on this model MUCH better. They slide on, no place for mildew buildup. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.  I love how it makes my mouth and gums feel.  It is easy to use since it prompts you to change quadrants.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush cleans your teeth and gives you that uuhhnnn clean feeling, I like it, also a noticable change in the white of my smile.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this brush, it tickled. But it didn&#x27;t take more then a day or two to get used to the feeling, after using only a regular toothbrush. That day or two was well worth it! I already had fairly white teeth. My dentist would compliment me, but after using this toothbrush for a couple of days, people that have known me for years commented on how white my teeth were! Also, my teeth feel much cleaner. I&#x27;ll never go back to a conventional toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I have owned the standard old fashioned Sonicares for at least 12 years.  I decided to upgrade to the Healty White.  I have had it about 3 weeks and the jury is still out on the white part.  The size, cleanability, and extra speed is worth the extra money.  A good improvement to great products.</li>
    <li> I had one of the same that lasted about 10 years. Have always liked this one. Had others but they did not work as well at cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> Well designed, holds charge for over a week, very efficient brushing, easier to hold in the hand that previous models. What else can I ask for?</li>
    <li> My wife and I purchased the 710 about 3 months ago.  We got a set of two. My wife&#x27;s brush just quit working. It is fully charged and it lights up, but it has frozen up and is useless.  Mine is still working, but, for how long?  What irritates me is that we just bought replacement heads thru Amazon a few weeks ago.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. I have seen a difference in how white my teeth are after 2 weeks.  It gives you a cleaner brush than any other toothbrush on the market. Especially being an invisalign patient  I know how much I love this product. I had one before but left it in a hotel... happy to see the amazing prices on amazon!</li>
    <li> My 15 year old Sonicare finally gave up working and I had to buy a replacement.  I ended up buying this one and am happy with it.  So what&#x27;s the problem?  I found it almost impossible to wade through Sonicare&#x27;s marketing materials to discover which brush was best for me.  15 years ago Sonicare had one product.  Turn it on, let it vibrate, brush your teeth.  These days, the product is essentially the same, the only difference is now you can buy a unit that vibrates a little, a little more, a little more again, etc.  You get the drift.  But they don&#x27;t market them like I just described.  They market them using goofy labels like \\&quot;Diamond Clean\\&quot;.  Do you have any idea whether you want \\&quot;Diamond Clean\\&quot;, \\&quot;Ultimate Clean\\&quot; or \\&quot;Advanced Clean\\&quot;?  I don&#x27;t either.  And they have a Sonicare for \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot; and a different one for \\&quot;Whiter Teeth\\&quot;.  I guess if you want both gum care and white teeth you either have to pick one over the other or buy two?  Its silly marketing.  This particular unit is the cheapest one with the new syle thin brush heads.  It has two vibration levels. If it was 10 bucks cheaper and had only one vibration level I&#x27;d like it even better.</li>
    <li> i purchased this at walgreens for fifty more dollars than what it sells for here, so if you can get it for under a hundred, it&#x27;s a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then, it&#x27;s an investment because it&#x27;s going to pay for itself with the money you save by not having to have to have your teeth cleaned and by not having to go to the dentist to have cavities filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i can compare it with the oral b electronic toothbrush it&#x27;s in a league of it&#x27;s own.  the comparison is like a mercedes compared to a ford pinto.  it costs more, but it&#x27;s an entirely different product and performs at an entirely different level.  read the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on a full recharge, the charge lasts for about twenty five brushes or more.  i haven&#x27;t counted exactly.  it goes for about two weeks.  don&#x27;t leave your toothbrush on the charger or you&#x27;ll ruin the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a quality product that is worth every cent you pay for it.  this item along with other dental health products: waterpik, listerine, hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, toothpaste, and you&#x27;ll never have a problem with bad breath or with your teeth.  except for one thing; if your teeth are compromised already, this brush may be hard on them.  my dentist recommended i have a crown on a tooth, and pointed out how i&#x27;ve neglected my teeth, then after purchasing the soniccare it shook the filling out the compromised tooth.  i suspect some of the bad reviews may point to this problem, but i can testify with certainty that the problem was on my end.  i didn&#x27;t take care of my teeth because i should have had one of these years ago.  but better late than never.  i&#x27;m glad i own one of these.</li>
    <li> We have used Sonicare toothbrushes for years and this one seems as good, or better, than the others.  We travel and its great that this model (R710) has a \\&quot;world\\&quot; charger and not just the 110 - 115V that our previous models have.    However, I feel I made two mistakes:  1)  This model does not come with a carry case  2)   I purchased at Target, could have saved $30 through Amazon.  Yea, could return it, but...</li>
    <li> The Sonicare R710 is a large improvement over the older Sonicare Elite model. It is much quieter and does not collect debris under the inside of the brush head needing constant cleaning for sanitary reasons. You can actually feel the difference after using this newer model in comparison to the older Elite. I purchased this product for my wife as a birthday gift and she is elated. I will purchase another of this R710 unit when my old Elite dies. I found a large savings on Amazon as compared to discount store prices in town.  Thanks Phillips Sonicare</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement for the one I accidentally left in China. It was originally recommended by my dental hygeniest and it makes you brush your teeth for a full two minutes like you are supposed to. The charge lasts for a long time, so you don&#x27;t have to take the base with you when you travel. Just don&#x27;t accidentally leave it in a foreign country!</li>
    <li> I purchased this model based on other reviewers&#x27; comments.  It was a pretty significant cost savings to purchase it on Amazon vs. some of the other retailers that carry this model.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and so far, so good.  My dentist said using an electric toothbrush cleans your teeth about 70% better than a manual one so I figured it was definitely worth a try.  My teeth do feel cleaner and I like the timer on it that helps you keep track on how long you&#x27;ve been brusing and beeps when it&#x27;s time to move the brush to another area of your mouth.  As far as noticing whiter teeth - not really sure I&#x27;ve seen much on that but that could just take a little more time as it&#x27;s only been a few weeks now.  Overall I do like the product and have no regrets on purchasing it.  And as usual Amazon not only offered the best price but it was delivered quickly as well.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothbrush for sure.... works just as described and I love all of the features. The quadpacer is worth it for me since it forces me to brush all sections of my mouth evenly and this brush head is much cleaner than the one for the cheaper model that screws on and off. Also, the charge lasts over 3 weeks.... I haven&#x27;t let it die all the way yet, but I&#x27;ve only been charging it every three weeks. I don&#x27;t use the whitening option that often, but the few times I did I thought it did make a difference. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> A big change from those lumbering electric toothbrushes of the 1960&#x27;s.  Quiet.  Extremely fast.  Does a great job of cleaning teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older version with the head that collects gunk and stinks.  I like the sealed design better, but it quit after 8 months.  Phillips is sending me a replacement.  Shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with this so soon.</li>
    <li> My teeth usually only feel this clean after a visit to the dental hygienist!  I love it, my teeth love it, and my gums love it!  Also, if you go to the Philips Sonicare site you can find some coupons and if you do purchase this brush and register it you will get additional coupons (discounts on the brush heads mainly or an extended warranty period).  I wish the replacement heads were a bit cheaper, but I can&#x27;t complain and love how my mouth feels.</li>
    <li> I tried this toothbrush last year when visiting my parents. When I got back home I ordered it right away. I love the professional clean feeling it leaves my mouth feeling. My husband wasn&#x27;t sold on it right away but after his teeth got noticeably whiter within a month of use he was sold on the the toothbrush too!</li>
    <li> THe only complaint I have is that I often have very sore gums after I brush, but this is due to poor dental care. The amount of shrapnel this toothbrush flings off my teeth is amazing. I am forced to floss after because it works so well. Battery lasts forever. Brushheads wear out pretty quick, but this is probably due to my horrible teeth. I wish the replacement heads weren&#x27;t so expensive, but with a coupon and a sale they are as cheap as Oral B and SOOOOOOOOO much better!</li>
    <li> I decided that I needed a litte bit more hate in my life, and the Sonicare white power toothbrush fit the bill. Now I can curb stomp with my buddies with sparkling white teeth. Thanks philips!</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes since they came out. My first one, the Advance lasted 12-13 years! My second, E-series, lasted less than two before it started doing the random turn-on thing and then just died altogether. Because they come so highly recommended by my dentist, and because I do feel like my teeth are really, really clean after I use them, I decided to try out this new healthywhite version.&lt;br /&gt;I like the new design of the head; I used to open up my brush every week and spray the inside with anti-mildew spray to prevent mildew and general grossness from building up in there. This new design doesn&#x27;t allow for that to happen, so that is nice. I like how it cleans my teeth. I like the smaller size of the entire base and that the base is easier to clean than the larger previous models.&lt;br /&gt;However, the brush heads do NOT stay on. Luckily, I haven&#x27;t had one hit me in the face like the other reviewers, but they fly off and land in the sink or floor, or simply just come apart in my mouth. Annoying. The brush came with some plastic ring thing, I have no idea what it was supposed to do, it neither helped seal the brush head on the base nor did it prevent the gap between the two, and one of the times the brush head flew off when I was brushing, the ring went down the drain. I&#x27;ve tried the sonicare brand brush head and the target brand brush head, they both are very loose, with the target one being worse. I can&#x27;t keep the thing on. I am not sure how well it is able to clean loose or when i have to hold it against the brush, while brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I have had the thing for less than six months and it is practically useless. I do not have the box or receipt any more so I guess I am stuck with it. If Sonicare is going to make these brushes significantly less quality than their predecessors, why do they still cost $80-$100+?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;Found the box, called the number. They agreed to send me new brush heads. One week passed, no brush heads showed up but then my toothbrush started turning on randomly (and scaring the heck out of me!!)  But this was the same thing my old one started doing right before it died. So I called again, and they sent me another tooth brush. This one seems to be an updated version of the same model (whitening one). The brush head firmly connects to the base and, so far, all is well.hbrush started turning on randomly (and scaring the heck out of me!!)

    <li> I love this toothbrush. It&#x27;s worth the money if you can get it on sale. I find that the whitening feature isn&#x27;t really producing any major results for me, but I still love the clean. Since I have braces right now, it really helps make sure no little food pieces get stuck in my teeth or between the wires.  My favorite features of this product are:  -The Timer: it tells you when to switch areas of your mouth and when to stop  -The Internal Battery, so you don&#x27;t have to mess with AAs  -The Sonic movement: It cleans much better and moves in a quicker, more different way than cheap electric toothbrushes  -From what I can see, it&#x27;s pretty waterproof or at least water resistant  Overall, I would buy one of these if you don&#x27;t already. It will really change how you feel about your teeth and the cleanliness level of them.</li>
    <li> All those years w/o this building up plaque. Now when I go to the dentist there is noticeably less chiseling away the plaque that is just not there any longer. Also, the whitening feature just seems to work. I haven&#x27;t felt the need to bleach my teeth ever since I got mine over 1 1/2 years ago.</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to at first, lots of drooling ;) ...you definitely don&#x27;t need as much toothpaste as a standard toothbrush. My teeth feel cleaner than ever!!</li>
    <li> The brush head pops out of the shaft after a few weeks, making it impossible to brush without the thing disintegrating in the middle of a brush cycle. It can also be downright dangerous if the brush head flies into your mouth at high speed, as has happened with me. Sadly, Sonicare&#x27;s customer service is dreadful. They will replace this with another unit, which does the same thing. They will not ship you any other model, even if you volunteer to pay more for an upgrade.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 years and I have not had any dental issues.  The dentist always comments on how clean my teeth are.  I just purchased this Sonicare R710 as a replacement.</li>
    <li> We got this toothbrush as a wedding present--It&#x27;s great. We really love it and would recommend it to others. The only downside is that it just up and died on us after a year of use. Philips was great about sending us a new one though. I would recommend this toothbrush but encourage new owners to register the product.</li>
    <li> I am a huge advocate for sonicare toothbrushes. I grew up having a cavity practically each visit to the dentist. Since buying my first sonicare 10 years ago I haven&#x27;t had one. KNOCK ON MAJOR WOOD! But seriously. This toothbrush has paid for itself and then some. I am on my 3rd sonicare since I bought my 1st, just because I think they get gross eventually. I have since made my husband use one, as well as my kiddo!</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush 3 weeks and so far it is great.  Light weight, easy to operate, cleans easily.  The only objection so far is the stand is so light and small that the toothbrush easily falls over with a slight knock.  I am hoping the battery has a long life.</li>
    <li> I started to use the Philips Sonicare when one of my friend gifted me few years back. It eventually stopped working and had to buy new one... So, spoke to my dentist friend and got this product. It is really good, not harsh on teeth or gums... I like the &amp;#34;clean &amp; white&amp;#34; feature, as it gives extra one more minute to brush, when it whitens the teeth. It is too early to say if it really works... May after couple of weeks, I may see any difference... Overall it is a good product....</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I purchased one for myself and for my daughter. We both love it. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference between using the Sonicare and using a regular toothbrush. Your teeth feel amazing. Just like after leaving the dentist.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush after having lots of plaque build up and the beginnings of gum disease.  This despite thorough cleanings with Braun Oral B that I had used happily for years.  A friend recommended it and I followed up with lots of internet research.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the purchase!  I have yellowish teeth naturally (red hair beginnings) and I drink tea every morning.  After only 1 week using this toothbrush on the regular setting, my teeth are noticeably whiter &amp; my gums look pink and healthy.  I haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;whitening setting\\&quot; but have still had excellent results.  I&#x27;m actually looking forward to my next dentist visit - I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll have lots less work!  (Amazon price was the best I found on internet and in stores.)</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I used to have the Elite Sonicare. I Love the Healthy White sonicare better. The Pro Result tooth brushes are cheaper and easier to put on to the base. It just snaps on easy. I really like the battery in the tooth brush. It is more powerful and stays powerful through several brushings in a day. I did not get the more expensive Sonicare with the ProResults brush head. I did not need all the extra brushing modes. I would most likely not take the time to use all the extra modes, so I decided to get the Healthy White which was cheaper. I Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, compact charging base, two brushing modes, and long lasting battery.  My teeth feel very clean after using this brush and it turns off automatically after two minutes of use (the recommended amount of time you should spend brushing your teeth).  Overall I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I previously had the Sonicare toothbrush that used the toothpaste packets that injected the paste through the bristles.  As many other reviewers have already written, the biggest problem with earlier versions of Sonicare&#x27;s products was the well within the brush head that collected debris and was very difficult to reach to keep it clean.    The HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush has none of those problems and has been a godsend.  I love this toothbrush!  It is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.    The best part is that it holds a charge for a very, very long time.  After fully charging the brush it has lasted for up to and longer than 3 weeks without losing power at all.  I highly recommend this offering from Sonicare and plan to purchase it again when the need arises.</li>
    <li> WOW!  I saw this toothbrush at my dentist&#x27;s office at my last visit and asked about it.  They had nothing but good things to say about this product.  I didn&#x27;t buy one then because I wanted to think it over. We had an Oral B by Braun that I thought worked just fine on my teeth.  After a few weeks of checking this out online, I decided to get one.  The first couple times of using it was so different than any toothbrush I had used.  It vibrates!  It was a weird feeling!  But, I endured and after a few days I came to look forward to brushing my teeth because they just felt so much cleaner than before.  It may sound strange, but it&#x27;s true.  I have used it now for over a month and I love this toothbrush!  I can see why my dentist recommends it!  My teeth are so much cleaner feeling than before and when they say it&#x27;ll whiten your teeth - it does!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  Simply put - I LOVE IT!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Phillips sonicare does a good job of cleaning my teeth.  It is easy to use and does not take too much space.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before, but my dental hygienist strongly recommended it. This basic Sonicare, which I bought after a lot of research on the various Sonicare models, is perfect. Its footprint on the bathroom counter is small. It took no time at all to get used to. Letting the brush do the work (no scrubbing necessary) and angling the brush against the gums as illustrated in the instructions are key. The result is outstanding. The fact that it&#x27;s also fun is an unexpected incentive to brush more regularly.</li>
    <li> this product is great and works as advertised.  cant wait to go visit the dentist to see if they notice a difference</li>
    <li> 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned. I broke the first one by stepping on it, was hella bummed. Bought the same one to replace it because I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I read all the previous reviews and decided on this one. I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for about 10 years. This one seems like it won&#x27;t allow moisture and liquid to get into the housing and battery area. So far this unit is doing a great job. I&#x27;m going to get one for my kid  too.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that I will never go back to manual brushing. If you want to keep your teeth for an entire lifetime this is the appliance to own. Everytime I use it my teeth feel like I just had a professional cleaning from my dentist. The only negative thing I can say is that Sonicare could do better by adding an extra brush with the unit. One brush only comes with the unit and it puts the buyer in the position to have to go out and buy extra brushes if you want your spouse or significant other to take advantage of power brushing. So an extra cost factor put on the buyer. It should come with two brushes to get you started. Kind of cheap on Sonicare&#x27;s part I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for a solid product investment.  I bought this for my Mom as a gift because of my favorable experience owning the same model.  I purchased mine on sale at Target, and the price on Amazon was just as good as that.  That said, if you want a perfect Sonicare model, I think this is the one!  My first Sonicare lasted for over 10 years! I would just replace the brush when needed, so hopefully these newer models last just as long.</li>
    <li> When I purchased a new brush head for my sonicare it just wobbled back and forth when I put it on, it wash&#x27;t secure at all. I contacted customer service and explained the problem. I also explained that it had been a gift last xmas and did not have a receipt. They weren&#x27;t concerned at all about my problem. No receipt, no service. They just didn&#x27;t care!!!. Too bad for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidentally, I purchased a Rival Crock Pot several years ago. It&#x27;s always worked perfectly, however, one of the handles suddenly broke off. I called the company and they sent me a brand new one. No questions asked. What a difference in companies! If you don&#x27;t have good customer service sonicare, EVENTUALLY YOU&#x27;LL HAVE NO CUSTOMERS. A sonicare for the price, is a hunk of junk that doesn&#x27;t last. My husband offered to buy me a new one, No thanks, honey, I&#x27;ll take a Waterpik</li>
    <li> The toothbrush was delivered on time and seemingly in good condition. It does not, however, vibrate as strongly as the other toothbrush I own (exact same model). I am not sure if this is something that Philips have changed (my older toothbrush is close to 8 months old). But it is slightly disappointing.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the result of using an electric tooth brush.  I have had a few different kinds in the past but this one has been the best by far.  Only issue is the device can be a little loud, which is not optimal for those early mornings when I am the first to leave for work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best toothbrush I have ever used (and most expensive too). This is the only battery powered toothbrush I have used so I might be biased.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans nicely. I don&#x27;t really use the timer beep functionality - I usually take longer that the recommended 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;i wish the replacement heads were cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. It leaves my teeth squeaky clean. After brushes my mouth feels super clean. I have noticed the color of my teeth turning whiter than before. It does make a difference when using this product. Worth the money because it can last you a long time. All you have to do is change the brushes.</li>
    <li> Really it is a good toothbrush, which surprised me. Works very well and efficiently cleans teeth. It is a good investment for those who wish to take care of teeth. You can buy with confidence, is a good deal better than oral b. Besides all, this product is dual voltage.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like an electric toothbrush,but I am a convert.My teeth feel so much cleaner and my gums have gotten healthier too!</li>
    <li> This is slim and does not grow mold inside the brush attachment like earlier models.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a whitening mode that seems to pulse differently than the standard mode.&lt;br /&gt;Both modes work really well and the battery is fantastic.  I brought it with me on a week-long vacation, came home and still have not had to charge it since i&#x27;ve been back for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic!</li>
    <li> The only thing I regret is not purchasing a Sonicare years earlier! I am no longer an electric toothbrush skeptic. This brush makes my teeth feeling very clean, almost like I just had a professional cleaning. My parents even said that my teeth looked much whiter after just two weeks of use! It&#x27;s also clean, easy to use, and pretty compact in terms of size. The only thing that takes getting used to is the splashing that occurs if you take it out of your mouth while it&#x27;s on. I just turn it off before I rinse. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As comfortable as can be for the high power it has. Looks sleek. Charger has decent size and stability. Instruciton manual has the rihg tlevle fo information.</li>
    <li> if your using a regular toothbrush you are severely missing out. I used to think electronic toothbrushes were unnecessary wastes of money, but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. since buying this toothbrush my dental hygiene has reached an excellence never before achieved. my brushing time has decreased and my teeth cleanliness has increased making this one of the best purchases i have ever made.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an older model Sonicare for which brush heads are no longer available.  After reading the other reviews, thought this one sounded like a good one and the price on Amazon is much better than other places I checked.  I really like this toothbrush.  It works a bit differently than my old one, but my teeth feel really clean and the toothbrush is much easier to keep clean.  I am so glad I purchased this one.</li>
    <li> I had an Oral B electric but the holes in the brush head irritated my lower lip when it came in contact. The Sonicare brush head doesn&#x27;t have any holes &amp; I like it much better.</li>
    <li> I replaced my broken Oral B toothbrush with this one after friends told me Sonicare was better.  It&#x27;s true.  The Oral B brush is like a wooden roller coaster:  noisy and clackety.  It gets the job done, I guess, but crudely.  Like brushing your teeth with a jackhammer.  Philips Sonicare feels like a professional tool, and my teeth feel cleaner and seem whiter.  I love the &amp;#34;Clean &amp; White&amp;#34; cycle, which has an extra 30 seconds at the end (divided into two 15-second intervals) during which to focus on the front top and bottom teeth.  And the fact that the brush turns off after the cycle sets a definite limit.  You know you&#x27;ve done what the dentist recommends once the brush turns off.  Brushing with the Oral B was uncomfortable and stressful, since I felt like my teeth and gums were battered but needed extra brushing to get really clean.  The Sonicare, on the other hand, has me looking forward to brushing, since the process is comfortable and efficient.  Another plus is that the charger on this model is very compact.  I don&#x27;t want or need a bulky uv sterilizer or storage unit for other brush heads.  This charger has a small area on which you may store other heads, but it&#x27;s unobtrusive.  I am so happy with my purchase.  I highly recommend the Sonicare HealthyWhite, especially if you&#x27;re tired of your Oral B.</li>
    <li> Love this Toothbrush!!&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel so much cleaner and whiter - great product glad I purchased and would highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Just as an FYI only comes with 1 head if looking to share with family purchase more heads.</li>
    <li> This was exactly as it was described and I am very happy with my purchase.  The only draw back is that it needs a tooth brush cover.</li>
    <li> I have received big reviews on my semi-annual dental check up.  Since I began using this product the plague or otherwise deposits have nearly disppeared.  Further my teeth are cleaner and whiter.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my old Sonic (over 20 years).  I&#x27;m hoping to enjoy and use this one just as long.</li>
    <li> I just bought the double pack of Sonicare at Sams Club for my wife and I.  I&#x27;ve always wondered what the difference was from the 10 dollar electric toothbrush by oral B that I always buy and the Sonicare.....now I know!  After one brushing I could just feel the difference, it got between my teeth and brushed my gumline very well.  I don&#x27;t think I could go back to a manual or a cheap 10 dollar brand and actually believe that I have brushed my teeth and be satisfied.  The whitening mode is nice, it will gives you the full vibrations straight from the box and lets you know when to change sections of your mouth.  If you go to regular mode it works up the intensity over 14 brushing sessions, or so.      If you are like me and are hesitant on spending 100 on a toothbrush, this toothbrush will save you hundreds if not thousands in dental work later if you brush your teeth as you should.</li>
    <li> Even though my periodontist pointed me to this product while it was on sale, I am ecstatic with how easy it is to use and how my teeth feel AND look upon having used it for almost a month now.    I recommend it WITHOUT reservation.</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it everyday. I don&#x27;t think I could go back to a normal toothbrush</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this one as well as my older model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for two years and it&#x27;s still going strong! My teeth are cleaner and healthier than ever!</li>
    <li> I thought that I had done my homework on this product.  I had seen several reviews that said that the brush head just wobbled around, and I brushed it off.  After less than a year, it happened to me.  I had owned three Sonicare&#x27;s before this, and all had worked quite well.  Do NOT buy this brush.  It is a piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I had a great dental appointment today.  For years, I would brush my teeth (I&#x27;ve always been bad at flossing) but have horrible dental visits.  I had numerous cavities and fillings.  The hygienist would spend over an hour cleaning and another half hour lecturing me on my poor brushing technique and distinct lack of flossing.  One year, the cleaning was so involved (painful) that I left the dentist&#x27;s office with blood spots all over my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years ago I purchased Sonicare toothbrushes for my wife and I.  We haven&#x27;t looked back.  I really like the timer feature.  I get a good brushing each morning, but still don&#x27;t floss.  I noticed an immediate improvement in my first dental visit six months after starting with Sonicare.  It was shorter than usual and less painful.  Each year since, it&#x27;s gotten slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I went in for my annual check-up after approximately four years of Sonicare once per day (and still very rarely flossing).  I started the appointment at 8:00 AM and left the dentist&#x27;s office at 8:12 AM.  This included x-rays, dentist review, the dentist checking my mouth (and giving kudos), the hygienist doing a cleaning with fluoride treatment, and the hygienist ending the appointment saying \\&quot;Whatever you&#x27;re doing to take care of your teeth, keep doing it.  There was absolutely no buildup.  We don&#x27;t see that much.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This brush is like a power tool for your teeth, and if you want to understand how it compares to a manual toothbrush, it&#x27;s the same as the difference between a hand drill and an electric drill. It doesn&#x27;t push articles out from between teeth, it vibrates them out, and if you follow the instructions, holding the brush at a forty-five degree angle on the gum line, the results are way superior to a manual brush. The proof of the pudding: My checkups at the dentist show my gum line actually improving slightly which, at my age, is good news. The brush has a timer for a two-minute tooth-brushing and, since I&#x27;m a bit OCD, I keep a clock with a second hand nearby, to make sure I give thirty seconds to each quadrant of my mouth. There is a second speed for tooth brightening, but too many years of tea and coffee drinking have put my teeth beyond the powers of this brush. This feature is overstated by the company. The only problem with the brush is that for best results you need to change the brush head every three months. Three brush heads will run you twenty dollars if you find them on sale. Add that to the initial cost of the brush, and it&#x27;s considerably more expensive than manual brushing. I think it&#x27;s worth it, but I was talking to a young person about using an electric toothbrush, and he said, \\&quot;You spend WHAT to brush your teeth!?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> What gets me about this is how they have a kind of \\&quot;safety\\&quot; feature, where to turn it off you have to hold the button for like 5 seconds straight. You can just imagine these German engineers working it out. \\&quot;Well, what if a person accidentally pressed the button and the toothbrush turned off? Imagine the damage this could do! Whole teeth could end up unbrushed, and all for nothing, by accident! NO!! We must protect the consumer from this terrible risk! We can put in a 5-second delay to ensure that no one will ever accidentally turn off the toothbrush and interrupt the proper tooth-cleaning process!\\&quot;  Anyway, it&#x27;s an absurd pain in the neck. You are meant to use the toothbrush for the amount of time that the designers have deemed correct, and then it goes off. If you might want to, say, hold it under running water to clean it a bit... well, that&#x27;s 5 looooong seconds to turn it back on, and then 5 loooooong seconds to turn it back off. Just stupid, really.</li>
    <li> I have been going back and forth about buying an electric toothbrush for over a year now. I did a lot of research, and this was the one that seemed to \\&quot;come out on top\\&quot;. I received it two days ago - and I am thrilled! I feel like I just came from the dentist each time I use it! The timer is useful -- I never realized how short of a time I used to brush for with a manual toothbrush. I have sensitive teeth (due to exposed dentin from brushing too hard....this toothbrush was what my dentist recommended to stop me from brushing so hard) and I did not experience any pain/discomfort. Definitely 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This is my second sonic care and I love it.  My teeth feel like I get them professionally cleaned every time I brush.  I have noticed that sometimes it is hard to get the brush head to clean between the teeth but overall I think this was a great toothbrush for the value.  My dentist recommended sonicare over the rotary heads.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush at a great price. Easy to use and gives that just visited dentist feeling. Arrived in 6 days with free shipping. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought the identical model my gf had. she bought hers at Target and payed a little more. Hers has always had a higher vibration frequency and just cleans better. Mine does not even sound the same.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it still works just as it did over 4 years later so in that respect, I&#x27;m winning!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these a few years ago.  The brushes are both working still, but one of the charging bases has died.  The brushes work great, but need to be charged every couple of days or their performance really degrades.  I wish they were a little easier to keep clean, but they are better than other electric brushes I have owned in the past.</li>
    <li> The function and durability of these brushes is simply awesome. Perfect for healthy teeth and a quick brush. Highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This purchase was my first foray into the world of electronic toothbrushes. There are two brush modes to choose from: a 2 minute clean mode and an additional (optional) 30 second whitening mode. I usually opt for the additional whitening mode. On occasion, I find that my gums are a little sore after using it so when that happens I switch back to a regular toothbrush for a few days. My boyfriend and I share this one using different toothbrush heads with identifying color bands. There are slots to hold two toothbrush heads in addition to the actual toothbrush on the charging station so it could easily store brush heads for three people. Additional heads would have to be stored off of the charging unit if you were buying if for a family of 4 or more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my sonicare. So far no issues and I is pretty quiet. My teeth feel great. The brush heads are easy to order. I was a oral b gal before. I think I&#x27;ve made the switch.</li>
    <li> I was a bit late to the electric toothbrush party, and jumped to the cheaper competitor at first. After a few months, I decided to see what all the fuss was about with Sonicare. It is so much better than the competition. You can feel it after the first brush, as if you never knew your mouth could feel so clean.    This was the most basic model I could find, and I am very satisfied with it even without all the fancy extras that are available in other models. After a year, there are no signs of it slowing down, even with two people using it twice a day. The number of uses in between charges is impressive as well. If you haven&#x27;t tried a Sonicare, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I survived without this Sonicare. Its magic in your mouth and you will never want to use a regular toothbrush again in your LIFE!!</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace my previous Sonicare and love it just as much.  Gets my teeth really clean and I get better dental checkups when I use it.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied.  It arrived promptly and was exactly what I wanted.  I love the one-click Amazon prime speedy service.</li>
    <li> This is one of the less (or least) costly prices for this toothbrush. This newer design is way better at minimizing the schmutz that builds up on the older models where the head screws into the base. These are great brushes that, once you use, you can not live without. They are, however, fairly fragile and I&#x27;ve broken every one that I&#x27;ve had within about 2 years by dropping on the bathroom floor at some point.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user (10 years or so) of Sonicare Toothbrush and this products is excellent as well.  My dentist check-ups have always been great, and this toothbrush does an excellent job continuing the trend.</li>
    <li> Works as described. The battery is great, I charge it maybe once a month and use it once-twice a day every day. The actual brush-head also lasts for a lot longer than they say it would.</li>
    <li> The brush works grea, and my wife and I like the timing reminders.  I wish it had come with at least 1 additional brush head, though.  We bought a pack of 3 more for almost $30 at target.</li>
    <li> First time using it, I felt like I just left my dental hygienist......take a while to get used to it. Love it</li>
    <li> My mouth feels like I have just had a professional cleaning.  Paired with the ultra soft sensitive brush head, my teeth and gums are in the best condition possible.</li>
    <li> My wife had  Sonicare for the past 6 years.  Finally died.  Bought this as a  replacement.  These really keep your teeth smooth and clean and reduces time for dental cleaning at the Dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothbrush. Your teeth feel dentist clean if you use this product properly. Well worth it. I have gone through a couple in the last decade but will continue purchasing this product b</li>
    <li> I had my first Sonicare for 8 years!  Loved it. This one stopped working this week.  I ordered it last May.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy a Sonicare again, if their products are so unreliable.  I think the issue was that if you leave the brush on, moisture gets in under where it attaches and eats away at the rubber seal. It then stopped being waterproof and probably shorted out.</li>
    <li> Want that amazing feeling you get after going to the dentist to get your teeth cleaned? This is the toothbrush for you. I have sensitive gums and this doesn&#x27;t hurt them at all. Best of all my teeth feel clean throughout the day and are whiter ! BEST TOOTHBRUSH EVER!</li>
    <li> Toothbrush!  It&#x27;s like I have never brushed my teeth until now!!!  I love this thing!  I am hoping my dentist will love it too.</li>
    <li> Hope this one lasts as many years as the last one .. great product.  Some hesitation when you turn it off (sprayed myself and the mirror until I got used to that) ... charge lasts a LONG time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush daily for over 8 years now.  It&#x27;s always leaves my teeth feeling clean and has kept me away from the dentist&#x27;s drill for years.</li>
    <li> No need to upgrade to this model.  I was a very happy Sonicare user for the last 5+ years, so when my last Sonicare died I did not hesitate to replace it with a newer model.  Unfortunately, this one is a disappointment.  The &#x27;clean&#x27; mode works fine, just like my old one.  However, the power button toggles between the &#x27;clean&#x27; and &#x27;white&#x27; mode.  It also pauses the toothbrush.  Therefore, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to know what mode you&#x27;re in prior to brushing and it&#x27;s difficult to change modes while brushing.  Way too much hassle for a toothbrush.  Save your money and just go for the basic Sonicare brush.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]] which includes the UV sanitizer a the travel charger and pouch, and that was destroyed in a kind of dramatic accident. This brush is compatible with everything so I am basically using it as replacement part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is half the price, it comes only with the travel charger, only two modes for brushing and the battery power indicator only has one led that starts blinking when charge is below a certain percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend buying the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]], but if you want to expend less money this one does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is basically the same brush, which provides a DEEP and gentle cleaning experience, only that you have two programs, one for standard cleaning and the other(a bit more intense) for whitening. I miss the gum massage program, otherwise this model would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple battery indicator is more than enough as the charge lasts for a complete week of use.</li>
    <li> I had the older model - its going by HX5351 these days.  Its the one that lets the water (and whatever) down into the handle and leads to mold if not cleaned often.  This new design does not allow for that issue and the brush heads cost less.  The brush head for this new one just snaps onto a pin.  Also, on the whitening mode it is definitely more powerful.  The base for charging does seem a bit on the cheap side.  There&#x27;s this plastic piece that fits over the base and it&#x27;s for holding extra brush heads.  Appartently that it is supposed to snap in place.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to want to do that - the tolerances are off enough, here, that it just simply doesn&#x27;t happen.  In any case, it rests over the top without snapping and I don&#x27;t have anyone else using it besides me - so it&#x27;s not really an issue.  I&#x27;m imagining it probably won&#x27;t last as long as the old model as the parts moving at extreme speeds that were part of the replaceable brush head are now inside the handle.  The old handle had no moving parts - just an electromagnet that was alternating polarities rapidly to get the brush head to vibrate - so there wasn&#x27;t much that could break.  My old one has got to be around 10 years old and still works fine.  I&#x27;m just tired of trying to clean it out regularly due to the poor design and tired of paying more for brush heads.  I believe my old one came with an antimicrobial coating inside the handle and it didn&#x27;t seem to need to be cleaned as often.  My girlfriend just bought a new one of the older model (HX5351) that didn&#x27;t advertise that coating inside the handle (they make them cheaper now to save money).  Her&#x27;s seems to get dirty pretty fast compared to my old model.  If you feel like you want to spend 80 on a toothbrush - more like a hundred by the time you buy extra brush heads that you&#x27;re going to need, then this is the one to get.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve gotten one new cavity since using Sonicare.  However, I did just see 10 Oral-B toothbrushes, shrink-wrapped all together, at Sam&#x27;s for like 8 bucks.</li>
    <li> great toothbrush! My old electric toothbrush was good but only lasted about 2 yrs, over time it started to lose it&#x27;s oomph, it got slower &amp; slower and i could tell it wasn&#x27;t cleaning as well. So i bought this electric toothbrush to replace it. I love it, my only gripe is that it automatically shuts off after (2 mins i think it is) has elapsed.  My old one would vibrate to let you know, but it would stay on which i prefer. Also, it gave a cute smiley face on the digital screen on the front to show you that you had brushed long enough. I kinda miss that. but i really love how well this toothbrush cleans &amp; that is what i bought it for. My gums feel better and my teeth are squeaky clean. :)</li>
    <li> This packs a lot of punch for Sonicare products.  I have owned several and this one is a great one for the money.  I have noticed whitening in just about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> My husband is a dentist so we take teeth cleaning very seriously. We have owned several electric toothbrushes (yes, they do clean much better than regular brushes) through the years and prefer the Sonicare brand. However, they do not last very long compared to the cost. We have to replaced our toothbrushes about every 18 months because they die. This time we chose the model with fewer whistles and bells, more of a basic model, and it seems to clean just as well as the more expensive models with \\&quot;too many\\&quot; options. So far we are very happy with this brush, but ask me again next year. :)</li>
    <li> The perfect tooth brush.  Cleans 100%.  Don&#x27;t get imitation sonic brushes.  Get any of the real Phillips Sonicare! You won&#x27;t be sorry you did.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as recommended by her dentist and also ordered a three pack of the smaller heads (this unit comes with a larger head).  I&#x27;ve used a Braun Oral B for many years, and have two of them.  I thought they were great until I tried the Phillips Sonicare.  It cleans so well it absolutely puts both Brauns to shame.  We initially fought over the Phillips.....so now when I use it I always make sure to put HER head back on the unit...problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;I have no issues with this unit.....since I change the heads and replace hers twice each day it&#x27;s not a big deal. Have no problems with any build up of gunk at the base of the brush wand.  Highly recommend this electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my hygienist in NYC.  I absolutely love it.  It makes my mouth feel amazingly clean and does whiten teeth.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare electric toothbrush (first one replaced at about the two year mark because I wanted a newer model). The metal part that holds the brush head broke at the base after 2y2m of daily use. I absolutely love the product when it is working (did not have charge issues as some other reviewers noted) but I am frustrated to need a replacement this soon. Sonicare offered me 15% off a product on their site, but their prices are far higher than various retailers so it&#x27;s not worth it. Now looking into other brands...</li>
    <li> This is my second tooth brush and I decided to go electric after complaints of my dentist saying I brush too hard. I got this one with a coupon on the amazon page and saved $10 right off the bat. The tooth brush came with 1 head, the motorized handle, a stand and the power cord. The tooth brush is really easy to use and very self explanatory. Just charge it, pop a bristle on, press the button and it will activate the time that tells you when to switch quarter every 30 seconds. Do the front and then do the back of the teeth and you are good to go. It leaves a nice tingling sensation that feels good right before bed. The battery seems to last a while. I have used mine for a couple weeks at a time and It hasn&#x27;t died on me yet.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old Sonicare that I used for almost 15 years. This new one is just as good or better with a whitening cycle. Only would use Sonicare!</li>
    <li> I had an older model sonicare for a few years. Recently the battery on that one died and so I decided to pick up a new one. After doing some pretty in depth research online I came to this model. There are so many pros to this model, and so far after 3 months of use I have seen very few cons. To help illustrate my point of view, I used to have the sonicaire brush where the brush head screwed onto the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this is a much sharper looking brush. That&#x27;s really sort of useless, but I like that it looks good. The unit has a smaller charger which is great because I travel. It takes up less space on my bathroom counter, and less room in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another huge improvement is the head type. My old brush constantly grew mold on the inside. I would have to unscrew it and wash it with soap and water weekly. This new design completely alleviates that concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pulse timer is also great. If in regular mode, you get 4 pulses at 30 second intervals so you can give the same care to all of your teeth. If you have it in clean mode, you get the 4 pulses, plus you get two additional ones at 15 seconds. That allows you to give your &amp;#34;front visilble&amp;#34; teeth a little more attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that since I have been a sonicaire owner, my dentist visits have dramatically gone down. I have soft teeth prone to cavities. I used to have around 4 cavities a year filled. I am proud to say that since buying my first sonicaire, I have has NO new cavities form!! It is an absolutely worthwhile investment. That is why I rushed out to replace my old one when it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the heads are a little expensive, it&#x27;s a great investment in your dental future. We all only have one set of the chompers, better take good care of them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two generations of Sonicares previous to this one - a first generation basic model way back, and an elite 5500 (?) that got the more natural slanted shaft and got rid of awkward plastic tab behind the brush of the 1st gen.  Neither one died on me, both lasted years.    From the E-series to the R-series (710), the major upgrades seem to be:    -Cheaper, better, simpler and smaller replacement brushes.  No longer complicated screw-on affairs, the brushes just get pushed on a vibrating bolt, for lack of a better term.  There are a lot less places for disgusting gunk to build up and easier clean up.  Take much less time to switch heads, if you have to share them (or if the kids have to).  They are slightly cheaper to replace, natural as it seems a lot less complicated design.    -Charger base is smaller, same bolt on design as brush head.    -Setting for tooth whitening.  Wilder pulsing basically.    -Sleeker, smaller, more comfortable body.    I only moved from the E-series because I orignally bought it as a 2-for-1 special with a family member who eventually moved out and it only came with one base charger.  An extra (replacement) one would have cost nearly $45 with shipping + replacement brush head for at least $13, might as well buy a new set at that point.    If you have a Sonicare already, it&#x27;s probably most economical to stay with yours till it dies as none of the features are revolutionary.  Still, I probably like the brush head redesign and resulting cleanliness/lack-of-gunk the best.</li>
    <li> I received this tooth brush as a replacement. The Customer Service at Sonicare was very efficient and professional.  I am very happy with R710 HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush as it cleans my teeth like my dental hygienist without the prohibitive cost. It even reaches and cleans the hard to reach area like my wisdom teeth all the way in the back.  There is no going back to old toothbrush as I am so impressed with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The product performed as advertised and clean well, a bit on the expensive side though. I would recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. The blue streak that designates when to use a new head doesnt seem to last very long but the toothbrushes themselves work very well.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush - so much better than the original one.  I like the way the bristles are shaped to my teeth, and it really does feel like it is doing the job.  I went back to the original for a few days and realized how ineffective it felt compared to this one.And I like the setting which adds a little time to get the coffee stains off my front teeth.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day with flossing and I get great teeth cleaning checkups.  I miss this if I forget to pack it when I travel.</li>
    <li> Love it!  This model is giving me exactly what I wanted and expected.  Charge lasts a long time!  I wish the replacement heads were less expensive, though.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush on Amazon 2.5 years ago and it was great. The timing really helped me brush the recommended length, and I do think the whitening function worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint however is that it has stopped working after two and a half years of use, which seems wasteful and when it&#x27;s a $100 toothbrush seems too soon to have to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink a lot of tea so end up with a lot of teeth staining even with this toothbrush, but when it was working I did like it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a bit harsh compared to Oral-B but it is very effective in that it will get every nook and cranny of your teeth. If you are switching from a manual brush, it will feel like coming form the dentist each time.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I ordered the 710 because I thought it was the most toothbrush for the money, and boy was I right.  The box contained the handle, one brush head, an a/c charger with clip-on spare brush head holder (holds two), three color rings for identifying brush heads, and instruction/warranty info.  Sonicare offers a 2.5 year warranty, and some rebates and coupons in the kit as well. I charged the handle until the battery indicator light went solid green, installed the brush head, and turned the unit on.  The 710 is surprisingly powerful, and there are two speeds to choose from. Brushing with the Sonicare tickled at first, but I got used to it quickly.  There is a built in timer that beeps every 30 sec. and the unit turns off after two minutes.  The whitening mode uses a different vibration frequency and adds another 30 sec. to the two minute cycle.  The brush seems to clean very well, it makes my mouth feel cleaner than my old battery powered toothbrush and because it is rechargeable, I don&#x27;t have to waste money on batteries.  Sonicare has more expensive models, but those models only give you more cleaning modes and accessories. This seems to be the same handle and brush that you get with the 129.99 flex-care kit, just without the bells and whistles. If you are looking for good deal on a simple, top-quality sonic toothbrush, look no further.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing and price is good. Delivery was also really fast. It was a smooth transaction. I will definitely come back in the future</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sonicare toothbrushes for years.  While using I&#x27;ve always maintained great oral care.  I&#x27;ve never had a cavity and no gum problems.  Recently a relative gave me this toothbrush as a gift.  I replaced the head of my old sonicare that worked great for me for years to my wife and started to use this one.  After a year and a half of use I developed three cavaties and now had gum disease.  This toothbrush did very little for me in the terms of oral care.  I never had any problems with my other toothbrushes and my visits to my dentist were always short lived.  Now I&#x27;ve forked out over $600 in dental expenses because this toothbrush didn&#x27;t live up to its hype.  In addition about nine months in to owning the toothbrush it stopped working on me.  Phillips was nice enough to send me a replacement one free of charge, but it didn&#x27;t matter, it was useless like the first one.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  This is my second Sonicare in 5 years.  For a small mouth the Compact toothbrush head is the only one that can get to my back teeth properly and correctly.  If you get one that makes a continuious vibrating noise, then return it for another of the same kind and type.  It should be somewhat quite.  The Compact head is the smallest you will find anywhere!  The Children&#x27;s toothbrush heads are the same size as the adult, I bought them at Target and then returned them along with handel control unit.</li>
    <li> This is one of several sonicare brushes I have owned and I found it to be lighter than previous versions and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model did stop working about eighteen months after I purchased it but after a quick call to the number in the manual, where a person answered within one minute, they asked some questions and I had a replacement on the way.  The excellent service more than made up for the minor inconvenience of having to replace it.</li>
    <li> I have been using sonicare toothbrushes for the last 12 to 15 years. I have purchased the more expensive ones and this is the first time I bought the basic model. I find it excellent. The smaller heads of toothbrush makes it makes it easier to reach my back teeth and in a hard-to-reach areas. I read an article that stated when buying items you should think about really features you&#x27;re going to need. In other words do not over accessorize. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is considering purchasing a electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a big fan of sonicare brushes. Before I used these brushes my dental visits were always a nightmare. After switching to the electric brushes my visits to the dentist were less dramatic because my teeth were cleaner and I had less cavities needing to be filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this brushes a win-win providing excellent cleaning an extremely reasonable price. The battery life on these brushes are is years. The power in cleaning stays constant. Hope you find this helpful</li>
    <li> I bought Two of these about a year and a half ago. One of them stopped working and I contacted the Phillips SoniCare service department and they automatically sent me two brand new Phillips SoniCare toothbrushes. I was amazed at the great service from therm. I would recommend them to anyone. They definitely stand behind their product. I&#x27;m one happy customer!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush and I was skeptical about how much better it could actually be than a regular toothbrush. I went ahead and bought it since I read a lot of good things about it. In reading the directions, I scoffed at the initial setting of the toothbrush to &amp;#34;ease&amp;#34; you into using the brush.. well I quickly learned why! It&#x27;s a very different sensation than the $10 drugstore toothbrushes and took me about a week to get used to. I had some good moments drooling all over my scarf but I got the hang of it. Boy this toothbrush is making me wonder why I didn&#x27;t get something like this YEARS ago! The cleanliness of my teeth is insanely better and my teeth feel like I just paid a visit to the dentist every day. I am THRILLED with this purchase and will recommend to as many people as I can! The instructions are very clear and the initial charge lasted a long time for me.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommends Sonicare.  The Sonicare Flexcare system that I bought nany years ago (with the sanitizing box) was starting to get a bit gunky and I didn&#x27;t like the cumbersome sanitizing box, so i got this Healthy White with the Pro Results head.  The HW is slightly smaller than the old Flexcare, has an more angled head, and has a scrubbing feature.  This performs every bit as well as the Flexcare IMHO for considerably less money than I paid 6 years ago.  I don&#x27;t know whether the scrubbing feature accomplishes anything, but i use it.  Note that there&#x27;s now a newer model, the Sonicare HX6731/02 @ $99.95 on Amazon that has 3 modes if the 2 modes aren&#x27;t enough. Recommended.</li>
    <li> My mom first got me a Sonicare as a gift almost 15 years ago, and I&#x27;ve never gone back. Occasionally I have to use a regular toothbrush for some reason and I hate it. My teeth never feel nearly as clean as when I use this brush. Trips to the dentist are much shorter too. I love this toothbrush so much I&#x27;ve talked friends into it and bought a few as gifts. I buy the sensitive replacement brushes because the regular ones are a bit hard for me, but otherwise it&#x27;s great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great. Won&#x27;t ever go back to a traditional toothbrush. Recharges quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait around for it.</li>
    <li> I love this electric toothbrush.  I have been using it for many months and it works great.  I love that it beeps to tell you when to move to the next section of your mouth.  I have always had great luck with Philips electronic toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> The only toothbrush for me, will never go back to old style after this. have been using sonicare for 5 years and battery last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have had this for two years now and it just stopped working... Okay, maybe I wasn&#x27;t the most gentle with the product, I travel a lot so it may have been beat up a little bit and may have had some water damage, but it&#x27;s a toothbrush! Well, some of the lights stopped lighting up so I couldn&#x27;t tell when it was \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; as opposed to \\&quot;freshen&#x27;. And because I have a Costco supply of brush heads, I am going to order a new brush. Let&#x27;s hope this one works as well as the others...</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. I have been using it everyday for years. I love it very much, it gets my teeth nice and clean.</li>
    <li> A $100+ toothbrush needs to come with a travel case of some sort.  This product does not provide any whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I thought they were the smaller size heads but, anyway seems to be easy on my gums so far.&lt;br /&gt;Hope they make a compact size soon I have a small mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DH</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has changed the way I feel about brushing my teeth. Before this, I was using a battery powered toothbrush that I thought worked quite well. After the first cleaning with the Sonicare, I could immediately tell that my old toothbrush left much to be desired. With the Sonicare, you truly do get the &amp;#34;just left the Dentist&amp;#34; feeling every time you use it. Like others have mentioned, the first few uses do feel pretty strange, but this should not deter you from purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;When I was considering which type of Sonicare to get, I mostly considered price and what functions I thought were important. I think the HealthyWhite is a good choice because the price is reasonable for the quality of the toothbrush and it has many of the features of the higher priced products, like a 30 second timer and an extra mode.&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I both use this toothbrush. We each have our own brush head, and we use the same base. It is very easy to keep the toothbrush clean, and we have had no issues with sharing the toothbrush since the heads are quite long and make it easy to avoid getting the body dirty.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new toothbrush. It truly is amazing!</li>
    <li> Good basic brush. No bells or whistles, but does what it should. Heads are cheaper than the Elite series and the handle is smaller also. Overall, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, but the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; requires you to push the button twice every time you turn it on for a more powerful vibration.  Why would you ever use the less powerful setting?  It&#x27;s just an annoying little feature.</li>
    <li> Best investment I have ever made.  Feels like a dentist professional clean.  Whitens yoru teeth much more too.  Everyone needs one</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! Seems to clean my teeth really well! I love that it&#x27;s smaller and has two settings.</li>
    <li> My new dentist recommended this toothbrush to me. I have used a Braun electric for several years and I liked it, but this one seems to do a much better job at cleaning my teeth. It has a regular mode and an extra clean mode. The first time I used it, it tickled my mouth and  I almost quit using it. I kept on and now I love this toothbrush! I think it does a better job, especially at the gum level, of cleaning. I guess my next dental checkup will give me further analysis as to how well it works?</li>
    <li> I liked my first Sonicare so much, I purchased this one when the batteries finally quit holding a charge on the first one.  This one worked just as good as the first until I replaced the brush head. I purchased a set of three replacement brushes for over $10 each, but the first replacement would not stay on the brush and came off while using it.  After reinstallng the brush head several times, I decided it must be defective and tried a second one, with the same problem.  For the price of the replacement brush heads, I expected better.  I realized there must be a problem with the replacement brush heads, so I contacted Philips to check.  The support person told me she was not aware of a problem, and said she was authorized to send me one replacement brush head. I didn&#x27;t see what good another potentially defective brush head would do, so I declined but went on Philips website and tried to post a review similar to this one to warn people of the potential problem.  I received an email reply that my review would not be posted since it did not meet their \\&quot;guidelines\\&quot;, which I would assume means that they will not post a review with anything negative about their products.  I was disappointed with the defective brush heads (yes, the ones I purchased referenced this model on the packaging and yes, I had replaced them on the previous model several times and replaced them on this model at least once previously, so I knew how to change them) but I am more disappointed in a company that willingly misleads their customers by refusing to post an accurate, legitimate review because it highlights a potential problem with the product.</li>
    <li> Nice and works, battery charge between uses in minimal.  It has lasted a number of times before recharge was needed.  I think I will purchase another head so wife can use rather than purchasing a whole other toothbrush.</li>
    <li> good product love it can&#x27;t believe how this one device cleared my acne.  I can now go out in public.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel much cleaner with this brush than with the Oral-B rotating head design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much easier to keep clean too.</li>
    <li> Loved this gift - My granddaughter says she just loves this toothbrush and she is very particular.&lt;br /&gt;She will be taking it to law school in the fall.  Shipment was fast and packaging very good and strong.</li>
    <li> Lasted less than a year. Not worth the money. Randomly goes off. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long. Piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush as a Christmas gift and love it!  It is my first sonic brush - but I will never go back to hand brushing again!  My teeth were noticably whiter after only a week (I bleach with high priced bleaching kits as well - this is much easier with noticable improvement along the hard to bleach gum line)  I am not sure about the maintanance cost of new heads or the life on the battery - but what ever the cost the whiter teeth made it worth it for me already!  (my 7 year old has used it a time or two as well and I can see a difference in her teeth already.)</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with a Phillips Sonicare.  My first one was purchased&lt;br /&gt;about 10 years ago and it lasted over 9 years.  This replacement will probably&lt;br /&gt;be around for a long time.  It&#x27;s always good to purchase reliable products.</li>
    <li> My first sonicare toothbrush finally died after 10+ years (would no longer hold a charge) So, I tried a couple of the competitors and did not have that same superior clean feeling.  I decided to go back to a trusted friend and purchased a new design...I have not been happier since 10 years ago when I first tried a sonicare brush..they have saved me many cavities and gum problems as I gen only visit the dentist every couple of years..  WHICH is a BIG NO NO...however I do believe the brushing 3 times a day with this and listerine has helped.</li>
    <li> I had one of these units and I don&#x27;t like to share a toothbrush even with my husband (you can change heads and use the same base), so I bought one for him as well. We both love it. Holds a charge for week+ so we even take it with us on trips and don&#x27;t need to bring charger.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these for years, and it works so well, I bought another for my wife.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the other brushes. But this is a great brush! Definitely helps keep teeth clean with easy use. I have not experienced other peoples issues:&lt;br /&gt;- Restarting the brush after the 2 min is easy (not sure what other people&#x27;s problems were).&lt;br /&gt;- The liquid that some people complained about at the base station hasn&#x27;t built up for me (like someone mentioned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No real issues with it, does what it expected and does it well. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This is not a US version.  They send it to you as it is a product for Europe with different plug and they send adaptor with package!  Deceptive seller.. Shame on you!!!!</li>
    <li> It does the job. I just think it is way overpriced fold what it is. But it still works, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This thing works great, can making brushing more fun for someone that&#x27;s young.  Great quality, and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have had this for almost 3 years while im in Afghanistan and it still functions the same as day 1. When i mean TOUGH, it has traveled with me with no issues. Button use for operation is simple and the charging method is fool proof. Would I recommend this YES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. If it can handle a war zone without issue, I can safely say it will last in your household.</li>
    <li> I love the way my teeth feel after brushing, and the battery lasts a really long time, which is very convenient for travel, as well as just being generally convenient.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I switch from an Oral B to a Sonicare toothbrush, and I can really tell the difference!  The timer ensures that I tend to all of my teeth the appropriate amount.  I do find the HealthyWhite feature a little gimmicky - it just adds another 30 second cycle to the regular 2 minute cleaning, during which you&#x27;re supposed to focus on your front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are cleaner now, and hopefully my dentist and I will be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/10/2013 update&lt;br /&gt;My toothbrush has started flaking out - it seems to have a bad connection inside.  For about the past month, it began to not run as strongly, and seems to sputtter.  Over the past few days, it&#x27;s working less and less.  I&#x27;m going to have to get a new toothbrush.  I&#x27;m very disappointed, as this should have lasted longer than 5 months.</li>
    <li> My oral surgeon recommended this product after I had gum graft surgery. I previously used a spin brush that apparently damaged my sensitive gums even further. The sonic technology is not abrasive on gums, but is powerful on teeth. The vibration took me a few days to get used to, but after that it was great. I will never go back to a spin brush!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush at February 05, 2012, and it&#x27;s totally dead a week ago. It lasts only about one and half year. the reason cause the death is water leak inside the electronic circuit. I like to brush my teeth while I am taking a shower. I guess the sealing water rubber band of this device doesn&#x27;t really seal that well.</li>
    <li> My dental hygiene hasn&#x27;t been as good as it should be so bought this based on a recommendation from my dental hygienist.  My hygienist mentioned that she uses hers in the shower.  Since I shower at night, this was an easy way to make sure that I brush every night.  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t go to full vibration level until after a week or so to allow you to get used to the new sensation.  My teeth now have that fresh from the dentist clean feeling.  I can&#x27;t believe that I went this long without one.</li>
    <li> My dentist is wonderful.  She recommended this toothbrush, and I can see why.  The sonic feature makes it different than any brush I have ever owned.  It makes my mouth feel clean, like when I have just seen the dental hygienist.  The feature that whitens your teeth really works too.  I love coffee, blueberries and things that stain your teeth, but I noticed my teeth were whiter within a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go to the dentist often enough but love this toothbrush - with the sensor that tells you how long to stay within each quad plus the extra 30 seconds in the end to clean and whiten your front teeth, this toothbrush thoroughly cleans your teeth.  I think the surface that the brushhead covers is a plus over the round head of the Oral B ones.  At any rate, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase if you want clean pearly whites!  I actually use a regular toothbrush in the morning and this toothbrush at night to get a good cleaning in at least once a day.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush. Its very nice and one can be sure of cleaning his teeth properly. Well will your teeth shine after brushing? it surely depends on you and your teeth but this definetely supports you in cleaning effort. I am sure that there are other products which are either same or betterb but after using it for about two months I am happy and will not go to philips e series brush.</li>
    <li> I didnt receive this product so how can I rate it.  Wish I could write a product rating. Next time</li>
    <li> Works very well, gets our teeth very clean! Simple to use and store. We like the ability to color code the brush and is smaller than out previous sonic brush.</li>
    <li> We have been using Sonicare brushes for years and we bought this as a gift for our daughter. She loves it as much as we love ours. This brush is great to travel with as it is very compact and the battery lasts for days. Cleanest your teeth will be unless you go to the dentist!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is amazing, easily the best I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve had problems with staining for a while now, and this really helped prevent and reverse some stains I&#x27;ve had and prevented me from getting them cleaned by the dentist every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer that tells how long to brush each section is probably the best feature. Every 30 seconds, a slight beep tells you to change the brushing area (bottom front, bottom back, top front, top back). I don&#x27;t really miss any spots and clean my teeth much more thoroughly because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening stage is really cool too. It adds two 15-second periods at the end of normal cleaning to focus on the top and bottom front teeth. Definitely gives the extra oomph I need to stay white and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush cleans off easily, charges well and even travels well. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more.</li>
    <li> Never going back to regular toothbrush. Ever since I started using this my dentist thinks I&#x27;ve been listening to him and doing a much better job of brushing and flossing. Little does he know I just switched my toothbrush and actually put in less effort now.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush will give you a good report from your dentist the next time you have a cleaning!It is wonderful on the gums as well. My dentist thought I was flossing more than I actually was.</li>
    <li> I would buy it again. My wife now wants to have a toothbrush head for it! Price was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;F</li>
    <li> Have had two previous sonicare models now and decided I would spend even more.  This sonicare is great.  I love it.  My teeth and gums feel wonderful.  Need more time to tell if the whitening feature really works, though I think it does.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these 2 years ago and it came with a 2 year warranty which is nice except the battery failed exactly as soon as the warranty expired.  I&#x27;m fanatical about maintenance and for instance I have an iPod which is almost 10 years old and the battery is still good, because I always charge all my items at every chance.  There is no way to replace the battery so bewarned you are buying a 2 year toothbrush, the heads are very expensive and when you factor in the cost of a new brush every 2 years you can expect to spend 20 dollars a month on this setup.  Which leads me to think it&#x27;s overpriced and I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> Has been performing flawlessly over the last year.  I wished I had purchased an electric toothbrush years ago.  Recharges easily.</li>
    <li> The design of this brush is far better than previous models that trapped moisture, and therefore allowed the formation of mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Philips Sonicare for a few years now and was impressed by the cleaning results, but not the construction. Having used this model for three months, I can say I am very happy with both. Improvements to the design make this very difficult to damage. My previous brush had the magnetic contacts exposed which eventually started falling off, or moving out of position, impacting the performance of the brush, which along with the penetration of water, and difficulty in keeping it clean, reduced its life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush design has clearly taken those flaws into consideration and eliminated them. I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend purchasing a case too.</li>
    <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare and it is working out better than the first.  The previous model I had was the more expensive one that had more modes, but I never used the different modes anyway.  I also had an issue with that one where the internal electronics got wet through a failed oring.  I&#x27;ve had this model for a year now and it is still like new.  The previous model I also had an issue with mold growing on the oring under the brush attachment, I would scrub with bleach and it wouldn&#x27;t go away, but with this model I have had no such problems.  Brushing 2-3 times a day and I still only need to recharge the brush maybe every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> nothing  .it is really good  i will go on buying things from this company  so awosome i love it good luck</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd. After about a year the vibrator kills itself. Just can&#x27;t take the shaking. You&#x27;ll know when the brush mounting post starts to wobble like a loose tooth.</li>
    <li> Good brush second time buying the first one lasted me about 8 years and now I can&#x27;t buy or try anything else other than sonicare</li>
    <li> This toothbrush did nothing to whiten my teeth. And it didn&#x27;t give me that squeaky clean feeling at all. After using it, I felt like I needed to brush my teeth again because they didn&#x27;t feel clean. I went to the pharmacy and bought a $30 Oral B toothbrush that gave me that clean feeling right away. And it does a much better job whitening teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware that you can&#x27;t return this brush because it&#x27;s a personal hygiene item. I think it&#x27;s outrageous. I understand they can&#x27;t resell it. I think they should take it back and eat the cost. That&#x27;s what I call standing behind your product. This seller doesn&#x27;t. Neither does Amazon (very disappointing). For an item this expensive, they should definitely allow you to return it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you. Shame on the seller and Amazon.</li>
    <li> Its amazing the difference seen after only one day. I will never go back to a manual toothbrush.   I&#x27;m actually excited to go home and brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is not the first sonicare I have owned. I LOVE this toothbrush. It is easy to use and gets your teeth super clean.</li>
    <li> but, the sonic part takes some getting used to.  It&#x27;s like putting a vibrator in your mouth.  When you are tired and ready for bed, the last thing you really feel like doing is vibrating the inside of your mouth and waking yourself up.  With that said, it is \\&quot;sonic\\&quot;.  It seems to really whiten your teeth better than regular brushing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for about 3 weeks now and absolutely love it. My teeth feel so clean and it is true that they also look whiter. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend someone to buy this toothbrush!! I went to the Dentist 3 weeks ago and found out I had a cavity and pinkness in my gums. As soon as I left the Dentist office, I went and bought this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now twice a day. The pinkness in my gums is gone and my teeth are even looking whiter! If you don&#x27;t think the toothbrush is whitening your teeth enough, try using the Arm and Hammer Whitening Booster with it. Together, they do wonders!!! My teeth feels so much cleaner after using this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> As one gets older, our dentist discusses gum recession. Some say it is because we brushed our teeth too vigilantly as we were told. Others tell us this occurs with most adults as they age. The one recommendation from all dentists is to use an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the search for the best. Sonicare was recommended by my dentist, and I read the reviews on all of them. This 710 rechargeable has the best and most explicit reviews. I purchased this toothbrush, and I have been very happy with it. My teeth certainly feel very clean, the brush is soft, there is a slight stinging sensation the first few days, but that recedes. The toothbrush came with explicit directions. I have used this toothbrush for several weeks, my teeth shine, feel clean, and I am doing all that I can to keep my teeth in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-23-14</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I recently went to the dentist after years of not being able to go. The doctor told me my teeth look great for not being seen for so long. I attribute that to this tooth brush and constant flossing.  I would refer this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive teeth. On that note, be careful not to brush for too long. When I first got it I brushed for a couple cycles and I noticed my teeth getting sensitive.  Other than that this is the best tooth brush ever!</li>
    <li> Yep, you read that right. I hate brushing my teeth. Fortunately they tend to stay in good condition between dental visits but my hygienist has been nagging me to get this thing for a year now since I tend to build up plaque easily on some teeth. After she threatened me with visits every four months, I figured I better get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say you&#x27;re supposed to brush your teeth for two minutes. Heck, I&#x27;m lucky to pull thirty seconds so I didn&#x27;t know about the two minute timer thing on the sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lo and behold, I dig the way this thing feels when &amp;#34;brushing&amp;#34; my teeth. It&#x27;s like massaging your gums. You don&#x27;t really brush you just let the thing do its thing and move the bristles back and forth as they instruct you to. Man, that vibrate movement feels good! Two minutes is easily doable and my teeth feel so much cleaner afterwards. I drink a lot of coffee and my front teeth stain quite a bit. Actually, as my hygienist explained, it&#x27;s the plaque that stains, not so much the enamel. So I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing what this thing can do with the staining issue on have on a couple of front teeth that tend to get a lot of plaque build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week I can already say that I&#x27;m glad I made this investment. Afterall, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than dental work or having to go to the dentist more often.</li>
    <li> I am writing a review for this (we bought this back in June 2013) This is the second Philips Sonicare toothbrush we have been through.  Both times the charger quit working just outside of the 2 year warranty.  So disappointed.  Love the way it cleans our teeth but for the price I wish it would last longer.</li>
    <li> Does a great job for keeping up with the periodontal work, making the work of your peridontist only necessary once.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how great my smile is when I know my teeth are clean and white. Best tooth brush to use to keep periodontal disease at bay.</li>
    <li> When my Rotadent finally gave up the ghost after TWELVE years of service, I was skeptical about changing brands.  My dentist recommended the Sonicare very highly, so I decided to give it a try.  I LOVE it!  It is so much easier to use than a rotating head, and my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just come from a professional cleaning.  I was so impressed the first time I used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered higher-end models, but how many ways do you really need your toothbrush to vibrate?  C&#x27;mon.  This one has two settings, which is plenty in my opinion.  The first setting is 2 minutes, and there is an indicator every 30 seconds so you can brush each &#x27;quadrant&#x27; of your teeth for equal amounts of time.  That sounded a little juvenile to me, but I have found that I really like it.  It keeps me from rushing through my brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second &#x27;whitening&#x27; setting is 2.5 minutes.  The first 2 minutes are just like the first setting, with the indicator, then it does two 15-second segments that have a different vibrations.  You are supposed to use those to do your front teeth, top and bottom.  I use the first one for my front teeth, and the last 15 seconds for my tongue and palate.  Works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is super easy to use, and I love that the heads have covers and fit on the stand.  For the Amazon price, I was able to get two brushes for the price of what I would have paid at the dentist&#x27;s office - one for my bathroom, and one for the kids.  I also ordered a pack of extra heads.  Now everyone has their own head, and we share the two handles.  We all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other models with more settings, but, like I said, for the price, this has all you need to brush your teeth.  Some models have a sensitive setting, which I leaned toward because I have an area of my gums that gets extremely sore.  However, I have not had any problems with this brush irritating my gums, and they have actually been MUCH better since I started using it.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay extra for features you don&#x27;t need.  Save your money for replacement heads, because they aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m VERY happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy to use, works well. Would be nice to have a place to store the cap. Also would be nice to be able to switch on the whitening mode without having to cycle through the two minute regular mode.</li>
    <li> We use to use Oral-B toothbrushes and our dentist recommended that we switch to Sonicare. After reading the reviews that tended to rank the Oral-B as high as the Sonicare, I had trouble justifying the cost, but the dentist was instant. The difference between the Sonicare and the Oral-B are like the difference between day and night. The Sonicare no only has a harder scrubbing action, it actually forces water between your teeth. My teeth got noticeably whiter within a week of receiving it. It is miles ahead of the Oral-B in cleaning.. getting junk off my teeth that the Oral-B wouldn&#x27;t touch. Truly miles above the Oral-B (and I was a huge Oral-B fan). One suggestion: I would let the toothbrush do the work.. it is so strong that I fear that it could take enamel off (although I am not a dentist).&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that when it died after 25 months, I called Philips and they are actually replacing it for free even though it is well out of warranty. That&#x27;s what I call customer service!</li>
    <li> I am SO happy with Philips as a company because they give superior customer service.  I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare for a few years now, and I absolutely love it!  Every time I go to the dentist for a check-up or cleaning, he raves about how awesome my teeth are looking!  However, the brush handle started to rub off a few months ago, so I contacted Philips.  After giving them my brush&#x27;s serial number, they determined it was still under warranty as I registered it when I received it (do this with any of their products!).  Within two weeks, they sent me a whole new brush WITH the sanitizing system, something I hadn&#x27;t purchased in the first place!  Amazing customer service!  I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend purchasing any of their products!</li>
    <li> I wore out my first one.  My dentist says I doing a good job since using it.  three more word?</li>
    <li> Awesome. On my second one. My first socicare lasted for a long time. Comfortable in the hand, easy to use, leaves teeth/mouth feeling clean/good.</li>
    <li> The best was also a Phillips Sonicare but they don&#x27;t make that model anymore. I would highly recommend this toot hbrush to anyone</li>
    <li> Paying that amount for a toothbrush, I thought I would get the different modes specific to cleaning gums as it is in the description as well, but it does not.</li>
    <li> I recently upgraded to this brush and am now kicking myself for waiting so long to do so!  This brush truly makes you feel like you&#x27;ve just walked out of the dentist office, every time you brush!</li>
    <li> I have owned this toothbrush for nearly a year with no problems. The nice thing about the lithium battery is you can leave the toothbrush on the charger after each use, similar to a landline telephone. However, I only put the toothbrush on the charger when the battery light flashes, indicating the battery level is below 50 percent. The battery light will flash yellow if it is below 5 (or 10) percent. There is no need to drain the battery before recharging; it can be recharged at any time.    There has been no problems with the brush heads. After each use, I remove the brush head to wash the inside and outside. The brush head has never accidentally popped out of the handle. The only thing I do not like is the shape of the bristles. I would have preferred flatter contour.    I use to own an inexpensive Oral-B toothbrush with a round brush head. I cannot tell which does a better job of brushing. As long as you brush daily, any toothbrush will do the job. I replaced my 6-years-old Oral-B toothbrush with the Sonicare because of the lithium-ion battery and longer battery life.</li>
    <li> My son and I used the Sonicare brushes for years and loved them.  I could not believe how clean my teeth were even though I always brushed and believed I was caring for my teeth.  Our original units are still going strong (with third set of brushes).  When they give out, I will repurchase the Sonicare unit again.  FYI:  Our units have the pop-on brushes, not the older screw-on brushes.</li>
    <li> A big step up from a regular toothbrush.  I am not good at brushing my teeth, this gets more done in a shorter time.</li>
    <li> Could someone please help confirm with your purchase, check the bottom of the handle, is it 6711 or 6710? Mine is 6710. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Based on my on-line reviews, I decided that the Philips Sonicare best met my needs and budget. After the initial &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; and figuring out the best way to operate it, I found it easy to use and manipulate. I found that using a small hand mirror when brushing keeps most of the inevitable &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; on the hand mirror and not on my wall mirror.  I am actually brushing longer now as I found brushing to actually be &amp;#34;fun.&amp;#34; The bristles feel really good massaging my gums and I feel like I have had a thorough brushing when done. Also, the telephone support was good when I called with a question about order additional brush heads.</li>
    <li> This version of sonicare is easy to hold and use.  The grip is just right and more like a normal toothbrush. So far I have no negatives.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t put a price on dental care. You use your teeth everyday to eat.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately the Philips Sonic care isn&#x27;t very expensive. It a little premium up front but it a very effective tool in keeping your teeth/gums nice and healthy. Everyday I brushed my teeth with the sonic care I get the polished teeth feeling and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I also notice 2-3 shade whiter after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and clean. Works 4-5 days with normal use in between charge. Easily portable.</li>
    <li> I had to keep cleaning my old model because water got in the inside of the toothbrush.  Now with the redesign I have no problems.</li>
    <li> Bought the Phillips Sonicare in December of 2102, it has stopped vibrating like it did or should. Out of warranty. One year and eight months doesn&#x27;t seem very long. I had a Braun that was still working when I replaced it with the Phillips and it was over ten years old!! Checked with Phillips, apparently it is under warranty. They are sending me another one, hopefully it will last. Stay tuned!</li>
    <li> I am giving one to my sister soon.blah blah blah blah. Yada yada so on and so forth what more can I say.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. My teeth are more clean than if done by hand. I just hope it doesn&#x27;t break on me soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for about 15 years.  This is my third, and favorite by far!  It is light, but not cheezy, and quite powerful.  The charging post it sits on does not seem to be a problem.  I am kind of a clod, and I haven&#x27;t managed to knock it over yet!  Very easy to keep clean, also.  The extra clean feature does seem to work, I wish I had taken pictures to be sure.  I bought this after a cleaning/checkup, where it was discovered I had three cavities!  The first dental work I&#x27;ve had to have since I was 16!  I attribute this to the fact that I killed my last Sonicare...was on vacation and forgot my charger...ran it out of battery and it wouldn&#x27;t charge up again.  I wasn&#x27;t able to afford a new one at the time...so I ended up with cavities!  I did use my boyfriend&#x27;s Braun Oral B for awhile, but didn&#x27;t care for it.  It seemed way too mechanical to me, and not as effective.  The main thing about the Sonicare is that it feels good, and encourages me to brush.  My teeth feel so smooth and nice afterward, I feel like doing my own annoying Pearl Drops commercial!  Got a great deal on Amazon as well, $89.  I haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere else for under $100.</li>
    <li> I use tis product to brush my teeth. Haven&#x27;t tried it on anything else. Compared to a,hand brush it is suoerior..Don&#x27;t be impatient with the vibrations- you&#x27;ll get used to them soon. I especially like the extra 30 seconds to super clean difficult areas.The quality of these brushes is superior to any so far..</li>
    <li> I had an old Sonicare that finally died after about 12 years of use.  The HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush is sooo much better.  It&#x27;s lighter and the heads are smaller.  I recently took it on a 3 day trip and didn&#x27;t bring the charger.  It handled it without a problem.  I haven&#x27;t dropped it yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how it will fare when smacking the tile floor.  I just keep it elevated away from little kids&#x27; hands!</li>
    <li> Died within eleven months. This seems to be a trend with these.</li>
    <li> use it daily. preferred by my dentist</li>
    <li> This is my fourth unit, and everyone has worked great. Only issue is, since Sonic Care was taken over by Phillips the price has gone up and the options have gone down.</li>
    <li> I will NEVER use any other toothbrush ever again. This this makes your gums feel amazing and your teeth clean!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase, I did my research to find which brand and model I wanted and what I came up with is this one. All the reviews were good and everyone that purchased it liked it. Once I started using I noticed a difference almost immediately with my mouth feeling refreshed. After a couple of weeks I started noticing my teeth were becoming whiter. After a month most of my stains were removed.</li>
    <li> Replace old one because it broke, then I saw a cheaper price at Sam&#x27;s club.  Oh well, I will remember next time.</li>
    <li> I now know I have clean teeth.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this sonicare toothbrush on the recommendation of my dentist, who has done some great work on my teeth, my TMJ issues and is a generally tremendous person whom I am friends with outside of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn&#x27;t say get THIS model, just to get one since I am a terribly inconsistent flosser (read: not really much at all, like ever).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it 2 days after my cleaning.  Once it arrived I was pretty psyched to see if i noticed a difference from my manual oral b toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for 7 weeks, I have to say I believe my dentist.  My teeth feel pretty darn close to how they felt when I left his office weeks ago. It takes a little getting used to, especially if (and when) it buzzes the surrounding teeth.  the timer is great, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m brushing longer (which may be part of why my teeth are cleaner.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used to use a dental pick between my bottom front teeth to scrape out tartar build up each week.  Now that I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush, there is virtually zero between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement brushes are pretty expensive, so is the toothbrush itself.  I&#x27;m expecting it to pay off in the long run with better oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know good oral health is a good thing and is related to overall general health...so,  I&#x27;m expecting it to pay off in the long run beyond just cleaner teeth and better gumline.  If you have the cash, this is worth it.  I think this particular model is a good value to feature ratio.</li>
    <li> My mouth feels like the mouth I always wanted to have...clean....fresh.....little to no morning breath.  Who wants morning breath?  Especially the kind that YOU can&#x27;t even take yourself....its so bad YOU gotta RUN...FLY to the bathroom to scrub that mouth to get rid of the hideous, HORRID smells coming from your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS little beauty takes care of all that.  Try brushing with D.E. (Diatomaceous Earth) for a few days first and see how you like your mouth then. Heheheheeee.  It&#x27;s good to brush with D.E. in the shower before you take your shower so if the toothbrush comes out of your mouth...which it will at times.....D.E. will spray on your shower surfaces and you instead of all over your clean mirror, sink etc. You can then shower and get any D.E. off of you.</li>
    <li> After owning several other brand name electric toothbrushes from Oral-B/Braun, this one tops them all at getting your teeth their whitest. The brush head vibrates at a rapid speed, which took a little getting used to the different feeling, but it clearly gives the best result.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare brushes for quite a few years and am pleased by their products.</li>
    <li> Mine stopped charging in less than 1 year. I purchased it Nov. 30 2012, and on Nov 5, 2013, it stopped charging. May want to try a different style, or maybe mine was a dud. My last Sonicare toothbrush lasted over 4 years!</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicaire for over 10 years and was happy until this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The amount of noise and vibration distributed from this device is not only disturbing but questionable if it truly a &amp;#34;real Sonicaire&amp;#34; device?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is the cause but, the most recent purchases have been from the secondary market where you get a discount because it has been either returned or refurbished.........the 5 % discount was not worth the aggravation.&lt;br /&gt;From now on, I will only buy the new items from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush!  Helps remove plaque.  Hold charge over a week when traveling without charger.</li>
    <li> I had my Sonicare for about two years before it failed; the top metal piece became extra loose and stopped moving the toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and after charging it can last very long if brush teeth twice a day. The brush head is quite soft, haven&#x27;t try other brush head yet but i feel this one is already good. For the whitening part i didnot experience much yet, i guess it takes time. Overall, it is a great brush and i love it!</li>
    <li> My first, older style, Sonicare lasted a full three years.  In under a year this new one failed internally so the head just wobbles around. I thought it should still be under warranty but apparently not.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s easier to handle and I&#x27;m enjoying the 30 second interval reminders.  My teeth really do feel cleaner!</li>
    <li> Good news - This does a fabulous job with in keeping teeth and gums healthy. We have bought many, many over theyears for various family members.&lt;br /&gt;Bad news - it needs to be replaced more often than i would like, so i buy the cheapest model, not one with lots of special features. The Phillips Sonocare people are not good about replacing defective toothbrushes under warranty. One that i bought at Duane Reade failed shortly after i bought it and although i had the receipt, Phillips refused to replaceit because they said the serial number on the unit showed it had been manufactured more than a year before.  It was a small local Duane Reade and probably sat on the shelf for a long time. The next time one failed, i had bought it at Amazon and had very clear proof - also it was a toothbrush that was recently manufactured. I got my replacement without much fuss. I think getting it through Amazon made it easier for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent device to clean teeth. Every time I use it, feels like teeth were professionally cleaned at the dentist ooffice</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my husband, who was skeptical when I got one years ago.  Now, after several unpleasant dental procedures, he&#x27;s finally decided it might be a good idea.  He says he likes that his teeth feel so much cleaner after using this brush.  Our dental hygienist agrees!</li>
    <li> It worked well and just completely stopped working. i tried everything from trying different outlets etc but it still doesnt charge. whats even more frustrating is that it stopped working on august 16th. the return windows ended on the 15th. ridiculous</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush it makes my teeth feel after the dentist clean. However I feel like the timer on it doesn&#x27;t give me Enough time. So I usually end up using the timer for two minutes on the bottom set and two minutes on the top set. Other than that its great.</li>
    <li> Breaks after one year.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of an electric toothbrush in many years,  as I had never liked the older (20+ years) models. But the dental hygienist suggested its use to prevent gum disease, etc. This model is very  slim, takes up little space on your counter and is very easy to use.  I like the design of the toothbrush head too, as it gets to every tooth. Shuts off after two minutes of brushing which is helpful.</li>
    <li> Great product, not clunky like some other Sonicare toothbrushes.  Sort of wish it had come with an extra head, but for the price (lowest I could find), I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare since they originally hit the market.  They last forever.  My Elite died after many good years and I replaced it with this one which I think is even better.  It took me awhile to decide which one to buy as the choices were overwhelming.  I went back to a manual brush in the interim and my teeth never really felt clean.  My gums bleed probably secondary to the start of perio disease.  After several days of use the bleeding stopped and my teeth felt like I&#x27;d just been to the hygentist. At the time I bought this the best price was here.  The same goes for the Clarisonic skinbrush.  Your skin will never be so clean.  Same technology.</li>
    <li> It feels better than I thought it would. I&#x27;ve had it for a week and it definitely seems worth the money so far. My teeth feel much cleaner like they do when I get them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean. I love the timer one it and the battery is outstanding. It&#x27;s been my first experience with an electric toothbrush and I wish I had switched long ago.</li>
    <li> my first sonicare toothbrush was an elite 1500 series number that i loved from the moment i first used it.  it lasted 7 (yes, seven) years; while i tried to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; for something less costly when it at last died, the lure of the great \\&quot;cleanth\\&quot; that is part of the sonicare experience was too great to resist.  i even tried my \\&quot;old school\\&quot; regular manual toothbrush....yuck.  not clean enough!  i read many reviews of the new generation sonicare products, and decided that i would keep it simple and skip the sanitizers and multi-modes offered.      the HealthyWhite series is easy to figure out how to use and it works, all the time.  it&#x27;s easy to keep clean, lightweight, relatively quiet, and i&#x27;m relieved to no longer have to &#x27;dismantle&#x27; the brush head to dry out the inside of the handle...  i really like the soft grip feature coupled with an easy-to-hold shape...makes that \\&quot;fingertip grip\\&quot; that is so important w/ sonicare brushes quite simple to maintain.  my one regret in life is i didn&#x27;t take better care of my teeth early on. using my sonicare HealthyWhite makes me feel as if i&#x27;m doing the best with what i have, and am making an authentic effort to maintain optimum oral health.  best.toothbrush.ever.</li>
    <li> At first I was a little hesitant to pay $75 for a toothbrush. And that is the best price I have found anywhere, in stores I have seen this toothbrush selling for about $100.    I started reading reviews and decided to go with the Sonicare HealthyWhite. It is so worth it. It is true that you get what you pay for and there is really no comparison with the cheap battery operated ones. My teeth feel incredibly clean.</li>
    <li> When my old Sonicare bit the dust I tried out an electronic toothbrush from the Oral-B Smartcare Series.  It was a bad experience all around but luckily they offer a 60 day challenge to return used brushes.  I immediately purchased this Sonicare because I now knew that they are the only brush for me.  The reviews out are there are clearly divided (Oral-B v. Sonicare) but my advise to users who are looking for a replacement...if you&#x27;re happy with the brand you had, stick with it.  For me, Sonicare is the only brush I&#x27;ll buy from now on.  Their smooth and sonic vibration can&#x27;t be replicated and this new slimmer design takes up less space than my old Sonicare.  I&#x27;m also very pleased they changed the brush head design so there is no more gross build-up on the head and in the handle.  While I wished I never let myself go through the hassle of trying out the Oral-B I can now safely say I&#x27;m a Sonicare-only user.</li>
    <li> Very happy in switching to this toothbrush.  I have use spin brushes in the past, but there is no comparison.  The replacement brush heads for the sonicare are ridiculously expensive, but my teeth have never felt better.  No issues with quality or battery life.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush did great work in making my teeth feel cleaner. Between this and flossing, my sensitivity has gone away totally.</li>
    <li> Teeth are so white they and shiny and my breath is always amazing. Very good for reaching the difficult areas</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Sonicare Electric Toothbrush.  I truly believe this has kept me from getting cavities for years.  Along with rinsing my mouth wiht Hydrogen Peroxide for a minute before brushing - my teeth are WHITE and the little bubbles make an amazing fresh and clean feeling in my mouth.  Try it - You&#x27;ll LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have now gone through my second Sonicare toothbrush. The first one (original model) lasted about four years before breaking. I bought this one last summer (2013) and it is completely unusable now (September 2014).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES- it is a great toothbrush and it works great, however IT WILL BREAK. All the positive reviews are people who have only been using it for a few months. PLEASE LOOK AT THE 1 STAR REVIEWS. We are not lying-  IT WILL BREAK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a huge expense to replace every year. I was just on the phone with customer service and they will not replace it because it is 1 month out of warranty- unbelievable. They offered a 15% off coupon for a brand new one. YEAH RIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem specifically is that the metal vibrating piece on the main toothbrush is supposed to vibrate back and forth. Now it is completely loose and is free to rotate 360 degrees. So when powered on the toothbrush head just shakes all over the place rather than vibrating the brush bristles for a teeth cleaning. It doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth anymore and it is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID unless you are willing to replace every year.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not claimed as watertight product. My sonicare lasts for 2 years then died. I found moisture and rust inside. It worked very well once it works.</li>
    <li> Works great !  Love the 5 settings. The &amp;#34;Refresh&amp;#34; is my best. My dentist says our gum lines have improved.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT AND PRICE</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. Was kicking myself for spending so much on a toothbrush but it has certainly paid off. Makes my teeth feel super clean. And the whole family has heads for it. Well worth the expense in the long run.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model of a Sonicare toothbrush.  Older model was bigger, heavier, and allowed crud to build up between the brush head and base - making for unpleasant surprises when you changed brush heads!  This model has none of those problems.</li>
    <li> While this brush worked, it was great. I used it once daily (am). I bought it 07/15/2011, it died in 12/2013. Not sure I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
    <li> This is an awsome toothbrush and I recommend it to all.  I replaced a more complicated model but this one has all the features I need.</li>
    <li> Dentists over the years always recommended this product to me, but I hesitated to buy it based on the price and the fact that I thought they were just peddling products.  At the time, this toothbrush was $150.  This fall, I finally decided to take the jump, in a quest for cleaner looking teeth and fresher breath.  I was happy to see that the $70 product received just as good reviews as the more expensive one, so I chose that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been disappointed.  It does a very thorough job at cleaning.  I like the timer function where it buzzes to let you know to move onto a different quadrant of your mouth.  All these years, I mainly focused on the front of my teeth and tops of my molars.  I never really thought to brush the back sides of my teeth, and definitely was not doing it for the full 2-3 minutes.  This brush really promotes that kind of diligence.  Also, it seems to spray water between the teeth, and is very good at getting up plaque deposits.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that I never have that clean mouth feel after using it the way I do when I use a regular brush.  I think it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using it so long that the toothpaste wears out and all of the nasties get unlodged.  So I just follow-up with mouthwash and am good to go.</li>
    <li> This is superior to any regular manual toothbrush. My dentist always comments on what a great job I do brushing my teeth. I have only had one other electric toothbrush, which was a braun that died after 10 years. Can&#x27;t really compare with multiple brands, but sonicare does an equally great job as my old electric and is lighter weight.</li>
    <li> My dentist used to chide me for not flossing, but since I started using this amazing toothbrush, he has completely overlooked it, which I think is due to the Sonicare. It keeps your teeth healthy without flossing. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  If you take care of this toothbrush this product will last a long time.  It makes your teeth feel really clean and your mouth really fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> ALL of Philips products are junk, when they break down they pretty much tell you that&#x27;s to bad don&#x27;t buy anything from this JUNK creating company</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush, it makes my teeth feel really clean. But i would prefer a longer setting for brushing--two minutes isn&#x27;t really enough. It&#x27;s fine, I just turn it on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could be better:&lt;br /&gt;The cord for the charger should be a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the back of the head had something to clean the inside of the cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads are expensive.</li>
    <li> Does this type of brush typically only last a year? I have bought 2 of this brand 2 years in a row. Motor just stops after a year.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush because it gives you that &#x27;just got back from the dentist&#x27; clean mouth feel. My teeth look great and my gums look healthy. It charges super quick. I actually don&#x27;t use the heads sold by Phillips because the generic ones are so much cheaper and I figure that I paid a lot for the motor so I can get away with cheaper bristles. I recommend checking out ebay for some generic heads. They work just as well.</li>
    <li> the toothbrush itself is great.  long battery life, quality built.  Very comfortable and designed well.  I would give it 5 stars, but the brush heads are supposed to last 3 months.  Mine have been lasting hardly 2 months and that is brushing twice a day.</li>
    <li> I used to own an older Sonicare and had it for 5 yrs. I felt the same about it, nothing cleaned better. This new design is better than the old and holds a charge longer. I would spend the extra money for sure on this new slim design as opposed to the screw on brush head style they still sell.     The screw on type heads are almost the same $$ for replacement as the Pro, and it gets really nasty under the screw cap even though it looks clean on the outside. This Pro head style is a bit too small for me, but its purposely designed that way to get to hard to reach areas. Also with the Pro Head, there are no areas that gunk can get trapped under and it pulls on and off in a snap. So the Pro head is far superior.     No need to buy there top of the line unit as this unit gives you an identical result, but with less accessories and a couple less bells and whistles you&#x27;ll never need. It does not have the battery meter but it lasts for 3 weeks fully charged according to the manual.     You literally end up with a dental cleaning result after brushing. You can see and feel the difference after just one use. My teeth are whiter and cleaner. I like the Sonicare over the Oral B because the harmonic vibration action also flosses your teeth while cleaning. The Oral-B spins and does not get in between like the Sonicare does. Not to mention I hate flossing. The Oral-B is also much harsher on your teeth and gums and the brush is much stiffer. I have tried both and hated the Oral-b.      While I was in limbo researching the different new Sonicare models when my old battery died, I used the Colgate Spin from Sams. Although Colgate is better than a normal brush, it is far inferior to the Sonicare. A night and day difference. 70 bucks and free shipping, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush.  I love the way it cleans my teeth.  Also, this model is so much easier to keep clean that the old ones.  The one thing that baffles me is the expense of the replacement brushes.  It seems pretty steep for a little brush.  Also if you went by the recommendation of when to replace the brush, based on the color change you&#x27;d get about three weeks out of a brush, making it a very expensive tool.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 11/11/15  (original review below):  Toothbrush worked great until it stopped charging. Called Sonicare and it turns out the toothbrush was still under warranty a little over 2 years since purchase. (I had assumed it wasn&#x27;t and put off calling them until I was nailed by my dentist for using a manual toothbrush.)  Sonicare offered great customer service and will be replacing it with a newer model since they no longer have this one in stock. A relief for me since I have a large unopened pack of brush heads and was reluctant to spend another $100 on a toothbrush so soon again!  Original review:  My dental hygienist was strongly recommending that I buy an electric toothbrush and I finally listened. She suggested a Sonicare because the brush head is smaller. I&#x27;ve used this for several months now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The battery lasts several weeks without charging. And the brush gives a subtle sound vibration when the 30 seconds are up for each mouth quadrant.  Based on other reviews, I bought an extra set of the soft sensitive brush heads. But the original ones that came with the toothbrush work just fine for me.  No issues with water mildew/mold either - I rinse the brush head after each use and air dry on the charger base. Then I rinse the brush body and let it air dry by the bathroom sink. Can&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush enough! The proof was in the pudding during a recent dental cleaning.</li>
    <li> I owned a previous Sonicare which lasted at least 4 yrs. When the battery died I bought a replacement. The Healthy White was easy to recharge; the heads snapped on with a sanitary design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the motor, or something, hss become so weak that when you press the brush at all on your teeth it stops moving.  Not happy with a $100 toothbrush that lasts less than a year.</li>
    <li> I have had the sonicare elite toothbrush for about 6 years and the battery finally would no longer hold a charge. I have had excellent result with it so I decided to purchase another. I like the improved brush head design (the way it attaches to the brush, because there are two of us who use it every day, it is much easier and cleaner. Overall it does the same thing as the my old sonicare elite, but in a better package and overall design.</li>
    <li> I had several oral b toothbrushes for years and i didn&#x27;t know what i was missing out. Night and day. Please buy a Sonicare. You won&#x27;t regret it. This particular model is priced really well in comparison with the rest and it works just as fine.  Don&#x27;t spend over $100 for the other newer models you will love this!</li>
    <li> I have the start of gum disease and my Dentist recommended an electric tooth brush.  After much research i decided on this one.  It has proven effective in keeping my gums from getting worse and has even made some sections better.  This is my second one as the first one just died. would not charge of light up. it was over the warranty period.  I loved it so much I had to buy another one. Hope this one lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I had been in the market for a powered toothbrush for years, but I finally broke down and bought one for Christmas. I have always been concerned with oral health, but I had bad habits for a long time. After purchasing this I feel good about brushing my teeth. Even though it takes the same amount of time to brush manually, I feel like I am accomplishing much more in the 2:00-2:30 minutes of brushing. The Sonicare investment was all about making my teeth healthier and it certainly has, and hopefully will continue to do so.    It is a very solid product. Light weight, easy to use, small-medium form factor, a fresh battery (about a month old) lasts about a week on full charge for for 2 users (2x daily). I dock the toothbrush everyday, but due to battery life I usually do not leave the dock itself plugged in.     I was concerned with the cost, but maybe that helps with motivation (\\&quot;I paid for it. I better use it.\\&quot;).</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonic care toothbrush for over 10yrs now, my dentist thinks I am a flosser, but I dont need to floss for than 2 times a week when I use my power toothbrush. Most of the brushes have lasted a couple of years, that is expected coz I use it two time a day every day for 5mts each. So, 2yrs, that is $0.04 each time I brush my teeth. As with any rechargeable device, recharge the toothbrush only when it completely drains of charge, and charge it fully.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Sonicare for at least 15 years.  I have just recently had to replace my first one and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have the same results and great yearly dental checkups.[[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> This item works great! 100% satifaction. I bought it for my 11 year old who wears braces and I&#x27;m very impressed with the improvement in terms of cleaning ability. Great price too,</li>
    <li> Really like this, I have never had a sonicare before.  I can really tell a difference in the color of my teeth - not like you went and had them professionally bleached, but they are brighter!  I dont know much else - I have only had it about a month.  I got it for such a good price on here, I have never seen one at a store for under a hundred dollars.  I really like that it pauses at the 30 second intervals so you know to switch areas.</li>
    <li> I am not quiet sure if the price was worth this toothbrush. certainly observed whiter teeth, but feel like I could have spend less and get the same results.</li>
    <li> I love my new tooth brush.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 1 month.  This model is a lot lighter and turbo charged for extra cleaning.  Definitely worth 5 stars!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Phillips makes great toothbrushes. I only bought this new one because I lost my old one of two years (still worked perfectly at the time of its disappearance). This is an amazing toothbrush, it takes all the effort out of brushing and really does remove those microscopic stains that make teeth look dull and yellow. After using this toothbrush for only a couple of weeks I have no doubt that you will be looking in the mirror at whiter teeth and a brighter overall smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to splurge, there is a new Phillips product that includes a UV bulb (with safety box) on the charger. After you&#x27;re done brushing you put your brush head in the box and it removes 99.99% of germs - or so they say. I don&#x27;t think that this is a necessary addition as you do have to replace the brush head once in a while and (obviously) that gets rid of the germs, but if you&#x27;re a clean freak this might be the route for you.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush and worth the price! Reduces the time it takes to brush, while still getting your whole mouth cleaner and whiter.</li>
    <li> I use this toothbrush daily. I don&#x27;t have to charge it daily. It is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Combined with brushing once a day with a regular brush I have seen an improvement of my overall oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I like the two options - regular brushing and whitening brushing.  Overall does a great job, glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I went to my dentist two weeks ago and she said, \\&quot;Keep doing what you are doing.\\&quot; Best report ever.</li>
    <li> This was a great electric brush while it lasted, but that was for only 2 1/2 years. I just bought new brush heads and then it died. I&#x27;m so mad.</li>
    <li> As many other people have said before me, the product cleans well and is a good price. Battery life seems to be strong and packaging is economical.</li>
    <li> I searched at walmart first for this item and found it $20 cheaper on Amazon!  I love this toothbrush.  I have been using it for 1 month now, and my teeth are getting whiter!!!!</li>
    <li> This sonicare is a good value and has been working very well the past few weeks. The battery lasts a pretty long time and I like the normal and the whitening settings for \\&quot;extra time.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I had high hope for the power of an electric toothbrush.  I have not really been able to tell any difference between cleaning my teeth with this product and my manual toothbrush.  The only way I can say this toothbrush cleans better than the manual is that with the timer, I brush for a full two minutes.  I have not been to my dentist yet, maybe he&#x27;ll be able to tell a difference.</li>
    <li> It worked well for a year. Having multiple clean settings was great, and you can truly feel the difference when you switch from a regular tooth brush. After almost a year, it started having problems. Randomly turning on in the middle of the night, shutting off or slowing down in use. It was nice while it lasted, but I had hoped for better quality when I spent this much on a tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush but only lasts about 3 years.  This is my 3rd one.</li>
    <li> great so glad to have these inexpensive and delivered quick  thanks so much</li>
    <li> Unit failed after less than 18 months (the metal piece holding the brush just separated from the body), and FORGET about warranty service from Philips. You will grow old and die before they repair or replace it, or even acknowledge that you exist.  Aside from that, I have used Sonicare for more than a decade, and this thing vibrates and makes noise like crazy. And mine was not a sample defect, my wife has the same one, and the same complaint about excessive noise and vibration. We&#x27;re just waiting for hers to die now.  There is NO competition in this sector, which is what allows Philips to charge up to $300(!!) for a toothbrush, almost $10 each for replacement brushes, and completely ignore warranty claims. Annoying beyond words.  UPDATE: I wish to rescind the comment on Philips warranty service, and increase the number of stars to three. They stepped up, and replaced the unit, which had about two months left on its two year warranty. Sent me a slightly newer model which is working well so far. They wanted the old unit back, and paid for shipping both ways.</li>
    <li> I previously bought a Sonicare model HX6710, which has a slender handle that is easy to maneuver, and a quiet vibration.  I bought this HX6711 model (\\&quot;Healthy White\\&quot;) not realizing it was so different - its handle is much bulkier and heavier, and harder to maneuver.  The vibration seems much stronger, and sends unpleasant vibration through my whole head.  The sound is significantly louder.  I assume both models have the capability of removing plaque and keeping gums healthy.  If that is true, I can&#x27;t think of a reason anyone would want the HX6711 model.  Note that Sonicare&#x27;s website makes it virtually impossible to discern the differences between models.  My model HX6710 is also apparently a \\&quot;Healthy White\\&quot; model (even though it says \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; on the handle), so the model number matters. Philips&#x27; Sonicare website is extremely and unnecessarily confusing, using the same name (e.g. \\&quot;Healthy White\\&quot;) for these two very different models, and listing exactly the same replacement brush heads under several different names and product numbers.  This company makes some good products but seems to be trying hard to confuse consumers.</li>
    <li> It works great.The only thing I don&#x27;t like is having to push the on/off twice to turn off. I don&#x27;t need the timer.</li>
    <li> After much research I bought this toothbrush, excited about a cleaner mouth &amp; whiter teeth within 2 weeks?&lt;br /&gt;No such luck since after 2 brushings the connection between the head &amp; body shocked me!</li>
    <li> I love my new Sonicare! its amazing the difference it makes from a regular brush. Definitely worth the buy for that pretty smile :-D</li>
    <li> I never considered my teeth to be very dirty, but after having used this Sonicare, every time I am without it for a few days (hotels, travel, etc.), my mouth feels disgusting. I love the 2 minute timer, as it gives me a good idea of how to actually take excellent care of my teeth. I went to the dentist 6 months after purchasing and the hygienist told me that she was incredibly shocked at how clean and excellent my teeth are. I told her it was because of this guy right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this due to some studies I read of the correlation between poor oral hygiene and heart/general health issues. So I invested in this. Since then, I&#x27;ve told many others to buy one and I stand by it firmly.</li>
    <li> I love it. I can&#x27;t live without it. You&#x27;ll never know how clean your teeth can be until you try it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses Sonicares.  We have not had cavities for over 8 years now. I was ripping apart my gums scrubbing with a normal brush and was told I had the start of gum disease 10 years ago.  Now, I pass the gum poking evil dentist test with flying colors!  Yeah!!! Not to mention that it keeps you brushing for a whole 2 minutes with the auto stop (keeps the kids from cheating).  We had to return a few, and Philips replaced them within the warranty window.  They would stop working, I would email or chat them, and 2-3 days later I had a replacement!  Good company.  Good product.  Saved us $$$ on dental care.  We buy them from Sams or from Amazon, as we have found they have the best prices.</li>
    <li> … the product worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box was open (with a box cut over along the side) . It seemed as if other items that come in the box where removed for the  exception of the toothbrush and the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One particular thing that made me feel uneasy was that it (the box) had a CVS store tracker on it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great price, for solely receiving the toothbrush and charger  -- with along with the uneasy feeling of where did this item come from.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this model since August of 2009, so 3 years. I guess I just really wanted to be sure before I gave my opinion :) I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it and whenever it crashes on me, I&#x27;ll definitely get another Sonicare. I honestly can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s lasted so long, quite a good deal in my opinion. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting any less powerful either. I definitely have seen a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I lost the travel case unfortunately, so the last time I took a trip I just picked up a regular toothbrush that I could throw out when I left. I couldn&#x27;t stand using it, it felt strange and rough against my teeth. The sonicare is so different, it glides across your teeth. When I was done using the manual toothbrush, my teeth just felt dirty to me, and no amount of brushing was helping. I guess I&#x27;m just spoiled by the sonicare. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all in my head though, my dentist agrees that my teeth and gums have improved since I started using the sonicare. I can definitely tell that my appointments have been getting shorter then they used to be. Anyways, if you can afford to get a sonicare, it is a quality product that is worth the money. Who knows, you might even end up saving yourself some money in dental fees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative thing I will say about it is that between the cleaning head and the handle, a lot of icky stuff tends to build up. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything the company could do to fix it though, so I didn&#x27;t dock any stars. You just have to unscrew the brush and clean where it screws in. If you don&#x27;t do this, it will probably get really nasty, but at least it&#x27;s not the part that you stick in your mouth- that part stays clean.</li>
    <li> Finally broke down and bought one of these and I could not be happier.  My teeth and gums feel lots better ever since.  Why I even think I&#x27;m a happier guy because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use but I would caution anyone to put the brush in their mouth first before turning it on.  Doh!</li>
    <li> Move on to another product this is my 4 th one of this brand. Stops working after a few weeks or gets weaker.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have owned this product and have no complaints.  It is compact for travel and the price was competitive on Amazon.  I can&#x27;t use a regular toothbrush and feel like it is doing its job.  I believe it has helped my dental health as per my visits to the dentist.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  My husband and I both have one and I can tell a difference in my teeth.  The dentist even told me my teeth looked good at my last cleaning.  It is rechargeable and holds the charge well.  I gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons.  The first reason:  after a while, it gets DISGUSTING under where the head attaches to the battery part.  I have tried to stand it up, lay it flat, pull the head off for it to dry etc.  You just pull the head off and wipe - but kind of a pain.  The other reason is cost.  It is expensive to purchase and the replacement heads are expensive also.  Mine has worked over a year and so far so good.  Worth the money</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do without my Sonicare morning and night. After brushing, my mouth feels fresher and cleaner than with a regular toothbrush, and my teeth are whiter. Each person in our family now has a Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed this product it and would order again</li>
    <li> I love how clean my teeth feel.  Wish I had bought a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Warranty is 24 months, mine made it 25 months before it died.  This is my second one, the first was an older model but lasted around 4 years.  I am not sure if I will spend the money with Philips again for the quality versus price.</li>
    <li> My toothbrush head lasts two months. My mouth feels great after brushing. It really cleans well.</li>
    <li> This item was recommended by our hygenist. It is not as easy to use as previous electric toothbrush, but supposed to be excellent in removing placque.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 3 of these toothbrushes.  I will say the Philips support was excellent and they stand behind their product.  I had 3 brushes within 2.5 years fail me.  This was the first electric toothbrush I tried and was pleased.  This brush just vibrates, however, and clinical studies show no improvement in cleaning over a standard brush.  However, these same clinical studies show the Oral B to be up to 7x improvement.  I&#x27;m just learning this now after doing some research to replace my Sonicare.</li>
    <li> My favorite sonicare thus far.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at just how much more effective this tool is compared to a regular tootbrush.  I&#x27;m a total convert and will never go back.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it for so long. Brushing my teeth is  much more enjoyable, because I look forward to the way my teeth feel afterward. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for a week now and I love how clean my teeth are after brushing them. I use the cleaning mode and brush as instructed (30 seconds on upper outer teeth, 30 seconds on upper inner, 30 on lower outer, and 30 on lower inner. there&#x27;s a slightly tone change in between to remind you to switch section) and it removes tarter and plague. It does take a few days to get used to if you&#x27;ve never used a sonic brush before. It bothers me for a couple of days because the vibration and noise reminds me of dental check out, which I hate. I also love the brush head. Bristles are soft and gentle on gum. And it is small enough to get to the hare-to-reach spot in your mouth such as wisdom teeth area. I&#x27;ve tried electronic brushes before but they all made my gum bleed the first couple days of use since I have super sensitive teeth and gum. But this one did not do that at all. I also like that the brush has a small section of bristles that are deep blue. When the color of blue fades, it means it&#x27;s time to replace the brush head. I also like the charger. I can put it on my counter top and stand my brush there. I charged it before first use and it took about 2-3 hours to fully charge the brush and I haven&#x27;t needed to charge again since then. I showed my teeth to my mom after about 3 days of use and she said my teeth look brighter.</li>
    <li> After five months of daily use, this toothbrush stopped working and refused to revive.  During its short life, I enjoyed super clean teeth and it even toughened up my gums.  I won&#x27;t be ordering this model again, however, as it became obsolete in an unreasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve always had somewhat \\&quot;bleh\\&quot; teeth, lots of cavities and such, i bought this product a few days ago and i can already see results, it&#x27;s amazing. i bought mine at sams club in a two pack, but it only came with one charger (luckily you can order more on amazon) anyways, i seriously suggest this. my teeth look whiter (especially my bottom teeth close to the gums, they were getting a light yellow), my whole mouth feels incredibly cleaner, it&#x27;s just an overall plus from the cheaper electronic tooth brush i was trying.</li>
    <li> I purchased this HealthyWhite Sonicare toothbrush less than 3 weeks ago. I thought it was doing a better job than the Oral-B that I had been using for many years and today, I had my check-up and cleaning. Even the hygenist thought that my teeth were cleaner than usual. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had the Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbrush for a full two years now, and it has worked flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a reliability standpoint,  it has been completely trouble free.  The battery life has been quite good as well, as I usually can go two weeks without needing to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as functionality goes, here&#x27;s what I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Built-in timer that gives you a precise two minute brushing session, as well as the ability to add 15 second extra cleaning sessions for your front teeth, top and bottom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Really penetrates the crevices and removes stuck food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Great job at removing stains from teeth, particularly in the back of your teeth, which can sometimes be neglected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Light and easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I would mention is that the brush heads wear out rather quickly and are not exactly cheap to replace.  I would recommend the Diamond Clean heads over the Pro Results as they do a better job overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really is worth the investment.  You feel like you just left the dentist&#x27;s office every time you use it.  People really should spend the money to take care of their teeth.  You only get one set, and dental problems later in life are not worth skimping out and buying a cheap 2 dollar manual toothbrush every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product if you are looking to improve oral hygiene and want a quality device that&#x27;s reliable and works effectively.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my Phillips Sonicaire toothbrush. I had my first one for over 4 years. After it quit I&#x27;ve been without an electric toothbrush for about 2 months. I absolutely hated using a manual toothbrush. I was like a kid in a candy store when I finally got this electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years, they are the best.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare. The first one I bought from years and years ago (mid 90&#x27;s) still works even though it is old. We went overseas for a few years and I didn&#x27;t use it, so once we got back to the US I waited a few years and bought a new one to get better technology. My toddler accidentaly dropped it, so I bought the last replacement (no fault of Sonicare). The replacement lasted less than 2 years and it died. I just had to buy another one and I upgraded to the \\&quot;Philips Sonicare HX6733/70 HealthyWhite 3 Mode Premium Edition Rechargeable Toothbrush 2 Sets (2 handles, 2 brush heads, 1 Hydro Clean UV Sanitizer with Integrated Charger, 1 Travel charger, 2 Travel cases)\\&quot; so that my older son and I could have one. Hopefully these will last much longer....for the price they should...especially since the older ones lasted so long. I hope manufacturers go back to making products to last instead of making them cheaply.</li>
    <li> I bought this model to replace my FlexCare which died.  It fits on my FlexCare charger (so I can still use the sanitizer) and uses the ProResults brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as good as the FlexCare at a much lower price.</li>
    <li> Big fan of this guy. If you&#x27;re like me where you hate brushing your teeth (I dont know why, I just know that I do), this will honestly help you to brush your teeth more often.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads work well.  I bought and loved and then bought more for everybody in the family.  They all loved the sonicare.</li>
    <li> Had an Oral B before, I really like the sonicare model.  Would buy it again, and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush off and on for 10 years. Nothing compares to the clean feeling that I get from using this toothbrush.  My husband is one of those people that avoids the dentist for years at a time and never has a cavity or gum issues (I&#x27;m convinced it because of his Sonicare use).  This particular model (HealthyWhite 710) holds a charge for over 2 weeks for us.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for about 3 years and have been a huge fan. So much so that I have bought it for my whole family. However recently I noticed that the replacement toothbrush heads have gone up in price - now one head costs approximately $10!!!! Considering that it only lasts about 3 months it&#x27;s a very expensive toothbrush to run, especially if you have more than one toothbrush. Braun heads are far cheaper. What a shame PHILLIPS!!!</li>
    <li> Liked the toothbrush a lot and relied on it for two years. Or, to be precise, two years and two weeks -- which is when it died. I&#x27;m careful with machines and products, and treated it kindly. I expected a longer lifespan and will try another brand now.  Very disappointed. Two stars because it was great while it lasted.</li>
    <li> I still have all my teeth, what more do you want?</li>
    <li> Really thorough soft brushing.  I actually brush for three minutes each day -  My teeth ARE WHITER !  Great product  oh - it also used much less toothpaste!</li>
    <li> This is lower price but working good so far. They snap in easily and cost less. I love it and I will never go back to manual brushing</li>
    <li> This is the second Sonicare that I&#x27;ve owned.  The first one lasted 5 years and probably would have gone more if I wasn&#x27;t messing around with it.  I have had a couple of different electric toothbrushes and this is my favorite.  It takes one or two times to get used to the feeling (tickles my mouth at first) but once you&#x27;ve switched, you can never go back.  I have several dentist friends and they all own this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have bad teeth.  Actually never had a cavity at all in my life.  Usually I have great dental exams with little work for the dentist to do.  However, I say your body is your greatest asset and your teeth are very important for the following key reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Looks - obviously this is a give away, people like great smiles, helps with attraction big time&lt;br /&gt;2) Health - sometimes overlooked, not only cavities and bad gums, but plaque build up that may cause you to have other health problems in the mouth&lt;br /&gt;3) Financial - no one ever leaves the dental office after a root canal smiling after their wallet is emptied&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, my dentist has been recommending me to get an electric toothbrush for a long time even though my teeth are already pretty white and straight, etc.  I got this and will not go back to manual unless I have to.  This is the one to get.  My positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The ease of brushing.  No more moving my hand, wrist, arm to brush.  Just hold and let it work itself.&lt;br /&gt;2) The ease of cleaning.  For some reason (maybe how fast it is vibrating) but no toothpaste or food particles build up on the brush like manual ones.&lt;br /&gt;3) Charge.  I have only charged it once and have been brushing with it 2x a day for almost a month now.  Still haven&#x27;t charged it yet!&lt;br /&gt;4) Timer.  I like knowing how long to stay in each quadrant.  It helps with consistency and knowing you brushed the full amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;5) Whitening.  I like the 2nd setting which I use always to get that extra 30 seconds of whitening action.  My teeth are whiter than ever and they were already white to begin with.  I eat pretty clean and rarely drink coffee or tea and never drink soda.  So that may be a big reason too.&lt;br /&gt;6) Design.  Light and no issue with water leaking in and damaging components.  I mean don&#x27;t drop it in the sink or toilet but water can be used to rinse the top half easily with no worries.&lt;br /&gt;7) Cost.  I got this for $65 total.  Great buy.&lt;br /&gt;8) Brand.  Philips make great shavers and this seems to be that same quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Size.  It could have been a little lighter and narrower so I can get the back of teeth easier.&lt;br /&gt;2) Power.  I&#x27;d like to see if they can make something even more powerful but that might be dangerous haha.&lt;br /&gt;3) Cost.  I&#x27;d like to see the cost of brush heads drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:o]be that same quality  My negatives:  1) Size.  It could have been a little lighter and narrower so I can get the back of teeth easier.  2) Power.  I&#x27;d like to see if they can make something even more powerful but that might be dangerous haha.  3) Cost.  I&#x27;d like to see the cost of brush heads drop.  :o]</li>
    <li> I have went through two of these in about a year.  They work good when they do work but they don&#x27;t work too long.  I think something inside wears out after a while and then it is just a regular tooth brush that makes noise.  I&#x27;m going to try Oral B now and see how long they last.</li>
    <li> the vibrations are very uncomfortable; this unit makes something simple - brushing my teeth - into a complex and annoying ordeal.</li>
    <li> As always a good toothbrush. Bought this one because it is dual voltage and I can use it for overseas travel.  A bit on the expensive side, but then I want dual voltage.</li>
    <li> At first, it makes your mouth feel weird, but that feeling goes away after a few uses. The body is very light-weight, but still has a great battery life. I definitely feel that my teeth, gums, and mouth are cleaner and healthier than before. It has a built in timer to shutoff after so long (I think it can also time you for 30sec for each section of your teeth: top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back), but I find myself turning it back on because I&#x27;m not done yet (and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that). Money spent on this is definitely worth it. I&#x27;ll never buy a cheap imitator.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush is the best money i&#x27;ve spent on a personal hygiene product bar none.&lt;br /&gt;This leaves your teeth feeling very clean. In fact having to go back to a regular toothbrush makes your mouth feeling dirty.&lt;br /&gt;My bi-yearly appointments at my dentist have also gone a lot better, much less scraping and no cavities.&lt;br /&gt;This is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> It really makes your teeth whiter.  It is easy to use.  It is compact .  A necessity for healthy gums!</li>
    <li> The toothbrush seems to work just fine, but my husband says it didn&#x27;t come with a charger.  Luckily, this was a replacement for his (he seems to be hard on toothbrushes), so we already have a charger.  But check before you buy!</li>
    <li> I cannot live without my Sonicare, and this new one that is easy to keep clean is awsome. I like the brush better too.</li>
    <li> It leaves the same clean feel than after coming out of the dentist for the regular clean-up. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but if it lasts long enough, it should be ok.&lt;br /&gt;Extra heads are also pricey (~$30 for 3), so beware.</li>
    <li> My dad loves his new sonicare so i am happy.  He got it on x mas and hasnt stopped using it since!!</li>
    <li> The 15 second beeps are great for getting complete coverage of all sections of the mouth. I&#x27;ve haad to use my watch with previous models.</li>
    <li> I have used the Sonicare product for many years. This model was a very good replacement. I use it daily and very happy with my selection.</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these I have had over the years.  I am basically a lazy person and this toothbrush helps me do a good job of brushing my teeth with the least effort.</li>
    <li> 5 stars because it is the best! I had one that I first purchased 5 years ago and it was incredible the entire time. I purchased another brand that didn&#x27;t even come close to this product.  I love the actual design of the hand held, love how it charges and holds it&#x27;s charge for a very long time. I love that it comes with a protective toothbrush cap and I love how it makes my teeth feel and look. What I don&#x27;t like is the residue that collects at the base. That is extremely minor though considering its efficiency. Definitely recommend this product to anyone. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare tooth brushes for 5+ years now and it does so much better at cleaning my teeth I will never go back. One of our older units finally wore out so I bought this as a replacement unit. I was switching heads to use my wife&#x27;s unit which was a pain! So it is nice to have my own unit again. It works just the same as my old unit but it holds a charge. Thanks for getting it to me so quickly!</li>
    <li> Perfect present for someone.  Again, excited to find something I was looking for.  The &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; helped me with my decision as to which electric toothbrush to get as a gift for a special someone.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! Worth the money and what a great price on Amazon. I recommend this brush as I have tried others and the difference is incredible!</li>
    <li> I purchased this rechargeable electric toothbrush as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, (a certified dental assistant) and she loved it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush really cleans the teeth and massages the gums.  One cleaning and my son could tell a difference.  Worth the extra cost over regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Love the toothbrush, but every replacement brush I bought which says it is compatible with this one, doesn&#x27;t fit right. The most recent one I bought usually falls off mid brush, unless I remember to push it down hard before I start to brush.  Quite disappointing that I can&#x27;t find the right brush heads.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older version of this one. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be built as solid as the previous model ,however it  performs just as well.</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare before and I love the replacement I purchased.  It works just like the previous one that I had</li>
    <li> I get horrible plaque to the point where I own a dental tool and scrape my teeth between cleanings, not anymore, this is the first toothbrush that removes all the plague. I&#x27;ve owned the oral b spin brush and it didn&#x27;t help at all. After 3 weeks my teeth are so white just like after you a cleaning, everytime I brush it feels like I just got them professionally cleaned. I wish I would have gotten this sooner maybe I wouldn&#x27;t owe my dentist so much money.</li>
    <li> great dental checkups with these brushes, but have had problems with early death. complete your paper work it might die too early!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this toothbrush. My first failed after two years of use. Even so, I liked it enough to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the first was that after two years it suddenly stopped taking a charge from the charging stand. I tried using another charger, but that didn&#x27;t work either. My charger wasn&#x27;t the problem either; it was the toothbrush. I eventually disassembled the toothbrush and found the inside contained water and saw that the electrical parts (including the battery) had been soaked in water for what appeared to be a long time. Being that the toothbrush (any toothbrush) is exposed to water daily, it&#x27;s not a huge surprise that water found its way inside to the electrical parts, but I was still dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the two-year failure, I still give the toothbrush four stars. I like it that much. My teeth and gums feel great after using this, and when I do have to use a manual toothbrush when I travel or forget to charge this one, I really do miss the sonicare.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush! It cleans your teeth and makes you feel like you just came from the dentist office. Won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic electric tooth bush about a year and a half ago.  I had previously used Braun electric toothbrushes for several year.  Each of them lasted 3-4 years.  I decided to try something new, thus the Sonacare version with whitening capabilities.  It died with no forwarning a month ago.  I was left with several new, unused toothbrush heads that only fit Sonacare, of course, and they are not cheap.  So I ended up buying the cheapest version of Sonacare toothbrush that I could find that fit the supply of toothbrush heads.  Will return to Braun when they are used up.</li>
    <li> Very quiet and works really good. My dentist recommended this brush to us and we just love it. Works really well.</li>
    <li> What a difference from my old one.  It&#x27;s great! You will not be disappointed in this product.... .... ..... ..</li>
    <li> i wouldn&#x27;t recommend. i used it for almost 2 years and it just started to turn on by itself. i tried to open it up to clean it and now it doesn&#x27;t work and the warranty is expired. i was a loyal sonicare user but am making the switch to oral b</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush. The last time I went to the dentist, I was told my gums were receding. My co-worker recommended this brand because she had a similar issue and said it helped her dramatically. I&#x27;ve only had for about a week now, but I love how clean my mouth feels after using it. I have been getting a tingling sensation, but according to the review that should subside. We spend so much money on clothes, shoes, etc. and don&#x27;t really splurge on the things that matter. I would say our teeth matter!  It is well worth the money and I would recommended this toothbrush to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare was recommended by my dentist.  At first it tickled so much when I used it because of the intense vibration.  After about a week I got over it.  It actually makes brushing my teeth fun.  I mean it.</li>
    <li> It works.  The first couple of times of use, it feels kind of weird and I had a problem where it would make the edge of my mouth a little numb and I would drool a bit out the side, but I&#x27;ve gotten over that.  It is pricey and the replacement tips are pretty expensive as well, but if you want an electric toothbrush, this one is very good.  I&#x27;ve used other less expensive electric toothbrushes and they don&#x27;t do as good of a job and feel like they are going to fall apart in your hand after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> The battery on my previous Sonicare brush died after 8 or 9 years.  That&#x27;s not bad.  This brush seems to be as effective.  Hope its battery lasts as long.</li>
    <li> I like the feature that indicates when it is time to move to brush a different area of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I can purchase replacement heads locally.&lt;br /&gt;It has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Best buy they kept my teeth very clean.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by my dentist, I decided to try it.  My husband has been using one of these for years and I wish I had done this earlier.  My teeth feel great!</li>
    <li> This is my third Sonic and my teeth and gums are in healthy condition.  Visit the dentist once a year and I&#x27;m a senior citizen with my own teeth.</li>
    <li> O.K. - I have owned both the Oral B and now the Phillips.  The oral B cleans your teeth however, its action is much too harsh.  I owned two of them in ten years.  I finally decided when the latest one died to get a Phillips.  What a difference.  It is much gentler due to the different action of the brush.  It leaves your teeth feeling much cleaner.  (You know, when you rub your tongue over them and check - the Phillips is better).  It also leaves your mouth and breath smelling fresher.  I do not know why - but it does.  I will never buy an oral B again - the Phillips is so much better.  I wish I had changed years ago.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this.  We had an Oral B before and really liked it.  I went with Sonicare just to switch things up.  It&#x27;s pretty different than the Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Quieter&lt;br /&gt;-Sleeker looking&lt;br /&gt;-Less parts so it feels a little more sanitary, the Oral B had so many nicks and crannies that would get pretty gross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;brushing&#x27; mechanism is very different, it&#x27;s hard to explain but it feels like it has more vibration and must be used exactly as directed, otherwise the results are not as good as the Oral B.</li>
    <li> No question my teeth get so much cleaner with Sonicare than any other toothbrush I have used. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> my mouth/teeth feel fresh and clean- invigorated if you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i have noticed my teeth are more white than ever before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried another brand with the round brush and my teeth still felt dirty.  I got this on a recommendation of my hygienist and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It starts out the first week or so with a slower vibration so that you can get used to it.  It has two options.  Either the 2 min normal clean or an extra min. for extra clean.  I use the extra time to clean the roof of my mouth and tongue.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll run it again just to go over the front teeth.  I rec&#x27;d it on 4-9-13 and it said it will run for 3 wks on a charge.  I didn&#x27;t charge it until 05/04/13.  The vibration of the brush never decreased, it would just start shutting off during the 2 min. cycle. I had to learn how to brush with my mouth closed more so that the splatter stayed in and not on the mirror.  I like that the brush is more like a brush and not a circle.  It can fit behind my back teeth so much better.  I wish the replacement brushes weren&#x27;t so expensive.  I&#x27;m anxious to see if my dentist can tell a difference since I got it immediately after visiting him.</li>
    <li> Greatest invention; teeth stay healthy and wonderfully clean!  A must for every member of the family to be able to use!</li>
    <li> When I began to look into buying on of these, I was undecided about this or the other competitor. The price ranged by about 15 dollars less. After reading a though a lot of reviews, I decided to purchase this one. I was not the least bit disappointed. This tooth works like magic. It has intensive, rapid strokes, yet sensitive on the gums. To be honest, after using this I will no longer be using conventional toothbrushes. Also the battery lasts a while on a full charge. I used it for about 4 days, twice a day forgetting to put it to charge, and it kept going. I never saw a loss in strength over those 4 days. The price may throw you off at first but you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush and the second time I bought this model.  Been using them for about 15 years now and after several years the previous one just started acting up and wouldn&#x27;t charge/vibrate anymore.  Bought this as a replacement and am just as happy as I have been for yhears.</li>
    <li> This is my second toothbrush from Sonicare and the first one lasted two years, and the second one lasted a year.  Both times the battery just died and the toothbrush just stopped working altogether.  I tried to get a replacement handle from Sonicare since it was still under the warranty for the second handle.  This is why I&#x27;m giving them two stars, it&#x27;s because of their awful service in getting any replacement parts under the warranty.  Sure, you think Sonicare is a great deal because they offer a two year warranty, but what&#x27;s the point if they take their sweet time sending you, or rather, NEVER sending you the replacement part you need?  It has been a month now for me and I have contacted them four times for a replacement part.  I really don&#x27;t know what to do at this point to get my replacement handle that is still well within the two year warranty.  It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating, especially since all I seem to get from them are excuses about my order.  Is it really uncommon for them to actually fulfill a replacement order under warranty?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, beware, when you get your toothbrush.  It may last you two years, or it may last you one year.  When it works, it really is great.  But if it breaks within your warranty period, expect a really long wait to get anything from them if at all.  I&#x27;m still trying to get them to send me something, but it&#x27;s looking a bit hopeless at this point.  I&#x27;m really upset since the toothbrush and the heads are expensive, yet they are treating a loyal customer this way.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works great...my dentist says my teeth are in great condition and I attribute some of that to this magic little toothbrush. Super easy to use and your teeth will feel so wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this product. There&#x27;s not much else to say. Every time I brush my teeth, my mouth has never felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> Terrible, terrible, toothbrush. Literally died 9 months after buying it. Dead. Changed to Oral B 4000. Rated highest by Consumer Reports in 2013 and for about the same price. A long time Phillips Sonicare customer no more.</li>
    <li> I purchased this rechargeable sonic toothbrush from Walmart for $145 excluding tax on August 7, 2010.  It worked really well until early March 2013, when the battery charger gave out.  The company asked if I&#x27;d dropped it (I hadn&#x27;t), and informed me that their 2 year warranty had expired and they could not help me with my model.  They offered me a 15% discount to buy a replacement for $180.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the toothbrush worked very well while it ran, I felt that $145 was too much money to pay for an electronic device that held up for 2.5 years.  I therefore did not want to buy another Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush looks very sturdily built on the outside, but I&#x27;m not sure why I would want to purchase from this company again.  Customer service was friendly at first and became chilly quickly after we discovered the toothbrush was out of warranty.</li>
    <li> I just got it. And absolutely love it. It is as great as everybody said it is. I rinse it thoughtfully and wipe with rag every time. It is gross when people don&#x27;t keep it clean and toothpaste runs and dries on charger.</li>
    <li> I had a Brawn before, and always thought it got my teeth  clean, but it was a &amp;#34;clunker&amp;#34; compared to this one.  It is so precise, every tooth gets clean without hurting my gums.  It just humms!  My daughter has had one for 5 years and it&#x27;s still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know how good this one is, I&#x27;ll never recommend or buy any other that Philips Sonicare.  It REALLY IS the best!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my fiancée and he says its the best toothbrush he has used so far. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are still going strong. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for five months now. It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well. My previous toothbrush was a first generation OralB, which was a good brush in it&#x27;s own right. But this one performs much better in every aspect. I&#x27;ve noticed some reviews claiming this is not a powerful brush. I honestly don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase a Philips Sonicare, But shop around for replacement heads. I found there&#x27;s quite a price variance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;cleans great&lt;br /&gt;light weight&lt;br /&gt;small size&lt;br /&gt;works for small mouths, i.e. children&lt;br /&gt;maneuverable&lt;br /&gt;long battery life (between charge)&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;None so far</li>
    <li> proof positive, my first dental check-up just a month after using my new Sonicare proved it really does make a difference.  Much less plaque than in the past.</li>
    <li> This is my first Sonicare. I am a fan. The brush is comfortable in my hand and the cleaning is great!</li>
    <li> I had to replace the last one because the battery went bad after about 18months, the one previously last about 5 years. Hope I have better luck with this one if not I&#x27;m going to another brand. But they are far better than doing that manual thing.</li>
    <li> LIKE A DENTAL CLEANING EVERY TIME YOU BRUSH...&lt;br /&gt;GAVE IT TO BOTH COLLEGE AGE KIDS BUT YOU MUST&lt;br /&gt;REGISTER IT ON THE WEBSITE IN CASE YOU DROP IT&lt;br /&gt;LIKE I DID AND IT BREAKS SO THEY CAN REPLACE IT.</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth feel as if I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.  The timer makes it easy for me to know if I&#x27;ve spent enough time (and not too much time) brushing each quadrant (top left, top right, etc.)  Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This is the third Sonicare toothbrush I have purchased. The first on I bought was the basic model, it worked well but stopped working after about a year. I bought one for my sister as a gift, and she reported liking it, but that it stopped working after about six months (she was using it in the shower, but I feel a toothbrush should be waterproof) I replaced mine with the Sonicare Healthy White because I wanted the extra whitening power. The Healthy White is about $30 more then the base model, and the only difference I see is an optional additional thirty seconds of cleaning time. My Healthy White lasted a little less then a year, and I think it just shook itself apart. The head no longer connects properly to the base, so rather then vibrate, the toothbrush just makes a dull buzzing noise. The product works well enough, but at that price I expect them to last longer then a year.</li>
    <li> My wife lost her sonicare toothbrush and I gave her mine (with a new brush head, of course) and ordered this to replace my old one.  I love the quad pace timer (it beeps after 30 seconds) so I get consistent time.  This adds 2 15 second cycles to whiten the front teeth.  I have used a sonicare toothbrush for more than 15 years.  This one is vastly superior to the ones used before.  All had the &amp;#34;e series&amp;#34; brush head and allowed saliva, water and toothpaste to get in the brush handle.  The construction of this does not.  Additionally, (very subjectively) this seems to clean much better!</li>
    <li> Worked great for a year and then it stopped charging. Lo and behold Philips has a nice little scam running here where you can&#x27;t simply replace the rechargeable battery when it dies you need to replace the whole toothbrush. I won&#x27;t be buying one of these things again.</li>
    <li> I was a dedicated Oral-B user for years, but recently switched. This is way better than Oral-B! The new Philips toothbrush head design is excellent and doesn&#x27;t gunk up like the old models do. (My mom had the old model and has that problem.) Since the brush is thin, you can angle it and easily get into tight spaces in your mouth to clean thoroughly. Holds its charge for over a week (with 1 user). Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had an older one and it finally just gave out. I had to get a new one because using a regular tooth brush just doesn&#x27;t do the job well. I love Sonicare and will use one for as long as I have teeth. A great buy!</li>
    <li> My old one broke after about 8 years...Definitely will buy another when this one breaks in 8 years!!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I am really surprised about the great results of the Sonicare!&lt;br /&gt;I can only recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I love this because of the convenience.  Usually when I brush my teeth at night I&#x27;m already super tired.  This does all the work for you.  I was brushing too hard with the manual toothbrush so that led to some recession in my gums.  With this toothbrush, I know I barely need to add pressure to get great results.  Once again, it really does all the work for you!  I also love that it times your brushing for the 2 minutes recommended time.  That helps to get a thorough cleaning.  The whitening setting is also a nice little bonus considering how much I love coffee and red wine.</li>
    <li> Great product. Takes a while to get used to as it can feel very aggressive at first (there&#x27;s a transition mode that aims to help, but i just got used to it after a few days). Leaves your mouth feeling deeply clean with minimal effort. No whitening that I have seen, however.</li>
    <li> Work really good and has a timer which goes of 4 times so you can tell when to switch to another part of your mouth to brush.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I been using Sonicare since 2006 and have just upgraded to the newer body from the older fatter design.  To me it works actually the same and nothing performance wise is much different except for the brush head and slimmer design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;+like the title said it isn&#x27;t as much of a bacteria petri dish.  Water used to get inside the old design and you got mold and bacteria all over when you change the brush head.  This one has a smaller area surface and there is only a little spot where the mold or bacteria still collects.&lt;br /&gt;+Much slimmer design&lt;br /&gt;+Price of toothbrush head is cheaper the older series design.&lt;br /&gt;+Sonicare service is top notch.  I bought a 2 pack system in 2006 or 2007.  One of the tooth brush failed to recharge and Sonicare sent me a new one and I sent them my old one which was still under the warranty at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-Still expensive, replacing toothbrush head over the years isn&#x27;t cheap wither.&lt;br /&gt;-tooth brush head while cheaper doesn&#x27;t last as long as the older model.  I get fraying within 3 months, where the older model lasted up to half a year. The cheaper price of the new model doesn&#x27;t matter if they last half as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;*feels just as power full&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like Sonicare toothbrush for my teeth, and does a better good then conventional brushing.  It is that it cost more to maintain and replace the heads.  I don&#x27;t really care for the other brush features so I won&#x27;t play for the premium</li>
    <li> There really isn&#x27;t enough power in this toothbrush to remove plaque or even clean properly between teeth.  If you don&#x27;t floss and use a water jet after, you won&#x27;t get the results you want.</li>
    <li> Whiter teeth, cleaner gums. No complaints at all. It does a good job of wearing away at plaque between dental cleanings.</li>
    <li> However well it works, a toothbrush this expensive shouldn&#x27;t konk out in little more than a year. I will definitely buy a different brand to replace it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned sonicare toothbrushes for the past 8 years and believe no other brand cleans my teeth as well as the sonicare.  This is my third sonicare purchase.  The only disappointment I have is that they do not last longer.  Mine just seem to stop after a couple years but it does not hinder me from purchasing again since I am happy with the way it works.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old Sonacare toothbrush with the Healthy White and am very happy with it.  Holds a charge really well and the slim profile makes it easy to reach every corner of my mouth.</li>
    <li> I started using the Philips Sonicare right after a dental cleaning in July.  I recently went for my six-months cleaning.  The hygienist said that my teeth had less plaque and stain than ever before and the cleaning was done in record time.  Since I was using my usual toothpaste and same old twice-a-day brushing, the difference, without a doubt, was the Sonicare.  It&#x27;s kind of a buzzy, wild thing in the mouth at first but I have gotten used to it and will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a religious flosser so using this toothbrush goes a long way toward making my teeth feel dentist-clean.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric toothbrush! I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without it! It feels like I just went to the dentist every time I use it! After two uses, I already noticed that my teeth looked whiter. I will save a lot of money with this since I won&#x27;t have to buy those white-strips anymore! Thank goodness for Sonicare!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended I purchase this since I&#x27;ve acquired dry mouth due to medication I have to take. The only thing I regret is not getting one sooner. The battery lasts longer than I expected. I started out using it once a day and now use it twice daily. Had no idea I was leaving so much &amp;#34;ick&amp;#34; behind after finishing brushing my teeth. Even my dentist has noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to judge the whitening application of this brush; that&#x27;s not why I bought it. I just wanted a good electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;It seems a little better than the Oral B brush I had. Cleans my chops well. The Oral B brush lasted about two years then conked out. Hopefully this PHillips is reliable.</li>
    <li> I switched to this toothbrush from my old Braun OralB, which I had been using for years.  It is probably an upgrade in some respects, but not as good in others.  First of all, it is too expensive, probably because of all the unnecessary stuff it has on it, like the 30-second signal to switch quadrants.  Nothing but a gimmick to make you think you&#x27;re getting something great.  A cheap clock in your bathroom with a second hand could do the same thing.  And I don&#x27;t know about you, but I can&#x27;t go a full two minutes without having to spit, which means you have to shut the brush off and start it again.  Also, the brush head is way too big for people with small mouths.  It is very hard to maneuver around the inside front teeth.  I have to hold it at a 90 degree angle to get the teeth clean along the gum line which, of course, sprays water everywhere.  I plan to replace the original brush with the compact heads (again, way too expensive) and see if they are better.  The whitening cycle is another gimmick they could do without.  Unless your teeth are stained on the outside, no toothbrush is going to make them any whiter.  The thing does do a good job of cleaning the outside teeth and is quieter and has more power than the OralB. I do prefer a power brush over a manual one, but I am just not that impressed with this one.  It&#x27;s okay, but nothing to rave about.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for my girlfriend and I. We both love these tooth brushes. They definitely worth the money, and we both agreed we cannot go back to regular tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice toothbrush with great vibration, however, I wish the back of the brush wasn&#x27;t plastic, because it hits my teeth and is kind of unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Had I listened to my dentist and periodontist who have been nagging me to get one of these things, I might have avoided gum surgery, gum recession, tooth wear, and a whole lot of problems.  This toothbrush is worth every penny.  I&#x27;ve used the Oral B round head type in the past, but this type excels.  It&#x27;s a combination of rapid brushing with sonication, which means it&#x27;s a bit loud in the head due to sound conduction through teeth and bone.  It takes a few rounds of use to get used to the sensation.  But two minutes gives you a dentist&#x27;s chair cleaning.  I noticed the difference with two days of use.  The unit delivers a one-minute cycle broken up into 15 second intervals to ensure sufficient brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; feature of the 710 is a nice feature, giving an additional 15 second scrub for the smile.  One slight correction:  The enclosed directions are not accurate regarding the &amp;#34;Clean/White&amp;#34; mode.  It is not 2 minutes plus 30 seconds but 1 minute plus 15 seconds, after which the unit must be restarted.  This turns out to be good since a &amp;#34;spit break&amp;#34; is helpful between sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is a good compromise between cost and excessive &amp;#34;bells and whistles.&amp;#34;  It does what you need it to do.  The charging base is small and takes up little room on a crowded sink countertop.  The base holds two brush heads with color coded rings to make sharing the unit easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may be deterred by the cost of  good electric toothbrush.  Look at it this way:  It costs as much as one cleaning at the dentist.  And you get it twice a day, every day.  It&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for about three weeks now and I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel very smooth and it does a much better job than a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I think my dental hygienist will be pleased.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbrush. So far, I haven&#x27;t really found any negatives, so I&#x27;ll just list the positives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Incredible battery life! At first I was charging the toothbrush weekly, as was recommended by the manufacturer. Then, I forgot to put it on the charger, and a week turned into two, and it still worked great! There is a battery indicator light that I check each time I brush, and it has stayed solid green (it blinks when it&#x27;s low) for nearly three weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The timer and Quadpacer are so useful! The toothbrush not only times brushing for 2 minutes, it also helps me get each area of my mouth clean by dividing the mouth into four quadrants (inside top teeth, inside bottom, outside top, outside bottom) and indicates when to move on. This seems so basic and I really didn&#x27;t think I would need it, but I definitely brush more thoroughly with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Overall, this is just a really comfortable brush. I like that it ramped up the power when I first started using it, because the vibrating motion was jarring at first. The brush head is very small and took some getting used to, but I really do like this toothbrush, and I feel like my teeth are much cleaner after having used it.</li>
    <li> First time using the brush was a strange experience. But after following the instructions on how to position the brush etc. I was/am enjoying the brush. Highly recommend. Better then the old electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It works very well and it can work for a month. I do not need to worry about charging every day</li>
    <li> Great replacement hope it last linger than the one it replaced. Good price when compared to the online store. ok</li>
    <li> I like this so much I bought one for each member of my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered this a mid-range purchase between basic model and the one with all the bells &amp; whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets, great purchase!</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Sonicare Toothbrushes are an excellent tool for thoroughly cleaning your teeth.  Great for kids, too because they tend to be very lazy when it comes to manual brushing.  Every new user,  in my family is always amazed at how clean their teeth feel, after a Sonicare brushing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy and comfortable to use, lightweight and the rechargeable batteries last  a long time (although, it is always returned to its attractive charging station after each brushing.  I can&#x27;t speak for other brands but the Sonicare is superb.</li>
    <li> I was raised on a Sonicare and then once I moved out of my house I could never afford one. Well this Christmas I used my gift cards and have no idea how I dealt with my dirty mouth for so long! This product is amazing and highly suggested to anyone looking to buy one!</li>
    <li> The model I have has a Clean and White mode that is to brush for two minutes and then a change in sound and motion is to be the signal to start brushing the upper front teeth,  At the sound of a beep, you are to brush the lower front teeth.  However, I do not sense a change in brushing sound or motion in the first phase nor do I hear a beep to start the second phase.  Very disappointed with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I am pleased with the product overall.  The brush head will stop brushing when it senses too much pressure being applied to the teeth.  I tend to brush hard (resulting in receding gums) so this feature is very important to me.  The true test will be when I visit the dentist in four months or so.</li>
    <li> Awsome brush, almost 4 years strong. BUT,  For those of you with the vibrating portion coming loose, I laugh when I see those reviews. Google it, and it&#x27;s an easy fix. Easy to take apart . The screw that comes loose is a eye glass size phillips head screw. I&#x27;ve tightened mine twice.  The best thing to do is put some lock tight on the screw, witch I haven&#x27;t done yet.</li>
    <li> I should have looked at this in a store before purchasing it.  I was pretty surprised at how small the brush heads are.  They look more like toddler tooth brushes than adult, and the small size makes it seem like it takes a lot longer to brush my teeth than with my old Oral B brush.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the toothpaste as well.  And I&#x27;m finding it difficult to turn the thing off.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to respond to pressure from my thumb.  I have to use quite a bit of pressure with a fingernail.  So far I&#x27;m pretty unhappy with the quality of the brush heads as well.  I have tried two different ones and both changed color in less than a month of use.  But the worst part is that one or two bristles come out in my mouth nearly every time.  Phillips is sending me another box of brush heads.  I&#x27;m hoping that they will perform better.  Time will tell.  I will see whether my dentist likes the results.</li>
    <li> This is the second time we purchased this item. We have been using Sonicare products for many years and like their products.  The previous items lasted about three years.</li>
    <li> It was suggested from my dentist, I was little skeptical but went ahead and bought it! Best thing I ever did!</li>
    <li> It is very good! Totally bought 4 for everyone in our family. Used other cheap one before, this one is much better.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy when you need just the handle since the charging base always works&lt;br /&gt;and the brush heads need to be replaced every six months.&lt;br /&gt;We originally purchased the Sonicare Toothbrush 12 years ago because of gum issues. Mine were so bad that&lt;br /&gt;I needed periodontal work but after three months they improved so well that I did not need the&lt;br /&gt;treatment.&lt;br /&gt;This saved a lot of pain and money for the treatment so the expense of the Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;On a couple of occasions were caught without our brushes and had to resort to&lt;br /&gt;a manual brush and our teeth did not feel clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I have my teeth cleaned both the hygienist and dentist comment on the&lt;br /&gt;excellent  health of my gums.&lt;br /&gt;We have given their Sonicare to our grown children and grandchildren for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;It occurred to us that they might get the wrong impression but now they are true believers.&lt;br /&gt;We would not be without our Sonicare toothbrush ever.&lt;br /&gt;Give yourself good oral health by using the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great.  Got it for half the price that is listed in stores.  My dentist recommended that I get a sonicare and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with how my teeth feel like I have just been to the dentist after every brushing.  Highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> At first I never thought I would buy one of these toothbrushes - ever. Then last week my Dentist recommended that I purchase one of these toothbushes which they sell however they wanted to sell me a different Version for $140 which is comparable to the Amazon price. I checked on Amazon and looked at the reviews. Based on that, it seemed that the toothbrushes are basically the same and the only difference is that there are some different settings. That&#x27;s not good enough for me To pay extra money for additional features. Particularly since the additional features just seem to be different Rhythms with the same brushing speed.  My mouth feels extra clean after brushing and to be honest, I used to be one of those people who would only brush my teeth in the morning because I would do a very good brushing and in the evening I would be too tired to do a good brushing. Don&#x27;t judge me!. Now, because  bushing is so much faster Since it only takes two to 2 1/2 minutes, I brush my teeth twice a day. Of course I should&#x27;ve always been doing that  however this brush makes it much easier. The two-year warranty is also very comforting.</li>
    <li> When choosing a Sonicare toothbrush, I was looking for something without a lot of bells and whistles that was easy to use (and clean) - this fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The ProResults brush head is a great improvement over the old brush heads that collected gunk. Just snap off, wipe, and snap back on, that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I really like the 30 second beeps for each quadrant of the mouth - not a dealbreaker obviously but convenient to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The brush has a second mode for &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; that is more powerful but to be honest, I haven&#x27;t used it more than once or twice because the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; mode works just fine IMO. I admit one of the reasons I considered this was because I&#x27;m allergic to whatever they put in the whitening toothpastes and this was a non-chemical way to whiten. I think it does a great job even without the whitening mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Travel charger is convenient (pops out of the base), though the base is so small I doubt it makes that much difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Battery life has been great so far (about 7 months) - I charge when the little green light is blinking, maybe once every 2-3 weeks. Honestly if I&#x27;m going on a trip for 3-4 days I don&#x27;t even bring the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Most importantly, my teeth look and feel great! My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush because I was brushing too hard and I&#x27;m really glad I made the switch. Definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip, registering your product on the Philips website extends the warranty, always a good thing.</li>
    <li> The book says you can control the pulse changes, but, doesn&#x27;t happen.  I&#x27;m not too happy with this model and preferred my older model which finally died.</li>
    <li> This Sonicare was highly recommended by a DMD that was on the show, The Doctors. I&#x27;m older now and decided it was time to get a really good daily cleaning at home, so I bought it!  I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with the look and feel of my teeth and I encourage all to get one!</li>
    <li> super-hard to accurately parse the differing models of this single product; oddly complicated. thought i was getting the 3-mode unit with the &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; base (read: has a cavity for stashing extra cord) but this is a more basic model with a teeny-tiny charger base. it works just fine—just like the better models—just would&#x27;ve liked to have better known what i was buying from the start.</li>
    <li> Works great, teeth feel cleaner than they ever did using a traditional toothbrush.  30 second interval timer is pretty convenient, not completely sold on the stain-removing setting but I still use it because MAYBE it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unit is comfortable and light, fully charged battery will last you a couple of weeks easy brushing twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans absolutely well and it protects the gum as well.&lt;br /&gt;Normal toothbrush will cause injury and bleeding on ur gum, but this won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Now my gum looks perfectly clean and no more awful bleeding after brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad point is - it doesn&#x27;t really clean in between the tooth. Food residue that stuck in between still exists even after brushing with this electric toothbrush. Guess it still has its limitation?</li>
    <li> Good compromise between price and performance. Cheaper models seems to use worse brushes, and the more advanced (expensive) models have mostly useless modes and do not add anything real. Works much better than a simple brush. Would be even better to have an option of running it from the wall without recharging batteries, but companies seem to dislike this...</li>
    <li> I have had my Sonicare for about a year now, and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.  I had owned one of the original Sonicare models years back, but after it went out on me I ended up using regular toothbrushes for years.  With my HealthyWhite, I feel like I just got out of the dentist after every brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads are kind of pricey, but I recently picked up a generic replacement head here on Amazon and have found them to be acceptable, for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Battery does not recharge after one year of use.  Seems too expensive for one year of use.  I had a similar mdoel prior to this that lasted a couple of years.  The good part is Phillips replaced it under warranty.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toothbrush! The battery lasts longer than I thought and I would recommend this product to anyone. The shipping was fast and the toothbrush came in great condition.</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of my dentist, I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare toothbrush for years.  My original Sonicare works fine but is so old that it is difficult to find replacement brush heads for it.  It uses the old style that has the whole mechanism attached to the brush head.  I couldn&#x27;t find them locally, and amazon&#x27;s price for two was $65. !?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to just buy a new Sonicare instead, at $70 for this model.  Because many new appliances aren&#x27;t nearly as well made as the old ones they replace (in my experience), I was somewhat dreading using my new Sonicare for the first time.  I was afraid that the new one with the simpler brush head might not work as well as the original models.  (Why would Sonicare have made such a complicated brush head if it wasn&#x27;t necessary?) Wow, I was so pleased to find that the new one is fantastic!  The brushing action seems the same as the original, but my teeth feel much cleaner with the new one.  I also think my teeth are a little whiter after using it only a few days.  In fairness to my old Sonicare, it still works but the brush head is almost worn down to a nub, which I&#x27;m sure has lessened its effectiveness.  The different design of the new model should prevent toothpaste and gunk from getting into the handle, which was a flaw of the old one.  Also, the replacement brush heads for the new model are much less expensive.  I charged it for 24 hours before using it, and haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on how long the battery holds a charge.  If it&#x27;s even close to the battery performance of my old one, that won&#x27;t be an issue. I like the features of this model--useful without a lot of bells and whistles, and amazon&#x27;s price is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence about buying a Sonicare, go ahead and buy one!  It&#x27;s a great toothbrush and much less expensive than dental work.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift and was exactly what the recipient wanted and needed. Product has great features at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very into my oral health but quite new to the world of electric t/b&#x27;s, I&#x27;m glad I went with Sonicare HealthyWhite. It totally takes ALL of the work out of daily brushing. Soft bristles, simple comfortable design, gentle soothing vibrations. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now, it just feels so good! The two minute timer is beyond convenient, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like two minutes. The brush-head reaches all surfaces of ALL of my teeth. I didn&#x27;t realize that my back teeth weren&#x27;t being adequately cleaned until I got this t/b. I barely have to move the brush at all, just back and forth, slowly, gently, and my teeth are thoroughly cleaned, smooth, and SHINY! What I really love is the great massage my gums get from the soft bristles! No more tender sensitive gums from scrubbing with a manual. I&#x27;ve had the brush for 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve ONLY charged it once! Not to mention the excellent shipping arrangement from Amazon. The brush itself was about $20 cheaper than other places I&#x27;ve looked, and I also ordered two other items from different sellers and I received them ALL 2-3 days before they were expected to arrive. My teeth are VERY satisfied with this purchase. They&#x27;re getting too spoiled, I just don&#x27;t think I could go manual again lol.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush. My teeth have never felt so clean, and after the 3rd or 4th use, I could already see my teeth had gotten a shade whiter. THis is a must have!</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Healthy White is a huge improvement over a regurlar toothbrush. My dentist had been recommending it for the past two years so I finally got it on sale and bought one. Now I cannot go anywhere without my Sonicare. Traveling with it is easy and the battery lasts for a minimum of two weeks so I do not have to pack the charger on most trips. Replacing the heads is a little expensive when compared to a regular toothbrush; however, the results are well worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I was pretty hesitant to spend this much on a toothbrush, but it is well worth it. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, but so far I am very happy with it. I have sensitive gums, and I think the soft bristles and &#x27;sonic&#x27; action make a huge difference. I haven&#x27;t had any gum sensitivity with it, and my teeth feel much cleaner than they do after using a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I also prefer it to the feel of other electic toothbrushes--I&#x27;ve used others with a rotating brush head, and moving bristles, and much prefer this style of toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the whitening part, I&#x27;m not sure--I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. However, I bought it because I thought it would be more effective and less painful on my sensitive gums. I&#x27;m not that concerned with the whitening aspect of it.</li>
    <li> This is holding up for me a year after purchase. I haven&#x27;t noticed any battery problems or performance issues. I use it twice a day and have seen a huge improvement in my teeth whiteness and oral health. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Missing from this set are the two brush holder stands. Our last Phillips Sonocare machine had this convenience. I look forward to a long battery life.</li>
    <li> Best deal on this toothbrush. Received it when expected, no damaged parts. I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this purchase. Great job!!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working great and I love it! It works in Europe as well as in the US and all you need is an adapter plug.</li>
    <li> I love it, gives a nice clean. stays charged pretty good. nice to have the color bands for the different tops</li>
    <li> My dentist is very happy.  This product cleans my teeth much better then regular brush.  Get complements when I go to dentist. Only wish is it stayed cleaner on stand as any sitting water between interfaces starts to mold.</li>
    <li> i have always flossed and brushed my teeth every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my dental hygienist recommended that i get this sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was delivered today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after flossing and using it for the first time, my teeth felt like they do after the hygienist cleans them.  that is a lot better feeling than flossing and regular brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did not know that was possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love my new hx6711/02.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you buy it you will like it.</li>
    <li> I travel all over the world, no telling where I might be the next time I need to get my teeth cleaned (I love coffee!) I have been spending quite a bit of money on dentists for ultrasonic teeth cleaning, until a friend (a heavy smoker and coffee drinker) told me about the Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite 710. He told me he no longer needs to go to a dentist or hygienist to get his teeth cleaned and he proudly showed me his pearly whites! I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after having used it for over a month, I am more sold on it than ever. My teeth have never been cleaner or whiter (I still use the whitening setting on the brush, to give me extra power and more time). The Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite 710 is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist thought it would be good for me to get a sonicare tooth brush and so I researched and selected this one. I love how clean my teeth feel after brushing! The 2 minute timer with the 30 second beep notice is helpful in ensuring I brush all areas of my teeth. The movement of the brush gets in the small areas that my manual brushing couldn&#x27;t do. I will be interested t see how my teeth measure up at my next dental cleaning :)</li>
    <li> I really liked this electric toothbrush until it started working only intermittently and then died completely about a week ago.  I do not know if this one was defective, but I am hesistent to buy the same model.</li>
    <li> Been using for a week. Teeth seems to be cleaner. Not sure how long the brush will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge is good...</li>
    <li> i have been using this toothbrush for almost a year and a half. hands down the best toothbrush i have ever purchased. even my dentist complimented me on how clean my teeth were which was a first. amazing product.</li>
    <li> This has met my expectations. I have had Sonicare toothbrushes before and I have never been disappointed. Three more words required to finish this review.</li>
    <li> I purchased in September 2012. It stopped working this morning after 7 months, although it was good taken care. Compared to Sonicare products in 4-5 years ago, Sonicare quality is getting low, cheap materials. Give up and try other brands.</li>
    <li> My Sonicare toothbrush died.  But this isn&#x27;t a negative review.  My Sonicare was 14 years old!  I can&#x27;t remember another electronic device that&#x27;s lasted me that long.  So I just bot this one and love it.  Of course they have made a few improvements in 14 years - it&#x27;s smaller and the stands nicer.  Other than that, it gives the same great bushing.  If you&#x27;re one of those people who wants to keep all their teeth, buy this brush.</li>
    <li> After a week of using it, I legitimately noticed my teeth being brighter than if I continued using a regular tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;They only downside is not being able to use it in the shower. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Seems pretty good so far. Never had problems with tooth paste dripping off the brush until I got this those. I have to brush my teeth with my toothbrush held above my mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about two days now and I found it to be a lot more powerful then I expected. The brush moves so fast to point where you can hear it hum.  I would not however substitute this for getting a cleaning from my dentist, but my teeth feel very clean. As far as the loose brush head attachment that some people keep referring to, mine attached perfectly to the handle and did not feel loose at all. The only down side to this toothbrush is the price. If you can get it for less than $100 I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a steal. Over all great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife since I broke her last one.  Apparently I brush too hard so the motor burned out on the last one we had.  So I bought a new one and now I am not allowed to use it :)  She really likes it and her dentist has commented on her last two visits on how much less plaque she has now than in previous visits.  Great product, just be careful not to brush too hard.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare for decades, before it was taken over by Phillips.  I have bought probably 10 Sonicare toothbrushes over the years for family and friends, but am shocked by the quality of my latest purchase.  It is very noisy, shakes much more than previous models, and the on off button is not easily visible so that several times in looking for the button, the (heavily shaking) toothbrush knocked against my teeth so hard that it hurt (lasting long enough to be disturbing).  I will be switching brands after this one.....sadly, as I have so loyally stuck to Sonicare for years.  And just to add, my last Sonicare suddenly died for no reason that I could detect.  It was not that old and the folks at Phillips were not very helpful when I contacted them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes it and it&#x27;s very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it if you&#x27;re in the market for a rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The healthy White is all that you will need. Light years better than the&lt;br /&gt;older models. Very easy to keep clean un like the older models. Great&lt;br /&gt;buy.</li>
    <li> Instructions are good. If you have never had a quad tooth brush, it takes a little time to get use to. I can not tell if it is whiting my teeth, but cleaning it does well.</li>
    <li> this has 2 different cleaning cycles one is longer and it is suppose to help you make your teeth whiter. But If you just want to turn it off to spit or put more toothpaste on, you have to hold it for a couple of seconds for it to not restart the cycle. However, you don&#x27;t know if you held it long enough because it is off while you are holding the button... does that make sense. The replacement heads are expensive too, not as expensive as oral surgery but still.</li>
    <li> I do not like having to cycle through the different intensities of vibration; would prefer to be able to just go to one or another.  Also, have been using regularly for over 2 weeks and do not see any degree of whitening at all.</li>
    <li> I had heard very good things about Sonic Care and how it cleans deep and will whiten teeth in a matter of weeks.  I had no idea that there is a deep vibration involved.  It is so severe that it loosed fillings in my teeth and shook loose a couple of crowns.  I cannot afford to replace all of this expensive dental work just to use this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The vibration cause the roots of my teeth to ache up into my jaw.</li>
    <li> The R723 has two brush heads, cord storage in the base, a sensitive setting, and a travel case. The R710 is being sent by Sonicare for warranty replacement even though it is not as good as the defective item it is supposed to replace. They will not honor the warranty and ship a comparable item.</li>
    <li> people are leaving it set on the charge stand 24/7.  I fully charge mine and then I don&#x27;t return it to the stand till it needs another charge.  I think you will find this resolves the battery issues.</li>
    <li> I recieved my Sonicare toothbrush yesterday and I absolutly love it. This toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling SUPER clean, like you just left the dentist!</li>
    <li> When it works, it&#x27;s great. Unfortunately the last one failed after 3 months. I&#x27;ve had to buy a replacement and so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare products.  I used to have the bigger one but this one fits on the counter much better.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had one of the original Sonicare brushes for about 10 years.  When it finally died, I bought this one.  What a great toothbrush--light, easy to reach in tight spaces, and the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; function is cool.</li>
    <li> Getting rid of that silly magnetic induction from the brushing end was a great decision by Sonicare.  The much smaller head doesn&#x27;t trap toothpaste goo (fairly nasty combo of minty and something) and seems to be much better at transferring power from the brush itself.  The brush handle and base are much smaller and more elegant than the E-series.  I was a little skeptical, but willing to try the whitening feature of this brush and believe that it has started to take the coffee stains off my teeth in less than a week.  I don&#x27;t drink that much coffee...or do I?  Hehe.  It comes with one brushhead.  Also, it was easy enough to use that I didn&#x27;t bother to read the manual.  These one button things can be a little confusing sometimes (dive computers...)</li>
    <li> I just switched from using an Oral B sonic toothbrush to this Sonicare Healthy White.  This is clearly an upgrade over the Oral B.  My dentist recommended using this type of brush to help prevent gingivitis.  This brush is powerful and has lots of different brush options depending on your needs.  The other important point is that the brushes are readily available and much lower cost than the comparable Oral B brand.  I highly recommend you consider this toothbrush if you want to improve your dental health at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> A great toothbrush except for its short battery life. The two year warranty is good for the simple reason that this brush must have a two year life. Sure as clockwork it goes caput just after the warranty runs out. Have had several and this has been true for each.</li>
    <li> My wife and I went with the Sonicare to replace an Oral B electric toothbrush whose battery finally gave up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our experiences thus far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, my wife HATED it.  She said she preferred the sensation and mechanics of the Oral B, and started bugging me about getting her another one of that brand.  But she continued to give the Sonicare a chance, and at about the 10-day point, said she now preferred the new toothbrush.  She says her teeth FEEL about as clean as they did with the Oral B, and that they LOOK whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was more open-minded about the Sonicare from the get-go.  I have extremely sensitive gums, and as much care as I took to brush with the Oral B, I occasionally found the rotating head chewing up my gum-line -- to the extent that I would occasionally have to stop brushing a sore area for a few days to allow it to heal.  There seems to be no such possibility of that type of damage to gums with the Sonicare mechanism -- it simply uses a less abrasive method.  Also, from a purely subjective standpoint, I concur with my wife that my teeth look a bit whiter after brushing with the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I note from other reviewers is the greater potential for mechanical failure with the Sonicare (the Oral B&#x27;s last for as long as the battery holds out).  Since we&#x27;ve only had ours for about a month, I can&#x27;t speak to that issue.  I will update my review if I do have any negative experiences in that regard (knocking on wood!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also -- again, since we&#x27;ve only had the Sonicare for a month -- I can&#x27;t speak yet to how our future dental check-ups will go.  I&#x27;ll also update the review based on that, if necessary.  At least for now, I must say that my teeth certainly feel AT LEAST as clean as they did when I was using the Oral B, and my gums feel significantly less abused.</li>
    <li> I was holding out on buying one of these  because I thought it would be so cumbersome just to brush. I finally decided to give it a try since part of my gum is starting to wear away and I am getting sensitivity. I know this is supposed to help with brushing correctly by cleaning your teeth and being gentle on your gums.  I am so glad I finally got this, I love brushing now and feel that my teeth get so clean.  It is like coming home from the dentist clean except you can have this everyday!</li>
    <li> My old one finally died and I was very pleased with the Sonicare product!  The timer is an added plus!</li>
    <li> Easily the best toothbrush i have used. after a couple weeks of use I tried my regular toothbrush again one morning and my teeth felt dirty all day. Once you go Sonicare you don&#x27;t go back apparently.</li>
    <li> After years of trying to figure out the best electric toothbrush to get, I settled on this one. I love the lithium ion battery, the timer and the way it gets my teeth very noticeably cleaner than hand brushing. I&#x27;ve had issues with the lower left side of my mouth and those teeth feel better than ever. I&#x27;m looking forward to feedback from my dentist at my next visit.</li>
    <li> I love both I&#x27;ve owned.  Especially like the quadrant timer.  It makes me think (feel guilty) when I am rushing.</li>
    <li> The brush is a little bit hard. However, total experience is very good. Has two mode . ha ha ha</li>
    <li> I will get me another one of this. It is doing an amazing job. I told my dentist what my tooth brush is and he said continue using it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Have used it for the last 13 years. Won&#x27;t trade for anything else.</li>
    <li> I must have kept my old OralB waaaay to long. This thing is awesome, almost scary, and I am impressed with how it lasts for several days (at least four so far) without weakening.</li>
    <li> I use mine in the shower - as it is a bit messy. Think dentist office, mouth open, without the suction machine. And WOW, it cleans GREAT!</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my Philips Sonicare that died after 8 years maybe. This seems to be doing its job it has that nice function of an extra 30 seconds to get your front of your teeth for stains, the battery life seems to be pretty good between charges when using it at least twice a day, the only downside is the cost.</li>
    <li> Easier to clean than previous models.  Holds a charge for a long time.  There&#x27;s not much NOT to like.  Received my order promptly which was great considering my old sonic care was on its last leg.  Over-all...good purchase at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user from the day they came out.  My old faithful lasted me for YEARS!!  I bought this new fangled one, thinking it&#x27;s got to be even better than the original....right??  Nope!!  Save your money.  It doesn&#x27;t clean your teeth as well as the old model that collected spit...at least that you could rinse away and the problem is solved.  The brushes for this model are fine if you have a super tiny mouth...not the case here.  The brushes fray at an alarming speed....the only REAL improvement is the lithium ion battery.  So, look for the old model with the spit problem with the brush head, and get REALLY CLEAN TEETH, without breaking the bank...  Sometimes they should just leave a good product alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Performed as expected from Sonicare. This is my third purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Keeps working after several years. Good quality. Easy to use</li>
    <li> Very simple design and does a great job!</li>
    <li> The brush head on the Phillip R710 Healthy White vibrates off as you are using it.  I got hit in the eye with it.  I put it back on and it again came flying off again.  I thought it almost went down my sink drain.     Then I called Phillips Sonicare and they told me that this has never happened before.  I told them it is not true because I read on the Amazon review boards that it happened to two other people.  They proceeded to tell me they have nothing to do with Amazon.  Then they said they would send me another one.  I told them I would rather have another model.  I had previosly owned the E series model for several years.  It was a good model. They told me they couldn&#x27;t send me a different model.  I told them  I was very unhappy and was a customer for many years.  They didn&#x27;t care. Then they made sure I couldn&#x27;t return the used brush with the replacement brush, they were sending me.  They made me wait for over one month to receive my new brush.    During the waiting period for my replacement brush, I received an email from their customer service division requeting to know how their product and service was.  I reported a negative critique.  I told them I was waiting for my replacemenet brush for almost a month. Still no one from their customer service division called to apologize to me.    Next time, I will take the Amazon negative reviews a little more seriously.  I was just so excited about the newer technology and wanted to try it.  As the old saying goes, if it is not broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this appliance, and it replaced an identical (but earlier) model. The new one works as it should, and accomplishes what a toothbrush needs to accomplish. I am a comparison shopper, and the Amazon price was better than what local stores were pricing the same item. It was an easy decision to purchase online from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product might work well at the beginning but the handle unit has a problem that the company will not stand behind nor fix.... I had one unit go out in 13 months, they did replace it but when the replacement unit went out in 18 months then they said it was out of warranty and could not replace it... For the price of these units they should last longer that 18 months...</li>
    <li> Has been an excellent product so far. Battery seems to hold up well. . .Look forward to many successful brushings. . Dog likes the sound if I leave it on and put it in a dish. . .</li>
    <li> Wow! If you&#x27;ve never used one of these, you&#x27;re in for an experience. It is almost like a dentist&#x27;s drill -- it&#x27;s pretty powerful! It&#x27;s a good thing it takes 14 brushings on the &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; mode to gradually build up to full force! It sometimes makes me dizzy when I&#x27;m brushing, due to the vibration of the fluid in my ear, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for what this thing does! I&#x27;ve been overdue for a teeth cleaning, so I had some pretty nasty tartar build-up on the inside of my bottom teeth. After just 3-4 cleanings, the tartar was almost completely removed, other than a very slight area between just a couple of my teeth. Also, I do believe it is helping to whiten my teeth. I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to maintain their dental hygeine between dentist visits! Now, when I go to the dentist this week for my cleaning, I won&#x27;t feel embarrassed about my tartar situation. Great product! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that everything in the bathroom gets splattered while brushing now because of this things power. I&#x27;m trying to keep my mouth closed while brushing to eliminate some of that...just a new learning curve well-worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I just love how clean my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.  Yeah replacement brush heads are a bit expensive, but so worth it IMO.  I lost my insurance when I decided to leave work to stay home with my daughter so I&#x27;ve missed a few teeth cleanings, but I&#x27;m confident that I&#x27;m maintaining good tooth health with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this toothbrush for teeth cleaning &amp; maintaining healthy gums. This is the 3rd one we&#x27;ve bought and the oldest one is more than 4 years old but still works great.</li>
    <li> I am a previous user of the Sonicare electric toothbrush and I was pleased to purchase another one.  This model is quieter than the previous one and does an excellent job.  I feel like the brush heads could be bigger.  The older model brush heads felt more sturdy.</li>
    <li> This is a great item! Best thing I ever ordered and it is almost two years old. Love it, cleans great and keeps on trucking!!</li>
    <li> Very fragil. Two brushes broke and plastic case does not close in only two years. Expensive heads, bad quality. Definitly I do not recomend this \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; product.</li>
    <li> The brush heads on this toothbrush, and everyone of the same in the past does not have any wheres near the three month life cycle. The same goes for just the brush heads ordered separately. This is not on this order particularly; but on all I have purchased. It is not an Amazon problem.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this toothbrush!  Once you go Sonicare you&#x27;ll NEVER go back!  This toothbrush has definitely left less for my dental hygienist to clean!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbrush for a little over two years now and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I want an upgrade after seeing all the bells and whistles that other toothbrushes come with and I want to keep it in the Sonicare family so I&#x27;ll likely get the DiamondClean or FlexCare Platinum (I&#x27;m leaning morre toward the DiamondClean, not because of the stats, but the appearance is just super pretty, sue me...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m aware of the competition between Oral-B and Sonicare brushes and since I&#x27;ve only used Sonicare, I am biased. I recently purchased the Oral-B Precision 7000 for my boyfriend and I&#x27;m jealous of the case it comes with and the sleek appearance (although I think the white toothbrush heads look odd on the modern, black base). I&#x27;ll be sure to buy my own brush head and take the Oral-B for a spin, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll want to remain a Sonicare girl. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Superior cleaning capability&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s cute, hey... That matters!&lt;br /&gt;3. The price is affordable and worth every penny. I&#x27;ll never forget the first time my dental hygienist was shocked and excited to see how clean my teeth were and how her job wouldn&#x27;t be as difficult as anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The replacement brushes are pretty expensive, especially if you&#x27;re like me and opt for the diamond clean ones.&lt;br /&gt;2. With the affordable price, you&#x27;re sacrificing the bells and whistles that are often mentioned in the electric toothbrush world. You&#x27;ll simply get an amazing toothbrush, no extra flossing tools or travel cases.</li>
    <li> This amazing tooth brush made my teeth whiter and cleaner. I recommend it to everyone who is considering buying it.</li>
    <li> I never really bought into the hype for electric toothbrushes. I was always skeptical about them. But after being encouraged by acquaintances I finally got one. WOW! My teeth have never felt cleaner(dentist trips included). I love how it tells you when to brush a different section of your mouth, how easy it was to put together, and how easy it is to charge. I will buy another if this one breaks, but they do come with an amazing warranty! 2.5 years! Buy this toothbrush, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love this tooth brush. My teeth feel like I just got them cleaned at the . You can&#x27;t go wrong with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I almost wish I bought their newer one since I love this one so much.  It is like going to the dentist twice a day.</li>
    <li> I just bought this toothbrush new in December, and 6 months later it is useless--cuts off after a second or two.</li>
    <li> should have started using it at an earlier age ( I,m 88) but it is well made and makes my mouth feel clean!</li>
    <li> This order Shipped fast, and is a great product! I am very pleased with this toothbrush, it works very well.</li>
    <li> This is the third model of Sonicare I&#x27;ve had and I like it better than any of the less expensive ones.  My teeth feel and look great and the new ergonomics of the handle are very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to upgrade from my 9 year old basic Sonicare that couldn&#x27;t hold a charge past one week. I asked for this for Christmas and have used it everyday twice a day since I unwrapped it--ans have only charged it the initial time. So far, I am loving this new one. The handle is less bulky and easier for my small hand to grip. I also like the whitening option; although I don&#x27;t know if it actually does any good. I also like the brush head design, I think it will get less grimy than the older design.Hopefully this should last me another 5+ years. I would recommend this model to those who don&#x27;t want the basics but don&#x27;t want all the bells and whistles of the higher priced models. If anything should change within the next year then I will update my review.</li>
    <li> This is the worst company. They do not honor the 2 year warranty on their toothbrushes. You call and they say they will get back to you and no one ever does. Emails go unanswered. Terrible customer service. The toothbrushes get moldy and stop charging. Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> It is really clean after i use this brush .  I didn;t have any electric brush, so i think this one is ok for me . BUT the brush is too expensiver . If  the brush can be cheaper , i think there will be more people can offer it .</li>
    <li> Experienced improved oral hygiene. Gums appear healthier. Cleans teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall nice design. Would have preferred a sturdier charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for ten months and haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with power supply. Hope it stays that way.</li>
    <li> It cleans substantially better a toothbrush.  I am not sure how long the rechargeable battery will last.  The new redesign is better than my last sonicare.  It&#x27;s great so far.</li>
    <li> We love our Sonicare brushes and brush tips. I wish the brush heads lasted longer before they suggest to replace them, but I would recommend this brush over any other as its powerful.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush that gets teeth really clean.  The only negative issues is the high price and that when the brush is touched to a tooth, there is a really loud buzzing that will startle the user.  A really good buy.</li>
    <li> It replaces an old elite series I bought back in 2003. I got 10 years of use out of that toothbrush until the battery finally coughed it&#x27;s last breath. This brush has all of the features I need and use and the reduced size is much easier to handle. The new style of attaching the brush head eliminates the crud-trap that was on the older models. That could turn into a real mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reasons I don&#x27;t give this product a 5 is:&lt;br /&gt;1. There is no travel case, hard or soft. There is one available for an additional 15 dollars. 80 clams for a toothbrush justify supplying a nice hard travel case. A chintzie neglect on Phillips behalf to not supply a 2 dollar plastic case.&lt;br /&gt;2. The charger is cheap and insignificant. Although it works fine, it barely has enough mass to support the toothbrush and is appears to be intended for travel use only.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad that this quality toothbrush isn&#x27;t supplied with neccessary accessories of the same quality.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s no comparison that I&#x27;ve found between the sonicare line and other electric toothbrushes.  My teeth just feel so much cleaner.</li>
    <li> After about a week of using this, I tried using my old toothbrush and was shocked at how useless it was. I was a bit worried about not upgrading to the sensitive gums model, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far--in fact, it&#x27;s been gentler on my gums than a regular soft toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I hate to admit that I am not good about going to the dentist or flossing.  I have been using a Sonicare tooth brush for years and rinse with listerine before and after brushing.  After not going to the dentist for 5 years, my dentist was amazed that I didn&#x27;t have any cavaties, no gum issues and little plaque.  This tooth brush is amazing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have my kids use sonicare and they have yet to see a cavaty and have nice white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of sonicare is cheaper than paying for serious dental bills.</li>
    <li> These products are on the pricey side, but the dental care and consistent performance for several years is outstanding.  We just purchased this (new and improved) second electric toothbrush after having the original one for many years.  It did finally show signs of &amp;#34;slowing down&amp;#34; by not being able to vibrate well even after being charged.  But after so many days/weeks/years, we felt it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;owe us&amp;#34; anything.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I visit the dentist as little as possible (every 7 years or so?) and as a result I have terrible tarter buildup on my teeth.  This toothbrush was so successful for my husband I tried it myself. After a good cleaning at the dentist I&#x27;ve been using this brush faithfully. I have to say, my teeth are almost tarter free. Not completely, but WAAAY better than without it. I can see a visible difference. My husband and I both have fewer bleeding gums, less tarter and cleaner teeth. I&#x27;m the worlds cheapest person so the price tag was tough for me, but I paid it (times 2) and am happy we did. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had one before this purchase and the battery died. I would like to have been able to replace the battery, but a company customer service rep said they were not replaceable. This was a good price, but later I found a better deal at Costco. Should have shopped a little longer.</li>
    <li> I fully admit my score is heavily weighted by the fact that after owning 2 of these units in four years, I am to the point of saying good bye forever.  Absolutely love how they work, Its that they do not last more than 2 years that is the problem. If money is no object and you can justify buying a new one every two years go for it.  Otherwise stick to the manual brush.    In both cases they start out working well, after about 18 months the charges will have started dying off noticeably, and by 2 years, it&#x27;s to the trash it goes.  The information is all over the internet and unless you want to try to do one of the modifications to replace the nicad batteries in the unit, your sunk.  Fair warning.  [...]    What ticks me off if my Norelco razers last typically 5 years, why is it these cannot last that long.</li>
    <li> I had this for four and a half years before it finally bit the dust, but for those four and a half years my teeth never felt cleaner.  For the past month I&#x27;ve been using a manual brush while I search for a replacement for this sonicare, and I can&#x27;t stand having to brush my own teeth without the assistance of a battery powered vibrating tooth brush.  Call me lazy, but it&#x27;s just never the same when you&#x27;re doing it on your own.  This held a charge for about 2 weeks the first years to two years, after that it varied.  Sometimes it would be okay for 2 weeks, other times just one but I learned to charge this before I went on vacation or had to travel for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use the healthy white setting very often but over the course of four years without using whitening strips or trays, my teeth have also stayed very white on top of being clean.  I would recommend this to anyone but personally I&#x27;m going to try another model this time around just for a change.</li>
    <li> I raved about this brush at work &amp; now several others have gotten it. My teeth have never felt so clean. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants squeaky clean teeth!</li>
    <li> Who thought they could get any better? Philips never stops innovating and this is one that is 1) affordable and 2) REALLY works well. LOVE it. Smaller footprint too on the counter . Got to love that.. Great investment and this is at a great price right now. makes a great holiday gift</li>
    <li> A step up from the original.  I bought it because I left mine at a hotel while on vaction.  Great power and brushing action.  My dental tech has been commenting since I bought my first, years ago, that my teeth are much cleaner with the use of the sonicare than with the use of a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the slimmer, sleeker design ... and with the more compact base/charger it takes up less space on my tiny bathroom vanity.</li>
    <li> Every time I use this I feel like I have just been to the dentist&#x27;s office to have my teeth professionally cleaned. This technology is awesome. My teeth feel so clean after using a Sonicare because they are clean. The new slender Sonicare doesn&#x27;t lay on the counter very well even though it has a little notch on the back to keep it from rolling on the counter. It stills rolls over easily so that doesn&#x27;t even work. However it is still the same great Sonicare technology so I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars. You have to punch the button 2 times to get it to turn off. I&#x27;m not sure what is accomplished by just punching the button once. That info is probably in the instructions. Plus if you turn it off, the 2 minute cycle starts over so you can&#x27;t interrupt your brushing for a few seconds if needed. The previous model was a little bigger and didn&#x27;t roll on the counter as easliy. New model seems longer too. I did develop a little mouth sensitivity after using this a few weeks or months but the clean is worth it. I have used this for over a decade. I would never be without this unless it&#x27;s the apocalypse and I have no power to charge it.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to splurge on one and considered the disposable types right up to these pricier ones.  I was afraid of purchasing the wrong one considering the amount of money you have to invest.  A hundred dollars or more for a unit compared to 99 cents for a  Reach toothbrush.  Let&#x27;s not forget how pricey the replacement toothbrush heads itself is a major investment.  At first, I considered the Oral-B since it resembled the round heads of a dentist&#x27;s cleaning instrument, but reviews redirected me to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use of the HX6711/02 was rather frightening.  The mere strength of the toothbrush felt like taking a jackhammer to my teeth!  I&#x27;m sure I exerted too much pressure and wasn&#x27;t at all used to the brush.  Regardless, the end result was magnificent!  Clean, like coming from the dentist&#x27;s office, and it felt as if I didn&#x27;t need to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quadpacer feature is great and made me realize that I&#x27;ve had longer brushing sessions with a regular toothbrush and it still didn&#x27;t get my teeth clean as a Sonicare because my teeth definitely felt grungy by the end of the day with a regular toothbrush.  Teeth cleaned by this Sonicare still felt reasonably clean just before bedtime when I had to brush my teeth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra 30 seconds for teeth whitening is a good measure to get your teeth extra clean on the front, which easily starts to grow plaque along the gumline by day&#x27;s end.  Like others, I wish it would start up again in the same mode come next brushing session, but pressing the button twice for teeth whitening mode every time is no big complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with the Pro brush head.  The replacement heads I purchased were the DiamondClean variety.  Both give a good brushing, but my gums seem to feel like it gets a better massage with the Pro head, as well as gets between teeth easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare this to the other units since this is my very first electric toothbrush, but I think this modelhas the best bang for the buck since you can easily find it for less than a hundred bucks.  Happy I made the switch over and excited what the new models will be like in 5 years when I need to shop for another unit.</li>
    <li> I have been stupid enough to purchase multiple of these. It will randomly turn on in the middle of the night. The warranty is VERY short. I purchased about a year and a half ago and is not covered under warranty even though it is a known bug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 5 Sonicare toothbrushes in the past 6 years I am done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for years.  Never failed me yet.  Teeth feel like I just had them cleaned by my dentist.  You will notice after the first time you use it.</li>
    <li> I love my Philips electric toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and it hasn&#x27;t failed me. Easy to recharge and replace the head. Teeth feel so clean, I could never use a regular toothbrush again!</li>
    <li> Love my  Phillips Sonicare.  I didn&#x27;t realize how slow my old one had become until the new one arrived.  It takes 10 days to get used to it as I tend to press a little hard and my mouth is sore, but this goes away after a while.  Haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using Sonicare and would not consider any other brand</li>
    <li> I have had Sonicare toothbrushes in the past.  Having been a dental assistant for many years this was always the brush that was recommended.  After my last Sonicare stopped working I didn&#x27;t rush out to replace it due to cost.  I got by just fine with a manual brush and was just about to purchase a tooth whitening kit when I discovered this Sonicare whitening toothbrush.  I decided to invest the money that I would have paid for the kit, nearly $50, on this toothbrush instead hoping that the whitening it promised would work.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I drink coffee and eat a lot of blueberries and pomegranates so I do need to whiten my teeth from time to time.  I think this brush has done as good a job of removing stains as any whitening kit that I have tried and I don&#x27;t have to worry about using chemicals on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace a 6 year old unit that dies, looked for one that did not have the programs as who needs a tooth massage , ( seriously)&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you just buy the base model so there is less to bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth? They love this sonicare ( and my previous one) My dentist , he says &amp;#34; Darn you Sonicare, Darn you to Hades for developing such a great product&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dental hygenist. Unlike manual tooth brushes, Sonicare gently removes plaque. No more sore gums, and the timer prevents you from over brushing.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this more than I did, the automatic setting goes on for way too long. Not great but not bad.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and, even easier to clean and does a great job. I am completely satisfied and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the second Philips Sonicare I purchased. The first one lasted from March 2012 until the end of the year. The second one lasted even shorter - it died yesterday after about four months. To make things worst, it now vibrates randomly for few seconds at the time, truly annoying in the middle of the night. While I really like this toothbrush when it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s way too expensive to last only four months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to give the Sonicare 5 stars but the head that came with the brush is a bit too small for my taste, the charging base is not heavy enough, and I have lingering questions about how long it will last based on other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself does a wonderful job.  With a manual brush or my Oral-B electric, plaque would start to build up on my lower teeth toward the back.  After a week with the Sonicare all of the plaque was gone.  A couple of weeks later my teeth were a shade or two lighter.  I&#x27;m not talking bleach white but there was certainly a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I saw this for $50 more at my local CVS. I love it! I tell people it&#x27;s the rolls royce of tooth brushes. I&#x27;ve had trouble with my gums and cavitities and my dentist recommended this to prevent future problems.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. My only concersn is that whether or not the warrenty covers overseas as well. Hope so!</li>
    <li> Just starting to use and notice my teeth are getting whiter daily.  A great purchase.  This is the 5th Sonicare I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Garrett</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! This toothbrush is  Light and easy to travel with and has a dentist like feeling after brushing!  Highly recommended without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. Have been using this kind for several years now. Everything is perfect about it except: the battery dies at 2 yrs and there is no way to replace it and the grip could be less slippery when brushing. This is not an inexpensive toothbrush and to have to replace it every 2 yrs does not make me happy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this product has been replaced by a better brush.  It is no longer marketed.  I can&#x27;t find extra brushes that can be used with this older model.</li>
    <li> I love the toothbrush and my dentist noticed a huge improvement in my gums but the thing died in only a year.  I&#x27;m just a few days out of the warranty period and the thing is completely dead.  Won&#x27;t charge, won&#x27;t turn on, nothing.  Really annoying to spend more than $100 on a toothbrush and it barely makes it a year.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great sonic brush with lots of power that holds a charge for a really long time. I&#x27;ve used oral b electric brush&#x27;s as well over the years but I prefer the sonic care..&lt;br /&gt;PS:I have an old sonicare brush from the early 90&#x27;s that still works to this day but haven&#x27;t used in years.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is easy to use and works great! Would recommend it for anyone looking to upgrade their toothbrush to an electric toothbrush. It has a timer so you brush your teeth for the correct amount of time and it lets you know when to move on to the next section of your mouth so all teeth get the same amount of time being brushed. Works much better than a manual toothbrush and definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I debated a long time over which toothbrush to get. This toothbrush provides sonic cleaning and whitening and after using it I don&#x27;t see how any electric toothbrush could do better. Occasionally I get in a hurry and don&#x27;t use the electric toothbrush. I find there is just no way to manually get my teeth as clean as I get with this electric toothbrush. The timer tells you when to switch to the next area and this toothbrush will accommodate the Diamond Clean heads which the higher priced brushes use. The downside is that there is no easy way to pause the unit so basically the unit and your hand becomes covered with toothpaste as you clean your teeth.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the power and accuracy of a Sonicare toothbrush especially for the value. I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes by Philips for nearly a decade now and I have had minimal dental problems because of it. I recommend this toothbrush to everyone for the incredible health benefits it provides.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on numerous toothbrushes before purchasing this one as a gift.  She has complimented on how easy it is to use and reach all areas of her teeth and gums.. Feels like she has been to the dentist after using it.</li>
    <li> The battery is much weaker than my old Sonicare...</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I use this everyday and it makes a huge difference. There is a built in 2 minute timer to keep you brushing long enough, the battery lasts roughly 2 weeks between charges, and your teeth feel so clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended using this to enhance gum health and to more effectively clean the teeth. On first switching, my gums were a bit more sensitive, but this quickly went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing, I have found that these go on steep sale at walgreens - if you live close to one, wait for them to go seventy or eighty dollars on sale</li>
    <li> This is the second Philips toothbrush we&#x27;ve owned and both lasted just a few years (conveniently, just a bit more than the warranty) until they died. Philips offers a small coupon for a new one, but no apologies for a $100 toothbrush that is essentially disposable. I know that this is common with these toothbrushes, and it&#x27;s disturbing that the company (and their customers) are OK with this type of waste and poor products. So much for the company hype about being sustainable, eh?</li>
    <li> Stopped charging after 25 months of use. The Philips warranty lasts 24 months. Quite the coincidence.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a sonicare toothbrush at my last checkup, and at first I was skeptical when I saw how expensive they were, but wow this is completely worth all the money I spent! I can&#x27;t imagine wasting my time using a regular toothbrush again. The timer is also really nice out gives notifications of 30 second interval so you spend the correct amount of time on each quadrant of your mouth. I also love the easily changeable heads, my boyfriend and I both share the same base and the heads are easy to switch and store neatly on the  base. Overall if you&#x27;re like me and are on the fence over the price I say go for it, this toothbrush is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> All four gift recipients liked their new toothbrushes. None of us had used an electric toothbrush before but they really do make your teeth look and feel cleaner. You just need to learn not to open your mouth when brushing! I would definitely recommend this particular one. Only complaint was that it didn&#x27;t come with a travel type cover and it only had one head, despite the packaging having a slot for two heads. Shop around, I got it for $70 but saw it as high as $115.</li>
    <li> A very good toothbrush. Wished that it would last a bit longer.  Head motor lasts about four years. Will purchase two more.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying one of these, however I love it. It really does a nice job cleaning my teeth. It comes with a warranty, so I hope if anything does happen, it happens while its still covered. If not, no big loss. Things aren&#x27;t meant to last anymore.</li>
    <li> I really like this tooth brush. It makes it hard to go back to normal ones after you use it once. Never going back.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, but it lasted just over two years before it stopped working.  How long is the warranty? Two years.</li>
    <li> I used a top-of-the-line Oral B (Braun) electric toothbrush for a couple years, then this Sonicare 710 for the past three years.  I strongly feel the Sonicare is both more enjoyable and more effective.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this toothbrush, it feels like a good quality product.  The biggest problem, for me, is the fact that you have to press and hold the stupid button down for two seconds every time you want to turn it off!  This is just stupid.  I turn my toothbrush on &amp; off a total of three times during the course of each brushing.  Once to spit out all the excess foam that quickly accumulates in my mouth.  A second time when I&#x27;m finished brushing.  And then a third time after I rinse the brush head off in the sink.  Well this is now not nearly as easy as it should be, since every time I want to turn it off I have to do the stupid press-and-hold waiting game.  This might not be THAT big of a deal, but I&#x27;m concerned this is going to eventually wear the button out from having to hold it down so much...my last Sonicare died because the green rubber button tore open allowing water to seep in.  And that model didn&#x27;t even require the 2-second hold!  WHY SONICARE???  Why would you do that?  Honestly, had I known about this before purchasing and using the thing I probably would have gone for an Oral-B instead.  It bothers/concerns me that much.</li>
    <li> It gets my teeth clean with very little effort, I highly recommend it to anyone. Compared to other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used before this product performs amazingly well.</li>
    <li> your company has failed  all of my expectations. I will do my best to encourage others not to trust you</li>
    <li> I ordered the Philips Sonicare healthy white sonic toothbrush - I was amazed to see - that for a product that cost $100 - they couldn&#x27;t even include some additional brush heads - the stand has two little stumps where the addt&#x27;l brushheads go - but you have to pay $20+ for them - chintzy - also, no travel pouch</li>
    <li> I pretty happy with it Overall. It&#x27;s easy to change out the brush attachments and is jot overall loud.  Enjoy your toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so clean. I have never had so much food come out of my teeth from brushing. As gross as that is...I had a sonicare years ago and loved it but couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it until my dentist said make it happen...you need it. I wish I could afford to buy them for my kids.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush broke in less than three months. It is an expensive investment, and so are the brush heads that I purchased along with it. Unfortunately, the brush heads only stay fixed in place for about a week before becoming dismantled from the base while brushing, which results in the heads literally flying off the brush. I had an old E-series Sonicare that was excellent, but this version is clearly not designed for longevity. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a much cheaper electric toothbrush, and I wish I had just purchased this one to begin with! Not only does it clean my teeth really well, but the vibration movement is very comfortable, unlike my old one, which was so rough that it made my entire face tingle when I was using it (not a comfortable sensation). I don&#x27;t know how the toothbrush does it, but it stays remarkably clean without requiring any extra maintenance. There is no mildew anywhere on it, and the shape of the brush or head means that there are practically no drips down the side of the brush. It holds a charge for a really long time (several weeks).</li>
    <li> Owned it for about a year or so, and then it died on me.  I went back to the previous model, which had lasted me i think more than 4 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for months. I love it!</li>
    <li> what a bargain and arrived next day.</li>
    <li> I initially had the sonicare essence and so glad i finally upgraded. This one doesnt have as many groves as the essense for toothpaste to build up into. It stays very clean so long as i rinse it. It fits better in my hand and mouth. I like that you can set it to give you extra seconds for whitening your teeth. But find it lame that they advertise it as whitner compared to the level below this one. All it is, its giving you extra seconds to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt give it five stars because of this, and also because if you forget topush the on button twice when you turn it on, you have to reset the whol time to get the extra seconds for whitenng. It also doesnt beep like my kids sonicare after 30 seconds to switch quadrants, it gives like a second pause instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does the job and its better than brushing!</li>
    <li> I love this electric toothbrush. After using it, it really feels like you just came home for the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product, easy to uses, easy to clean.  After just three uses I could tell my teeth were whiter.  Now the real test---how long will it last.</li>
    <li> Just make sure you use your lesser dominant hand and and barely hold the brush, otherwise, overtime, this brush motor can give you self inflicted cavaties.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model after it gave out.  I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years.  I smoke, drink and rarely floss.  I haven&#x27;t had a single cavity since I started using these (Although I&#x27;ve had very few ever)  Since I started using these the dentist and hygienist always complement my teeth and hygiene, that never happened before.  Before I&#x27;d get speeches about smoking and flossing etc.  If you&#x27;ve ever been on the fence about picking one up I&#x27;d say go for it.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t usually rate a toothbrush.  But, having an old Sonicare that I liked that died, buying a new one after so many years was a little unnerving considering all the choices and prices out there.  Which one is the best for me?  Well, all I can say is that this toothbrush gives me the feeling that I just came from a professional cleaning after every use.  It is astounding!  So, that&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m sticking to it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is pretty good.  Lightweight and powerful.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the silly &#x27;whitening&#x27; mode which seems like a gimmick.  All it does is makes the brushing cycle last a little longer.  If you want to brush for longer, why wouldn&#x27;t you just push the on button again? You have to push it twice to turn on the whitening mode anyway... All in all a great toothbrush though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the E series sonicare toothbrush since 2007 and the only thing that was wrong was the on/off button was peeling.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake and had left it in a hotel while on a trip and was forced to buy an new one.  First impression is that the brush heads are much easier to change.  I always had to clean the stains on the inside of the e series sonicare toothbrush before screwing on a new brush head.  I was happy to find out that this type only required me to pull of the old brush head and do minimal cleaning.  Cleans just as good as the old one and the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; mode is a different but nice touch.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t operate as well as our previous Sonicare of older design. We still use the older design during travels and feel our teeth and gums are much cleaner using that unit.</li>
    <li> I needed a new electric toothbrush and this one sounded like it had what I wanted. It works great,  lets you know when 2 minutes are up.</li>
    <li> I read as many reviews as possible before selecting this particular model. Taking into consideration price, others&#x27; reviews, and product reputation, I bought the Sonicare HealthyWhite 710. So far, so good. My teeth feel as clean everyday as they do right after a professional cleaning. I chose to ramp up the speed immediately instead of letting the programmed adjustment period take place. The instructions tell the use how to do this. The noise that other users talk about has not seemed to bother me. The quadrant timer is pretty cool too. My only concern at this time is that I can see that I am going to have to replace the heads more often than I have with a manual toothbrush. Still, I am happy with this toothbrush and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love it mouth feels clean and fresh like after a dentist cleaning. You also use less toothpaste! Brush  and handle easy to clean after each use.</li>
    <li> I bought for my mom as Christmas gift. She really likes it. It cleans much better than the other electronic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Purchased this brush months ago for myself and had to order another for my parents... This is the most amazing toothbrush ever, I don’t know how I went 27 years without it... Told a coworker about how happy I was with it and the next morning she came in the office saying how she went out and bought one and LOVES it too... definitely worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used these for about a year and find them to be very effective. My dental hygentist commented about how clean my teeth were during my last visit saying that if I did too good a job she wouldn&#x27;t have her job anymore.  If I had a complaint it would be regarding the cost of refills. That seem unreasonably high.....Kind of like the computer printer guys basically giving printers away so that they can charge crazy high prices for ink cartridges.  Regardless I&#x27;d call this a great product and good value.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works. My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have. It can get slippery when wet. My dentist recommended this brand to help with plaque. Very effective, although the price has gone up (I paid $75 in Dec of 2012).</li>
    <li> This item was recommended to my son by his dentist.  He says he actually enjoys using it!  Prompt delivery, very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> I prefer SonicCare to OralB. I&#x27;ve been using one for 12 years now and after reading up, I&#x27;ve gone with the HealthyWhite model for the wider pulse option. My last model lasted me over a decade so I hope this one does too. Just my 2 cents.</li>
    <li> teeth feel as clean as when leaving a dentist office.  this brush replaced an older model and that one was the second soniccare I have purchased.  Now on my third brush in 12 or so years.</li>
    <li> We love the way the Soniccare cleans our teeth and gums! Very impressed with what a diffference it makes after just a few cleanings.</li>
    <li> May I had too high an expectation, this one disappointed me. At first, my gum bled badly, I asked around and everyone said it is normal at first, then I insisted on using it, I just didn&#x27;t see obvious improvement so far.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever.  Bought this one for my girlfriend and she loves it too. Also works well as a personal vibrator.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas present in 2012.  Dead by March 2015.  :(</li>
    <li> When I bought this toothbrush, I thought I was making an unnecessary purchase. However, when I looked online and saw that electric toothbrushes can remove up to 25% more plaque than toothbrushing alone, I figured it should be worth it. After brushing with this my teeth feel as clean as when I leave the dentist. It feels like my teeth were polished or something along those lines. It takes some time to get used to since you don&#x27;t have to do a whole bunch of brushing movements but rather you just glide the toothbrush slowly across the teeth. Also, I never spent two minutes (it has timer set for 2 minutes) brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush but with this toothbrush, sometimes I end up turning it on again and brushing for another minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, my cat finds this toothbrush fascinating and always comes running over as soon as she hears it buzzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I checked out other websites and found that I saved 30-40 bucks buying this from Amazon. Great deal!</li>
    <li> This is a very good electric tooth brush, I have had one for many years and bought this one for a relative.</li>
    <li> So i liked the spin action of those other 8 dollar walmart Spin brushes until I got this. My teeth feel smooth and cleaner than they have ever felt. Never will I go back to the other. If you buy anything, this is what I would suggest you buy.</li>
    <li> No other toothbrush has cleaned my teeth this well. It is easy on my gums and doesn&#x27;t trigger my teeth sensitivity. Love this thing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been doing a great job, can&#x27;t complain. hopefully the battery will last for more then two years, or they will sell replacements  batteries when this one won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have.  Teeth feel much cleaner and my dental checkups have been great.  Good value for the money</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare and I still love the brand.  This one is supposed to whiten teeth and I believe it does.  I haven&#x27;t used any whitening strips in months and my teeth remain white.  I do use whitening tooth paste.</li>
    <li> My dentis may think  its great and my wife may think its  great .. i am not impressed i amgood qabout recharging my tools and not my tooth brush, when i brush my teeth  i want to breally brush my teeth put some good ole fashion buscle behind it and get them clean and not rely on a little elctric motor to do the job, It re minds me of my li-Ion drill and that is why i cannot stand it  in stead of a battery drain it just dies the heads are not cheap and i forget to charge it most times the charging fault is not on the toothbrush but mine but either way i Prefer  a standard  tooth brush to brush my teeth not an electric one that cannot  that diies mid brush :(</li>
    <li> I really like the toothbrush and the shipment was on time would recomment this to my friends and family thankyou</li>
    <li> This is our second one.  They both stopped working in less than 2 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to believe that I was the last person on earth to have one of these. Everyone I tell about this informs me that they already own one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare REALLY makes my mouth feel clean after I brush. It vibrates so very rapidly that it will shock you at first. But, like I mentioned, it really cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do I recommend this, I plan give these as gifts to a few of my family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I bought, the HX6711/02, came with only one brush. The MSRP on a set of four replacement brushes is 30 dollars. However, if you watch the price on Amazon for a short while, you&#x27;ll find them (the genuine Phillips brushes) for around fifteen dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think you&#x27;ll like this</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to brush my teeth before. After using Sconicare, i brushes my teeth 3 times a day. It makes my mouth feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to recommend Sonicare to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush over a year ago, and I am still using it! I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it. I went to the dentist after not going for over a year. He was shocked and asked what I brush with. I told him this, and he said he wished that more would use it. Superior cleaning, quick charges (which last me over 3 weeks), and nice design. I have purchased a 2nd Philips toothbrush for my spouse because I love this so much.</li>
    <li> Bought this after my old sonicare died. It takes adjusting to.&lt;br /&gt;I like the the whitening effect.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t collect the junk the old versions did.</li>
    <li> After 2.5 years, this brush died on me.  It was weird.  I left it on the charger, and after a while it started buzzing/vibrating...one long buzz followed by a two short ones in quick succession.  When I picked it up to see what happened, it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  Not sure how common this is.  It was great while it lasted.  I&#x27;ll be getting another Sonicare for my next brush.  I&#x27;m deducting one star because I thought it would last longer than it did.  Leaves your teeth feeling super-clean.  Long-lasting battery.</li>
    <li> works as promised.. only thing is the replacement heads are a little on the expensive side, but I like the toothbrush so much that it doesn&#x27;t deter me from continuing to use it.  keeps the placque and tarter buildup down</li>
    <li> It buzzes you through brushing the four areas of your teeth (inner lowers, outer lowers, inner uppers, outer uppers) and has a second setting that allows you to spend an extra 15s on your front top teeth, and on your front bottom teeth for an extra white smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the stand, I love the toothbrush. My mouth always feels so clean and my gums are always nicely massaged. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is my first sonicare toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and so far it has been great.  Every time I use it I feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.  My gums actually bled a little bit the first few times using it since it was so powerful, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and don&#x27;t have any problems.  The extra 30 seconds at the end are used for whitening the front teeth, and it seems to be doing a good job.  I used a crest spinbrush for years before this, and I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
    <li> The cleanest feel after brushing! The small brush head lets me get to my back molars with ease. Very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I had my last Sonicare toothbrush for close to 12 years before it gave up the ghost. I love the new one....sleeker, lighter, and super clean teeth.</li>
    <li> Already had one, needed another..blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah (15 words).</li>
    <li> My husband has this tooth brush and told me I needed to change brands.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay what he did at the dentist&#x27;s office.  Found this model that fits my needs.  My teeth and gums are in better shape in just three weeks.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this toothbrush via recommendation of my dental hygienist.  I was hesitant at first because I liked to brush my teeth while taking a shower. Well needless to say, I now look forward to brushing my teeth for 2 minutes right before my shower. I like it a lot better than brushing. I feel it&#x27;s such a perfect toothbrush.  I could prob even take it in the shower if I wanted but since its just a two minute deal I don&#x27;t want to risk messing up my toothbrush. I feel it was a very good investment.</li>
    <li> I had the Elite 7800 in use for the last 10 years, with 2 people using on a regular basis. I never had a bit of trouble other than, the older I got, the harder it was to swap brush heads. My grandkids came over with the newer style head that slipped on &amp; off. I seen right then what I needed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I kept thinking that the Elite would eventually die, but I finally retired it to the goodwell.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the HX6711/02 was the features were very similar to the Elite. This one is guaranteed 2 years &amp; if you register it Phillips adds another 6 months making 30 months warranty. Based on how long the first lasted, I&#x27;m sure to get my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;It gets my teeth just as clean as before, so I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described.  I love using it everyday. Highly recommend!  Sonicare makes a really really good product.</li>
    <li> I love the auto timer feature. Already after a few weeks I can see my teeth are a couple shades whiter(heavy coffee drinker). Great product. I will never go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.  The brush head is small, so it gets the very back of teeth very easily.  It also prevents the brusher from applying too much pressure when brushing.  I also like the snap on brush head cover which covers the brush, but also has vents to allow the brush to dry.  I wish I had purchased this toothbrush years ago.</li>
    <li> This one is so much better than the other one I had from Philips which had the thicker handle. First of all the charge is great I charged it up fully after getting it and it been over 2 weeks and I still don&#x27;t need a charge. It might just be because it is new the brush moves so much faster than the old one.</li>
    <li> For the last 20 years I have used a Sonicare to brush my teeth which are now cleaner and whiter, with healthier gums,  than they were with the old standard toothbrush.  This rechargeable, electric toothbrush functions much like the last one I had.  Unfortunately, this model does not last as long as the first Sonicare that I had.  The first one lasted about 12  years, and I had the battery changed twice.  When I could no longer get the battery changed on that model, I went to the Sonicare HX6711/02/02 Healthy/White 710 which seems to have a lifespan of about 3-5 years, and as you may have guessed, the batteries cannot be changed.  When the battery is dead, you have to buy a whole new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Just bought this a month ago, all I can say is I&#x27;m happy with it &amp; my teeth feel very clean</li>
    <li> Took a little getting used to the vibration of this brush, but I like it even better than my previous Braun.  Feels  like a more thorough cleaning.  My dentist noticed the difference:  that says it all.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel the way they do after a dentist&#x27;s cleaning, even the back where tarter tends to build up.  I like th option of 30 extra seconds at a slower speed for the the front teeth.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my ten your old sonicare and bought this new one.  It&#x27;s great and the whitening feature works well.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> and is is small (smaller diameter than the last one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous two Sonicare&#x27;s had no model number so, the last one was hard to replace just the handle... now I have an extra E-series brush that is now useless.  :-(</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s wonderful.  like going to the dentist every time you brush your teeth.  i&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ve lived without it!</li>
    <li> Bought this brush and used it for 6 months with glowing results, along with my wife and 2 young daughters, before the metal shaft at the top literally came out. Tried pushing it back in which worked for awhile, but then it came out and wouldn&#x27;t go back in - and started going off on its own while on the charger. I read a number of the reviews here about the awful customer service, and was thinking about not calling and just replacing the brush, but at the price I wanted to at least give it a try. The rep I contacted (got through immediately) was very courteous, asked a few usage questions, and then shipped a replacement while I was on the phone - asking me to send the old one in once I got the new one. Not only did it arrive in a few days, but they had upgraded the brush to the sensitive tooth one which is much more stable and solid. No issues to date with that model.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush because it make brushing your teeth fun. Also, it makes your brush for a full two minutes and leaves your teeth totally clean. I like the small brush head. It is easy to put on and take off. This toothbrush is great for traveling because it keeps its charge for over a week even when you use it three times a day and also comes with a small charger base that is easy to pack and barely takes any space.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without my Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Great job cleaning teeth. Had to get accustomed to the vibration--it was ticklish to begin with, but I&#x27;m fine now.</li>
    <li> Im not sure how many years it has been since I purchased this item, but I couldnt imagine not having my sonicare. Still going strong , and have never had an issue. Ive converted my girlfriend to a sonicare with very little hesitation.</li>
    <li> This no-frills toothbrush works great. Has a change in vibration every 30 seconds so you can switch brushing zones. Holds a charge for about a week (or more) at a time. I have to use soft bristled heads, which I have found difficult to find in stores (easy to order online). Great product that does exactly what it is designed to and claims to.</li>
    <li> Works ok at home  where it can be plugged in all of the time.  Worthless for short road trips where you want it to work for a few days without recharging.  Only holds a charge for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought this when the battery in my old Essence model finally died after 7 years. I did a lot of comparing the different models and chose this one because I didn&#x27;t care about any of the extra features in the more expensive offerings. (in a way, you&#x27;ve got to feel sorry  for the Sonicare marketeers - trying to differentiate an entire product line for a toothbrush. Holy cow! It&#x27;s a toothbrush! Guess what, they all brush teeth. Anyway...) I like this one better than the old model I had:&lt;br /&gt;A) it actually seems to clean my teeth better. I think Sonicare may have a new generation of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;B) the brush attachment is simpler and way easier to clean. Instead of the old hard-to-clean giant plastic nut with all the threads to catch and grow dental micro-organisms, there&#x27;s just a metal shaft to plug into a small socket. Quick and easy to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;C) likewise, the body no longer has the matching threads or that deep well and is much easier to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;D) both brush and body are easier to store in the medicine cabinet. Before I used the brush holder that was in a pack of two replacement brushes on top of a lid from pringles can to catch the run-off. I threw all that away and they just sit on the shelf now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m entirely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t help you compare to any of the other contemporary models since this is the only new one I bought and I plan to keep it until it dies like its predecessor.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot live without this toothbrush.  My old Sonicare gave out and I ordered this one and had it within about 5 days.  Since I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes, my teeth and gums are the healthiest they have ever been.  My dentist and dental hygienist are complimentary of the overall condition of my teeth and gums.  (I also floss daily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend a Sonicare toothbrush if you want to see an overall improvement in your dental health.</li>
    <li> The philips sonicare toothbrush is a great product. It works well and the batteries last for day&#x27;s. This is a replacement for one that I had for several years, that I finally wore out. 2 months after I started using the last one. My dental hygentist asked me if I was doing something different. She said my teeth and gums looked great and when I told her I had started using the sonicare. She said that was the toothe brush she recommended. I recommended it also!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does everything the advertising says. My teeth get cleaner faster than anything I have ever had. I had the original version until it just died of old age. The new version is much better in every way. My dentist told me that if I was tired of the expensive work I have had in the last few years I should buy a Sonicare. I did, and could not be happier. {Don&#x27;t even think of saving a few dollars by buying the basic model.}</li>
    <li> I purchased this about two years ago and the betteries died.  They will charge but will not last the length of time needed to clean my teeth.  There is a third party company that sells the entire base for $60.  I only paid $70 for the brush.  I don&#x27;t understand why the batteries cannot be changed.  But this is a big let-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it two stars for a decent clean.  But it is basiscally a disposal.</li>
    <li> The battery in my 6 year old Sonicare Elite finally went out. I tried going back to a manual toothbrush for a couple of days. No way.  I&#x27;m used to the 30-second notice during the 2 minute brushing session, and this model looked promising.  No problems at all.  Great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Since I began using the Sonicare, my dentist said the health of my teeth has improved considerably.  My gums have always bled when I brushed or flossed, no matter how frequently or correctly I did it.  This stopped within two weeks of switching to the Sonicare.  I was scheduled two months out for a two-phase debriding and cleaning treatment, but when I arrived for the first appointment, the hygienist inspected my teeth and said I only needed a basic cleaning.  I was extremely happy with this as it saved me time and money I would have spent on taking off work for a second appointment and the associated dental bill.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I bought and LOVE this product, but the battery charger light went out 4 months short of the 2 years. I called Sonicare and without any problems, they are sending me a new brush. I just need to return the old one with a prepaid envelope.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Great return policy. Great price. Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for keeping records of my purchases as I threw away the original box and papers!!</li>
    <li> love the new updated version. I had the old heavy one, however it has lasted forever and actually still works.</li>
    <li> My only problem is the cost of the replacement brushes. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good brush. Makes your teeth feel almost polished.</li>
    <li> My wife swears to sonicare tooth brush, her tooth brush&#x27;s battery died one month before the 2 year warranty, battery would not hold for a full charge, and they replaced it free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with flossing, the tooth brush keeps your gum and tooth beautiful and healthy, no doubt about it.</li>
    <li> As many others have commented, I too have had problems with this toothbrush, BUT I liked it so much, I bought another one anyway. When I got it in the mail, I noticed an important improvement: over the rubber gasket where the brush connects to the handle they have added a hard piece of plastic that was not there on my last brush. I too had problems where the rubber gasket fell apart after about 2-3 years causing the toothbrush motor to stop working. The rubber gasket is still there though, so here is the key recommendation to preventing it from mil dewing away: remove the brush head at least overnight, if not after each brushing. That should help. For those that had problems with the battery, I never had this. But like any lithium battery, don&#x27;t keep it on the charger all the time (or at least don&#x27;t keep it plugged in all the time). I have had 4 Sonicares and never experienced your problem because I always did this. Now, after the first 8 years of using the Advance, yes, the battery would only last 5-7 days, but after a full charge, I always unplug the charger and wait till the battery is about dead before charging it again. Good luck, this is definitely a great toothbrush and with a little extra precaution I am hoping it will last well past the 3 years my last one did. I give it 4 stars because I do have to take the extra precaution. BUT, it is as quite as ever, even with the extra plastic and after 2 days of brushing with a normal toothbrush, I am SO happy to feel that Sonicare fresh feeling again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember when I first started using it, my dentist noted immediately that I was doing something different. Teeth were cleaner, had less plaque if any at all, fewer, if any, cavities and my gum pockets were all within the good range.  This brush has definitely been a great investment!!!</li>
    <li> My dentist said to switch to the Oral B regular handle with Floss Action heads (most important thing) and he was right. Much cheaper and they clean better- you can feel it. I also like how they don&#x27;t turn off after 2 minutes like all Sonicare brushes do- OralB also has quadpacer but stays on until you turn it off manually. My OralB $29 handle didn&#x27;t last as long but these Sonicares go out every 2 years like clockwork. Again, I go slower and take longer than the 2 minutes but I&#x27;ve had 2 of the most expensive Sonicare models (3 mode flexcare) and this cheaper $90 handle- none lasted longer than 2 years. The batter doesn&#x27;t last as long between charges on the OralB and they&#x27;re a little bulkier. Floss Action heads on any OralB brush beats Sonicare IMO and my dentist says less tarter buildup when I go in for cleanings! I didn&#x27;t notice any of the 4 different models (2 Sonicare and 2 OralB) making a difference in cleaning or whiting compared to cheaper model/same brand. Bleaching your teeth white is bad people!</li>
    <li> I have been thinking about getting a sonic care toothbrush for embarrassingly, years! and I finally broke down and bought one because this is a really good deal; value for the money spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth and keeping them white. They feel so clean, it is like I have been to the dentist for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If clean teeth are important to you, buy this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Been using these for over 15 years and my dentist is very pleased with my results. I find that they last longer if I charge only when needed. A few years ago I remarried. My wife was using a different brand that required charging every other day. I bought her a Sonicare and she was amazed at the improvement in brushing and her dentist has also noticed a difference. We brush twice a day with the Sonicare and only recharge every three to four weeks.</li>
    <li> I really like the Sonicare rechargeable toothbrush. It works very well, and my teeth feel so clean after use. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The only reason I did not give 5 stars is this product lasted exactly 3 years.  I would have liked if it lasted at least 5 years. The warranty is only for 2 years.</li>
    <li> This is my second philips sonicare rechargeable toothbrush.  The only reason I bought a new one was that after 10years of everyday use, the old one died.  This one is more powerful and a narrower hand grip.  The narrow hand grip is nice for me--much easier to hang onto as you are manipulating over the differant areas in your mouth.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend any of the sonicare products----just pick the right one for you and your family.</li>
    <li> I have had Sonicare products for a few years and as you&#x27;ll see in a simple Internet search, the products have gotten cheaper and cheaper.  Now the batteries only last a few months and can not be replaced.  Never again for this product!</li>
    <li> It works really well, and my teeth feel cleaner longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to have had a travel carry case for it though.</li>
    <li> It cleans like a hygienist would and definitely helps to whiten.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone can benefit from this products.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> I am used to the previous E model that I liked very much. This one seems fragile, but  it does a good job so far.</li>
    <li> I love this sonic toothbrush. It replaced a previous one I had that had stop working after 5 years. This is an upgraded to that one and it is awesome.</li>
    <li> The design and operation of this toothbrush is excellent.  I just wish it was reliable.  What has consistently happened is that after 6-10 months the toothbrush begins to operate erratically, then not at all.  Actually, it is funny.  The first sign of failure frequently came when the toothbrush would suddenly turn itself on with no one around it.  I would hear this funny vibration-like noise coming from the bathroom and find it operating on its own.  Or it would not respond to the power button when I wanted to turn it off.  All the failure modes were the same:  the electric control circuit would fail, most likely because water would seep into the handle and short it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Philips Sonicare customer service each time and they have been excellent in their response, replacing tooth brushes under warranty without any hassle.  I love the product but just couldn&#x27;t keep it operational despite taking care not to get the handle too wet (which is almost impossible to do since toothpaste residue builds up on the face where the removable brush attaches and it needs to be cleaned off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given up on this model and have switched to the (less expensive) Essence design, which I also like but haven&#x27;t used long enough to comment on my experience with its reliability.</li>
    <li> I had a sonicare toothbrush and liked it very much but it was wearing out after many years of service.  I wanted a new one that beeped every thirty seconds and did a better job.  I am very happy with it, my teeth are whiter and smoother with this brush.  Yes, I would recommend the Sonicare to anyone that asks.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is amazing!! It works so well and it was worth the money.. I also saw the same tooth brush at target and realized that I got mine 20 bucks cheaper! Very happy!</li>
    <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and I bought it because of the positive reviews.  It didn&#x27;t disappoint; this toothbrush is slim, light and easy to keep clean.  The only minor downside is having to press the power button twice to get to the &amp;#34;Clean and White&amp;#34; function, which I feel should just be the default.  Other than that - it&#x27;s great.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean!!! Brushing with a regular toothbrush is for the birds! I&#x27;m looking forward to my next dentist&#x27;s visit because now I have been able to brush my teeth at the suggested 45 degree angle effectively and my teeth and gum line feel and look great. A great product at a great price with a coupons for more products too (the replacement heads and the flosser).</li>
    <li> Nice, simple toothbrush.  Highly recommend.  Had one with all the bells and whistles - none of which I ever used - so went back to the simple one - very happy.</li>
    <li> So far so good. TaKes getting used to, as it really vibrates&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth. But you will enjoy it as you use it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband and he loves it. I already had one of my own and he kept trying to steal it so I purchased him one so he would keep away from mine. We both have better dental checkups since we started to use this, awesome product.</li>
