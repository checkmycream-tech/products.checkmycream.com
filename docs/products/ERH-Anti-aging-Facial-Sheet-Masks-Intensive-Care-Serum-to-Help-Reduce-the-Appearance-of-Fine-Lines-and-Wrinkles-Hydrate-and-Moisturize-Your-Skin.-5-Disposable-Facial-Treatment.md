<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> While this did leave my face soft, I had a couple of issues with the masks. One, the eye holes are too small. During the time I left the mask on the mask touched the outside of my left eye and would burn like it was getting in my eye. If I moved it the same happened on the right. I tried to cut the eye holes bigger but my scissors couldn&#x27;t cut through the moisture. My solution was I had to keep my eyes closed for the whole thing or my eye would start burning again. Two, I have slightly sensitive skin so the whole mask itched my skin. By 15 minutes the itching was getting unbearable so I took the mask off and instead of being able to rub the essence in, I had to wipe it off to stop the itching. My face did feel softer after. I would recommend this to you if you have small eyes and non sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My skin felt unbelievably smooth after using this mask.</li>
    <li> Love this. Feels nice on your face and especially when you remove it. If i could I would do it everyday but I plan to do it once a week</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, my wife tried it and she loves it, it made her skin looks more bright, very good product.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite masks ever!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for girls weekend. Everyone loved them.</li>
    <li> loved its , so easy to use</li>
    <li> They had a very relaxing scent. Once I opened up a packet, it was a bit different that other masks. Instead of having to peel the folded mask from itself, there was a layer of film that helped unfold it for each use. After trying the mask for 15 minutes, I took it off and wipes up the excess. It left my skin softer and brighter. Perfect for me This mask is a little different than what I have used prior. It is like a film but same as others you peel off and place on your face. Sometimes they slide and you have to adjust it but if you lay still and relax they won&#x27;t. After using one, you immediately notice how soft your skin is and how moisturized it is. It says use 2-3 times weekly I used 2 so far and have had no irritation. I&#x27;m sure with continued use that my fine lines will fade because my skin looks really good after using just 2 times. I was extremely happy to review this product for the price I got it at I definitely got a great deal love it</li>
    <li> I decided on a spa day a couple days ago and decided on getting a massage and just having a day to myself. My place did not have an availability for a facial and i decided when i got home I would try my facial in a pack. I have combination skin and am very prone to acne and many products create blemishes. First of all, the mask had this very light smell, very refreshing. I cleaned my face really good and exfoliated and then used the mask cold. Left it on for 15 min hoping the cold will help my eye puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I removed it left a small amount on my skin and I just rubbed it in like the instructions said. Will start using this 2-3x a week and I love that I am not going to have to worry with scheduling a facial. I have my own right at home! I was able to buy this product during a promotion and am happy to share my experience with it.</li>
    <li> I am 27 years old and starting to see some signs of aging, so anti-aging masks have started to become my best friends. I really like how this mask is so simple to use. It did not stick to itself like some of the other masks I have used in the past. I love the cooling feeling of the mask as it dries – it really feels like it is actually doing something. The mask does not have any weird smells to it, and was very easy to apply to my face. I had a little bit of problems with it trying to slide around at first but it stopped doing so pretty quickly. I kept it on my face for 20 minutes. It was easy to remove and only left a little bit of sticky stuff on my face that was easy to get off. My face felt so much softer and rejuvenated after taking off the mask! I was given a chance to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion. I am very happy I got to try it. I will be using the rest of the masks and buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> Love these masks.  Refreshing and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive son skin.  I did notice some irritation around my eyes.  I&#x27;ll trim the eye holes a bit more before using again.  Irritation did go away immediately when mask was removed. For first use,  I&#x27;d not leave on entire 20 min dude to possible skin issues.</li>
    <li> This mask makes your face feel amazing!  It is so easy to use and leaves no mess.  Your skin feels very tight and moist after taking this off.  I would recommend this for people who travel a lot and don&#x27;t want to sacrifice their beauty regimen.  The packaging is high quality (no leaking, doesn&#x27;t tear open easily) - this would definitely travel well.</li>
    <li> These masks are wonderful! They are extremely easy to use. I have used them once a week and they have left my skin soft as can be!</li>
    <li> I love these, they make my face look young again.</li>
    <li> I have some creases in between my brows. I left this on as I was watching one of my television shows - 60 minutes. I took it off rubbed in the rest and went to sleep. When I woke up, the creases were GONE! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! This stuff is amazing! Before you think I am talking about a miracle, the creases were not very deep. However, some deeper wrinkles that I have on my forehead had a noticeably smoother appearance. I will definitely buy this product again and again!</li>
    <li> You know a product is great when you are squeezing out the last few drops of the serum out of the packet! I love love love this mask! I use the excess from the packet on my neck and upper chest.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this twice so far and I cant wait to get more once I use the last of these, my skin feels firmer, looks more radiant, it gives me a little glow. Plus I love how with this mask you dont have to rinse off your face afterwards, just rub the excess serum in when you remove the paper mask. I havent found anything that compares to this on the market. I use a regular face moisturizer after using the mask as recommended to lock in the moisture. Great masks! Well worth the price and beyond! :)</li>
    <li> I am an avid consumer of facial masks.  Whether it&#x27;s from Amazon, Nordstroms, or my esthetician, I have had my fair share of good, beautiful, and &amp;#34;did anything happen?&amp;#34; masks.  While this mask was very cool on my face and felt moisturizing, I don&#x27;t feel that this mask worked as well or better than the others I&#x27;ve tried. Overall, the mask is a nice skin regimen but nothing that extraordinary. The moisture is apparent while on but overnight, my skin felt dry when I woke up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I purchased this product at a discount for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Relaxing, soothing, decadent. Spoil yourself with these! It is definitely worth it! They don&#x27;t skimp on the amount of serum, or the quality of the mask. I use to use the mask from ItWorks, but this one is soooo much better! The material of the mask is thicker, the stuff is on both sides of the mask so you can flip it over and use the other side. I love these masks!</li>
    <li> This is one of the famous brands of facial mask in Taiwan. I really like the thin fabric of the mask but the thick serum in it, which makes my skin soft and fully moisturized after using it. Thank you ERH Group for the wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Feels great on your face! I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> They provided what they said when they said they would.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product.  When I ordered I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect since I haven&#x27;t tried masks like these before.  The mask package is really squishy which I took to mean the mask was very moist and it was.  I opened the envelope and unfolded the mask.  It says to avoid eyes but that is actually kind of difficult.  I placed the mask on my face but it was really hard to get it positioned so that it wasn&#x27;t in my eyes or mouth.  I then realized that I needed to remove the plastic topping.  Once I did I was able to move the mask around better and it better adhered to my face.  It gave me a very cooling sensation that was very soothing and relaxing.  After 20 minutes I removed the mask and massaged the remaining cream on my face.  There was a lot left on my face so I used a towel to dab some of it off.  My face felt really soft after using this.  I really liked it.  I deducted a star for lack of good directions and for a poor fit.</li>
    <li> Product was just as described left skin feeling good</li>
    <li> I will need a few more uses for a final review, but so far I really like them.  Getting the mask to stay in place was a little difficult.  The mask felt so calming and relaxing while in place for 15 minutes. After removing the mask, there was so much product left on the skin to massage into my face, and it felt so moisturizing and my skin felt so soft.  I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, however myskin did look better.</li>
    <li> Great. Makes my skin silky smooth</li>
    <li> I received these in the mail yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them. I like how they come individually wrapped and have a plastic wrap around it to make it easy to apply. I found it easy to apply and rub on and smooth out to get a perfect fit. Once the mask was on it didn&#x27;t move at all. Right from the beginning it had a nice cooling effect and was really relaxing. I left the mask on for 20 mins and it was easy to remove. I rubbed the remaining essence into my face and neck and it left my face feeling nice and soft. I have sensitive skin and I was worried that this product might irritate my skin but I was worried for no reason. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I put a hand towel on my pillow then put this mask on and relaxes on the bed. These are very easy to use and made my face feel great.</li>
    <li> This i is a nice mask that leaves your face feeling soft after using. I really like it when i&#x27;m feeling extra warm because they have a cooling effect. Pretty classy that they&#x27;re made with real gold, too! My face looked great after using these and my skin felt nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> These mask are amazing. It&#x27;s like going to the spa without leaving your home. I only do it once a week but it&#x27;s such a treat. I can&#x27;t wait until the next</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Worked wonderfully</li>
    <li> I was home all day so I tried the mask and after 10 hours my skin STILL feels soft and moisturized. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this. I figured it was gimmicky, boy was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package it is very wet, but that aids in the mask sticking to your face. It was surprisingly cool on my face. After the 20 minutes I took the mask off and rubbed the remainder in my face as the directions suggest. But, because the mask still had so much moisture in it, I took the mask and rubbed it on my neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage for added treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleasantly pleased with this product. It is definitely a nice once per week pamper treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ERH Group provided this product for my review and feedback.</li>
    <li> This feels so, so, so good! You have to try this! I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> To start, I use Retin-A on a regular basis so my skin is pretty sensitive. I was concerned I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this product for that reason. While it did burn slightly, it wasn&#x27;t too bad and once the serum was massaged in it felt great and there was no redness. The next morning I noticed my windburn (spring break at the zoo and various parks) peeling was gone. I also noticed the skin at the top of my cheek bones to the outer corners of my eyes was very smooth and my skin tone was more even. This mask is for your face what a quality hair mask is to your hair: deep moisturizing and repairs damage without being oily or too heavy. It is a bit of a pain to use as it has quite a bit of serum on the mask, but once it is in place it is no hassle. It needs to be done at night, it won&#x27;t do well under make-up. Over all a great hydrating mask! *Sample Provided at Discount*</li>
    <li> Very comforting, full of &amp;#34;good stuff&amp;#34;. And I love the &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; too</li>
    <li> Love this product! Have to fit over your face just right though, be careful  with this lol my skin looked great after the first use!</li>
    <li> This is a very quick and easy way to give yourself a nice hydrating facial with no mess. You just apply the mask to your face and it will stick to your face. It has a cooling sort of feel to it. Then wait for 15-20 minutes before removing the mask. Your face will feel much more moisturized than before. I love the way this feels on my skin. I also love knowing that it is giving my skin nutrients it really needs. I usually lie down and watch some TV while I let the mask do its work. My skin easily absorbed the moisture and it leaves no greasy feeling or residue. This box comes with five facial masks. I bought this product with a discount and I am so happy with it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product and really feel a difference in my skin after using. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in it.  Don&#x27;t know if it would benifit my face as I got tired of the struggle and put it back into the package to try again later.&lt;br /&gt;The mask is hard on the outside and will not adapt to the face to keep the product on the surface of the skin. It was popping up in many places. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again &amp; wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderful, perfect fit. As there are some brands that I bought the cut is so bad, about 1/4 of skin is expose or the eye is cracked. Is really moist, I could still use it on my neck or arm after uses on my face and the fluid inside bag can be wipe on neck and arm. The mask itself is really thick, face feels really hydrated after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
    <li> I really like these masks. They are super easy to use, they leave your skin feeling refreshed and velvety.They are not too soaked that you make a mess, either. These are just perfect. I like the glow on my skin after each use.</li>
    <li> I dont let a drop go to waste! I put this soaked (paper?) mask on my face and even squeeze out any excess liquid from inside the packet and put on my neck and even my chestline. my skin feels renewed after these masks, they have changed my outlook on these styles of masks. going to even talk my husband into trying one :)</li>
    <li> The mask had a great smell. It took a bit for me to figure out how to put it on but that could be just me. my skin was very soft after using this. I have only used it one time so far but looking forward to using it again.</li>
    <li> I love these anti-aging facial masks!  If you have dry skin, (mine gets so dry it burns and hurts) try these!  The deep moisturizing these masks bring are wonderful!  My skin looks hydrated and smooth after using them!</li>
    <li> This felt so nice.  Like a spa treatment at home.  First it was easy to apply because it unfolds to a face shape.  Just line it up, press it on and peel off the outside layer.  The smell was so pleasant and stays on after removal since you rub any excess in to your skin.  My skin looks great and feels tight after the first use.</li>
    <li> Used the first mask tonight. The mask has a tingling effect while you are wearing it I really enjoy this mask it fits my face alot better than other products similar that usually fail in the chin area this one fits great.</li>
    <li> Highly recommand it! It will be on my must buy list.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great after I use these masks!</li>
    <li> Moisturizing and very cooling for anyone with sensitive skin. Make sure you cleanse face well before with warm water to open pores and then apply to face. Nice application and comes with extra in bag to apply to rest of skin.</li>
    <li> Sit back, throw on a mask, and relax. Well, after scaring the day lights out of your kids, of course! Easy to apply, great results. Skin feels softer immediately and still feels just as soft after a rough night of sleep.</li>
    <li> I love this face mask. Its hard to put on at first because it feels like its sliding off, but its so refreshing once i leave it on for about 20 minutes</li>
    <li> Purchased to review product.  So far I&#x27;ve used one mask.  The part that goes around the eyes is a bit uncomfortable.  I feel like the holes should be larger.  The mask feels slippery at first.  The residue become a bit sticky after removing the mask.  I did realize my skin appeared refreshed and extremely moisturized.  The mask didn&#x27;t make my skin feel tighter which I was hoping for!  I will continue to use the remainder 4 masks to see if there will be additional benefits!</li>
    <li> these made my face feel amazing and fresh after use i love to use these after i use a harsh clay mask it really soothes my skin.</li>
    <li> Very soothing and moisturizing! I applied this after going to sauna and taking a shower and it was the best night of the year :-)&lt;br /&gt;Chilling it a little bit will feel awesome on summer nights!</li>
    <li> Love these! Makes your skin feel so silky afterward. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!!! Smells great, left on for more than 20 minutes, until an episode of my show was finished. I took it off and rubbed the excess in like it says in the instructions and it moisturized my skin so much. It felt so soft and refreshed. I don&#x27;t get out much so this was like a spa day at home. Can&#x27;t wait to do it again!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Face felt refreshed after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far. My skin felt smoother and very hydrated. I will keep using.</li>
    <li> I Love these masks! They are so nice &amp; easy to use too!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product line! The masks are of a thin fabric type material and fits great when pressed onto my face. Wait 20 minutes and take it off. There is just enough solution in the masks that when I take them off it dries quickly. My face is super soft and moisturized and feels amazing. The softness lasts a few days to a week. My make up seems to glide on more smoothly after as well.</li>
    <li> These masks are wonderful! They are extremely easy to use.  I have sensitive skin and find it hard to buy new facial products.  After using this product I am extremely happy with the results.  My skin was so soft after using the product and it did not cause any irritation. very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent item, speedy shipping, thanks.A+++</li>
    <li> These are great masks. They are very easy to use, and the directions are very straight forward. Fast shipping and great price.</li>
    <li> I have used a few of these masks and I really like how they make my face feel.  They are very easy to use and once you take the mask off, I just used the extra serum and rubbed it on my neck.  My skin feels super soft after I use this mask.  I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> I really do love using these, just once a week for 15 minutes is all you need and your skin feels great afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the original formula masks, and the anti-oxidant hydration formula masks that this company offers. Out of the three I prefer the anti-oxidant hydration masks the best.  Since the original mask first came out the company has improved a bit on the design. They have added small slits in the corners of the eyes to allow a better fit for people that have larger eyes, or a wider eye set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if these aren&#x27;t as intense as the hydration formula, these masks do still hydrate your skin leaving it moisturized and feeling soft and supple. When your skin is moisturized it puffs up a bit so you also get the added bonus of diminished fine lines and wrinkles which make you look so much better. I&#x27;m at the age now where I&#x27;ll take any help I can get! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wearing these for 15 minutes, I rub the excess serum into my face and neck area. What&#x27;s left on the mask I rub into my arms and legs, paying more attention to my elbows, feet, and the back of my hands. I do love using these masks and once you get them positioned on your face they hold pretty well as long as you aren&#x27;t smiling or talking too much. I&#x27;ve even worn them while washing the dishes. These are a very nice once a week skin treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample received for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and my skin looks and feels fantastic afterwards. I glow and my face feels and looks younger! Worth trying!</li>
    <li> I gave it a high expectation because of the review and Taiwanese sheet masks are usually very good. This mask costs five times more than what I normally purchase on Amazon so I thought it must be superior. Apparently I was wrong. It irritated my eyes when I first put the mask on. There was water coming out from my eyes though I felt ok after couple minutes. During the treatment, I had to keep adjusting the mask because it was very slippery and couldn&#x27;t stay on my face properly. My face did feel a little softer after the application but any cheaper mask can provide the same or even better result.  Overall it&#x27;s a huge disappointment for me. But Lesson learned at least, high price does not necessarily equal high quality.</li>
    <li> Loved the mask . Very easy to use and mess free:) skin felt very hydrated, supple . Great .</li>
    <li> These masks come individually wrapped. The packs are gold in color but the masks themselves are white. Once unwrapped and placed on the face, the scent mixed with the feel of the mask should give off a calming feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product sent for purpose of review</li>
    <li> I am rating based on first use and cannot speak to longterm results yet but I will use the whole package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my first mask yesterday and we all tend to worry about trying a new face product. No irritation at all and I kept it on for a full 15 minutes and rubbed in the excess product when I was done. I like that most of the ingredient list is natural products and things I can pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture had me a little worried that there was a white hard plastic mask to put on my face over the product, but that is not the case. Each gold pouch has a very thin papery mask on a thicker backing that you peel off after the mask is placed on your face with the holes lining up over you eyes, mouth and nose. My skin felt very soft after the product was all absorbed and was still feeling nicer this morning so I would call application #1 a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of product on the mask and in the package, you could possibly use each mask 2x if you save it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are not worried about aging, they offer other types that address other skin issues. I was offered the chance to try these out at a discount for use and an honest review.</li>
    <li> I will defintely be re-ordering these! They are simply amazing! My skin was super dry under my eyes &amp; forehead. This made my skin look and feel like a million bucks! The crepiness under my eyes is gone &amp; my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I love to pamper myself with deep hydrating/anti-aging facial masks. After all, why do I need to spend a fortune on spa treatments when I can have that spa experience in the comfort and privacy of my own home. I received this particular mask at a special price for the purposes of product testing and reviewing. Everything contained in this review is my own personal experience using this mask.&lt;br /&gt;First I made sure my face was freshly washed and found a quiet area where I could apply the mask and lay back and relax for 20 minutes. By quiet area, I mean I made sure I was home alone so no one would bother me, I turned the television off and played some soft soothing music to relax myself and to really give myself that spa experience.&lt;br /&gt;Applying the mask was super simple and it completely fit all the contours of my face evenly. Thereby giving my face all the wonderful benefits of this rich hydrating formula. Then I just relaxed and let the mask do all the work. I have sensitive skin and was pleased that the all natural ingredients in this mask did not irritate my sensitive skin what so ever. In fact, it actually helped improve the look and feel of my skin after just one use. After the 20 minutes were up, I was amazed at how soft and hydrated my skin felt. I had no idea I had let my skin get that dry. I plan on taking time out for myself at least once a week to give myself a deep hydrating, anti-aging mask. After all, the key to younger looking skin, is keeping it well hydrated. I love these masks and would also recommend them. They make you feel great afterward!</li>
    <li> Item received promptly.  It feels great on my face and I think I see improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> It felt so good and soothing</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Wow amazing product and it really does the great job</li>
    <li> This mask is great. It leaves my skin smooth, hydrated,  and it makes the fine lines less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Great for a day of pampering at home. Definitely, more affordable than the spa. They are easy to use. Just warm them apply, let sit, peel off. They fit on the face well. They left my face feeling so soft! They are individually packed so they are great for traveling! Wonderful after a long flight! I love these spa like masks! I am happy to recieve these to review. Very nice quality!</li>
    <li> Great quality, make my skin feel so comfortable after use.</li>
