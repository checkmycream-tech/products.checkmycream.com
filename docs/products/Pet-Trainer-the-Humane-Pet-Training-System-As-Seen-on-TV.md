      <li>Now he&#x27;s more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you!!!</li>
      <li>This product is a great help in training a cat or dog.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re are so happy that we tried the Pet Trainer.</li>
      <li>Happy, happy.</li>
      <li>It works great on some of my dogs.</li>
      <li>While it says it will work for cats, good luck.</li>
      <li>Works fairly well with my noisy Jac Russell.</li>
      <li>I loved, loved, loved this device.</li>
      <li>received in time stated very satisfied with purchase.</li>
      <li>My dog hates it which means I love it!</li>
      <li>The pet trainer is effective.</li>
      <li>Love it,</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t deter their adventurous behavior.</li>
      <li>But not all.over all I&#x27;m pleased</li>
      <li>I love this thing.</li>
      <li>I have 3 chihuhuas, they love to bark.</li>
      <li>I got it when I had my Grand dogs over.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use and we felt</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s easily portable and can be taken  on walks and almost everywhere just in case</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>+ dbs of sound.  </li>
      <li>I just hope that the company (employer) should remind their employees how to really communicate with their clients!!!</li>
      <li>This pet training device was successfully used 2x with my dog, then after that he just barked in the direction of the silent buzz.    </li>
      <li>Also, I try to point it away from the dog and make sure I am a decent distance from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I press the button and get a quick response from my dogs.</li>
      <li>The item worked the first time but when my dog realized what I was doing with it, she just ignored the sound.</li>
      <li>He pulled out a decibel meter and discovered that with a fresh battery this thing puts out 100</li>
      <li>well worth the money</li>
      <li>she keeps right on going.</li>
      <li>but this in no way works on her if you put it right up to her ear</li>
      <li>It emits a high pitched sound that you can hear</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it was friendly to use as they heard the high pitch</li>
      <li>Taffy, if loose on her own, won&#x27;t come home until she feels like it.  </li>
      <li>You do have to be consistent, though.  </li>
      <li>It actually works better if she sees me reaching for it</li>
      <li>I used it on him for the first time</li>
      <li>My dogs want to go outside at night, but in warmer weather, they enjoy sniffing around and don&#x27;t want to come in right away.</li>
      <li>At first my dog really responded to it but then learned to \\&quot;tune it out\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I know he is getting the signal, but it can&#x27;t be strong enough, because he does not stop barking.</li>
      <li>My dog is very high strung and barks when the garbage is picked up, the door opens, the door closes, the sun comes up, etc.</li>
      <li>I am very disapointed she is a smart dog house broke in a week.</li>
      <li>I have 2 family members that it worked wonders for thier dogs but didn&#x27;t do much for mine.</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping that I could get them to stop barking so much.    </li>
      <li>After repeating this drama several more times, he simply stopped barking at me.  </li>
      <li>We were amazed at how quickly he learned that barking means blue box pain.  </li>
      <li>My husband just picked up the blue box and he quickly ran away.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this device.</li>
      <li>Had high hopes for this.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other techniques and this is the only one that has worked consistently to the point that I walk in the room with my hand in my pocket and the dog quits barking whether I have the device or not.</li>
      <li>Our sheltie &amp; the other 2 dogs just look around to see where the sound is coming from &amp; continue to bark.</li>
      <li>Put a new battery in it, pressed the button, and nothing happened.  </li>
      <li>MY DOG IS OVERALL SMART AND BEHAVES WELL.....</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s louder than shouting but because the frequency is so high, humans barely hear it.</li>
      <li>Clearly ineffective.</li>
      <li>It almost seemed like the dogs were more afraid of the thing than the sound it made.</li>
      <li>A three year old barking Pomeranian mix that my friend adopted barks incessantly at me and anyone else who happens by the house.</li>
      <li>both our dogs are sensitive to sounds, so it works on both of them,  </li>
      <li>&amp; she&#x27;s the only one that really didn&#x27;t need it, of the 4</li>
      <li>As far as making them stop barking it makes all the dogs around my house howl.</li>
      <li>Very humane training tool that actually works.</li>
      <li>I will looking for another product that has different levels of the signal so you can go low to high.</li>
      <li>I chose only this behavior to train them with it because I thought they would be confused if we used it for more than one command.  </li>

<li> When he returned a few minutes later he just sat on the rug next to us QUIET!  </li>
<li> Now that I&#x27;ve used it for so long, she has started to stop doing what she is doing when she sees me pick it</li>
<li> I tried other batteries with the same results.  </li>
<li> This is the only thing I use to train my dog (other than a treat here and there).</li>
<li> We got a year old small sheltie about a month ago.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve taken with me on walks to discourage stray dogs and even zapped aggressive barking dogs to get them to back down.  </li>
<li> Does not work on black and white dogs..</li>
<li> At two in the morning, I don&#x27;t want to be calling for my dogs and wake the neighbors, so this little device lets me call for the dogs to come back in without any noise to my sleeping neighbors!</li>
<li> But then she comes out with this little blue box</li>
<li> I ordered this because my 3 yr old male yorkie was a rescue, and I realized within a month of having him he was not good with other dogs.</li>
<li> I would have sent it back, but I just didn&#x27;t want to waste the time it would take to repackage it for return.</li>
<li> I think it has worked as the cat seldom tries to bite now.</li>
<li> I point it at My Toy Australian Shepherd, so he is a very small dog, and when I point it at him I can see his ears go back, so</li>
<li> , the other two will trample him if he gets close, the owner of the dog doesnt think so, O know my horses.</li>
<li> We bought the pet trainer hoping to train our sheltie not to bark at everything &amp; the other 2 not to bark at the door.</li>
<li> DOWN</li>
<li> Do not hold it down.</li>
<li> This product is a total waste of money!!</li>
<li> I must be half dog.</li>
<li> Mine couldn&#x27;t care less.</li>
<li> His nervers where so wired tight.</li>
<li> My shih-tzu listens to it and my pit is a little scared of it.</li>
<li> I was sceptical, but this little device makes an impact on our pets.  </li>
<li> If the oppurtunity arises, they will.&lt;br /&gt;The little dog upset my tennessee walker</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> we spoke firmly and pressed the button.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
<li> /&gt;This is a waste of your money.</li>
<li> rely heavily on my &amp;#34;blue button.&amp;#34;</li>
<li> This was a waste of money.</li>
<li> This was a waste of my hard earned money.     http://www.amazon.com/Pet-Zoom-Sonic-Trainer/dp/B003EYUDT2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;pet-supplies&amp;qid&#x3D;1277404637&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2</li>
<li> might work for a small dog but not a lab.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s helping deter a small dig that yelps all the time and upsetting my horses.</li>
<li> (I usually carry it in my pocket around the house.)</li>
<li> Just sorry the quiet dog has had to listen to it</li>
<li> No more barking.  </li>
<li> But they can&#x27;t usually hear it when they are going away from you.</li>
<li> Sorry, it does not seem to work on larger dogs</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this because my 3 yr old male yorkie was a rescue, and I realized within a month of having him he was not good with other dogs. When we go on a walk if he sees another dog he lunges and nonstop barks. My friend recommended me this product but it had zero effect what so ever on him. His ears dont perk up and he still continues barking. Save your money</li>
    <li> If you think this is going to fix your dogs crappy attitude, think again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just makes the dog want to bite you, and bark at you more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just give your dog away. You can&#x27;t train a dog.</li>
    <li> I use the pet trainer to stop my tea-cup terrier from parking. She doesn&#x27;t stop immediately when I use it but eventually she does stop. The pet trainer is effective.</li>
    <li> This pet training device was successfully used 2x with my dog, then after that he just barked in the direction of the silent buzz.    This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> MY DOG IS OVERALL SMART AND BEHAVES WELL.....BUT I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING HER TO STOP JUMPING ON PEOPLE (PART LAB-SHARPI) AFTER ONLY A COUPLE TIMES USEING THE PET TRAINNER SHE HAS ALL BUT STOPPED. NEXT I WILL TRY IT ON HER RUNNING AFTER THE DEER THAT COME IN THE YARD.....BY THE WAY...IT DOESN&#x27;T APPEAR TO HARM HER..THINK IT USES A HI PITCH NOISE THAT ANIMALS DON&#x27;T LIKE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this product!!! We got a year old small sheltie about a month ago. She hadn&#x27;t had any training &amp; when we have her outside, she barks at everything that moves. Plus we have been dog sitting for a family member&#x27;s 3 dogs that are well trained except when anyone comes to the door, then 2 of the 3 dogs bark up a storm. We bought the pet trainer hoping to train our sheltie not to bark at everything &amp; the other 2 not to bark at the door. It hasn&#x27;t helped our barking problems at all!!! Only one of the 3 dogs we are dog sitting obviously doesn&#x27;t like it, she runs &amp; hides when we use it &amp; she&#x27;s the only one that really didn&#x27;t need it, of the 4 she&#x27;s the only one that seldom barks at anything. Our sheltie &amp; the other 2 dogs just look around to see where the sound is coming from &amp; continue to bark. This product is a total waste of money!! Don&#x27;t even bother!!</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this. I have a 3lb yorkie pup. It gets her to flip her ears but that&#x27;s about it. I have 2 family members that it worked wonders for thier dogs but didn&#x27;t do much for mine.</li>
    <li> At first my dog really responded to it but then learned to \\&quot;tune it out\\&quot;.  It actually works better if she sees me reaching for it but if she is too focused on the barking, she does not respond to it.</li>
    <li> I ordered Pet trainer TM (trademark) for $17.95 and As-Seen-on-TV-products sent me PET ZOOM TM (although both of them are under same manufacturer: EMSON but different in prices!). I called the customer service to discuss and find out about this things... The representative informed me that they are just the same (prices are different and I was charged for the highest price), but the way she communicated was rude... terrible! I just hope that the company (employer) should remind their employees how to really communicate with their clients!!!</li>
    <li> I have not used it alot.  I think it has worked as the cat seldom tries to bite now.</li>
    <li> I do hear it and it&#x27;s driving me nuts. My ear drums start to vibrate and I get nauseated every time I use it... I must be half dog.</li>
    <li> Learned about this product from my grandmother -- was so impressed bought one.  Now all I have to do is mention the \\&quot;blue box\\&quot; and the dog shapes up .....  This is the Emson brand only - not all the others.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical, but this little device makes an impact on our pets.  When you press the button, the cat runs for cover and the dogs perk up their ears and stop whatever annoying thing they were doing. My son discovered why.  He pulled out a decibel meter and discovered that with a fresh battery this thing puts out 100+ dbs of sound.  That&#x27;s louder than shouting but because the frequency is so high, humans barely hear it. It&#x27;s like shouting quietly at your pet.</li>
    <li> This product is a great help in training a cat or dog. But they can&#x27;t usually hear it when they are going away from you.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a recommendation from a relative. It is a bogus item. I point it at My Toy Australian Shepherd, so he is a very small dog, and when I point it at him I can see his ears go back, so I know he is getting the signal, but it can&#x27;t be strong enough, because he does not stop barking. I would not recommend this to anyone. I will looking for another product that has different levels of the signal so you can go low to high. He has learned to tune it out. This was a waste of my hard earned money.     http://www.amazon.com/Pet-Zoom-Sonic-Trainer/dp/B003EYUDT2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;pet-supplies&amp;qid&#x3D;1277404637&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2</li>
    <li> I got this for my dog it does nothing  she keeps right on going. As far as making them stop barking it makes all the dogs around my house howl.I am very disapointed she is a smart dog house broke in a week. but this in no way works on her if you put it right up to her ear she will move her head away from it and that is all.it might work for a small dog but not a lab.</li>
    <li> It works great on some of my dogs. But not all.over all I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> Our dog would bark when someone came to the door.  That&#x27;s fine.  However, she would NOT stop barking!  After using the Pet Trainer a couple of times, she now barks only once to alert us and then is quiet!  A miracle!  We&#x27;re are so happy that we tried the Pet Trainer.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried the shock collar, rewards, punishments, etc....we&#x27;ve tried it all.  Nothing worked on my beagle mix.  One click from the \\&quot;Blue Box\\&quot; and she returns to my side and/or stops whatever bad behavior she was doing.  Note: some dogs do not react to it...both our dogs are sensitive to sounds, so it works on both of them,  Now we only have to show them the Blue Box &amp; they behave!</li>
    <li> A three year old barking Pomeranian mix that my friend adopted barks incessantly at me and anyone else who happens by the house. The noise is so unbearable, I wasn&#x27;t going to visit her anymore.  But then she comes out with this little blue box, the Pet Trainer her friend had given her,  and I point it at this barking devil from hell. He immediately stops barking and biting me and hides.  After repeating this drama several more times, he simply stopped barking at me.  We were amazed at how quickly he learned that barking means blue box pain.  I loved, loved, loved this device. I was tempted to torture him with it since he did bite me but I exercised control.  What a deal for 15 bucks. If you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s because your dog is hopelessly dumb and can&#x27;t make the connection.  I think it&#x27;s a miracle time saver and money saver.</li>
    <li> It works!  You do have to be consistent, though.  I got it when I had my Grand dogs over.  Taffy, if loose on her own, won&#x27;t come home until she feels like it.  I pointed it at her and told her to come, and she did.  Also, my dog barks whenever someone goes by.  I pointed at him with  the Pet Trainer, and he stopped.</li>
    <li> Have 2 yippy Yorkies that barks at anything that comes within 20 feet of the front door.  I bought this hoping that I could get them to stop barking so much.    It emits a high pitched sound that you can hear and I think it did effect the dogs.  But I found that you have to press the button before they start going crazy with their barking.  It almost seemed like the dogs were more afraid of the thing than the sound it made.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 months ago, never heard a word, I had to go through Amazon with my question about where it is.. i received an e-mail stating they were out of stock, and should be in shortly.. Still haven&#x27;t received it and who knows when i will. I would like to get my money back, should have bought it at Walgreens,I could have taken it home with me.. yes i am mad...</li>
    <li> Put a new battery in it, pressed the button, and nothing happened.  I tried other batteries with the same results.  It is manufactured so that you can&#x27;t open it up so there is no way to check for obvious problems. Garbage.</li>
    <li> I have 3 chihuhuas, they love to bark. I got this 3 days ago.  No more barking.  They stop immediately.  No cowering, no whining, just silence.  I would recommend this to anyone with a barking problem.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well with my noisy Jac Russell. Just sorry the quiet dog has had to listen to it</li>
    <li> My dog is very high strung and barks when the garbage is picked up, the door opens, the door closes, the sun comes up, etc. I have tried many other techniques and this is the only one that has worked consistently to the point that I walk in the room with my hand in my pocket and the dog quits barking whether I have the device or not. (I usually carry it in my pocket around the house.) While it says it will work for cats, good luck. Anyone who owns a cat knows that cats can stump us at every attempt to modify their behavior. I highly recommend this device.</li>
    <li> The item worked the first time but when my dog realized what I was doing with it, she just ignored the sound. It only took her one day to figure it out. Was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very humane training tool that actually works. I&#x27;ve taken with me on walks to discourage stray dogs and even zapped aggressive barking dogs to get them to back down.  Only thing is I can actually hear it as well.  Not bothersome, just noticeable for some folks.</li>
    <li> Helped me to stop my cat from waking me up at 4 am meowing and when he was getting up on the counter.  Now, when he sees the blue thing in my hand, he immediately gets off the counter. Worked for me.</li>
    <li> My dogs want to go outside at night, but in warmer weather, they enjoy sniffing around and don&#x27;t want to come in right away. At two in the morning, I don&#x27;t want to be calling for my dogs and wake the neighbors, so this little device lets me call for the dogs to come back in without any noise to my sleeping neighbors! I press the button and get a quick response from my dogs.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!  They see me reaching for it, stop in their tracks, and give me the &amp;#34;I&#x27;m sorry mom&amp;#34; look!</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problems I have had is one Corgi was so scared from the noise, I think she was traumatized and if the dog is deaf, it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lab mix was a puppy when I tried it on him. I don&#x27;t think he could hear it. I can use it on him now. My shih-tzu listens to it and my pit is a little scared of it. I used it on him for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rely heavily on my &amp;#34;blue button.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This might be the coolest invention ever! This is the only thing I use to train my dog (other than a treat here and there). I push the button when she is doing something that I don&#x27;t want her to be doing and she freezes and looks at me. Now that I&#x27;ve used it for so long, she has started to stop doing what she is doing when she sees me pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this... you only need to push the button and release it immediately. Do not hold it down. Also, I try to point it away from the dog and make sure I am a decent distance from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine not having this. It was a lifesaver for us because we have a newborn and our dog was a barker. No longer!!</li>
    <li> I tried it, didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> It works!  I have a chihuahua that would sit by the table when we ate and whine and jump up on my leg.  I used this trainer just once and he has stopped all wining and jumping up.  Today he approached us while we were having lunch and went to jump up on my leg.  My husband just picked up the blue box and he quickly ran away.  When he returned a few minutes later he just sat on the rug next to us QUIET!  We were amazed. Love it, well worth the money spent.&lt;br /&gt;Christina</li>

    <li> Sorry, it does not seem to work on larger dogs</li>
    <li> My aunt recommended this saying it worked wonders with her cat. Mine couldn&#x27;t care less. They hear it but it doesn&#x27;t deter their adventurous behavior.</li>
    <li> Worked.  We wanted to teach our dogs not too &#x27;jump up&#x27; for attention or petting.  They behave after using this.  I chose only this behavior to train them with it because I thought they would be confused if we used it for more than one command.  DOWN we spoke firmly and pressed the button.&lt;br /&gt;It worked like a charm.  They don&#x27;t jump up and we haven&#x27;t had to use the device for a month.  The training stuck.  It was easy to use and we felt&lt;br /&gt;it was friendly to use as they heard the high pitch but we didn&#x27;t and neither did any guests who came to visit.</li>
    <li> My dog hates it which means I love it! I bought it to correct barking and it works. I give him the command and if he doesn&#x27;t stop I use the tool.  I used it only a couple of times and he now stops on command. I like the fact that it&#x27;s easily portable and can be taken  on walks and almost everywhere just in case but I have not had to use it. It may not work for all dogs but it worked for mine. He&#x27;s a rescue and a small dog and had mulitiple issues that had never been corrected. It took time but we had worked out everything but the barking which I hated until I found this tool and now even that is corrected. Happy, happy.</li>
    <li> only worked some what</li>
    <li> We have 2 cats - a female cat who already listens to &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; and a male who ignores us. We got this for the stubborn male. The female ran away when we used this, the male walked up to it and started licking it. Clearly ineffective.</li>
    <li> This thing is junk. It just does not work the way they say it should. Waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Does not work on black and white dogs..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helping deter a small dig that yelps all the time and upsetting my horses. He does&#x27;t stick around a third of the time barking and snapping at us and at my horses, 2 of my horses ecnore home, the other two will trample him if he gets close, the owner of the dog doesnt think so, O know my horses. If the oppurtunity arises, they will.&lt;br /&gt;The little dog upset my tennessee walker so bad that he bit my husbund. His nervers where so wired tight. Now he&#x27;s more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you!!!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Not one iota. If my dog heard it, I couldn&#x27;t tell. I would have sent it back, but I just didn&#x27;t want to waste the time it would take to repackage it for return. Instead, I signed us (me and my dog) up for obedience school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a waste of your money.</li>
