      <li>Cannot say enough wonderful things about this product!!</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>Would suggest a better quality sprayer nozzle as this one beaks too easily and sprays product in clumps.</li>
      <li>Great for daily moisturizing and curl rejuvenation.</li>
      <li>I have tried other products, but this has worked the best by far.</li>
      <li>If your hair is extremely dry, this is really good</li>
      <li>Im not a big fan of putting products in my hair, but i love this!</li>

      <li>This product really helps with detangling and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Not a strong scent, it really just smells like product that can easily be covered</li>
      <li>My 4year old daughter has long curly hair and it tangles up quickly.</li>
      <li>Not very thick or runny either.</li>
      <li>So until that&#x27;s fixed, don&#x27;t buy the 32oz</li>
      <li>Oh and It was recommended to me by a professional stylist of African hair and hair care.</li>
      <li>I really like this and only gave it four stars, because it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my dry scalp.</li>
      <li>this the only productt I have found that does not dry out my natural 4c hair.</li>
      <li>It does not dry out her hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> LOVE IT makes my hair soft  and less frizzy</li>
    <li> My 4year old daughter has long curly hair and it tangles up quickly. The miracle worker detangles her hair and keeps her curls looking wet. It does not dry out her hair. I am ready to buy another bottle. At times I use it for myself, it detangles my curly hair and gives it a shiny look.</li>
    <li> Last time I bought the 32 oz but they sent me a 16 oz. It&#x27;s still a good product. So until that&#x27;s fixed, don&#x27;t buy the 32oz</li>
    <li> Great for daily moisturizing and curl rejuvenation.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous first using this product thinking it was going to make my thick hair greasy and stiff, it did not! It made my hair very bouncy and shiny. Im not a big fan of putting products in my hair, but i love this! It does justice on your hair. Not very thick or runny either. Its amazing.</li>
    <li> Just by a fluke I purchased this product to see if it would work on fine straight hair. The other stuff is just too oily. Just need a quarter size dollop and good to go.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I have type 4C natural, tightly coiled hair, once it becomes dry it&#x27;ll shrink several inches and become nearly impossible to manipulate.

    <li> Love this product! this the only productt I have found that does not dry out my natural 4c hair. I use product in my LOC method and I apply daily.</li>
    <li> When it arrived to me it somehow opened a some of the product leaked out unbelievable</li>
    <li> Great Product was leaking on arrival</li>
    <li> works great! I have tried other products, but this has worked the best by far.</li>
    <li> works great for my hair type</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter. We have used this for years. It makes her hair look great and its not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent Spray that I use along with leave in conditioner and curl activators. A little goes a long ways. I&#x27;ll have this for a while, cause I don&#x27;t have to use it daily. On days when I&#x27;m not going anywhere. I keep my hair tied down..</li>
    <li> My favorite hair moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve discovered a product that exceeds what I thought it would. I would recommend this to everyone of my family and friends.</li>
    <li> My secret weapon for smooth updos, and pony tails. Would suggest a better quality sprayer nozzle as this one beaks too easily and sprays product in clumps. May I suggest, spray in hand first then apply.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT moisturizer.  If your hair is extremely dry, this is really good</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found to use on my &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; children&#x27;s hair. Leaves the curls so beautiful!!! Dries with no residue!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this and only gave it four stars, because it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my dry scalp. Other than that, 0 complaints. Moisturizes my hair, isn&#x27;t greasy or tacky, nor does it leave flakes. Not a strong scent, it really just smells like product that can easily be covered (I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter black vanilla oil spray or Mango Lime oil). Enhances my curls for a beautiful twist/braid out and defines them enough to last for days.</li>
    <li> As a Black woman with natural hair, I have been on the hunt for something like this. This is the best product I&#x27;e found for my natural hair. It nourishes my curls so well! It also helps it to lay right, so that I don&#x27;t have frizzy pieces here and there. Cannot say enough wonderful things about this product!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer! Not greasy like other products and keeps my hair soft.</li>
