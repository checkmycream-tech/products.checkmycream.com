<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful product. I used them for contouring and blush and them are great!</li>
    <li> I received the brushes before the expected date, which was great. I like how they feel &amp; apply foundation. I&#x27;ve only used one of the four brushes so far, &amp; the thing I hated was after about three washes it started shedding a little &amp; then after the next wash, the brush was destroyed because the glue that held the brush together came loose &amp; the bristles detached from the handle.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.. is perfect for me, I was looking something useful with good quality and a good price! So far very happy</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are very soft and I love that about them. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the brushes didn&#x27;t say what to use them for.</li>
    <li> Bushes came broken, were not good quality</li>
    <li> It only came with one brush? Bulls*** if I was gonna pay $10 for a brush I might as well pay the extra for the real thing.</li>
    <li> Really Good brushes , arrived before estimated time .</li>
    <li> All I can say is if your looking for a good quality kabuki brush set this is it. If I didnt know better I would think it was a high end set. Ordering a few more for gifts.</li>
    <li> These are close to amazing. 1st off they came within 4 days of ordering them which was really nice due to the fact it estimated a month. 2nd the brushes are really soft and leave a nice air brushed finish(something all makeup geeks look for) . The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the smell out of the package but I&#x27;m sure one wash will take care of that problem. The other thing I didn&#x27;t like was one of the brushes made a crunchy noise when applying eye concealer. I hope this helped you make your decision . At the end of the day I would order these again.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price. Very dense and soft.</li>
    <li> these brushes are absolutely amazing, way better than I expected. they came two weeks early and are definitely comparable to some high end brushes. and they are so beautiful! used them for my make up today and was very impressed!</li>
    <li> Oh my.. these are absolutely great brushes! They are a bit stiff but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because they are so new. Over all they are awesome!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!! Super soft and gives my face a flawless finish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bushes did have a little weird smell when I got them but after a wash it went away.</li>
    <li> Very nice soft brushes. Easy to use and distributes the makeup evenly on your face. Great price too.</li>
    <li> These came in way too early and I love it!! At first, it does have a slightly factory like odor but after washing them with baby shampoo, the smell disappeared.</li>
    <li> love love love these brushes. I will forever use brushes to apply my liquid foundation instead of a sponge. These were pretty great quality for how cheap they were.</li>
    <li> smelt weird out of package but works amazing lol</li>
    <li> I love them! They make my fave look amazing</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic for the price. My favorite over my others. I use them everyday!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I was surprised how well these performed. For the price, I wasn&#x27;t sure. They do shed a couple of hairs at times.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter who LOVES doing makeup! They are great and super soft</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price</li>
    <li> I just tried out these brushes and I was very impressed with how well applied the makeup looked after using them. I&#x27;ve never tried this brand before but since it had such good reviews I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes did have a strong plastic smell when they arrived but I let them air out over night and they were fine the next morning. The bristles are very soft.</li>
    <li> These brushes r excellent, the shipping was fast and packaging wasn&#x27;t bad either, these brushes was price very well and the quality is excellent better then my Mac brushes which cost me a tone!</li>
    <li> I just got this brushes in the mail . I am totally inlove with them . They are soft and good quality . The only bad thing is that they smell like paint but it comes off once you wash it .</li>
    <li> Inlove with them they are soo soft and are of good quality..</li>
    <li> Very weird shapes, I only use one of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was wanting! Works great!</li>
    <li> I ordered these on January 29th and they were supposed to be delivered between February 25th and March 13th. They came on February 13th and they are honestly very soft!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!the quality of these exceeded my expectations. The bristles are made of the softest goat hair, the bristles are packed well and don&#x27;t shed. The brushes did take some time to get to me,but this was expected. Also, I would easily compare these brushes with $20-40 ones. I&#x27;ve already told a few friends about it and they&#x27;ve bought them and are pleased as well.</li>
    <li> First time I used the white tip brush it bent at the base of the gold.  I straightened it and pushed together but I don&#x27;t know long it will last before it comes apart.  Crappy workmanship.  I was applying liquid makeup to my face--not digging a hole in the yard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is a few months later and the white tipped pointed brush is losing hairs all over my face and half of the thing has come out of the ferule, the metal part. The brush for powder is okay but the foundation brush will have to be replaced by another brand!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!</li>
    <li> There nice and everything my biggest problem is its there really big hard to use for contouring brushes</li>
    <li> Brushes are great! I&#x27;ve been using them for a few weeks now; and cleaned them once, all brushes cleaned up excellently, and no loose bristles.  So far, so good; I love how they apply my makeup.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Soft and good quality.</li>
    <li> Great quality! Would totally recommend over and over. I was REALLY SHOCKED at the quality and how soft and fancy the brushes feel. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping I love the brushes❤️</li>
    <li> Got them much sooner than expected and I love them! There is a slight smell to them, but after you wash them once it should go away. So happy with the quality of these brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> love my brushes, they came faster then I thought they would.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Its been almost a year and some minor shedding started to occur.</li>
    <li> absolutely amazing quality brushes. Super soft bristles! i would purchase these over sigma over and over again!</li>
    <li> I use three out of the four brushes and they are very soft and sustainable, however the tops have fallen of the handle, not that I care they still work great for me.</li>
    <li> One of the best make up brushes that are inexpensive. If you&#x27;re starting as a new make up artist these are great.</li>
    <li> Great value. Brushes are high quality and don&#x27;t shead.</li>
    <li> Great brushes love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this set 5 stars only for the flat top Kabuki brush. The other 3 brushes are crap, but for 8 bucks just order this set and throw them out! I use the flat top every day. It picks up the perfect amount of foundation and blends it into the skin lovely. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> okay so I received my brush earlier than expected i was sooo happy , they were packed neatly and a little make up pad came with it . The brushes are soft probably alittle bit to soft but they are still good if you have a sensitive face , they also look alike to me for some reason they all look like blush brushes but i will be using them&lt;br /&gt;For more then a blush brush , im happy with them in all</li>
    <li> Great price. Great quality.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE BRUSHES! They came packaged really nicely, and they&#x27;re super soft. No shedding, even after first wash. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Every single brush I have falling apart, I will have to buy some glue and glue them back together other than the brush falling apart they work pretty well purchase at your own risk</li>
    <li> Despite the smell in the beginning if you air out the brushes the smell goes away. For the price cant beat it.....Does a lovely job!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. They are soft, sturdy, and compare with my higher end brushes as far as performance. I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these brushes.  So gentle on your skin.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Did have a paint brush smell, but does wear off and did have a good amount of denseness and softness to bristles, compared to high end brushes i buy</li>
    <li> The brushes are good enough, I like them more for Powders, well made Brushes for the Price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used two of these brushes so far, but both are absolutely wonderful.  So much better than paying $25 dollars for just one brush, when these are exactly the same quality.</li>
    <li> Money well spent! This brushes are wonderful and easy to clean. Nice thick and soft!</li>
    <li> Affordable! Great quality! All brushes have fall out, and I&#x27;ve only had a strand or two come off several times after washing. Comparable to the Sigma brushes! It is starting to break off when I wash it, but nothing a little glue can&#x27;t fix! Takes awhile to ship, but hey...it&#x27;s worth the wait</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. They are soft and spread products really nice. I had to glue one of them back to its handle because for some reason it wasn&#x27;t glued. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes smell very strong of spray paint. It makes me sick to my stomach. I really wanted to like these brushes, I bought two packs after reading the fantastic review. Even after a week of letting them air out they still smell as strong as the day I got them, very toxic. Also I haven&#x27;t used it at all and they are shedding hairs. Biggest waiste of $16.</li>
    <li> They are amazing and so soft . They apply to foundation and powders perfectly to your face . I&#x27;m in love !!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! very soft &amp; they were also delivered very fast :)</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect love it</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast they came early :) and extremely soft can&#x27;t wait to use them!!!!</li>
    <li> Have to crazy glue  the brushes came off either than that good quality</li>
    <li> I boughts these brushes a while back they were good for the price paid but one of them broke off so easily. Its okay if you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes! Especially the foundation brush!! I would definitely purchase again and again. :)</li>
    <li> You can check my review of these out on my Instagram @codywren These are amazing quality and in my opinion are better than the Sigma set. They don&#x27;t shed or suck up the product like my Sigma ones do. I would 100% recommend these brushes to anyone. They came shipped nicely and were packaged perfectly!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. I received 7 instead of 4. Very happy with the quality. They are so soft. There was a slight odor of paint but after a few washes it came out</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They are so amazing and the price is a plus. I&#x27;ve ordered two sets of these they are that good!!!</li>
    <li> love these !!!  fast shipping !!!  thank you</li>
    <li> I received my order really fast! These brushes are very high quality and very soft. I&#x27;m starting to do freelance makeup and these are just wonderful! I have no complains :)</li>
    <li> Work great, can&#x27;t believe how well they work for the price!!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes, happy to have so many of them and the quality has held up thus far.  4 months in.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes fell apart as soon as I pulled them out the package and some fall outs</li>
    <li> The best brush feel expensive but its super cheap</li>
    <li> These are really nice and durable a must have!!!!</li>
    <li> Very soft and worked great! No bristles fell out and they didn&#x27;t smell funny like some reviews said.. Would recommend! Love them!</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price....very soft and so far no shedding.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They help me to better apply my foundation, concealer, blush, and matting (finishing powder! I would recommend them to anyone who likes a flawless face and perfect foundation coverage and setting!</li>
    <li> I bought these after I got tired of finding stray brush hairs all over my face with my old brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fairly inexpensive and they&#x27;re definitely sturdy. I&#x27;ve yet to find any stray hairs. The handles are a perfect size. The metal portion isn&#x27;t cheaply made like I feared it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are inexpensive but don&#x27;t look it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have had them for one year. 2 of the bristle/metal pieces have fallen off the stick. Otherwise, still usable.</li>
    <li> WOW, This set is amazing. One of the wooden handles fell out but its more than worth it I will add a bit of glue because these brushes are the most luxurious brushes I have had since sigma. Love them.</li>
    <li> very soft bristles, better than some of my regular brushes</li>
    <li> I love how pefect they came. Everything was perfect!!  These brushes are so perfect they give you an even spread for your foundation. The tapered kabuki brush is good for spreading your concealer and setting it with a powder. The round kabuki and the flat kabuki brush are both pefect for putting on your foundation. And the angled kabuki is best for contouring your cheekbones to give you that hollowed look. Overall these brushes are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had!!! Thanks for creating this product!!!</li>
    <li> Good brushes but they stunk and one broke the first time I used it .</li>
    <li> Not happy at all, the brushes came off of the handle almost immediately after opening the package. Very cheaply made, and cheap quality fibers, shed really bad. Hence the price. Not worth it. Save your money and get something decent.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! No shedding and unbeliably soft!! Definitely a Must have!</li>
    <li> I received my order sooner than expected but I was actually expecting better quality brushes- based on the comments I&#x27;ve read. The brushes are cheaply made and I understand that much since its so cheap, however, they have a strong smell to them. I ignored the smell, and went to apply my foundation with the flat top, the fibers fall off as you move it. It was stuck under my foundation and I constantly had to go back and remove the fibers. Honestly, if you&#x27;re looking for a flawless foundation routine, invest in a beauty blender. It works amazing, and leaves no sign of make up!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes, very soft &amp; received them earlier than expected thank you</li>
    <li> These are the cheapest brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought but there also the best</li>
    <li> Loving these brushes so far they are so soft and beautiful and for the price amazing ! Definitely recommend these babies .</li>
    <li> Really great quality.  They were really soft too :)</li>
    <li> I have only used 2 of the 4 brushes in this set so far, and that&#x27;s only because I already have so many brushes in my collection, but I will leave a review on the 2 that I have used these past couple of weeks--the dome-shaped blending brush and angled blending brush.  I LOVE them both!  The brushes are densely packed, and the bristles are amazingly soft.  I use the angled brush to apply my foundation all over my face, and it blends my liquid foundation so easily, leaving full coverage all over my face.  I used to use the Bare Escentuals flat kabuki brush to apply my foundation, but because it is not synthetic, I was constantly picking off strands of bristles off my face, it was incredibly annoying!  It was one of my first brushes when I started getting into makeup that I used it regularly, but I&#x27;ve switched to synthetic brushes all the way!  The dome-shaped blending brush sets powder onto my undereye area perfectly! It does feel more densely packed than an actual setting brush, but if you use a light hand to set your makeup, it does what it is supposed to do, not leaving any caky powder residue.  These Leegoal brushes are amazing, and you cannot beat the price!  There is no cheap-smelling glue when you first open the package, either, in case anyone is wondering, and the best part--the brushes are individually wrapped, so I stored the other 2 brushes that I don&#x27;t use for a rainy day.  I most definitely recommend this set to anyone who is into makeup and wants really soft functional brushes for a flawless finish every time!</li>
    <li> Good quality item, reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I love all of these brushes. Each one is useful, of great quality especially for what I pad for them. They&#x27;re incredibly soft, there hasn&#x27;t been any shedding. A couple of the hairs were a little longer but that wasn&#x27;t an issue at all. Also, the handle doesn&#x27;t wiggle as if it&#x27;s going to fall off like has happened with some other cheap brushes that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes with super quick delivery, thanks to Amazon Prime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really suspicious of these brushes because of the really low price. My make-up expert friends always warned me that a good, expensive brush can be the difference between beauty and disaster. These brushes are super soft, thick and not a single strand fell out or was out of place. They have a decent weight to them, too. If you&#x27;re in the market for professional brushes but don&#x27;t want to spend professional money, look no further!</li>
    <li> Overall I luv the brushes so worth the $ however the foundation brush has been compared to the sigma F80 &amp; I don&#x27;t agree sigmas brush is much more dense &amp; softer on the face the briselles on this brush are not as great</li>
    <li> Brushesss are so soft!!! love them!!</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes! Love it!</li>
    <li> It really makes a difference when you use good quality brushes. These are good quality brushes and I can feel it when I use them to apply makeup to my face. There are excellent.</li>
    <li> In love with my new brushes ,great quality.</li>
    <li> I was a tad bit sceptical to buying these brushes because they are so cheap but I read all the reviews and most are very positive:) I ordered these on September 17 and got them September 27th and the arrival was October 25th I washed them and decided to give them a try today BEST brushes I&#x27;ve ever used no shedding all in tacked I would recommend these to anyone that needs good back up brushes or a mua starting a kit they are beyond amazing! Order them ASAP! I plan on ordering more for backups I love them so much!</li>
    <li> I bought theses brushes for my mom and she loved them, I will buy these brushes again. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This are amazing brushes. Regardless of how inexpensive they are. There not no sigma but they are great!!</li>
    <li> Good brushes but sadly one had glue all over the bristles and NOTHING gets it out.</li>
    <li> I love them .. Use them everyday. ThY are well made and the price is amazing. Highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! They are what i expected and came in really fast!!</li>
    <li> Completely happy with this product, the brushes work great and They came in with no problems!</li>
    <li> Very good dupe for some of the more expensive  brush sets. Strong paint scent on arrival but after a wash the scent vanished.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality brushes! So soft, doesn&#x27;t fall apart with proper washing. Recommend. Applies your makeup beautifully.</li>
    <li> Great buy for price . Soft brushes</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes!  Would highly recommend these! Perform just as well if not better than the higher end brushes!</li>
    <li> Great quality! Very stunned at how soft they are! Definitely worth it! Took a little longer than usual but obviously because they are shipped from China!</li>
    <li> The brushes came on time with really nice packaging but when i opened each individual brush they smelled disgusting. Like they smell so nasty. I thought it was just me but even my sister smelled it and said the same thing.</li>
    <li> A month of using, and already breaking.. :( I loved them until I had to start supergluing them back together after a month of use.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat these brushes for the price!! I wouldn&#x27;t say they are as great of quality as my Sigma brushes but they are very comparable!! The synthetic bristles are sooo soft, the shapes and sizes are perfect and they came packaged very nicely, they were in an envelope but wrapped very nicely inside, two of my brushes had small dents in the gold metal and that is the reason why I only gave them 4 stars, but like I said, you won&#x27;t find brushes of this great quality for this price anywhere else!! I definitely won&#x27;t stop purchasing Sigma by any means, but I highly suggest anyone who is paying a higher price for their brushes check these out, they are a great addition to any collection at a fantastic price! You won&#x27;t be disappointed you purchased these!</li>
    <li> Went you do you&#x27;re make up hairs start following. No Good</li>
    <li> Great brushes and I use them everyday! They are incredibly soft and not harsh at all like some brushes are. I would totally buy them again. They came on time and I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes simply amazing</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them! They are so soft and work very well. Comparable to some of the high end brushes out there</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Great price!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet but so far I am very impressed with the seller . The estimated shipping said at earliest they would be here the 20th of November, it&#x27;s the 7th and they&#x27;re here. I&#x27;m impressed. Upon opening the brushes, my first impression was wow. They look very sleek and stylish. The bristles are tightly packed and are incredibly soft . Can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
    <li> i like this so much and shipped fast</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. Very thick great for the money. I&#x27;m going to order another set very soon!!</li>
    <li> really soft and pretty thank you!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great and deffinitly worth the price. It can be used for many different things foundation, concealer blush blending and the are very similar to my sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I am beyond impressed! I wasn&#x27;t expecting these in the mail till at least Feb. 9. I got them two weeks earlier than the estimated delivery. They each came individually wrapped, then put in a bag, and then into a padded envelope. There was a faint smell that I noticed when unwrapping them, but it wasn&#x27;t the hairs, it was the black paint that they put on the handle. Smell was gone almost immediately. Brushes are beyond soft, and look exactly as pictured! They shed a little bit, but all new brushes shed. They don&#x27;t shed anymore than the sigma or mac brushes do. I took a bit of a gamble on these brushes, but I can say, without a doubt these brushes are just as good, if not better than mac and sigma. Seriously, my best buy on amazon to date!!! Oh, and my makeup has never looked better.</li>
    <li> It smells like paint but the texture is nice on the face</li>
    <li> Love the brushes and the quality</li>
    <li> very usuable and worth the cash ! good for starters.. really big though.</li>
    <li> Ordered these and they came pretty quick.Im so excited that my package came with 2 extra brushes. Nice quality but they do have a scent, which is ok because I&#x27;ve received brushes from a popular American site that smelled the same before I washed them. They are super soft. I didn&#x27;t used them yet so I couldn&#x27;t tell you how well it applies your makeup. So far I love them.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they are so incredibly SOFT &amp; provide a great application of any type of makeup. They do come with an insane plastic/acrylic smell though. I had to wash them in a little bit of soft soap &amp; warm water prior to my first use. I have very sensitive skin &amp; thought it might cause me to react, but they&#x27;re great after the first wash. Very minimal shedding, I&#x27;ve had these over a year I believe &amp; they&#x27;re still as full as can be. &amp; still so baby soft against my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! One of the best quality brushes I have purchased and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Omg these brush are amazing, first let say they are superrrrrr Soft! and very dense... Great price it beats buying the pricey ones, The shipping was great it took a week &amp; 4 days to arrive which wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so durable!  No bristles falling out at all. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> so soft! exellent for the price. doesnt shed</li>
    <li> These brushes are extremely soft. I use them for my mineral foundation. I like them better than my Bare Minerals brushes.</li>
    <li> They are super good brushes but if you are using them for foundation I would recommend a beauty blender. But if you like to apply it with brushes then these also do the job!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. My favorite is the flat top kabuki, I use it for my foundation and I love how it is so soft on my face, doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks/lines, and it does a wonderful job with blending and buffing. Very cheap and affordable with excellent quality!</li>
    <li> They are amazing by far . Gives flawless complexion.!!!</li>
    <li> They arrived early and are pretty good for cheaper brushes.  They smelled like paint but so does everything i order like that.</li>
    <li> Everything works. So far no problems. Wife likes it.</li>
    <li> Okay, so if you&#x27;re a broke college student such as myself and were super excited about the great price for FOUR brushes (a variety, at that!) then please keep reading before making a decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always read most recent one/two star reviews first before wasting time hyping myself up about a product; but with makeup tools people tend to be picky and compare it to better quality brushes/tools that have worked in the past. This time I made the mistake of getting sucked into the good. 4/5 star reviews because of the price. I mean, I was only looking for ONE foundation brush to replace a broken one so I was kind of excited about buying more than one brush at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely hate the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; excuse. I agree with the statement, but I also think sellers have an obligation to let customers know if there is a *specific* cheap-o quality to their product or a *specific* issue that other customers complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the point, I literally would have gotten the SAME deal if I had bought ONE foundation brush of equal value to these because that&#x27;s what I got. Out of the FOUR brushes, only ONE is not on the verge of breaking. Of course the first thing I do is wash them before using them. I frequently wash my brushes so I know a quality brush could withstand weekly washes.&lt;br /&gt;But with three of these I noticed immediately, as I washed the brush, that the gold piece attached to the black piece was loose and jiggling. That&#x27;s when the smoke came out of my ears because that&#x27;s exactly how the brush I was trying to REPLACE broke!!!! I didn&#x27;t get to use my brushes yet and they were already ready to be trashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash &amp;#34;dry makeup&amp;#34; brushes at least once a month, but I need to wash wet foundation make-up brushes once or twice a week. My E.L.F. brushes from Target, each $3 or less, have lasted for at least a year already and have been through many washes; it took one of those brushes over a year to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invest a little in a brush set or at least one or two &amp;#34;staple&amp;#34; brushes that will feel painful to pay for now, but will be totally worth it when you don&#x27;t have to search for a new brush every two weeks. :) I would return them in a flash if I could.break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invest a little in a brush set or at least one or two &amp;#34;staple&amp;#34; brushes that will feel painful to pay for now, but will be totally worth it when you don&#x27;t have to search for a new brush every two weeks. :) I would return them in a flash if I could.</li>
    <li> flat top kabuki brush is my new favorite brush. this set took awhile to get here but for the price it was worth it. the quality is outstanding. the brushes have a nice weight to them so they feel like professional brushes. I clean them daily and shampoo once every 2 weeks and they have held up great. no problems with shedding</li>
    <li> Just got them in the mail I hope their as good as they look!</li>
    <li> great quality just a little stiff</li>
    <li> I looove this brushes and I recommend them to ANYONE. Great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;  Isabel</li>
    <li> So i got these brushes today. And one of these just literally broke, handle came off, the moment i got it out of the plastic wrap. So there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are fantastic. They&#x27;re very soft and doesn&#x27;t shed. My makeup goes on nice and easy with these.</li>
    <li> these are really good brushes... I have experienced no shedding!</li>
