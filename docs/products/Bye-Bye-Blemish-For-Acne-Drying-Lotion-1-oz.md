      <li>I just dip the q-tip in there gavotte on 2 or 3 times a day and if you want to put a very light layer on your blemish before applying your makeup that&#x27;s also a good idea to get treatment during the day but as soon as you&#x27;re at home get any makeup off the blemish you&#x27;re trying to get rid of any mediately treated again</li>
      <li>the results are amazing.  </li>
      <li>Works best on ready to pop zits.</li>

      <li>A must for warm summer evenings while sleeping.</li>
      <li>It feels effective when I apply the solution.  </li>
      <li>It seems like I have to wait for the zits to come to a head before this can be effective.</li>

      <li>I will still keep on searching for more effective stuff though :)</li>

      <li>I love this stuff and will buy more.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!!  </li>
      <li>It does speed up the blemish, but it seems to be making the hyper-pigmentation more of an issue at the end of the healing process.</li>

      <li>Love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten to the end of the bottle I&#x27;ve had to shake to get more product out</li>
      <li>Need to work on better ways to package your items.</li>
      <li>so the area around the pimple would peel off but the pimple itself was more irritated then before.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super fast shipping and a great product, love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Works great but kinda stinky!</li>
    <li> It took some time but I&#x27;ll say I saw results in about 2 weeks it just leaves my skin a little dry but its a good product.</li>
    <li> Good solution for clearing up acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am impressed or not. It does speed up the blemish, but it seems to be making the hyper-pigmentation more of an issue at the end of the healing process.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  Definitely give it a try.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> my grand son loves this and it works  , same as the expensive brand from serious skin , this is a winner</li>
    <li> this is the fastestblemish zit zapper I have ever used and it really does work. Make sure to shake it up I just dip the q-tip in there gavotte on 2 or 3 times a day and if you want to put a very light layer on your blemish before applying your makeup that&#x27;s also a good idea to get treatment during the day but as soon as you&#x27;re at home get any makeup off the blemish you&#x27;re trying to get rid of any mediately treated again and I just like to see a nice pink blob of the product and it will dry and you&#x27;ll see a pink kinda crusty looking thing on your pimple. And remember do not pick or gig at your face you don&#x27;t want to get scars. I just had a hormonal break out and I was trying to find this product finally I looked on the internet it&#x27;s an really good thing to have in your emergency medicine cabinet for a blemish pimple zitI would not recommend this as an all over your face product I&#x27;m not a doctor but it is a Drying Lotion and I believe it&#x27;s just meant to treat an individual pimple. Good luck and really give it a try it&#x27;s worth every penny forget the Clearasil and the suppose it either stuff they sell at the drugstore your pimple will be gone in 24 hours no that&#x27;s not true with this product you will in fact get super fast results and if you don&#x27;t I would go to the doctor it could be a bacterial situation that need the doctors attention and believe me I&#x27;ve tried many products.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Got to be that I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the local stores, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like it. Doesn&#x27;t always work but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> This product is just as good as much-higher-priced products with the exact same ingredients.  It&#x27;s a fraction of the cost and zaps blemishes quickly.  Dab on before bed and the results are amazing.  I love this product and always keep it handy for those unexpected break-outs.</li>
    <li> Dries zits.  Not glamorous.  Campy packaging ...but it dries zits.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to them - shake the product before using it!! I have used this product for several years, and have tried it both ways.  The verdict - shake it!!!!  This product is also excellent for eczema, psorisis and other skin rashes.  I have gluten intolerance, eczema and occasionally psorisis rashes.  I put bye bye blemish on all of these skin rashes and it helps STOP the itching!!  I put it on day or night when my skin itches from any one of these conditions.  It immediately cools and stops the itching.  This is due mostly because of the sulfur in the medication.  So, throw out ur useless cortisone creams that don&#x27;t really work and start buying this.  Believe me, I have suffered for years from these conditions and NOTHING helps more as a topical treatment than this product!  I never let myself run out, ever.  Just shake it, dip a Qtip in the mixture and apply it to whatever itchy places you have, even when there is no lesion and the skin isn&#x27;t broken open, this product cools and calms the itchy area.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product sounds good but didn&#x27;t work.  All it did was left pink on my face.  Didn&#x27;t dry up like the avon clearsil does.</li>
    <li> the best overnight zit miracle for an out of control, painful zit.  The sulphur and camphor really knocks the swelling down.  I sometimes get deep hormonal cysts that stay below the surface and never come to a head.  If I coat this on overnight, by morning, the boil isn&#x27;t as painful and not nearly as red.  Works great on the small problems too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve repurchases this over and over again! This treats spot pimples so well. I prefer this over the Mario badescu one. It does have a sulfur-ey smell and rubs off a little but so do all the other products that are like this one.</li>
    <li> Used this years ago and I&#x27;m happy to find it again. Works best on ready to pop zits. Go to sleep and wake up with smaller or no zit.</li>
    <li> Thank you this a good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of success with this product.  I have adult acne and use this product for spot treatment of blemishes and actual zits and found it to work great.  No real odor.  I don&#x27;t think you would be able to use it when you leave the house though, unless of course you want to get some really odd looks from people.</li>
    <li> Works better than anything else for break-outs. Dries pimples out overnight.. The price is much better than others like it..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before when you could buy it in the store. I&#x27;m so glad I could find here! It has good ingredients (nothing too toxic that I can remember - I am checking ALL labels these days!) and dries up my really bad zits really fast. I don&#x27;t use it all the time, only when my zits are bad - it seems when I use it all the time my skin gets used to it... but that happens to me with all acne products.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the products that cost twice as much. My teenage son depends on this. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am not a victim of overspread acne but when I do get pimples, this stuff is really one of my favorite solutions to use. It is too bad that most places do not carry it in their stores anymore. I first found this stuff at a CVS pharmacy about 5 years ago and they quit selling it, so I had to start ordering it online. The only cons I have with this stuff is it is very sensitive to shelf life. If not used frequently, it will go bad over the course of time and you will probably end up buying another one before the bottle is empty because it loses its strength. The other con is even if you wanted to buy a bunch and store them for future use, you&#x27;re best to only buy two at a time because by the time you get to the third bottle (or more), the solution is much weaker than a brand new bottle purchased recently. Other than that, buy two of them, use it when you can and eventually, your blemishes will go away much faster than using Oxy 10 or some other cream.</li>
    <li> As you can see, I am almost finished using the product. I have had it for about a year now so that tiny bottle goes a long way. It really doesn&#x27;t help with cystic acne - those things are in a league of their own. If you have a regular pimple and use a little bit on it as soon as possible it will clear up in 1-2 days. As others have said, it does dry out your face. However, I would rather have a few spots of dry skin than huge ugly pimples. Not sure why it says not to shake. As I&#x27;ve gotten to the end of the bottle I&#x27;ve had to shake to get more product out and it seemed just as effective. I definitely recommend this product. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me but maybe I was using it wrong. I still didn&#x27;t like the smell. It&#x27;s very messy to handle and the pink dot you have at the end doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on for a long time to actually help ot work. It isn&#x27;t the best stuff out there.</li>
    <li> excellent and on time!!</li>
    <li> Works well after deep cleaning your face</li>
    <li> Bye Bye Blemish drying lotion is well worth the money. Just putting it on once a day helps to dry up blemishes quicker than any products I&#x27;ve ever tried. The products is easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> eh not so great after all.  Doesn&#x27;t really do much at all when it comes to speeding up healing time</li>
    <li> It is a really good product! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product can save you when you have an important thing on the next day and you are breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;It kills absolutely all acne you put it in, and it is barely noticeable on the next day. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on (when the need arose) for several years now and I used to swear by it, but this time something was definitely different.  For one thing, it was much more watery, with significantly less of the concentrate at the bottom, and for another, the color was a much streakier orangey hue than the pink it used to be. Don&#x27;t know if the manufacturer is trying to cut corners by offering up a sub-par, cheaper formula or if I just got a bad batch, but I was deeply disappointed.  The new product doesn&#x27;t really work, either, whereas before it was  effective almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;  Why mess with a dependably successful formula?  At the very least tell people what you&#x27;ve done; it just seems foolishly short-sighted to save money in the short-term by making an inferior product, when all it does is ensure you&#x27;re going to lose your customer base for the future.</li>
    <li> I always get huge red pimples on my face every time when my period starts. The problem is sometimes it bursts out and make a big hole on my face! It goes without saying, as a woman it&#x27;s the last thing you want to have on your face. But when I started to use this product I didn&#x27;t worry about that anymore. It soothes my pimple and helps not to explode. The only negative thing I want to say is it gives a little bit of a sore in your eyes when you apply near your eyes. I would recommend Bye Bye Blemish to all of my friends :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with Acne breakouts for a while now and I have bought hundred dollar products that haven&#x27;t done what this product has done overnight. It shrinks the size of any pimple/zit OVERNIGHT! I understand that everyone&#x27;s acne is different but this is defientley the best product I have used for acne! Definetley worth the try for the cheap price!</li>
    <li> I used this drying lotion after washing my face, and it burned initially.  But I could feel the pimples going down instantly.  The next morning my face was 10times better than the day before.  The acne was disappearing immediately.  I highly recommend, but as the bottle says \\&quot;Do Not Shake\\&quot;! I used a Q-tip to apply.  You want to make sure you get the pink from the bottom of the drying lotion.  Its clear on top then pink towards the bottom.  Wonderful stuff</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed... It did dry, however it dried the top layer of skin so the area around the pimple would peel off but the pimple itself was more irritated then before.</li>
    <li> This is a good one, I actually need to purchase some more. I only have a little bit left. I&#x27;ve been using it approx a year now it works grreat.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the Mario Badescu drying lotion for a while now and when I heard bye bye blemish was a dupe, I decided to try it out. This works just as good if not better. It dries up the zit quickly BUT, my only complaint is that it can be a little too harsh so you have to be careful. I was able to use the Mario Badescu one on recently popped zits but not this one. This one will make an open sore worse and painful. But I would rather save money and work with this one instead. Probably shouldn&#x27;t be putting anything on open sores anyway. Oops.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!!!&lt;br /&gt;very happy!!! Deduced side and calms the pain of disgusting acne!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe how great this works!!! Amazed....</li>
    <li> I bought this, looking for a dupe for Mario Badescu Drying Lotion - the ingredient list is a bit different, but it seems to work just as well for me!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne but I get the occasional horrid zit. I&#x27;m not kidding this stuff is a game changer. I can&#x27;t resist picking at my face and by result often make zits worse. this stuff makes a difference over night. and put on early enough prevents me from picking. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a holy grail product. I have fair, acne prone skin and this dries pimples up instantly. Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm but goes bad quickly with frequently use even with the sealed cap.  I recommend the Mario drying lotion instead.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It feels effective when I apply the solution.  It dries quickly and usually helps reduce the acne overnight.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for a perfect acne medication that will make all of your acne disappear, this isn&#x27;t the product.  It helps A LOT, but it&#x27;s certainly not flawless.  I still have some acne the next morning, but it is nevertheless a lot better than the night before.</li>
    <li> Menopause creates a lot of havoc...I have been getting blemishes a and was buying a more expensive version..this works just as well if not better</li>
    <li> A++++++++++ item.so good.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !!!!! I&#x27;m so happy with results . It helped to clear up my acne !!! You should give a try !</li>
    <li> Works great to dry out the blemishes, but need to consistently apply it. It does take away some of the redness, but only temporarily.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well overnight on light acne.  I did see some improvement on spots, this does not dry out my skin at all (I have oily/combo).  I would not recommend for deep or cystic acne.  This stuff is just as good as the more expensive mario badescu drying lotion.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried every lotion and potion and this is the only one that actually works for my teenage daughter. She applies this with a Q-tip at night before bed to any hint of a new pimple and by morning it&#x27;s dried out and already going away. Tip: Don&#x27;t shake it and dip q-tip to the bottom where the pink settles.</li>
    <li> Works just the same and at a fraction of the price of the mario badescu one. And this one doesnt flake off when i move my face. And it comes with more pink stuff, not just 80% alcohol.</li>
    <li> the only overnight pimple medicine that actually works!!  walgreens used to carry it and i was super sad when they discontinued it; was so excited to see it on here.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my son.  He usually gets these from Walgrens but Amazon&#x27;s prices are much better.  This product really works and I  would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I wish I discovered this sooner. Works great...overnight for the really small/just beginning to show pimples, and a little longer for full blown red, inflammed ones.</li>
    <li> I wish this existed when I was a teenager and into my twenties, when I would use Clearasil or Oxy 10 to little avail.&lt;br /&gt;(Fortunately, my pimples came out only about one at a time even in those days.)&lt;br /&gt;In any event, this is amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Dries them right up!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Dries up my pimples/acne in a day. Best thing ever. Its similar to mario badescu drying lotion only on dif ingredient! Everything else is the same</li>
    <li> This stuff is powerful and very accurate to it&#x27;s title. This is a 10% salicylic acid drying lotion, and compared to Proactiv&#x27;s facial mask its 4% stronger. This stuff is wonderful and dries up blemishes with two bedtime applications of the treatment on singular blemishes.</li>
    <li> I have had acne for 8 years and I have been going to a dermatologist for about 7. I was put on antibiotics, creams, washes and nothing worked. however, the active ingredient in this is sulfur which is what is in the prescription, several hundred dollar creams from the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;It will dry up your pimples over night and you might end up with a white head the next morning.  This leaves a pink mark where you apply it, so use it only at night or under foundation as it makes a good pimple concealer!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT SHAKE! dip a cotton swab in and apply.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff- even my husband uses it-lol. its now a staple product in our house that stays on the vanity counter.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for years!!!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!!  It not any clears your blemishes almost overnight but takes away any discoloration on your skin!!!</li>
    <li> dries my pimples in one day. The box was crushed when i got it so I was a bit annoyed. Need to work on better ways to package your items.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper option for Mario Badescu&#x27;s drying lotion, this is not it, looks like it but doesn&#x27;t work like it.</li>
    <li> I use this at nite but for cystic acne, the prescription Tazorac takes the swelling down faster.  Smell is not over powering and doesn&#x27;t make the skin red after washing it off in the morning.  A must for warm summer evenings while sleeping.</li>
    <li> I occasionally will have a pimple show up and this stuff is great for when that happens. I just put a dab on with a q-tip and leave it overnight, the next morning it is much improved.</li>
    <li> Thanks a lot. It shipped, and the product is great as always!</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping...thought it would work a bit faster.</li>
    <li> This a great lower price alternative to the one Sephora sells.  It works great when you have a spot.</li>
    <li> This is a decent spot treatment for certain kinds of blemishes. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year, and I find that it&#x27;s sort of hit-or-miss. In my experience, it didn&#x27;t do much for cystic/ingrown pimples, blackheads, papules/zits without heads. It DID however, work well on whiteheads and erupted/popped pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever popped a zit and was left with an oozy aftermath, only to wake up the next morning with a scab-like crust on the offending area, tempted to pick at it yet again?? When I apply this to popped zits, it soaks up all the excess fluid to prevent the &amp;#34;scabbing&amp;#34; from happening. This also works well on whiteheads, gently drying it up and bringing the gross stuff to the surface (if you haven&#x27;t done so with your fingers or cotton buds already). I&#x27;ve tried this on bumps that I can feel &amp;#34;coming on&amp;#34; -- but sometimes it&#x27;s hit or miss -- sometimes the bump will disappear, but other times there&#x27;s no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a glass bottle. It&#x27;s kind of annoying that the plastic label is attached to the protective seal; you have to be careful not to rip it all off if you want to save the label/ingredients list/whatnot. It smells of rubbing alcohol. You have to let the pink sediment settle to the bottom. You dip a cotton swab into the bottle to touch the sediment and bring it back up and apply to affected areas. My first bottle actually dried out before I got to finish it, but I managed to &amp;#34;revive&amp;#34; it by simply adding more rubbing alcohol. That said, it can be drying, so keep a good moisturizer at hand, especially if you plan on using it a few nights in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this spot treatment is just OK. It seems like I have to wait for the zits to come to a head before this can be effective. But for whiteheads and &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; pimples, this does work and help heal them gently.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I used it on a real trouble spot, and it began clearing it away within a few days.  It will take maybe one more bottle to finish, but since my blemish was very deep, this is to be expected.  And for most run-of -the-mill uses, it will be more than  adequate.  Do not shake it up!  And do not double dip your swabs--and you must use a swab with this solution--it cannot be applied with a finger tip, due to its nature.  It is a hideous color, and it will stain painted surfaces and clothing, so be aware.  You cannot really wear it out--no one is this color!  But it is a very good overnight treatment.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it, I really did.  It&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t do what&#x27;s advertized, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different and it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the more expensive brands</li>
    <li> For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of some extremely stubborn whiteheads. I had a couple of small clusters (4 just under my hairline and another 4 just above my left eyebrow, and two small ones on my right cheek) I&#x27;ve tried a variety of acne treatments. First, I tried several different salicylic acid treatments. I tried 1 by Clean and Clear that didn&#x27;t really do much of anything. Next, I tried a Neutrogenia 2% Benzoil Peroxide solution. Again, didn&#x27;t really do much of anything. Next, I tried a 10% Benzoil Peroxide solution. It did get rid of a couple of the smaller whiteheads, but it started really irritating my skin. My skin is extremely allergy prone. It wasn&#x27;t an allergic reaction, but more redness and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was poking around Ulta and saw this product. I had never even heard of it. But I had a $3.50 off coupon, so it cost me less than $6.99. I was pretty skeptical. Especially since I saw that it was a sulfer solution. I was concerned that the smell would be horrible (sulfur usually smells like rotten eggs) I had never even heard of using sulfer for acne. It also sounded odd. I didn&#x27;t know what to think when I first saw the bottle. There was some clear liquid and a pink solution.  There was a strong temptation to shake the bottle. But the directions clearly say not to shake it. I followed the directions. I dabbed  it directly to the whiteheads just before bed and let it dry. This stuff is intended to be used right before bed. It dries really fast. I brush my teeth in the bathroom in our basement. By the time I get back upstairs, it&#x27;s already dry. It does resemble calamine lotion when you first apply it. You don&#x27;t need to apply a ton. Just a thin layer over the whiteheads does the trick. Once it dries, it is very close to my natural skin tone. In fact, you barely tell I have it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 5 nights. I noticed a difference after the first use. The longer I use it, the better it works.It has made a noticeable difference in my whiteheads. 3 of the 4 below my hairline have completely disappeared, and the last one is almost gone as well. As for the ones above my eyebrow, they too have shrunk in size and disappearing as well. Same for the one on my cheek. I have no clue how this stuff works, but it definitely does. This stuff is great for whiteheads. As I said before, my skin is extremely allergy prone, but I have had no problems whatsover with this product. I forget I even have it on. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me itch. It is suitable for sensitive skin. If I can use it, anyone can use it. I very rarely get zits, so I can&#x27;t really say how it will work on that, but on whiteheads, it works great. I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough. It truly is magic. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s really good at drying out zits.  I have used it for years.  My husband and daughter love it too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews unless I really love or hate something. Bye Bye Blemish is a LOVE! I am shocked at how this product cleared even my cystic acne. I would definitely reorder this product!</li>
    <li> it works! just be careful with dryness and only apply to spot. also, very few things work for me and this actually did so im pretty happy about that &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It was delivered late but I eventually got the item after I sent the email.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this item because people said this is good for pimples, but there&#x27;s no dramatic thing happens so far.&lt;br /&gt;I will use this product constantly to see what happens but for now I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. If I wash my face after put this on, there is weird smell going on...&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s because of sulfur...</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with mild adult acne and one of my problems is that my acne stays for a long time, is itchy and very red. A friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;m happy I am using it! It does work but not overnight. Perhaps you see immediate effect after the first apply on the specific spot but at least for me it takes still 3-4 days to dry out. Unlike other feedbacks I read, my skin didnt become dry. Actually for me, it reduces the size without causing flaky skin. I&#x27;ve used prescribed spot treatments, tried Body Shop Tea Tree Oil, Boots Dermocare and Sudocreme but so far this is the one that&#x27;s most effective for me - at least for now. I will still keep on searching for more effective stuff though :)</li>
    <li> Worked really well for problem spots. I&#x27;d try it again.</li>
    <li> For decades, I bought this products OTC at Boot&#x27;s in London before I found it in the States...I have always LOVED THIS STUFF!!!  I started using it when I was about 10-11 and it was a lifesaver.  Luckily, I never had many blemishes on my face, but I used to have an eczema-like rash on my arms and ByeBye helped ease the redness and itch.  ByeBye also works for various &amp;#34;bumps, bites and lumps&amp;#34; that grow on the skin.  Possibly, it is the camphor that soothes mosquito bites, etc. and the &amp;#34;pinkish&amp;#34; hue makes sore, red skin look less heated.  It&#x27;s a necessity in sub-tropical hellhole climates like NOLA.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve found in years! it actually works...I have a lot of scarring and this helps my breakouts, but i suggest that you don&#x27;t mess with your face because you&#x27;ll cause scarring, just let this product do its thing and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
    <li> Really upset about this product. It didnt help at all. So far its been 3 days? and it made my acne worse. When i put it on a pimple, it dries it up and it leaves a scab. Its hard to remove in the morning and leaves a nasty scar. My acne is really bad now. i have severe acne and i try everything for myself but nothing seems to work.</li>
    <li> This product used to work pretty well for me for a little while, but I just ordered another bottle and it has done nothing for the my pimples and am very disappointed. Works well for some though</li>
    <li> Really works. I love this stuff and will buy more.</li>
    <li> once u see a pimple coming you place this the night before and when you wake up the pimpmle is almost gone. you can only put it on at night because it dries white like chalk. its not a entire face  application but a on spot treatment</li>
    <li> Will dry up &amp; rid you of a nasty pimple or blemish over night! Best product I have ever found!</li>
    <li> Well didn&#x27;t work for me but I am sure that isn&#x27;t the same for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I get body welts. Some sort of adult acne/food allergic reaction or something, related to dairy or something and this is the only thing that helps. By morning they are much smaller. I take zinc pills which helps too.</li>
    <li> Product is ok - not a miracle, though it did shrink my one cystic acne I had over about 5 weeks (using 4-5 nights a week). It seems to have stalled at the original size it was when I first noticed, or at least slowed the shrinking, but I do see a difference for sure. I&#x27;ll continue to use it for that until it&#x27;s gone. For other minor blemishes, it seems hit-or-miss; some go away if I catch them right away, others I have to wait for it to get bad before this will do anything. It&#x27;s odd. I found the other reviews confusing too - some say to ignore the directions and shake it, others say not to. I tried both and for me it&#x27;s better to follow the directions and NOT shake. I think the pink part gets too diluted when you shake it together and isn&#x27;t as effective. Maybe this is better for someone with super sensitive or dry skin, but mine&#x27;s pretty darn sensitive (but oily) and I had no negative/drying reaction to it. I&#x27;d reorder if I found it on sale somewhere (which I did after this seller cancelled the order). I haven&#x27;t found the smell offensive (smells like rubbing alcohol but dissipates quickly). Also some reviews have said it just dries up and flakes off your skin - I usually put 2 layers, letting each dry really well, and it seems to be a good system for me. There&#x27;s certainly less in the morning, but it&#x27;s still working...I have yet to see a stain on my pillowcases either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note about seller: won&#x27;t use them again, they marked the item shipped, when I emailed to ask for tracking info a week after it should have been here, (last day of the estimated window) they were all of a sudden OOS. Did refund though.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my teenage son. It looks like it&#x27;s working for him. He doesn&#x27;t get a lot of pimples, but when he does he uses this product. Cost much less than Badescu drying lotion but does the same job.</li>
    <li> great spot product - but don&#x27;t do what the other reviewer said. i tested this product both shaking and not shaking, and not shaking is better. you get a thicker topical application when you don&#x27;t mix it</li>
    <li> This product only works to get rid of current acne and zits, not prevent them. So this can&#x27;t really be called an acne medicine because it only treats the problem on the surface. It does, however, work to dry out acne to help it disappear faster so use with another acne medication</li>
    <li> Didnt work for me.I tried to shrink down a huge pimple on my nose but it didnt work.</li>
    <li> Why pay full price when this works just as well as name brand variants!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had some really good results with this. It does not scar or burn the skin, like some other chemical based peels/drying agents. It actually lightens up scars too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) I usually keep this overnight. I bought a couple of 100% pure soft cotton hand towels and place them over my pillow, since this stuff rubs off when dry. This way I don&#x27;t have pink pillows with a rotten egg smell :)&lt;br /&gt;2) Use a makeup/fine paint brush instead of a q-tip to apply it. There is a lot of waste with the q-tip.</li>
    <li> Sometimes works. Sometimes doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product REALLY works! A small dab is all it takes. My bottle should last a long time!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff,  im on my third bottle.  Im 44 &amp; 16 year old daughter uses it too.</li>
    <li> I used this back when I was a teenager with bad acne... I would actually put it all over my face (except eye and mouth area) at night and wash it off in the morning and it worked really well. My skin has since cleared up, but I recently purchased it again to put on the occasional blemish I get now. It still works very well. It won&#x27;t completely get rid of a zit, but it&#x27;s definitely the best acne treatment I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried at least 20 different products). When spot treating, blemishes reduce in size significantly, and when applying it to a whole area (in a very thin layer!), I definitely notice my face isn&#x27;t as oily. I absolutely recommend trying this product because it really works whether you have bad acne or just get the occasional blemish.</li>
    <li> This has helped my sons acne so far to dry up quicker.  It is not used to prevent but in helping to dry up the blemishes it does stop it from spreading.  We are hoping he doesn&#x27;t become immune to it but so far pretty good!!</li>
    <li> used 3days and i think it worked.my. new acne got dry and healed. i think it is nice</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well.  To avoid wasting it, I store it upside down.  When I open it, I just use a touchup brush to what&#x27;s on the inside of the lid, where it&#x27;s concentrated.  Gets rid of a blemish faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Lone this product! Pimples dried up the day after</li>
    <li> Helps dry up zits quicker than most products, have been buying this (or similar brands) for years, husband even uses it, basically this is the same as the type Mario Badescu sells.  Works exactly the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now, and I love it. It has never disappointed me and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. However, I&#x27;m sure with overuse it would dry out skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations about this product and that it will be magic that makes zits disappear overnight. I&#x27;m pretty sure NO product will do that. But this is a good product to speed up the process. Anytime I have a whitehead I apply this and it takes care of it pretty fast so I don&#x27;t have the urge to pop them (which we all know is terrible for your skin).  I get hormonal acne and it works well for me but I&#x27;m not sure how it would be on cystic acne.</li>
    <li> Definitely works but use a moisturizer over it!! It is extremely drying as the name implies,  and will leave your skin flaky.</li>
    <li> This is FANTASTIC  PRODUCT EVER! Work with all times off skin- dry,oily ,combination. Just for 2 application completely &amp;#34;erases&amp;#34; any pimple on the face or neck.The quality is outstanding !! This product the Best,wich really work with acne skin. Strongly recommend !)</li>
    <li> I went from ugly to not quite as ugly in only one night!!&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
    <li> I have occasional break outs and this dries them right up.  The best thing it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> i have bought alot of stuff over the years n this has to b the best i love it thank u</li>
    <li> It works very quickly but I have noticed that if I don&#x27;t use it every night until the pimples are completely gone then they tend to come back, as long as you stay on top of it every night it will work. It stings when you first put it on but it&#x27;s worth it to wake up with clear skin the next day. I don&#x27;t know if this is normal or not, but mine has sort of dried up (I bought it a few months ago). It dries out your skin pretty bad so make sure to use a good moisturizer or oil as well (coconut oil is a miracle worker and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores).</li>
    <li> I know there is no such thing as a miracle product but this is very close!&lt;br /&gt;I dont really have many breakouts but I had one the day this arrived, after my nightly skin&lt;br /&gt;routine I put this on and when I woke up it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I use sulfur soap with a cleaning brush, then I use burts bees natural acne solutions lotion&lt;br /&gt;every night and I have great skin, plus this helps when I need it!&lt;br /&gt;great product! A+++</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work!!! Hands down the VERY BEST blemish treatment I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;ve tried many!  If you even start to see a pimple come up, put this stuff on it and it WILL go away and fast! Best product on the market for acne or random pimples!</li>
    <li> It works and does what they said dries out your zits .... If you have sensitive skin try not you use as stop treatment every day will make your skin a bit red ... I find every other day works to each is own though find what works for you ...</li>
    <li> Totally worth it! I didn&#x27;t believe it worked at first (since my skin is super irritated at times and NOTHING has worked) This is magic! Love it.</li>
    <li> Only thing I&#x27;ll use for pimples. Nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> Years ago this product line used to be found at CVS, walgreens, rite aide, etc...them it just all of the sudden disappeared! I was heartbroken because it worked wonders. Fast forward 15 years later I was at a big box store and I found what looked like to be my &amp;#34;miracle potion&amp;#34; made by another skin care line but it had parabens in it (parabens equal no good) then another brand but it was $22-$25. Finally after doing some digging I found my brand here on amazon...success! Now just one dip when I&#x27;m about to get a pimple and it&#x27;s gone the next day...got the fam back on it too :)</li>
    <li> Did work for me at all.  Did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> Trying to save a little money, and based on the other reviews, I decided to take a chance and purchased this after finishing a bottle of the Mario Badescu blemish drying product. This works just as well at a lower price. As one previous reviewer mentioned, the formula is a little thinner. I followed the directions (did not shake) and have seen noticeable reduction in blemishes in two days. I have also noticed less scaring/darkness at blemish site.</li>
    <li> It works better than anything I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Gave it super high expectations because of all the amazing reviews but, overall, it works pretty well. Not something that completely heals everything overnight, but in around two to three days,  it drastically shrunk my blemishes. Seems to work better on whiteheads and pimples near the surface as opposed to deeper pimples and cysts. Good stuff</li>
    <li> After reading all of the positive reviews I was impressed and ordered this in a heart beat. It came in like 2 days, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! It was all shaken up so I let it sit and settle. I used it that night. It does not smell that bad. It burns a lot when you first put it on, but goes away in a few seconds. I was worried about it rubbing off as I slept because I never sleep on my face so my face is always rubbing on my pillow and hands, but it was pretty much all still there in the morning. My face was broken out the most it had ever been and this made like a 90% difference! They did not all disappear overnight, but there was a drastic difference and my makeup easily covered what remained. I definitely recommend you try this!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product years. I put this on pimples (when it starts growing) and usually they diminish down on next morning.&lt;br /&gt;If you are struggling with adult pimples, it is the thing to get.</li>
    <li> This works great!  Helps dry up the erupted pimple or if you picked at it.  I just put it on before bed and the next morning it is considerable better.  Haven&#x27;t noticed as much of a difference with the pimples that are just red bumps.  Definitely worth a try though!</li>
    <li> It works. Just don&#x27;t forget to wash it off in the morning or you&#x27;ll look odd.</li>
    <li> Best ever!  I put it on a blemish at night, then cover the spot with a dot band-aid and it helps the lotion to stay on and work all night</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item several times before not just from Amazon. This product is a miracle in a bottle and very hard to find as many stores have fazed it out. If you have problem skin or an occasional break out. cystic acne, hives , blisters , etc. This product works wonders overnight and can even be used as a concealer under makeup during the day. I happen to use it a lot on bare escentuals mineral makeup. The service was quick and it was a good price with free sh.</li>
    <li> Most incredible thing ever created.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best!!! Dries out my pimples by the next morning. I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> It works, but not worth the price. You can go to the drugstore and buy a $4 spot treatment that&#x27;ll do the same thing. It&#x27;s definitely no &amp;#34;miracle.&amp;#34; There are multiple drug store products that work better than this. It&#x27;s works like the proactiv mask. Helps reduce pores, but doesn&#x27;t do miracle works on zits.</li>
    <li> works very good if you can tolerate the smell which is really horrible.</li>
    <li> great stuff really works</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> Outstanding product for drying up super oily patches in the t-zone.  Dramatic improvement with each and every use.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
</ol>
