      <li>Nice product.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>But i am most satisfied with physicians formula&#x27;s blush.  </li>
      <li>I love this palette of blush.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite blush.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t powdery or cakey, its a perfect middle zone.</li>
      <li>Wish they made this color in a cream......a better choice for drier skin.</li>
      <li>I love all of their products because they tend to stay on all day.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this for years and love it.</li>
      <li>and this shade looks perfect with my skin tone in summer with a tan or in winter when I am very white.</li>
      <li>the Blushing Rose gives me the right balance of color without the clown like appearance.  </li>
      <li>Nothing impressive just a pretty standard blush.</li>
      <li>The mixture is just perfect for a soft natural looking blush.</li>
      <li>on smooth.</li>
      <li>sometimes the color pallet you want is not always available, so I found it at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Animal cruelty free.</li>
      <li>So far so good though.</li>
      <li>The quality is great, and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Blushing Rose is a beautiful light pink, and it looks natural.</li>
      <li>It does not last more than 4-5 hours, but I would rather reapply my blush than have redness from zits!</li>
      <li>Is not harsh, more so to add colour to your face.</li>
      <li>Love the natural feel and look of this blush.</li>
      <li>I love it, the color is a natural blush color.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and this is way to pink for me.</li>
      <li>This goes on at just the right shade.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the little brush that comes with it, but the color is just perfect.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice shade of pink and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>You really only need a very light dusting to get the rosy glow, otherwise you will look like a sunburnt clown.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I love the palette blush rather than a single color blush.</li>
      <li>That makes it unusual for me.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m use to light to sheer blushes...</li>
      <li>Just be careful to not drop it, because like many compacts, the blush will shatter.</li>
      <li>This is a high quality product that I would recommend to anyone!</li>
      <li>Somewhat lighter than I expected, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Beautiful nuanced  pink that works year round.</li>
      <li>Add less, because you can always layer more if needed.</li>
      <li>Like the powder, but may try a cream as I am older, also would go with a peachier color</li>
      <li>I particularly like their blush line.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been super basic when it comes to make up (foundation + mascara)</li>
      <li>I tended to wear my blush too dark and looked for a product that would be more natural.</li>
      <li>It has a very natural hue and the color lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>Bought this because a few pale ladies on here said it worked great for their skin</li>
      <li>First off makeup is a very personal product.</li>
      <li>I tried something different when I ran out of the first palette, and it didn&#x27;t compare , so I ordered this again</li>
      <li>so I was looking for a blush that felt natural.</li>
      <li>Nice product, but the compact was broken upon arrival.</li>
      <li>Works for me without breakouts, Not sure that I am getting older though that I will be able to use this dry product.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this product especially since I usually buy the most expensive name brand products.</li>
      <li>This blend is a little too pink even for me with my light skin tone, so i haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
      <li>I am a natural blonde with lighter skin and this is working well for me</li>
      <li>Looks natural on mu cheeks and it is last longer.</li>
      <li>I have used blush from all kinds of companies including Chanel and other high end name brands.</li>
      <li>I was a little disappointed in this product in that it didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would have liked it too.</li>

    <li> Been using this product for years so I knew what I was purchasing. Previously bought in store but sometimes the color pallet you want is not always available, so I found it at Amazon.</li>

    <li> This blend is a little too pink even for me with my light skin tone, so i haven&#x27;t used it much. It is a good product though and I would order a different color next time.</li>
    <li> It has a very nice shade of pink and looks very natural. I only gave it four stars because I found that it didn&#x27;t transfer well to the brush. There was also a little scuff mark on the package, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal. The extra mini brush was a very pleasant bonus!</li>
    <li> covers well with no break outs.  product is affordable. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love how it goes on.  The color works well for me.  I don&#x27;t think I will need a summer blush and and winter blush, I think I can use it all year round.</li>

    <li> definitely one the best powder blush-ons I&#x27;ve tried. Looks natural on mu cheeks and it is last longer. Definitely a spot on!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump. It stays in cake form.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth. I&#x27;ve used this before and like it for my coloring.</li>
    <li> I always buy Physicians Formula for my blush and coverup. The quality is great, and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Blushing Rose is a beautiful light pink, and it looks natural. Just be careful to not drop it, because like many compacts, the blush will shatter.</li>
    <li> Beautiful blush! This goes on at just the right shade. I tended to wear my blush too dark and looked for a product that would be more natural. This is perfect and a great price. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to get the shade you want. Will use this for now on.</li>
    <li> I am 65 years old and have been using Physicians Formula products for the past 5 years.  I love all of their products because they tend to stay on all day.

    <li> Nice color. I swirl my own brush (I never use the included ones) and blow off the excess and blend, blend, blend.  Add less, because you can always layer more if needed. Nice product. Animal cruelty free.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Works for me without breakouts, Not sure that I am getting older though that I will be able to use this dry product. Don&#x27;t want it get stuck in my wrinkles. So far so good though.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and this is way to pink for me. However, that&#x27;s my fault. I love Physician Formula products and will continue to buy from them.</li>

    <li> This blush does not cause breakouts! That makes it unusual for me. I wish it lasted longer. It does not last more than 4-5 hours, but I would rather reapply my blush than have redness from zits!</li>
    <li> Great blush that has excellent longevity. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect shade</li>
    <li> Great product line!  This is the touch of color you are looking for.  Not too noticeable, yet does the job!</li>
    <li> Slept with the blush still on and my skin did not break out the next day. I find this blush is too pink and so I just brush a little bit each time. I use this along with the PF bronzer.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  I like it.  It is a good product.  I would recommend this as a good buy.</li>
    <li> Great color mixture for my olive skin tone!</li>

    <li> Another great product by Physicians Formula!  The color is great and goes on nicely.  I only wish a mirror was attached.</li>
    <li> I love it, the color is a natural blush color. It isn&#x27;t powdery or cakey, its a perfect middle zone. I am very satisfied with this product especially since I usually buy the most expensive name brand products. I saved a lot of money purchasing this instead. I&#x27;m glad I found a good blush that is inexpensive and looks good all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m use to light to sheer blushes... This one has some serious pigment. You really only need a very light dusting to get the rosy glow, otherwise you will look like a sunburnt clown. Not complaining though, this blush will go a long way for the money. Perfect shade too.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect blush I&#x27;m very fair skinned and it looks amazing on me! Deff recommend this to anyone</li>
