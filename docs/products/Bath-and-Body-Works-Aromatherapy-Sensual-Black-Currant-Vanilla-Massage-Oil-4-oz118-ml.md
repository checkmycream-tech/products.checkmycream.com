      <li>Love the smell of this stuff - it lingers in the room after I&#x27;ve given my wife a massage and makes me think about the closeness we share during that time.</li>
      <li>With many lotions and oils, you find yourself reaching for the bottle to get another squirt.  </li>

      <li>I opened the bottle and immediately was In love.</li>

      <li>The smell is reminiscent of Euphoria by Calvin Klein (which ironically I own, ha ha).</li>
      <li>By far, this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>After a shower, I used this on my freshly shaved legs.</li>
      <li>A little bit of this massage oil lasts a long time and smells great!</li>
      <li>Will be buying more, but I&#x27;m going to purchase a different type of container to put it in.</li>
      <li>Other than that, quite satisfied!</li>

      <li>I love this particular scent and oil, we bought some years ago and when we moved over seas left it here.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Quality is better than I expected</li>
      <li>The smell is a very comforting smell.</li>
      <li>I have tried a couple of the other Body and Bath flavors, but this one is truly my favorite.  </li>
      <li>By the time I took my bedtime shower, I could still smell it (not as strong, but definitely still there), my legs were still soft and silky, and no skin reactions.</li>
      <li>Not too oily, yet oily enough that it does not seep in too quickly.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this one.</li>
      <li>This oil is used for many things, such as a dry skin this oil helps keep the shine on your skin, it also serves to massage body which wants.</li>
      <li>The Black Currant Vanilla massage oil is a &#x27;Fantastic Product.&#x27;  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, so I had my reservations about stinging and breaking out into a rash, but I tried it anyway.</li>
      <li>And by the way, I haven&#x27;t ever found it anywhere at a cheaper price than what Amazon offers.  </li>
      <li>Put a moderate amount into the palm of your hand and you will have plenty enough to complete a full back massage.  </li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t have to re-apply frequently; it really lasts a long time!</li>
      <li>I keep a couple of different flavors on the nightstand: then when the mood and opportunity present themselves, you are ready to go.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is everything I expected except the scent is very strong and when it sinks into the skin it is almost hard to wash off.</li>

    <li> This smells AMAZING. I opened the bottle and immediately was In love. I will definitely be bathing in this tomorrow!</li>
    <li> This feels wonderful for massage.  Not slippery and greasy.  No unpleasant stickyiness.  Just the right amount of glide for a great massage.  The company changes scent regularly -- mine was \\&quot;Tranquil Mint\\&quot; with peppermint and rosemary.  Contains sunflower oil and ???</li>
    <li> Great oil, glass bottle, the smell is fantastic! Will not suite for people who do not like strong vanilla smell&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil!&lt;br /&gt;Quality is better than I expected</li>
    <li> came broken to bits and I just didn&#x27;t want to deal with returns.</li>
    <li> The Black Currant Vanilla massage oil is a &#x27;Fantastic Product.&#x27;  I have tried a couple of the other Body and Bath flavors, but this one is truly my favorite.  The oil scent is not too overbearing, yet is provides a very decent aroma for the massage.  The oil seems to have the perfect consistency for what it was designed for.  Not too oily, yet oily enough that it does not seep in too quickly.  With many lotions and oils, you find yourself reaching for the bottle to get another squirt.  Not with this product.  Put a moderate amount into the palm of your hand and you will have plenty enough to complete a full back massage.  I keep a couple of different flavors on the nightstand: then when the mood and opportunity present themselves, you are ready to go.  I&#x27;m betting you will like this massage oil.  And by the way, I haven&#x27;t ever found it anywhere at a cheaper price than what Amazon offers.  Amazon Prime - the only way to go.</li>
    <li> I love this particular scent and oil, we bought some years ago and when we moved over seas left it here. Finally got to use it all up when we got back but now...i need more. highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> The Sensual Black Currant Vanilla Massage oil from B and B feels and smells great. Not over powering yet it is fully emerging. I will buy more in the future. One of the best oils I have ever bought and I have bought about 5 different brands and 13 fragrances.</li>
    <li> Best massage oil I ever used.</li>
    <li> What a great sensual smell.  Not too strong just right.  With no oily residue.  Many many compliements from the recipient.</li>
    <li> Love this item. Perfect condition and wonderful smell! The smell is reminiscent of Euphoria by Calvin Klein (which ironically I own, ha ha). I love these massage oils by Bath and Body works. I&#x27;ve owned the Eucalyptus scent massage oil and enjoyed it immensely so I decided to buy this one to try out for Valentine&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil for massage! Not sticky, not greasy, smells great. After 2 kids, this oil has saved our sex life!</li>
    <li> And the glass bottle could break in a tub if dropped. Ok in a bath, buy spearmint and rose petals work just as well.</li>
    <li> This oil is used for many things, such as a dry skin this oil helps keep the shine on your skin, it also serves to massage body which wants.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my hands. It smells amazing and the smell lasts longer than any lotion or oil that I have tried. The smell is a very comforting smell. I will continue to purchase this scent.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, and the oil is not sticky like some oils are. This is perfect for massages.</li>
    <li> This stuff is everything I expected except the scent is very strong and when it sinks into the skin it is almost hard to wash off. I&#x27;m a dab of cologne behind the neck type of guy so the strong smell for me or my girl is too much. If you&#x27;re fine with that then it&#x27;s an excellent product; otherwise look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use for giving my husband massages, but we still have about a week until he comes home. So, I decided to try it myself. After a shower, I used this on my freshly shaved legs. I have sensitive skin, so I had my reservations about stinging and breaking out into a rash, but I tried it anyway. Ladies, no more reapplying lotion during the winter months! Not only did this stuff smell light and sexy, but I didn&#x27;t have to put lotion on my legs later in the day. By the time I took my bedtime shower, I could still smell it (not as strong, but definitely still there), my legs were still soft and silky, and no skin reactions. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot either. A nickel-sized amount covered one leg with ease and no oily residue. The scent of this is very nice and it is not overpowering. Actually, if it were stronger I wouldn&#x27;t like it. Will be buying more, but I&#x27;m going to purchase a different type of container to put it in. Oily hands and glass do not mix well. Other than that, quite satisfied!</li>
    <li> It is harder to find this scent from Bath and Body Works.  By far, this is my favorite.  The oil is smooth and massages are great with this oil</li>
    <li> The aroma is so pleasing without being overpowering. It lasts for quite a while after use so you are reminded of your relaxing and soothing experience</li>
    <li> I love b&amp;bw massage oils but not this smell so much! My boyfriend and I really enjoy the eucalyptus spearmint. This scent is just ok. The oil itself is great though.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a simple oil for you and your partner, this is it! The smell is very nice and isn&#x27;t overwhleming. I put a towel down so it doen&#x27;t ruin the sheets. No complaints here, and the price is great as well!</li>
    <li> A little bit of this massage oil lasts a long time and smells great! Perfect for a relaxing massage because it doesn&#x27;t take much oil and you don&#x27;t have to re-apply frequently; it really lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I bought massage oil for use on my girl friend. She absolutely loved the smell! It&#x27;s great scent.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff - it lingers in the room after I&#x27;ve given my wife a massage and makes me think about the closeness we share during that time.</li>
    <li> Bath and Body Works aromatherapy oils. very nice scent. no oily residue. also seems to help with getting a better nights sleep.</li>
    <li> This is not at all the highest quality massage oil we own, but for the price I would buy it again. It does not get sticky or leave weird residue like some cheaper oils do. The smell is great... Subtle, but there. A little goes a long way.</li>
