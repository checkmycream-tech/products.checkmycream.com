<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Poor quality!! :(&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how some of the reviewers gave 5 stars. Did i receive a different batch? The paper rips in half when I pull it. Happened quite a few times. It was quite frustrating</li>
    <li> It does its job! I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that are complaining about the quality. The paper doesn&#x27;t rip when I wax and it seems very sturdy to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I have no complaints</li>
    <li> Great price for exactly what you would expect. The texture is a little softer than what comes in most wax kits but they work just exactly the same. They are I think the tiniest bit smaller too but not enough to matter. Perfect for me because I always use up the strips long before I use a whole container of wax.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected  Good service</li>
    <li> Got here in about 3 weeks. Got the package and was very pleased with the amount of waxing strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has atleast 100 waxing strips that are supposed to be used for arms or legs, but I cut them up for my eyebrows and work great!&lt;br /&gt;I received two large packages so about 200 in total. Great product.</li>
    <li> omg these suck so horribly!! every time I go to pull it off a ton of remnant strip is left on my skin! It takes FOREVER to get it off. I obsolutely do NOT recommend that anyone buys this product! i&#x27;ll be using the rest as nail polish remover wipes, etc as these strips remind me of cotton balls.</li>
    <li> Just awful! Rips and stays on skin!</li>
    <li> awful!!!!!!!!!!!!  I tried using these on a client and they are soooo thin that when I went to pull the strip off, it just ripped and the part with wax on it stayed on my client&#x27;s body!!!!!  The papers just shred!  Also, they are not even cut straight!  Every strip is curved!  DO NOT USE!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like because didn&#x27;t have 100 hair removal only 70.</li>
    <li> Strips break in half while waxing - not a good product for home wax.</li>
    <li> Material is too thin causing it hard to pull off face, body etc</li>
    <li> Total garbage. Waste of money. Ended up throwing them away. They are the quality of a paper towel and can tear them like paper</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectation. It is thick and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a nonwoven wax strips and this perfectly fit in to my search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product versus the woven strips</li>
    <li> Is as described and expected, no unhappy surprises</li>
    <li> I like it, they are easy to use and work just fine</li>
    <li> These strips are good for nothing!!! The material is horrible and it doesn&#x27;t take the wax off, they are not doing the job.</li>
    <li> These came from China.  They had a strong food smell...fish sauce. Going back!</li>
    <li> i order for my wife is very resionable price and also very good size also strong enough  i recomended every body</li>
    <li> I hate this strips ,its very thick ,its not easy to pull out ...i dont recommend those strips..don&#x27;t buy it..</li>
    <li> excellent price and quality</li>
    <li> expected the round one and came the flat sticks. thought to return but we were in urgent need so used</li>
    <li> the reason why I gave it 3 stars was because it took them around 2 weeks or little bit more to arrive! otherwise it is a good product at least it worked for me&lt;br /&gt;La razon por la que le di 3 estrellas fue porque se tardo poquito mas de 2 semanas en llegar. Sin duda es un buen producto o al menos a mi me sirvio!</li>
    <li> great product, i just bought another one.</li>
    <li> Great for At-Home Waxing. No issues</li>
    <li> Duct tape would have worked better than these wax strips. Cheap, but don&#x27;t waste your money! Barely stuck on. I&#x27;ll stick to shaving this time instead!</li>
    <li> really bad quality, its so thin strip that the wax comes out the other side when you press it to your skin. Really it makes it impossible to work with, gets sticky and breaks when you pull it. Horrible...too bad I got 2 packs...</li>
    <li> Please beware. These are very inferior quality strips coming from China. I had to return them.</li>
    <li> just as advertised. came on time and works well! I would definitely recommend this buyer to others. overall, good purchase.</li>
    <li> I like to wax my legs at home but the wax kits only come with a few strips, which means having to use them over and over until they are super sticky.  Buying the bulk pack allows me to use 2-3 times and they are more sturdy than the strips in the kit.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if the manufacturer sent me wrong stuff or if it was suppose to be like this. gave me a few bruises as the strip just stretched than pulling off the wax. Hate it!</li>
    <li> this work really well! at first I bought the Gigi muslin roll but I was very disappointed.  Bought these to replace the muslin and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! really well made and doesn&#x27;t let the wax seep through!</li>
    <li> Works awesome and will last me forever. Good deal!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it will last you a treatment or maybe even two depending on what you&#x27;re doing. It literally takes months to get to you though. BUT if you just go to sally&#x27;s around the corner, you can get about 20 times as much for 9.99.</li>
    <li> Almost every single strip broke when I tried to use them to wax my legs.  I have been waxing for years and this is the first time I have had the strips break.  I tried adjusting the wax to different temperatures, but that did not solve the problem.  I also tried using the product in different areas, but they still broke.</li>
    <li> I only used them once but so far so good.  They are much better than other ones I tried, no loose strings.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace my Clean + Easy waxing strips based on the many good reviews and low cost.  I was extremely disappointed with this purchase because once I applied wax on my legs then applied these paper strips  and pressed down twice, the wax immediately seeped through the paper which sucks. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use, perfect for waxing! I cut it in small piece when I need it and do the job as well as the precut..</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay, but not wide. Why are they so expensive?</li>
    <li> yes get these. these are perfect strips. they really stick to your body and are easy to peel so i recommend them :)</li>
    <li> if you want hair removal for legs its great. bikini area and underarm don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> not good at all, cheap product</li>
    <li> Strips are really low in quality and shred or tear in layers when in use. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These work so well. I haven&#x27;t had anything but good experiences when using them and would definitely recommend to anyone looking fox wax strips.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these strips for a while now and I actually really like them! I use Gigi Brazilian body wax and these work perfectly for pulling off the wax and hair all together. Sometimes, you aren&#x27;t going to get all of the wax off depending on how much wax you put on and when you put the strip on the wax. I usually put the strip on the wax right away because some of the areas in the wax on your skin will dry a lot faster than you think! And you do want to put a good amount of wax on not too thin, not too thick. Great product and I will keep buying! :)</li>
    <li> These strips did not work for me. Every time I attempted to wax, the wax slid right off and stayed on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and in good shape. Very cheap. Works fine.</li>
    <li> It tears while pulling the strip. My skin also developed patches at the places the strip got stuck while pulling.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Worked well and we are happy using it.&lt;br /&gt;Also reached by the promised date.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend this product to anybody.</li>
    <li> Packaged nice and they work well.</li>
    <li> The key word for this product is NONWOVEN! In my opinion this material is not good for waxing at all. Parts of it get stuck to the skin and gets messy. You have to keep the wax really warm otherwise nothing gets done. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> These work just great, they are easy to cut if you need smaller pieces! Just the delivery was long and slow.</li>
    <li> There is not 100 in this set. There is only 80. Tried contacting store they claimed they couldn&#x27;t find my order information. They also have a funny smell to them and are smaller and thinner than other ones.</li>
    <li> not very good quality, this wax strips are not good, don&#x27;t order them ended throwing them away . .  .</li>
    <li> The worst ,, tears and sticks with the wax on your body</li>
    <li> I tried them with sally hanson body wax. The strips were torn apart. I am not sure if the wax is too sticky or the strips are too weak, but they never worked together.&lt;br /&gt;delivery was fast</li>
    <li> These wax strips are tough and exactly what I expected them to be. However, they are a little smaller than what I&#x27;m used to, but the price makes up for what these strips lack in size. Just be forewarned that these strips take awhile to ship, so order them at least two weeks ahead of time. I ordered two packs at the start so I could order another when the first ran out and I would never be without them.</li>
    <li> First time I bought these waxing strips &amp; I like it.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Paper sticks to your skin</li>
    <li> Not what i thought they were</li>
    <li> Too thin and too small. They work, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s something better than this. Good quality/price relationship.</li>
    <li> good quality , must have for waxing purpose,however, delivery takes a whole month and many times, it&#x27;s not in stock .</li>
    <li> to small, size was not declared in item description</li>
    <li> very cheap material and wont stick to the wax&lt;br /&gt;i do not recommend, pay alittle more and you can get a better product</li>
    <li> I had to throw this product away because I tried to wax my bikini and the strips kept tearing! I ended up having to go to a salon and having the lady help me remove the wax and chunks of the strip out. People! Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy. The wax doesn&#x27;t even stick to the strips.  Seems like they observed the wax. Ended up throwing it away. But my order came very quickly.</li>
    <li> It is a soft waxing strips. It is about average quality dont expect thick hair waxing strips but worththe money</li>
    <li> A+ Service and Product!</li>
    <li> i didnt like them. They didnt work and were extremely rough on my skin. i do not recommend them at all</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Work great.  Better than the cloth strips.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t as smooth/tightly woven as the nicer strips you get with the Sally Hansen kits, but they work just the same and are a lot less expensive.  Just make sure the wax is quite hot or it doesn&#x27;t always pull all of the wax away in the bikini/Brazilian areas... O.o</li>
    <li> This was placed in a bundle package. It appears that there are 100 strips (as pictured). However, I received big strips that need to be cut or have to purchase another tool for cutting them. They work ok and I have cut them with a scissors, but was a little upset that the picture/description was not accurate</li>
    <li> not expensive but not a good method either.  Not really worth buying.  my wife and girls probably will not buy more</li>
    <li> small stripes... didnt like at all</li>
    <li> I really have ok idea why I was sent this item and I treys to contact the seller a hand full of times then I was like f it ok . But the bulk on this item was amazing made me wanna buy a wax machine and the shipping tho a week and a half tops I was amazed and I do think I will buy a waxer just because I have the papers</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, it is on our list of things to order periodically.</li>
    <li> Its completely waste of money</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot to say about these, they help me remove my hair and they&#x27;re cheap.  They seem perfectly adequate.</li>
    <li> These are thinker than the brand I usually buy. They hold up better, &amp; can be reused more often. (With cold wax of course.)</li>
    <li> They work fairly well. The quality was a bit stiff, but they held together and in some cases I would use the same strip twice. I only wax my legs, and currently I&#x27;m using the CVS brand of wax (normally I use the nair sugar/honey one but it&#x27;s been out of stock for some reason) Anyway, I am not too familiar with using this kind of wax, but there is a lot of sticky residue leftover but I don&#x27;t know if its because of the strips or just the kind of wax it is. When I get the sugar/honey kind and give it a try, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> They are made only of cotton and leave a real mess!!!</li>
    <li> I like them more than the cloth ones</li>
    <li> Very good . You get a lot of them for a good price.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it. This product with really bad quality</li>
    <li> I wouldnt reccommend these or buy them again...  tore in half everytime...</li>
    <li> Very good strips and very cheap!!! im not sure why they come from China though... so it took a little while before they were delivered!</li>
    <li> I completely do not understand why some people are having trouble with these strips. These strips worked fantastically for me. I almost didn&#x27;t buy them because of the many one star reviews. I would recommend anyone having trouble to go get waxing done professionally so that you can see the technique that aestheticians use and pay attention to how hot the wax is that they apply to your skin and how warm it is when they pull the strip off. There is a balance that needs to be obtained. If you slather hot wax on, immediately place the strip and then pull right away, the wax will be too hot and loose to bind to your hair and to the strip, so wait a bit to allow the binding effect before pulling. Maybe even give the strip a rub to make sure it attaches well, If it&#x27;s tearing, when you pull it (I don&#x27;t even know how these tore, for one of the reviewers) they seem too strong to do that, but clearly you waited too long and let the wax get too cool/hard. If you can&#x27;t figure it out, take a class or just let someone else, who knows how, do it. Not every &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; project is for everyone.</li>
    <li> Its not the best paper but it works</li>
    <li> These packs should come in larger sizes and quantities. The small amount in the pack is barely enough for one good body use.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this to use on my clients, and it works so well. As long as the wax is applied properly this strip will pull every hair in sight. Definitely a mus have.</li>
    <li> These will last a lifetime. I don&#x27;t personally use them for bikini or armpit, Just eyebrows so I cut them into strips probably will never need to buy any more, ever.</li>
    <li> I keep ordering those strip on amazon because their prize, usually in the store they cost met double. I like them better then the fabric one that leave you the residual on your legs and they are sticky.</li>
    <li> Packging SUCKS , came apart once i opened it , so had to put them in another thing to keep the rest.&lt;br /&gt;the material was fine and did the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for over 20 years now, so I&#x27;d consider myself a pro. I had to buy these strips because the wax I bought didn&#x27;t provide enough strips in the kits. That&#x27;s right kits. I used these strips with three different types of wax. In order of effectiveness I&#x27;ve found they work best with the gel type of wax. The kind that only works with the least amount of moisture. But they also work with regular sugar type cold wax. Lastly, the strips work well with the very sticky wax that only you can only remove with baby oil. I want to point out that while the strips work well with all of the aforementioned types of wax, it seems to work best in the order I just mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well they do or don&#x27;t work with hot wax. But that&#x27;s because the hot wax I have cannot be used with any wax strips, I just have to wait and rip it off with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, these strips work well with any type of cold wax, so if that&#x27;s your intended use, you should be completely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> These papers are absolutely terrible. They are made of a cheap, thin, flimsy material that falls apart when you press it against the wax/skin and rip whenever you pull it. They have no adherence to the wax, and if you&#x27;re lucky enough to pull the paper without ripping it, you will end up with a blob of wax on your leg. I do not recommend this product. Spend a bit more money and buy a better quality one. Going to the trash.</li>
    <li> I like this but .. I send a very small maybe 50 papers😔</li>
    <li> If you have coarse hair this is not for you. Not good for armpits, or bikini. that&#x27;s the only thing I wax so this product did not work for me. Wish they would have worked!!</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to use them really fast but one peace remove a bunch of hair, I recomend it.</li>
    <li> i have recently recieved the 100 hair removal wax strips and it is exactly what i needed it did the job the product is just as decribed and the shipping was super fast A+++++</li>
    <li> I like it. I can use it with my wax that remain from last time I cannot finish so it work fine and so cheap compare with amount.</li>
    <li> Great strips! They are pretty strong and soft.  Don&#x27;t fell apart like some other once.  I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> they do what they are meant to.  not much to say about them I mean it is wax paper strips.</li>
    <li> Ouch! These strips are much more painful than others I&#x27;ve used. They definitely still get the job done, and well, though.</li>
    <li> This product is a thick and slick paper.  It really didn&#x27;t work at all.  It caused added pain by having to go over the same place several times, but not really pulling out any hairs. I&#x27;ve used the same wax before and it was fine.  Also these are large sheets a little bigger than a bookmark. That&#x27;s not a problem, I just cut them down to size.  Now I still need to find a working product.</li>
    <li> Very nice and meets my needs and I believe it is of decent quality for the price. I would recommend</li>
    <li> Evidently, they don&#x27;t check their correspondance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promptly realized that I had created this order by mistake.  I requested a cancellation.  I recieved an email from the company two days after the item shipped saying that they had not recieved my email until after the item shipped (ironic, considering I sent the email well before the shipping noticewas recieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They offered to refund the item if I shipped it back, but that did not account for return shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I wasted 5 bucks.  The strips are okay, but are smaller/thinner than the ones sold in my local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work properly and it hurts!!! and doesn&#x27;t take all the hair!!!! It&#x27;s not a good product at all!!!</li>
    <li> I only got about half of them to work well. The other half was a nightmare. When I removed the strip the cotton stayed attached to the wax while still on my leg. Basically the strips were falling apart. I had to rewax the cotton to remove it all.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t strong enough to pull up wax half of the time, the top layer would just come off. Made for a painful &amp; slow waxing session. Not worth the little money they cost in my opinion.</li>
    <li> They are good and do what they are supposed to do as long as you find the right wax kit to go along with it. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its better than the cloth wax. Really holds onto the hair.at a very reasonable price. I love this wax strip</li>
    <li> Not as pictured...do not work well at all!!!</li>
    <li> I order it, and by the expected date I received it! Now I can do my waxing nicely, without any mess.. great product... for better use I cut them in pieces  if its for my eyebrows... other wise it good for waxing legs arms etc. I truly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not that I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different strips, but I&#x27;m happy with these. High quality and durable. Doesn&#x27;t disappoint in any respect for any part of the body.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive. The quality is good. I&#x27;m happy with these was strips. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for quality and good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this depilatory paper for my waxing needs. It&#x27;s even better than the one that comes in Sally Hansen waxing package. Very good price. Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive for months supply. Totally worth the buy! I will be buying more later. Just what I needed and I found it online.</li>
    <li> Zero stars. They are so thin like paper they rip when using w full strip. I threw them out</li>
    <li> Quality used be good but not any more</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t stick at all....Some reviews said it works great, but not in my case.... :( I used it with cold wax and even with hot wax...and I still get the same results.... :(</li>
    <li> Good product for a reasonable price. I like using the strips but, the quality could have been little more improved.</li>
    <li> Good quality as expected</li>
    <li> I order it, and by the expected date I received it! Now I can do my waxing nicely, without any mess.. great product</li>
    <li> I am glad that I got the epilator paper. For so long I have been using just the wax . And let me tell you the tears would flooded. Now&lt;br /&gt;I put the paper over the wax and pull the paper, NO MORE TEARS!!!</li>
    <li> So many strips in such a low price. It took about 30 days to reach my home but when I used them I felt so good about it. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This came in very fast and was surprised how soft but strong this was. I&#x27;ve reused it twice and was still sturdy. I would recommend</li>
    <li> It is a really bad quality product, there are others with better quality at Amazon. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. You get enough for a year or two supply (in my case) for upper lip strips.</li>
    <li> These things are perfect to use with the sally Hansen wax. They work amazingly. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find these on here.</li>
    <li> The quality of strips are not good. They are very thin and not strong enough. They gets broken/ripped while pulling along with wax.</li>
    <li> These are way too big for waxing your upper lip unless you cut hem down. And it&#x27;s not worth all that effort to do.</li>
    <li> I think they&#x27;re a must-have if you do your own waxing, and this product is a good one, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> great to remove wax, way better than the cloth one you can use it more than 3 or 4 times before dispose of it</li>
    <li> Good deal for lots of strips.</li>
    <li> very bad while i pull it after applying wax it just tares/cuts...hopeless it is</li>
    <li> I liked the product by the price n whn it arrived it was not wat i thought i thought it was like the ones we get in the wax box....but it does the work right ..so not bad</li>
    <li> It does not pull the facial hair out and it barely pulls off the wax.  If you can suggest another product that I could purchase I would be appreciative.</li>
    <li> more transparent than I am used to using so if doing legs or arms or even back the wax seeps through the back and your hand can become stick.  Best for face</li>
    <li> Good for ripping out hair with hot wax. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This was definitely a new experience trying to wax myself, but it was still a good purchase. Love waxing myself, but it&#x27;s hard to do.</li>
