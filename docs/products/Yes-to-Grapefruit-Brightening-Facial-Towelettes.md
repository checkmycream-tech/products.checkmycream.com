      <li>Good product overall</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s now 12pm and STILL my face feels hot to touch and is bright red!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it.  I just wouldn&#x27;t use it every day.  Now I&#x27;m just trying it on my hands where I have some age spots.  It would be nice if it takes them away.    Well, I&#x27;ve used this more than I should and I started getting a rash on my face.  It is from this product because it&#x27;s the only new thing I&#x27;ve been using.    Be careful.  if you have really sensitive skin; it may be too much for you.</li>
    <li> These are great wipes but I would not use them to remove eye makeup, they have fruit acids meant to exfoliate. There is also a warning on the package to keep away from eyes. So if you used these on your eyes and it burned, that&#x27;s prolly why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primarily I use these in the morning and then rinse with cold water. They do tingle but so far they have not irritated my rosacea-ridden, sensitive skin. I gave four out of five stars because I do not care for the fragrance. Grapefruit suggests a bright, fresh, citrus scent but they smell kinda like feet with only a tinge of grapefruit. Method makes a pink grapefruit line of natural products and they smell just like pink grapefruit! Maybe Yes To can dispatch a corporate mole to find out Method&#x27;s secret making stuff smell good.</li>
    <li> The only thing brightening about this product is the following information. Check out all of the different cucumber, tomatoes, carrots etc and what do you find? THE SAME INGREDIENTS!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not respond to a lot of products.  Using this daily to remove makeup has really improved some of the darker areas on my face.  It does make the skin a little sensitive so some night cream after helps to protect and make the skin more healthy looking. Much softer too. Easy open/close package.  Towelettes don&#x27;t dry out before you can use them all.&lt;br /&gt;Great concept. Thank you.</li>
    <li> At first it was OK, with subsequent uses my face started reacting to it, turning bright angry red, with a burning/itching sensation.  I have sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t have this problem with similar Burts Bees products so I thought it&#x27;d be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus point for cruelty free.  Maybe if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, this will be a winner.</li>
    <li> These face wipes smells like hevan are very light and don&#x27;t make my face sticky at all. And they don&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
    <li> Amazing face wipes...........I love all the YES TO line of products but these are the best facial wipes.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, most stuff dries me out really bad. But these  leave my skin glowing. I look so much better without make up now. I use this product as well as the Yes to Carrots facial wash and the Ys to Carrots over night cream. They are both amazing too.</li>
    <li> I bought these for camping/backpacking trips.  They are way too fragrant--I kept thinking a bear was going to follow me.  Also they left a sticky residue on my face.</li>
    <li> Having acne and oily skin, my favorite is cucumber, which is refreshing. This product comes next, good for exfoliating without drying.</li>
    <li> This whipe left my face burning and really red. I&#x27;m not aure if that&#x27;s what a brightening facial is suppose to feel. But it smells so good, sad that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the great reviews I&#x27;ve read here. I used 2 cloths last night to remove my makeup and clean my face before bed. Immediately after I finished, I noticed my face was burning and really hot to touch. Then looked in the mirror to find that my face was bright red. I got up this morning to get ready and noticed my face was still bright red. I applied my usual face moisturizer and makeup and still my face is bright red. It&#x27;s now 12pm and STILL my face feels hot to touch and is bright red!!! Horrible, horrible product. I wouldn&#x27;t refer these to anyone. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> These are ok - these are the third kind of Yes To towelettes I&#x27;ve tried. They smell good and leave your face feeling clean. I have been using them to take off my makeup, but apparently they&#x27;re not supposed to be used for that. They don&#x27;t burn my eyes or anything when I use them. I&#x27;ll use them up, but to be honest, the Yes To Blueberry towelettes are my favorite.</li>
    <li> This product contains glycerin as do most of the Yes To... products. This is a real shame, because glycerin is acne-genic for many people. Not only is it sticky and clogs the pores, it is also a sugar....something that bacteria on the face thrive on. So, if you are acne prone, I would say avoid these products and any product containing glycerin. I tried these towelettes, hoping for a good result, but although they cleansed my BB cream off my face well, I broke out 24 hours after using them. Since I rarely break out anymore, and only if I use products containing glycerin, I am going to have to attribute the breakouts to this product</li>
    <li> I like towelette because they are good at home and good for travel.  In addition these have natural ingredients which I prefer.</li>
    <li> The best part is the packaging. The plastic lid and the sticker underneath keep the towelettes from drying out. I first opened mine about 3 weeks ago and the towelettes are still moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product stings my face every time I use it. The cloth is average, not too thin, not too thick. Also not as soft as Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s towelettes. It&#x27;s lightly textured on both sides for manual exfoliation. The texture of the cloth doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really hate is the cleanser aspect. As soon as I use it, my face feels warm, gets red, and stings. It&#x27;s too harsh for my sensitive skin, and it dries out my combination skin. My skin feels parched after I use it, even my oily t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see how it brightens but that might be because I don&#x27;t use it often. I&#x27;ll probably use up the product on my body because I dislike using it on my face.</li>
    <li> Make sure and rinse after use. If you have sensitive skin, PASS! It&#x27;s quite abrasive for a towelette. Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize or this will leave your face feeling like it&#x27;s going to crack.</li>
    <li> I prefer to use this in the morning because it cleans my face as expected and there&#x27;s no eye make up to get off. Do NOT use this to get rid of eye make up. There are acids in it that will sting and well, that&#x27;s in the directions. Brightens my skin nicely and feels like it tightens it too. Smells great and also has large enough wipes for using elsewhere on the body if desired (back, chest, neck etc). Over all I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Not too harsh for my sensitive skin like other cleansing wipes, but still strong enough to get the job done. My skin is the best it&#x27;s been in years. Love the mild exfoliation as well.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, but can be very &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;. I usually have to rinse afterwards because it leaves a soapy-sticky texture, so I&#x27;ve never had it become irritating.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that his will lighten my facial skin, but it does feel clean when I use them. I think that they are a little pricey for what you are getting. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> it can be really irritating, I used 3 times and 2 of them my face went red and irritated, I may use it for my back because I don&#x27;t want to waste it, but I won&#x27;t be using it on my face...</li>
    <li> I am a total skincare-aholic...always trying the latest and greatest new products.  I purchased these at Target because they were on clearance and used them every night as a quick way to wash my face when I was feeling too lazy to use my Clairsonic.  After a few weeks, I started to notice that my skin was significantly brighter and my friends/family were asking what I was doing differently.  At first I was clueless because I hadn&#x27;t changed any of my skin products and had stopped using my prescription retin-A due to pregnancy/breastfeeding.  Alas, I realized what was different...it was the Yes to Grapefruit towelettes.  These really work and don&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(BTW: I am 42 years old with normal skin.)</li>
    <li> I really like these to use at night. I do add cleansing cream after I rinse them and prefer these over wash cloths. Will continue to use</li>
    <li> They have a nice fragrance, but they make my face burn.  I prefer the cucumber face towels by the same company.</li>
    <li> These are typically used for removing makeup, - they do a good job of keeping my face clean to prevent the breakout of localized acne around my nose.</li>
    <li> I really like these wipes.  They&#x27;re natural and cruelty free.  They are the perfect size to fit in my gym bag and are great for freshening up after a workout&lt;br /&gt;when you don&#x27;t have time for a shower. The only drawback is they are not very good at removing mascara.</li>
    <li> This product clears makeup off my face great while preventing more breakouts. It helps current breakouts go away much faster as well. I have very sensitive skin, so I am a fan. I tear the cloths in half and get two uses out of one. One goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Leaves your face feeling super fresh!</li>
    <li> Yes to Grapefruit is a great way to freshen-up, especially when you cannot stop and remove all makeup and start all over again in the middle of a busy day.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love how these cloths feel on my face and the refreshing grapefruit scent.  I am going to make sure I carry these in my bag.  I have really liked all the YES TO products I have used.</li>
    <li> The clothes in this are super strong and very soft. The smell is amazing and refreshing. It gets my makeup off wonderfully and I have even used it on my mascara. My skin is also visibly brighter.&lt;br /&gt;The company is truly cruelty-free and mostly natural as well.</li>
    <li> Has already made a difference in the brightness and clarity of my skin. Great compliment to my vitamin c treatment.  Been using it for three weeks.</li>
    <li> Love these wipes.  They are gentle exfoliating wipes and do not irritate&lt;br /&gt;my dry sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter. She loves them. They seem to do the job of preventing zits.</li>
    <li> First of all, these wipes are not meant for everyday use. The package recommends 1-2/week. If you are using it everyday and feel like its too harsh...that&#x27;s because it is. Secondly, these wipes are not makeup removing wipes. Sure they might work for that but they are meant to be a brightening cleansing wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do like these wipes. I use them twice a week in the morning and feel like they do a good job of making my face feel cleaner. I have only been using them a few weeks but I have yet to really notice a difference in \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; but I still like them. They do make my face a little tingly but not burning. I have fairly sensitive skin but so far so good. I do rinse my face with cold water after I use these because they do leave a little bit of a residue. And yes, they do have a weird smell...it&#x27;s grapefruity but in a weird not so great way. I have kind of gotten used to the smell but could definitely be better!&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, definitely not for everyday use! My face would not be happy with me if I did!! But overall I like them.</li>
    <li> I love these.  I have bought them multiple times.  I have had trouble with adult acne for some time.  Over the summer, I started a routine using products in this line, and my acne has been greatly reduced.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it</li>
    <li> Smell good and work well</li>
    <li> Does a great job of removing makeup from my face.  I like that  this is healthy and free of nasty ingredients.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and i like to clean my face at night with them when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face.</li>
    <li> They smell great and my face feels so refreshed after using them.</li>
    <li> Smells great and takes off most of my make up, but it does sting my eyes.</li>
    <li> These wipes smell amazing and make my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for removing makeup or just a quick refresher.There is a bit of a sting if you put it on broken skin, but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; aspect of it. It really does help in evening out the scar/discoloration on my face. Since I have been using this (and the rest of the line) my boyfriend said my skin was glowing.</li>
    <li> Generous in size and did a great job even with mascara.  Thought I&#x27;d love the grapefruit aroma but wasn&#x27;t crazy about it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, but these agree with me!! I love how fresh and clean my face feels after using them. So convenient and the best price out there!</li>
    <li> Smell is nice but the cloths dry out way too quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I can see a difference in my skin after only 2 months.</li>
    <li> I use this occasional. I haven&#x27;t notice any improvement on my skin. It did not have any breakouts after using the product</li>
    <li> While it does remove eye make-up (liquid eyeliner, pencil eyeliner, mascara) very well, the residue from the towelette stayed on my lashes and stung my eyes. Sensitivity to the product? Maybe, IDK but it was painful!</li>
    <li> work well, refreshing</li>
    <li> Love that one side is textured. Removes my make-up, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like these wipes.  They made my skin red and stung a little when I used them.  I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34; products and this is the first one I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> These have a strange smell to them but they work AMAZING!!! They leave my skin so soft after just one use!! I have really sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I think these do the job for which they are intended.  Unfortunately for me, I have sensitive skin due to environmental issues (pollution, allergens, poor water quality).  So these do not help me.</li>
    <li> This does make my face appear brighter the very first time I used it, but that was it. Does nothing else. Will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Have been using these a few months and absolutely love them. They clean so well and brighten my skin as well as tighten. A must have item!</li>
    <li> Stings a little, but does the job well and does not make me break out.</li>
    <li> This works beautifully with the other Yes Products. It removes makeup and is wonderful to use in the morning or after a long workout!</li>
    <li> I admit my skin does have a nice glow about it after using one of these towelettes but sometimes I feel it stings a little which may be due to having really sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t use them super often, mostly as a refresher when I can&#x27;t just go wash my face and always apply a touch of moisturizer afterwards.  They do take makeup off well even though they aren&#x27;t technically made for that but they can sting around the eyes so I suggest buying real makeup wipes for your eyes.  The price is right, cheaper than my local box stores and I get them monthly with subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite skin brighteners. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and have seen a significant reduction in acne scars and lightening of freckles. I use them post workout and before bed, and they keep acne from occurring well, too. The scent is pleasant, though a little medicinal. It does exactly what it said it would do for my skin and complexion. A lot of stupid people keep rating this line of products down because they don&#x27;t remove makeup. Don&#x27;t be ignorant. The description makes it clear that they&#x27;re designed for SKIN, not makeup removal, but whatever. I can&#x27;t expect everyone to read the description, but at least you&#x27;ve made it to the reviews. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wife of the house chiming in, I love these. My skin feels so refreshed. I actually look forward to using them and the scent is great. Will buy regularly.</li>
    <li> I have normal skin and this doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s a film left behind like with the Neutrogena, the Clean &amp; Clear or Pond&#x27;s face wipes. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. Would buy again. I usually use it right after the gym, so my face is usually alrighty brightened from working out.</li>
    <li> Love these for midday and at night before bed, great for travel and feel so good. Will be gathering these up for me and family. What a great refresher. Love the way it wakes my face up and so soft.</li>
    <li> My favorite towelettes. Wonderful subtle grapefruit scent, easy to remove from bag, opening easy to reseal, and best of all - not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> Sometimes we get excited about facial care products, and fail to follow instructions. These wipes are potent, and there are only 25 ct. for a very good reason: they work. The package says use 1-2 times a week or as needed. You won&#x27;t need it more than 2 times a week, and honestly I have reduced use to once per week. I initially was scrubbing my face with these wipes probably 3-5 times per week before I realized my skin was peeling and burning and I got a lot of cysts. Basically a lot of pimples were &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; from my face due to the exfoliation, and I had inflammation from exfoliating too much which led to cysts. The cysts probably come because when your skin is inflammed it is more likely to get infected in the pores that exposed. Once I cut back use my skin was able to heal and I started using once a week. I don&#x27;t scrub when I use it now, just wipe my face all over and let it dry before using moisturizer and powder foundation. Your skin looks greasy after use because of the residue but it will evaporate/dry off in a few moments. I have noticed newer blemishes are less likely to leave brown marks while using these wipes, but no dramatic brightening effects just yet after about 3 weeks or so.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way these wipes smell- very light, citrus, yummy! Sorry, but that&#x27;s how it feels lol. They make washing my face more enjoyable, and my face feels clean afterward.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure that I saw much difference in the brightening aspect, but I also only used these for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t like them enough to buy them again. I just really like trying different products.&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely one of my favorites though.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them, and would definitely purchase them again!</li>
    <li> These are so useful for when you are traveling.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product really won me over. Plus my face always felt amazing after the use. Great product. Although a little more than I wanted to pay. Good product overall</li>
    <li> I cannot use these. The cloth burned my face and caused a lot of redness. It&#x27;s to much for my skin. I use the Biore brand of Cleansing cloths. Those I&#x27;ve never had a problem with.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me. I do however love the Blueberry wipes from the same brand. I get lots of compliments when I use them.</li>
    <li> Great scent, removes 80% of makeup but hard time removing eyeliner and mascara. Haven&#x27;t noticed a &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; change and have used over a year now, but others have said they noticed. Love using before washing face or great for those lazy late nights I don&#x27;t feel like fully washing my face.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, and these wipes turn my face blotchy bright red after use.  I use them at the end of the day, so it is not such a big deal, but I would not use them for day use because of this.  I also rinse my face with cold water after using to help with the itching and redness.  I like it because I think they do a decent job getting the oil and dirt off, but they irritate as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of mixed heritage ( Irish ,Mexican , Native American ect. ) so  my fair skin can tan... But I&#x27;m more prone to hyper pigmentation , and I hate skin bleach creams because they make you look like Casper  and the ingredients over time  can damage your skins ability to make collagen ,pigment  etcetera ... So  I love this line because its natural; genteel enough to use every day. ( my spots ARE fading)  but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin raw so I can go outside and get  some color, not too much though I also bought. The  yes to grapefruit. Sunscreen. Love it all  :)</li>
