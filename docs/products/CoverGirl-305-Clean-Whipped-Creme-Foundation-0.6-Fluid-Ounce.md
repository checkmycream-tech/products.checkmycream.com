### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My wife was very happy with the service.</li>
      <li>no melting and the flawless coverage is what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>and I feel this is perfect for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>By no means am I going to promote it as \\&quot;the best foundation</li>
      <li>Best.</li>
      <li>I wore this foundation during the days when the weather was in the 100s and went to the dog park for two hours in the sun and then gave my two dogs a bath then showered without washing my face or hair, and by the end of the day my makeup still looked great, even without wearing any primer!</li>
      <li>Two in one is the best!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find a word to express how much I love it!!!</li>
      <li>It has very good coverage.</li>
      <li>This foundation doesn&#x27;t provide very good coverage in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The color was perfect for my skin tone and the texture of it is great.</li>
      <li>shipping and good price!</li>
      <li>It sits great under powder &amp; doesn&#x27;t cake after reapplication even on sweat...</li>
      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>It also works great as a concealer.</li>
      <li>Its great.</li>
      <li>Great coverage foundation.</li>
      <li>( Hoping they&#x27;ll change their minds and make more!!</li>
      <li>So I reapplied and it was AMAZING!</li>
      <li>amazing!</li>
      <li>This is the best makeup  so smooth and covers great</li>
      <li>Good coverage without looking cakey.</li>
      <li>Again…here is another good product that appears has been discontinued.  </li>
      <li>I just picked up this foundation and have been using it for two weeks now, and I can honestly say I am super impressed.</li>
      <li>It has a great whipped consistency that smooths over my skin nicely and masks most imperfections.</li>
      <li>I love this foundation!</li>
      <li>Glad I kept the receipt!</li>
      <li>Simply amazing.</li>
      <li>Great color, applies smoothly.</li>
      <li>Nice coverage too</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a shame.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really lightweight and perfect.</li>
      <li>This by far is the best whipped foundation I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell which is a nice improvement over older CoverGirl foundation!!  </li>
      <li>Very light and not greasy.</li>
      <li>After applying in the morning, I find that most of it has rubbed off by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t have spf, do I have to wear under &amp; with a powder on top.</li>
      <li>Most foundations I have tried disappoint when it comes to coverage and color match</li>
      <li>It conceals better than my $100 Dermablend, Clinique, Merle Norman, etc.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I do have hyperpigmentation problem areas on the top of my forehead and chin that could be seen by the end of the day, but I feel that was from transferring to a napkin, my hand, a kleenex, etc.</li>
      <li>thank you CG because nothing screams pores and lines more than shine.</li>
      <li>I love the stuff.</li>
      <li>and I love the creamy feel of the product.  </li>
      <li>My favorite foundation.</li>
      <li>It was as if it had all settled at the top of the foundation.</li>
      <li>I found it on Amazon and have ordered more to keep my supply up.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this must be attributable to the product being &#x27;breathable.&#x27;</li>
      <li>My skin is fair, red-tinted from years of aggravation, full of pockmarks from acne scars, and fine lines are beginning to appear.</li>
      <li>Covergirl clean glow blush in peach looks really nice paired with this foundation.</li>
      <li>I love the smooth texture.</li>
      <li>I have combo skin that dries out relatively easily.</li>
      <li>While it does stay moist and easily transfers to clothes, hands, etc.</li>
      <li>It feels luxurious when applying, requires very little for even, smooth coverage, and with a light dusting of powder over the top, provides absolutely flawless, pretty complexion that looks as good at 9pm as it did at 5am.</li>
      <li>This Foundation is my absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a huge bonus while traveling.</li>
      <li>I just wish the coverage wasn&#x27;t so light because I can see my freckles</li>
      <li>I hope cover girl reconsiders and brings it back, as the coverage is great.</li>
      <li>I used a cheap sponge and dabbed it on my cheeks, forehead, and chin before I rubbed it in.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted with quick delivery !!</li>
      <li>Love this foundation so much!</li>
      <li>but I can honestly say I love it more than other foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>This foundation is completely weightless on my skin, but it has great coverage that you can build up as much as you need to without feeling cakey.</li>
      <li>I like this makeup because it is very creamy and leaves a very smooth finish on my face.  </li>
      <li>Recommended who love CoverGirl or want to try something new on foundation!!</li>
      <li>It feels great on my skin and even has a nice subtle smell.</li>
      <li>I just use a makeup brush over my blemishes and it looks nice and natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super shiny when I get home from classes.</li>
      <li>and I cannot believe how beautifully this product covers, without being heavy, oily, or clogging pores.</li>
      <li>My skin is very prone to breakouts but this stuff doesn&#x27;t make me break out!!</li>
      <li>I was excited about trying this product since several magazines mentioned it as having great texture &amp; finish, especially for a low-priced line.  </li>
      <li>but it has great coverage that you can build up as much as you need to without feeling heavy or cakey.</li>
      <li>But this foundation works pretty well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s full coverage, yet is light enough to not clog pores and it allows your skin to breathe.</li>
      <li>I was unsure at first because I had never ordered make up online before.</li>
      <li>By no means does it \\&quot;erase\\&quot; the imperfections on my skin, but it does cover them better than similar products and evens out my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I think it handles my shiny skin pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I purchased my first jar of this in June after watching some YouTube videos on creating a contoured look.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;t works pretty good for getting rid of under eye circles and for minimizing the red appearance of a scar I have above my eyebrow.</li>
      <li>Thanks very much</li>
      <li>And at first, it seemed to be a real find.  </li>
      <li>From a distance and in the right lighting, my skin almost looks normal, and not like a cratered moonscape.</li>
      <li>This stuff feels great and smooth and all, but, after about 10 minutes, it sets and gives a bit of a cakey appearance, even if I use primer underneath and even if I only use a tiny little bit.</li>
      <li>Now, just five days into wearing it, ,u whole chin is breaking out-</li>
      <li>I am not putting anything with the word \\&quot;clean\\&quot; in it with that much oil on my face.</li>
      <li>You only need a tiny bit and it smooths on so nicely.  </li>
      <li>I loved it so much, I went back to the same drugstore and bought several more jars in the different &#x27;seasonal&#x27; shades</li>
      <li>It last long and smooth!!</li>
      <li>The classic ivory seems to blend pretty well with my natural skin color and reduces the redness.</li>
      <li>and I need something that doesn&#x27;t make me look ever older.</li>
      <li>&quot; But I would recommend it if you want a decent foundation for a decent price.</li>
      <li>It is rare that I buy any foundation twice, but yesterday I purchased this product for the second time.</li>
      <li>Like another reviewer on here, I buy a different foundation pretty much every time I buy foundation.  </li>
      <li>I love it, you get the right  amount every time, nothing wasted because you could not get it back in a bottle.  </li>
      <li>like you see in all new makeup products because mine had none</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely going back to Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Smooth Mousse.</li>
      <li>Mind you, I am comparing this product to foundations I have tried from similar brands you&#x27;d find in department stores, and not expensive beauty products.</li>
      <li>This is smooth, lite and creamy and seems to work down here in florida.</li>
      <li>It just leaves a heavy appearance, but it feels SO light.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted with quick delivery !!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !</li>
    <li> I purchased some of this from a department store to try. I have rosacea and insanely delicate skin. I have an extremely difficult time finding any product to use on my face that won&#x27;t cause inflammation, pain, and breakouts. Serious breakouts constantly! It&#x27;s a pain in the butt... I have to say that I&#x27;ve been going back as forth between this and the Garnier 3-1 stuff. I&#x27;d prefer this, since it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts as badly as the other. I was so super disappointed to hit up all the stores in town and not find any! :0( Hoping they&#x27;ll change their minds and make more!!</li>
    <li> When I found out this product was discontinued, I panicked. Fortunately, I found a few jars, which should last at least a few years. I hope cover girl reconsiders and brings it back, as the coverage is great. Very light and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Great coverage foundation. I love the smooth texture.</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation. I can put on just a little to cover the dark circles and red spot on my face or I can cover my whole face. It&#x27;s really lightweight and perfect.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Love this product. Thanks very much</li>
    <li> I love this foundation! My skin is very prone to breakouts but this stuff doesn&#x27;t make me break out!! It covers even my dark circles and goes on super sheer.</li>
    <li> It is rare that I buy any foundation twice, but yesterday I purchased this product for the second time. Most foundations I have tried disappoint when it comes to coverage and color match so I&#x27;m always jumping from one product to the next. Mind you, I am comparing this product to foundations I have tried from similar brands you&#x27;d find in department stores, and not expensive beauty products. By no means am I going to promote it as \\&quot;the best foundation ever,\\&quot; But I would recommend it if you want a decent foundation for a decent price. My skin is fair, red-tinted from years of aggravation, full of pockmarks from acne scars, and fine lines are beginning to appear. This foundation goes on thick and creamy without feeling heavy. By no means does it \\&quot;erase\\&quot; the imperfections on my skin, but it does cover them better than similar products and evens out my skin tone. The classic ivory seems to blend pretty well with my natural skin color and reduces the redness. Covergirl clean glow blush in peach looks really nice paired with this foundation. From a distance and in the right lighting, my skin almost looks normal, and not like a cratered moonscape.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have a hard time finding foundation that doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse than it already it. But this foundation works pretty well. It has a great whipped consistency that smooths over my skin nicely and masks most imperfections. It has a pleasant smell which is a nice improvement over older CoverGirl foundation!!  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day. After applying in the morning, I find that most of it has rubbed off by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This Foundation is my absolute favorite! I was unsure at first because I had never ordered make up online before. The first time I applied it I had used to much at one time and because where its a whipped crème it was really thick. So I reapplied and it was AMAZING! it covered all of my little blemishes and looked natural. I used a cheap sponge and dabbed it on my cheeks, forehead, and chin before I rubbed it in. So if you&#x27;re like me and get small breakouts then this is the foundation for you!</li>
    <li> Wish this stuff hadnt been discontinued in stores. Its great.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup  so smooth and covers great</li>
    <li> went to drug store and tested this out. I opened a can of this a bit and all this oil...grease? started dripping out. It was as if it had all settled at the top of the foundation. I am not putting anything with the word \\&quot;clean\\&quot; in it with that much oil on my face. I showed my mom..it was disgusting. it felt very slick and didn&#x27;t come off until I had just rubbed it completely into my hands. Just buyer beware</li>
    <li> I just received my foundation!! I can&#x27;t find a word to express how much I love it!!! It last long and smooth!! It does its job to cover well for the dots or acne etc.&lt;br /&gt;Love the feeling when I put on my face!! It&#x27;s not dry nor oily, I have normal skin and I feel this is perfect for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I think I will stay with this one as so on!! Recommended who love CoverGirl or want to try something new on foundation!!</li>
    <li> I was excited about trying this product since several magazines mentioned it as having great texture &amp; finish, especially for a low-priced line.  And at first, it seemed to be a real find.  Now, just five days into wearing it, ,u whole chin is breaking out- and I&#x27;m fifty!  Ugh.  No thanks, going back to Target where I bought it.  Glad I kept the receipt!</li>
    <li> I bought this from a drugstore because I&#x27;m in between foundations. I wanted to maybe try something other than my Bare Minerals, but I&#x27;ll definitely be going back to Bare Minerals because the few products I&#x27;ve tried have absolutely sucked. This is one of those times that I remember why I don&#x27;t wear liquid makeup anymore.    I have combo skin that dries out relatively easily. I have some acne scarring (not much) on my cheeks from when I was a teenager and I have a little bit of redness when I wake up in the mornings. This stuff feels great and smooth and all, but, after about 10 minutes, it sets and gives a bit of a cakey appearance, even if I use primer underneath and even if I only use a tiny little bit. It seems to settle into lines too. The only real use for this that I currently have is to cover up my under eye dark circles because, when I wear this as a supposedly \\&quot;light\\&quot; foundation, it definitely looks like I&#x27;m wearing makeup. It just doesn&#x27;t have a natural appearance on me for whatever reason. I will use this whenever I have particularly bad under eye dark circles as a bit of a boost, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have wrinkles under your eyes because it WILL settle into your fine lines. I have used it as a full face foundation for a couple of days while running errands because I thought that maybe I was doing something wrong when applying it (I have used my fingers, a brush and a sponge all on different occasions), but I guess not. It just leaves a heavy appearance, but it feels SO light. It&#x27;s kind of a shame. Oh well. I have also noticed that, when I go to take the makeup off for the night, it leaves my skin red and my skin has a bit of a burning sensation like there&#x27;s something in this that is making my skin react. Kind of weird. The redness and burning goes away upon waking up in the morning, but I almost think I&#x27;m reacting to something in the product. And, did I mention that this will leave you feeling greasy a few hours after wearing it? YUCK. I&#x27;m super shiny when I get home from classes. I don&#x27;t typically use any sort of powder, but I feel like a powder is a must if you&#x27;re going to use this as a basic foundation. Wearing Smashbox primer underneath just seems to make the shine worse by the end of the day. Not good! I&#x27;t works pretty good for getting rid of under eye circles and for minimizing the red appearance of a scar I have above my eyebrow. I&#x27;ll continue using this, but only in combination with my mineral makeup...</li>
    <li> Days prior to purchasing this, I returned$130 of Georgio Armani, sampled dior, Lancôme, clinique&amp; finally ran out of steam dragging my toddler to these mskeup counters. This doesn&#x27;t have spf, do I have to wear under &amp; with a powder on top. But it was the only foundation that didn&#x27;t patch or slide in the heat at work &amp; I sampled at least a dozen. I was also afraid of clogged pores because its essentially something one. But the texture &amp; coverage is light &amp; it has a matte finish or at least a natural non dewy, mom shiny, non radiant finish...thank you CG because nothing screams pores and lines more than shine. It sits great under powder &amp; doesn&#x27;t cake after reapplication even on sweat...amazing! I just wish the coverage wasn&#x27;t so light because I can see my freckles</li>
    <li> When any of y&#x27;all received this item was there plastic on it like you see in all new makeup products because mine had none &amp; I&#x27;m kinda freaked out.</li>
    <li> Again…here is another good product that appears has been discontinued.  I found it on Amazon and have ordered more to keep my supply up.  I like this makeup because it is very creamy and leaves a very smooth finish on my face.  It has very good coverage.</li>
    <li> Great color, applies smoothly. The only foundation I use.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00D2NUUO8 COVERGIRL Clean Whipped Creme Foundation Creamy Beige 350, 0.6 Fl Oz]]Very disappointed! This product definitely opened and used. There was no seal inside or outside on the jar and there was residue on the lid. This type of product can carry bacteria so I couldn&#x27;t use it and out my money.</li>
    <li> Love this foundation so much! The color was perfect for my skin tone and the texture of it is great. Good coverage without looking cakey. It feels great on my skin and even has a nice subtle smell.</li>
    <li> Just what we were looking but couldn&#x27;t find at our local drugstores.</li>
    <li> Best. Foundation. Ever. I&#x27;ll admit I am a cosmetics snob and bought this product purely out of desperation when I was extended overseas and out of my usual overpriced department store brand. I loved it so much, I went back to the same drugstore and bought several more jars in the different &#x27;seasonal&#x27; shades I thought I might need. I have only recently switched from powder foundation to the creamier version and I cannot believe how beautifully this product covers, without being heavy, oily, or clogging pores. I&#x27;ve even done the unspeakable and have gone to bed a few times without washing my face (shhhhh....) and fully expected terrible things in the day(s) to follow. I&#x27;m sure this must be attributable to the product being &#x27;breathable.&#x27; It feels luxurious when applying, requires very little for even, smooth coverage, and with a light dusting of powder over the top, provides absolutely flawless, pretty complexion that looks as good at 9pm as it did at 5am. Simply amazing. I&#x27;m heartsick that it&#x27;s being discontinued......</li>
    <li> Why does every darn foundation, undereye concealer, eye gels, pencils and shampoos contain this ingredient? It is an eye irritant, acne causing and makes my eyes water non stop. I am sick of cyclops and wish it was banned.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I had looked in over 4 stores locally and they do not carry the CoverGirl Whipped Cream Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Fsst shipping and good price!</li>
    <li> I purchased my first jar of this in June after watching some YouTube videos on creating a contoured look. I didn&#x27;t want to buy the super expensive stuff and it not work. I had middle of the road expectations for this foundation because it was CoverGirl, and it said whipped causing me to worry about coverage. I have SLE Lupus and have the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; (malar) rash on my face. This is redness that is hard to conceal. This foundation is completely weightless on my skin, but it has great coverage that you can build up as much as you need to without feeling cakey. Living in Texas, I also need something that won&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; off my face throughout the day. While it does stay moist and easily transfers to clothes, hands, etc. no melting and the flawless coverage is what I was looking for. It conceals better than my $100 Dermablend, Clinique, Merle Norman, etc. products. I do have hyperpigmentation problem areas on the top of my forehead and chin that could be seen by the end of the day, but I feel that was from transferring to a napkin, my hand, a kleenex, etc. Overall, this is the only coverage I have found for my &amp;#34;lupus face&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I just picked up this foundation and have been using it for two weeks now, and I can honestly say I am super impressed. I had super low expectations for this foundation because of all the bad reviews but I can honestly say I love it more than other foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried. I am a complete makeup junkie and just got this product for a review. I have dry skin with not much acne just dark spots and white heads. I can say this foundation is completely weightless on my skin but it has great coverage that you can build up as much as you need to without feeling heavy or cakey. I wore this foundation during the days when the weather was in the 100s and went to the dog park for two hours in the sun and then gave my two dogs a bath then showered without washing my face or hair, and by the end of the day my makeup still looked great, even without wearing any primer! The only thing was at the end of that day there was minor fading on my chin and slight creasing under my eyes, but for a foundation in the conditions I wore it in without primer that&#x27;s terrific! It doesn&#x27;t cling to dry patches or hair either. Out of 5 I give this foundation 4.9!</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer on here, I buy a different foundation pretty much every time I buy foundation.  This one, however, I think I will stick with.  You only need a tiny bit and it smooths on so nicely.  I think it handles my shiny skin pretty well.  I do have to dab on a little powder to set it.</li>
    <li> This foundation doesn&#x27;t provide very good coverage in my opinion. I also don&#x27;t care for the way it looks on my skin, the \\&quot;finish\\&quot; isn&#x27;t natural looking at all. I&#x27;m definitely going back to Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Smooth Mousse.</li>
    <li> I love it, you get the right  amount every time, nothing wasted because you could not get it back in a bottle.  Nice coverage too and I love the creamy feel of the product.  I just wish they would keep it on the market, really difficult to find any jars of the Whipped Creme Foundation.</li>
    <li> I am 41 and I need something that doesn&#x27;t make me look ever older. This is smooth, lite and creamy and seems to work down here in florida. I love the stuff. It also works great as a concealer. I just use a makeup brush over my blemishes and it looks nice and natural. That&#x27;s a huge bonus while traveling. Two in one is the best!</li>
    <li> This by far is the best whipped foundation I&#x27;ve ever come across. It&#x27;s full coverage, yet is light enough to not clog pores and it allows your skin to breathe. I always get compliments whenever I use this foundation.</li>
    <li> My wife was very happy with the service.</li>
