    <li> BIOLAGE GELEE WORKS THE BEST OUT OF ALL THE HAIR CARE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE!!</li>
    <li> Have used this product when found my wife had for her hair.  Keeps my hiar from standing out like Porcupine.</li>
    <li> I have used this gel for about 20 years now.  Great for naturally curly hair. It helps define the curl and you can decide how much curl or body you would like to have with this gel.  Leaves no build-up it rinses clean with just water.  You can&#x27;t find many gels that do that.  Only downfall is the price and the fact it doesn&#x27;t come in a gallon.</li>
    <li> Thank you Matrix for the quick service and great packaging of this product.  Everything was received as I expected to get it.</li>

    <li> I have ong hair and it has a frizz and anoying wave ...however, just a small amount of this gelee on the ends and scrunching the ends while my head is upside down, those frizzy waves becomes soft, beautiful waves.
