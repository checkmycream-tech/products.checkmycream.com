### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Product is great!!</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>This Fiber Gum is perfect, creates great shape and texture that lasts (note:</li>
      <li>telling her how great it is,</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>Although it smells nice, it does not have very good hold at all</li>
      <li>Really good hold on styling hair</li>
      <li>Now third-party sellers are trying to sell this for 4 times (or more!)</li>
      <li>My favorite hair goo.</li>
      <li>My favorite hair styling product ever bought.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it does what it supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, wish I could get more at a better price like it</li>
      <li>i love this fibergum  putty</li>
      <li>Great for if you&#x27;re just trying to keep the friz down, like I need, and great for going out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a nice bit of hold, and is helpful as a last-minute fix, like when you&#x27;re on the way out the door and need a quick dollop of hold.</li>
      <li>new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something that had a strong hold, however, the product has the consistency of yogurt.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied customer, thanks.</li>
      <li>Great short hair styler for a defined wet/dry look,</li>
      <li>This is great for my short hair.  </li>
      <li>That gives my hair a smooth, shiny finish that says put.  </li>
      <li>it smells good and is soft on the hair when puttiit in  i wont say it has a super hold  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s original retail price.  </li>
      <li>However, for the moment [[ASIN:B007KA804Q Got2b Chaotic Fiber Gum, 2.0 Ounce]] is my substitute product - much thicker than the Garnier product, but does an OK job once I get it on my hair.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff, especially for paying something like $3 in a grocery/drug store for it.</li>
      <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s my new favorite thing.  </li>
      <li>: I have not found the perfect replacement yet - kind of amazing that Garnier has not noticed the pleas for this product to return and the terrible reviews fir the replacement products.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I can still get it on  Amazon.com since it is no longer available in local stores.</li>
      <li>and this is a nice fix, and I only need a dime-size amount.</li>
      <li>I have to use a lot, probably more than it recommends, but wow my hair goes right where I want it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great product for rocketing otherwise plain hair into really fun, kicky style.</li>
      <li>I knew that higher-priced salon products would definitely work, but I wanted to see if I could find something in the drugstore that would do the trick while being more accessible.  </li>
      <li>Keeps it in place and going in the right direction.</li>
      <li>I have used the product several times in different types of weather situations, and I am really happy with it.  </li>
      <li>super sticky dont use it as much</li>
      <li>Used to be a great product, but for some unknown reason discontinued by Garnier and replaced with far inferior products.  </li>
      <li>First off, there was no seal on the item</li>
      <li>It should be a little more concentrated for a strong hold.</li>
      <li>This is the only product I have tried that gives fullness and body to my fine hair.</li>
      <li>but then I figured I&#x27;m so enchanted with it that she would think it&#x27;s spam and not believe it was a real email.  </li>
      <li>I was really ha an allergic reaction to this......made me itch on scalp and</li>
      <li>I know, too much drama, but this stuff really is an answer to prayer.  </li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>I perm my hair curly and drive a convertible with the top down always.  </li>
      <li>one of my favorite products, works better and costs a fraction of expensive salon products.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
      <li>i had to buy it here as i was almost out and none of the stores i normally would have gotten it at  carried it.</li>
      <li>I always have a few shorties on the top of my head and around my face that don&#x27;t want to behave.  </li>
      <li>I have slightly wavy hair that tends to have a mind of its own, especially in humid or windy weather.  </li>
      <li>i would say this is for boys or men trying to do something new to there hair</li>
      <li>I have fine limp hair, and it gives me the body and volume I need.</li>
      <li>even my face.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I needed a hair product that would shape and hold my hair without stiffness, emphasizing the natural style of the hair while holding it in place.  </li>
      <li>Especially good for coarse, thick hair as even a dime-sized amount would probably weigh down thin or fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This product if allowed to dry before I leave with the top down, holds and maintains the curls I scrunch in with the putty.  </li>
      <li>Apparently Garnier discontinued this.</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s been the only hair product that worked for me.</li>
      <li>I use a little hair oil first for shine (Moroccan Oil or Agadir Oil), then use the Fiber Gum to create choppy waves on top, slicked sides, and pointy little bangs and sideburns.  </li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate).  </li>
      <li>I have short, straight hair, fine but lots of it, so heavy and hard to control.  </li>
      <li>i have super thick hair and curly</li>
      <li>I just run my fingers through it lightly to break it up a little for the wet-dry effect,and it still holds, add a little back in here and there for extra definition if I need it.  </li>

<li> I just run my fingers through it lightly to break it up a little for the wet-dry effect,and it still holds, add a little back in here and there for extra definition if I need it.  </li>
<li> often, I run a tiny bit of this through my bangs after they go through the flat iron.  </li>
<li> I also use this on my ends sometimes, if I want less fluffy and more piecey texture - but very small sections at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It stays as it should all day long.  </li>
<li> I suppose it works well with your natural hair type, so if you like your hair type there won&#x27;t be any problems; however, if you put hard work into curling or straightening your hair, this product is likely to ruin everything you work for, so I do NOT recommend it.</li>
<li> I dry my hair, then use the putty to shape it how I want...</li>
<li> Applied it and followed the instructions to blow dry.</li>
<li> It feels soft to the touch, which for me usually means it doesn&#x27;t hold, but it does, I have no idea</li>
<li> I barely dip my finger into the product and smear a thin layer between my thumb and finger and slide it over the bad hair, and I&#x27;m good to go all day.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money and tried almost everything before discovering this.</li>
<li> I took a small dollop of this product, applied it, and almost instantly, my hair curled and 30 minutes of hard work was completely ruined!</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it was actually</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really hard to control, so at one point I cut it really short.  </li>
<li> Dark blond going gray, and I like the gray, want to emphasize it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had my jar forever, as I rotate this with a few other garnier hair products according to mood, humidity, hair style, etc.</li>
<li> Yes, it dries a little hard, but once dry</li>
<li> I spritz a little spray.  </li>
<li> I have used this product for years but am very disappointed the company (Garnier) changed to Fiber Spikes, it&#x27;s the same product but a much smaller quantity and more expensive.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or gunky in my hair, but I&#x27;m used to wearing a lot of product to keep things under control, so</li>
<li> Since then I have been unable to grow it out because it gets to a stage where it&#x27;s totally unmanageable, nothing holds it in place, and I just can&#x27;t handle it</li>
<li> I hate to be dramatic...</li>
<li> and you have to use an insane amount of the product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is great for my short hair.  Keeps it in place and going in the right direction.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Please keep carrying it.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product numerous times on straightened hair. I spend from 15 to 30 minutes straightening my hair. I took a small dollop of this product, applied it, and almost instantly, my hair curled and 30 minutes of hard work was completely ruined! I suppose it works well with your natural hair type, so if you like your hair type there won&#x27;t be any problems; however, if you put hard work into curling or straightening your hair, this product is likely to ruin everything you work for, so I do NOT recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have tried that gives fullness and body to my fine hair. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money and tried almost everything before discovering this. I am so glad I can still get it on  Amazon.com since it is no longer available in local stores. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied customer, thanks.</li>
    <li> Great short hair styler for a defined wet/dry look, one of my favorite products, works better and costs a fraction of expensive salon products.  I have short, straight hair, fine but lots of it, so heavy and hard to control.  Dark blond going gray, and I like the gray, want to emphasize it.  This Fiber Gum is perfect, creates great shape and texture that lasts (note: I live in a dry climate).  It darkens my blond hair a bit, which brings out the grays, makes them look silvery and shiny by contrast.  I use a little hair oil first for shine (Moroccan Oil or Agadir Oil), then use the Fiber Gum to create choppy waves on top, slicked sides, and pointy little bangs and sideburns.  Yes, it dries a little hard, but once dry I just run my fingers through it lightly to break it up a little for the wet-dry effect,and it still holds, add a little back in here and there for extra definition if I need it.  Overall it&#x27;s a great product for rocketing otherwise plain hair into really fun, kicky style.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair styling product ever bought. Great for if you&#x27;re just trying to keep the friz down, like I need, and great for going out. Take it with in all trips.</li>
    <li> I perm my hair curly and drive a convertible with the top down always.  This product if allowed to dry before I leave with the top down, holds and maintains the curls I scrunch in with the putty.  I like it!</li>
    <li> Product is great!! But to over priced.</li>
    <li> I always have a few shorties on the top of my head and around my face that don&#x27;t want to behave.  I barely dip my finger into the product and smear a thin layer between my thumb and finger and slide it over the bad hair, and I&#x27;m good to go all day.  I also use this on my ends sometimes, if I want less fluffy and more piecey texture - but very small sections at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most often, I run a tiny bit of this through my bangs after they go through the flat iron.  That gives my hair a smooth, shiny finish that says put.  I really like this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, especially for paying something like $3 in a grocery/drug store for it. It&#x27;s got a nice bit of hold, and is helpful as a last-minute fix, like when you&#x27;re on the way out the door and need a quick dollop of hold. I&#x27;ve had my jar forever, as I rotate this with a few other garnier hair products according to mood, humidity, hair style, etc. I&#x27;ve got wavy longish hair and this is a nice fix, and I only need a dime-size amount.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrific for styling a woman&#x27;s pixie cut or men&#x27;s short hair.  Especially good for coarse, thick hair as even a dime-sized amount would probably weigh down thin or fine hair.  I have used this product for years but am very disappointed the company (Garnier) changed to Fiber Spikes, it&#x27;s the same product but a much smaller quantity and more expensive.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, wish I could get more at a better price like it once was when I used to buy it in stores.</li>
    <li> This putty claims to give you the faux hawk look. Applied it and followed the instructions to blow dry. Ended up like I just got out of bed. Not quite the look I was going for. Tried again without blow drying but to no avail. This doesn&#x27;t give you the spiky/ piecey hair that I was going for. Although it smells nice, it does not have very good hold at all and you have to use an insane amount of the product. Returned it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair goo.</li>
    <li> I have slightly wavy hair that tends to have a mind of its own, especially in humid or windy weather.  I needed a hair product that would shape and hold my hair without stiffness, emphasizing the natural style of the hair while holding it in place.  I knew that higher-priced salon products would definitely work, but I wanted to see if I could find something in the drugstore that would do the trick while being more accessible.  I have used the product several times in different types of weather situations, and I am really happy with it.  It tends to hold my style in place almost an entire day before I need to touch it up.  I debated between Garnier Fructis Fiber Gum Putty, and L&#x27;Oreal Overworked Hair Putty, but since this product does what it sets out to achieve I will continue using this!</li>
    <li> super sticky dont use it as much and i wont i would say this is for boys or men trying to do something new to there hair</li>
    <li> I was really ha an allergic reaction to this......made me itch on scalp and even my face.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Really good hold on styling hair</li>
    <li> I have a LOT of hair (my hair stylist says enough for two heads), and it&#x27;s silky with lots of waves and cowlicks.  It&#x27;s really hard to control, so at one point I cut it really short.  Since then I have been unable to grow it out because it gets to a stage where it&#x27;s totally unmanageable, nothing holds it in place, and I just can&#x27;t handle it so get it cut off again.  I hate to be dramatic...but UNTIL NOW that is!  I know, too much drama, but this stuff really is an answer to prayer.  I dry my hair, then use the putty to shape it how I want...I have to use a lot, probably more than it recommends, but wow my hair goes right where I want it.  I spritz a little spray.  It stays as it should all day long.  It feels soft to the touch, which for me usually means it doesn&#x27;t hold, but it does, I have no idea how.  I&#x27;m truly amazed.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or gunky in my hair, but I&#x27;m used to wearing a lot of product to keep things under control, so maybe I just don&#x27;t notice.  It washes out without residue.  Honestly, it&#x27;s my new favorite thing.  I was going to email my sister telling her how great it is, but then I figured I&#x27;m so enchanted with it that she would think it&#x27;s spam and not believe it was a real email.  I guess I have to wait until I talk to her.... I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> i love this fibergum  putty it smells good and is soft on the hair when puttiit in  i wont say it has a super hold  beacause i have super thick hair and curly it does show youre curls wich i like ,</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does what it supposed to do. i had to buy it here as i was almost out and none of the stores i normally would have gotten it at  carried it.</li>
    <li> First off, there was no seal on the item so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it was actually new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something that had a strong hold, however, the product has the consistency of yogurt. It should be a little more concentrated for a strong hold.</li>
    <li> As advertised, delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Used to be a great product, but for some unknown reason discontinued by Garnier and replaced with far inferior products.  Now third-party sellers are trying to sell this for 4 times (or more!) over it&#x27;s original retail price.  Avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I have not found the perfect replacement yet - kind of amazing that Garnier has not noticed the pleas for this product to return and the terrible reviews fir the replacement products.  However, for the moment [[ASIN:B007KA804Q Got2b Chaotic Fiber Gum, 2.0 Ounce]] is my substitute product - much thicker than the Garnier product, but does an OK job once I get it on my hair.</li>
    <li> Apparently Garnier discontinued this. So far, it&#x27;s been the only hair product that worked for me. I have fine limp hair, and it gives me the body and volume I need.</li>
