    <li> This is a very good product, but does lack the high shine. It goes on smoothly, and just so you know, this is not a long-wear lipstick. Love the color.</li>
    <li> I purchased a new Madeline lipstick (mauve luscious) and was disappointed to find that it arrived unsealed.  It appeared used when it should have been new.  I threw it away.</li>

    <li> Can&#x27;t complain about the price on this one - and nice color too.  I had trouble finding the color I wanted in the store and this made for an easy shopping trip.</li>
    <li> Every color was just too light/too greasy and too shimmery, three things I&#x27;m not a fan of.</li>
    <li> Love the color, love the moisturizing formula, love that bit of shine it gives to my lips.  Love!</li>
    <li> I also was expecting a reddish color, and received a lit color that did not match my skin tone, however I do like the feel of this product on my lips, so I will be finding this product in my color.</li>
    <li> It is very good and more than expected&lt;br /&gt;as it is very nice and well handled.&lt;br /&gt;It is very good and more than expected&lt;br /&gt;as it is very nice and well handled.</li>

    <li> I adore this lipstick. I don&#x27;t normally wear lip color, but when I do, I wear this one. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as other lip colors but you can&#x27;t beat the price (so a couple reapplications won&#x27;t break the bank). Plus it&#x27;s very moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t dry the lips like many other lipsticks do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 11.05.2014: I just discovered these are discontinued. I&#x27;m so sad!!</li>

    <li> Beautiful color&lt;br /&gt;Smells awesome&lt;br /&gt;Looks good with my skin color&lt;br /&gt;Im so happy with it, I hope it lasts a lot.</li>
    <li> This lipstick only lasted me two weeks and then it was gone but the color itself is a very beautiful frosty mauve.</li>
    <li> Bought two for her as she loves the color. She said one shade was slightly darker, but who cares. Slides on smooth and lasts almost all day.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a red lipstick but when I opened it I found the color was a walnut color (the same color as my lips). I was satisfied with the texture and it felt great on my lips I just wish it was more reddish</li>
    <li> Perfect color, great price.  Great lipstick, stays on well, perfect color.  Price is better than local retail.  Free shipping!  Win, win!</li>
    <li> The color isn&#x27;t what I expected! It&#x27;s too.. Blah.. Didn&#x27;t like it, but I guess it can go with my lipstick collection!</li>
    <li> I gave this item a 1 star review because I would not recommend buying anything without a protective seal. The lipstick came without any type of wrapping, box, seal or anything. It was opened so for security reasons, I chose not to use this. I would not buy this again from this seller unless I checked ahead of time to make sure it was sealed new.</li>
    <li> great color great for fair complexions not drying stays true for quite awhile without having to be reapplied. fast delivery packed well received when promised great price as well.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product!</li>
    <li> Good , nice and cheap ... thanks</li>
    <li> Usually pinks don&#x27;t look good on my light olive complexion.  But for the price I gave it a go.  I&#x27;m not disappointed.  The color is shiny and beautiful.  It&#x27;s also moisturizing.</li>
