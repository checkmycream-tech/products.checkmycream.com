      <li>I liked that it had a bit of &#x27;grit&#x27; to it when applied to the scalp cool.</li>
      <li>a quick run in some warm water helped a lot.</li>
      <li>This oil is very nourishing and smells exotic, but in a good way.</li>

      <li>I must say the very first try I was in love.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the light scent of this oil.</li>
      <li>The smell is so invigorating (if you enjoy the smell of coconuts.)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I recently bought this with other essential oils and when it came in the mail, it was not in liquid form. I let it sit for a couple of days, and when trying to use it again, there was some liquid, but there was also little chunks of cocunut oil as well.     I&#x27;m not sure how long that&#x27;s going to be for, but when rubbed into your palms, the chunks disappear. Besides that, I do like to use it right after I wash my hair or as a pre-poo to make my hair softer.     Either way, coconut oil is a must-have for any woman with natural hair.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and I am very glad I did.  My hair has grown so much, and it is also very thick and healthy. I use this as a hot oil treatment and occasionally as a leave in scalp dressing/treatment.</li>
    <li> I bought this the same time I bought some amla oil.  My amla oil is now in the back of the closet with no plans to use again.  This oil however is fantastic.  The smell isn&#x27;t great but it isn&#x27;t bad like the amla is.  I have been using this as a prepoo and mixed in with my powders.  My hair is becoming so soft and I am ticked that I haven&#x27;t found these products earlier in life.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on the supposed growth properties but it works wonders for dry brittle hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have fallen in love with. I use this product on my the shaft of my hair and on the ends. It has eliminated breakage and split ends. I also use it on my daughter ends and it has really decreased her breakage. I love this product and I will continue to use it as long as its available for sale. I would recommend this product for African American hair. Its not oily and it absords very fast. This is great and Im very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product contains harmful chemical ingredients. It claims to be natural and yet has cancerous ingredients. I trashed it.</li>
    <li> This oil is very nourishing and smells exotic, but in a good way. It is also very lite and I like to massage my scalp with it before I wash my hair and use it on my scalp before I dry it on the cool set using my hand held blow dryer. I only use it about twice a week to keep my hair and ends looking great and it absorbs very easily into my scalp and the ends of my hair. I just need to purchase a larger bottle the next time. Also, I can see this product lasting for about 2 1/2 to 3 months. I am in love!</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil in my hair - that being said, this product is great. I run through jars of regular coconut oil pretty often and it gets a bit messy digging in the jar. It is typically pretty cold in my house so I did have a problem with the oil solidifying but I know that coconut oil tends to solidify so this didn&#x27;t really bother me - a quick run in some warm water helped a lot.</li>
    <li> This item was shipped really fast and its one of my favorite oils lovely smell and it gives ur hair a wonderful shine and make it nice and smooth love this.</li>
    <li> The product I bought was only .45 cents and I paid $5 for tax and shipping. I feel like a fool now that I think about it. I could have went to Sally&#x27;s and gotten this same product for probably cheaper same day.  I still haven&#x27;t received it and it has been over a week now.</li>
    <li> Do not use this product if you have coarse curly hair (i.e. black) It completely dried out my hair!  I only used it a few times.  My hair is so dry now and not just on the ends, at the roots too (which has never happened before).</li>
    <li> Very good oil for natural hair. I mix it with my leave in conditioner. I also use it 3 to 4 times a week on my ends.Makes my hair really soft. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I heard such wonderful things about this coconut oil so I decided to give it a try. Glad I purchased a smaller bottle because I definitely prefer pure refined coconut oil to this. I feel like this is somewhat drying to my hair it does not melt evenly so I often get weird grainy bits in my hair and the small is not the most pleasant. I prefer the scent of pure refined coconut oil that I purchase at whole food and it goes on oh so smooth. Will not be purchasing this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4A natural-kinky/curly hair</li>
    <li> As a woman with natural hair first off I want a product that works for my hair and second is smell. However in this situation the smell deters me from using the rest of the bottle on a daily basis. The only time i think that I would ever use this product is if I was doing a prepoo (covering my hair in oils before I shampoo it) but I might not even do that for fear that my hair will smell like it regardless of the amount of soap or conditioner I use. The smell is absolutely disgusting. It has a hint of coconut and then the rest is indescribable. I would not recommend this product it doesn&#x27;t do anything out of the ordinary or extravagant. Although I am partially biased since I do not like the smell of coconut I do use organic coconut oil on my hair and despite the smell it works so well I continue to use it. in addition the smell of organic coconut oil is subtle and doesn&#x27;t even compare to the pungent stench of vatika oil. Ladies who use this regularly I really don&#x27;t know how you do it. Also I thought about putting some essential oils in it but id rather not waste my money because the smell is so strong it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
    <li> Yess, the product is a lil greasy however; its UmMazIn. I use it on my daughter as well.... and the smell is great</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my hair sheds badly. It said helps hair fall but my hair sheds rhe same if not more. The pro is ir makes my hair soft and the smell is great.</li>
    <li> I must say the delivery was super fast and extremely affordable . This product is awesome . I will be ordering more of this product for gifts .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil it help retain moisture in my hair and keeps my hair soft. Also, it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is not just Coconut Oil, but it is a great mix for hair care. I&#x27;ve had to sit on a heating pad so it would stay liquid, but I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product - I mean its coconut oil! lol. Just too small and sometimes difficult to squeeze out. But I use it in my daughter&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s definitely aided in sheen and growth!</li>
    <li> I tried this product a couple days ago. I did not like it because of the smell and it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. To be fair I don&#x27;t know if this was for a particular ethnicity. My hair is semi curly and highlighted blonde. It is normally fairly soft. Color treatment seems to dry my hair so I tried this product. I assumed it would smell something fragrant or like coconut, but it smelled like a medicine rubs (my best example).  My hair was not any better than before I tried it.</li>
    <li> This product came in a smaller (I believe the older) bottle. Shipping was fast and I was satisfied with the packaging. The product doesn&#x27;t smell that great, but it&#x27;s great for the hair and I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now and it&#x27;s still not run out.</li>
    <li> Yes this product is a smelly item, like a sushi restaurant, and I give it 3/10. I recommend regular coconut oil from the store</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. It helped with my fly aways, and my dry scalp on contact. I am using it as a pre-poo on my half weaved installment. I must say the very first try I was in love. I have also purchased two other conditioners from the Vatika line&lt;br /&gt;I will let you guys know how that worked out. So far so good. I have 3c and some 4a type hair. So you know my scalp and my hair is very very dry,  I am sold. Vatika Coconut Hair oil gets 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> It took almost 3 weeks for me to receive this product because it somehow got stuck in the post office (I literally live in the same state that this item was shipped from). When I finally did receive the item it had no expiration date. For all I know this thing could already be expired and I don&#x27;t know. I ordered the almond and sesame version of this oil from ebay and did not have this problem. I guess I&#x27;ll be ordering all my hair oils from there from now on.</li>
    <li> Heat up and pour over wet hair and leave over night. My hair is curly and soft and started using on my kid&#x27;s hair to help them with their extra dry brittle hair.</li>
    <li> So hard to squeeze out of the bottle.  And being a single parent without a man in the house, most of it is wasted.  :(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t  pay attention to how little is the bottle for that much money , it really very expensive</li>
    <li> I have used other Dabur oils and this one only works well as a pre-shampoo oil. I cannot use the oil otherwise.</li>
    <li> I love this oil a little goes a long way too. The smell is a little annoying but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Before ordering I did a lot of research and I saw this had rave reviews so I decided to try it. My hair is natural, African-American hair not permed. It gets dry at times so I wanted this to seal in moisture. I received the product and noticed it was hard inside the bottle, as if it was a solid. So I ran it under some warm water and it became liquid. It was actually a good sign it was solid because real coconut oil is solid so that showed me it was real coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I tried the product. I used it to seal in moisture on my ends and throughout my hair. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. My hair was so soft and so moisturizer for days. I live in Massachusetts where it is cold. When I used other oils, I had to moisturizer and seal every other day. With this stuff I have to do it only once every 5-6 days. For the price this is a great little gem and is definitely my HG.</li>
    <li> She has really textured hair. Shes half black half white so I gave her this product because its healthy for your hair and she wore her hair in a pony tail and the curls were not as frizzy. However I wouldn&#x27;t want a product to completely tame her hair because its her trademark and she has thick beautiful curls that I cant imagine her without.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for three years!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is tiny.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way! I have natural thick 4b/4z jk hair!&lt;br /&gt;It softens the curl pattern to make it more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I part my hair in four sections and I only need a dime size for each sections (i have a big head..im quite shocked)&lt;br /&gt;It smells like herbs.....like it&#x27;ll do something good!&lt;br /&gt;Sighs I wish the bottle was different on the website they have revamped the bottle! Anywho it works so work it! and my hair is growing like crazy</li>
    <li> if you can get past the strong smell, you may like.</li>
    <li> I really love using this to pre- poo my hair.  It makes hair very manageable and soft after it is rinsed from your hair.  A little goes a long way so you don&#x27;t need much.  This is a staple product for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product to condition my hair.  It smells great and leave my hair looking wonderful.....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece, who is mixed and has a lot of coarse hair.  I haven&#x27;t tried it myself, but she said she really likes it and uses it each time after she washes her hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product! Anyone whose natural should definitely add this to their natural hair care reigemn!! A must have!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. It softens the hair without agreasy feeling and absorbs right into the hair.</li>
    <li> If you are of Black Descent.. ( and really, who isn&#x27;t?) This is the perfect product for you.  I use after washing while hair is slightly damp after towel dry. , After you hair air dries, it will have a magnificent sheen for at least 2 weeks. WHen my hair begins to dry out, I continue to add a little Olive Oil to maintain sheen.  Thhis product is a MUST HAVE for Black women.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! When I use it I get all sorts of compliments on how nice I smell, or how pretty my hair is. When I wash my hair it washes out just fine, even leaves my hair smoother. I usually run this through my hair when it&#x27;s damp. I also use it when my hair is dry. I have had not issues with this product.</li>
    <li> Ok so the oil is great. However, i only gave it 3 stars because of the tube. Once the oil starts to get cold again which is quickly now that its winter. It is hard for the product to be distributed. So i would say 4 stars for product and 2 stars for packaging.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and wanted to love this so bad, but the scent of this is a not one that I like so I hardly use it.  :(</li>
    <li> First of all, I got this because I&#x27;ve been hearing all the hype about this Vatika Oil from my friends. I didn&#x27;t want to buy the entire bottle but at the same time I wanted my own to test it out periodically; so this small bottle was very convienient. When I got it, I wasn&#x27;t very shocked about the thickness of the oil because of the reviews I read beforehand. I stuck it in some wamr/hot water waited until it liquified and put it in my hair in sections. The smell was different. Not a bad different, but a strange sweet smelling thick serum came out. I like it now, rather than the prominent smell of coconut from my unrefined coconut mix (And I dislike coconut altogether). It&#x27;s lasted me quite a while and I put it on my hair whenever I feel it gets too dry, or brittle because it softens it right up.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this product and this seller. I will be buying this again from them next month.</li>
    <li> very good product, i get mine from an indian corner store by my hair salon,i really love it, it does not smell too good but nothing bothersome. i use it after washing my hair in my scalp, sometimes i use it in my pre-poo , than if my hair feels dry , i will sometimes massage my scalp with it..  -1 star just because of the smell but other than that it makes my hair soft, nourishes it and im not sure if it contributed to my hair growth , since i follow a hair regiment however i know it does not break my hair cuz my hair is still growing like weed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from an aryuvedic web site and I was impressed! The smell is so invigorating (if you enjoy the smell of coconuts.) I liked that it had a bit of &#x27;grit&#x27; to it when applied to the scalp cool. It easily melts. I have heard this product pronounced as Vuh-TEE-Kuh and VAH-ti-Kah. Either way, this stuff is great and now I am a believer!</li>
    <li> I can only put this on my hair at night before I go to bed and I must wash it out in the morning.  It makes your hair very greasy.  And it isn&#x27;t in liquid form in the bottle.  You must run the bottle under hot water to liquify this stuff.  It&#x27;s all coagulated and hard in the bottle.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice but it seems to really make my hair very soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Although item arrived in timely manner the product itself wasn&#x27;t to my liking. I should of ordered the almond oil. I don&#x27;t like the odor of this oil.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It provides the moisture and slip my and my daughters hair needs. The scent is pleasant, but a little strong. However we don&#x27;t find it off putting.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well enough on your hair, but I would only recommend it for doing your strands and not for the scalp. The lemon oil in the hair oil can actually be quite drying on your scalp. I would recommend another hair oil that is just coconut oil as those will be gentler and more nourishing to the scalp.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of coconut oil mixed with other beneficial ingredients.  I have 3C/4A hair so it can get really thirsty at times.  This provides my hair feel with just the moisturize it needs.  A great daily sun protector for my hair too.</li>
    <li> this product is not for everyone it more dries my hair out than lock moisture. People&#x27;s choice and preference....not mines. We&#x27;ll I tried</li>
    <li> moisture hair without weighing it down. good product. I recommend. I see hair growth to using this product within 2 months</li>
    <li> I use coconut oil to help moisturize my thin hair.  This does seem to work and it smells nice...not sure I want to sleep with it on my head as it recommends, but so far just using it a few times a week for about an hour...seems to be doing the trick!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from one of the young ladies that I subscribed to on YouTube and she raved about it all the time, so I decided to try it out for myself since I am natural with very fine hair and I can say without a doubt, this oil has made my hair much thicker and shiner. I love it. I have also put in an order to try some of their mask to see how those will work, but I will definitely be using this and buying much more of this product. I love the smell and I use it on wet, damp and dry hair, this is my go to oil for my hair.</li>
    <li> I leaves your hair soft. I used it over night and my hair felt great. It not a scent that I&#x27;m use to so I would recommend just using it a night.</li>
    <li> even for my dry coarse hair, it is VERY greasy. if i use more than a tiny dab, it makes my dry coarse hair unusually oily and stringy. :( i wish it was better.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shine without being greasy looking.  You just need to use a tiny bit so the bottle should last forever.</li>
    <li> Definitely works.  I wanted something to soften my hair and it works.  Should be used no more than once a week.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product before, but I&#x27;ve heard it makes your hair grow really quick.  I was expecting to have a liquid type application, it&#x27;s more like solid/crisco consistency.  Once rubbed between the palms it turns into an oil.  Smells good.  Shipping was kind of long, but I received it in about a week and a half/two weeks.</li>
    <li> I Love the difference in how my hair feels... was gratefull to have found this product.. My hair was so dry &amp; getting thinner.. I was getting really insecure about it.. This stuff has my hair getting alot less tangled and I love running my fingers threw it, like when I was a younger &amp; had thicker fuller hair.. Hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much.. whew!!! what a relief....</li>
    <li> Very good deal...I was looking for this product at a reasonable price and was able to get a bottle for less than $2.00.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easily distributable. Love the application. Silky. Wish it came in a larger size with the same method of distribution. Also wish I could find it locally</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the light scent of this oil. It is a citrus coconut blend, but is not overwhelming at all. Add it to a deep conditioner for super soft hair.. A must for winter months to keep breakage at bay. Good stuff, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like using the hair oil on my hair.  You have to squeeze the bottle to get it out ....sometime it&#x27;s hard to get out because it is solid. Other then that it keeps my hair moist.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil However, I was extremly confused when It came in the mail.... IT WAS SOLID! So just to leave a few tips, When making the oil liquid I took the cap off poked a hole in the lid over the oil and heated it in the microwave for 2 - 20 second sessions or until it was liquid. Afterwards the oil did get solid slightly but repeating this process will keep it liquid! This oil is awesome and I would buy again!</li>
    <li> If you use EVCO (I like Nutiva EVCO), let it sit out at room (or above) room temperature, and massage it into your scalp. It works just as good as this.</li>
    <li> Love this product, don&#x27;t need much and works great on wet hair and dry hair. will buy again</li>
    <li> I rated this before and my feelings remain the same, I hate it! I don&#x27; t know if the bottle I received was old or what. It  smells awful and is way too greasy. Never purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this for over three years now... keeps my hair moisturized and soft I use it with conditioners and just to give my hair a little shine. quick shipment as usual thanks amazon</li>
    <li> I use this over night and it washed off easily in the morning. My hair was straight and full. I would definitely recommend. I like the smell too!</li>
    <li> I have never used Vatika before ordering but I heard such great stuff I wanted to try it out. So far I like it, it makes my hair really soft and the sell isn&#x27;t all that but it goes away soon after so no worries.</li>
    <li> Great stuff with multiple uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say except my hair loves this stuff! I oil my hair at night and tie it down and in the morning my new growth is soft and my hair looks well moisturized.</li>
    <li> I used it as a pre-poo and it worked well but not too much different than regular coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Shipped well. Great product.  Works well for dry scalp and conditions very well but the smell is what will get to you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for well over a year now and I will continue to use it because it is fantastic and the price is very reasonable.  I have very long (butt length) curly, color treated hair and once or twice a week I apply the oil to my dry hair starting at the ends.  I make sure the ends are completely saturated and as I go higher up on my head I use a little less so there is only a little oil on my scalp.  Then I wrap it up in a head wrap and leave it in overnight.  In the morning I wash, condition and style as usual and my hair is left shiny, healthy, and my loose curls are more defined.  I wholeheartedly recommend this product.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut oil but thats ok because the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> Got it to grow edges back it didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Love it...my hair is healthy and growing even faster</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly long hair, I use the conditioner once a week, it is so good that I don&#x27;t have to put in any other product. This curls my hair just like the best hair products would. Lasts the entire week. I also enjoy the smell and how it strengthens my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the smell just hate the size of the bottle its so small but it does moisturize my hair</li>
    <li> was hard to get out, very thick and dries up quickly. hard to even get to pour out. wont purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells good and smells great. Great conditioner would not use as a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;Only suggestion is that the inner lid is annoying and takes forever to ge the product out.</li>
    <li> smaller than i expected but a great product. I gave it to my friend because it was to heavy for my hair</li>
    <li> Its good but I found this coconut oil in my hometown cheaper. I wish I would have waited before I got it off of amazon .com</li>
    <li> Really good stuff!  Makes my hair soft and shiny.  I use it as a deep conditioner.  And it smells nice too.  Actually lasts WAY longer than I thought it would.  Doesn&#x27;t take much to do a hot oil treatment.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> so i was so eager to try this because so many people talked about it and it was suggested to me by someone. i used to use extra virgin coconut oil and really loved how it made my hair feel. my hair absorbed it, and felt soft and moisterized. when i started using this i noticed it didnt feel the same but i figured it was because of the extra ingredients. after some online research i learned its just regular coconut oil. now i usually dont care about things like that, but i was surprised to learn how much of it difference it makes to the hair. vatika coconut oil just sort of sits on my hair. i have tried using it with a heating cap but nothing. i am aware many people love it and claim it made a difference in their hair. i have used it for about 2months and its done nothing for my hair. i have really thick, kinky natural hair. which kind of bummed me out. when my bottle is finished, im going back to good ol extra virgin coconut oil..</li>
    <li> I love this oil! my hair comes out so soft and nice after using it. It is easy to use and heat up.</li>
