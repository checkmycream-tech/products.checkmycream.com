      <li>and now I have a unit (approx 10 inches) that is serving me much better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really love it&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>Also, it didn&#x27;t look like it is 16 inch, more like 14 or shorter.</li>

      <li>I am satisfied with the wig and  was pleased to receive a wig cap as well.  </li>

      <li>This wig is truly 100% Remy human hair and is very beautiful, light , and the seller has not exaggerated on the quality of its workmanship!!</li>
      <li>You can see the tracks easily in this wig and also sheds.</li>
      <li>I was instructed not to cut the lace until I&#x27;m fully satisfied, so it&#x27;s a work in progress, the lace is super soft, the hair is gorgeous, I love it.....</li>
      <li>the lace is so soft and the hair feels amazing!</li>
      <li>One of the best human Hair wig I have ever purchase, soft and has a nice curl to it,  look real natural... keep up the good Work and</li>

      <li>I&#x27;d recomend not only this product to anyone looking to get a great product and true value for money.</li>
      <li>Same as picture ,,,love it a lot nice smooth hair</li>
      <li>so far I&#x27;m loving it....</li>
      <li>Definitely doesn&#x27;t look as good as the image posted by the customer on 2/15.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;The wig seems to be good quality, but not as long or as full as the photo.</li>
      <li>hair stays soft and beautiful for days, I wash evey week, and I finger comb for bigger curls.</li>
      <li>Instead of soft curls, it has more of a kinky kurly pattern.</li>
      <li>Wig was vey beautiful, however sheds fast and not worth the money</li>
      <li>When I got this wig I right away knew is that I got cheated.</li>

      <li>and i would live to buy more in the future ....</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to NOT buy this wig!</li>
      <li>REALLY REALLY TANGLED, AND</li>
      <li>The fabric used inside is stretch net that fits perfectly whether you have a big or small head.</li>
      <li>The  16 inch wig is super short it stops at your ear lobes.</li>
      <li>Looks nothing like picture, but decent wig.</li>
      <li>yes I did pay the extra for express delivery, and it was well worth it...</li>
      <li>The fine hair all around allows you flexibility of style that would otherwise give away other wigs.</li>
      <li>BUT DON&#x27;T WASH IT, ONLY WHEN YOU FIRST GET</li>
      <li>, IT LOOKS SO NATURAL.</li>
      <li>They do not provide information about the product as far as tracking it....</li>
      <li>The only issues I have is that it smells and no matter what you do it still smells also it will get really matted in about 30 days.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly - came at least a week sooner&lt;</li>

<li> The worse hair I ever purchased on Amazon.</li>
<li> It looks as thin as a Halloween synthetic wig.</li>
<li> It looked like a black shag toupee  that smelled awful!</li>
<li> I guess it wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
<li> CAUSE IT SMELLS BAD.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m slightly disappointed.</li>
<li> This was very disappointing and a blow to my wallet.</li>
<li> and I was so disappointed that the wig looks nothing like the picture!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> One of the best human Hair wig I have ever purchase, soft and has a nice curl to it,  look real natural... keep up the good Work and also great customer service 👍🙏👏🙆💁</li>
    <li> The wig is great when you first receive it.  But tangles after 5 weeks.</li>
    <li> This wig looked nothing like the pic.. I couldn&#x27;t do anything with the wig (flat iron, style it, I couldn&#x27;t even put it in a ponytail). I ended up throwing it away... Will never buy from this vendor ever again</li>
    <li> It took me awhile to receive my wig but I took into consideration that it was coming from China. The wig is soft and beautiful! It took some adjusting it due to it being packaged and shipped. I have it on a styrofoam head and will wear &#x27;her&#x27; on occasions. I am satisfied with the wig and  was pleased to receive a wig cap as well.  The wig is super sexy and the price was nice!</li>
    <li> This wig is really nice. It is a good quality wig. The hair is beautiful and it is well made. The fullness of the wig depends on how you like to wear it. You can fluff and make it fuller. My only reserve is the length because it is wavey it feels more like a 14 in but other than that I Love It!!!</li>
    <li> One thing I do before purchasing hair is I read the reviews , I seen allot of of great review for this wig and for the price I guess it wasn&#x27;t as bad. When I got this wig I right away knew is that I got cheated. It looks as thin as a Halloween synthetic wig. You can see the tracks easily in this wig and also sheds. The worse hair I ever purchased on Amazon. Not worth the money !!</li>
    <li> I really like this wig and have ordered it several times as my everyday wig. The only issues I have is that it smells and no matter what you do it still smells also it will get really matted in about 30 days.</li>
    <li> LET&#x27;S BE HONEST ABOUT THIS WIG!!!  IT&#x27;S BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOU FIRST GET IT, IT LOOKS SO NATURAL. BUT DON&#x27;T WASH IT, ONLY WHEN YOU FIRST GET CAUSE IT SMELLS BAD. DON&#x27;T LAY DOWN, OR SLEEP IN IT BECAUSE IT GET&#x27;S REALLY REALLY TANGLED, AND IT MATTS UP IN A BIG BALL. SO IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND FOR A WIG THAT LAST ABOUT 30 DAYS, THEN GO FOR IT!!! BUT I DON&#x27;T THINK THAT THIS IS HUMAN HAIR!</li>
    <li> I like this unit. The only thing that drives me nuts is the bad knots to get every evening. I have cut this to a bob which is working out well. I have spent (wasted)  money to buy this length and now I have a unit (approx 10 inches) that is serving me much better.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t stop wearing it since I purchased it ... I&#x27;ve also washed it ... Great wig</li>
    <li> Wig was vey beautiful, however sheds fast and not worth the money</li>
    <li> soft texture, feels natural but loses its volume after wash.</li>
    <li> I just received my wig today and I absolutely love it!!! the lace is so soft and the hair feels amazing! i received it in two weeks, I would definitely recommend to buy... great price for this item also. my plan is to get my hair braided down and have it sewn on. ill post pics later</li>
    <li> I received  this wig today and it looks nothing like the photo.The  16 inch wig is super short it stops at your ear lobes. The hair was not curly at all.It looked like a black shag toupee  that smelled awful! If i could give zero stars i would.</li>
    <li> They do not provide information about the product as far as tracking it....I like to know where my item is at all times. Expecially when I pay a lot of money for it...I hope it is the best wig I have ever played eyes on BC so far I am not pleased</li>
    <li> Same as picture ,,,love it a lot nice smooth hair&lt;br /&gt;Really love it&lt;br /&gt;Good comunication with the celler and i would live to buy more in the future .... An issue is the wig not really thick hair , but it doesnt matter coz its curley and not full lace&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot 👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast!  Hair is not the same hair as advertised. Not even close. I got a Jerry curl wig.&lt;br /&gt;So buyer be aware!!I am keeping hair because it is pretty and dyes well! Over all I am satisfied but not what I thought I was getting. I guess it&#x27;s ment to be.</li>
    <li> I love it ! Feels natural, looks natural, and shipped quickly, I absolutely loved this will purchase more inthe future</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;The wig seems to be good quality, but not as long or as full as the photo. If you&#x27;re looking for a longer wig, this one is not it. It actually appears to be very short. The quality of the hair is good, but it sheds quite a bit. I&#x27;m slightly disappointed. I won&#x27;t be returning it, as I don&#x27;t want to go through that long drawn out process, but I would not purchase this wig again.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who is going Chemo, &amp; she said, that this wig is so thin it shows the scalp. Also, it didn&#x27;t look like it is 16 inch, more like 14 or shorter. So, I took a look and I was so disappointed that the wig looks nothing like the picture! I highly recommend to NOT buy this wig! Wasted money! I would have returned it for her, but it is not free return &amp; the company is in China.</li>
    <li> The cap is for a person with a very large head.  the hair was decent but not the best.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the same curl as shown in pic.😕</li>
    <li> This wig is truly 100% Remy human hair and is very beautiful, light , and the seller has not exaggerated on the quality of its workmanship!! The fabric used inside is stretch net that fits perfectly whether you have a big or small head. The fine hair all around allows you flexibility of style that would otherwise give away other wigs. The elastic is srwn into the lace, a plus for those who get irritated on contact with elastane!! This to me was the best part as it allows me a longer, more comfortable wearing. It also comes with comb pins that are comfortably fitted and more lace at the nape! To crown it all, the service of the staff was simply outstanding!! They communicated the order information, following up till delivery! BRAVO! I&#x27;d recomend not only this product to anyone looking to get a great product and true value for money. I would not hesitate to buy again from this seller!!</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like picture, but decent wig. Definitely doesn&#x27;t look as good as the image posted by the customer on 2/15.</li>
    <li> It looks nothing like the picture. Instead of soft curls, it has more of a kinky kurly pattern. Plus the lace on the sides are like sideburns. I have never seen that before. There are no baby hairs like you see in the pic either. This was very disappointing and a blow to my wallet.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly - came at least a week sooner&lt;br /&gt;Soft, very nice - my granddaughter wears it every day and is very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I just received my wig.... so far I&#x27;m loving it....delivered on time, yes I did pay the extra for express delivery, and it was well worth it...I was instructed not to cut the lace until I&#x27;m fully satisfied, so it&#x27;s a work in progress, the lace is super soft, the hair is gorgeous, I love it.....I&#x27;ll be back to add more and pictures as soon as I cut the lace...I cut the lace off, ran into a small problem, my head is small so wig was kinda big, nothing my needle and thread couldn&#x27;t fix...will order again, longer length and have it custom made to fit...I&#x27;m still loving my hair, just a tip if you buy this wig, cowash the hair, I use Eden cowash conditioner, no shampoo...hair stays soft and beautiful for days, I wash evey week, and I finger comb for bigger curls.</li>
