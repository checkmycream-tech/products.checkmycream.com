<ol>
      <li>One of the best hair products on the market.  </li>
      <li>This works the best for me!</li>
      <li>This is perfect.</li>
      <li>Best control with no stickiness.</li>
      <li>Awesome product and smell great</li>
      <li>Johnny B is a great product.</li>
      <li>Johnny B isn&#x27;t just for men, it&#x27;s great for ladies too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>This hair cream is amazing!</li>
      <li>Good product smells very nice and holds style like it should.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love using this!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very easy to style with it if you use a comb or distribute</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>This product is OK, but it did not set the world on fire.  </li>
      <li>Received the item on timely fashion &amp; love the product.  </li>
      <li>fast, cheap, and great quality &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Perfect hold, not too sticky or crunchy, and the smell is nice and subtle.</li>
      <li>I use maybe a quarter sized amount for my entire head, which is pretty impressive.</li>
      <li>This stuff is cheap, and deservedly so.</li>
      <li>far, I like it more than my Johnny B Original for more textured and &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; looks, but I love just about all the products from these guys.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not bad though, it kind of feels like your hair is just really moisturized.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not very thick and doesn&#x27;t hve that nice smell of the gel</li>
      <li>The finish looks great, it&#x27;s matte in a way that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;my hair is damaged and has no natural oils&amp;#34; but isn&#x27;t so flat that your hair doesn&#x27;t pick up light, if that makes</li>
      <li>If you want to be able to reshape and retouch your hair throughout the day, I would recommend a product like &amp;#60;link&amp;#62;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NWO9G6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2&amp;#60;/link&amp;#62;, which is worth the extra expense, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>Similar to most products out there.  </li>
      <li>I spent a good hour outside in some strong wind and my fauxhawk barely had a hair out of place</li>
      <li>have a pixie cut, but naturally curly hair which means I usually have to straighten my hair in some for to be able to style it more than one way.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s straight when you apply it, it&#x27;ll stay straight all day.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That said, it DOES hold a style very well.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it on Amazon, this cream is really not just for men, but also for women too.</li>
      <li>It also lasts through a hot, humid day outside!</li>
      <li>Holds hair all day with a natural look.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry hard or stiff like a lot of strong hold products do, your hair stays in a format that you can easily run your fingers through or even re-style later in the day.</li>

<li> I like something a little more sticky and a little less greasy.</li>
<li> I have thick hair, but generally don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of this stuff to get my hair where I want it and keep it that way.</li>
<li> ... makes your hair feel dry, sticky, and not &amp;#34;reshape-able&amp;#34; throughout the day.</li>
<li> I love Johnny B Street Cream, but because it&#x27;s basically impossible to find anywhere, I&#x27;ve given up.</li>
<li> It leaves the hair feeling dry, non sticky and doesn&#x27;t give hair the wet look.</li>
<li> is carefully.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried many sculpting products and found it typically takes a large amount to set the style, which also winds up making your hair feel dirty and unhealthy looking because it ruins the shine.</li>
<li> Seriously if you want to look natural without greasy and brittle hair go with this stuff ....</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy or slick, but you can feel the residue on your hair through the day</li>
<li> He doesn&#x27;t like his hair to feel to hard or sticky and this product yields the desired results.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Street Cream applies as thick as it&#x27;s consistency</li>
<li> As a guy it&#x27;s hard to find variety!</li>
<li> Too bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> fast, cheap, and great quality &#x3D;) thanks!</li>
    <li> This stuff is cheap, and deservedly so. It goes into your hair nicely enough, but once it&#x27;s in, it becomes like gel... makes your hair feel dry, sticky, and not &amp;#34;reshape-able&amp;#34; throughout the day. I purchased it based on my barber&#x27;s raving review, but it&#x27;s sitting in my bathroom drawer after using it once. If you want to be able to reshape and retouch your hair throughout the day, I would recommend a product like &amp;#60;link&amp;#62;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NWO9G6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2&amp;#60;/link&amp;#62;, which is worth the extra expense, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Too pricey for the amount it had.</li>
    <li> Good product smells very nice and holds style like it should. Quality product could&#x27;ve saved a bunch if it weren&#x27;t for shipping &amp; handling.</li>
    <li> Johnny B is a great product. It&#x27;s not greasy like some, but a drier paste that does what it promises. I&#x27;ve tried many sculpting products and found it typically takes a large amount to set the style, which also winds up making your hair feel dirty and unhealthy looking because it ruins the shine. This product holds the style of your hair and the shine all day. I love it!</li>
    <li> Best control with no stickiness. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This product is OK, but it did not set the world on fire.  Similar to most products out there.  I like something a little more sticky and a little less greasy.</li>
    <li> This works the best for me!</li>
    <li> Husband loves this.  I find it sticky/waxy when I touch his hair.</li>
    <li> Holds hair all day with a natural look. Works great.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product!  He doesn&#x27;t like his hair to feel to hard or sticky and this product yields the desired results.  It also lasts through a hot, humid day outside!</li>
    <li> Received the item on timely fashion &amp; love the product.  The beauty salon I go to, used to carry it, however, they discontinued stocking it.  So glad I found it on Amazon, this cream is really not just for men, but also for women too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Been searching for this product all my life ! Seriously if you want to look natural without greasy and brittle hair go with this stuff .... love it</li>
    <li> I love Johnny B Street Cream, but because it&#x27;s basically impossible to find anywhere, I&#x27;ve given up. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice from Amazon and never received it. I didn&#x27;t expect to, frankly. Johnny B is a product that should be sold through places like Ulta and Sephora, but for whatever reason, isn&#x27;t. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Love using this! It&#x27;s a must buy. I switch up so often on hair car products. As a guy it&#x27;s hard to find variety! This is perfect. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching up anytime soon!</li>
    <li> One of the best hair products on the market.  Perfect hold, not too sticky or crunchy, and the smell is nice and subtle.</li>
    <li> This hair cream is amazing! It leaves the hair feeling dry, non sticky and doesn&#x27;t give hair the wet look.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very thick and doesn&#x27;t hve that nice smell of the gel</li>
    <li> Johnny B isn&#x27;t just for men, it&#x27;s great for ladies too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pixie cut, but naturally curly hair which means I usually have to straighten my hair in some for to be able to style it more than one way. A lot of styling gels, mousses, creams, and lotions will cause straightened hair to curl and kink up again, ruining all your work. Not Johnny B! If it&#x27;s straight when you apply it, it&#x27;ll stay straight all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Street Cream applies as thick as it&#x27;s consistency but it&#x27;s very easy to style with it if you use a comb or distribute is carefully. I have thick hair, but generally don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of this stuff to get my hair where I want it and keep it that way. I use maybe a quarter sized amount for my entire head, which is pretty impressive. It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy or slick, but you can feel the residue on your hair through the day, it&#x27;s not bad though, it kind of feels like your hair is just really moisturized. The finish looks great, it&#x27;s matte in a way that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;my hair is damaged and has no natural oils&amp;#34; but isn&#x27;t so flat that your hair doesn&#x27;t pick up light, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry hard or stiff like a lot of strong hold products do, your hair stays in a format that you can easily run your fingers through or even re-style later in the day. That said, it DOES hold a style very well. I spent a good hour outside in some strong wind and my fauxhawk barely had a hair out of place afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I like it more than my Johnny B Original for more textured and &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; looks, but I love just about all the products from these guys.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and smell great</li>
