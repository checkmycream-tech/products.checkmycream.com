<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not strong enough to hold my hair</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t the greatest for kids hair but my daughter likes wearing one anyway.  I used the smaller one for her. Couldn&#x27;t get the clip to &amp;#34;hide&amp;#34; under her hair very well at all. It does create beautiful curls though.  The quality is is ok.  Metal bends so easily it&#x27;s difficult to keep the product in the correct shape.  I received this product at a discount and am giving my honest opinion on it.  Hopefully after trying it more I can maybe get it to work better.</li>
    <li> only lasts a few times</li>
    <li> Took a little long to come due to it being overseas, but after it came its a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> These are great if you know how to do your own hair or have someone who can help you use these.</li>
    <li> These work so well! I&#x27;ve been using them for almost a year and they&#x27;re still working nice. After so many buns, I&#x27;ve gotten great at wearing these.</li>
    <li> This simply works to put my hair up in hot weather...............&lt;br /&gt;This is better than all those sponge rubber buns</li>
    <li> Takes a few times to get it right but they work great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work. Too weak. Do not hold in place. Are mostly designed for kids with little hair. Very bad purchase</li>
    <li> This product is very cheaply made, does not perform as described and is basically a flexible wire covered with coat hanger foam. There are no instructions on how to use.</li>
    <li> It is too flimsy to hold my hair in place...</li>
    <li> Ordered these and it says a set of 2 when I got them only got 1 in the package. So very unsatisfied....</li>
    <li> They worked okay for what we needed. Not perfect though...</li>
    <li> Product did not come with instructions so it was a bit difficult to figure out.  Then the metal under the foam covering ripped through.  I did receive a full refund and they were easy to work with on that.  Maybe your experience will be better than mine.  Buyer be ware!</li>
    <li> Cheap material and the small didn&#x27;t hold my hair or my daughters. :( I wish it had worked for me I was so looking forward to get it! Disappointing!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, it&#x27;s fun and easy to use.  I was even able to use on my daughters fine hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I have been able to put my hair up into a bun much easier without the use of the old rolled up sock I used to use!!!</li>
    <li> My hair isn&#x27;t incredibly think so when I used this and it wasn&#x27;t long enough to make a bun with my hair wrapped around I was disappointed. They were cheap..you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> No directions! I do not know how to use, so they are useless to me. Does anybody know how to use them?</li>
    <li> Its ok just doesn&#x27;t lock close as tight as it should. So I&#x27;d recommend securing your bun with two hair pins for extra hold.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Excellent price!</li>
    <li> My girls love them because they are able to do their own hair</li>
    <li> These holder clis are great. They are so easy to use and they stay in all day. Keeps my hair back off my face great. Thank you for allowing me to review this product.</li>
    <li> yes no more messy horrible homeless looking buns...nice and soft, easy to use yep yep yep i love it...ok ok</li>
    <li> It may just be me, but these did not hold my hair up at all.  I actually bought 2 sets because they were a good deal, and I don&#x27;t see myself ever using them.  Also, they are made out of some kind of foamy material so they rip very easily.</li>
    <li> I really like these. You can make perfect buns with ease! The only thing that bothers me is the quality of the material. I think the material could be a little better. But with this you get 2 small ones and 2 big ones so I guess if one breaks you always have a backup!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, just put your hair in a pony tail, roll it to the base, and put it into a circle, then spread the hair out on the circle, and bobby pin the two sides together. (-:</li>
    <li> This hair clips are everything that they are advertised to be. I highly recommend buying this product. You can create different styles using these clips.</li>
    <li> Did not work. Followed the directions as was wrote or shown and even with the thinnest hair in the house fell out within minutes of walking around the house.</li>
    <li> I love these bun form makers.  We have the mesh one that look like a big donut, but you can&#x27;t really do it yourself and&lt;br /&gt;need so many bobbie pins.  My daughter needs to have bun hair for dance performances and this works really great.  She has layered hair and it&#x27;s all about the same length when put in a high pony, so when she rolls it, it all stays tucked in.  Doesn&#x27;t work as well for my hair that is long same length (strange but true.)  I recommend it for sure for the great price, nice&lt;br /&gt;to have options for hair accessories.  We saw this advertised on TV for about $12.00 for 1 pc.</li>
    <li> I have tried this bun maker, and I have had someone else try to put it in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t work well for my thin, curly/wavy hair. I can&#x27;t figure how to tuck in the ends to conceal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a connair bun maker set from Target for about $5 and it works much better.</li>
    <li> love this it made putting my daughters hair in a perfect bun so easy one of the best i have ever used,i got this at a discount fr my honest review</li>
    <li> Little hard to get use to , but once it is in it looks great!</li>
    <li> They work, but not on super thick hair.  They smell really weird though... and it doesn&#x27;t really go away.  I would still use them regardless.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and the large ones worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;I guess those with thick hair can have a hard time, but anyway I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I can finally make a perfect donut bun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to handle and it saves me from the messy rolling / spreading procedure (and a thousand pins) when doing a sock bun.</li>
    <li> it won&#x27;t hold my hair and when it does it is only for a couple of minutes. I have long hair. that may be why. Maybe it works better for shoulder length hair. too cheap to care, but they asked me to say what I think of it so...sorry.</li>
    <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.  It is a knock-off of the &amp;#34;Hot Buns&amp;#34; hair piece.  It really doesn&#x27;t hold your hair...so, I would say to pass on this one...</li>
    <li> My GF is in beauty school and was telling me about a sock bun that she was wild about I liked it except se was cutting up old socks for her hair... This are a perfect replacement!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, the conpect is great but it didnt work for me. I have long and thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t quite get all the hair to stay. like i said it just didn&#x27;t work for me but it is a good product.</li>
    <li> My order shipped quickly and was well packaged to prevent damage. It was exactly as described. These bun makers work very well! Don&#x27;t bother with any of that as seen on TV or more expensive stuff, just get these. I was worried that these were a scam, too good to be true you know, but the hundred or so positive reviews convinced me. And now I have my own review to add. If you love buns and want to make them the easy way, don&#x27;t delay, order today! (That&#x27;s my own little commercial jingle for this product. I think I have a future in marketing, don&#x27;t you?)</li>
    <li> I have natural afro textured hair. When two-strand twisted, my hair touches my shoulder. The different sizes accommodating me well. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Useless... No way to make a bun with it. Decide to try something else.</li>
    <li> These are very handy to put long hair up into a bun. Would be easier if they had a little instruction page with it.</li>
    <li> no instructions as to how to use them?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair and neither of them would hold my hair up. Would not recommend for those with chest length or longer hair.</li>
    <li> They are alright, but you&#x27;d need to purchase a lot of them as they are not made like the Original Hair Dini.  These are made with simple, thin wires which break easily after repeated bending but when new they do produce the same great affect.  For the price, it&#x27;s worth it until you can obtain the original one.  I can&#x27;t find it :(</li>
    <li> our daughter loves these</li>
    <li> Works great! Pretty buns</li>
    <li> I can make a good bun with this but it pulls my hair a bit.  I found this makes my hair wonderfully wavy by the end of the day and I plan to use these when I have an evening out planned.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all. I&#x27;m used to wearing my hair in the typical donut or sock bun but this product simply does not work. Maybe my hair is too long (bra length) or I just wasn&#x27;t using it right. A friend suggested you tubing a video to figure out how to use it but I didn&#x27;t try that. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Also, the shipping took FOREVER.</li>
    <li> These worked pretty good. I still had to use bobby pins to keep it in place but was easier to use the a lot of others I have tried.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. its great for long hair short hair thin and thick. you just have to learn how to use it. people complain that its doesn&#x27;t hold their hair but it does. and for such a low price i would buy it again</li>
    <li> A ridiculous waste of money. DOES NOT WORK! Very cheap!</li>
    <li> Do not work at all. I don&#x27;t suggest buying these. They suck!</li>
    <li> WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF IT CAME WITH INSTRUCTIONS</li>
    <li> I took one look at these and threw them away. They were cheaply made. I didn&#x27;t use them, so they might work. I usually use hairagmi&#x27;s, which are much more reliable and better made. I thought I scored because of the price but lesson learned. I will stick to hairagami&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I prefer these over traditional bun sponges, which seem fussy and fake to me, and always seem to show through. These are really comfortable, but after using them a few times, they get somewhat misshapen and don&#x27;t clamp tightly. So, they are good, but not very sturdy. I think all of them are about the same, so I&#x27;d recommend finding them as cheap as you can and buying some extras.</li>
    <li> This one is very easy to use and perfect, i comb my hair and simply up-do  it like a hairstylist.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality!  There was excess material not cut off or removed from manufacturing leaving uneven edges and a very poor appearance</li>
    <li> This product was so easy to use.  I put my daughter&#x27;s hair in a pony tail, slipped her hair through the slit in the foam and rolled it up.  There is a wire in the middle of the product to then bend it into a circle.  She had a great looking bun in a few seconds.  I then put a few pins in her hair to hold it in place.  The one thing that would make this product better would be a way to connect both ends after bending it into a circle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get how it worked and directions were too small to read.</li>
    <li> For a heads up, there&#x27;s ONE big curler and ONE small curler. Not FOUR curlers or TWO big or TWO small.</li>
    <li> I like these but it takes time and practice to get used to using them and then it will only take minutes to make a great hairstyle. You can make many different styles with these. The packaging was good and it got to me in the right amout of time. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> They are too big ,but they do work.  Best if you have hair with no layers.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.  They don&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, if you&#x27;re looking for some fun, pretty cheap, hilarious drawings, I&#x27;d check them out just based on the instructional drawings alone.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work like it is supposed to.  I can make a better bun on my own.  It also pulls my hair.</li>
    <li> I really like these they do make it easy to put your hair in a bun the only downside is I have layers in my hair so when I&#x27;m pulling it to the ends to roll up to make the bun I have hairs falling out so it&#x27;s not really recommended if you have a lot of layers in your hair.  My hair is not even long and it still works its just with the layers I have to put some little bit of gel in my hair to make everything stay put but I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m CERTAIN this product is great on shorter hair than mine, but my hair is 3 feet long and thick and it does a mediocre job of holding my hair.  It works, just not as perfectly neat as it would be if my hair were shorter.</li>
    <li> have long thin hair - used small hair dini have not been able to find it - this works better than the hair dini and was 1/8 of the price - wanted something to keep hair up in the heat - will be buying more so i always have on hand</li>
    <li> These are so east to use. I like to use them right after I wash my hair. When I take it down, my hair is very wavy with lots of body. I would order these again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I thought this might be a money saver when my 7 year old e z bun broke. However in this case I got what I paid for, the wire is not very flexible and does not move smoothly through the hair. Maybe if I had never had the original more expensive product I would not be so disappointed in this one.... but I am, just not good quality can not see this standing up to repeated use......</li>
    <li> Great for your hair it makes your bun look real nice, I wear it everyday the larger ones are better</li>
    <li> good for little hair, it make a perfect bun I recommend for little girls too. true to the picture. the shipping din&#x27;t take to long</li>
    <li> Did not work at all for my hair.  I have long curly hair and I originally bought these for use during Army Basic Training.  I tried them out at home and I did not end up bringing them to training with me.  It is much easier and more effective to just twist and wrap my hair into a bun.</li>
    <li> i get these in the mail and was so excited put up my hair as soon as i get them . didnt work with my hair . if you have layers in most of your hair  this doesnt work all that good . also it is a little hard to keep it round when binding it is kind of sharp corners . maybe if you use them the more you use them the better your get . i gave it 3 stars because thay are cheap so i didnt wast to much</li>
    <li> i cant use it i dont know if it is because i have a straight hair, but the instructive is not clear at all.</li>
    <li> It took me a little while to figure it out, but it works pretty well for the price. I have layers in my hair that seem to be making it difficult to keep all of my hair in the thing, but with bobby pins, it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> They bend out of shape way too soon for someone with really long and thick hair.</li>
    <li> i love these my mom and i use them so i like to buy a few packs. they are better than hot buns</li>
    <li> there are no instructions on how to use these things- they certainly don&#x27;t work as well as the photos would have you believe. I&#x27;m at a loss as to what else to do with them!</li>
    <li> It was great. easy to put on and easy to keep on. I love this product. it is great !</li>
    <li> I really loved this product it gave the illusion that I had way more hair then I really plus it was easy to do</li>
    <li> This is cute and easy to use definitely recommend this product and its at a very good price I bought one for me and my cousin and its so easy to use you can use it everyday without struggling</li>
    <li> I personally would not recommend this product unless you have textured hair or have better experience with hair. I always use the donut ring bun former, which is perfect in my super smooth silky hair. When I tried using this product, it left a hole where the two ends meet, so you could tell I had something in my hair. If your hair is more textured/curly, it may be able to cover it better. Or you would probably need to tease and hairspray your hair.</li>
    <li> Great stuff , works perfect and stays on all day...really great for those bad hair days...my daughter has a lot of hair and even worked for her</li>
    <li> Is actually a good product. It forms your hair into a perfect circle bun. Only problem was there&#x27;s no way to really make it stay together, I had trouble getting it to hold right. It needs a snap clip or something because it separates. But if you don&#x27;t mind wearing a crap ton of Bobbi pins then it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Sorry, I don&#x27;t find that these hold up in my long, curly hair.  It is really unfortunate because I was super excited about this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these and another type, upon opening this one it seemed o take more effort than the other so i have not used yet. The regular donut doest require the bending and mess but i guess once you get the hang of it you can do with your eyes closed....</li>
    <li> My hair is super long, (past my waist) and they still work great on my hair, I love them, i&#x27;ve even fallen asleep in them and they&#x27;re still in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> Literally gives you the ability to get a perfect &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; bun in 10 seconds flat or a perfect ballerina bun in 15!!</li>
    <li> It good for a quick hair style, just make sure you add the hair pin after you have spread the hair around. I learned about this from YouTube and it works</li>
    <li> Doesnt work for me at all. cheaply made and does not hold my hair. useless. u get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> it is just a junk.&lt;br /&gt;it can not keep the hair tightly.&lt;br /&gt;how can we keep it as the picture shows??</li>
    <li> Cheap--took forever to get to me....never use them...sorry I bought them. Spend more money and get the better clips...they don&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold at all for my hair and I don&#x27;t even have thick hair. It fell out multiple times and Ithink is very cheap product</li>
    <li> Does not hold up extremely thick hair. Looks like it might work on thin hair.</li>
    <li> I could never get these to work correctly. I have used them to curl my hair. I simply wrap my damp hair in the tool and leave it to dry (typically overnight). When I wake I remove them and have nice curls.</li>
    <li> Was expecting better quality, but for the price I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Horrible not what I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Just as described and got here quick!</li>
    <li> it came with absolutely no instructions.</li>
    <li> Save your time and money and get something else. These are very cheap material and do not work. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> works better if you have thin med leanth hair.</li>
    <li> This worked for my daughter but I guess my hair is too long or I have too much because my bun kept sliding out or falling to one side</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this thing is terrible.  First, the holes weren&#x27;t cut through. I damaged one of the 3- yes 3 NOT 4 of the hair pieces trying to cut out the holes.  It took forever to arrive, and the large ones don&#x27;t work on long hair- it just tangled it into a mess.  There was no packaging with instructions either- not even in Chinese. Just a defective product in a plastic bag.  My hair is half-way (maybe an inch more?) between my shoulders and the small of my back.</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly. But you get what you pay for, the wire is very thin and does not hold thick hair...which I have.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but I know they&#x27;re going to work perfectly👌. Tho I didn&#x27;t get two small ones.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work on a child that has a LOT of hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve very long hair and these did not work well for me. My hair got badly tangled after each attempt to use them. I could never make it work for me...too bad :(</li>
    <li> these came without instructions and no mater what I did it didn&#x27;t make a good looking bun on my shoulder lenght thinner hair.</li>
    <li> The metal this hair accessory is made of is too flimsy so it does not hold its form. Unfortunately there is no way you can make a bun or even put your hair up using it!</li>
    <li> The whole idea if these is awesome, but they don&#x27;t really hold your hair. I have longer hair with a few layers and it was a heck of a time trying to get it to roll and once I got it to look the way I wanted it, all bun shaped and what not, I had to load my head with bobby pins so it would stay in place and not separate. If you want a &amp;#34;cheater&amp;#34;, easier way of making that perfect bun, just get one of those chignon foam things that are already shaped and you just tuck and pin. Much more secure.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really work on mine or my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Wish this came with instructions.  Still trying to figure out how to use it.  My girls are excited to make those &amp;#34;cool looking&amp;#34; buns.</li>
    <li> I would recommend using the larger one for thicker hair.  It makes a larger bun.  I found this product very easy to use.  It only took me 3 times to get it right, which, for a non-hair stylist, is good!</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t like this clips. They really don&#x27;t hold the hair that good and to do a semi decent bun some has to do for you. To do it yourself, they not really that good.</li>
    <li> Not as good a quality as I would have liked.  I feel the wire inside will break quickly, as I have just used it a couple of times I feel the change in wire strength.  Wish a instruction guide was included.</li>
    <li> In love with the way it handles my thick long hair</li>
    <li> Gave this a try and figured it was a waste of money. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to secure the bun together after wrapping the hair down. I figured it out (squeezed the two ends together so they were overlapping and it stayed in place all day). I wear sock buns all the time and no more -- I&#x27;m a convert to this device. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but it doesn&#x27;t come in blonde. I really wish there were other colors. I have just below shoulder length hair with some long layers. I used the smaller bun maker (despite having a ton of hair, the dark color is just too hard to hide with my very light blonde hair).</li>
    <li> I like that there are 2 sizes in this product. It is also nice since it makes dressing up your hair styles easy</li>
    <li> Once I got the hang of the it, it was great.  It looked so good and it kept their hair out of their faces for school.</li>
    <li> The sock bun is sooo much easier. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Not as easy at looks. The instructions how to use the product. I am hoping I can find some instructions online.</li>
    <li> These do absolutely nothing for my long thick hair if I want to make a bun. However, they make the best overnight curls with very little prep time. It&#x27;s also not as uncomfortable to sleep on as many overnight curls. Just make a &amp;#34;bun mohawk&amp;#34; with damp hair and sleep on it. If this doesn&#x27;t make sense look for &amp;#34;letsmakeitup1&amp;#34; on youtube and her heatless curls tutorial.</li>
    <li> This product is probably good for people with thicker hair.  My hair does not look like the pictures when I use it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me or my two daughters. But it was cheap and I wanted to give it a try.</li>
    <li> They smell so bad that I didn&#x27;t want to wear them.</li>
    <li> i love using the sponge for the ballerina buns. its easy to use, and stays in place. i never have to redo my hair.</li>
    <li> Great item. Love them! Work great in my hair, use them all the time too, thanks much for them! Would buy agian</li>
    <li> There was no receipt with the package. It didn&#x27;t make a bun shape and it does not work with long hair.</li>
    <li> These are okay but somewhat difficult to roll your hair into. You cannot latch it like it claims you can so easy without securing it with bobby pins or a hair tie but other that that it does help you make your bun.</li>
    <li> Unfortunetely it does not support my hair, too weak!</li>
    <li> First of all they do not make cute buns at all. There is no way to hide the black end in your hair, but I&#x27;ve repurposed them. After I blow out my hair, I put my hair in 2-3 tight buns (princess lela style) and heat them up real well with my drier and let them cool for 15-30 mins. After I take them out; I get great body and depth in my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair. I have very thin hair with lots of layers but it makes my hair look perfect regardless of my baby hair fly aways. Whenever I use it, I always get compliments. Much easier to use the the circle bun makers.</li>
    <li> Not long enough to hold thick hair</li>
    <li> I only got one size and 2 of them. Work well though.</li>
    <li> the only thing is it might not withstand an entire day if you have think hair, it doesn&#x27;t fasten or anything to secure the hold. it is soft and does work as explained</li>
    <li> It is just wat i needed. Fits perfectly whith diferentes lengths of hear and different haircuts. The y William be very useful for the everyday</li>
    <li> they work great  but you should make them in silk it would be easier on the hair. but it does the job. for so cheap thanks</li>
    <li> Yep. It was cheap but not even worth the $2 I paid for them. Threw them in the trash. Made of foam and you have to tear a hole in it to pull hair through. Worthless</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to use! Love the way my bun looks in these. Very tight and professional. I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would work on my shoulder-length hair, but they do.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in my daughters hair. Cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it works and it&#x27;s easy to use. This product really works for long hair too.</li>
    <li> I really love these! They hold my hair in a bun all day. There is no tugging on my hair and they are super lightweight so you forget that you have it in your hair. The reason for it only getting 4 stars is because when I take it out, some hair gets stuck in the foam and it rips that hair that is caught, out.</li>
    <li> These are amazing I use them almost everyday when I want a perfect bun!!!</li>
    <li> its cool i just have a ton of hair so i wont use them that much but its a great product, got here on time, and great prices</li>
    <li> This is something you definitely have to practice with to learn how to use and create different hair styles.  If in need of ideas, visit youtube.com for ideas (copy/paste the product name in the search box), there&#x27;s not much info shown on the video but who knows, maybe more styles can come out of this.  GREAT idea for hair.</li>
    <li> She likes it, it was cheaper than what we could buy locally, even with shipping, what more can a dad ask for?</li>
    <li> holds up my thin hair like nothing, I have tried so many things and nothing would hold up my thin hair, this holds  it up and makes it look so pretty. I gave my friend the two large ones for her thick hair and she love them!!</li>
    <li> Still gave it 5 stars cuz I don&#x27;t think it is the products fault as much as it is my hairs?</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, and this is just foam around some wire. However it does the job right! If you have longer, heavier hair, just put ones hair in a pony tail first and it works just fine!</li>
    <li> This works on long hair. I purchased another and it did not work on waist length hair. This works! It&#x27;s easy to use and I believe will last provided you use this on dry hair. I recommend this for long haired ppl who haven&#x27;t been able to achieve the perfect bun with other products. Slip your hair through the middle and start rolling at your ends. It hold as well (I slept in my bun and it was there in the morning)!</li>
    <li> Cant get it to work for me at all. Only bought it because it was cheap and didnt want to spend my money.</li>
    <li> they are not EZbun, but they will do.  Sturdy, foam, comfortable, I use them to keep my hair out of my face while I sleep, and when I get up my hair is all wavy!</li>
    <li> very quick shipping, just as described</li>
    <li> Looks really great once on, good for adults not for girls</li>
    <li> Very very thin and not sturdy enough for the hair</li>
    <li> The idea for these is awesome but this one is poorly made. They dont stay tight when looped together.</li>
    <li> These are so much easier to use than the mesh donut looking things.  I enjoy using them, but again I am such a perfectionist and I have to do it a few times before I get it just right.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok. I use it to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; my hair. Sometimes I slept with it, didn&#x27;t bother me much... next morning it turn out pretty.</li>
    <li> I got these cause they were so cheap but they don&#x27;t come with any instructions so I have no idea how to use them. Have had them for a few months now and haven&#x27;t used once.</li>
    <li> I have fine/thin hair, so maybe it&#x27;s just me. These would work very well for someone with thicker hair. They just need something to hold onto. You can feel the wire inside clearly (in a cheap kind of way), and it&#x27;s not enough to stay in place without the addition of bobby pins or spray. When I put it in, it loosened within an hour. I traded them to a friend for a hair donut.</li>
    <li> If I could give it no stars I would. If you have thick long hair, these will not work. No grip at all, doesn&#x27;t stay closed when you fold it, it went straight to the trash.</li>
    <li> It reeks of a chemical smell once I opened the package. I didn&#x27;t want to put it on my hair so I waited until the smell is gone. I can&#x27;t rate how well it works because the smell is still there.</li>
    <li> these work great! no flying hair or having to roll/unroll a few times to get it right (i had the plastic roll &amp; hook band before) i just did a quick donut bun before writing my review here and hair was up in a nice bun in a matter of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that said.. you also have to be wary if you have layered hair.. you will have hair stick out here and there but nothing a few bobby pins can&#x27;t fix.. and if you have thick hair try using the bigger sponge to accommodate the volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;delivery was prompt (arrived before estimated delivery date) though i wished it was better packaged. i had expected it to be a plastic bag/cover of some sort and unbent but they were bent in half and stuffed in an envelope.. though not a big issue i wished it wasn&#x27;t bent because now i can feel a visible crease in the metal. but overall, i&#x27;m a happy purchaser!</li>
    <li> These are so handy for people like me who are style challenged...I have never been able to do a bun ever since I was a young woman...but, I can now!  These hairstyling tools are awesome.  Don&#x27;t know what I would do without them.  Great buy for the money!!</li>
    <li> Do not waste money on these. Do not work whatsoever, not even sure how they could possibly stay in anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re better off buying the cloth ones with snaps. I didn&#x27;t like these at all.</li>
    <li> Not worth buying and the wait! It literally has no grip or hold up to it&#x27;s name. Really disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. Good tool. Would not recommend for heavy or too long of hair as your hair will be too much for the twist to hold. Other than that, great product!</li>
    <li> arrived as promised great deal</li>
    <li> honestly...had a really hard time figuring out how to use this and gave up.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, past bra line, curly, layered, so this product didn&#x27;t work very well for me. They&#x27;re nice but not made for thick hair, I ended up giving them all to my Mom, she loves them, easy use for her.</li>
    <li> I may not know how to use it, if they are going to sell it they should include or post how to use it. It&#x27;s hard to get results you wanted using this product</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.. They are very flimsy and poorly made. I have thin hair and they won&#x27;t even hold up my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair is very heavy and it will work but it takes some time to get it in right,</li>
    <li> It makes a bun . You will need another rubberband or hair bow to keep it in place but overall does the job. Works good enough for the price.</li>
    <li> Does not stay in your hair and to even attempt too, you have to somehow clip the ends together</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even know how to close the two ends together. the item is so bulky by the way, how to hide it inside the hairs???</li>
    <li> I have been using hairgami for up-style hair however it sometimes annoys me when the elastic band keeps rolling itself before I roll my hair. Well this one is better with that. It stays straight until you shape it. The problem is, it is not that strong. It holds your hair however it is just a medium firm. It is not as strong as ring buns. Anyway with that price, I do not regret the purchase and I will tell my long hair friends to get it. It is still convenient and quick to complete your up-style hair.</li>
    <li> These sponge rollers are so much easier to use than a sock! The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars instead of 5, is that there is no snap or clip on the end of the roller to keep it in a circular shape. This makes it particularly hard to bobby pin to your head without it falling out. Other than that, the sponge rollers work great! Not bad for the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I have hip length fine  hair and bought these to help make neater buns and add a little volume.  However, my hair is so long, there is no support and my hair falls with this. I think it would work on medium thick hair and hair that is about shoulder length.</li>
    <li> This is terrible!  First, the 2 sides are stuck together.  Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t even stay in your hair.  Third, it ends up making you look like a hot mess.  Do not buy, it was a waste of money ad I ended up throwing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Love it ive had them for a while and still looks like new . Would definitely would buy it again</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who loves to try different hairstyles.  She has used the larger one on her thicker long hair, and tried the smaller one on my shorter thinner hair, and both worked great. The foam holds the hair nice and tight and if any hair was falls out, she just used a couple of bobbypins to keep it tucked in.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with these very cheap and the foam comes off easy. The store shipped fast and on time I just don&#x27;t like the product.</li>
    <li> Love these! They really help get my hair in to an easy bun.</li>
    <li> I originally got these because the low price was very attractive to me and I wanted to try them out. After wearing them in for a night, I got really crimpy curls so I guess they worked, but I personally really did not like the way they turned out. I guess another thing just might be how naturally straight my hair is.</li>
    <li> Disappointing, to say the least. When I purchased these, I had long, thick hair that was all one length. In theory, the perfect hair for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Nope. No matter how I twisted or rolled, these didn&#x27;t hold AND there was always some sort of foam showing.&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, they took over a month to arrive.</li>
    <li> Granted these were only a little over $1 but the metal wire is so stiff inside them you really can&#x27;t do much with them and the foam feels like it&#x27;s gong to rip if you try to maneuver them into a position that might actually hold you hair.  Waste of time.  Spend some more money and get some decent ones.</li>
    <li> very flexible and lots of ways to fix my hair with it. Very easy to use. I love it :)</li>
    <li> For $1.08 I am so excited lol....I didn&#x27;t expect to get 4 pieces! The real reason I purchased these is to curl my hair. I had them a long time ago and if I wrapped my hair with it when it was damp and went to bed with it, I woke up with beautiful full curls that last all day, sometimes even 2 days. If I use a curling iron, my hair stays curly for only like an hour. I highly recommend this product....loooooooovvvvve it!!!</li>
    <li> I would have given this product a 5 star rating except that it arrived with no directions. Fortunately, other Amazon client reviews revealed what I needed to know. As a former military woman, I was encouraged by the other military women&#x27;s reviews to purchase this. Recommend this be marketed to the military. As a civilian, it&#x27;s fun to wear a fashionable messy bun that remains secure and lightweight .</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hides in hair well.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than what is selling in stores for a bun clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No instructions on how to use them.</li>
    <li> I remember having one when i was little and i loved it. These are not as high quality but the price more than makes up for that. One thing i will say is if you have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s long, it may not hold as well because the wires bend a bit easier.Otherwise a great product.</li>
    <li> This makes the perfect sock bun without the sock! Literally takes me less than a minute to roll it up and squeeze it closed. I love it.</li>
    <li> item is exactly as pictured. works for what i needed it for. glad i found these at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I just got these and I have to say, I&#x27;ll probably stick with my old sock, they do not wotk for me, I have a lot of long fine hair and it seems to be too heavy for the sponge clip. It is just a very thin wire and a soft sponge wrapped around..I tried to put it oin twice and one of the tips was already cutting through the sponge. It is not expensive so if you want to try it go ahead and order it, its just not what I expected at all.</li>
    <li> Product was smaller then I thought it would be. Hard to use if you have thick long hair. But good for shorter thinner hair.</li>
    <li> These are way to difficult for me to figure out. I tried to watch a YouTube video with directions and it didn&#x27;t make it any clearer.</li>
    <li> These are poor quality and don&#x27;t work at all. They don&#x27;t hold the hair well and are really hard to clasp together. They are basically just stiff metal with a really cheap foam covering. A total waste of money - they come from somewhere overseas and maybe they are a cheap copy of a product that does work.</li>
    <li> Love this! It works to get a perfect donut bun. Heard about it from Bebexo on Youtube. She does a lot of cool hair designs.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about trying this product, especially with all the rave reviews online and in recent magazines. My hair is just past my shoulders and has some layers. Clearly after trying this product several times, I&#x27;m convinced that you need to have much longer hair in order for it to work. My hair is too short and/or has too many shorter layers and thus there&#x27;s not enough hair to wrap around the sponge. It did look cool with the hair that was able to be wrapped up, but too much of my hair just couldn&#x27;t make it into the sponge/clip. I&#x27;m very adept at putting up my own hair with pins so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll stick to for now. However, if you have long hair, this could really work well for you.</li>
    <li> cheap, easy to use - wished it came with info sheet on various styles one could make with the different size formers.</li>
    <li> While working in the kitchen my wife always found it uncomfortable to leave her hair loose or tie it up in a pony tail. She wanted something to hold her hair in a bun and placed an order for 4pcs of Magic foam sponge clip hair styling donut bun. It arrived in a week&#x27;s time and she was so glad. Now she is able to hold her hair in a tight bun with the help of the magic foam. It comes in 2 sizes large and small. So convenient that even my daughter uses to tie here hair. My wife says that with little creativity the foam can work wonders for party hairdo as well.</li>
    <li> This little piece of wire wrapped with industrial foam might work great for thin or short hair, but it couldn&#x27;t handle my curls. The big clip wasn&#x27;t strong enough to hold all my hair, and barely strong enough for half of it. The foam snagged terribly (I lost quite a bit of hair untangling myself from this thing, and nearly couldn&#x27;t get it out at all), and I&#x27;m concerned at how flimsy the wire inside feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my homemade sock bun. If you&#x27;ve got thick hair, or it&#x27;s longer than shoulder-length, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting your time or money on these clips.</li>
    <li> Love these! Hold lots of thick hair up very easily! Also very comfortable like you don&#x27;t have anything in your hair!</li>
    <li> Arrived quick. Easy to use and love to have two different sizes in this package.</li>
    <li> Waste of money and it is so not easy to use. At drug stores are much cheaper and better. Suck</li>
    <li> I just receive the product but it is four foam for make-up.... Anyway, I have to purchase again because I really need it...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked as a hairdresser I spent many days creating perfect buns but it was difficult to get it perfect on myself. In a matter of seconds I am able to produce a professional bun with these</li>
    <li> Worked great and I loved that there were no extra pieces like some donut buns have (like extra bobby pins). It was simple to do.</li>
    <li> Not meant for thick hair. Had a hard time trying to connect to two end. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This donut bun maker works amazing. It&#x27;s almost like magic. I am able to make a cute hairstyle in just seconds due to this foam sponge clip.</li>
    <li> To me these don&#x27;t hold my hair at all</li>
    <li> You get these bun formers with out the directions, I have no idea how to use them...I am sure I can find something online, however it would have been nice if they came with it.</li>
    <li> i love it. the instructions in chinesse were a little confusing how ever, but after failed attempts i figured it out</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with any instructions on how to make this thing work, and my daughter wanted me to do a bun in her hair.  I struggled to get this to work properly and eventually replaced it with a different product that was just a donut shaped sponge which worked much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps someone else would have more experience with this and would know exactly how to make it work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I had a hair product like this a few years ago and always loved it. I was so happy to see these clips in amazon and am very happy with my new clips.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several of these for my daughter to use during studio dance as well as dance team performances.  The bun maker is very easy to use and my daughter can put her own bun in now!&lt;br /&gt;I recently ordered a set for every dancer on the team (because they love how the buns look when using this sponge bun maker!).</li>
    <li> I can wear my hair up now. I don&#x27;t have to go to the salon anymore for an up do.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my hair because my hair is thick. It may work on thinner hair. on my hair most of the hair just pops out. I am giving it 3 stars because its not their fault my hair is thick :)</li>
    <li> These are ok...i was looking for a large maybe extra large one since i have so much hair and i wanted a giant bun.but can be great if you not looking for a giant one</li>
    <li> This is not good for thick hair. The wire is too weak to hold my hair, and the holder is small too.</li>
    <li> I love this twist holder clip for my hair. My hair isn&#x27;t real long but it clips just fine and is better than rubber bands. You can wear the bun twister anywhere. I even wear it to bed and it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how to use these things since there are no directions. I guess I will just experiment and try to figure it out.</li>
    <li> Good things&lt;br /&gt;1. I received the package in 15 days though the estimated delivery dates were close to a month.&lt;br /&gt;2. It was nicely packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad things&lt;br /&gt;1. I only got one in the mail - i emailed the company and hope they resend me the missing piece. (I&#x27;ll update my review again).&lt;br /&gt;2. The piece which i received is approximately 8&#x27;&#x27; long (but the wire would be about 2cm less smaller than that). I am having medium long hair(little above my waise line) with good volume and it doesnt hold my hair properly.</li>
    <li> not what I was expecting</li>
    <li> bad quality, the long one after 2 uses lost the form</li>
    <li> I like having something that&#x27;s more hidden and makes my hair look more kept than when I put it up in a rubber band. My hair is too long to just let it hang, so I have to fold it in the rubber band. This gives me a nice bun, but it&#x27;s not as easy to use as it looks. Practice does make perfect with this. After a few times, it&#x27;s a lot easier to use.  I&#x27;m always looking for quick and easy as well. I don&#x27;t spend more than 2 minutes wrapping up my hair in the morning to get ready for my 9-to-5.</li>
    <li> Daughter used these and was awesome  took a little time but got it</li>
    <li> I have thin hair so it is hit and miss if stuff like this actually work with my hair.  These are very simple but they actually worked!</li>
    <li> it isnt much of a size difference... but overall good product.</li>
    <li> Wish these would clasp together, or keep the bun pinned down somewhat. a few bobby pins do the trick, but i wish it was included somehow.&lt;br /&gt;i have thick hair, can&#x27;t use the small ones at all for a full bun.</li>
    <li> Does not hold hair well at all. Not even fine straight hair. It looks good for a minute and then falls off.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick thick hair and these have a hard time keeping up with the weight, but it&#x27;s a good way to get a nice bun started if you use extra pins to secure.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my hair up 😕</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for hair with layers! It is so complicated to try and work with. The material isn&#x27;t durable either. It is a very thin plastic with foam on top.</li>
    <li> These won&#x27;t hold your hair up.</li>
    <li> Flimsy and cheap compared to the Hairdini, which is what I was tyrying to replace it for. Within 2 uses the metal starting poking through the foam since it split up the side.</li>
    <li> For the price -- less than $2.00 for the set -- these are a good deal.  They are thinner than the one I used before, but are less than half the price.  I don&#x27;t expect them to last very long since the foam will fray at the edges, but for price, I&#x27;ll just buy more.</li>
    <li> Holds my bun all day!</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It actually makes a cute bun!</li>
    <li> These are very easy to use and saves a lot of time when you want to wear your hair up</li>
    <li> I recieved this item 2 weeks before the estimated delivery date, so that&#x27;s always a bonus. I have long thick hair and these worked great. Extremely easy to use, I don&#x27;t know why you will need instructions. I put it up super quick and got a big full beautiful bun. I prefer these vs the donuts.</li>
    <li> didnt find it easy to use. will not recommend to buy.. i preffer the doughnut..chipped as described, affordable, looks durable,</li>
    <li> The product has a good concept but fails to deliver. It&#x27;s poorly made with cheap material. You get what you pay for is what came to my mind. I think the concept was good...... but the clips were too short. This would only work well for those who have really long hair and lots of volume. Unfortunately, that wan&#x27;t me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. I say I have some pretty easy hair to work with but this would just not stay. I have no volume to my hair yet I could not close the circle without all of my hair falling out.</li>
    <li> Took a couple tries to get this to work, but eventually was able to get a very sleek donut bun hairdo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that the description says 2 large and 2 small were going to be sent, and I only received 2 large. Decided not to make a big deal since it was so cheap anyway. But not impressed with only receiving half my order.</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets and somehow wound up with four of the small ones. I have waist length hair, so that wasn&#x27;t a good start. I planned to use them to make four small buns, but they don&#x27;t hold the hair well. It didn&#x27;t matter if I turned them under or over, as soon as you let go, they loosen up and just hang off of your head. Hoped it would work similar to a Hairgami, but it didn&#x27;t. They also don&#x27;t bend sharply when you try to bend the circle to make them a bun. Doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work its a waste of money doesn&#x27;t come with instructions but it doesn&#x27;t make a byn just a mess horrible product</li>
    <li> I wish I loved this product and that it worked for my hair, but it didn&#x27;t and I don&#x27;t. It ended up being too flimsy and small for my hair, and could not keep all of my hair up. I&#x27;m not talking small strands that stick out from layering, but about half my of hair didn&#x27;t stay put at all.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately even the small holders are too big for my hair.  It takes much arranging to cover the black holder with my blond hair.  Not worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a great item hold hair very firmly. But am concerned about how long it will last. It is not made out of lasting material but is a good item to use.</li>
    <li> Thanks for sending me this product that I really liked ... I recommend it to everyone for being excellent and very good quality</li>
    <li> They were super cute - but because of the plastic bits inside - and the twisting motions - the plastic pieces broke.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 items but you only sent me one,and the product is not good it can&#x27;t even be opened</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s almost unavailable to make your hairs stay in place with this stuff!! waste of money! I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like them. I actually find these bun makers very useful with a little help from bobby pins :) It&#x27;s best if you don&#x27;t have a lot of short layers for your hair because once you create the bun, the hair tends to stick up. I have used both sizes and they work fine for me.</li>
    <li> I have long straight fairly thin hair and it can barely hold my hair. Waste of money. Don&#x27;t bother buying.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work the way I&#x27;ve expected it to be.</li>
    <li> waste of money! I wish I would have bought it from somewhere closer because I would have totally return it!</li>
    <li> Not a great product. It did not work for my wife. the delivery was quick but overall the quality is not upto the mark. Some may argue that its cheap but better qulity goods are availalble at the same price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned other bun twister tools.  These were absolutely useless, though, and I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money on them.</li>
    <li> I love these things; ordering more; I love them and can&#x27;t live without them and think they are awesome and work really well.</li>
    <li> I have thick long hair and it didn&#x27;t work at all for me. The metal wire becomes flimsy after multiple uses and can poke through the sponge. Don&#x27;t recommend for users with thick and/or long hair</li>
    <li> I have watched videos on this and honestly, I&#x27;m still not entirely sure what I&#x27;m supposed to do with this.  I usually just end up with a tangled mess.</li>
    <li> Nope not good doesn&#x27;t even close properly so it does not keep my hair up in any way shape or form...</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t really easy to use. It definitely took me some practice- scratch that- a lot of practice in order to try to get these to work for me. I don&#x27;t know if it is just my hair texture and thickness but it didn&#x27;t really work that well for me, and I don&#x27;t really have thick hair. However, when they do work, my hair looks cute! My friend was able to get it to work for her wavier hair, so it seems that more textured hair works better with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good note though is that these shipped out suuuuuuuper quickly! Like, I got it like 2 or 3 weeks earlier than the predicted shipping date :)</li>
    <li> Good thing it was so cheap to buy, it keeps you from being too upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for me at all...tried on my daughter several times and her hair is really straight, no luck, just won&#x27;t say like it should.&lt;br /&gt;We had better luck with the cut sock, rolling method !!!!  You tube it and save your money.  :/</li>
    <li> These work great, very affordable... my hair is very long and VERY thick and it will hold it up and in place with only 2-3 bobby pins for 7-8 hours with minimal hair spray.</li>
    <li> I love them so much it work for well for hair</li>
    <li> We did not know how to use it and still do not.  It would have been nice to have instructions.</li>
    <li> only got one in the pack . its says set of 2 . it is a great product. wish i got 2 of them</li>
    <li> I have long hair so it&#x27;s kind of tricky, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to last me forever but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as a means to creating that perfect \\&quot;donut\\&quot; bun, but using these, I can&#x27;t seem to get it to look uniformly round. Looks rather misshapen and not very pretty. It does hold my hair up, but I had to pull my hair up in a ponytail secured with an elastic before rolling it in this thing to keep it up. The product is rather cheap looking - but what do you expect for $1.17 for a set of 4? I wouldn&#x27;t wear this outside of home, but it does help create amazing volume and curl for my fine, long, straight hair! My hair will NOT hold curl. But after I wash my hair, and roll my hair up in these little foam things, and let my hair finish drying, I have AMAZING, super easy to achieve curls that all day! YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a lovely donut bun that&#x27;s super easy and FREE - check out a \\&quot;How to Create a Sock Bun\\&quot; video on YouTube. You&#x27;ll be really glad you did!</li>
    <li> This is a gift. I haven&#x27;t tried it myself, but it looks ok. The person I gave it to was happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal, these bun formers can go for 8 dollars at stores.  I also have a ton of hair, so the big size works great. And surprisingly, it stays in my hair!</li>
    <li> There is no paper directions to tell you how to use and the ones on home pageare poor description on how to make a perfect bun</li>
    <li> I think this works better on longer hair. I tried to put the small one in my hair and it still didn&#x27;t work. it was hard to get my hair through the hole and it doesn&#x27;t cover my hair. not for shorter hair people. my hair is almost BSL but this still doesn&#x27;t work with my hair.​</li>
    <li> There were no instructions on how to use this product, just showed up loose in an envelope.  Tried to find youtube videos on how to use it and it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Usually a loyal hairigami fan, but this was more difficult.</li>
    <li> It was very easy to use looks good and it got here 2 weeks before it said it was :)</li>
    <li> they dont really keep their shape when you use them. i guess my hairs just too heavy for it? probably wont be using them</li>
    <li> You would need to practice with it a bit. I just cut my hair into a pixie so right now it is useless. been using it on my sister. a bit slippery so make sure you spray a bit of hairspray to give it a bit of texture.</li>
    <li> love these it makes doing my hair quick and easy!! with these donut buns i can make a classy updo in seconds</li>
    <li> It really works. Fast and easy. Stays inallday</li>
    <li> The theory behind these are good...just kinda tough to do. Had to practice and work on this for quite a while.  But does have beautiful results.</li>
    <li> The foam is chinzy looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 13 and I love this it&#x27;s so easy all you need is a hair bow and a bobby pin so easy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always putting my hair up. These are a perfect way to do that.</li>
    <li> Quality was a bit better than I had expected but the foamy part of these is a little thick and bulky I find. I have finer, light hair so that&#x27;s maybe just a personal issue. I did try these on a friend though who has thick brown hair, and even though they blended better, they struggled to keep up the weight of her hair. I didn&#x27;t spend a lot on these so I don&#x27;t have much reason to complain. They gave a nice tight bun and it was easy to pin back loose strands. I do highly recommend you style these for someone though and/or have someone do it for you as it&#x27;s a bit of a struggle to do it alone.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and it works perfectly. She has very long hair and it holds up. Recently she cut it and now uses clip in and this hair accessorie works just as well. 2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> These were far too short. My hair is very fine and these were not long enough to wrap around and make a bun. It makes a half-circle but the ends don&#x27;t meet to make a bun and my hair isn&#x27;t even thick.</li>
    <li> Great grip.  Awesome stylish tool.  I would highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;See the online tutorials and it will be even easier to style your hair</li>
    <li> I love these things...I keep buying them over and over again.  They are inexpensive and easy to use.  I&#x27;ve given away a bunch of them...</li>
    <li> The bun maker is so hard to transform your hair into a donut shape. I guess the price you pay match the quality.</li>
    <li> Still having a hard time getting this to work in my hair. It seems to be made well and has held up to numerous attempts to use it.</li>
    <li> They really light and easy to use you can use it for yourself or for your teenagers  is really fun to have them!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to curl my hair without heat and it works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I love it! My hair is way too thick to make a bun with it but that&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a big fan of this , I like the donut bun better much easier &amp; more put together .</li>
    <li> They are literally foam like old lady curlers and wire... the wire pokes through the second you try and use them. I would never buy this product again !</li>
    <li> Great for thin hair!! Thick hair-Not so much!!  They were very Fragile..thin wires holding&lt;br /&gt;Foam up!! Thin hair-its Great!</li>
    <li> These are great. It makes an easy, cool bun in minutes with minimal work. You really do get 2 sets of both sizes. I have medium-long length hair and now I use the larger size. When I bought these a few months ago, I used the smaller size. I have thin hair that&#x27;s all the same length. A co-worker complimented them and I encouraged her to try one to see if she liked it on her. She had multiple layers so it didn&#x27;t stay up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent price for a very good product.</li>
    <li> I thought I would get two different sizes. They are both the same size. I have medium length hair and I thought these were a little bit to long.</li>
    <li> Actually works to make the bun.  But the best part was when I removed it I had lovely waves that hubby loved</li>
    <li> These look like the original, but the wire inside is lacking.  The foam rubber is very thin and collapses to much.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not for a girl that is active. It falls out very easily and it doesn&#x27;t bend together all that well. I still had to bobby pin my daughters hair. I have like my daughter, long hair so I tried it in my hair. It lasted longer in my hair but it only stayed in for a short time. I do like the twist holder but maybe for something a bit more formal.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair with a perm that is several months old in it.  I had seen on the internet where someone put their hair up in one of these when it was damp and had some curls when it dried and they took it down.  I slept in it last night (foam, so it&#x27;s not uncomfortable), and this morning when I took my hair down, I had wavy curls.  Beats the stuffing out of using the curling iron for curls that don&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> great product at excellent price. You can put in hair for an hour and then take down and have pretty curls.</li>
    <li> Not cleanly cut. Can&#x27;t use one of them.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy, doesn&#x27;t hold hair. Doesn&#x27;t make a cute bun... Do not waste your money, plus it takes forever to receive them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for crap. Get an extra large if available, because this adds no volume to your hair, and sticks out awkwardly.</li>
    <li> it doesnt work for long sick hair!!! Too short to twist!!! Didn&#x27;t meet expectation!!! do not hold hair!!! would not recommend</li>
    <li> it was a piece of crap compared to what it said it was.. waste of money.. shouldn&#x27;t buy ever, never ever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of &amp;#34;sock bun&amp;#34; hair products, but this one is real easy to use!  Bun stays on pretty tight all day with the help of a few bobby pins and a hair tie to keep it secure.  Highly recommend this product for people who are on the go and have no time to their own hair..like me.  :-)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t actually work with my course kinky hair. I did not know how to use it exactly, thought it would be easy to use but it&#x27;s actually more difficult than I thought!</li>
    <li> love this thing, saves me at least 20 minutes and I look cute with minimal effort, and I have several sizes.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it properly???  Item arrived as expected with NO scratches, tears, problems, or hassles. Great transaction. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well.  Very cheaply built, but you get your money&#x27;s worth, especially since it comes with 2 of them.  Makes a reasonable bun with little effort.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and even more cheaply made - its a VERY thin, soft, spongy material wrapped around wire.  Does not work at all - tried on my hair, my daughters - don&#x27;t waste your money, esp. if you are a DIYer you can just make it yourself!</li>
    <li> Wow this dont work please dont buy them ! Im very dissapointed on what I bought and mad because this dont make a nice big bun like I wanted !</li>
    <li> I love these...so easy to use even for someone like me. Very comfortable to use with no pulling like the plastic kind.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the product, it&#x27;s me who needs to know how to use it.</li>
    <li> Bought it because it was super cheap and product came as advertised but I have no idea on how to use it. The instructions are not very clear.</li>
    <li> One set was supposed to be longer. I got both short.</li>
    <li> These were extremely hard to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair and bent out of shape easily I never could get it to make a round bun it always came out mishapen and you could see the thing thru her hair plus the directions were in Japanese</li>
    <li> No they were to small they won&#x27;t hold</li>
    <li> They came wat earlier then expected and this is my second time buyin things like these and the only reason y is cuz my family member thru one of them away thinkin it was trash but overall they work pretty well if u put them on rite, hot buns are good too but they hurt</li>
    <li> Thes work perfectly for creating a smooth, perfect bun and are super easy to use!</li>
    <li> I was expecting one big and 1 small and got 2 small :(</li>
    <li> Definitely cheap! It doesn&#x27;t hold tight on my head. Its very loose and you can still see this. Hair doesn&#x27;t cover it completely.</li>
    <li> My hair is short so it&#x27;s difficult for me to get those perfect beautiful buns, and this has been my savior! It&#x27;s quick and easy I am loving this tool!</li>
    <li> These do not work like the video I saw. They do not stay bent at all.</li>
    <li> great tool to use to create a cool hairdo</li>
    <li> very useful thing as for the buns and also as a curler, soft enough to wear it overnight, and have nice, heat free, curls in the morning!</li>
    <li> Loveeeeeeee this especially as a hair stylist!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the summer of 2013 hoping to keep my hair up.I really have long hair but these just didn&#x27;t cut it.Sorry but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase mine off of amazon, but I have to say that this is by far the best hair bun holder I have ever used. I have very long hair so only the long one works for me. I have used the donut ones in the past and they didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants a cute bun in a matter of seconds. :)</li>
    <li> This item was a &amp;#34;throwback&amp;#34; for me, and it did not work like the old ones did. These are foam pieces of garbage...that&#x27;t right where they all went after trying to use just once</li>
    <li> So light, so easy to use. Good for Bon Bon hair do for dance practice or dance competition. Good customer service. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> great product and worth the wait. great value! Much larger than i expected..great for vintage hairstyles, bumper bangs, or faux bangs for curly heads...</li>
    <li> This shows two sizes. One big one small they give you two big so dont be fueled by the picture,  and way to big for your hair.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair and it just isn&#x27;t thick enough to hold these in my hair. I believe though if you have normal to thick hair they would work just fine.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use and bend/wrap pretty much any way you want them.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Only good for really long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too excited about it..but. they provide the purpose.I would say for kids ( cause they have more thin hair) works best...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold your hair in place when twisting it if you have layered hair. May work for all one length hair</li>
    <li> This is flimsy and wayyyy toooo small</li>
    <li> My hair is really thin and they didn&#x27;t hold well. I gave them to my mom. Her hair is thick and curly. She liked them.</li>
    <li> Fast ship. As described.</li>
    <li> I wish they had a larger size for long hair. these work great but are a bit hard to remove because of the material they are made of.</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking that they might not hold my oldest daughters hair but maybe my youngest.  She has thin hair and it is about 12-13 inches long and it doesn&#x27;t even stay in her hair.  Terrible product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on and I&#x27;m not planning to because it just smells awful! And feels so stiff. I can almost smell the cheap material this is made of and there&#x27;s no way I would put that thing on my hair!</li>
    <li> works well for all types of hair. wish it would stick better when closing before rolling it up into the bun</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in my hair (it would just fall right out), but the company was amazing to work with and promptly gave me a refund.</li>
    <li> May have to order more, after my mom saw them and I showed her how to make buns and French rolls in her hair.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time.. a great time saver for doing your hair!  Works exactly as described.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I bought these hair twists for my dance recital because I needed a perfect bun. My teacher recommended something like this to me, so I purchased them and got them a few weeks later (shipment from China obviously took a while.) The concept is good, because it is much easier and sturdier than a sock bun, but I don&#x27;t know how to secure it once I twist it into a bun, without an excessive amount of bobby pins that just end up showing through my hair. The actual bun twister shows through sometimes as well, but that is probably my fault since I am blonde and I bought black. The bottom line is if you have an idea about how to secure it more easily and buy one to match your hair color, this would be great!</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets of these. I had intended to use them to set my hair. I had used similar products before for this purpose and they worked great. These were shipped directly from China and took too long to arrive. Half of them had an embossed line in the middle, but they weren&#x27;t actually cut through completely at all. The foam is the cheapest material possible. the wires inside are not very flexible and impossible to straighten back out completely once used. If you intend to use them to make hair buns; forget it. They are not substantial enough to work for that purpose at all. In the couple of times I&#x27;ve used them, the foam is already falling apart. Even at $1.18 per set, they were a total waste of money. You&#x27;d be better off trying to use your dollar bill to make your bun or curl set - It would hold up better!</li>
    <li> This awesome clips allow you to wear the cutest bun updos hairstyles in just a few minutes. Very practical and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It did not hold my hair up, I do have long smoth hair so this do slid out of my hair easier than others. I could not figure out how to twist a braid.</li>
    <li> I use these to curl my hair without heat, and it depends on how you wrap your hair on them the type of your/wave you get. So awesome to get 3 different results depending on you you use them :)</li>
    <li> Only received one out of the set of 2. There was no package included simply the holder. It is so flimsy it will not hold my thin hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly hair and these work great for a nice quick bun. Would recommend, this is my second purchase.</li>
    <li> I do not use these a whole lot but they work pretty well I recommend having wet hair when using them and putting hair up into a pony tail and then put a hair tie near the ends of you hair as well.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when it came to buying this product after reading reviews, but I am so happy I did! I always wanted a full round looking bun and now I am able to achieve it! With this tool it is so easy to make a bun even with my thick layered hair. It took me like two tries to get used to it, but now it is very simple and fast! Also the shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I have medium length, fine textured hair,  and these are too small to wrap my hair around. More specifically they are too short.</li>
    <li> No good for think hair!</li>
    <li> Product was advertised as a quantity of 2 but I only received 1.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Very cheap foam. Is not worth it even a 1 penny. Looks awful and smells bad. It does not work with along and thick hair.</li>
    <li> IT is just what I wanted and works well. I would buy again. worth the money. works very nicely.thanks, looks great</li>
    <li> works well for women&#x27;s with thin hair  , comes in two size small and big!i use it almost everyday:) would order more</li>
    <li> It doesnt work that well. Its hard to keep it in place. Especially if you have long and thick hair.</li>
    <li> This does not come with instructions, but once you get the hang of it, it does do a ballerina bun nicely.  You have to tie your hair into a pony tail, pull hair through the sponge clip hole, close shut, pull down to the end of your pony tail and curl.  My advice is to start the curl facing up and curl towards the top of your head so that way, when you fold the edges of the sponge clip in, the edges are facing down and you can let gravity help covering it with your hair.  You then push your hair around those exposed edges and if you want, you can add a few bobby pins if you feel like it doesn&#x27;t cover it all the way.  Another tip for a more &amp;#34;tight fit&amp;#34;, after rolling your hair, I folded one side of the sponge clip and slid my hair over that part and then folding the other side of the sponge clip and pushing the hair over on that side, though it would look more like a spiral pattern than just a round bun.  I do have to say that after wearing it all day and taking it off in the evening - got a bonus &amp;#34;hair style&amp;#34; of curly/wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Good product, it makes putting my long hair up in a bun much easier. But I think there&#x27;s probably some better bun making products out there.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair that is very layered, so trying to do a sock bun was an absolute nightmare to try to keep all the layers up. Using this tool takes me 30 seconds to make a perfect bun. It is strong enough to keep my hair up and I rarely even use bobby pins with it. I can see how it would not work if you had really thick and long hair, but if you&#x27;re not in that category then this is the tool to use! Shipping did take a little longer then usual because it came from Hong Kong.</li>
    <li> Works great doesn&#x27;t lose its shape. Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions but I just googled it.  Very flexible and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> This was a hot mess! I bought them for members of a gymnastics team to use during competition. The foam is cheap and tears when you try to bend the razor sharp metal that it covers. DO NOT BUY THIS! You think papercuts are bad...this is worse.</li>
    <li> it was mailed to my mothers place and it has not made it to my hands to give it a proper review. when i get it i will rewrite a review</li>
    <li> This purchase went okay. The shipping was excellent and the product arrived timely and without any damage. They are exactly as described and to be honest weren&#x27;t as easy as we expected and how they were described. We are using them as part of a cheering uniform where you have to have perfect bun and these just do not cut it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to work it.  Passing on to someone else to try.</li>
    <li> Doesnt come with instructions</li>
    <li> I could never get this thing to work properly in my hair! It would also get stuck in my hair after a failed attempt and end up yanking out hair. Not fun!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t bend well . It makes my bun stay in a line . It looks better using a sock.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for this! I accidentally order a single one from another vendor. I left feedback on the one i didn&#x27;t  get yet!! It was suppose to be on this one..Sorry!! . But love it  and great price also. would recommend this!!!!!</li>
    <li> They are soft for your hair but I liked the ones with a click to hold it closed all day</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know why so many negative reviews, but I just got mine today and used it for the first time and it works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to. It was inexpensive and creates an bun with no fuss. If it breaks after a few wears, I won&#x27;t really feel cheated since the price tag would indicate that these are disposable...LOL. It also shipped much quicker than expected - it took about 3 weeks to get to me as opposed to the 6-8 weeks that was indicated.</li>
    <li> They seem pretty cheap and not sure how long they will hold up. They do not come with any sort of instructions, so I&#x27;ll have to find some sort of instructional video to figure out how to use them.</li>
    <li> Head is comfortable without pins or clips of any sort.  Also stays in place very well and is very lightweight.  Would definitely recommend to anyone with medium length or longer hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Totally doesn&#x27;t work. I was expecting something better but you get what you paid for. So ..</li>
    <li> This can work, but you must be creative and use lots of bobby pins. The instructions didn&#x27;t work for me. I don&#x27;t slide my hair through the hole; instead I wrap my hair around it after I put it in a pony tail. If you bought it and hate it, I recommend you try again.</li>
    <li> Do not hold hair well. Hard to use</li>
    <li> awful product.  it just doesn&#x27;t work well for what it says it does.</li>
    <li> This product does not work well with long and thick hair. The foam is too floppy and doesn&#x27;t create shapes that hold up well. Might work well with short, straight, and thin hair, though I can&#x27;t say for sure. I&#x27;ve had a much easier time with hard straight edge hairigamis such as the ones below (despite complaints about them having rough edges and cheap fabric). They manage to tame my wild mane of hair into a perfect bun that can last all day at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Leopard-Pattern-Styling-Hairagami-European/dp/B00JBC84G0/&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Hairagami-The-Original-Hair-Updo-Styling/dp/B003XZWEE4/</li>
    <li> Hard for me to use it. I have stick straight hair and it doesn&#x27;t stay put that much when i try to use this.</li>
    <li> It was too hard to use and very complicated. It couldn&#x27;t hold up my medium sized hair and it wasn&#x27;t even worth the dollar.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was so cheap, quality was terrible, but most importantly did not hold my hair AT ALL.  In the trash.</li>
    <li> I thought there were going to be pretty good to use in my hair overnight because they wouldn&#x27;t be uncomfortable like rollers. But I had to play around with them for awhile before I got a good wave in my long fragile hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t look as good as the ole&#x27; &#x27;hair donut&#x27; does. You can feel the wire, they&#x27;re just v cheap throwaway type things.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Of the vintage Hairdini, the Sarah Potempa Wrap-Up and these - they are my 3rd choice.  I really found the wire inside to be to flimsy to really give structure to the bun and so after wrapping my hair up a lot of pins were needed.  W/ the vintage Hairdini (which unfortunatly now seems to be unavailable and my blasted dog got hold of my last one and chewed it to oblivion) one/maybe two pins were needed and still somewhat optional.  The WrapUp was a little better but not 6x-the-price better IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair that comes to a couple of inches above my bra strap w long layers.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the black fabric showing through.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for this product, but it&#x27;s just okay. The main drawback is that the wire that bends the form is too short. There is a lot of foam on both ends which makes it difficult to spread your hair around to cover it. That said, it does the job. I&#x27;ve been using the product for several months now, and it has held up well. I just wish it was more like the Hairdini I used to have in the early 90&#x27;s-- it was longer and had a more flexible wire inside. Note: It did take quite awhile for the product to arrive, but the shipping cost was very reasonable given the distance it had to travel. If you don&#x27;t want to wait, I have seen similar products (plus a blonde version) at a popular discount superstore for about the same price.</li>
    <li> As soon as I wrapped my daughter&#x27;s hair around it the converted foam broke!</li>
    <li> I do not like this products. They pulled my hair off easily. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> I loved this! Made it super easy to make a bun, and it is very simple! The only thing I did differently was use a bobby pin to pin down some of my ends that escaped from the bun holder. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to make the perfect &amp;#34;sock bun&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These make doing a &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; bun so easy.  Love them!</li>
    <li> I use this product when I want to create some natural looking waves in my hair. I know that it is not the intended use for it, but it is what I wanted them for. It is comfortable and does not press too much but stays put</li>
    <li> Just okay, I wish it clipped at the end.</li>
    <li> ends won&#x27;t stay tight, won&#x27;t stay tight against your head. a couple of bounces and your bun is falling. Tried the different sizes on myself and my 7 year old daughter we both ended up with a dangling  hair bun. yes we used hair ties.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used these yet so will see...... the directions are NOT in English so it&#x27;ll be trail and error for me.</li>
    <li> They are just great.  Easy to use and if they break, it doesn&#x27;t matter....they didn&#x27;t cost that much!!!</li>
    <li> It works great the first time but after that it&#x27;s not as effective. The seller was great and easy to purchase from.</li>
    <li> easy to use, love trying new ways to wear my hair now</li>
    <li> No instructions included on how to use!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, but my hair is too thin so I don&#x27;t have enough hair to cover the clip.</li>
    <li> Strange .. Difficult to use</li>
    <li> My daughter and my self love these.  Makes the perfect bun on top of our head.  Super easy to use.</li>
    <li> did not hold a bun waste of money</li>
    <li> Bought 4 of these for a cheap price which is great! Just received it today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item arrived a week earlier than estimated dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first when I tried to make a bun, it didn&#x27;t work.It looked all messy. I felt that my hair was too long and I felt that since the tip of my hair was straight and when I tie it up, the ends of my pony tail doesn&#x27;t meet.  Basically I&#x27;m saying that it makes my hair hard to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then after 3 more tries, I finally achieved the bun.</li>
    <li> These really are easy to use. I have very long hair and it works perfectly and easily! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I could never figure out how to get the perfect, full bun without getting frustated and ripping it down. This product is so simple and takes not even 5 minutes to complete. There are 4 pieces total, 2 for small buns and 2 for bigger buns. Shipping was a little slow, but it was definitely worth the wait. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> The first time I saw the Magic Foam Sponge Clip was on tv. I bought it the same day I saw it on tv. I love it. So easy to use and the bun comes out perfect every time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a clip I used in the 80&#x27;s.  The clip from the 80&#x27;s had two pieces that fit together and then snapped into a circle.  This is not it.  :(</li>
    <li> Different way of making a perfect bun. I haven&#x27;t  received any complaints about this product yet so it doing its job!</li>
    <li> I have really long hair- like really really long. And it is almost impossible for me to get all of my hair around this thing. I also thought that they might click into the bun shape- but it&#x27;s just wire and doesn&#x27;t give a very crisp bun. Crispy buns. Burgers.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery. Love them. They work really , I have really thin  and it tightens really good.</li>
    <li> Bought these as agift for my mother n law she loves the they dont do so well in thick hair or maybe I just didnt use them right they didnt come with instructions I dont really know but she like them thats what matters</li>
    <li> These are so terrible. I am a server at a high end restaurant and was looking for an easy but elegant way to put my hair up for work. You are so much better off using a &amp;#34;bun perfect&amp;#34; or even a sock bun. These hair tools suck.</li>
    <li> easy to use and looks amazing, I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
    <li> Good quality item, shipped quickly. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Really did not work on my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Waited a long tim eto get something that does not work very well. I guess its made for people with very thin hair I have thick hair and alo at that can not get all my hair together in this.</li>
    <li> I just received my item a few days ago (shipping took no less than 1 month), but am decently happy with the performance. Unfortunately, when I received it, I had to cut the slits in the middle of the two larger sponges (it didn&#x27;t punch through), but after that it seemed to work out fine. The bigger size made my bun look huge, but the smaller one looks great. Bobby pins and an extra ponytail holder help hold it in for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw a Youtube guru did a tutorial on it and it looked so easy and nice! Used it today and got so much compliments on my bun (:</li>
    <li> I love that it puts a great soft wave in my hair with no  sleeping on curlers or using hot iron tools</li>
    <li> Because it  work great&lt;br /&gt;If it work I will like it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends and my family</li>
    <li> These were a little over a dollar (including shipping) for four-  two small and two large.  Yes, it takes several weeks to arrive and yes, the foam and wires are crappy and will probably break or wear out after a few uses.  At ~25 cents a piece, I think it is a pretty good deal for a disposable hair tool that works well for even several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need directions, you can find thousands of tutorials on youtube, just type in \\&quot;bun maker tutorial\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pit-length hair that is mostly one length and of average thickness, maybe a bit on the fine side. It takes seconds to creates a nice-looking bun.  If you have a lot of layers, especially short ones, this is probably not for you.  I like the additional volume this gives my bun, but I can see how it would not work well for very thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that I would prefer to have the choice of all one size- I don&#x27;t have any use for the 2 smaller ones.  I will probably order a few more sets to have around when these inevitably wear out.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair that is 2 feet long roughly. The large size won&#x27;t wrap around my pony tail in a way that would make a bun without my hair on it. With my hair wrapped on it, it makes a u shape for a couple seconds then a tangled mess when it falls out because the wire isn&#x27;t strong enough. If you have very thin, maybe shoulder length hair then it might work.</li>
    <li> I reported that this product it hold my hair very well.Product works great!</li>
    <li> I cant figure out how to hide the ends and wont wear it with the ends showing.  Not thrilled with this product.  Came with NO instructions, just the two bun makers in an envelope.</li>
    <li> These are very quick and easy to use.  I have long and very fine hair, and most hair tools just don&#x27;t work for me.  These, however, work great!  I can put my hair in a bun in under a minute and be ready to go.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these.  I use them to curl my straight hair without heat. With my hair still wet I roll my hair up toward my roots and voila!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well for long, thick hair. The material is not great, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I feel it needed to be a little more flexable than it was. I have very fine hair, when I tried to make a bun at the end it was very hard to get it to conform. It also too forever to get here</li>
    <li> Products were okay received two big and two small, usually stuck with the small since i have short shoulder length hair. Well product does the trick, simple to use no directions were needed, makes a neat hair bun.</li>
    <li> First off I would like to note that it took 18 days to get my order, which isn&#x27;t bad and way before the expected delivery date (it had to ship from China, after all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the item is on par with similar products that cost a lot more (I paid just barely over one dollar with shipping) I bought a plastic hair bun tool that didn&#x27;t really work out for me so I decided to give the foam ones a chance.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with the results, I achieved a neat bun which isn&#x27;t easy to do with my hair thickness, length and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the item is made from strong wire I was able to bend it into place and it&#x27;s actually holding nicely without any bobby pins, I would definitely buy this item again once I wear this set out, great bargain and it worked for me.</li>
    <li> my hair type:&lt;br /&gt;dark brown, thick, unprocessed (natural), wavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;likes:&lt;br /&gt;takes 2 minutes to create a neat looking bun with the least amount of effort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;i took one star off because the inside wire is not thick/heavyweight enough to REALLY secure my very full head of hair on its own&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tips/comments:&lt;br /&gt;-practice makes perfect, give it a week&lt;br /&gt;-if you have little to no layers you will LOVE this. if you have many layers (i do) i find that i have to start winding the product at about halfway through the length of my hair, otherwise it starts to fall out way too much&lt;br /&gt;-secure with a few pins if your hair is on the heavier side and/or heavily layered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this works great for the price especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tie my hair in a pony and then put the hair through the center of the bun maker. then i close the opening and run it forward (in front of my face, not back towards my butt, lol) to the tips of my hair (actually,only to where my layers begin because if i put it through to the ends my layers begin to fall out). once i&#x27;ve rolled it as tightly or loosely as i want (different effect with each) and have reached my pony i spread out the hair a bit to cover the rest of the foam and then bend the foam wire around my pony. then i just play with the positioning making sure to cover the foam. voila! neat and tidy in a matter of minutes-no joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip: like i said my hair is pretty heavy so i sometimes use a second hair tie around the bun after it&#x27;s been made, just to secure it in place. i&#x27;ve noticed if i don&#x27;t use the second tie it can get loose and undone hours later.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite beauty finds of 2012- I love the way this makes my hair look, and how easy it is to get that perfect bun. the first few times are kind of confusing, and I certainly thought it was a piece of junk, but once I got the hang out it, now it&#x27;s easy, quick and adorable! highly recommend....</li>
    <li> This product does not work. The bun does not stay and it loosens. I don&#x27;t like it and definitely don&#x27;t recommend it! I&#x27;d like to have my money back.</li>
    <li> They are terrible they dont hold your hair up its not like they describe do not buy this product trust me</li>
    <li> These are OK to use to put your hair up for everyday but I would not use for a nice hair do.  They took a long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> There are absolutely NO instructions for use!  For someone, like myself, who has never seen this product before, let alone used it, thats a BIG problem.  Had to go online to look for instructions.  otherwise the product was exactly what they promised.  For the price not a bad deal, but simple instructions or even a website for the instructions would have been good.  It would have taken this product from 4 stars to 5.</li>
    <li> My hair is too thin to use a sock, but this thing works for me. I can finally have a &#x27;sock&#x27; bun. It&#x27;s easy to use too so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> I find these to be useless. I am good at doing my own hair and thought theses would replace using a hair donut. Not at all! The wire in the foam doesn&#x27;t stay bent so it won&#x27;t hold a bun.</li>
    <li> I love this product... I had to look through youtube for videos on how to use this, but overall it really held my hair in place during the day... it made my bun look sleek and simply done... as if it were done at a salon... great product!</li>
    <li> They are too flimsy and a waste of money. You are better off purchasing a round hair donut for buns.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the clips as much as I expected! The inner part of the clips in made of metal and is very hard that makes it very hard to bend it down the hair ( I tried to use the clips on my hair based on the you tube video that I watched)! In general, I do not recommend it!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, beautiful hair she has to wear in a bun for ballet class. There is definitely NOT enough stability to hold her hair up sitting still, there is no way it would hold it in a bun if she tried to move. It just falls right down and there isn&#x27;t anyway to put pins in it to hold it. I watched several youtube videos to ensure I was using it correctly. NO MATTER WHAT it would NOT hold her hair. I wish I had NOT wasted my money on this flimsy , unusable product.</li>
    <li> Really good product I didn&#x27;t have any problems it took a bit long to receive package but other than that I love these bun makers. They make the perfect bun every time perfect for lazy days when you have no clue what to do with your hair or when you want to go with an easy, classy, sophisticated, clean look. Two thumbs up! I got exactly what I wanted very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> CHEAP &amp; ITS WORKS, received 2 small &amp; 2 large. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to make the perfect bun.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get these to work without looking ridiculous....maybe if you have very, very long hair.</li>
    <li> A little small for my hair.</li>
    <li> works great fast and efficient, saves time in the morning, hair looks well put together, get many compliments on my bun</li>
    <li> Might not seem like much, foam and wire, but it does work! I use it for work (nurse), and it&#x27;s so quick! For 96 cents plus free shipping and 4 pieces!! You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t break your hair.  Stays in place. They seem at first that they may be to big. But they are the perfect size for my hair. Great for  children&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> I have fine shoulder length hair.. It works great for a top bun.. I bought them mostly for my daughter, her hair is longer and she&#x27;s always pulling it up..</li>
    <li> The product looks pretty it even makes perfect buns but it only works on thin and medium length. The buns look gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has fine hair.  There is so much of the bun maker to cover with hair, so it may work on thicker hair.  I have since bought her Hot Buns and she has had no problems with that product.  Also doesn&#x27;t work well on layered hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.. doesn&#x27;t come with instructions (pretty self explanitory but still), doesn&#x27;t have a way the \\&quot;bun wrap\\&quot; sticks together. Its like a bread tie with foam around it... Should spent more money and got the one off tv....</li>
    <li> my daughter likes to fix her hair, she makes these buns in he hair, but without an item like this, i believe she uses socks?, but she said these are really great they work really well and come in all sizes, they are worth the money.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this and all I had to do is to order it.....she keeps using it so I presume it works well for her!</li>
    <li> Took forever to arrive. Not even foam, like paper. Not for long hair. Looses it shape.&lt;br /&gt;Please be a better consumer, read the reviews and pass on this one. NOT WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> it is easy to use.. good price my hair looks more prettier then just tie up.. i like it a lot</li>
    <li> bought these for my daughter but i liked how they work so i use them also, fast shipping too! will continue to use while they last</li>
    <li> This product did not perform as promised. It didnt hold my hair in place and pretty much fell apart after trying to get it to work.</li>
    <li> I have thinner, blonde hair, and these were not the ones for me.  Should work much better on thicker, darker hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, and cannot get these to work to save my life. Rather difficult to get to stay, and very thin and flimsy.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and it ties your hair together neatly. Really love the design of the product. Just follow the instructions on the selling page.</li>
    <li> if you have very little hair works well maybe, not if you have a full head of hair or heavy hair</li>
    <li> its a great product to use if you have trouble making a bun in your hair. and its very cheap</li>
    <li> I love these! Pretty easy to use &amp; look real good!</li>
    <li> Does not hold the hair up.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and long so these wear great.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work too well or hold your bun. There always seems to be a part in the bun and it just doesn&#x27;t hold it tight</li>
    <li> i was not satisfied with this product by any means. it did not separate as shown in the picture and it didnt keep my hair up at all. thank goodness it was only a dollar and change, but still. very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Product works well once I figured out how to use it.  An improvement would be if there were detailed instructions included.</li>
    <li> It holds my hair real well but the only problem i faced was that i am unable to make a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; bun. I guess its mainly form the fact it did not come with any instruction booklet and hence i might be doing it all wrong. But that can be easily remedied by watching a demo video on youtube. I am having fun experimenting with it.</li>
    <li> After trying ConAir Bun maker (and find it too big for my 9 year old girl), this one is far better, simple to use and quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;I am a dad who has a lot of trouble making a bun for my 9 year old ballerina, so I was desperetly looking for a simple way to do it.&lt;br /&gt;I finally found it with this.  The sponge on the clip, avoids the hair to slip and the process of making the bun is so simple. (and unexpensive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY recommended</li>
    <li> If your hair is long enough, this makes for an easy bun. The only thing is you definitely need bobby pins to bridge the gap that happens. My daughter went to a birthday party and looked super cute.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried homemade sock buns, the mesh donuts, spin pins, etc. but nothing has compared to the ease and finished product of this foam bun former. I have incredibly fine, baby hair and the small bun maker works perfectly for creating a professional work-appropriate bun hair style.  For more of a weekend, fun, messy hair-do, I tease my hair first and use the larger bun maker.  Very versatile and super easy to put in and take out. Even with my blonde hair, I have had no issues covering up the black colored foam. You just have to fan the hair out properly throughout the bun.</li>
    <li> it works really well, easy way to get perfect bun. I haven&#x27;t used the small clip but larger one is really good and long lasting.</li>
    <li> My daughter had it just for one hour in her hair and the metal string was out of the fabric!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know how to use them. I cannot fasten my hair. Anyway, it&#x27;s really cheap for four, maybe I should practise more</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re expecting the perfect ballet type bun, do not buy this. That&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting and the results were disappointing. This is basically a thin piece of wire wrapped in foam.  I have thin and light hair to begin with, so I thought it would work out. I wrapped my hair around the clip, as instructed, then proceeded to close the clip in a circle shape. It did close slightly, but not tight enough. It left my hair looking limp. I was not impressed with this at all. I think making a sock bun would work a lot better than this. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Well, the old saying, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;, couldn&#x27;t be more accurate for this THING! First off, I&#x27;m a guy with very long/thick hair. I play drums in a rock band, and my hair tends to get in the way at times. So, I wanted to try something a bit different, to secure my hair during practice. After a MONTH, the darn thing finally showed up. It&#x27;s a cheap piece of foam, wrapped around some type of wire, kinda feels like a wire coat hanger. Anyway, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try the thing out, once I took it out of the package. I tried the bigger version, ain&#x27;t no way all this hair&#x27;s gonna fit through the small one. I pulled all my hair through, twisted it up tight, connected the two sides together...OOPS, no type of clip to secure the two sides! Immediately, the thing popped back open, and away went the bun. As another reviewer mentioned, this thing snags your hair pretty good, and even got stuck in my hair. I almost couldn&#x27;t get it back out. I thought I was gonna have to cut it out of my hair. I mean, without some sort of clip to secure the two sides, this thing is USELESS! It would be like a ponytail holder that ripped in half, USELESS! So, congrats to the people who&#x27;ve had some type of success with this thingy. But, if your hair is long and thick, at least to the mid section of your back, FORGET IT!</li>
    <li> These are better than the &amp;#34;hotbuns&amp;#34; for making curls. They are a little difficult for making a bun but they still get the job done.</li>
    <li> I have already writtten one review, so I will leave it at that. Any purchases over seas are slow so expect it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and creates a great look. This is an amazing price and I couldn&#x27;t find anything of this value or quality anywhere else.</li>
    <li> i really really love this its good with all types of hair, i have very long and thick hair and it works wounders it is also great with my nieces hair and she has very cearly and short love it, i will defently re purches this</li>
    <li> Impossible to use on long hair!</li>
    <li> This came really quick, and they were packed very well. Also the price is really cheap, stuff is really good. i just love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these! I can&#x27;t really get my hair to cover it all the way on myself, but they look great in my 7 year old&#x27;s hair. She has a bun obsession, so this worked out nicely.</li>
    <li> I like it! it makes my hair into a nice donut shape.&lt;br /&gt;its ok durable throughout the day, just not too active cause hairs will start to fall out and look out of place~&lt;br /&gt;but overall, its definitely perfect to use on a casual bun day :)</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and makes great looking buns. Works every single time unlike the &amp;#34;sock bun&amp;#34;....that method only cooperates when it feels like it</li>
    <li> These foam bun formers were a disappointment mostly because they did not come with any instructions on how to use them. Sadness</li>
    <li> my hair is too fine for this. and apparently i have shorter layers bc they seem to fall out of this bun befoore i can even secure it.</li>
    <li> No instructions. But I believe my hair is too short for this. I was able to get my hair up in it but there wasn&#x27;t enough hair to wrap around device. Didn&#x27;t look to good. Plus it did not stay in hair very lo g. Became loose after a short time.oh well it was inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Took me a few times to get used to using them. After that it was so easy and i love them. Does the job very well.</li>
    <li> Falls out and if blonde/looks and makes u worried.</li>
    <li> make my hair look great. easy to use. only problem i had was my hair didnt fit right but just play with it to your likings.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM IS GREAT AND VERY EASY TO USE AND ALL MY SISTER ARE ENJYOING THESE GREAT PRODUCT ON HAIR</li>
    <li> They work great but after a while the foam around the two ends will start to tear a bit exposing the metal frame.</li>
    <li> This gadget works so great and what a FANTASTIC deal was offered on this item. I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The seller was super fast on shipping this and I&#x27;m VERY pleased! My sincere thanks to everyone involved in making this available to us all! And I HIGHLY recommend both the item and this seller! Thanks all!</li>
    <li> This thing is not an easy thing to style your hair with. I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s my hair that&#x27;s the problem but I was not able to create a  bun with this product (I have medium fine shoulder length black hair in a layered haircut). The product just kept slipping off while I attempted to roll my hair around it. I&#x27;ve tried numerous times but no luck. I even used Youtube videos as guide but it was just NOT happening. In addition, this product just looks cheap and not sturdy at all. It&#x27;s pretty much just foam with a bendable material inside it. I knew that before I ordered it but when I actually received it, the really cheap look of the product still took me by surprise. Now, they are just sitting inside my drawer.</li>
    <li> I used it twice and after that I can&#x27;t anymore , I have long long long hair maybe that&#x27;s why brakes fast for me , even though I did it perfectly at the beginning.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and at first I didn&#x27;t think it would hold all my hair to make the bun. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to buy it at first but why not give it a try. When I got my bun maker it made the perfect donut bun like it said it would. My hair type is not thin or thick but in the middle and straight. I also tried it on the my friends hair which is long and thick and it worked perfectly. I would say if you are thinking of buying without any doubt you should. Its a great way to style your hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this thing. I thought it looked completely ridiculous but it arrived before the other style of bun-maker I ordered, so I tried it right away and I was so shocked at how easy it was (I am a complete novice) to use! Flip your head upside-down, stick your hair through the slot and arrange it so it&#x27;s pretty even across, and roll it in the direction of your forehead. Turn the ends down and tuck any loose ends with a bobby pin. I absolutely love this, I got 2 large bun makers and 2 small ones! I&#x27;m going to order another set. I think the only downside to this is that the cover is made of some kind of foam material and I am concerned that it might dry-rot later on, but for the price and results I think even if it lasts only 6 months, I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> came without the split in the middle so it was useless. too cheap to worry about sending it back and waiting</li>
    <li> dont work will , went in the garbage...junk!!!! i would not even give them away. so sorry i got this</li>
    <li> Received in timely order and is now one of the better items on the market for easy access to holding a bun for your hair.  Not as good as the original Hairdini, but nobody is making the original hairdini, including Hairdini.  This is a good substitute for it.</li>
    <li> Well I can’t say that I am a fan of this little thing. I had really hopes it would work for me, but unfortunately the first one I tried broke. Then the next one didn’t seem to work with my hair. I have longer hair so maybe that it is why it wasn’t working. I’m not really angry because for how cheap they are I guess I got what I paid for. I will try a different brand next time and maybe it won’t break on me and will actually be able to work with my hair. If you have shorter hair give it a try it might work, but for those of us with longer hair I would try a more expensive one to get better quality.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and this only worked if I divided my hair. It worked great in my 10 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use as goodie bag stuffers for my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s birthday party - perfect for short to long hair</li>
    <li> I love these. I have been using them to put my hair in a perfect bun for work for years now. Seriously, everyone thinks i have a sock-bun in my hair, but these are WAY BETTER!! Your hair stays secure and tight all day long even if you go to PT (work out), but best of all they are LIGHT. They do not weigh your head down. You can twist your hair up into a bun and the only weight is your own hair. The Big twist-holder is what i use , the small one is better for short hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a plain, clear bag.  Would be nice if came with some kind of instruction or guidance.</li>
    <li> Cheap and useless. Was not impressed with this product at all! Concept sounded nice but in practice it doesn&#x27;t work. Plus it ships directly from china. I won&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This works alot better than the thin plastic kind, but it is still tricky to get your hair to stay in it and roll to make a perfect bun as the photo shows.</li>
    <li> we  were  very excited to get this product  but it broke the first time we used it.  the clip/ button  feel off.  terrible product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair styler! &lt;3 It&#x27;s very useful and it&#x27;s easy to apply. It&#x27;s also foamy around so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair and it makes a nice look for at home too. It gives your hair a cute and simple style.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and wearing a bun is always a pain for me. This is so easy to use and makes my hair look like there&#x27;s more there!</li>
    <li> I opened this cheaply made item and just don&#x27;t understand how to use it effectively. My mistake. It was only two bucks. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> You cant get anything made cheaper than this was. Will not work well enough to even hold your hair. Not worth spending the money to send it back. In the trash it will go!</li>
    <li> The product itself is made from a flat metal wire type material encased in cheap foam which gives it a disposable feel. I think I might actually like the product if they had put a little thought into the types of materials they used.  It would probably work best on thinner finer hair, but I have very heavy thick hair and it kind of hurts for me to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;It would take me forever to get a perfect bun but using thins has made it so much easier. I have already recommended this product to many of my friends and family members.</li>
    <li> it is rather fragile and not as i was expecting , maybe i dont know how to use it, came with no instructions</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military and purchased this hoping that it would work for me. Didn&#x27;t work, the metal inside this bun thingy is crap. I didn&#x27;t expect it to have metal in it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and these work well for me.  I wish I could have found some light brown ones--it would look better--but all in all they do what they say they will do and are cheap.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them. Thank you</li>
    <li> This are handy, simple bun helpers. My hair is long and thick so they don&#x27;t stay in as well as I&#x27;d like but they&#x27;re great for my daughter.</li>
    <li> was to small for thick hair</li>
    <li> There are many other items that provide a more consistent bun look. Plus I found that with my fine hair it was hard to cover-up the ends of this product. By the end of the night it was showing!! Not a cute look at all. It probably works fine with thick hair though.</li>
    <li> Its awesome! GEt it! GOod deal on price. Does what it says. So simple and convenient. Totally recommend it to anyone. Don&#x27;t put a sock in your hair when you can use this coool tool!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to put my hair into buns and its been difficult considering my many layers. But now I&#x27;ve found one that works! Easy to use. Just use with 2 safety pins. Inexpensive AND you get 4 pieces! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Need AT LEAST med-long hair to use these. Also, if you have layers in your hair it doesn&#x27;t work well! Overall, a good product.</li>
    <li> Love that there were a couple in this pack, I always seem to temporarily lose these so back up are great. Can&#x27;t beat the price. These work better for me than donuts and they stay in my hair all day, though I do have a hard time getting the hair to cover the back all day sometimes, but I have dark hair so it never stands out.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of it they work great!</li>
    <li> It was way too hard for my long hair to accept that thing. It doesnt work if your hair is heavy or long,</li>
    <li> Works great shipping was faster then expected I got 4 bun makers 2 different sizes works well with long hair u have to uses bobby pins to hold some loose ends highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I have very, very thin, fine hair and the small sized bun maker works perfect and doesn&#x27;t show at all through my hair. It also stays in place pretty well without even using any bobby pins, but I still like to use one or two to be sure nothing moves. I have also tried the &#x27;sock bun&#x27; style bun makers and I like this one much, much better.</li>
    <li> This is very cheaply made. There is no way to style my hair with this because of the sponge, it doesnt glide easily (or at all) with hair. You get what you pay for this.</li>
    <li> This product was cheap. There is no clip to keep the bun in place. It will not hold a bun in my hair or my daughters hair. It also took three weeks for me to recieve it. The only Pro was it was cheap. I only paid one dollar for it so it was worth the try. I wouldnt reccomend this product because there is no way to keep the bun in place.</li>
    <li> These work great! And were so inexpensive! My hair is long so i used the larger one I pulled my hair up with my hands like I was about to put it in a pony tail and just twisted the sponge around my pony tail and than twisted my hair around the sponge into a bun and put a pony tail holder around my bun. You couldnt see the sponge and it stayed all day. It worked better than I expected! And for the price why wouldn&#x27;t you take a chance and try them!!</li>
    <li> I like these for my kids. It comes in 2 sizes. Total of 4 ( w from each size&lt;br /&gt;Small one is for kids under 7&lt;br /&gt;The sponge that covers the metal torn after copple of use</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a quick easy way to put up your hair! Love this product it&#x27;s all I wanted and exactly as described. Just needed a how to guide. Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it. I try an d it didn&#x27;t do anythingwanT for me. My sock bun works better. The foam smells weird. And is. Not long enough to wrapped long hair.</li>
    <li> Horrible and easy to break</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me......maybe I wasn&#x27;t doing it right.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try again...</li>
    <li> I use mine often. Makes a perfect bun:)</li>
    <li> I use these all the time. I have straight hair almost to my waist and it&#x27;s a quick easy way to make a cute bun. The only issues are they don&#x27;t last long. They get bent up and torn but considering the price it&#x27;s not much of an issue. I just order several at once and switch to a new one every month or 2. I also wish there was a way to clip the ends together without using a seperate hair clip. But that&#x27;s not a big problem either. Overall these are great!</li>
    <li> I liked them much better without the slit in the middle. Wish I could find them now one solid piece.</li>
    <li> My sister and I have two different types of hair and this worked great for the both of us.wish it shipped faster though!!</li>
    <li> Totally affordable and it works! Very good deal for the money. Makes a much neater bun than any of the more expensive ones in stores as well as home-made versions.  This was a good buy!</li>
    <li> These bun makers are so cheap on amazon!  If you know how to use them right, they are quick for on the go and make perfect buns.  You just need to practice.  They are definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very happy this item did not take the longest projected delivery date but more like five days after first date given. Really great for medium fine hair. Holds way better than I thought, I was working out and forgot a ponytail and just this alone held my hair up for the entire hr and a half I worked out. Also great for work so easy to use.</li>
    <li> It took forever to recieve then when I tried putting it on it didn&#x27;t work, didn&#x27;t even hold my hair up and was very flimsy. I would not recommend buying this product I was very,very disappointed.</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk. It took forever to be shipped because it was coming from hong kong.  When they arrived they smelled bad, and were wrapped in plastic.  I tried the large one for my hair and it ripped it out.  I ended up throwing all four of them out.  They are a piece of junk and you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it really works as well as the commercials make it look. Mostly because I have really long and really thick hair. But I&#x27;m working with it.</li>
    <li> Great item for the price!  Not only does this clip make a perfect bun, it curls hair as well.  I just roll my hair with one of the large clips at bedtime.  By morning, I have a curly style.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Works great on both my girls hair! They love that they make the perfect bun on their own</li>
    <li> defiantly comes in handy when you are having a bad hair day. They could be a bit stronger, I have problems with it holing my hair in place due to it being so thick. After I apply a few bobbin pins it seems to be perfect.</li>
    <li> not what i was expecting at all very cheap quality very bad deal they are so hard to get in and twist and if u have strong hair just forget about it</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with the Twist Holder Clip Bun Hair Twist Braid Tool. Is made of cheap material. Doesn&#x27;t work well on long hair.</li>
    <li> My mother and nice love this.  How could i not buy it.  I recommend this for others.</li>
    <li> Not very good for thick hair</li>
    <li> Bought 3 sets.... my hair is too thick...won&#x27;t work...my daughters iz too thin...won&#x27;t work...granddaughters too fine....won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Product is same in picture but the instructions are not in English and I couldn&#x27;t follow along. Before buying this product, I would suggest using YouTube or pintrest to learn how to use it.</li>
    <li> Just couldn&#x27;t hold my hair up. It would unroll immediately.</li>
    <li> Not much to them, I guess you get what you pay for. I have four girls and all of them have issues. Maybe time will tell.</li>
    <li> There were no instructions in the package. It took me a while to realize what it was when it first came in the mail. I thought it was something my husband ordered. My daughter,  a teen, had no problem getting it to work and she has blonde hair. It looked crappy in my haor and I have long black hair because I didnt know what I was doing. I had to ask my daughter for help.</li>
    <li> Total pieces of junk. No instructions one ripped in half the first time I tried using it, leaving the wire handing out. What a total waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> Got these for my great neice, and she loved them. Went around her party guests, showing everyone, how they work..</li>
    <li> Though this is a cheap item I was expecting to receive a hair product not a phone cover that does not go with any phone I have???</li>
    <li> This item does not hold your hair well at all. It&#x27;s not strong enough and keeps slipping off. In addition, one of the items came without being wrapped In a package. I felt like it had been used.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple &#x27;bun assistants&#x27; in the past and none have worked well with my thin shoulder length hair - this was a breeze and makes a nice neat, clean bun.</li>
    <li> I used this item to try and make a bun but it has failed to work it rolls up in a lump and is not reliable</li>
    <li> Product came 2 days before the expected delivery date. Which was great! It is a good product. Definitely speeds up doing a bun on your hair. I find that it works best with thin hair and medium sized length hair. If you have long hair that has some body to it this might not be the best product for you. After a long day when you take it off it leaves nice waves. Definitely do recommend.</li>
    <li> its as same as picture, good qaulity, the color its beautiful, it perfect, i love it, its that i expected</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted! Its perfect for long hair, do it your self up do&#x27;s. And more! Its a better version of the old Hair dini from the early 90s.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the Bun Hair Former Donut, aside from having to use bobby pins to hold them together. Fun to use and work with on a lazy hair day. A+! :)</li>
    <li> These are great, and I love the different sizes. If you have thick hair I don&#x27;t think they will hold up. Other than that, good product if you have the right type of hair.</li>
    <li> It was never purchased with the intention of making a bun. (For that, doughnut ring thingies are obviously better.) This was for an old style roll updo. For that, it will work. The foam does not seem very durable, but the wire inside is sturdy. But you get 4 for such a good price that it is stupid to complain. Overall, I am happy. Cool bargain.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t think this would be strong enough for my hair, since my hair is really thick, but i gave it a shot. it turned out to be perfect!</li>
    <li> The quality is not good, it is not worth its price. I hope I bought it from other store instead of here.</li>
    <li> I HAVE VERY THIN HAIR, WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE I GOT THE HANG OF IT.  MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT I HAVE RED HAIR AND THE CLIP IS BLACK SO IF MY BUN IS NOT PERFECT YOU CAN SEE THE CLIP</li>
    <li> Very hard to use on hair I don&#x27;t recommend the waste of money for me sorry I hope this is helpful</li>
    <li> The wiring is too stiff and does not work at all. I&#x27;ve shoulder length hair and initially thought I have to try the bigger pcs but no luck. Good thing it was really cheap....guess it&#x27;s true....nothing cheap is good.</li>
    <li> Mine only came with one of the big ones. By the time I got it in the mail, I honestly wasn&#x27;t even sure what it was! Maybe with practice this will be useful?</li>
    <li> it works very well. I like it very much. Although I cut my hair this year, it is still worth recommending to my friends.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. You can easily find better - but I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for 95 cents!</li>
    <li> The product looks exactly like the picture. I have long thin hair &amp; it holds up pretty good. Its really cute! I love how perfect the buns come out too! If you&#x27;re looking for hair accessories, I recommend this one! It&#x27;s gives you a full cute bun &amp; it&#x27;s cheap! Who doesn&#x27;t like cheap pricing? Thinking of ordering some more &amp; giving them away to some friends. :)</li>
    <li> these do not hold thick hair and are cheaply made.</li>
    <li> These tools really work. I use larger one for fine waist long hair, and it does make a nice bun. Much better than hot bun tool, less damaging to hair, not as tight and looks just as good.</li>
    <li> The lower rating only because I am not sure how well the foam will hold up to the many usages I will give it.  I have used a plastic similar in past and was totally satisfied with results.  So, excited to give these a try.</li>
    <li> I have long, layered, medium thick hair down to the middle of my back.  The best way to deal with the layers so you don&#x27;t have any hair falling or sticking out is to only go down as far as your shortest layer an start wrapping up from there.  If you have short layers or lots of layers, this isn&#x27;t for you.  They stick in place very well without needing any other pins or clips but I do occasionally need to pin down my hair that escapes.  An awesome side effect is that these also put great curls in your hair and they are so much faster, easier and more comfortable to put in and leave in over night than the old fashioned sponge curlers.  These give you a cute hair style quickly and easily.  I am happy with my purchase and definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> even 1 dollar is too much for these useless things flimsy and will not stay together comes apart so my hair is in disarray</li>
    <li> These work as they are intended. I Youtubed tutorials before buying this but ran into a small problem. My hair is too think to let it close fully so I have to safety pin the foam part together. Other than that, works perfectly! Easy for a quick morning when running late and professional enough to wear to work. I&#x27;ve used the Chignon donut and had no success. This works well!</li>
    <li> I have really long hair so whenever I tried to keep my hair in a bun using these donute buns, it was difficult to put them together, however, this particular one works perfectly. My hair comes to my waist, and yet the large bun maker definitely holds my hair together and looks neat. Since I&#x27;m in the hospital most of my time, my hair needs to be kept off my face and neat and because I like my hair long, I figured keeping my hair in a bun is the best look. This bun maker never let me down! People also ask me how my hair is kept so neat and I always tell them about this bun maker. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a donut bun maker!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is way to think fot this to work. We love the concept and wished it would have worked for her air type.</li>
    <li> the product comes from hongkong, i believe. so it takes for a few weeks to get here. the hidden metal wire inside is use for snap your hair, wrap it, bend it, and move whatever you want to style your hair. i believe after i use it many times the wire will break apart. but the price less than $5, and you can get 4 of them, plus free shipping, for me is the good deal. thanks to the seller.</li>
    <li> These bun holders/makers work exactly as expected.  The quality isn&#x27;t bad for the price, although I don&#x27;t believe they are going to be a &amp;#34;forever and ever amen&amp;#34; type of product.  The foam feels like it will probably break apart with continued and repeated use, but I haven&#x27;t seen any of these that aren&#x27;t actually covered in durable fabric that I felt would hold up either......</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can do so much more with my hair. Best buy ever. I do not know how I managed without them.</li>
    <li> usable, would have liked to receive a bigger size.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and very small.</li>
    <li> Awful!! Don&#x27;t buy these!!  They didn&#x27;t stay in and looked terrible!  Use a donut instead! I&#x27;m bummed I wasted my money on this! :-P</li>
    <li> doesnt keep hair tight enough to put pins in and you DO need pins. also had to go to post office to get it since it is from china. something to do with  terrorism.</li>
    <li> These work great and cost about 1/100th what someone was charging at Pikes market in Seattle. Not great for thick hair though.</li>
    <li> Not suitable to those who have extremely long pocohontas hair... Aka me. It&#x27;s hard to make a full bun without the bun looking like it&#x27;s eaten like an opening.</li>
    <li> Use these all the time! Love them. Easy to use</li>
    <li> I received my single clip bun hair twist a few weeks after initially purchasing it. Not only was one of them missing, (there should have been two as per the merchandise description), but the piece is extremely flimsy and can&#x27;t hold a shape to save its life. I would certainly not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Four of them for such a low price. Two are small size and two are normal size.Very worth the money.</li>
    <li> It has a good grip in my thin hair and very easy to handle since you only haveto fold the ends of this bun maker.</li>
    <li> Pro: I have long hair but it&#x27;s extremely fine so it&#x27;s tough for me to find products that will work with my hair and actually hold it in place. Just used the smaller one yesterday, and even napped with it in, and it still seemed to hold up pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The four pieces came in a shipping envelope but were not in any kind of retail packaging, they were just loose, and there were absolutely no instructions in the box. I had to come back to Amazon to look at the diagram provided, but I was really hoping for some kind of documentation with other ideas on how to use these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product does ship from Hong Kong (I wish that would have been made clear)...I didn&#x27;t mind because I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry to receive them but it would have been nice to have the option to order elsewhere if I had needed it to come more quickly. That being said, considering how far the order had to travel, I received it very quickly.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out exactly how to use these..... so I gave them to my beautician!  The price was certainly right!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because it was so cheap I figured I had nothing to lose and no other method of sock buns worked for me. I found it&#x27;s best to put my hair in a ponytail before I use it because it keeps my hair together so I can focus on rolling it evenly. It is really easy but it takes some practice to get the hair to cover the ends. My first try with the hairtie I got it though :) Well worth the price and wait - thank you!</li>
    <li> Does not hold my thick hair very well but got for such a great price. I gave them to my niece who loves them.</li>
    <li> Does not hold hair like it should.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have enough hair to use these. My hair is fine.  These probably would work for a person who had really think hair.</li>
    <li> You got what you paid for. It&#x27;s useless and just trash.  Not as it describe and can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
    <li> I like them because they are easy to use and practical&lt;br /&gt;Very recomendable if you have to wake up early and have no time at all</li>
    <li> I never even got this product. Its a good thing I paid only $1 something for it. Good luck getting this product if you plan on buying it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on thick layered hair, or if you have wavy hair. I have both, which falls till around my shoulder blades, and when I try roll my hair with this, hair falls out from all ends like a fountain. Plus, the quality seems very low, hardly stays put once you have hooked the ends together. Would not recommend for anyone with hair like mine.</li>
    <li> These do the job. Not great quality but they worked enough to pin them in my daughters hair</li>
    <li> daughter&#x27;s hair has to be in a ballet bun every week for dance class. We go straight from school so not a lot of time to fussing with hair... SO easy... pony tail, slide bun thingy on the hair, roll it up, then bend around.  works GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> excellent product fulfills all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;recommend their quality is very good and the price even better.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying him his sevice and attention no comparison.</li>
    <li> Perfect for  5 y.o. girl. She loves it! We buy it 3-4 month ago, it easy for use. She wear it every day!</li>
    <li> These arrived quite fast and they actually look much better than the circular -typical ones-. Can also be used for other hairstyles like a bun in a half pony tail..</li>
    <li> Cheap china knock-off of an As Seen on TV product,  Took almost two months to receive but for what I paid I can&#x27;t complain.  Side by side with the original you can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> This came without any instructions on how to use and they are cheap foam one came apart first time i tried it. I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t going to cost me more to return then what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> i got this product so i can make nice buns, however the metal that is used is very flimsy and does not hold my hair at all, and i dont have thick hair,and it was supposed to come with a style guide, it did not. i would not reccomend to any one.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this! This did not work on my hair. I tried several times, but this bun maker did not stay on my hair.  Also, it is made out of a cheap material. I threw them away the same day I received it. I know it is pretty cheap, but don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get the as seen on TV hot buns but like the price of these better- I was ready to return them as soon as I got them until I watched this video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;The pony tail is key- and bobby pins will certainly help!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know  why people dare to put 2 stars and complain about this $1.09  product,  It works perfectly for me, yes I have long hair, but I have layers too, just make it work... It&#x27;s tricky at first but you need to pull your own hair to the sides so the item can \\&quot;close\\&quot; or \\&quot;wrap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My item came super fast, and it comes in two sizes, thank you so much guys!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with instructions, so not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right.... Looks cute when I try, but doesn&#x27;t look as finished as pictures  :-(</li>
    <li> i like the product itself but it was too short. I have medium length hair and even the long foam sponge didn&#x27;t work. If it was longer i would really like this product</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but decided to pay the $1.09 to give it a try. This product takes a while to arrive since it is shipped from Hong Kong. The key is to first put your hair in a pony tail, place your ponytail through the hole and pull the foam sponge up the to the end of your hair. Roll your hair forward around the foam and then curl it under in the form of a circle to make a bun. I watched a you tube video that was very helpful.&lt;br /&gt; [...] (if the link doesn&#x27;t work simply type in Magic Sponge Foam Clip in the you tube search box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product literally makes a perfect bun in seconds and it stays. I have long, curly hair and the product works great for me. Most hair products don&#x27;t work in my thick unmanageable hair.</li>
    <li> I ended up having to split my hair into two sections and using two of these to keep my hair back.  I also find it works better once i have my hair pulled back with a hair tie into a ponytail before use.</li>
    <li> I was not as pleased with this item for my granddaughters hair. It didn&#x27;t work at all on the high bun.</li>
    <li> This is second time that I order this product. I&#x27;ve tried other similar production like \\&quot;Whirl a style\\&quot; that costs a lot more but was totally not working. I ordered again just to make sure I won&#x27;t run out. And I&#x27;ve given one to my friend who is very excited that it works for her too!&lt;br /&gt;I would give 5 star if it came a little fast. But overall I am very satisfied and will recommand to anyone who wants to make a bun. It is truely magic!</li>
    <li> no directions came with this product. I think it is hard to use. Not even my hair sylist could figure it out.</li>
    <li> When these arrived I was apprehensive. My teenage daughter got hold of them (she used small one I think you would need really thick long hair for the bigger one)  and 10 minutes later she came out with the cutest donut bun on her head! Even being blond it didn&#x27;t show through. Her friends like it because they are using a sock. A .99 purchase made the teenager happy and keeps a sock out of her hair so I&#x27;m happy. I will be ordering more for her friends.</li>
    <li> This is a semi cheaper version I was expecting something different, its ok for people who do not have too much hair but even then it doesn&#x27;t seem like it will hold up long..I would spend a few more dollars and get a better one.</li>
    <li> I reported that this product didn&#x27;t hold my thick hair very well...so, I decided to return it...Well, the owner not only made the refund the next day, she also offered me the product as a present!!! what a great customer service oriented.  I told her that this foam worked perfectly for my friend who has thin hair...so I gave it to her as a gift...she loves it!  It holds her ponytail very well and she say it&#x27;s easy to use..</li>
    <li> After coming across the Qwikbun infomercials on YouTube I became obsessed.  They are quite expensive though so I bought this which I thought would basically be a cheaper version.  Basically, I ended up really liking it and tried going for the real thing so this is how they measure up.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I wasn&#x27;t doing it right but I never could make the full circle bun.  I couldn&#x27;t get the ends to overlap and hair to meet in the middle.  Maybe it&#x27;s because my hair is super super thick and down to my butt long.  I get lovely buns using the Qwikbun but I literally only made half a bun/crescent-moon-shaped bun with this.  Not a problem to me though, I finish it up by tying a scarf around it and making a huge bow :) it makes for a cute and unique look though I think.  So it might look kind of odd by itself but you can really dress it up if you can&#x27;t come full circle like me.&lt;br /&gt;What I really love about it is the fact that it curls my hair so nicely!  The night before or day of a dinner or something like that, I put it in and leave it there, sleep in it and everything for at least 6 hours, no product needed.  Yeah that&#x27;s a while but if you have to wear it out in the mean time like I said you can make it really cute, and the next day you&#x27;ll have the cutest curls too!  Honestly though they only last a few hours at most so I only do it for dinners or something, BUT I also have the most stubbornly straight and thick hair.  No other no heat method can do this for my hair that I have tried and I don&#x27;t like to use curlers because I don&#x27;t want to damage my hair, or burn myself because I&#x27;m a klutz.  If you have anything other than stubborn, straight, thick, Asian hair then this should work for you with much less time and last longer (I would think) especially if you&#x27;ve got products you know work for you with it.&lt;br /&gt;The pack is nice, good deal for four I mean, and the products aren&#x27;t too bad.  They might be a bit delicate though since they are made of foam and I think I&#x27;ve slightlyripped the inside of one (Qwikbuns are longer and have a bigger hole and are more durable, just FYI) but I have used them many times and they&#x27;re still going good.  Taking them out by the way may tug your hair a bit so try to open them up as much as you can before you take them out, on the up-side that means they&#x27;re really hard to knock out of your hair and thus stay in ALL day.  Overall I felt like they were a really good deal for the price.  Nice half buns and lovely soft curls as well (I liked the curl much better from these than the Qwikbuns, bigger and softer looking).  But if you don&#x27;t like the half bun idea and want a professional looking bun, I&#x27;d rather point you towards the Qwikbun or some other method of bun making.  This product I highly recommend though!</li>
    <li> The wire was too soft to hold my hair up like that picture that showing. but i can tight it lower ( on the back of my neck) and it&#x27;s holding up okay.</li>
    <li> The product work as it should and enjoyed using this on myself and friends. I would recommended to other people to make a perfect bun.</li>
    <li> horrible product!!!!!!! smells bad and doesn&#x27;t even hold my thin fine straight hair in place.</li>
    <li> When I recieved them, I didn&#x27;t know what they were. Very cheaply made. I threw them in the trash. These need instructions.</li>
    <li> Much easier than the &#x27;sock bun&#x27;! The small ones I don&#x27;t have any use for (too small for me to use in my hair), but the large ones work fine!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that took less effort. I have long thick hair so it took me a while to get my bun to look as I desired. Otherwise it&#x27;s an okay product but not the best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has thick, curly hair and we just can&#x27;t get them to stay in.  I had high hopes... :(</li>
    <li> Good value.  The bun makers are much less expensive than what I have purchased in the past.  They work as well and seem to have the same longevity.  Wish they made them in a lighter color for blond hair.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid this product works better than average. I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend it though. There is no secure way to keep it bent in the donut position. So throughout the day you have to adjust it. Even with that flaw it makes your bun easy to make and look very good.</li>
    <li> Nope not from china... Do u really think this will help.... Because I thought the same thing... Find something different not from china</li>
    <li> foam is cheap and tore on the first day</li>
    <li> easy to use and comes in a small and big one for thick hair. you need bobby pins for leftover hair.</li>
    <li> it pulls your hair&lt;br /&gt;they are not to easy to put on, and they don&#x27;t look so good on&lt;br /&gt;dont buy it</li>
    <li> Soft versatile and easy to use.  I use this with my daughters they make it easy to make the perfect bun for fine hair.</li>
    <li> It was working great when hair was mid length but now when my hair has grown, it is not able to hold it properly . I wish it was bit bigger .</li>
    <li> With this price, no one can beat this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is really magical.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and makes beautiful bun!!!</li>
    <li> This product was not easy to work with and did not seem to work with thick silky hair.  I threw them in the trash after much frustration.</li>
    <li> These are useless.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, even for a few dollars these are pointless.  Hair donuts are better.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine and straight and I cannot get it to secure, even with hairpins and rubberbands.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much easier it is to do a sock bun with one of these! And you really can&#x27;t beat this price! I think I&#x27;m going to order another set for my niece!</li>
    <li> the weak can hold all my hair and you cant put the bottom together , they can do better .</li>
    <li> Once I researched on YouTube (SuperModels Secrets Tutorial) it showed how to use it and to secure it with a bobby pin.  It has stayed in place all day, despite a VERY windy day and very long thick layered hair.  Yes, it took awhile to ship, which was expected when I ordered so that was fine.  But the results are great, and for the first time my bun hasn&#x27;t given me a headache from all the elastic bands and bobby pins I&#x27;d normally use!</li>
    <li> It is amazing how easy it is to use and how inexpensive for such a great little tool. I ordered both kinds, the plastic and this foam bun maker, and and am pleased with both. It took a time or two for me to master covering my hair in the back, but now I have it down to an art and enjoy having them on hand. I will caution it does not work well if your hair is seriously layered because you may have short sprigs of hair sticking out everywhere. But your hair is more one length like mine, it will work great.</li>
    <li> I had ordered before as a single large piece and this time I got a great deal for four pieces (2 large and 2 small). I also ordered extra. The product helps really curl my hair when used. I have a natural wave in my hair and when used I don&#x27;t have to use curlers as sometime I get headaches with them and with these I do not have any problems and I can sleep in them.</li>
    <li> This is just not worth. I did not get any use out of it. It does not hold my hair or looks good. Not a good bun</li>
    <li> Was a little late getting here. And doesn&#x27;t quite stay in my hair like I hoped. But that&#x27;s not the sellers fault :)</li>
    <li> Made in China....thought it was the same as I have always gotten.  Do not like it.  Buy American...always better...tired of China owning us!</li>
    <li> The item I received is totally different from what I ordered! Unfortunately the return shipping will cost more than the refund but this thing is going straight to the garbage. Cheap plastic made for unknown to me reason totally different from the item on the picture. Hate it! Never ordering again from this seller</li>
    <li> I have thin, straight hair in long layers, a couple inches below my shoulders.  Especially now that I&#x27;m getting older, closer to 50, it never wants to stay in any style except for ponytails.  I got this in the mail (after several weeks--I honestly had forgotten I had ordered it!) and couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first.  After watching You-Tube videos, though, I got the gist of it, and it took all of about 2 minutes to put in the next day.  Just pull your hair into a pony tail with an elastic, pull the hair throught the slot and tighten, and slide the tool about 3/4 of the way down your ponytail.  Then, just roll it up with the hair even around it till it reaches your scalp, bend the ends around, and cover the ends with your hair.  That&#x27;s it!!  My hair stayed all day long and didn&#x27;t budge.  It must have been slightly damp, because when i took the tool out that night, my hair was a ridiculously curly mass, which I guess could have been nice in a pony tail, but straightened out after brushing.  I think I used the small (I hadn&#x27;t realized there were 2 separate sizes till just now), which made a bun about the size of my fist.  Not sure what the larger one would look like, since my hair is thin and blonde.  Youtube also has some great tips.  After all the expensive barrettes, clips, hairbands--I finally have something simple and professional.</li>
    <li> like it, it look very beautiful! my wife say it look ok, so i give this review  about this case!</li>
    <li> My hair got tangle multiple times</li>
    <li> This product could of been a little more comfortable and made of a better quality and it&#x27;d not for thick hair at all. Better to use on little girls</li>
    <li> I have the Sarah Potempa and was looking for a cheaper option. I thought these would be the same, but they are definitely a much cheaper version. The metal in them is not as sturdy and they don&#x27;t seem to hold my hair the way the other ones do.</li>
    <li> Does not hold up even my daughters fine, child hair.  Material pulls the fine hairs as well.  Good in theory but I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Alright but would never buy again.</li>
    <li> These look like they would work well, but in fact they don&#x27;t work at all. They are too rigid to get your hair into easily. They don&#x27;t stay closed well once you&#x27;re hair is wound around it.</li>
    <li> I love them. It is the easy and super fast way how to make your hair look elegant in few seconds. Forget those big sponges in your hair. This is what you need. Long shipping, but great price</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described, easy to use, adds extra volume to thin hair, even for children.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have  medium length dreadlocks. It wont hold my hair at ALL. There is another similar product on the market that has a made in elastic band to actually secure the bun. Seems like a better product than this one</li>
    <li> This was at a very good price but was very cheap material and didn&#x27;t even make a bun so i ended up throwing them away</li>
    <li> so they do add volume to the bun however you have to work with it not to visible. but they are really cheap so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
    <li> This worked well (not as well as the videos or pictures), but still was easy to use.  There is a flat wire underneath a cheap foam.  I have used this to decent results on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  The longer the hair, the better this will work.  It will not work well on hair the is not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big downside is that you can only use one a couple times before the wire inside doesn&#x27;t go back to it&#x27;s original position and gets all out of shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for this (four pieces for a couple bucks - two small and two large), so it was a good value.  I will post a picture of using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair for her dance recital (which is one time where it came out well - lots of gel and hairspray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent value but mediocre product (well, cheap product, but for the value, not too bad).</li>
    <li> I am still learning how to style my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair for dance class. These gadgets are great for easily creating the perfect bun. The smaller size is perfect for my daughter&#x27;s fine, medium length hair.</li>
    <li> I can get it to work when my hair is wet. But when it dries, it doesnt hold and i cannot grt it back in. Ive always had trouble with my hair bc it is very silky. I have long medium thick layered hair. If u have layers, this will not work very well. U got to get a bit creative if u want to use it in layered hair. Like use bows and ribbons, clips, etc. U have to pull this thing to the end of ur ponytail, but if it is layered, u can only pull it to the end of ur shortest layer or else ur shortest layers will fall out and not get in the bun</li>
    <li> The material was ok. I didn&#x27;t expect much of the product given the price was so cheap. The product did serve its purpose.</li>
    <li> You are better off buying the foam donut to make a bun. This thing does not make a proper bun</li>
    <li> REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;I really like these bun makers and I plan to order more. They are better made than I expected. The wire inside is sturdy enough to hold my hair all day and night (my hair is about 8 inches below my shoulders, layered and semi-fine textured). I want to order more because they are inexpensive enough and I would like to have back ups just in case. I would recommend these to anyone because they are so simple to use! They don&#x27;t come with instructions but I will explain how to use them below for anyone interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HELPFUL TIPS&lt;br /&gt;I find these work best on hair that was washed the day before. Freshly washed hair is a bit too soft.&lt;br /&gt;1. Put hair into a ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;2. Spread the bun maker and place your pony tail through it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Squeeze the bun maker closed around your pony tail to make a tighter fit.&lt;br /&gt;4. Pull the bun maker to roughly 3/4 the length of your pony tail (I go about halfway because of my layers).&lt;br /&gt;5. Roll your hair down until it touches your head and bend the bun maker into a circle.&lt;br /&gt;6. Spread your hair evenly over the bun maker until it is completely covered.&lt;br /&gt;I find it helpful to secure the hair closed around the bun maker with a bobby pin or a clear elastic to hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it! The whole thing takes about a minute. Less with practice. There are lots of youtube videos too that helped me. Just search &amp;#34;sponge or foam bun maker&amp;#34; and lots of things come up. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Did not like...not long enough to twist and tuck...foam rubber not cloth like I expected</li>
    <li> I just got it today and it seens to work fine! It looks a little cheap but fot the price you are paying its more than ok! Its on my hair rigth now its not that hard to use if you follow the steps !</li>
    <li> The two sizes are great since I have short hair at the moment and it still works. It makes my bun look natural instead of the doughnut method.</li>
    <li> I still cant quite figure it out and the wire inside it is very hard. also, i hate the material it&#x27;s made with... i can&#x27;t stand this kind of foam, it gives me goosebumps. (those people who can&#x27;t stand cotton balls and stuff like that will understand what i mean)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still, it was $2 so i cant complain too much.</li>
    <li> i use these everynight for putting my hair up when i sleep at night, i don&#x27;t like to lay on my long hair because i end up pulling it.  thanks</li>
    <li> I spend so much putting it on my hair, and my hair is still not what it looked like in the picture. maybe it&#x27;s me, i do a better job with two hair ties than with the help of this sponge clip. however, for the price, it&#x27;s still worth a shot. the package comes in 4 different sizes of sponge clip, so you can decide how big of a donut bun you want on your hair (if you know how to use)</li>
    <li> These work fine,, but I wish they came in a lighter color....I&#x27;m blonde and it&#x27;s hard to hide the dark form.</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK!!!! its literally a pice of foam covering some wire and its just horrible&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> this bun maker was awesome but they brake really fast.overall,worth the money but not the wait........also this product is perfect for a quick hairstyle</li>
    <li> It was Not as good as I have expected it to be but for the price I paid for it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I really like the design and it works very well. It&#x27;s not as stiff as the Remington one I got at Walmart but these are a fraction in price</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted works well if you have common sense. Makes a very pretty uniform bum :) :) :) :) :) :) :)</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the TODAY show, and was impressed by how quick and easy it looked to make a beautiful hair bun. When I tried it, I was still impressed! It really is just as simple to use as they showed on TV. The set included 2 large and 2 small clips, so I shared one of each with a friend who just loves them. Great product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use and created the perfect bun! Great for an amazing updo without any effort! I know what I&#x27;ll be putting in all of the girls&#x27; stockings this year!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after trying the other styles of bun-makers, and this style is the only one my daughters and I use.  There were 4 in the package, 2 small and 2 larger, and both sizes work well and long semi-thick hair.  These are easy enough for my kids to do themselves too.  They are the softest and most comfortable of all the bun-makers, as the bendable part is firm but flexible, and covered in a very soft foam material that helps hold your hair in place as you are winding up the hair.  We use these daily to keep our hair up for sports and dance and they work the best.</li>
    <li> These probably cost one cent to make so considering the dollar or so I spent on them and the month+ it took them to get here, I would say go to Ulta, pay another 2 or 3 bucks and get better ones. My 12 year old step daughter messes with them in her hair a lot but they don&#x27;t stay in long.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this! I like to do bumper bangs, and wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work well, especially for that price. But when I got them, I tried them, and they worked GREAT! Shipping was a small wait, but worth it.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this occasionally. It does as it says, but works best with long hair and really thick hair. If you have fine hair, it might not hold. Finish the look with some hairspray for hold.</li>
    <li> too messy to make a bun cant keep it together</li>
    <li> The quality isn&#x27;t so great but it does it&#x27;s job. I bought them to make waves on my hair but it didn&#x27;t work out so if you&#x27;re interested on these because you want curls it&#x27;s probably not going to work. The buns do come out very nice if you have short hair. It&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> You really need to have very dark hair for these and a lot of it, the smaller of the two work the best, but I needed help to hide it,maybe with practice</li>
    <li> not as thick as i would have hoped it to be. I have long hair and the large tool wasn&#x27;t quite big enough for my volume of hair. I may use this product or I may end on throwing it out.</li>
    <li> Loved the product!  I&#x27;ve had it for a long time now.  Around one yr.  It Still Has It&#x27;s form.  I thought by now the wires would be worn out but they are not and still make beautiful buns!  For the price I&#x27;m really surprised with this nifty product!</li>
    <li> The item was supposed to be 4 items and only two arrived and it took so long to get here (a fact that was not disclosed til I was ready to buy) that I decided not to bother with returning it</li>
    <li> Was cheap so I thought I&#x27;d give them a try. I took one and my teenager took one.  I am by no means a hairstylist.  I have rather long hair and try after try could not get this to work for me.  Some parts of my hair were in there tight while others were hanging loosely. My daughter couldn&#x27;t get her style to look right either. Whether it is the product or the &#x27;user&#x27;, I&#x27;m not sure, but I don&#x27;t see it as a total waste of money though. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try these, and am just glad I didn&#x27;t spend any more on them than I did.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well with shoulder length hair. So am going to have to wait and grow my hair longer,</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with instructions so it was a waste to me.</li>
    <li> cheap and not made well. threw it away upon opening. i do not recommend anyone purchasing this. very very disappointed</li>
    <li> Nice to fill up thin hair in a bun... my daughters looks nice and thick using this foam spunge clip.</li>
    <li> No instructions and kinda shoddy construction. it was rather cheap so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. Couldn&#x27;t even use it in my hair - gave it to a friend to mess with.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as well for thicker hair. Think it would be a good product for someone with thinner or shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Woww truth is fantastic ... Super easy to use and makes it look super-executive, stylish, fascinated me ... I am happy with my purchase ... The delivery arrived on time .. thanks</li>
    <li> it came with a couple of them. but the stupid thing about it is .it didn&#x27;t come with instructions.hopefully theres directions on the internet somewhere</li>
    <li> I wanted a cute hairstyle that was practical for yoga class and my daily life. As soon as I opened the package, I created a bun. I did five jumping jacks and the bun stayed in place (I have fine hair). It gave a &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; bull that added some body. It will most definitely be adorable after I actually style my hair. I did not know I could do a french twist with this product (spent over $10 this week in pharmacies purchasing goody and conair accessories to attempt to do the french twist. ALL WERE TERRIBLE). I am excited to give this a try. I am hoping it works. Great product for such a great price!</li>
    <li> Great item, for a great price..compare to others sold else where more expensive..perfect for longer hair lenghts, works well fast and easy..</li>
    <li> It took a little while to get to my home, but I loved it.  It is extremely hard to find so I am glad you had it available.  Thank you</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been months and I still have notreceived this item. so you might say I&#x27;m not happy &amp; please dont order this.</li>
    <li> i love how easily i can make a perfect or messy buns..absolutely lovee it got it 10 days earlier than expected</li>
    <li> simple-pretty-stylish and easy to use it. the big size is better for my heavy hair. if you have a lot of hair like me buy the big size.</li>
    <li> my bun turned out perfectly.  I used the larger one as I have longer hair.  Literally took me 2 minutes to put my hair in a perfect bun.  got many compliments on my hair.  Shipped super fast!</li>
    <li> Good product, keeps bun in tight only need a few bobby pins. Recommend! Great for a night out or business function.</li>
    <li> I am super happy with my magic foam sponge clips! Not only to I get the PERFECT bun!!! I get the cutest curls!!! I can wear my hair with cut curls without any effort !!! If I ever need more I am DEFFENTLY get them from here !!!</li>
    <li> But they&#x27;ll serve their purpose. I just wish they were a little better made, so they&#x27;d last longer. But they&#x27;ll serve through a few uses, especially if I&#x27;m careful.</li>
    <li> It kept falling off and your hair will come with it I even try on my daughter she said she didn&#x27;t like it it is very wear tell tell me to take right off and I try not to pull her hairs but the thing did anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried to use it once or twice but I haven&#x27;t had any luck, I have thick layered hair and I just can&#x27;t get it to hold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s foam wrapped around metal wiring, so the more you use this, the more it warps over time... making it ineffective.</li>
    <li> The product in itself is very good, versatile and gives your a few options for hair up do&#x27;s, but the image of this product is misleading as when I bought it I thought I was getting two of them.</li>
    <li> The product is much smaller than expected. You get the 2 smaller ones of the picture shown. May be easy and convenient to carry but definitely not easy and convenient to use. The picture shows some type of clip to hold it together, the product doesn&#x27;t have anything to hold it together. The product is just a piece of wire with sponge over it, not very flexible. It doesn&#x27;t hold the bun together, comes apart pretty quickly. Got it today and thought perfect timing, since I was on my way out. Took some time to get the bun just right and then it fell out before I left the house. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> i really like this product. this is the first time that i can acutally wear a bun to work and it stay put  all day! i have tried two other products that were similar but my silky hair never stayed put in it. this is easy to use. takes 5 minutes or less and it gives ur bun more volume. would definately recommend</li>
    <li> Easy to use, however does not hold up so well on long hair.</li>
    <li> In addition to trying to read the cartoon instructions, I googled it, but I just, don&#x27;t get it :( That, or it&#x27;s justs a little too difficult for layered hair.</li>
    <li> i have very long thick corse hair -this works very good i use as a pony tail holder it does not hurt my scalp</li>
    <li> I have long thin hair. I used to use the hairdini to put my hair in a bun. This product is cheaply made and does not hold my hair at all. If I had spent more than a dollar on it, I would ask for a refund!</li>
    <li> Made of a flimsy piece of metal wrapped in foam. Does not even work. I gave them to my children to play with as soon as I opened the package. Now they are in the trash.</li>
    <li> the onbly problem is they don&#x27;t come in yellow for us blondes:) i wish we could have gotten all four small also cause our hair is not that thick. but they do work and are very easy to use, and after wards the curles are very beautiful, especially if you have longer hair, and you do them in two Princess Leiya type buns on the sides of your head.have fun with them I highly reccomend this product - I think I will be buying a few more very soon :) some for me some for my mom and my daughter already has some! God Bless Everyone!</li>
    <li> i had something like this many many years ago and used it all the time. these are just foam covered wires and I dont like the way they bend</li>
    <li> Completely useless. Would have given it no star at all if was given an option.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Star Wars, I love the bun &#x27;do. They&#x27;re beautiful / pretty / gorgeous. I tried to tell my GF that but she doesn&#x27;t like buns. She DID say, however, that she does like Anne Reinking as Grace Farrell&#x27;s low bun-roll in &#x60;Annie&#x27; (1982) and might try it herself. I got these for her just in case she really does want to try to do her hair up.</li>
    <li> dont use them they dont make a bun the instructions are in chinese so u wont understand they are useless</li>
    <li> Received the set yesterday with no instructions, so I have no idea how to use them...very frustrating although it was an inexpensive purchase.  It would be really helful to customers to include at least one small page of \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; instructions.</li>
    <li> well after 1 use of these each the sponge material tore and the metal is exposed was cheap yet still not worth it</li>
    <li> Although she tries to get it perfect sometimes there&#x27;s a cheesecake slice shape at the bottom of the bun that she hates, but overall it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Shipping takes 3 weeks and the product is ok.  it needs a closure at the end to help secure the bun.  I sewed on a snap and it really helped.</li>
    <li> This is the worst and horrible hair styling bun.Its got weak edges which doesn&#x27;t hold your hair even when straight forget when it&#x27;s a bun! DO NOT BUY IT!! SAVE YOUR DOLLARS</li>
    <li> I was finally able to style my hair as a bun, I always failed before I had this product so I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> Watching YouTube &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; [Easy Bun Hair Bun Maker - Girls Deals] made this a great purchase that works like a charm. Would have been nicer if it came w/English instructions. Can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
    <li> it works but have not mastered making the bun yet..can&#x27;t seem to get my hair in the bun shape. hopefully will learn how.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product, but it is terrible. The wire is too weak to hold my hair on all four pieces. I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Well it may be me and my type of hair but it is extremely difficult to form a bun or make stay in place. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I thought that this product was going to come with some details or some detailed information to assist with using the product.  It is not like a product I had years ago that you just roll and fold (stayed in place by itself).</li>
    <li> These dont hold up in heavy hair.</li>
    <li> construction can be better</li>
    <li> A little hard to get the hang of but I like that you can get a tighter looking bun. Almost like a ballerina bun. I like it alot and for the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Just got these in the mail. My package arrived damage (with post office disclaimer), but the product inside was in perfect condition.  However, there were no instructions or packing sheet, am assuming when post office ate the package they ate my paperwork, but a quick online search led me to instructions and lots of fun ideas.  I have waist length, straight, thin hair and I rolled it up in a large and then went about my day.  The hair didn&#x27;t fall out, I didn&#x27;t have to stop and repair my bun (like I have to when I use bobby pins) and I was happy.  Haven&#x27;t tried the smaller size yet, but am assuming it will work as well.  I recommend the internet search for ideas on use, saw some fun hair styles I want to try with these.  I didn&#x27;t see a better price anywhere though!</li>
    <li> Good for just one time use.&lt;br /&gt;Second time won&#x27;t work as good, third time won&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;The wire inside this stuff will all be tangled..&lt;br /&gt;Just get it for one or max is two three times.&lt;br /&gt;When it works, it is really pretty^*^</li>
    <li> all great, I was happy with the item and what I paid for it. No regrets. I would recommend to others.10</li>
    <li> after several attempts, i finally got this to work. once you get the hang of it, you will use this all the time. my hair is about 4 inches past my sholders and layered; the longer sponge works best. its super inexpensive and works better than a sock. ive gotten a lot of complements on my bun when i use this product.</li>
    <li> ES un producto muy bueno, me encanta, es facil de utilizar, practico y a un excelente precio. Con esto no necesito da&amp;ntilde;ar mi cabello con secadores no pinzas electricas.</li>
    <li> These are probably wonderful but I have no idea how best to use them.  Would be really helpful if they came with instruction or a few photos.</li>
    <li> when i got it there was no instructions. and the bun things are really cool. and they leave a lot of hair out. i will change my product reveiw if i get a refund. i like them a lot but they leave my hair out</li>
    <li> I have long, thin and very silky hair. Creating a top bun is a dream for me as nothing can hold my hair up and together. To create a top bun, I have to use a few rubber bands and lots of spin pins. But that wouldn&#x27;t give me neat bun. I was hoping that this product would do it but it is very cheaply made and worked only for a 3-4 time in the beginning and then the wire stopped working as it used to be so now it&#x27;s useless for me.</li>
    <li> Since it is very difficult to find hairdini products anymore, this is a decent substitute.  It is no where near as sturdy as the hairdini, but for the price it is worth it for that &amp;#34;thick bun&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> I got this item today after seeing many women with their buns like perfect little donuts when using this product. I was so excited to put my hair up like that and when I got the products it was a joke. I have long curly hair (3/4 down my back) and even though I have alot of it is is pretty fine. Either this thing has instructions somewhere that explain how to use it or it is completely useless. It is a piece of foam over some wire so how hard can it be right?  After I finally got all of my hair wrapped around it and twisted to my head, when you fold in the ends to complete the bun, they don&#x27;t stay in place because it is so flimsy.  I used it on my 3 yr old daughter and it works beautifully for her but for me, it is a waste. I&#x27;ll keep looking....</li>
    <li> Okay, for the simple fact that it actually does hold up my full ponytail is the only reason why I&#x27;m giving this a two star. Other  than that, considering I didn&#x27;t even get all four, and the seller that I bought and received my bun thing from was crappy, I suppose a dollar was worth seeing if something like this would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rather thick, heavy hair, although it&#x27;s not quite as long as another reviewer said hers was. Hence, I didn&#x27;t have much a problem with it actually holding my hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from it being a cheap thing, the only really bad thing about it (other than it smelling like gasoline when I received it, not getting all four, and then not getting a refund) is the fact that the ends keep spreading apart. But I suppose that could be fixed by pinning them together with a bobby pin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a dollar, not bad. But I will be getting a better one, and one with hooks to hold it together.</li>
    <li> I could see them working for long, thin hair. They definitely didn&#x27;t keep this soft, thick hair up! Still looking for a cuter way to put my hair up that&#x27;s not just a pony tail.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and long.  This product would work great for someone with thinner hair, otherwise the bun will look big and silly.</li>
    <li> seems like a Good product but for thin hair. I have really thick hair so I was unable to use these. However, the price was just right and the item will work as long as your hair is not really thick.</li>
    <li> This product has NO way of staying in the hair. There were no instructions to give any hint as to how one is supposed to keep this in their hair. I would not recommend this. There are other, similarly priced products that will get the job done right.</li>
    <li> I hoped this item would help me make cute double buns. They don&#x27;t work at all. The metal inside the foam is very stiff  so the don&#x27;t shape well.</li>
    <li> It would have been nice if it had directions on how to use it.  I twisted it and tried but it didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried one of the pieces the covering tore and now it&#x27;s no good! I wasn&#x27;t ruff with it, it was just attempting to bend it around my hair.</li>
    <li> I loved it. I am able to do an easy french twist. Very easy to use and you can do the different sizes.</li>
    <li> Not only it makes a good donut bun but also does make really good curl to my hair without using a hair roller.</li>
    <li> Arrived quick,product as described! Having two is soooo nice!</li>
    <li> It comes with 2 large and 2 small, use the larger one for longer hair.  It is great for really long hair and awesome for a ballerina.</li>
    <li> I have long hair . I really like this thingy . I tried it and after about 2 trys I got it in just fine and it stayed in . I love it . It held my hair all day ,and it was not tight like an elastic so it was very comfortable and it looked very neat. Glad I have it . Its made of inexpensive foam covered wire..</li>
    <li> I have thin hair all one length.  I love it,</li>
    <li> It was what I EXPECTED &amp; I was so excited when it came in the mail. To inform you it does take as long as it said it does in the mail. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Who&#x27;d hair is this thing supposed to wrap up? a Barbie doll? What was I thinking?! I feel like I gave a donation to these people in exchange for packing peanuts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wondered how girls get that great bun. I have super thin hair and this product did the trick. Very easy to use. Arrived early too.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  Product issues:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Foam is inferior quality.  Disintegrated when I tried it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Does not work for long hair past the shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;3.  After many attempts to roll my hair up, the ends would not hold together and would snap open&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> This produce is cheaply made. The metal rod stick out and poke my hand when I try to bend it.&lt;br /&gt;Worst product every bought.</li>
    <li> I have tried the hot buns and similar products before and they never really worked. Got this on promotion and they actually worked pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this.  I&#x27;m sorry to say but I must be truthful.  It&#x27;s wire and foam.  That&#x27;s all.  Not very well made</li>
    <li> this product is just what I need in my hair supply drawer. I didn&#x27;t really want to use the suck method to put my hair in a bun because I was afraid it would not be at thick as I wanted. I was happy to find this alternative. When I received the product I watched a tutorial on youtube on how to use it. I was able to put my hair in a bun with no issues. After a long day I decided to leave the bun in my hair over night and wrap it with a scarf so I would not have to do it the next morning. I was so shocked to discover that this bun make gave my hair beautiful curls with lots of volume after I took it out!!! The product does not look like it will last very long but for $0.95 who cares!! You can always order another four without hurting your wallet.</li>
    <li> The item is great,  just took a long time to get here.</li>
    <li> I bought these to put my hair up when I work out and they work perfectly once u get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I have to get the hang of it but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Very nice and convenient</li>
    <li> These are not even remotely comparable to the long-lost Hairdini. I thought the slot in the center would be an improvement but it&#x27;s not. Also, the metal inside is pretty flimsy so when you are twisting they are flopping back and forth. You&#x27;re better off just lamenting the loss of the hairdini and moving on with your life.</li>
    <li> I loooove this product ! It just took a while to arrive</li>
    <li> Meh. Not really worth it. It broke after first use</li>
    <li> Crap. My hair comes midway to my boobs and is fine. These do not work well at all of you have long hair. For such a cheap price there&#x27;s really no loss here but I&#x27;d rather buy a chocolate bar instead.</li>
    <li> These did not work great with my hair. It would always come undone.</li>
    <li> worthy to buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I did not realize there was two big hair twist and two small ones... Even better!! The small hair twist does not quite hold my hair up because i have long asain hair, but the larger one works so well. I love throwing my hair into a bun every morning. Its so cheap so I cant complain on the cheap foam wrapped around the bendable metal. It works so well my fianc&amp;eacute; says my bun looks fake!! Awesome!!</li>
    <li> This product does what it&#x27;s supossed to do but after a while of use, it&#x27;s not gonna be the same as you got it because it is a foam sponge; you might over stretch it like I did because of my thick hair. I give this 4 stars, because it did take almost a month to arrive but other than that, I would recommend this product to friends and family. I love how it makes my hair look extra big when I wear this product.</li>
    <li> It comes with 2 small ones and 2 big ones. Now in the morning, it takes me only 5 min. to make a perfect bun. I love this product. You can use only a half of your top hairs to make a small bun and let other parts lay down or you can use a big one to make a big bun on the top in the summer. If you sleep with it( a big bun on the top), you get nice curls in the morning when you unrewind! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the wires inside bend and it doesn&#x27;t go back to exactly the way it used to be, but it still works well. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i love this product, its just so  handy and easy, helps my long hair tied in a bun through out the day and makes very beautiful, clean bun. works very nicely. love it!</li>
    <li> I thought that these would be a little smaller in length, but that&#x27;s my own fault for not reading the dimensions.</li>
    <li> Just received this yesterday, seems a little challenging for medium hair with a few layers....but works ok....for the price I am sure it can be used.</li>
    <li> I purchased magic foam sponge clip at the same time as the donut-shape bun maker. The sponge clip is much easier to use and gives as good result as the donut bun maker (some people use old socks to make a donut). Moreover, the sponge clip doesn&#x27;t require anything else to hold up the bun, while the donut bun maker requires hairpins, rubber band, etc..</li>
    <li> not for long hair. weight of hair is too much for product to stay in place. maybe for children with lighter weight or thinner hair. inner wire mechanism not strong at all. good price though!</li>
    <li> These things are great!!!  Very easy to use and adds lots of fullness to my naturally thin hair.  I have red hair and, although these are black, they are not visible through my locks when hairs are adjusted correctly over the piece.</li>
    <li> i loved them i use the large ones in my hair and i use the small ones in my 4 year olds hair</li>
    <li> I grabbed these for my 6 year old. They work well, are decent quality, and do what they say they will. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is mislead! First of all it ships from Hong Kong so it takes longer than a month to get and it is 4 pieces but it does not have the bug style one just the long black ones. Overall they work but the material is cheap and looks like it will break fast! But its cheap so why not?</li>
    <li> I was expecting somewhat different quality and material, but for its price -- it&#x27;s a good product and it definitively does its job. I just had a different kind in the past. This material is not something you would want everyone one to see -- but when you actually do the hair-- the SpongeClip is not seen, and the hair looks good. So overall -- a good one.</li>
    <li> I have extremely long hair so it makes it a little harder for the donut to hold my hair but for the price of it I am okay with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Took too long to arrive and does not work as easiely as shown. Better to purchase locally so you can return</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how short your hair is this will work to make you a very nice and neat bun. For you moms that have toddlers starting in ballet and your daughters hair is on the short side this will work. The seller was quick to send it out. Would definitely use this seller again</li>
    <li> This product does not work for really long or just short hair in general. It is not worth the money. I recommend hot buns.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t really get it to work in my hair. It was worth a try. Good thing it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
    <li> Not good for long thick hair. I tried it on my daughter and it didn&#x27;t work. I tried it on myself and it still didn&#x27;t work. She has long thick hair, I have short thick hair. I think it may work for thin hair, I don&#x27;t know. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> i wish if they make it longer for long hair people ...i like the idea but my hair needs longer clip .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use. My hair is cut in layers, and it was easy to use. I like it! Makes my hair look cute.</li>
    <li> THESE JUST HURT GOING IN AND WHILE THEY ARE IN YOUR HAIR. ONE STARTED FALLING APART IMMEDIATELY!!! I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> These are fun but kind of difficult to use</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  Makes a bun, easy..peasy!!  Works gr8!!!  If u&#x27;ve tried other bun forms that haven&#x27;t worked give this a try.  I think u&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.  This works much better &amp; more easily than others I&#x27;ve tried.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> IT SUCKED....its made up cheap metal -.- don&#x27;t buyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy because its so not worth it. just a waste of time!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> spent $.99 to buy 4 of these puppies, including shipping.  Can&#x27;t beat that deal.  And they do what I wanted them to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry. I could not ever figure out or get the hang of how to use these items. I finally just gave them to the grand kids to play with</li>
    <li> Great product, super fast shipping. Works really well to hold my hair out of my face all day for work. I&#x27;ve used it to put my hair in a bun or to create a French twist. Even with my super fine hair, it holds very well.</li>
    <li> I like the different uses of this tool. Not only is it good for buns,  its also great for an easy French twist.</li>
    <li> Ya, its inexpensive but it is also cheap. The thing does not connect and my hair falls out. it will not close at the end and looks ridiculous. I will proceed to kill it with fire.</li>
    <li> Dont buy this  I order 2 set of this but this not working and 2hour later its fell down oh my got its  junk and I  through away alraedy</li>
    <li> I like this product. It comes with four bun makers which is great because a lot of us can use them all at once and it was a great bargain. but it took a while for them to arrive at my house.</li>
    <li> First of all i loved that these bun makers came wayy before their due dates. The price was a bonus too since these cost  up to 6$  each! On here i got 4 for almost $2! What a bargain. They were in great shape and fit my buns look soo much better now. THe only problem was that when i would twist them they would open up but no biggie i can stick a few bobby pins in and they are set.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It makes my bun look very natural looking. The quality is OK, and the bun looks really pretty. The delivery date was really fast and I use this product wherever I go. It is easy to use and it is very comfortable. I feel no pain in my hair. I recommend this product to people who want a natural looking bun.</li>
    <li> No instructions on how to use it, the ends do not connect so there is a big chuck of it sticking out the back of your bun.</li>
