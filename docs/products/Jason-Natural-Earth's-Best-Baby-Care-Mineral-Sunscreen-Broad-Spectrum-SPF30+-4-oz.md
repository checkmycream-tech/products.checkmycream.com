      <li>Great, because it&#x27;s mineral based.</li>
      <li>We keep buying it because we feel it has the best coverage and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m happy with it :)</li>
      <li>For kids who don&#x27;t mind being a sort of bluish-white color, or those who will tolerate being rubbed quite a bit when you apply it, it will do a great job keeping them safe.  </li>
      <li>It works well and is chemical free--which we love!  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery is also good.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use a toxic one for myself:)</li>

      <li>This is a wonderful sunblock, especially for kids.</li>

      <li>To top it off, I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
      <li>My daughter looked like she belonged in a zombie movie even after many attempts and rubbing the lotion in.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite sunblock.  </li>
      <li>Seems like it&#x27;s working great so far! :)</li>
      <li>Also, it goes on a very bright white color that no amount of rubbing seems to make fade.</li>
      <li>but it went on easily.</li>
      <li>We switched to Badger active though as the Earth&#x27;s best doesn&#x27;t absorb as well and stained some clothes.</li>
      <li>While I do prefer the older formula, this is still the best natural sunscreen I have found.  </li>
      <li>This is a good mineral sunblock and worth the higher cost in my book.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
      <li>On our trip to Hawaii, we purchased five types of safe sunscreens considered safe by the Environmental Working Group ([...]), in order to do our own \\&quot;research\\&quot; on the effectiveness and ease of use for each product and settle on one for all our future trips.</li>
      <li>I just wanted to advise others who are looking for a chemical free product</li>
      <li>During the summer vacation, I used it very useful.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>This sunblock went on easy and did the job in the hot Texas sun.</li>
      <li>I wanted to buy a chemical free sunscreen for my 12 month old daughter and as far as fulfilling that wish, the product succeeds.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it does the job successfully as a sunblock because the cream is so thick,</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen for my little one.</li>
      <li>Natural is always better, thank you</li>
      <li>My toddler has sensitive skin and reacts to most sunscreens (skin turns bright pink where sunscreen applied -</li>
      <li>Of the five products we tested, this was absolutely the most effective, even for one of our extremely sun-sensitive group members.  </li>
      <li>Of course, he is a big fan of the newer aerosol-types that are so fast and easy :)</li>
      <li>Have used it on myself as well, due to my sensitive skin and worked great for me too.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item because it indicates it is all natural and chemical free.</li>
      <li>(Since this is a physical sunscreen, I want it to be the top layer.)</li>
      <li>Finally, it didn&#x27;t even come off in the water, although you might want to re-apply after swimming just to be on the safe side.</li>
      <li>I read reviews that suggested this was among the best, but I am not impressed.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this item because i wanted the most natural ingredients while being protecting item for my new baby.  </li>
      <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t matter, right ?)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and protects well, but is not too think, not greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a white coat on the skin.  </li>
      <li>R Us is very competitive, esp.</li>
      <li>Haha.  </li>
      <li>You can also find this product at Babies R Us and Whole Foods Market.</li>
      <li>I use it on my face very liberally and it is not greasy and does not cause any breakouts or chemical sensitivity reactions.  </li>
      <li>We later uncovered that my husband had the same allergy reaction to certain chemicals in most of the sunscreen/sun blockers too, even the ones for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It is difficult to put on but it stays pretty well with water and rubbing and provides good protection.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are natural, but it is not completely chemical free.</li>
      <li>I am not in the process of trying out new brands but will use this one when I don&#x27;t plan on taking any pictures.      </li>
      <li>Our girls have sensitive skin - this has worked well and we have not have any issues with burning (or even tanning!).</li>
      <li>My only real issue with this product is the high price.</li>
      <li>REALLY wish it came in larger bottles!</li>
      <li>My product was old (almost expired).  </li>
      <li>Seemed to be a couple of years old.</li>
      <li>My 3 year old tolerated product</li>
      <li>I returned it and reordered, and received another just as old.  </li>
      <li>the bottle is easy to hold to dispense the thick cream.  </li>
      <li>(You may see these first two sentences when we review the other products.</li>
      <li>The white color can be rubbed in if you apply it in thin layers and rub each in completely before applying more.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not scented, which is certainly what some people would want, but because of that, it smells just a little off.</li>
      <li>Both my kids had a \\&quot;blueish\\&quot; tint to them after using the product, but I have seen the same look with other products such as the new Johnson &amp; Johnson baby cream with SPF 50.</li>

<li> They kept giving me one excuse after another and would promise me that the sunscreen had been shipped, but then a week later something else would come up.  </li>
<li> The lotion was very strange in texture- gritty and not like lotion at all.  </li>
<li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face due to the thickness.</li>
<li> I should have listened to the other reviews stating that it will leave your baby looking a bit blue.  </li>
<li> So basically my son walks around the beach looking like a little white ghost!  </li>
<li> It does not seem to irritate my kids sensitive skin nearly as much as other sunscreens (even other mineral sunscreens) and the smell is not overwhelming.  </li>
<li> No one had a reaction to the ingredients, which was what we expected based on other reviews.  </li>
<li> like I was that this is not exactly the case.</li>

<li> I have opted to switch products mainly due to my baby&#x27;s break outs on this sunblock.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that I do have to do a lot of rubbing to make it blend into my skin, but I think it&#x27;s comparable to all mineral-based sunblocks.</li>
<li> It was thick enough</li>
<li> Too thick and too white!</li>
<li> it worked extremely well, but definitely left my arms and legs looking a little white-ish after applying and was a bit of a chore to put on because it is so thick.</li>
<li> My face is allergic to every other sunblock out on the market today, so this is a life-saver!</li>
<li> Only thing is the creme is a little thick.</li>
<li> I apply this one on my little girls (toddler/pre-school) because I don&#x27;t mind taking the time</li>
<li> But the texture of it is very thick and my husband complains it is too hard to rub in completely.  </li>
<li> and though it does not completely rub in at least you can see where you have covered!</li>
<li> I used it because I spent so much on it, but I was extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> My only issue with it was that it is sooo thick that it&#x27;s hard to rub into my child&#x27;s skin within feeling like I&#x27;m rubbing his skin off with it!  </li>
<li> so so small for the price</li>
<li> It works as well as ordinary sunscreen.</li>
<li> Even if you don&#x27;t try and make the white cream disappear, the thick nature of the cream meant that it was actually uncomfortable for me to apply, pulling my skin as I tried to smear it on.</li>
<li> The problem is how thick it is and the fact that it does not disappear even with repeated massaging of it into your skin.</li>
<li> that it&#x27;s impossible to blend it into your skin without leaving a white residue.</li>
<li> However, it is difficult to apply and impossible to rub completely in.  </li>
<li> If you can get past the bad odor you have to accept that you look a whitish/blue color, frankly, you look dead.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s very thick</li>
<li> Since he switched to this product, he has not experienced any skin rash.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It stinks, literally. If you can get past the bad odor you have to accept that you look a whitish/blue color, frankly, you look dead. I wore this while I went on a walk one day and my god, I got the weirdest looks, I swear my neighbors thought a zombie apocalypse was happening.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because it indicates it is all natural and chemical free. The ingredients are natural, but it is not completely chemical free. I did some research of the ingredients and came across a web site that rates sunscreens and all the ingredients. They apply ratings to the safety of each. I would like to state that it did do the job in protecting my baby from being sunburned. I just wanted to advise others who are looking for a chemical free product like I was that this is not exactly the case.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful sunblock, especially for kids. It&#x27;s easy to apply and protects well, but is not too think, not greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a white coat on the skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> On our trip to Hawaii, we purchased five types of safe sunscreens considered safe by the Environmental Working Group ([...]), in order to do our own \\&quot;research\\&quot; on the effectiveness and ease of use for each product and settle on one for all our future trips. We did a comparitive analysis of the products, using each of them multiple times throughout our trip. (You may see these first two sentences when we review the other products. Sorry about that.)     Of the five products we tested, this was absolutely the most effective, even for one of our extremely sun-sensitive group members.  It was also the hardest to apply, however, and the adults in our group refused to use it on their faces as the week wore on.  The problem is how thick it is and the fact that it does not disappear even with repeated massaging of it into your skin. (I&#x27;ve read the reviews here that say otherwise, but we rubbed and rubbed and were still blue-white.)  For kids who don&#x27;t mind being a sort of bluish-white color, or those who will tolerate being rubbed quite a bit when you apply it, it will do a great job keeping them safe.  No one had a reaction to the ingredients, which was what we expected based on other reviews.  Finally, it didn&#x27;t even come off in the water, although you might want to re-apply after swimming just to be on the safe side.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because i wanted the most natural ingredients while being protecting item for my new baby.  This item is white colored and upon warming on the skin, a couple rubs, it will then disappear. I use it for my face and tips of ears as well and Very happy with what I got. the bottle is easy to hold to dispense the thick cream.  well done.</li>
    <li> I ordered item after reading some recent EPA warnings about sunblock products. Product did protect both my children from the sun, but my baby (9 months) seemed to have a bit of an allergic reaction to the product. My 3 year old tolerated product well, although it was difficult to spread product over the children. Both my kids had a \\&quot;blueish\\&quot; tint to them after using the product, but I have seen the same look with other products such as the new Johnson &amp; Johnson baby cream with SPF 50. I have opted to switch products mainly due to my baby&#x27;s break outs on this sunblock. However, it did do its job in regards to protecting both my kids from getting sunburned.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunblock.  I use it on my face very liberally and it is not greasy and does not cause any breakouts or chemical sensitivity reactions.  The white color can be rubbed in if you apply it in thin layers and rub each in completely before applying more.  Another solution is to use foundation underneath this.  (Since this is a physical sunscreen, I want it to be the top layer.) When I use in on our kids they have no complaints and they do not look strangely white as long as I take the time to rub it in (but they don&#x27;t care about looking strangely white anyway so it really doesn&#x27;t matter, right ?)</li>
    <li> My toddler has sensitive skin and reacts to most sunscreens (skin turns bright pink where sunscreen applied - ironically it looks like sunburn).  However, this is one of the only brands that does not cause a reaction.  This is a good mineral sunblock and worth the higher cost in my book.</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt for a chemical-free sunblock, as we use it on a daily basis living in the desert southwest. I read reviews that suggested this was among the best, but I am not impressed.  I&#x27;m sure it does the job successfully as a sunblock because the cream is so thick, that it&#x27;s impossible to blend it into your skin without leaving a white residue. I can&#x27;t imagine trying to use this on a child. Even if you don&#x27;t try and make the white cream disappear, the thick nature of the cream meant that it was actually uncomfortable for me to apply, pulling my skin as I tried to smear it on. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face due to the thickness. To top it off, I don&#x27;t care for the smell. It&#x27;s not scented, which is certainly what some people would want, but because of that, it smells just a little off. I will stick to chemical sunscreens for now. My sons hate having any white residue on their bodies at all (as do I!). I may keep this around for Halloween face paint.</li>
    <li> While I do prefer the older formula, this is still the best natural sunscreen I have found.  It is difficult to put on but it stays pretty well with water and rubbing and provides good protection.</li>
    <li> I use this on my preschooler and my infant/toddler regularly.  My preschooler spends 4 hours at day camp and her skin is protected with just one application in the morning.  It coats well and though it does not completely rub in at least you can see where you have covered! It does not seem to irritate my kids sensitive skin nearly as much as other sunscreens (even other mineral sunscreens) and the smell is not overwhelming.  I can even put it on their faces and their eyes don&#x27;t tear up as with other sunscreens.  My only real issue with this product is the high price.</li>
    <li> Not a lotion as it arrived here:  all the liquid had evaporated and what remained was unusable sludge.  Seemed to be a couple of years old.</li>
    <li> Had a horrible smell to it. I&#x27;ve used this lotion before and love it but this was obviously expired. Will not use this seller again.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I found that my son was allergic to most of the kids&#x27; sun blockers on the market. It turned out to be the perfect one. We later uncovered that my husband had the same allergy reaction to certain chemicals in most of the sunscreen/sun blockers too, even the ones for sensitive skin. We had always thought that he didn&#x27;t have enough protect and got sunburn. Since he switched to this product, he has not experienced any skin rash. You can also find this product at Babies R Us and Whole Foods Market. The price at Babies R Us is very competitive, esp. if you have coupons. We love it and always stock it up for summer.</li>
    <li> I love this product since it&#x27;s organic I use it on myself before I leave home and I&#x27;m out in the sun all day&lt;br /&gt;and I never get a sun burn it&#x27;s fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for my little one. Have used it on myself as well, due to my sensitive skin and worked great for me too. Only thing is the creme is a little thick.</li>
    <li> Natural is always better, thank you</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a chemical free sunscreen for my 12 month old daughter and as far as fulfilling that wish, the product succeeds.  However, it is difficult to apply and impossible to rub completely in.  I should have listened to the other reviews stating that it will leave your baby looking a bit blue.  My daughter looked like she belonged in a zombie movie even after many attempts and rubbing the lotion in. I am not in the process of trying out new brands but will use this one when I don&#x27;t plan on taking any pictures.      Unrelated to the product, and not reflected in my rating, I would warn buyers from ordering from Nutricity.  It took over a month for my sunscreen to arrive and that was with me sending multiple emails.  They kept giving me one excuse after another and would promise me that the sunscreen had been shipped, but then a week later something else would come up.  Again, this hassle with the shipper is not reflected in my rating, I just thought I would give others a heads up.</li>
    <li> Our girls have sensitive skin - this has worked well and we have not have any issues with burning (or even tanning!). We switched to Badger active though as the Earth&#x27;s best doesn&#x27;t absorb as well and stained some clothes.</li>
    <li> Too thick and too white!</li>
    <li> My product was old (almost expired).  I returned it and reordered, and received another just as old.  The lotion was very strange in texture- gritty and not like lotion at all.  I used it because I spent so much on it, but I was extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I like this sunblock, but my husband doesn&#x27;t!  It works well and is chemical free--which we love!  But the texture of it is very thick and my husband complains it is too hard to rub in completely.  Of course, he is a big fan of the newer aerosol-types that are so fast and easy :) I apply this one on my little girls (toddler/pre-school) because I don&#x27;t mind taking the time and I don&#x27;t want the chemicals on them!    Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product. It works!  It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel at all.</li>
    <li> My face is allergic to every other sunblock out on the market today, so this is a life-saver! My only complaint is that I do have to do a lot of rubbing to make it blend into my skin, but I think it&#x27;s comparable to all mineral-based sunblocks.</li>
    <li> Love this for my kids with skin allergies.</li>
    <li> This sunblock went on easy and did the job in the hot Texas sun. I will buy it again. It was thick enough so I felt my child was covered but it went on easily.</li>
    <li> We keep buying it because we feel it has the best coverage and is easy to apply. REALLY wish it came in larger bottles! It get&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself after researching toxic sunblocks for my son. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use a toxic one for myself:) it worked extremely well, but definitely left my arms and legs looking a little white-ish after applying and was a bit of a chore to put on because it is so thick.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but the bottle so so small for the price and it&#x27;s very thick so it doesn&#x27;t last long . I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Seems like it&#x27;s working great so far! :) Spreads well enough and seems to work. I will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> During the summer vacation, I used it very useful. It protects my skin and smells very good. I love this sunblock. Quick delivery is also good. Wowsome product.</li>
    <li> Great, because it&#x27;s mineral based. It works as well as ordinary sunscreen. My only issue with it was that it is sooo thick that it&#x27;s hard to rub into my child&#x27;s skin within feeling like I&#x27;m rubbing his skin off with it!  Also, it goes on a very bright white color that no amount of rubbing seems to make fade. So basically my son walks around the beach looking like a little white ghost!  Haha.  But in the end it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - protects him from the sun without putting lots of bad chemicals on his skin. So I&#x27;m happy with it :)</li>
