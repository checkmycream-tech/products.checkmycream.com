<li> If you do the treatment often it there seems to be less irritation, each time.</li>
<li> watch out I believe these destroy collagen leaving your face sunken and pores damaged</li>
<li> roller too small.</li>

    <li> Quick delivery!  I plan to buy more as gifts.</li>
    <li> roller too small. not wide enough. Needles not long enough.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but I now do it every 3 or 4 days.  It gives your skin a lovely glow.  Roll 10 times up and down, then 10 times across, then  diagonally in one direction 10 times, then the opposite diagonal 10 times. Be sure to sterilize the roller in alcohol 10 minutes before using and after using.  After rolling use a very good moisturizer on face and neck.  Check out Dawn&#x27;s video on you-tube.</li>
    <li> Thank u so much I had stretch marks for 3 yrs I tried emu oil tca peels laser rosehip oil morrocan oil nothing happened but this literally got rid of my marks thought it was a scam I still can&#x27;t believe there gone I lift my shirt up sometimes in disbelief lol it also got rid of those oil filled blkheads</li>
    <li> I am so glad to see the result. I have had stretch mark for half my life. After using the derma roller, I noticed the stretch mark was definitely change for better. I applied Vitamin C serum together. That would help a lot. It is awesome.</li>
    <li> I ordered.5mm. I been using this for two weeksthink its good I don&#x27;t feel any pain.&lt;br /&gt;You just need to roll it gently not make yourself bleed.&lt;br /&gt;I roll it on and under my eyes. I got hyperpigmentaion after a chemical peel, hoping that derma roller help me fade this. Before rolling I wipe all my makeup and wash my face with a cetaphil face wash. After that I put hydroceles serum and brightening masque by Eminence.&lt;br /&gt;I derma roll and sleep with the masque on. I soak my derma roll overnite in medical alcohol. I love this derma roller.</li>
    <li> Used it, Got a little red! Only more use will tell.</li>
    <li> has not reduced any scars but kind of feels good on your face</li>
    <li> I was scared to use this. I mean really, needles on your face? So, I did it gently, very gently ;) At first, my face was a little tingly and red. So afterwards, I put on my Main Line Vitamin C Serum and WOW. After 3 days, my acne scars and pores aren&#x27;t so noticeable. It&#x27;s going to be part of my skin care regimen. Also, I like to use the Derma Rolling Post facial mask after the needle roller.  I alternate between the two.  I am a happy camper!</li>
    <li> I like this derma roller. It is so helpful for my skin  .  My skin looks bright and more firm. Thank you</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do. It&#x27;s not painful. It leaves a bit of irritation immediately afterward. It feels to me like a mild sunburn. That fades quickly if you use a good face cream afterwards. If you do the treatment often it there seems to be less irritation, each time. The results are worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazing results ! After one use I saw i difference in my skin. My mom is going to buy one today ;)</li>
    <li> I received this product last week. The derma roller(0.5mm) was nicely packed and was delivered in time.&lt;br /&gt;The needles did look scary and I was nervous to use this on my face. I followed the sanitizing instructions and used it as I had seen on the you tube videos.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how painless it was. I actually had to press harder to feel the discomfort :D&lt;br /&gt;If you have used epilator ever(which I use on a regular basis, not in my face though) this thing won&#x27;t hurt at all compared to that! However it will sting a bit after you apply the moisturizer or serum. My face had bit of redness for almost 30 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have used it only once and plan to use on a weekly basis I&#x27;m yet to see the results. My skin did feel dry and little itchy (which I attribute to the dryness) so something did happen there :)&lt;br /&gt;I will update the review after a month of use.</li>
    <li> Love it. Only used the facial &amp; around the eyes so far &amp; not the body one. I had to wait &amp; get the topical anesthetic cream first as it was quite uncomfortable without it. Can say now I am beginning to see the changes in my face for the better.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it very long and have only used it once.  Its fun to do and doesn&#x27;t  hurt, just leaves the skin a little blushy red.  No overnight miracles - takes some time and patience.  I believe this roller will bring better results than a year&#x27;s worth of expensive skin creams.</li>
    <li> Seemed like it might have produced results eventually, but it squeaked so loudly when I used it that I couldn&#x27;t stand the noise so I returned it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to write a review considering I have only been using it for 3 days. My first impressions are 1) It does mildly hurt, feels like exactly what it is, tiny needles poking you and afterward feels and looks like you have a mild sunburn. 2) My skin does appear to be looking better already, very smooth and even skin tone. If you can stand the pain, I believe it is worth trying out!</li>
    <li> watch out I believe these destroy collagen leaving your face sunken and pores damaged</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I bought this. This item has saved my skin from YEARS of damage. I can&#x27;t say that it has done 100%, but I can say that I am comfortable enough to be around other people with no makeup on. I paired using this, with a Vitamin E oil to get rid of the scars. When using it over the acne (which has lessened by 90%), it feels a little uncomfortable, but nothing that anyone can handle, when you are done, it feels like a light sunburn. In the morning, my skin felt good as new! In some cases, it would take a few days for it to take affect, after some peeling and dry skin, I can&#x27;t help but touch my face and feel free from the burden of acne and scars alike! It&#x27;s really worth what I paid!</li>
