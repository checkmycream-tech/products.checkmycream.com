      <li>I have to tell you: I&#x27;ve met more women using this thing because they always ask me &#x27;what I&#x27;m wearing&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>but I am glad Amazon is selling</li>

      <li>tell them however I would pay more for this cologne as I do like the smell.&lt;br</li>

      <li>she &#x27;thinks it&#x27;s too strong&#x27;</li>
      <li>/&gt;Safari is for the wearer looking for a bit more substance and full range in his cologne.</li>
      <li>It is best recommended for men 35 and over but is especially enjoyable to those who have experimented with scents a bit and can fully appreciate its classical pretensions and full-bodied professional execution of Safari.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Projection is also fantastic, with 6+ hours the norm before it turns a bit toward a skin</li>

      <li>I have used this product for 15 years and confirmed this is the original product without any problems.</li>
      <li>Nothing like the original.</li>
      <li>It will bring a smile to your face!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>Somebody needs to fix either the original title or the one that shows up in the shopping cart.</li>
      <li>Smells different from authentic safari and cap has a brown sticker on top instead of wood looking top.</li>
      <li>On top of the cap was a brown sticker, when the real item has a cap with in-laid wood.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really cant do without it, I love it.</li>
      <li>I took it to the Ralph Lauren store near me, and purchased the same item, and it smells great, and the bottle looks far superior.</li>
      <li>but luckily you can still find on Amazon.2 hours</li>
      <li>but luckily you can still find on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so worthy</li>
      <li>This stuff has been the only cologne I&#x27;ve bought for many, many years.</li>
      <li>I have used Safari by Ralph Lauren for several years and have been very pleased.  </li>
      <li>but I have warned him he better find a new one because my sources for Safari for Men are disappearing rapidly.</li>
      <li>Safari&#x27;s greatness is achieved through its professionally first rate blending and the abilities of its notes to create a greater whole that emits an air of composure through its full-flavored yet fresh organic</li>
      <li>The sandalwood and cedar make this a really nice fragrance, especially on a man.</li>
      <li>The product I receive was worth the money</li>
      <li>The scent is strong, masculine and bold - not overpowering, cloying or intimidating.</li>
      <li>Wow this is one of the best smelling colognes I have smelt in a long time considering a woman is wearing it wow</li>
      <li>Not strong but a really pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>Have used Safari since I was 18 and this was the first time I ordered it online-</li>
      <li>Been using this for years and always a consistent product</li>
      <li>I was pleased to receive it in a very short time after I ordered it.</li>
      <li>Many years ago this was my standard Christmas gift request.  </li>
      <li>I ordered realm with this order, a 3.3 ounce bottle to be exact.  </li>
      <li>married now</li>
      <li>I suggest everyone to give it a try to know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
      <li>tried many different store unsuccessfully.</li>
      <li>Someone who can appreciate the past and is sophisticated enough to understand the great art of attempting to achieve timelessness while still remaining very much modern and vivid.</li>
      <li>The scent was not as strong and did not have the longevity of the actual cologne.</li>
      <li>They hung me out to dry, they took my money without a fair exchange and I have yet to be compensated for my actual purchase.</li>
      <li>It sets a very high bar.</li>
      <li>Much to my dismay</li>
      <li>It exudes a gentle confidence.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
      <li>Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ounces .I purchased this from Amazon much cheaper</li>
      <li>Whether real or imagined, it seems to be a real \\&quot;nookie\\&quot; getter.</li>
      <li>And the miniature size is very convnenient for travel.</li>
      <li>I do not hate the product, in fact quite the opposite I love it and was looking to replace my empty bottle.</li>
      <li>This is one cologne that you know is the real deal when you get it, but this is not it.  </li>
      <li>too much money for discontinued fragrance.</li>
      <li>Tried a few colognes before that, and I liked none.</li>
      <li>You will be surprised how many compliments you&#x27;ll get, especially if you&#x27;re going out with a date.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them and also this perfume.</li>
      <li>From the packaging bearing the classic crest to the actual juice inside, Safari is a tip of the hat to the more gentlemanly days of a citrus top over a classy balance of florals and a leather, vetiver and sandalwood dry down to keep things rather stately.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing rather groundbreaking nor daring about Safari.</li>
      <li>then anywhere else I looked,for the exact same product</li>
      <li>Safari offers these things and is highly recommendable for formal and professional occasions, but shouldn&#x27;t be rushed into.</li>
      <li>bergamot and lemon notes stand out early, mixing with eucalyptus</li>
      <li>So just avoid this product on Amazon, and buy it directly through Ralph Lauren.</li>
      <li>Has this mature, gentleman&#x27;s smell.</li>
      <li>That really surprised me.</li>
      <li>I ask for a new bottle on my birthday and occasionally for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I purchased this item to replace a bottle of the exact same type that was almost empty.  </li>

    <li> I have always loved Safari. Has this mature, gentleman&#x27;s smell. I love wearing it in the evening. The product I receive was worth the money and I would buy it again and again and again. It exudes a gentle confidence.</li>
    <li> Safari By Ralph Lauren For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ounces .I purchased this from Amazon much cheaper then anywhere else I looked,for the exact same product</li>
    <li> Wow this is one of the best smelling colognes I have smelt in a long time considering a woman is wearing it wow</li>
    <li> This has always been my husband&#x27;s \\&quot;signature scent,\\&quot; but I have warned him he better find a new one because my sources for Safari for Men are disappearing rapidly. Assuming you&#x27;re reading this review because you&#x27;re thinking of buying it, and assuming Amazon has it in stock, I&#x27;d recommend you go for it...you may not get another chance.</li>
    <li> This cologne is a classic one is very hard to find .I tried many different store unsuccessfully. I was very happy to find it on Amazon for reasonable price.. I bought it  for my husband as a gift  and he loved it . I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase it was a suscess</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so worthy cuz it&#x27;s such a hard to get perfume.... i love it !</li>
    <li> Safari has been my favorite cologne since 1997. Tried a few colognes before that, and I liked none. Safari is the only cologne I&#x27;ve been using in the last fourteen years. it&#x27;s simply amazing. I always get a lot of compliments from girls when I wear it, and they tell me that I smell great. I used to buy it from Macy&#x27;s until 2007, then all of a sudden they stopped selling it. That really surprised me. So, I went to Amazon&#x27;s website, and was very pleased to find it. You&#x27;ve got a customer for life because again, it&#x27;s the only cologne I wear and the only cologne I will continue to buy from you. I suggest everyone to give it a try to know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about. You will be surprised how many compliments you&#x27;ll get, especially if you&#x27;re going out with a date. Thank you Amazon for having this product. I was pleased to receive it in a very short time after I ordered it. You can never go wrong when you shop in Amazon.com</li>
    <li> From Mr. and Mrs. Claus - THANK YOU! Mr. Claus will not wear any other cologne!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years. I guess Ralph Lauren have discontinued it, as it can&#x27;t be found at Macy&#x27;s (which used to carry it all the time) and other department-stores anymore. But it can still be found on-line, at least for now. The sandalwood and cedar make this a really nice fragrance, especially on a man. And the miniature size is very convnenient for travel. A pity if it has indeed been discontinued... :-(</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over 10 years. I love it.</li>
    <li> Not easy to find in stores... best bet is through Amazon.  Delicious scent for the man in your life!  It will bring a smile to your face!</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best, I have used this product for years and get great response from not only my friends and co-worker but also my girls&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Safari for Men is a great cologne.  Not strong but a really pleasant scent.  My husband is always complimented  on his cologne. I think he has used Safari for 20 years!</li>
    <li> The safari cologne I received was definitely fake. Smells different from authentic safari and cap has a brown sticker on top instead of wood looking top. I was fully refunded.</li>
    <li> I do not hate the product, in fact quite the opposite I love it and was looking to replace my empty bottle. However, the one that I received from Amazon was either an extremely old shelf product, or possibly a fake, because it smelled like turpentine and the bottle as well as the box looked off. It was missing the &#x27;Ralph Lauren&#x27; label on the front of the bottle as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Amazon refunded my purchase and told me to simply dispose of the product. I took it to the Ralph Lauren store near me, and purchased the same item, and it smells great, and the bottle looks far superior. I showed the woman at the counter the Amazon one, and she evaluated it and smelled it and said that my specimen was definitely not their product... She even said that it smelled like rubbing alcohol as opposed to cologne. So just avoid this product on Amazon, and buy it directly through Ralph Lauren.</li>
    <li> This is not Safari as advertised by department stores!  Went to site immediate to return but does not show as a purchase.  Do not recommed byuying from seller.  I am greatly disappointed!  This is one cologne that you know is the real deal when you get it, but this is not it.  Received item June 24, 2014 and attempting to return as of now, June 24, 2014.</li>
    <li> Safari is my best and it give me respect and pleasure among my friends.  I really cant do without it, I love it.</li>
    <li> My husband smells delicious</li>
    <li> Great item for men. I enjoy this product and it is a good value. I get compliments from lots of people when I wear  Safari !</li>
    <li> The smell does not last like the regular safari and the unfortunate thing is dat i can&#x27;t throw it away. I advise that you should not buy.</li>
    <li> great product at reasonable price</li>
    <li> Great cologne at a great price. Fast shipping as well. I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for an expensive cologne at an inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> This is one scent that I have used for years and it is getting hard to find so have to buy it online.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this mens cologne.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years along with Realm as well.  I ordered realm with this order, a 3.3 ounce bottle to be exact.  I didn&#x27;t receive a 3.3 oz. bottle of realm.  I received a bottle less than half that size.  Although the records prove I did order the 3.3 oz bottle or realm, Amazon has done nothing to compensate me.  It&#x27;s frustrating getting kicked around as a consumer but I do thank Amazon for asking me to rate the one Item that I ordered; the one that I didn&#x27;t write them letters about which is the Safari Mens cologne.  I don&#x27;t order anything from Amazon any more.  They hung me out to dry, they took my money without a fair exchange and I have yet to be compensated for my actual purchase.</li>
    <li> in the evenings, when I want to head out on the town with the guys, and smell like a jungle rat..uh, I mean cat....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Rocky</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I have loved this fragrance ever since the first time I got it for my then-bf; now-husband.&lt;br /&gt;Fell in love with both the scent and the man lol. It is everything a man should smell like. The scent is strong, masculine and bold - not overpowering, cloying or intimidating. The notes are deep and woodsy. Reminds me of a hunter, a seafarer or a confident thinker. For me, it is the holy grail of men&#x27;s fragrances. It sets a very high bar. If I am a man, I would wear this to work, to dates, and yes, even to my wedding. I couldn&#x27;t find this anymore in Macy&#x27;s where I bought it from but I am glad Amazon is selling it.&lt;br /&gt;My husband agrees this is the one and only fragrance for him too. His all-time favorite. Whether you are buying this for yourself or a gift for someone, you cannot go wrong with Polo Safari.</li>
    <li> Ladies love the smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne since 1992 when I joined the military and during college days.  I have to tell you: I&#x27;ve met more women using this thing because they always ask me &#x27;what I&#x27;m wearing&#x27;.  And it drives them even crazier when they drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m married now and my wife loves it too, but she &#x27;thinks it&#x27;s too strong&#x27; (I call BS because she gets jealous every time I wear it to work, knowing there are a lot of other women there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get this cologne..you wonder why it&#x27;s a little pricey.  It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I have used Safari by Ralph Lauren for several years and have been very pleased.  I have had numerous compliments while wearing it.  Whether real or imagined, it seems to be a real \\&quot;nookie\\&quot; getter.</li>
    <li> After adding to shopping cart, Perfumania&#x27;s 4.2 oz bottle reads &amp;#34;.......Not Spray&amp;#34;.  Somebody needs to fix either the original title or the one that shows up in the shopping cart.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to replace a bottle of the exact same type that was almost empty.  Much to my dismay in comparing the two bottles, this product has virtually no fragrance and what fragrance you can make out is kind of an oily soapy smell.  It smells awful.  Nothing like the original. Since it is considered a hazardous material, I cannot return it!  A complete waste of $52!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned: do not buy an expensive cologne online because you have no idea what you will get and you cannot return it!</li>
    <li> Have used Safari since I was 18 and this was the first time I ordered it online- I always get it from Macys. What I got I can&#x27;t smell even when I&#x27;m putting it on. This is either very old or fake.</li>
    <li> too much money for discontinued fragrance. Realize that it is eau de toilette and not cologne. Not the smell I remembered but what do you expect</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 15 years and confirmed this is the original product without any problems. I will order again</li>
    <li> Many years ago this was my standard Christmas gift request.  When family members stopped buying it I thought it might have gone off the market.  Recently I wanted to go back to this scent and began looking.  When I saw the prices I knew why they stopped.  It is fairly expensive now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give it a try again anyway and am sold on this and will be ordering as I need more.</li>
    <li> Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Safari represents the apex of achievement in fragrance under the Ralph Lauren name. From the packaging bearing the classic crest to the actual juice inside, Safari is a tip of the hat to the more gentlemanly days of a citrus top over a classy balance of florals and a leather, vetiver and sandalwood dry down to keep things rather stately.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing rather groundbreaking nor daring about Safari. Safari&#x27;s greatness is achieved through its professionally first rate blending and the abilities of its notes to create a greater whole that emits an air of composure through its full-flavored yet fresh organic conception.&lt;br /&gt;The bergamot and lemon notes stand out early, mixing with eucalyptus and/or a synthetic mint/green note that gives Safari a rather herbal citric feel. The middle notes are mostly common spice garden varieties with a touch of floral, with the basil, geranium, thyme and especially the cinnamon blending well with the top to create a rather classic and well-worn familiarity accentuated by the slightest touch of feminine floral to give Safari a higher range than usual for its time.&lt;br /&gt;The dry down is a standard Polo trademark, the cedarwood, oak moss, patchouli, sandalwood, leather and vetiver allow for the floral and herbal middle notes to stretch out and live deep into the dry down.&lt;br /&gt;Safari is for the wearer looking for a bit more substance and full range in his cologne. Someone who can appreciate the past and is sophisticated enough to understand the great art of attempting to achieve timelessness while still remaining very much modern and vivid. Safari offers these things and is highly recommendable for formal and professional occasions, but shouldn&#x27;t be rushed into. It is best recommended for men 35 and over but is especially enjoyable to those who have experimented with scents a bit and can fully appreciate its classical pretensions and full-bodied professional execution of Safari.&lt;br /&gt;Longevity is outstanding, with 8-12 hours the norm and 14 not inconceivable on some. Projection is also fantastic, with 6+ hours the norm before it turns a bit toward a skin scent.&lt;br /&gt;A showpiece in any collection that is a bit harder to find than the other Polo releases, but luckily you can still find on Amazon.2 hours the norm and 14 not inconceivable on some.

    <li> Best stuff on the market . . . recommend to any guy looking to be complemented by his girlfriend or wife. Just incredibly manly . . .</li>
    <li> This stuff has been the only cologne I&#x27;ve bought for many, many years. I would recommend it, and hope that it never goes off the market.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and always a consistent product</li>
    <li> I have had this cologne in the past, in which I purchased at a department store. The item I purchased Amazon.com and was Prime eligible. This item is a counterfeit and knockoff. The scent was not as strong and did not have the longevity of the actual cologne. The emblem on the front of the bottle was plastic and did not have the Ralph Lauren logo embedded. On top of the cap was a brown sticker, when the real item has a cap with in-laid wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price wasn&#x27;t even discounted to represent a &amp;#34;Ralf Loren&amp;#34; knockoff cologne. I am extremely disappointed and I will be returning this item!</li>
    <li> I sent this item as a gift for my brothers birthday. I asked them to gift wrap it and they did awesome. I highly recommend them and also this perfume. It is great.</li>
    <li> Really good product, this is the first RL Cologne I have own and is one of my favorites, I love it.</li>
    <li> *Christine&#x27;s husband here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran across Safari for men over a decade ago.  I often get complinents (from women) on the cologne smell.  I ask for a new bottle on my birthday and occasionally for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t tell them however I would pay more for this cologne as I do like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is sturdy and the sprayer works well.  Have never had a problem with it not spraying.</li>
