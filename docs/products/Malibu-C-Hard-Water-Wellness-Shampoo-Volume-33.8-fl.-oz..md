      <li>Such an awesome shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love the way that the shampoo cleans my hair without stripping the natral oils.</li>

      <li>My hair is very soft and looks in great condition since I incorporated this shampoo into my routine.</li>
      <li>Its ok, but not for my hair, my hair in baby fine</li>
      <li>I also like the very mild scent -- not overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>I have bleached blond highlights and fine hair.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time last night and was so impressed!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any shampoo that I was less impressed with.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After just one use, I already saw a huge improvement.</li>
      <li>I really think this shampoo works amazingly well.</li>
      <li>The shampoo dries out my hair a bit, so I have to use the Malibu conditioner as well as a light, spray, leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>it keeps my hair soft and in good condition.</li>
      <li>great smell love how clean and fresh it is , definitely will be purchasing after done with this bottle !  </li>
      <li>My hair is a light honey brown, straight and very fine.</li>
      <li>daily clarifying shampoos seem ineffective, but thuis malibu product is amazing!</li>
      <li>but the results are worth it!</li>
      <li>My hair always looks perfect and no more yucky build up.</li>
      <li>It made such a difference that I bought this Malibu shampoo and the conditioner and the difference has been remarkable.</li>
      <li>My husband has to keep his head shaved for work, but it helps significantly with his dandruff.</li>
      <li>I was willing to pay more for it, until now.  </li>
      <li>AND FEELS REALLY CLEAN.</li>
      <li>My impressions of this shampoo: bottle is attractive enough, the pump dispenses the right amount.</li>
      <li>Excellent product if you have hard water.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a mighty struggle to keep it looking fresh over time.</li>
      <li>But I didn&#x27;t realize how good I had it until I used what was left of my Pureology shampoo yesterday.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find any stores in my area that sell it, but Amazon delivers it quickly.</li>
      <li>Works great on my dark, color-treated hair.  </li>
      <li>Malibu 2000 has done a great job of keeping down the mineral build up and keeping up my hair color.</li>
      <li>this shampoo is the best for hard water hair issues i have ever tried!</li>
      <li>II love this large size because my whole family can use it.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is incredible for preventing hard water buildup.</li>
      <li>it suds up and softens in hard water real nice.</li>
      <li>Our water contains large amounts of iron and calcium, and this shampoo keeps hair soft, smooth, and healthy.</li>
      <li>This keeps it soft and healthy, and most importantly, NOT green.</li>
      <li>I like the fresh fragrance and with the conditioner</li>
      <li>In my opinion, though, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Also used Pureology&#x27;s Purify and thought it was pretty effective, but the bottle was small and kind of spendy, so I started window shopping and found Malibu C</li>
      <li>Able to use it on her 8 and 9 year old daughter&#x27;s hair without problems .</li>
      <li>This shampoo is nice, although I haven&#x27;t noticed it if is actually taking any iron out of my hair yet or not.</li>
      <li>It became brittle and would snap off very, very close to the root.</li>
      <li>It has always been a great product, at times hard to find, and a bit costly.</li>
      <li>Works great in hard water with a lot of iron.</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>Moral of this review: Do Not Buy Malibu products from Love Our Lines</li>
      <li>Much cheaper!    </li>
      <li>, I condition my hair FIRST and then rinse it out like 75% of the way.</li>
      <li>but I will only be able to tell after about 10-14 days of shampooing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this shampoo is the best for hard water hair issues i have ever tried! my hair is fine, and any chemicals or minerals that attach to it weigh it down, and remove the shine. daily clarifying shampoos seem ineffective, but thuis malibu product is amazing! doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp, leaves my hair soft and shiny. highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product, in conjunction with using the Malibu C Hard Water Weekly Demineralizer on a weekly basis, has been the answer to my hair problem prayers. I get my hair highlighted blonde, and after moving into a new home with well water, it started turning orange. I did in salon treatments, we got a new water softener, we have a whole home iron filter, and we even installed iron filtering shower heads. Nothing worked and my hair continued to turn brassy due to the iron in our water. I started using these two products and my hair is still blonde 5 weeks after my last highlight. This is the only things that has worked for me, and will save me hundreds of dollars because I no longer have to return to the salon every four weeks for a salon treatment and new highlights.</li>
    <li> My hair was such a wreck - we have a well.  My hair dresser kept cutting the damaged ends and my hair got shorter and shoter (not what I want.)  This truly saved my hair.  When I went for my last cut my stylist couldn&#x27;t believe the change.  I miss the lather of my old stuff but my  hair thanks me.</li>
    <li> Sulfate-free shampoos are all the hype, and with this new house and ridiculously hard water, I couldn&#x27;t have found a better shampoo.  Less tangles.  Less damage.  Less ORANGE.  I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this from the same company again.  The shipping is just outrageous, honestly.</li>
    <li> This product does work as long as you continuously use it.  I wish they had conditioner, too, though.</li>
    <li> I have well water and started using a salt specifically to remove iron from my water. My hair became very coarse and never felt soft. After a few shampoos with Malibu C my hair began to soften and was shiny again. I would recommend it to anyone that has well water.</li>
    <li> Bought this product because I have well water and my hair was going to the dogs.  I know it sometimes depends on what kind of well water you have (each can have different minerals and different levels of excess), so it might be more prudent to spend the money on a water test instead.  But this product did nothing for me and I am looking to give it away.    What ended up working for me is using simple baking soda to clean hair once a week followed by an apple cider vinegar rinse (sometimes with a teaspoon of honey added).  Much cheaper!    I do like the Malibu Packet treatments though.  Use those about once a month.</li>
    <li> I spend hundreds of dollars getting my hair colored and was always disappointed with the brassy red that showed up a few weeks after the color application because of all of the iron in my well water.  Then, a hair dresser told me about this shampoo.  Since I started using it, I no longer have issues with my hair turning red. The shampoo dries out my hair a bit, so I have to use the Malibu conditioner as well as a light, spray, leave-in conditioner. This shampoo has saved my color treated hair and with the addition of the leave-in conditioner, my hair has never been healthier. I can&#x27;t find any stores in my area that sell it, but Amazon delivers it quickly.</li>
    <li> We moved to an area with well water and I had no idea that well water affects hair condition so much. I told my hair stylist that my color had not held up well and that I practically had red hair. She guessed that I was washing my hair in well water and as a part of the color treatment applied Malibu product. It made such a difference that I bought this Malibu shampoo and the conditioner and the difference has been remarkable. After only one week of use, my hair is back to normal color and is soft, silky and less frizzy than after using my regular product, Garnier. I highly recommend this for customers with well water.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it works better than anything else I have tried. I have well water so there are alot of minerals that build up in my hair and make it dull.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!!!  Anyone who has hard or even semi-hard water don&#x27;t hesitate buying!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has changed my hair.  I have a well and my water is super hard and has made my hair dull and brittle.  Since using this shampoo I have had people commenting on my hair and how good it looks.  It has literally been years since I felt like my hair looked good so this has been a huge improvement for me!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. KEEPS THE REDISH COLOR OUT OF YOUR HAIR PLUS HAIR IS SOFT AND FEELS REALLY CLEAN. I&#x27;ve BEEN USING THIS SHAMPOO FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Delivery also was great</li>
    <li> This was very harsh on my hair. I gave it to my spouse.</li>
    <li> I too recently purchashed a home in a rural area with a well. My hair was turning orange, breaking off (looked like a shedding mutt),I hated going out in public and hearing jokes about my Bozo hair. I tried coloring my hair and it would not take the color. I was using an extreme amount of hair spray trying to style my hair. My hair laid flat and was glowing in the dark orange.It was to the point of being ridiculous. I started reading online things to try to get the orange to fade. Nothing worked. I finally came across Malibu products. I thought why not, I&#x27;ve tried everything else. It\\&quot;s like a miracle! My hair is now a normal color. It bounces and shines.I can style it and it last all day at work without a bunch of hairspray. It&#x27;s not breaking off. I threw out all of my other shampoos and conditioners. I will never again use another product. LOVE IT! I swear by it. It&#x27;s a miracle. The bottle says it can be used as a body wash also. I thought I&#x27;ld give it a try. Another miracle. No more itchy skin. I also threw out all of my other body washes. A MIRACLE. Thank you Malibu.</li>
    <li> I have always been frustrated with my thick, coarse hair, and especially when I got done at the salon.  My stylist always made it so shiny, soft, and straight, and no matter what product and technique I used, I just couldn&#x27;t get it to do the same.  It finally dawned on me that my hard water was to blame.  I quickly did a search on \\&quot;hard water shampoo\\&quot; and arrived at Malibu.  I used it for the first time last night and was so impressed!  My normally unmanageable mess is now silky, soft, and shiny.  It smells great and does wonders to my hair.  I HIGHLY recommend this product, although it is a bit pricy.  In my opinion, though, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have EXTREEMLY hard water in my town home.  The water is so hard to the point that many times when I run the shower, all I smell is chlorine.  I feel like I&#x27;m taking a shower in a pool.  It&#x27;s has cause a whole host of issues that I never knew could exist.  One of those issues has been with my hair.  After going to a hair salon the hair stylist mentioned that I should purchase this product because of my hard water.  After the first time I used it, I noticed that my hair was much lighter and looked healthier.  II love this large size because my whole family can use it.  It has a easy to use pump on the top and last a long time.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> We have hard well-water and my haircolor was turning brassy, so I decided to try the Malibu 2000 Well Water Action shampoo based on the positive reviews.  It made my hair very dry, coarse, and tangled.  I couldn&#x27;t comb through it.  I&#x27;ve never tried any shampoo that I was less impressed with.  I might as well have flushed that money down the toilet.</li>
    <li> We have very hard well water which leaves a mineral buildup slowly but surely on hair, especially affecting colored hair and the texture and softness of all hair.  Since using this shampoo I have noticed that my hair color stays true and last longer and my hair is much softer and healthier (less breakage).  The way I use it is as a &amp;#34;pre-treatment&amp;#34;: I apply the shampoo, leave it in for a minute or two, rinse and then proceed with my specialty shampoo &amp; conditioner for color treated hair.  Others in my household just use this shampoo and the Malibu C conditioner with good results. Rinsing with cold water is beneficial, but I don&#x27;t always do that, brrrr!!!</li>
    <li> Despite a full system water softener system, our water is still brutally hard.  This product really works! It leaves hair feeling clean and soft and lusterous looking. Will definitely re order.  The scent is clean and light, very nice.</li>
    <li> Works great in hard water with a lot of iron.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is fantastic!!!IF YOU HAVE WELL WATER AND HIGHLIGHTED HAIR IT WILL KEEP IT FROM TURNING ORANGE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen absolutely Incredible results from the use of the Malibu C hard water wellness shampoo and conditioner (and also the occasional weekly treatment). I live in Germany, where the water is VERY hard and it was destroying my hair. It became brittle and would snap off very, very close to the root. I also had a horrifying amount of build-up on my scalp that looked like dandruff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use, I already saw a huge improvement. After 2-3 uses, the build-up was gone. Now, with continued use, I see that my hair is becoming healthy again. What a relief!</li>
    <li> My hair was looking sooo bad. Im a city girl &amp; last year i decided to move to the country, &amp; i was really starting to regret it. My hair looked dirty all the time . Even with our water softener. I kept my hair up in pony tail for fear someone would notice &amp; think i never bathed. So idecided to stop feeling sorry for myself. I looked online &amp; found malibu, oh my gosh, it feally works! I love it! I will b using this product from now on.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great at removing buildup on my hair. We have well water that tends to leave my hair hair feeling thick and caked after a while. I use this shampoo a couple times a month and started also using oil (Moroccan Oil and Kukui Nut oil) on my hair after washing with this and my other shampoos. My hair is soft and manageable like never before!</li>
    <li> Its ok, but not for my hair, my hair in baby fine and it does not work with my well water. I will not get again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Malibu&#x27;s Hard Water Shampoo (+ Conditioner, Treatment Crystals) for more than a year, and actually LOVE the products. They work very well. HOWEVER, when I ordered the big bottle of shampoo from &amp;#34;Love Our Lines Beauty&amp;#34; - it was Horrendous. The shampoo came out of the bottle yellow, instead of clear. And it barely lathered. It left my hair flat. Moral of this review: Do Not Buy Malibu products from Love Our Lines Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;You can see in the attached photo that the bottle looked green, instead of blue - because of the yellow shampoo color. There&#x27;s also a pic of the shampoo when I poured it out onto a white plate. It Really is normally clear (when I get it from other sellers).</li>
    <li> We have horrible well water that turns my blonde hair Kermit-The-Frog-Green. This is the ONLY shampoo I can use to stop my hair from becoming a big green mess. The shampoo IS drying though (having hard water definitely doesn&#x27;t help) so what I do is, I condition my hair FIRST and then rinse it out like 75% of the way. Then I shampoo and follow with a really hydrating conditioner (I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect one). This keeps it soft and healthy, and most importantly, NOT green. Even my hair stylist was blown away at the improvement of my hair and now recommends it to her other green-haired clients! It&#x27;s not super effective for getting rid of the green that&#x27;s already in your hair (for that, I used to have to go the salon and get a de-green-ing treatment) but there is nothing better for keeping the green away.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended that I try the Malibu products. Can&#x27;t live without this in our area. Does a tremendously good job of keeping mineral buildup, specifically iron deposits, from our well water in check. I use it in combination with the weekly treatment packages. My hair is a light honey brown, straight and very fine. The Malibu product line has eliminated the brassy tones, especially in the the crown area, and restored the shine, natural highlights  and volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> Shampoo was every thing l could have hoped for!!!</li>
    <li> I have well water running through old lead pipes, and this product does a great job removing a lot of the minerals that cling to my hair, and turn it a lovely shade of orange!</li>
    <li> A must for people with hard water.&lt;br /&gt;The only shampoo that works with our well water.&lt;br /&gt;Bought the conditioner, too.</li>
    <li> Our well water is full of minerals and my hair looks &amp; feels dull if I don&#x27;t use a shampoo that clarifies it.  I&#x27;ve used Ion and it was ok, but I didn&#x27;t like how watery it was.  Also used Pureology&#x27;s Purify and thought it was pretty effective, but the bottle was small and kind of spendy, so I started window shopping and found Malibu C a while back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell and feel of this shampoo, and it keeps my color treated hair looking vibrant.  But I didn&#x27;t realize how good I had it until I used what was left of my Pureology shampoo yesterday.  Yikes.  It gave my hair that feeling you get from a harsh shampoo that strips it.  Couldn&#x27;t get my fingers all the way through it during the rinse.  So now I&#x27;ll stick with Malibu unless something more magical comes along.  Works well, feels good, price is right.</li>
    <li> WASTE OF MONEY!!!! Product does NOT do what it advertises, and after 2 and a half weeks of use- my hair is so dry and brittle; the bottom half of hair actually feels &amp;#34;Crunchy&amp;#34; like twine...and the ends are actually breaking off. It  did NOTHING to remove brassiness in my blonde hair due to hard water. I spent $40 on both the Malibu C hard water wellness shampoo, conditioner, and 4- once a week hard water remedy packets. (I&#x27;ve only used 2...but have gotten zero results, and am stopping all products together to stop further damaging my hair!)  Oh yeah--and the so called &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; is a joke! It  Does NOT condition AT ALL.  I am SO disappointed in this product, and can&#x27;t believe all of the positive reviews it got...makes me think it must be people in the industry that post these reviews.  Even if this stuff was on sale for $1.00, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it--it&#x27;s that Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Note: I did Not buy this product from Amazon- I bought it directly from the Malibu Wellness Company---but am so angry that I wasted my money, that I wanted to alert amazon users as well---as I see this site also gave mostly positive reviews also!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful for colored hair.  I have well water and it contains iron.  This shampoo takes the brassy look out.</li>
    <li> I live on a country property with lots of iron and other minerals in the water -- very hard on hair, especially lightened hair like mine. Malibu 2000 has done a great job of keeping down the mineral build up and keeping up my hair color. I like the fresh fragrance and with the conditioner it keeps my hair soft and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I have gray hair and well water my colorist recommended this shampoo and I love it.  I also use the packets which with the help of malibu I have been able to remove all the orange from my gray.  My hair looks amazing with this shampoo, it is healthier than it has ever been.  Thanks Malibu.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is incredible for preventing hard water buildup. Our water contains large amounts of iron and calcium, and this shampoo keeps hair soft, smooth, and healthy. It is gentle enough to use daily on fine hair, yet still thoroughly cleans. I dye my hair red with henna and cassia, so I do not know if it prevents all brassiness. I do know that henna and cassia can have adverse effects to mineral buildup, and this shampoo has helped prevent any ill effects/distortion of dye.</li>
    <li> it works.  it suds up and softens in hard water real nice. so to sum this up id buy it again.:0</li>
    <li> We have terrible well water even with a water softener.  I color my hair and this keeps it from turning orange.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tad drying, but the conditioner undoes that! Buy that too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will revive your hair color even if you didn&#x27;t think anything was wrong in the first place! My toddler has dark, sandy blonde hair and it brings back the gold that was getting dull. My infant has medium brown hair and it does the same thing with her whisps of gold highlights. My husband has to keep his head shaved for work, but it helps significantly with his dandruff. It makes my hair fluffy, and my color-treated chocolate brown less coppery. And we all love the creamsicle scent!</li>
    <li> Great for well water hair</li>
    <li> Gives a lot of lather even in my very hard water.  My hair is soft and shiny afterwards.  I also like the very mild scent -- not overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> My well water is slightly on the hard side, not quite bad enough to warrent a water softener but my fine hair does get a build up over a short period of time. Malibu works great to bond with the water and rinse out of my hair. I have been using it for about a year and have never had a build up.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get all the gold/red/brown color off my white, but I see no more build up and I like the way it makes my hair feel. I have horrible well water in that it is off the chart in iron. We have a filter on the whole house and it still deposits on my hair.</li>
    <li> It is good shampoo. Still not sure if this is what I need with us having well water that has lots of iron in it.</li>
    <li> works great for blondes with chlorine</li>
    <li> I have artificially high-lighted blonde hair and hard water in New England. It&#x27;s a mighty struggle to keep it looking fresh over time. I already use both Malibu demineralizer and blonde wellness packets. I bought this shampoo to up the ante against residues and minerals that dull my hair and make it very unmanageable. My impressions of this shampoo: bottle is attractive enough, the pump dispenses the right amount. It smells like orange candy and there aren&#x27;t many suds. Sulfates make soap suds and this doesn&#x27;t have any. The benefits are it definitely cleans your hair well and it is a great maintenance product to use between demineralizer packets for keeping my hair looking good. It&#x27;s more work but the results are worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really done anything about the hard water build up. My hair looks ok I guess, but still tangling badly even with conditioner. It smells good, so that&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> Excellent product if you have hard water. My hair feels softer and feels like I washed it in regular water! I received the package exactly as promised and was a great price.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is nice, although I haven&#x27;t noticed it if is actually taking any iron out of my hair yet or not. maybe it is too soon to tell but it smells amazing like oranges or something.</li>
    <li> I needed something to get the \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; out from hard water.  This didn&#x27;t do it.  One of your reviews mentioned \\&quot;Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit.  and THAT DID WORK.  Nix on spending the money for this shampoo.  Use the grapefruit instead.</li>
    <li> I have bleached blond highlights and fine hair. I have lived in a house with well water for 8 yrs. Hair health is very important to me. I really love this shampoo and the Wellness hard water crystal packets as well. I really think this shampoo works amazingly well. I have used Wen cleansing conditioner as a shampoo and conditioner for years and my hair was still frizzy and unmanageable, and I blame that on our well water because when I travel, the Wen system works great. Having said all that, my routine now is to use this Malibu shampoo every time I cleanse, follow with Wen as my conditioner, and use the Wellness crystal packet once a week.  My hair is very soft and looks in great condition since I incorporated this shampoo into my routine. Don&#x27;t underestimate how badly water can damage your hair, even though we have a water softener and filter on our showerhead, it doesn&#x27;t matter!</li>
    <li> I really like it  - I work 5-6 hours a day at a time, and then smell like the pool for the rest of the day.  This really helps eliminate it and I use it as a body wash too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all. It didn&#x27;t lather well, didn&#x27;t smell good, was very hard to rinse out and left my hair dull, limp and darker looking. Most of all it did NOT do what it was supposed to do. So save your money and don&#x27;t buy this stuff - and I wish I could get my money back for the 2/3 of the bottle I couldn&#x27;t even give away, so had to pitch it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Malibu Shampoo for the last 14 years.  It has always been a great product, at times hard to find, and a bit costly. I was willing to pay more for it, until now.  This last purchase turned out to be a new \\&quot;vegan\\&quot; variety..  I am not sure what is different about it, and perhaps I don&#x27;t really want to know,  but I will be very watchful of this in the future, as I will not buy this type again.  It does not clean as well as the old product, nor does it have the pleasant fragrance.  I am not into heavy perfume smells, but the old one was very nice.  As far as the seller, shipping was fast, I just don&#x27;t care for the new type.</li>
    <li> Works well, but find leaves my hair with a lot if tangles, even with he conditioner it is difficult to brush.  It des do the job though.  Use it 2-3 times a week</li>
    <li> I first used this shampoo while staying at West Baden Springs Hotel. I leave your hair shiny and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> my hairdresser said it&#x27;s working. she couldn&#x27;t smell the rust build up during this visit. it leaves my hair managable but you need to use a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product and great transaction. Love the way that the shampoo cleans my hair without stripping the natral oils. My water now feels like I am washing with pure water.</li>
    <li> This product just doesn&#x27;t have enough of whatever is needed to clean my scalp. I&#x27;ve tried it many times and won&#x27;t be using it anymore. Sorry.</li>
    <li> great smell love how clean and fresh it is , definitely will be purchasing after done with this bottle !  Also i didnt find it to be very dry on my highlighted hair .</li>
    <li> Excelente producto , muy buen producto para la caspa.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome shampoo. Best shampoo I ever bought! My hair always looks perfect and no more yucky build up.</li>
    <li> Not the best for my hair type.</li>
    <li> My daughter said a beautician had used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and she was amazed at the difference she was able to see.  Her dull and brittle looking hair from the minerals in well water was restored to its natural lustre. Able to use it on her 8 and 9 year old daughter&#x27;s hair without problems .</li>
    <li> So far I think this is actually working on keeping my bleached hair blonde and preventing the minerals in our water softened (hard) well water.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this shampoo we had hard water and my normal shampoo wouldn&#x27;t even lather and I just felt as if my hair was dirty and grimy. When I tried this I really liked and used it for a few years. My hair is thin although I have a lot of it. We now have city water so I don&#x27;t need to use it. The price was decent and it smelled amazing!! Would certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> the shampoo lathers very well and leaves hair soft, the only problem is that it leaves build-up in the hair 4/5 stars</li>
    <li> I have light brown hair beginning to go white in an odd pattern of many isolated hairs and also 2 dense patches. These white hairs are bright white at the root, but were turning green blue along the shaft. My stylist and Sally&#x27;s tried several unsuccessful things, including Ion shampoo. Since I keep my hair permed, coloring was not an option. Malibu was ordered for me by the salon. The green blue color is gone. Now all the white hairs have white roots and blonde shafts. I wish the white was back but I like the color which is similar to being frosted. Soft hair is a bonus. I like the nice fruity smell of the shampoo and I don&#x27;t find it lingers once my hair is dry. I use the shampoo every day and no conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried the Malibu conditioner. I have used the weekly scalp treatment twice, finding it made my white patches a glaring orange bronze, so I cannot recommend them for white hair.</li>
    <li> This really made a difference in the texture of my hair--softer and shinier. I use it first, BEFORE using my regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  I have well water now and have had major problems with my hair because of the well water.  Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo makes my hair more manageable.  Only shampoo I have used for past 3 years.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says.....gets all the products out of your hair. Use it once a week and your hair will shine. My bottle has lasted me 2 years.</li>
    <li> We have hard water even after going through a filter and this product works! I,also use the cream rinse and packets.</li>
    <li> I do like the Malibu line but really wanted the scalp wellness shampoo.  This was a little cheaper so I thought I would give it a try.  It leaves my hair really soft and clean.  I would probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have bought the product from the store before and loved it.  When I got this product it seemed like it might have been opened and was leaking.  I cannot tell YET if the quality of the product was compromised.  The smell seems slightly different from the original but I will only be able to tell after about 10-14 days of shampooing.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It does not strip  or dry my hair out&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Love it! It really works. I have really hard water and this stuff defiantly helps. Smells great too. I recommend the hard water treatment too.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo--maybe the only?---out there for well water.  Works great on my dark, color-treated hair.  I always get compliments on my shiny, long hair!</li>
    <li> I was about to get a water softener installed because our hard water was making my hair a frizzy mess.  As a last-ditch effort, I ordered the Malibu C Hard water wellness shampoo and conditioner.  I was not expecting any real difference and assumed it would go into my &amp;#34;product graveyard&amp;#34; drawer.  I was so pleasantly surprised!  Although your hair feels rough and not at all silky when it is still wet (like you get from regular conditioner), there was a huge difference after I blew it dry.  I have been using this for a few months now, and can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> We are on a community well and the water is very hard. my wife&#x27;s beautician recommended this shampoo as her hair had a green tint, she&#x27;s blonde. The green tint is all gone,using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Keeps my blonde hair in its right color range. I shower in hard water and this helps a lot.</li>
