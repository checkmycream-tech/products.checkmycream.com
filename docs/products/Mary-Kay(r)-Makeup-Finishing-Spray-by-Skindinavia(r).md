    <li> I was impressed with this product :-)  Several years ago I used a finishing spray....can&#x27;t remember the brand.  I liked it, but when I needed to replace it, it was just too pricy!  This one is a better fit in my budget, and works every bit as well.  The spray wasn&#x27;t quite as fine as I had hoped, but it didn&#x27;t cause my makeup to run or smudge and kept me fresh looking all day.  I&#x27;d certainly recommend it :-)</li>
    <li> Usually by noon my makeup has mostly disappeared.  With this spray, it lasts until I wash it off. I use it over the mk cc cream and mineral foundation.</li>
    <li> Use this a lot and am happy with it.  Helps extend the life of my makeup on those really long days!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long. I sweat a lot and have a very greasy face. This last about an hour or two depending on the weather.</li>
    <li> This finishing spray is amazing! It helps my foundation stay on all day. It&#x27;s a must have! Quick delivery also!</li>
    <li> The price was great and I like using MK products.</li>
    <li> I love Mary kay and this just might be my favorite product! Keeps my makeup lasting all day. Product arrived on time with no damages.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but doesn&#x27;t make a noticeable difference in appearance.  Difficult to keep from spraying a bit onto hair at sides of head.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It works great! It&#x27;s very light weight and my makeup stays on all day. For the price, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Has a very strong alcohol smell but i like it. Although i wish it was a mist as opposed to a spray.</li>

    <li> I was told this product basically froze your makeup in place. I found this not to be the case. I still seem to have my make up wiped off and my eye makeup get clumpy my the end of my work day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MARY KAY AND THIS FINISH SRPAY IS JUST AMAZING !</li>
    <li> I wear Mary Kay foundation and concealer everyday and even though I use the finishing spray makeup still fades throughout the day. I wonder if it even works. Probably won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> i have very oily skin and this does not work on oily skin so my makeup didn&#x27;t stay put. I did try Iman time control and it works great and my makeup doesn&#x27;t melt off.</li>
    <li> Love the feeling of this. It is soft and clean on your face</li>
    <li> Came as ordered. The box was a little bent up, but product was fine. And the price was really good!</li>
