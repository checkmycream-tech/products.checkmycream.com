      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it</li>
      <li>This is a great tool for nails and would highly recommend it and it is the best size especially for travelling.</li>
      <li>and I love how easy it is to use.</li>
      <li>Very nice and professional!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a licensed nail tech and this drill suits me just fine.  </li>
      <li>This is a ok drill, i had a hassle retrieveing it first and for most and the manufactures attitude were not that of a helpful one in answering my question and there was not even a number to contact</li>

      <li>It takes a little getting used to for those who are just learning at home on their own but works GREAT and is well worth the $money$ if you want more bang for your buck</li>
      <li>GREAT deal for the money and extra attachments are inexpensive and work well with this machine!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m  licensed professional, and this drill works just as good as a drill in a salon.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my new drill that I just purchased.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s much better than the others I was looking at, and the price is right.  </li>
      <li>Changing implements is quick and easy</li>
      <li>If you do your own nails or someone else&#x27;s, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This nail drill also has a pretty good speed on it, it says it goes from 2000 to 35000 rpm, and it does seem pretty powerful.</li>
      <li>Anyways, this is a fantastic drill and it arrivesd pretty quick.</li>
      <li>This product is simple to use, very light weight and has a slim design making it easy to hold.</li>
      <li>and thats exactly what this one is!</li>
      <li>This little tool works great for me.  </li>
      <li>The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the drill bits could fit a bit tighter, nonetheless, they fit fine and don&#x27;t slip off while in use.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product in the hopes that it would provide a more professional look for my nails.  </li>
      <li>The one thing I would have liked included is a storage case, would happily have paid a few extra $s for that convenience.</li>
      <li>but it is affordable and well worth the money.</li>
      <li>glad I finally got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
      <li>The reason why I got on amazon and got a nail drill in the first place was because mine died and I needed one that was POWERFUL but INEXPENSIVE....</li>
      <li>what I expected and MORE!</li>
      <li>and it also takes attachments I had purchased a while ago on clearance that didnt fit in my old machine...</li>
      <li>The package I received is a liitle different than what the picture shows but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Love the different  attachments/ bits that come with it.  </li>
      <li>I accomplished a natural shaping of  my toe-nails and sanded callus&#x27;s smooth as silk on my first application.  </li>
      <li>B001185HC6 NEW - MY MANICURIST PRO Powerful Nail Drill w/ Bits Acrylics Gels]]&lt;br /&gt;The ordering process &amp; the product received were exactly as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>I love how small yet mighty this nail drill is.</li>
      <li>so i had to purchase a bit that i could use for acrylic and to fit my sanders properly, so</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>You can use it fast or slower.</li>
      <li>It works very well</li>
      <li>Thanks...</li>
      <li>other than that it&#x27;s an ok product and will do the job.</li>
      <li>(if you have a Moto-tool with a quick change chuck, it&#x27;s the same thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Changing them out was not real user friendly.  </li>
      <li>B001185HC6 NEW - MY MANICURIST PRO</li>
      <li>sometimes the little knob that allows you to secure the bits pop off.</li>
      <li>I can fill my acrylic nails and make them look as professional as the salon.  </li>
      <li>It might work for natural nails, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>is for natural nail not for acrylic</li>
      <li>Thank you very much for making such an item avaiable to an at home, do-it-yourself only on myself manicurist!</li>
      <li>If it can break off after using it twice there is apparently a flaw in the manufacturing of the bit.  </li>
      <li>they are false advertising, many will say that the drill is 2000 to 25000 rpm</li>

<li> so please don&#x27;t waste your money one that garbage nail drill.</li>
<li> and it is small as it says on the package</li>
<li> I use it on my woodworking to remove the burrs and small pieces that are difficult to get out with my fingers and other tools.  </li>
<li> if you do not have a problem going threw all of that then by all mean purchase it</li>
<li> WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
<li> Poorly made product (reminded me of a toy bought at a dime store).</li>
<li> highly recommend this product you will not be disappointed !!</li>
<li> i had the wrong bit the one it comes with</li>
<li> Too bad the Vogue name is on this product....</li>
<li> It is very inconvenient using rechargeable devices you don&#x27;t use often.</li>

    <li> I purchased this product in the hopes that it would provide a more professional look for my nails.  It has achieved that and more.  I can fill my acrylic nails and make them look as professional as the salon.  The drill bits are easy to change and this is a great product.  If you do your own nails or someone else&#x27;s, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product is just what I wanted. I love the variable speeds and it fits in the hand well. It has a great feel while using. Extremely easy to exchange the attachments. I could not be happier with this product and I have had others before, but all battery operated.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this drill at first because I had bought one similar on ebay.(FYI i would not reccommend anyone buying that pink drill that they sell on ebay.. they are false advertising, many will say that the drill is 2000 to 25000 rpm but when you get it it says it only goes up to 13000 rpm, but not only that it didn&#x27;t work.. so please don&#x27;t waste your money one that garbage nail drill. Anyways, this is a fantastic drill and it arrivesd pretty quick. The package I received is a liitle different than what the picture shows but it&#x27;s ok. This nail drill also has a pretty good speed on it, it says it goes from 2000 to 35000 rpm, and it does seem pretty powerful.

    <li> This is a great tool for nails and would highly recommend it and it is the best size especially for travelling.Am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Poorly made product (reminded me of a toy bought at a dime store). The casing is made of plastic and the ON/OFF switch indicates it to be a variable speed (but is not).  The slightest pressure you put on the surface you are buffing will stop the rotation.  Be careful if you are working near a delicate area like the cuticles because the tip gets hot.  Too bad the Vogue name is on this product....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  licensed professional, and this drill works just as good as a drill in a salon.  Its a great product for a great price.

    <li> I love my nail drill.  It gets the job done. If you do your own nails...this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This product is simple to use, very light weight and has a slim design making it easy to hold. Changing implements is quick and easy (if you have a Moto-tool with a quick change chuck, it&#x27;s the same thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item to replace a rechargeable unit I had for several years. It is very inconvenient using rechargeable devices you don&#x27;t use often. When you need it, it needs to be recharged first and that (for mine) takes at least 10 hours. Not much help when I want to use it NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a device that I can just plug in and use is wonderful.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH FOR ACRYLICS.  It might work for natural nails, I don&#x27;t know.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
    <li> This is a ok drill, i had a hassle retrieveing it first and for most and the manufactures attitude were not that of a helpful one in answering my question and there was not even a number to contact then you have to go threw amazon if something happens but it was located and sent to my correct address when i revieved it i had the wrong bit the one it comes with is for natural nail not for acrylic and it is small as it says on the package so the sanders don&#x27;t even stay on properly so i had to purchase a bit that i could use for acrylic and to fit my sanders properly, so if you do not have a problem going threw all of that then by all mean purchase it</li>
    <li> After searching around, includding Sally&#x27;s, this drill set was by far the best bang for the buck. It has a variable speed rotating on and off switch. I wish it had an on and off switch instead of a rotating wheel but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This little tool works great for me.  I use it on my woodworking to remove the burrs and small pieces that are difficult to get out with my fingers and other tools.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it - it&#x27;s much better than the others I was looking at, and the price is right.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time. Has a roller to set the speed. You can use it fast or slower. Works great!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my new drill that I just purchased. It was shipped in a timely manner. All of the attachments that were promised to be included were there. I love how small yet mighty this nail drill is. It performs as well as the more expensive drills that are on the market, but I didn&#x27;t have to pay the expensive drill prices to receive a quality drill.  As a Licensed Nail Specialist I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>

    <li> I work on my own nails and this drill has made the process easier and more professional looking !  Love the different  attachments/ bits that come with it.  Changing them out was not real user friendly.  A good drill overal and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars because its faulty.  One of the drill bits broke off under my nail and the piece that broke off was stuck under my nail in my flesh, no it wasn&#x27;t on highest power.  If it can break off after using it twice there is apparently a flaw in the manufacturing of the bit.  Be cautious when using the long metal bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed nail tech and this drill suits me just fine.  Several different speeds which allow me to do anything I need.</li>
    <li> Works okay.  Needs better speed control.</li>
    <li> Awesome product worth every dollar has great power and easy to use I highly recommend this product you will not be disappointed !!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, designed for easy manipulation,  adjustable speed, more attachments than the average nail-care regime requires (but you never know), and what brings all these advantage together to serve best is the AC/DC power source! Instead of the &amp;#34;rechargeable&amp;#34;  type prone to weakening power before the chore is finished.  I accomplished a natural shaping of  my toe-nails and sanded callus&#x27;s smooth as silk on my first application.  It saves me time with quick _and_ superior results over the old filing board method and it&#x27;s very, fairly priced.  I recommend the Vogue Pro 6600 to anyone like myself who takes satisfaction in the details of their grooming.</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail drill to make life easier for me as I do my own acrylic nails at home. it works well just wished it had more bits. sometimes the little knob that allows you to secure the bits pop off. other than that it&#x27;s an ok product and will do the job.</li>
    <li> Great tool for the price</li>
    <li> Just what I was hoping for.  Recently purchased a home gel system, and this was the &#x27;missing component&#x27; to make the home process simpler.  Works great.  The one thing I would have liked included is a storage case, would happily have paid a few extra $s for that convenience.</li>
    <li> Perfect nail dremel. It works very well and I love how easy it is to use. I recommend it.</li>
