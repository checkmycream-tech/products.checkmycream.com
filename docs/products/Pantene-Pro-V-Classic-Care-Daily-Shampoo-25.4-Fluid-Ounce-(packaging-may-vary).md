      <li>, I love the scent</li>
      <li>For many years I&#x27;ve been using Pantene Clarifying formula.  </li>
      <li>What more can you say?  </li>
      <li>how easily it rinses out of my hair.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and the Classic shampoo works best for me while showering.  </li>
      <li>My hair is always shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>Pantene pro-V Classis Care Daily Shampoo works great on my hair</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and priced right, good deal.</li>
      <li>and I thought I ordered Classic Clean which is a product I have used and really liked.</li>
      <li>For long hair this works great.</li>
      <li>My hair just feels so clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I also had to pour out much more Classic shampoo than the Clarifying shampoo in order to clean my hair.  </li>
      <li>The classic Pantene is my favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is the only kind my husband will use and this has been so much cheaper and better than buying anywhere else.</li>
      <li>This works well for me and love how Amazon offers subscribe &amp; save for it.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t leave my hair quite as soft as I would&#x27;ve liked, but I like that it doesn&#x27;t have such an overpowering fragrance like so many shampoos have.</li>
      <li>I purchased it here on Amazon, and it was quite economical.  </li>
      <li>With a tiny bit of Clarifying shampoo I can produce a lot more lather and get my hair squeaky clean without the slimy feeling in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No surprises here this was exactly what I used to be able to find at Wally world until it was changed out for newer different versions.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and light, not overwhelming at all.  </li>
      <li>After the first shipment I signed up for subscribe and save</li>
      <li>The Classic Clean gave more fluff and lift.</li>
      <li>Cleans what little hair I have just fine and is cheap.  </li>
      <li>All I really want in a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It came in a very generous 25.4 oz bottle for a pack of 2...</li>
      <li>first thing I noticed when using Classic was the lack of a rich lather and a deep cleaning feeling.  </li>
      <li>The Classic Care is not right for my hair which is very fine.</li>
      <li>my hair just feels cleaner than with most other shampoos.</li>
      <li>After rinsing, there was definitely no squeaky clean feeling but</li>
      <li>This shampoo is Classic Care</li>
      <li>In comparison between the two products, the Classic is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find the Clarifying formula anymore, I decided to try Pantene Classic.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to return the product, Classic Care, but had thrown away the box it arrived in.</li>
      <li>After a second application of the shampoo, the lather generated was initially a little more but then quickly disappeared after vigorous scrubbing.  </li>
      <li>It is very gentle, but lathers very well at the same time.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a very light fragrance that is not overwhelming and</li>
      <li>its cheap but not worth spending money.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I expected -- it cleans my hair and doesn&#x27;t have too much perfume.  </li>
      <li>shampoo in the house with no trouble.</li>
      <li>While the Clarifying formulas was a clear liquid, the Classic shampoo is a milky white creamlike formula.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, and will definitely repurchase.</li>
      <li>Some shampoos just aren&#x27;t strong enough to make my hair feel clean, while others, even Pantene brand, leave a strange residue on my hair that makes it feel dirty even when I first get out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>I do not use no other shampoo but this one.</li>
      <li>It did not dry out my hair or scalp, and left my hair shiny and healthy-looking.  </li>

    <li> This shampoo is Classic Care and I thought I ordered Classic Clean which is a product I have used and really liked. The Classic Care is not right for my hair which is very fine. It makes hair too limp. The Classic Clean gave more fluff and lift. I wanted to return the product, Classic Care, but had thrown away the box it arrived in. I don&#x27;t know if I ordered the wrong product or if wrong one was sent.</li>
    <li> No surprises here this was exactly what I used to be able to find at Wally world until it was changed out for newer different versions. I always liked  this one best...</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems to leave a residue on my hair. My hair has a tendency to be oily and within 12 hours of shampooing with this, my hair is already feeling oily</li>
    <li> We have very soft water and this shampoo just makes the most wonderful foam when washing your hair. My hair just feels so clean and refreshed. I like the fact that it is just the shampoo so we can choose our favorite hair conditioner to treat our hair with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light fragrance that is not overwhelming and my hair just feels cleaner than with most other shampoos. This is a very good product and you will like using it.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I expected -- it cleans my hair and doesn&#x27;t have too much perfume.  Develops a nice lather.  Seems identical to the Pantene Pro-V you buy anywhere else.  After the first shipment I signed up for subscribe and save so I wouldn&#x27;t forget to get it.</li>
    <li> I use all the time - although I switch off periodically because hair will become too conditioned or too dry depending on the product - so don&#x27;t use same product continually or a long period of time</li>
    <li> This is the pantene that you all know and love.  If you&#x27;ve never used it before then you should know it is the best hair cleaner I have ever used.  Amazon&#x27;s price is very good.</li>
    <li> gives me dandruff. I would rather stay with head and shoulder. Not for everyday use. its cheap but not worth spending money.</li>
    <li> The item was as described &amp; would order again! Fast delivery and priced right, good deal. Not much could go wrong with a name brand product :)</li>
    <li> great price for the subscription. shampoo in the house with no trouble. however, the bottle is a little heavy for me. Might look for smaller size next time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great and leaves my hair feeling and looking good and healthy. I would recommend this produce to anyone.</li>
    <li> For many years I&#x27;ve been using Pantene Clarifying formula.  When I couldn&#x27;t find the Clarifying formula anymore, I decided to try Pantene Classic.  While the Clarifying formulas was a clear liquid, the Classic shampoo is a milky white creamlike formula.  In comparison between the two products, the Classic is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when using Classic was the lack of a rich lather and a deep cleaning feeling.  After a second application of the shampoo, the lather generated was initially a little more but then quickly disappeared after vigorous scrubbing.  After rinsing, there was definitely no squeaky clean feeling but instead a sort of a silky but slimy feel in my hair.  I also had to pour out much more Classic shampoo than the Clarifying shampoo in order to clean my hair.  With a tiny bit of Clarifying shampoo I can produce a lot more lather and get my hair squeaky clean without the slimy feeling in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classic is terrible.</li>
    <li> Pantene pro-V Classis Care Daily Shampoo works great on my hair, I love the scent how easily it rinses out of my hair.</li>
    <li> People wonder how I get my hair so shiny.  Now, you know too.  Great product and home hair care type budget.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, about 2 month ago they must have changed something in the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, I got a terrible rush - could not even sleep at night, it itched so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took me about a week to figure out this shampoo was the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using any other shampoo caused the issue to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would somehow notify of ingredient changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I hope this was not some sort of quality issue in shampoo manufacturing - this would be even more disturbing for me,</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my hair quite as soft as I would&#x27;ve liked, but I like that it doesn&#x27;t have such an overpowering fragrance like so many shampoos have.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and doesn&#x27;t use chemicals that are dangerous.  What more can you say?  Well, how about GREAT! OK!!!</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, but can&#x27;t get it anymore!  I have sensitive skin and the Classic shampoo works best for me while showering.  Too bad!</li>
    <li> The classic Pantene is my favorite shampoo. I have dark brown wavy hair that I straighten or do big curls. My hair is always shiny and smooth. I get comments all the time. I also like it because I can use it everyday. I have tried others in the Pantene line (the shampoo and conditioner combo) and find this to be my fave.</li>
    <li> Cleans what little hair I have just fine and is cheap.  All I really want in a shampoo.  Lather, rinse, don&#x27;t repeat.</li>
    <li> Its shampoo but the price was good and I  get extra for Christmas time to give to my daughters they do like Pantene</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and need to wash my hair every day. Some shampoos just aren&#x27;t strong enough to make my hair feel clean, while others, even Pantene brand, leave a strange residue on my hair that makes it feel dirty even when I first get out of the shower.  This works well for me and love how Amazon offers subscribe &amp; save for it.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind my husband will use and this has been so much cheaper and better than buying anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I do not use no other shampoo but this one. It helps my hair stay healthy and shiny. My hair looks the best that it has ever been since I started using this item. If I was anyone else, I would throw all other shampoos that you got and start using this one. It would make look great. I would give this two thumbs up</li>
    <li> This shampoo is excellent!  It is very gentle, but lathers very well at the same time.  The scent is nice and light, not overwhelming at all.  It did not dry out my hair or scalp, and left my hair shiny and healthy-looking.  I purchased it here on Amazon, and it was quite economical.  It came in a very generous 25.4 oz bottle for a pack of 2...a great deal for the price and also the quality.  I highly recommend this product, and will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. You need to be careful when buying Pantene products, some of them have so much oil in them that my hair looked cleaner before using it and very oily and dirty after using it. This shampoo is good however.</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoos I have ever used. Love the way my hair feels and looks. For long hair this works great. And the smell is awesome. Has even helped my hair from being so frizzy in Florida humidity.</li>
