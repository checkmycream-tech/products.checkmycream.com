### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I thought it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>Awesome product.</li>
      <li>It is shame, because the coloring is beautiful!</li>
      <li>Best metallic polish ever!  </li>
      <li>OPI is wonderful and this is a great color!</li>
      <li>it awesome!</li>
      <li>Really a perfect self leveling polish, drys to a mirror like finish that is to die for!  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, this nail polish is AMAZING!!</li>
      <li>The colors on this is beautiful.</li>
      <li>This polish is beautiful.</li>
      <li>It looks great when you put it on.</li>
      <li>Awesome color ate an amazing price</li>
      <li>Do smooth out your nails to get the best finish.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not mirror-bright, but it&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>Pretty impressive.</li>
      <li>(OK maybe not quite that reflective but close!)</li>
      <li>Amazing -</li>
      <li>This is a really nice chrome nail polish.</li>
      <li>Tricky to put on but beautiful once you get it right.</li>
      <li>this nail polish is so elegant and nice</li>
      <li>I love Gwen and I love OPI</li>
      <li>but that has more to do with the make up of the color.</li>
      <li>I got so many compliments</li>
      <li>However this is a stunning shiny chrome.</li>
      <li>Wears off in a day w/o top coat.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>Most reviews have said the polish chips</li>
      <li>and I love metallics</li>
      <li>I love this polish</li>
      <li>I love this color</li>
      <li>suppose if you really want a high sheen chrome finish you could just apply and hope for the best until it gets nicked, but like most metallic polishes it isn&#x27;t all that durable without a top coat.</li>
      <li>A good top coat that doesn&#x27;t affect the polish that much is Picture Polish revolution and Seche Vite.</li>
      <li>For OPI, I am a huge fan.</li>
      <li>so buff before you put this one or it wont be smooth</li>
      <li>Fun polish!</li>
      <li>a day fun to wear!</li>
      <li>Definitely looked like the most metallic polish I own.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I buy OPI, because it lasts for so much longer than most brands.</li>
      <li>Which is true.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The directions do say that they are really only good for one night usage - but I couldn&#x27;t even get the polish to look right at all, so I don&#x27;t even know if that claim is true.</li>
      <li>I usually have very good experiences with my orders.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that it lasted, for the most part, for about a week.</li>
      <li>This nail polish is definitely fun.</li>
      <li>But it was well worth it</li>
      <li>I was really excited and was so happy when I got the box only to find it was a completely different polish.</li>
      <li>(Says so right on the packaging</li>
      <li>No I am not bitter :)</li>
      <li>Though its a really pretty color, it&#x27;s not what I ordered.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>This polish is very fussy -- you really have to follow the instructions -- but it&#x27;s the closest thing to a true mirror polish out there.  </li>
      <li>I applied with a top coat because I wanted it to last longer, and it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used top coat to make it last more than the expected 24hrs</li>
      <li>It will only last one night if you don&#x27;t use top coat and many top coats cause the polish to dull somewhat.</li>
      <li>Very shiny.</li>
      <li>Not exactly what I was expecting, but I still love it.</li>
      <li>I love the color, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it says its only shiny for one night.</li>
      <li>I had really high hopes for this.</li>
      <li>I  normally love OPI, but this is not something you want to waste money on.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Only wish it was a little more chrome like!  </li>
      <li>included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color itself is fine, but it&#x27;s very similar to a color I already have from a different brand.</li>
      <li>this is a pretty color its meant for only one day wear and without a top coat on me it chipped within a few hours of me putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
      <li>Top coat dulls the chrome effect a bit but helps it last.</li>
      <li>This chips really easy and won&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m not sure why they advise against using a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I used a top coat anyway, and it did not hurt the color at all, and it has lasted as long as any other OPI polish.</li>
      <li>If your nail is large enough you can use it as a mirror to apply your make up!</li>
      <li>My only gripe is that it doesnt last more than a few hours.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very fun and dramatic color I received it fast!</li>
      <li>Use a top coat to get it to last longer, but be VERY delicate with its application.</li>

<li> Which is not true (except for this particular vendor maybe.)  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mirror or chrome color of polish for a long time and finally decided to try &#x27;Push and Shove it&#x27;.</li>
<li> or it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
<li> Single coating, double coating, it didn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
<li> This polish comes with a warning: &amp;#34;Like all Limited Engagement events, Push and Shove is intended for One Night Only wear.&amp;#34; I would not have bought it if I&#x27;d known it had to be reapplied every day!</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really streaky and hard to use.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll try it with some other basecoats and update if it helps, but I&#x27;ve applied this to naked nails and coated nails.&lt;br</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t tell you how much better it looks with the base</li>
<li> Before buying, click on the list of sellers and be sure to choose one that has a note that the base coat is</li>
<li> /&gt;Another word of warning: Some sellers are selling the set with Lay Down</li>
<li> but it does take the shine down a smidge.  </li>
<li> I have to say I&#x27;ve been a little disappointed by the Gwen Stefani collection, which I had been really excited about.</li>
<li> I followed the instructions, used the base coat, no top coat, and everything worked out just fine.</li>
<li> It did look slightly less chrome-like after day three, and by day 5 or six it had lost a lot of luster but not so much that it looked bad.</li>
<li> make sure you use the base that comes with it, or it doesnt work as well!</li>
<li> wear it with all black outfit you will rock !!</li>
<li> The vendor also said that the base in only included if you buy the entire collection.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s SO freakin pretty, but it applies horribly.</li>
<li> I eve ntried with another regular base, as well as a gel base, but it all turned out the same.</li>
<li> Down That Base&amp;#34; base coat that is supposed to be sold with each bottle.</li>
<li> However, I used the base coat provided in the package, let it dry for a long time, and the nail polish itself just stripped everything away and made my nails look horrible.</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> It very frustrating.</li>
<li> As another reviewer said, this should come with a small bottle of base coat.  </li>
<li> I would recommend checking with each vendor before purchase to avoid disappointment.</li>
<li> Maybe I got a bad bottle, who knows.</li>
<li> well, I didn&#x27;t get any. :(</li>
<li> The seller did not include the base coat that is supposed to come with it, so there&#x27;s an issue there.</li>
<li> Do not use a base coat except for the one that comes with the product.</li>
<li> The vendor pointed out that the description does not say it comes with the base.</li>

    <li> The seller did not include the base coat that is supposed to come with it, so there&#x27;s an issue there. HOWEVER, this nail polish is AMAZING!! So close to a Minx manicure it is sickening! I got so many compliments and I could not stop looking at them! Use a top coat to get it to last longer, but be VERY delicate with its application. I used Seche Vite (also bought on Amazon). Do not use a base coat except for the one that comes with the product. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> one of the shiniest nail polishes i&#x27;ve ever seen. make sure you use the base that comes with it, or it doesnt work as well! would buy again and again and again</li>
    <li> This polish comes with a warning: &amp;#34;Like all Limited Engagement events, Push and Shove is intended for One Night Only wear.&amp;#34; I would not have bought it if I&#x27;d known it had to be reapplied every day! That&#x27;s why I buy OPI, because it lasts for so much longer than most brands. It also says to not apply a topcoat. Most reviews have said the polish chips horribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I used a top coat anyway, and it did not hurt the color at all, and it has lasted as long as any other OPI polish. So I&#x27;m not sure why they advise against using a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another word of warning: Some sellers are selling the set with Lay Down That Base included. Some are breaking up the set (can&#x27;t imagine why?) and selling it without. Before buying, click on the list of sellers and be sure to choose one that has a note that the base coat is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color itself is fine, but it&#x27;s very similar to a color I already have from a different brand. I have to say I&#x27;ve been a little disappointed by the Gwen Stefani collection, which I had been really excited about.</li>
    <li> this nail polish is so elegant and nice I would totally recommend it !! wear it with all black outfit you will rock !!</li>
    <li> I purchased from vendor &amp;#34;General Supply&amp;#34; and did not get the &amp;#34;Lay Down That Base&amp;#34; base coat that is supposed to be sold with each bottle. The vendor pointed out that the description does not say it comes with the base. Which is true. The vendor also said that the base in only included if you buy the entire collection. Which is not true (except for this particular vendor maybe.)  I would recommend checking with each vendor before purchase to avoid disappointment. However this is a stunning shiny chrome. If your nail is large enough you can use it as a mirror to apply your make up! (OK maybe not quite that reflective but close!) Can&#x27;t tell you how much better it looks with the base cuz,  well, I didn&#x27;t get any. :( ...No I am not bitter :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s SO freakin pretty, but it applies horribly. I&#x27;ll try it with some other basecoats and update if it helps, but I&#x27;ve applied this to naked nails and coated nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really streaky and hard to use. If you&#x27;re using it as an accent nail, then maybe its no biggie. I had really high hopes for this. I love Gwen and I love OPI and I love metallics so I thought it would be perfect. Maybe I got a bad bottle, who knows.</li>
    <li> Very shiny. Product delivers. Check it out!</li>
    <li> It looks great when you put it on. Shiny like chrome. Amazing - but, it won&#x27;t last. This chips really easy and won&#x27;t last long. For a night on the town, its fab. Bad for a pedi, awful for a weekly mani, and awful as a stamping polish.</li>
    <li> Tricky to put on but beautiful once you get it right. Wears off in a day w/o top coat. Top coat dulls the chrome effect a bit but helps it last. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments wearing it.</li>
    <li> This polish is beautiful. Not exactly what I was expecting, but I still love it. The label says it&#x27;s for one night only wear, but I&#x27;m on day two and it&#x27;s only chipped a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> I love the color, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it says its only shiny for one night. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but that has more to do with the make up of the color. Wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Awesome color ate an amazing price</li>
    <li> This nail polish is definitely fun. I followed the instructions, used the base coat, no top coat, and everything worked out just fine. I was surprised that it lasted, for the most part, for about a week. It did look slightly less chrome-like after day three, and by day 5 or six it had lost a lot of luster but not so much that it looked bad. It looked like a non-chrome silver polish. I took it off before it chipped. Pretty impressive.</li>
    <li> Best metallic polish ever!  Do smooth out your nails to get the best finish.  Really a perfect self leveling polish, drys to a mirror like finish that is to die for!  I have used top coat to make it last more than the expected 24hrs and it does work but it does take the shine down a smidge.  Must have for polish addicts.</li>
    <li> this is a pretty color its meant for only one day wear and without a top coat on me it chipped within a few hours of me putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;it looks like liquid silver. and will show every imperfection on your nail bed... so buff before you put this one or it wont be smooth</li>
    <li> OPI is wonderful and this is a great color!</li>
    <li> I love this polish it looks like confetti all over your nails. It doesnt chip or peel. I will purchase this one again!</li>
    <li> The colors on this is beautiful. However, I used the base coat provided in the package, let it dry for a long time, and the nail polish itself just stripped everything away and made my nails look horrible. Single coating, double coating, it didn&#x27;t seem to matter. I  normally love OPI, but this is not something you want to waste money on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions do say that they are really only good for one night usage - but I couldn&#x27;t even get the polish to look right at all, so I don&#x27;t even know if that claim is true. You apply a coat to your nails, but it still strips away and looks awful before you even get finished painting your nails. I eve ntried with another regular base, as well as a gel base, but it all turned out the same. It is shame, because the coloring is beautiful!</li>
    <li> I used it to create chrome silver French tips on my home manicure. I applied with a top coat because I wanted it to last longer, and it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you really want a high sheen chrome finish you could just apply and hope for the best until it gets nicked, but like most metallic polishes it isn&#x27;t all that durable without a top coat.</li>
    <li> Fun polish! Love the color. Only wish it was a little more chrome like!  But it was well worth it a day fun to wear!</li>
    <li> Shipping was great, came with base coat. Trying to decide if it is anyway different than silver. For OPI, I am a huge fan. This, I am not a admirer of. Sorry</li>
    <li> This polish is very fussy -- you really have to follow the instructions -- but it&#x27;s the closest thing to a true mirror polish out there.  (Layla effects mirror chrome is close, but even fussier.)  It&#x27;s not mirror-bright, but it&#x27;s good.  As another reviewer said, this should come with a small bottle of base coat.  I bought from E-Bridge and had no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mirror or chrome color of polish for a long time and finally decided to try &#x27;Push and Shove it&#x27;. I was really excited and was so happy when I got the box only to find it was a completely different polish. It was the sparkly one in the Gwen Stefani line. I&#x27;ve emailed Amazon with no response. It very frustrating. I usually have very good experiences with my orders. I&#x27;m a Prime member and order a lot of stuff off of Amazon. Though its a really pretty color, it&#x27;s not what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I love this color it awesome! This color goes with everything it&#x27;s a very fun and dramatic color I received it fast!</li>
    <li> Definitely looked like the most metallic polish I own. My only gripe is that it doesnt last more than a few hours. (Says so right on the packaging so it wasn&#x27;t a surprise)</li>
    <li> This is a really nice chrome nail polish. Opaque in 1 coat. It will only last one night if you don&#x27;t use top coat and many top coats cause the polish to dull somewhat. A good top coat that doesn&#x27;t affect the polish that much is Picture Polish revolution and Seche Vite. Also, you should use the basecoat that it comes with or it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Understood why its only for one night wear but you can make it work for a week. ;)</li>
