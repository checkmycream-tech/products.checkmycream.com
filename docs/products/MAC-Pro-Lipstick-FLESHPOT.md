    <li> This is good to put  on under a pale lipstick as a base ,  but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it alone. I bought it because I have been unable to find an aveda product  that was a pale lip pencil. This  would be better for my purposes if it was thicker, had more coverage but its ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m VERY disappointed with the color because the color in the picture is much darker than in person. It is way too light and I don&#x27;t care for it at all. I&#x27;m a Mac user and never thought I would be this disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite nude lipstick.  It&#x27;s rich and creamy and keeps lips soft.  Works so well when applied before a lipgloss.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great nude lipstick, look no farther. This is excellent.</li>
    <li> Pretty as a base color. I like to use it to tone down any super bold colors that are scary to wear alone.     But Fleshpot is a bit too pale for me to wear it alone. But I&#x27;m a medium/lighter golden skin tone. Maybe someone a little tanner could pull it off. I heard Kim Kardashian wears this color sometimes</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING! I bought some for myself and my daughter came over and fell in love with it...soooo I&#x27;ll be buying some more :)&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!</li>

    <li> I use this product with darker lipsticks which works ok.  Just lighter than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> great over other colors</li>
    <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS LIPSTICK! I have always used concealer and lipbalm (combined) to achieve the pale lip look. I cannot count how much money I have wasted on lipsticks throughout the years that promised the nude color I wanted so when I found this I was very skeptical. Had to get used to it because it does have a hint of pink color, but this lipstick is beautiful. I will be a lifelong purchaser of this product!</li>
    <li> Looks like I pressed my lips in flour, almost white. I&#x27;m still very tan so I&#x27;m hoping with my winter coloring it will be better.</li>
    <li> Color would b great if it wasnt cakie flaky see through. It feels like dollor store garbage. So disapointed especially for the price.what a rip off</li>
    <li> It truly is flesh colored if you are a person of lighter skin. It was way to light for me, but I do love all MAC products, just wasn&#x27;t into this color.</li>

    <li> makes my lips look funny think its too dry... the color is nice maybe with a little bit of clear gloss might help</li>
