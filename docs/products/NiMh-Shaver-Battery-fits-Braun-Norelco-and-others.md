      <li>It did the job for me and it works great.</li>
      <li>wich was a nice thing.</li>
      <li>It was very easy to do</li>
      <li>I had to trim the tabs with sisors to fit in the circuit board but the thing runs so good</li>
      <li>original lasted 5 years, and I&#x27;ve replaced it once before...and the replacement lasted 4 years!</li>
      <li>so far it,s great.</li>
      <li>The disassembly is easy with 4 torqx screws (http://youtu.be/D6jRpCnB8T4).  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re still working fine.</li>
      <li>was able to shave right away after 5 days without.</li>
      <li>You will need soldering skills, but now my shaver is working like the first day I bought it or even better.</li>
      <li>They work well and provide full power until they need to be recharged.  </li>
      <li>Overall a good experience.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping in a padded envelope.  </li>
      <li>regret is not ordering a month ago when my shaver first went on the fritz.</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>All I can say so far is that the charge seems to be comparable to the manufacturer&#x27;s original batteries</li>
      <li>I removed the board with the batteries on it and cut the first two metal tabs where they attach to the batteries, leaving some of these old tabs protruding from the board.  </li>
      <li>and I now a new shaver!  </li>
      <li>I installed in my Norelco razor less than a year ago and it won&#x27;t hold a charge more than 2 days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this battery.</li>
      <li>I then removed the plastic sleave from the tabs on the new batteries and trimmed them.  </li>
      <li>I gave the product 4 stars because it&#x27;s new</li>
      <li>Runs my razor like it was new.</li>
      <li>for new razor,easy to install, came charged</li>
      <li>This is much easier than trying to completely desolder the old tabs from the board.</li>
      <li>The inside of the razor was a mess with dust/wiskers and was a good opportunity to clean all the parts with a small vacuum or paint brush.  </li>
      <li>Installing these was not difficult but required a soldering iron and basic soldering skills.</li>
      <li>I replaced the battery in my 12 year old shaver and it works like new.</li>
      <li>The metal tab seems to be pretty necessary to keep you from frying the battery if you were to attempt to solder the shaver wires directly onto the battery terminals.</li>
      <li>So far, I believe I was correct.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t needed to charge it again so far.  </li>
      <li>Note that it&#x27;s worth paying some extra money for these &#x27;tabbed&#x27; batteries instead of trying to solder in regular batteries.</li>
      <li>The original battery can only last no more than 2 weeks of use with one full charge.  </li>
      <li>Do yourself a favour and cut the old tabs as close to the old battery as possible and solder new tabs onto old stumps (fold new tabs back over on themselves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The original battery lasted a long time but in its final days had to be charged after every second use.  </li>
      <li>The price was right and we will see how long it will last!</li>
      <li>Instructions were a little slim, used youtube to dismantle the shaver and then all was fine in short order.</li>
      <li>; The original battery is a little tricky to remove, you have to have the right tools and a little know</li>
      <li>I soldered the trimmed off tabs of the new batteries to the tabs left protruding from the board.  </li>
      <li>Inc. They charged a little more than their foreign competitor, but I chose them because when searching for the type of batteries I needed for my razor, I found the correct information on Shaver Outlet&#x27;s web page.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s 3rd week going on since I put it in my Norelco 7800XL Quadra</li>
      <li>solder tabs are too wide to fit into narrow slots of circuit board and will need to be trimmed.</li>
      <li>Luckily I had such a small size.</li>
      <li>and it is too early to tell how long it will last, but</li>

    <li> I installed this battery approximately three weeks ago and used it for two weeks in my Norelco shaver before it needed charging. The original battery lasted a long time but in its final days had to be charged after every second use.  Note; The original battery is a little tricky to remove, you have to have the right tools and a little know how,once out the replacement battery fits perfectly,you just have to re-solder and reassemble and you are back in business.   I gave the product 4 stars because it&#x27;s new and it is too early to tell how long it will last, but so far it,s great.</li>
    <li> It was a bit of a project to install but I was warned by other reviews and the ad. Should have got the Torx tool with it though. Luckily I had such a small size. Runs my razor like it was new.</li>
    <li> The batteries did not work but it just was not worth the effort to return them.  They were just not compatible with my razor as specified.</li>
    <li> Battery would not take a charge. Which sucks after having to solder it in. Not worth the effort to send back.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s 3rd week going on since I put it in my Norelco 7800XL Quadra and I have not charged it. I use it 5 days  a week.</li>
    <li> Used two of these to replace the worn out NC batteries on my Braun Series 5000 shaver.  They work well and provide full power until they need to be recharged.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> All I can say so far is that the charge seems to be comparable to the manufacturer&#x27;s original batteries and they&#x27;re still working fine. Note that it&#x27;s worth paying some extra money for these &#x27;tabbed&#x27; batteries instead of trying to solder in regular batteries. The metal tab seems to be pretty necessary to keep you from frying the battery if you were to attempt to solder the shaver wires directly onto the battery terminals.</li>
    <li> I replaced the battery in my Norelco Quadra 7800xl with this one 3 weeks ago.  I then fully charged the shaver and started using it till now.  I haven&#x27;t needed to charge it again so far.  The original battery can only last no more than 2 weeks of use with one full charge.  I would highly recommend this battery.</li>
    <li> I replaced the battery in my 12 year old shaver and it works like new. I can shave for 1-2 weeks without recharging if I want.</li>
    <li> very good product, saved me $80. for new razor,easy to install, came charged wich was a nice thing. was able to shave right away after 5 days without.</li>
    <li> You will need soldering skills, but now my shaver is working like the first day I bought it or even better.</li>
    <li> just a note to owners of Braun Syncro 7526 (75XX family of shavers): solder tabs are too wide to fit into narrow slots of circuit board and will need to be trimmed. not a big deal, just an extra step. otherwise, battery appears perform as advertised. thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these to replace the batteries in my Braun 7526 razor. Installing these was not difficult but required a soldering iron and basic soldering skills. Once I got them installed, I fully charged up my razor and I have been using it daily for about six weeks on the same charge! I bought these from Shaver Outlet, Inc. They charged a little more than their foreign competitor, but I chose them because when searching for the type of batteries I needed for my razor, I found the correct information on Shaver Outlet&#x27;s web page. They appear to specialize in electric razor parts, so I figured they would know what they were doing and would sell quality parts. So far, I believe I was correct.</li>
    <li> If you order this battery from Buy-it-now-store, you will NOT get the battery pictured, but instead will receive this Amazon item: B005DFT0HG. The difference is 1000mAh less per battery. A total rip off, and false advertising.</li>
    <li> I bought two and replaced the batteries in my Braun 7526.  Quick shipping in a padded envelope.  It was very easy to do and I now a new shaver!  The disassembly is easy with 4 torqx screws (http://youtu.be/D6jRpCnB8T4).  The inside of the razor was a mess with dust/wiskers and was a good opportunity to clean all the parts with a small vacuum or paint brush.  I removed the board with the batteries on it and cut the first two metal tabs where they attach to the batteries, leaving some of these old tabs protruding from the board.  Make sure you note the polarity of the existing batteries (small round tab for + and larger for minus) before you remove them.  The two battreies are in opposite directions on the board.  Then take a small screw driver and gently pry out the two batteries, as they are rubber cemented to the board.  Then you can cut the remaining two tabs, again leaving some of the tab protruding from the board.  I then removed the plastic sleave from the tabs on the new batteries and trimmed them.  I soldered the trimmed off tabs of the new batteries to the tabs left protruding from the board.  This is much easier than trying to completely desolder the old tabs from the board.</li>
    <li> I installed in my Norelco razor less than a year ago and it won&#x27;t hold a charge more than 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original lasted 5 years, and I&#x27;ve replaced it once before...and the replacement lasted 4 years! This one has lasted only 6 months and has had poor service the last 2 months.</li>
    <li> Instructions were a little slim, used youtube to dismantle the shaver and then all was fine in short order. Overall a good experience.</li>
    <li> Package arrived within 4 days of order, even allowing for weekend and Monday holiday.  Item was labelled as 2000mah and came with tabs.  Took 15 minutes to install in Norelco 7140XL.  Even had sufficient charge to immediately turn on my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To install in Philips/Norelco.  Remove 2 rear screws (might be Torx T8, but I used 1/8th flat screwdriver bit), work off the side panels (finger nails or small flat screw driver), take off rear panel.  Remove 3 screws holding the battery compartment together.  To change the battery I tried to unsolder the original battery which was difficult.  Do yourself a favour and cut the old tabs as close to the old battery as possible and solder new tabs onto old stumps (fold new tabs back over on themselves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only regret is not ordering a month ago when my shaver first went on the fritz.</li>
    <li> I had to trim the tabs with sisors to fit in the circuit board but the thing runs so good now I didn&#x27;t realize how under powered it had become.</li>
    <li> It did the job for me and it works great. The price was right and we will see how long it will last!</li>
