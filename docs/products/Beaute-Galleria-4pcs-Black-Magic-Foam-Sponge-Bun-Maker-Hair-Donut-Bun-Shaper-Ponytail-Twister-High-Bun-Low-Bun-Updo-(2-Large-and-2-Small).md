      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>Great for putting up a quick Ballet bun...</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>These work much better to keep buns in place than the kind that are shaped like a donut.</li>
      <li>These are SO easy to use!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe it was so easy to use!</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>so I was able to give the extras away to friends.</li>
      <li>I have used various bun makers, and this is the best we have encountered.</li>
      <li>Believe me I have never been able to put my hair up myself before.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Easy to take off too.</li>
      <li>These are so easy to use.</li>
      <li>They are easy to sleep in</li>
      <li>Worked like a charm and so easy to use.</li>
      <li>but they work fine</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and creates a sturdy clean look.</li>
      <li>Also a great value, I only needed one of each size</li>
      <li>So easy and looks very pretty.  </li>
      <li>These are wonderful and have held up better than some much more expensive name brand ones.  </li>
      <li>They work and are great to just toss your hair up, but if you are looking for that really full bun and have anything but super long thick hair you won&#x27;t be impressed.  </li>
      <li>I love thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use but it doesn&#x27;t work so well with think hair.</li>
      <li>It ends up looking like I have a huge basket on my head or it won&#x27;t even stay in the first place.</li>
      <li>and now I can do a bun in one motion - really useful as I have a baby and don&#x27;t want to cut my hair ;)))</li>
      <li>so we don&#x27;t have to straighten it first.  </li>
      <li>Interesting design that actually works.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>After my mother in law saw me wearing my hair in a &amp;#34;donut&amp;#34; all week camping she wants them!</li>
      <li>Regular bun forms are too full and make her bun look huge.</li>
      <li>if you have thick long hair this will not look great on you!</li>
      <li>I would certainly purchase again and recommend them to others.</li>
      <li>The material is super soft and they are very flexible.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length straight hair, and can get a low chignon or a half-up half-down look easily.</li>
      <li>I used the large one and while I did fit all of my hair on it, there wasn&#x27;t much room left.</li>
      <li>This product is very hair-specific.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I could manage a nice bun within few minutes of trying, as I had no experience of using this thing</li>
      <li>i want something easy, classy and that will last throughout the day.</li>
      <li>We use these for ballet--couldn&#x27;t get my 10 year old ready without them!</li>
      <li>I am not a do-my-hair-every-day pro, so I was a bit scared to try something new...</li>
      <li>Like I had just opened a new bottle of acetone and took a sniff.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Product brand new</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other products like this, and for some reason, these are much harder to use and don&#x27;t make as nice of buns</li>
      <li>There was a few strands that didn&#x27;t stay in, but those are easily secured with bobby pins.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, not only for the bun but for other styles too.</li>
      <li>I bought them for my 4 yr old to use during dance class</li>
      <li>Just a warning to those with sensitive noses.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very helpful having two different sizes, I think if you have thinner hair</li>
      <li>She is a dancer and has to have her hair in a clean bun a few times a week.</li>
      <li>having tried a lot of bun helping tools, this is the first that works with minimal to NO bobby pins at all.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair and have no trouble putting it up using the larger of these donut-makers.</li>
      <li>This would work great for working out since its so tight and put together just no ideal for a night out bun!</li>
      <li>They all work really well not exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Had some difficulties with the first use, but I had it down by the second use.</li>
      <li>These work wonderfully on my super thick hair.</li>
      <li>I have thick medium length hair and these give an okay bun, but you need the round bun wraps for that super thick big bun.  </li>

<li> I have thick medium length hair and these give an okay bun, but you need the round bun wraps for that super thick big bun.  </li>
<li> Holds my hairs well which is a challenge since my hair is baby thin to begin with, My only wish is that the wire on the inside of the foam was a little thicker to withstand more use.</li>
<li> Overall, the product is easy to use and understand but it will not hold my hair in a bun, and to use a bunch of bobby pins to clip the layers under (to hide the product as well) would look silly.</li>
<li> This is ONLY if you have LONG and THICK and STRAIGHT hair.  </li>
<li> it doesnt have buttons at the ends so that it would be closed so that it wont open gradually..</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t have long, one layered hair, I don&#x27;t know that it will work.  </li>
<li> This is my second pack as I gave away me other ones due to short hair and now mine had grown out I needed the larger ones</li>
<li> I am bun challenged and my ten year old daughter inherited my unruly thick curls.</li>
<li> Tried when hair is wet and it created loose curls.  </li>
<li> These things are cheap, silly little things</li>
<li> This did make it easy but its not ideal for thick hair</li>
<li> Helped make a ballerina bun for someone with very thin, straight hair!</li>
<li> Not worth the money</li>
<li> making it look like I have even less hair.  </li>
<li> t o hide the black color</li>
<li> and it was quite a mess.  </li>
<li> I have long thick hair</li>
<li> The bun form worked well for my daughter who has long, thick hair.</li>
<li> I have long (about to my breasts), thick, frizzy, and curly hair.</li>
<li> I would recommend using a hair tie it makes it less messy.</li>

    <li> Excellent. Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
    <li> I have long (about to my breasts), thick, frizzy, and curly hair. I didn&#x27;t think it would work for me, but it did. I used the large one and while I did fit all of my hair on it, there wasn&#x27;t much room left. The bun stayed in my hair all day. There was a few strands that didn&#x27;t stay in, but those are easily secured with bobby pins. My hair isn&#x27;t one layer so it wasn&#x27;t surprising. I would recommend using a hair tie it makes it less messy. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied. If you are having a hard time keeping it in I would suggest making it a bit tighter by pushing one end into the bun a bit.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Holds my hairs well which is a challenge since my hair is baby thin to begin with, My only wish is that the wire on the inside of the foam was a little thicker to withstand more use. One of my sponges fractured after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money does not work</li>
    <li> what was i thinking when i purchased this silly product?</li>
    <li> Poor quality and did not work. A bust.</li>
    <li> No good for long thick hair!</li>
    <li> received item promptly and as promised thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughters dance recital. So easy to use and the perfect bun stayed in for 2 dances. Tap and Acro. I would certainly purchase again and recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> great way to hold hair in bun!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to use but it doesn&#x27;t work so well with think hair.</li>
    <li> Love these! My daughter and I both were them often. So easy to use!!! Good quality. Fast shipping. After my mother in law saw me wearing my hair in a &amp;#34;donut&amp;#34; all week camping she wants them! About to place another order.</li>
    <li> i am not someone who loves to spend a lot of time on hair or makeup. i want something easy, classy and that will last throughout the day. having tried a lot of bun helping tools, this is the first that works with minimal to NO bobby pins at all.</li>
    <li> I am Hispanic and my hair is thick. It doesn&#x27;t work properly. It ends up looking like I have a huge basket on my head or it won&#x27;t even stay in the first place. I end up just putting a tradition bun in my end and skip the hassel. Not worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the donut and it doesn&#x27;t work with my hair well so I thought I would try these. Worked like a charm and so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great for putting up a quick Ballet bun...</li>
    <li> Great product! I could manage a nice bun within few minutes of trying, as I had no experience of using this thing and now I can do a bun in one motion - really useful as I have a baby and don&#x27;t want to cut my hair ;)))</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use. Believe me I have never been able to put my hair up myself before. And they hold and are sturdy</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> These work much better to keep buns in place than the kind that are shaped like a donut. It&#x27;s also very helpful having two different sizes, I think if you have thinner hair you&#x27;ll want to use the smaller one. I use both with my medium thickness hair, the larger one just makes a larger bun. Also a great value, I only needed one of each size so I was able to give the extras away to friends.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful and have held up better than some much more expensive name brand ones.  These work wonderfully on my super thick hair.</li>
    <li> I placed my order and I got it in two days. I love it!. It&#x27;s so easy to use, not only for the bun but for other styles too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in time for my daughter&#x27;s dance pictorial. I just followed the simple directions and wala - I&#x27;ve created a perfect bun for my daughter! I can&#x27;t believe it was so easy to use! I&#x27;ve also tried the longer one for myself and got a perfect bun as well. I wore it all day and it stayed in place. I even had the bun during my Zumba class and it still held its place. I definitely recommend this helpful bun maker!</li>
    <li> The bun form worked well for my daughter who has long, thick hair. Regular bun forms are too full and make her bun look huge. The one drawback, I though, was that the two ends of the form don&#x27;t connect. I used a safety pin, but if it came with a way to connect the two ends, that would make it a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t seem to stay put -- for some reason fall out of my hair, even after being rolled into a bun.</li>
    <li> LOVE these!  Bun making made easy!!</li>
    <li> Very very good I love thanks</li>
    <li> This product is very hair-specific.  If you don&#x27;t have long, one layered hair, I don&#x27;t know that it will work.  I tried both sizes on shoulder length multi-layered hair and it was quite a mess.  I can see how this product MIGHT work but I&#x27;m semi-doubtful.  It&#x27;s basically a wire covered with a mesh.  You would definitely need alot of hair to cover the areas of this product that might show because it&#x27;s not particularly attractive.  Overall, the product is easy to use and understand but it will not hold my hair in a bun, and to use a bunch of bobby pins to clip the layers under (to hide the product as well) would look silly.</li>
    <li> Helped make a ballerina bun for someone with very thin, straight hair!</li>
    <li> I am bun challenged and my ten year old daughter inherited my unruly thick curls. She is a dancer and has to have her hair in a clean bun a few times a week. I have used various bun makers, and this is the best we have encountered. It is easy to use and creates a sturdy clean look. It works with her curly hair so we don&#x27;t have to straighten it first.  Also the bun has held well during performances and classes.</li>
    <li> This is ONLY if you have LONG and THICK and STRAIGHT hair.  My hair comes to my shoulder blades and is curly and not super thick.  When I use this it makes my bun look TINY making it look like I have even less hair.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> They work as they are supposed to. Had some difficulties with the first use, but I had it down by the second use.</li>
    <li> it doesnt have buttons at the ends so that it would be closed so that it wont open gradually..</li>
    <li> These things are cheap, silly little things but they do work as advertised. The big caveat is that they STINK. Like I had just opened a new bottle of acetone and took a sniff. Yuck. I had to hand wash them several times then let them air for a few days before I could tolerate using them. Just a warning to those with sensitive noses.</li>
    <li> Great shipping...&lt;br /&gt;Product brand new but these things are a pain to use. I don&#x27;t recommend buying them.</li>
    <li> Great item - Great service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other products like this, and for some reason, these are much harder to use and don&#x27;t make as nice of buns</li>
    <li> I bought two and they work perfect.. I use them to make mermaid curls. They are easy to sleep in</li>
    <li> They all work really well not exactly what I wanted but they work fine</li>
    <li> I am not a do-my-hair-every-day pro, so I was a bit scared to try something new...but I am so glad I did!!! These are SO easy to use! I have a lot of hair and have no trouble putting it up using the larger of these donut-makers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with these sponges.  I bought them for my 4 yr old to use during dance class and they worked great. I also tried them out in my super think mid-back length hair and was shocked that it worked! I had to play around with them and slide it around when it was up t o hide the black color but it turned out great.  Follow directions, practice, and move it around a little.  I would recommend Bobby pinning it in place for strenuous activity.  Very happy with product, price, and shipping speed.</li>
    <li> So easy and looks very pretty.  This is my second pack as I gave away me other ones due to short hair and now mine had grown out I needed the larger ones</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work as well as I wanted them too. Can&#x27;t seem to hold a bun.</li>
    <li> eh, couldn&#x27;t get them to hold my shoulder-blade length hair.</li>
    <li> They work and are great to just toss your hair up, but if you are looking for that really full bun and have anything but super long thick hair you won&#x27;t be impressed.  I have thick medium length hair and these give an okay bun, but you need the round bun wraps for that super thick big bun.  I will say these are great though when you don&#x27;t have a hair elastic or are doing things around the house and just want your hair up and out of the way, these also are great when I&#x27;m doing yoga as they don&#x27;t bother you at all when in your hair. The material is super soft and they are very flexible.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and i wanted an easier way to put my hair in a bun. This did make it easy but its not ideal for thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t make a neat big bun it makes a tiny squeezed in bun. if you have thick long hair this will not look great on you! the concept is there but i think the product needs something to close it together cause the bun is separated once you wrap it around there&#x27;s a little gap. This would work great for working out since its so tight and put together just no ideal for a night out bun!</li>
    <li> I use it for work and it lasts all day. No more hairs sticking out. I wish I knew about this product years ago.</li>
    <li> I like using these to pull my hair up without rubber bands or clips.</li>
    <li> We use these for ballet--couldn&#x27;t get my 10 year old ready without them!</li>
    <li> Interesting design that actually works.  I have shoulder length straight hair, and can get a low chignon or a half-up half-down look easily. Tried when hair is wet and it created loose curls.  Easy to take off too. Doesn&#x27;t grab hair.</li>
