      <li>Super pure and emollient.</li>
      <li>Quick shipment, and packaged very well.  </li>
      <li>My first review was not posted.</li>
      <li>Thank you for such a phenomenal product.  </li>
      <li>Will most definitely purchase it again.  </li>
      <li>It has a pretty ivory color and is very creamy and absorbs in the skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The product was shipped properly and arrived very quickly, and even though I live in a very hot climate nothing had leaked.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If I use it in lotions or on my son&#x27;s eczema, it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing as easily at the yellow shea butter.</li>
      <li>Again, the yellow butter is fine, just not what I purchased.</li>
      <li>The yellow butter I received is fine.</li>
      <li>went on to make some body butter and facial moisturizer, and after tentatively testing it out I am now comfortable using this product all over, as I am not breaking out from it.</li>
      <li>yes, this is a very high-quality product</li>
      <li>and I really didn&#x27;t want the headache of exchanging it for the correct product.</li>
      <li>other than that I love the product and service.</li>
      <li>Keeps dry winter skin healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>Love how the double filtration made a smooth outcome of the product and how it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin nor hair.</li>
      <li>4 stars because I would LOVE for this same product to come in a larger container (ex.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I ever bought and subsequently used shea butter, and since I am prone to breaking out I searched high and low for a good quality, raw shea butter that would not cause me to break out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this to make my own hair and skin cream with a little EVOO, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil and a hint of fragrance from any essential oil of my choice.</li>
      <li>And WoW Again!  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel soft and looking shiny.</li>
      <li>Much lighter than &amp;#34;golden Shea&amp;#34; or African Butter.</li>
      <li>you just have to work it thru your fingers and it has a natural smell.</li>
      <li>The yellow butter leaves a yellow cast on the skin until it is fully absorbed.</li>
      <li>I like the yellow raw shea.butter better.</li>
      <li>I was using the yellow unfiltered version and this stuff is exactly the same, just a lighter color.</li>
      <li>I buy this stuff for several purposes and I can&#x27;t find this size in the store where I live.  </li>
      <li>It smells the same, the consistency is the same, but the color is a much lighter.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and well moisturized, would definitely recommend this product.</li>

    <li> Such a great product.  Not gritty at all like some others!  I am buying more today!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use this to make all my face and body creams.</li>
    <li> Great product! Keeps dry winter skin healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> Conditions skin without the  greasy feel</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is SUPER CREAMY  AND SMOOTH! No grit whatsoever. Its perfect for making body butters, soaps, lip balms etc... And the natural nutty smell is very light. Much lighter than &amp;#34;golden Shea&amp;#34; or African Butter. Great quality.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU! This shea butter is beautiful! It is soft nice mild smell and easy on my mixer. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> Very good service, love the product, only quip I have , next time I will get the whipped shea buttrer. You have to warm it in the palm of your hand to smooth on your face or body. other than that I love the product and service.Vera</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Amazing deal for the price this stuff will last for months. Its absolutley great for your skin, its a ultimate moisturizer after a show leaves your skin very smooth. The shea butter is not too hard you just have to work it thru your fingers and it has a natural smell. Put it on stretch marks,dry skin and even minor cuts. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Well worthwhile investment.  This product will change the way you think about shea butter because it&#x27;s soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is the shea butter that I like the best! It has a pretty ivory color and is very creamy and absorbs in the skin. I immediately fell in love with it when I first saw it and tried it. I use this to make my own hair and skin cream with a little EVOO, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil and a hint of fragrance from any essential oil of my choice. Use a blender, and there you have it whipped shea butter cream. Makes my skin feel soft and looking shiny. I have already purchased another from the Seller and look forward to receiving it. Thanks! :)))</li>
    <li> Great product with speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I use shea butter for my skin and hair. Love how the double filtration made a smooth outcome of the product and how it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin nor hair. It also helps to lock in moisture as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 4 stars because I would LOVE for this same product to come in a larger container (ex. 56oz or 64oz one container). Then it will be perfect (5 stars)!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be keeping this company for future purchases!</li>
    <li> Soft and creamy I love it! Arrived 3 days before estimated delivery!</li>
    <li> This was the first time I ever bought and subsequently used shea butter, and since I am prone to breaking out I searched high and low for a good quality, raw shea butter that would not cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped properly and arrived very quickly, and even though I live in a very hot climate nothing had leaked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on to make some body butter and facial moisturizer, and after tentatively testing it out I am now comfortable using this product all over, as I am not breaking out from it. The facial moisturizer I made with this evened out my skin a bit and it is less oily during the day. It almost seems like I was using a powder to achieve a matte sheen, which I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, this is a very high-quality product and I recommend it to those who are looking for a raw base for natural moisturizer.</li>
    <li> the shea butter was more than I expected, it arrived before time, iam very pleased will order again!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff for several purposes and I can&#x27;t find this size in the store where I live.  I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I like the yellow raw shea.butter better. This shea butter (the white) seemed gritty to me when I used on my skin. Other than.that it does.the same as the yellow shea butter. Product arrived on time, mayne.even.before time.</li>
    <li> I was using the yellow unfiltered version and this stuff is exactly the same, just a lighter color. It smells the same, the consistency is the same, but the color is a much lighter. It&#x27;s not white white like I expected, but it&#x27;s an off white with a yellow tinge to it. At any rate, I like this much better. If I use it in lotions or on my son&#x27;s eczema, it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing as easily at the yellow shea butter.</li>
    <li> It did not coms yet, but I know I love it.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and well moisturized, would definitely recommend this product. Will most definitely purchase it again.  Very good color and quality</li>
    <li> I love Shea butter and I will order more. The texture is creamy and it works great on dry skin</li>
    <li> I love this product and look forward to becoming a long term consumer.if you have considered trying it please do.you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> Great Product Smooth like it ;)</li>
    <li> I am giving this product three stars because I received yellow butter instead of the advertised ivory butter. That being said, I did contact the seller about the error and received a prompt apology. The yellow butter I received is fine. It is similar in smell and texture to the ivory butter I have received from this seller in the past. The yellow butter leaves a yellow cast on the skin until it is fully absorbed. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that, but it is very moisturizing and I really didn&#x27;t want the headache of exchanging it for the correct product. So ultimately I&#x27;m disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive what was advertised and the seller didn&#x27;t really care. Again, the yellow butter is fine, just not what I purchased. I don&#x27;t know  if I&#x27;ll chance purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> came sooner than expected which is great. it feels great and i can tell its been filtered by the the clean consistency of the color.</li>
    <li> And WoW Again!  This unrefined Ivory is amazingly good.  I have been spoiling my full body since receiving this and it really leaves your skin &amp; hair feeling naturally soft, healthy and even tone.  I&#x27;m back to order the 32oz just to have it before the cold months.  I&#x27;m sending my daughter some out of state also.  I love eating healthy and keeping my skin &amp; hair naturally healthy.  Thank you for such a phenomenal product.  Quick shipment, and packaged very well.  Thank You AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I love it very soft love the smell</li>
    <li> I luv this stuff it always makes my curls come out great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for everything... Hands, cuticles, hair, face. Super pure and emollient. Lasts forever.</li>
    <li> As always wonderful! Last time I bought it I got it in 4 days. This time it took longer but when I sent an email as to why to hold up I got an immediate reply.</li>
    <li> I love this pure Shea butter. IT is the best moisturizer you can use and so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> My first review was not posted. I ordered IVORY and received YELLOW. It&#x27;s extremely grainy, and i have stopped using because it irritates my eczema.</li>
