      <li>Glides on very smooth and stays nicely through the day.</li>
      <li>Love it, really nice.</li>
      <li>The first day I tried this, it was great.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and so when buying eye makeup, I try to opt for products that apart from being safe are also able to stay on for atleast</li>
      <li>but I have used better.</li>
      <li>It is okay</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s easy to re-apply.</li>
      <li>Smears, sweats off easily.</li>
      <li>I sweat easily</li>
      <li>got this and so much more when I bought Maybelline&#x27;s Colossal Kajal.</li>
      <li>review is also available on my blog Njkinny&#x27;s World of Books &amp; Stuff</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybelline&#x27;s Colossal Kajal comes in an eye catching, bright yellow pack.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>I was really excited because my liner always smears off.</li>
      <li>It is fair enough.</li>
      <li>Very handy liner.. goes on smooth - rich black color.</li>
      <li>chandni bazaar thank you so much !!</li>
      <li>The product is of good quality and the shipping speed was quicker than expected.</li>
      <li>The Colossal Kajal from Maybelline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>safe for our eyes and causes no irritation and infection which I can vouch for since I have sensitive eyes and have faced no issues with this product on this front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Maybelline Colossal Kajal eyeliner pencil stays put</li>
      <li>I love this product and will definitely re-buy it.</li>
      <li>I work in a highly hot and steamy job and</li>
      <li>If I am asked what are the top fashion products I always carry with me, my answer would definitely include my favourite Kajal :</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t ease on and show up as much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seeing how much I like this product, I thought of sharing my experience with you in the form of a review!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought because the reviews was good but in me the kajal fixed just few hours</li>
      <li>Claiming a smudge free experience of upto twelve hours, this kajal caught my eye a few years back when I had been on a lookout for a kajal which would not smudge easily.  </li>
      <li>n not a waste.</li>
      <li>The pencil is very skinny, and short.</li>
      <li>my earliest estimated arrival date was July 10 (to July 30), but wow, it arrived June 27.  </li>
      <li>Nice kajal without irritating the eyes</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried every which way to sharpen the kajal/kohl pencils i&#x27;ve found available, and i simply make a mess of it every time.  </li>
      <li>a rich black colour which instantly highlights the eyes leaving them looking beautiful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sold by SpicesWorld, apparently in india.  </li>
      <li>However, you need to be careful with the stick and not roll out too much while applying the kajal as this can cause the stick to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so a pencil really lasts only as long as the original sharpening lasts, and i can&#x27;t tell you how annoyed that makes me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was really excited because my liner always smears off. The first day I tried this, it was great. Unfortunately, it smears just like the rest and I look like I have a black eye.</li>
    <li> It is okay and it does show on the eyes which is a good thing. But it doesn&#x27;t ease on and show up as much. The pencil is very skinny, and short. For me , I was fooled. For some people it might be excellent for them but I have used better. Just being honest.</li>
    <li> chandni bazaar thank you so much !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s. Very nice I like it</li>
    <li> The item got delivered soon than expected. Nice kajal without irritating the eyes</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly yet I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a 12 hour lasting eyeliner. Sucks they don&#x27;t sell it in stores. And I had to wait a long time to get it.</li>
    <li> Impractical where Achrist and spreads</li>
    <li> If I am asked what are the top fashion products I always carry with me, my answer would definitely include my favourite Kajal : The Colossal Kajal from Maybelline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing how much I like this product, I thought of sharing my experience with you in the form of a review!&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline&#x27;s Colossal Kajal comes in an eye catching, bright yellow pack. Claiming a smudge free experience of upto twelve hours, this kajal caught my eye a few years back when I had been on a lookout for a kajal which would not smudge easily.  I sweat easily and so when buying eye makeup, I try to opt for products that apart from being safe are also able to stay on for atleast a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this and so much more when I bought Maybelline&#x27;s Colossal Kajal. This kajal is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) a rich black colour which instantly highlights the eyes leaving them looking beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;2) smudge proof and water resistant and stays put for atleast 8 hours as tested by me. No need to touch up and re-apply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) safe for our eyes and causes no irritation and infection which I can vouch for since I have sensitive eyes and have faced no issues with this product on this front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) comes in a trendy retractable stick. No sharpening is required for the kajal. However, you need to be careful with the stick and not roll out too much while applying the kajal as this can cause the stick to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) a combination of 5 nourishing ingredients which include Vitamin E which soothes and nourishes our eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) priced moderately and is definitely a steal at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict: I love this product and will definitely re-buy it. Recommended to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is also available on my blog Njkinny&#x27;s World of Books &amp; Stuff</li>
    <li> Smears, sweats off easily.</li>
    <li> i ordered this for my wife and she loved it, she says it does not smudge or cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> Love it, really nice. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> The product is of good quality and the shipping speed was quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> Little too smudgy to me but I like how dark it is, overall I can wear it n not a waste.</li>
    <li> yay!  looked and looked for an automatic kajal/kohl pencil.  i&#x27;ve tried every which way to sharpen the kajal/kohl pencils i&#x27;ve found available, and i simply make a mess of it every time.  so a pencil really lasts only as long as the original sharpening lasts, and i can&#x27;t tell you how annoyed that makes me.  i should have known i should look on Amazon for it.  here&#x27;s the perfect automatic pencil for me.  It&#x27;s sold by SpicesWorld, apparently in india.  (it seems this maybelline product is not available in USA.)  my earliest estimated arrival date was July 10 (to July 30), but wow, it arrived June 27.  amazing.  i am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;teresa</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected. It works well and does the job. I heard great things and saw people praising it. Not impressed. I&#x27;ll stick to benift</li>
    <li> I love it. I work in a highly hot and steamy job and all the other so called waterproof eyeliners fall very short of what they promise. The Maybelline Colossal Kajal eyeliner pencil stays put and I am still wearing it after a long day of work and even after I shower it&#x27;s still on my eyes where I put it. I don&#x27;t have raccoon eyes and no smudges or smears under the eye either. I have to say I am extremely happy with this product and will buy it again and again. I tell everybody about it.</li>
    <li> For some reason it made the skin over my eyes dry and I dont use it anymore</li>
    <li> Very handy liner.. goes on smooth - rich black color. Seems to wears off as the day goes on but it&#x27;s easy to re-apply. I&#x27;m ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by the quality. The vendor sent me old stock and the kajal was of very bad quality. An option to return the item does not seem feasible either as the postage required to return the item would exceed the cost of the actual item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as black as I wanted it but it was good</li>
    <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> Not so good as I was expecting it to be. I&#x27;m disapointed</li>
    <li> Really nice! Glides on very smooth and stays nicely through the day. Great for summer! Color is a little lighter than expected.</li>
    <li> I bought because the reviews was good but in me the kajal fixed just few hours</li>
