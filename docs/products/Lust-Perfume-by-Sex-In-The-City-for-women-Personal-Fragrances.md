<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the scent and the price. I always have bottles of this on hand in my house. There is not a scent of Sex in the City I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Not too bad considering the low price, but remember..,you get what you pay for. Very light, crisp and fresh scent. Not heavy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume for my daughter as a Christmas present. The price made this item a great value. The container is really cute.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter for christmas and it was a great hit. She loved the scent and I loved the price. I wasnt sure if it was going to be the real perfume because the price was so reasonable, and to my surprise it was a beautiful big box of Sex in The City.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the smell of this perfume!! I have LOTS &amp; LOTS of allergies and was a little worried when I ordered it, but once I got it and smelled it, I was amazed at how good it smelled and how \\&quot;not so strong, but strong enough\\&quot; for me it was and I fell deeply in LOVE with it!!!!!   I recommend to anyone who is interested in it because it is amazingly wonderful!!!!!     ~XxooxXCotysGirlXxooxX~</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of perfume from them, it was cracked, leaking, and missing about 20% of the contents. I asked them the seller to ship a new one....the second one was worst than the first. Again, it was leaking, missing contents, and the knob wont push down. I had to throw away both bottles! Such a waste of my time and money!!!!</li>
    <li> I got these at an amazing price, but shocked at the cost of shipping.  The product was bigger than I expected.  The smell is OK.  Can&#x27;t go too wrong when you buy a nice bottled perfume under $2.00.  They made nice gifts.</li>
    <li> When I bought this as a stocking stuffer I thought it was going to be a lot smaller. It&#x27;s huge, great price for amount you get. It smells pretty, but it doesn&#x27;t last a long time, that&#x27;s the only downside.</li>
    <li> Whenever I go away, I try to take a few gifts for my female friends.  That can sometimes be expensive.  I purchased several of these Sex In The City perfumes ... and the ladies were very appreciative.  Don&#x27;t let the name of the perfume confuse you ... just a lovely, lovely scent (and not expensive).</li>
    <li> I was a little bit skeptical after reading the comments some of the people wrote about this product. I must say that I am pleased with it though&gt; Only a couple of sprays and it lasts for quite a while. I love the smell too, and it reminds me of one of Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfumes. Great buy +great price! Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> El producto vino con defectos, ya que el atomizador no tiene fuerza, y aplicarmelo se me hace desagradable, debido a que se moja todo el envase. Soy de Venezuela por eso no tuve formas de regresarlo</li>
    <li> just got this item today. true the smell is not very strong i had to spray it several times. But it was a fresh smell. and really it was light and when you think about it light perfumes are good i dont want to smell like a big batch of alcohol drenched perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn LUST for the last 2 years, purchased in Manhattan.  I decided to buy online and what I received smells completely different than the original fragrance.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> At first I was like did this just evaporate in  midair like rubbing alcohol lol so I sprayed it again and give it a couple minutes the scent had faded dramatically in a bad way that is. I should have known this was too good to be true.....</li>
    <li> El agua de perfume Sex and the city lo compre por curiosidad al recibirlo he visto su buena y atractiva presentacion, pero el producto en si no me satisface pues no perdura la fragancia.</li>
    <li> My mom purchased this item and I loved it. I looked for it in stores and I haven&#x27;t been lucky finding it so I decided to search online and there it was on amazon and unexpectantly reasonable, but satisfied. It&#x27;s a nice fragrance, it puts me in the mind of Ralph Lauren \\&quot;COOL\\&quot;. Nice floral scent. Very pleased with the seller.</li>
    <li> i thought it will be much better then this, it is totaly has different smell then the ones in the malls.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in perfect condition, I am very satisfied with the purchase. is what is described in the purchase, thanks</li>
    <li> Amazing Service, provided fast and very helpful reply. Will recommend to anybody who is looking for low cost fragrance. Will buy again very soon!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girl, she loves it! I&#x27;m not too familiar with Woman&#x27;s perfumes, but I atleast know that this one is an acceptable gift to girlfriends, maybe even family.   Great shipping time, and great product. Will definitely be buying more items from the seller, except this time, a little gift for myself :)</li>
    <li> my wife is happy with it smell soft, fresh and the big bottle, and I happy to with the on time shipping and the lower price for the cologne I recommend</li>
    <li> When I received the product it looks like somebody opened it before delivering. When I open the package the bottle was shattered and cap was broken. But the smell is real good. I was not so angry because it was real cheap. but will definitely not buy again.</li>
    <li> Ok don&#x27;t stay on long but smells good.</li>
    <li> This order arrived quickly and undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited when I ordered this parfum. Sure it would be a hit. For 15 minutes it was, then it was barely noticeable. After an hour, it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I will rate most anything 2 stars just for arriving on time and undamaged. But, can only give one additional star to this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;When first applied, comments were floral, fresh, awakening, classy, elegant, sophisticated, and wow! It smelled great. I thought for sure I would be ordering a bunch more of these. But, that was it. An hour later, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the time I think it is hard to be disappointed with a low price product. It does smell great, even if only very briefly. That is why this is so disappointing, if only the scent would last it would be worth 3 times the price or more. In this case, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the perfume. Her girlfriends all wanted to smell her. She recommended your site to her friends. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My wife was very shocked when she got because she always had that perfume. She really doesn&#x27;t use any other kind of perfume.</li>
    <li> The product was great.  I got my perfume quickly.  The retailer was very professional and reliable.  I also loved the price.  It was definitely a bargain!</li>
    <li> I order this perfume for the low price of 6.99. I thought I was going to get this tiny bottle, and instead I was surprised and delighted to recieve a huge bottle. The perfume is a very nice fragrance, and the bottle is very pretty. I am quite pleased with my purchase:)</li>
    <li> HUGE bottle for cheap...not sure I like the scent, but it&#x27;s a collector&#x27;s piece for sure!</li>
    <li> This is a FAKE perfume. When I received it in the mail, the name on the bottle is SEXY CITY, not Sex In The City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells okay but nothing like the real one. Not really sure if it is worth buying because not sure if the scent even lasts that long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. The scent is rather cheap and it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I guess you get what you pay for. My advice...... Just spend the 30-100 bucks on some worthwhile scents.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. Light &amp; sweet.  Not overpowering but soft &amp; subtle.  Good fragrance to wear every day.  Doesn&#x27;t last all day though.</li>
    <li> First thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is name of it is different from the original. The name on the bottle is sexy city!! The real name should have been sex in the city!! I have had the original sex in the city perfume and it smells great, but this product I recieved sucks and has a very alcohol smell to it!! It doesn&#x27;t smell like the original at all!! My husband loves the smell of sex in the city perfume and the first time I but this one on he said what the heck are u wearing it smells like u poured a bottle of Acohol on ur self!! So not happy with this purchase at all!! Don&#x27;t even deserve a 1star rating!! UGHH!!</li>
    <li> for the money, you cant beat it. The scent does not stay with you long, as i use it as a body spray when getting out of shower.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting that large of a bottle for the price I paid for it, but it was big!!!  It also smells incredible!  Nicely packaged &amp; fast shipping!!  Very happy!</li>
    <li> i wear everday around house it dont stay on long but for price it ok i bought the other names</li>
    <li> The bottle is nice. My woman liked it and the sent too. Good shipment timing. This cologne is a nice ornament for her dresser and thats about it.</li>
    <li> I ordered Sex in the city one but i just got the Sexycity. What is that? Is it fake? And it was 2 week to delivered. So awful.</li>
    <li> Great price , smells just like the real deal , I&#x27;m so going to buy this again instead of going to the store</li>
    <li> ordered 11/7/13 received on 11/12/13 (but says it would be delivered 11/19-28/13 so I got it in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is good, comes just as it is pictured. Came with deodorant spray as well. Even though it says &amp;#34;Sexy City&amp;#34; in the photo, my box says &amp;#34;Sex in the City&amp;#34; so I am not sure about the photo. The perfume is a pretty good size for the price.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that, even though the scent is very pleasant &amp; fresh, it DOES NOT last long AT ALL! I would say maybe no more than 15/20 minutes and you cannot smell it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I had this perfume before (bought in mall) &amp; it lasted very long so I am assuming it is watered down. that is the only reason why perfume would not last longer than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;So, I dont really recommend this product because of that unless you dont mind spraying over and over all day &amp; then in about a month it will be all gone.</li>
    <li> I love sex in the city lust has a Wonderful scent. It is a very good perfume. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Its not worth the price even thought it was not expensive. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s how it is or its a fake one</li>
    <li> First off ,I thought the name of the perfume was Sex In the City..It was not that...It was sexy city?  not the greatest scent,But fast delivery</li>
    <li> the scent itself is not really all that and it does not last throughout the day. in fact, when i spray it on each morning i could hardly smell it on me...It actually does smell alot like Mariah&#x27;s Lollipop Bling Honey. I guess you get what you paid for...</li>
    <li> Smells cheap and wears off very quickly. Also the bottle leaked while shipping and ruined the label and box</li>
    <li> This is not what I recieved.  I received Sex in the City Lust2.  It smells absolutely nothing like the original.  I was very dissatisfied.  It was too much of a headache to return it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and sexy in a subtle way. The nozzle sprays a light mist, so it&#x27;s the perfect dosage for work when you don&#x27;t want to knock people out with your perfume. I always get compliments on it, but only after I hug them, not when I enter the room. Very classy and pretty. I do get funny comments on the bottle though, it looks a little odd sitting on my vanity.</li>
    <li> If u buy this and you are expecting Lust then u will be disappointed!!! The fragrance is not LUST this is Sex City NOT Sex in the City look at the box and the bottle. Look closely before you buy anything!!! When buying make sure it says Sex IN THE City on the bottle not sex city.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised, tho I figured it would smell great. I love the beads in the bottle...wish all perfumes would do that. However, the scent doesnt last long at all.</li>
    <li> cheapest price i have ever seen. perfume is legit :). I have seen many other products for great prices as well and will be ordering them soon too. Thanks bestdealz</li>
    <li> This perfume smells sooo good!! of the love and lust ones, the lust def smells more like a perfume! I like it a lot, and the smell lasts, the love smells good more of a fruity shampoo smell also I love them both!</li>
    <li> I took a chance and scored big time. My wife love it and getting compliments.She want another order very soon</li>
    <li> Pretty sure it was fake. You should avoid buying perfume made in China.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume for arnd $3 and I&#x27;m not sure if it was bcs of the price, the seller or the brand itself, but the smell does not last more than 15 minutes, it feels like it&#x27;s very watered down and smells cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I felt I didn&#x27;t have much to lose paying only $3.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok though, it serves as an air freshener for the bathroom at least.</li>
    <li> very good scent but the smell will soon expire from clothes..</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000UOKXTY Sex In The City Lust for Women, Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Ounces]]I WAS SKEPTICAL ABT BUYING THIS PRODUCT AT FIRST AFTER READING SOME NEGATIVE REVIEWS.. AT LEAST I KNW WHAT THESE PPL WERE TALKING ABT. I WAS ALL HYPE WHEN I SAW MY PACKAGE TODAY, OPENED IT ONLY TO FIND OUT IT WAS FLAVORED WATER. LOL... BUT DATS THE END!! FOR SEX IN THE CITY PRODUCTS....</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product.  Everyone says it has a wonderful smell and it is perfect for day or evening wear.</li>
    <li> The smell was gone within minutes no matter how much i applied.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume and bought it at a store for $40. I am so surprised to see it at such a low price. Cant wait to gift this her!</li>
    <li> It is actually Lust 2, which I think is a knock off. It smell similar, but it was deceiving and that&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like about it the most!</li>
    <li> The fragrance was pretty good, but I rather have had &amp;#34;Fantastic&amp;#34; that is a very good fragrance.</li>
    <li> UGH!  I was so excited to receive this product. I used to wear this perfume a few years back.  This is NOT  Lust by Sex in the City.  What I received was more like rubbing alcohol and a bit of fragrance.  Look at the ingredients and it&#x27;s 90% rubbing alchohol.  I&#x27;m really sad:(  I make minimum wage I don&#x27;t got time for this s***.</li>
    <li> The scent was nice but very very weak. I have to spray a lot just to smell it and it only lasts a short time. Would not buy this product or recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a fragrance good for daily use, I recommend this, I bought for my wife and delighted to have a perfume for those events Extra departures occasional or frequent nearby home.</li>
    <li> This  should be called a body spray not a perfume. It stinks! yek! and i will not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product</li>
    <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very light smell.  Doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes.  But ok while it does last.  More for children.</li>
    <li> I lust this perfume! Very accurate name! This smells so good, its fruity &amp; floral. It smells like something you would pay a lot of money for. Its luxurious, sensual, sophisticated, girly! Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price &amp; brand of this bottle, it does not smell cheap or immature. All I can say is for $8 for a 100ml bottle you have nothing to lose, you will love this! ;)</li>
    <li> not what I was expecting</li>
    <li> I usually buy very expensive perfume and when I got this as a gift, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think. I mean, it&#x27;s SEX AND THE CITY, not SEX IN THE CITY. It smells really good though and I got a lot of compliments on it! For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!!!</li>
    <li> Ad says sex in the city but perfume is sexy city which is a knockoff.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this parfum and nobody had it. I have been looking everywhere. My sister told me to try Amazon and I finally found it. The cost was low and my daughter got what she wanted.</li>
    <li> it smells just so-so, and the smell cannot last long. anyway, i won&#x27;t recommend this perfume to you, even though the name is good</li>
    <li> LOVELY AND SWEET THIS WILL MAKE A SWEET GIFT FOR A LOVER! THE SMELL IS A SEXY ONE! MY MAN LOVES WHEN I WEAR IT! IT WILL MAKE ANY GUY STOP IN THEIR TRACK AND STARE AND WONDER WHAT THE SMELL IS, :). I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL.</li>
    <li> Excelente el producto llego a tiempo a venezuela y en excelente estado lo recomiendo al 100% Gente seria y responsable pueden comprar con toda confianza</li>
    <li> I am a stickler for a good deal. I have several of these sprays and they smell good and are a good price. The scent last reasonably well and are in pretty bottles. The item arrives in a box that is plastic wrapped. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with leakage or this seller. Will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT IS AMAZING, SMELLS GOOD, MY MOM&#x27;S USING IT AND SHE SAYS THAT HAVE A GOOD SMELL FOR LADIES AROUND 25-40</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this partum, I like the shape of the bottle its different and for me different is good.&lt;br /&gt;The partum has a sweet smell I love it.</li>
    <li> I love sex in the city so this is y I bought these perfume....&lt;br /&gt;N the price was awesome n cheap.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2pcs of this perfume and when i got it both bottles are almost empty. First, it&#x27;s not noticeable because both boxes are inside another package but the smell was really all over already. And when the package has been unwrapped, both boxes are wet with spilled perfume. Also, the markings on the bottles have started to peel off... I&#x27;m not buying it anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought it for myself for a treat. I love it. I will get it again.</li>
    <li> excellent product I liked a lot and filled all my expectations surely buy again because I really liked the recomiento</li>
    <li> sex in the city colognes are excellent for the price and size.</li>
    <li> linger, or hold up in the Louisiana heat and humidity, but for the price it is a fantastic buy, the fact that I am a HUGE Sex and the City Fan was the draw. The price sealed the deal.</li>
    <li> This scent smells amazing and is a great scent for the spring and summer. It is light, airy and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This would be good if it did not fade so fast. Nice packaging and that is about it. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It came fast great price smells good but dosent last very long on you it wears off in a hour but I love it</li>
    <li> definatly recommend! It smells great &amp; comes in a really big bottle.</li>
    <li> It smells lovely but it won&#x27;t last not even an hour. I guess I got what I payed for</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT perfume and its a HUGE bottle, was VERY surprised about the price with it, and i go it so fast ! great job thanks !</li>
    <li> What can you expect from the price,regardless of that this perfume is the worst that i ever smell,my girlfriend dislike it a lot,besides that it came in the mail damaged and is more expensive return it that what it cost,next time i will make sure to add a extra 20 dollars to get something that it is worth</li>
